Laurie Anderson, someone else, Alan Sondheim, violin, mandolin, etc.

Again, from what passes for archives.

http://www.alansondheim.org/lauriealan0.mp3

This is from 1975? I lose track of dates. This was recorded in Laurie's
loft; someone else is heard on occasion but who? We played together a few
times. Laurie's early performances were the most amazing I've ever seen.
This cassette is 35 years old and mint. I don't remember playing mandolin
this well. Enjoy.

Bruce Andrews interview at The Argotist Online:

http://www.argotistonline.co.uk/Andrews%20interview.htm


Excerpt:

"Since I=E2=80=99m interested in the experience of the reader, I haven=E2=
=80=99t been interested in chance. Chance might seem to open the possibilit=
ies for the reader to the widest level, but often it doesn=E2=80=99t get th=
e reader anywhere, it=E2=80=99s so open that nothing counts, nothing has an=
y significance, none of the connections are designed to have any effect on =
the reader, and therefore it often seems like it ignores the reader, just a=
s much as any type of closed textual work. So in a weird way chance and the=
 old notion of intentionality end up having the same relationship to the re=
ader, in both cases the reader is ignored. Either you don=E2=80=99t care wh=
at the reader makes of something because there=E2=80=99s not much to make o=
f it, or you ignore the reader because you=E2=80=99ve already figured out w=
hat everything means, maybe they=E2=80=99ll get it maybe they won=E2=80=99t=
, but you don=E2=80=99t care either way because your job is to create this =
edifice, this autotelic text, as if it means by itself and doesn=E2=80=99t =
require the reader to get on board, and if the reader does have some intere=
st in getting on board then they have to pay tuition to take the class to b=
e told what things actually meant as if the lecturer is ventriloquizing the=
 author. You know, if you read old lit crit, it=E2=80=99s often outrageous,=
 the presumptiveness of it. I mean, =E2=80=9Cthis means this, and I know be=
cause this is what the author meant.=E2=80=9D I mean, who the fuck knows wh=
at the author meant? That=E2=80=99s always irritating to me, because it clo=
ses things down. But in a weird way, totally randomizing product does too."

Subject:      A Feminist Perspective/Its Suppression: Iran,
              Israel & the Conspicuous Absence of Nuclear Debate
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=windows-1252
Content-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable

from Jewish Voice for Peace:


In an extensive, research-based 2009 position paper titled: On Nuclear
Weapons: A Feminist Perspective, Ednay Gorney and Hedva Eyal of the Isha
L'Isha Haifa Feminist Center wrote, "the Israeli public remains excluded
from the [nuclear] debate. The public does not ask questions, does not
demand that the state takes responsibility, nor does it demand to be
involved in decision making; it accepts and is content with the information
or, more accurately, with the lack of information."

This passive indifference to the nuclear weaponry widely believed to be in
the public's backyard is, in my view, a highly dangerous manifestation of
Israel's longtime and entrenched militarization. As Gorney and Eyal have pu=
t
it, "Decision-making in all areas related to security is characterized by
secrecy and vagueness, excluding anyone who does not belong to the security
elite. =85 The secret functions both on the outside as well as on the insid=
e.
Denying information under the guise of maintaining secrecy is one of the
common ways through which elites maintain their status. =85 [While o]ne of =
the
ways they can attain legitimacy for their control and actions is to
continuously disseminate and instill fear =96 real and imaginary =96 among =
the
citizens of Israel. This fear justifies and, in turn, foments military powe=
r
and its use against any security threat, as defined by this elite group."

Meanwhile, Gorney and Eyal have noted, "We are flooded with information on
the great threat Iran poses and on the necessity of military operations. Th=
e
debate within the Israeli public discourse is almost devoid of the
possibility of solution through diplomatic means."

Outlining the severely undemocratic suppression of any public nuclear debat=
e
in Israel, the position paper lists a line of researchers, journalists,
politicians, activists and ex-security personnel who's critical voices have
been stifled by the security establishment, using a broad range of tactics.
This in addition to the constant dissemination of fear underpinning
militarization in general and the unquestioning Israeli public acceptance o=
f
its governments' nuclear armament in particular. Thus, the risks of such
armament to this public itself, as well as the entire area or even the
globe, go unexamined and undebated for decades on end.

Resisting this reality and reaching for an actual, participatory democracy,
Gorney and Eyal explain, "As feminists we wish to expose the connections
between the policy of opacity, concealment and fear, and the current
perception of security. We want to take responsibility for our lives and fo=
r
actions carried out in our name."

In one of the rare public voices taking up these issues, the position paper
concludes:
"We demand the removal of opacity surrounding the issue of nuclear weapons
in Israel; We demand a public debate and the development of an alternative
policy that will enable us to live in peace in the Middle East; We demand
nuclear disarmament; We demand that the State of Israel join the
International Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons."

To read the full 22 page position paper, see:

http://www.isha.org.il/files/files/File/1325_reports/On_Nuclear_Weapons.pdf

-----------------------------------------

Another such public voice, sounded now for many years, is that of nuclear
historian and analyst, Avner Cohen, whose work is one of main sources
repeatedly referred to by the Isha L'Isha position paper. Cohen is equally
critical of successive Israeli governments' successful barring of nuclear
debate and, in the recent op-ed forwarded in full below, offers a series of
serious arguments against what he views as the irresponsible and extremely
dangerous possibility that Israel might launch a military attack against
Iran in an attempt to quash its nuclear capacity.

Cohen's op-ed, converging in part with some of the conclusions presented by
the Isha L'Isha position paper, was published April 2nd in Haaretz.

We look at Iran and see ourselves

By Avner Cohen

If Israel takes military action against Iran, it will be one of the biggest
decisions in the history of the state. The risks involved will make it
unprecedented.

There is no comparison between such a decision and the ones that establishe=
d
and implemented the so-called Begin doctrine: the decision by Menachem
Begin's government to attack the Osirak reactor in Iraq in 1981 and the
attack on the nuclear facility in Syria in 2007. In terms of both the
complexity of the military operation and the uncertainty about the
consequences and where they may lead, there is a qualitative difference
between the legacy of the past and the challenge of the present.

The seriousness of the challenge requires as open and thorough a public
discussion as possible. But unfortunately, such a discussion has been
virtually nonexistent, even on a basic conceptual level. Instead of a publi=
c
discussion there has been a belligerent press, which makes demagogic use of
statements that intensify the message of the politics of fear. These includ=
e
expressions such as "Iran is galloping toward a bomb" and a "second
Holocaust" that Israel must prevent. Such discourse creates a feeling that
if Iran is not attacked, and soon, we have no choice but to accept a nuclea=
r
Iran.

It's doubtful whether the people making those statements are capable of
giving them a precise (technical and political) interpretation. It's
doubtful whether they have a suitable answer to the question: When should
Iran be considered a nuclear state? Where exactly is the red line? What is
the precise significance of such a line and what makes it red?

One thing is clear: As long as Iran is a member of the Nuclear
Non-Proliferation Treaty, it will not be able to test a nuclear device or
declare that it has one. Also, as long as Iran is subject to the treaty, it
will not be a nuclear state according to the accepted definition of such a
state.

It's true that under cover of the treaty Iran can get very close to the
nuclear threshold and still claim - as it claims now - that it is not
deviating from its legal obligations under the treaty. Iran as a threshold
state can perhaps even position itself a few weeks away from a nuclear test=
.
Such an Iran, despite supervision by the International Atomic Energy Agency=
,
will of necessity be opaque; there will always remain a fear that it is
working in secret, including making weapons in secret. But even in such a
case, Iran would be considered a threshold state, not an actual nuclear
state.

Even those who disparage the practical limitations of the Nuclear
Non-Proliferation Treaty (as Israelis tend to do) must recognize that it is
almost impossible for Iran to be a nuclear state in the full sense without
withdrawing from the treaty. And even if it is outside the treaty, it will
take Iran years, many years, to make the transition from a threshold state
to a mature nuclear state. Such a transition is not trivial; certainly it i=
s
not inevitable, even if we look at the experience of states that in the pas=
t
were considered threshold states and were not bound by the treaty's
restrictions.

For example, India, which carried out a nuclear test in 1998, is still
making this transition slowly, and many experts say it should still not be
considered a mature nuclear state. Even Pakistan, whose nuclear path was
faster and more purposeful than India's, needed about a generation to becom=
e
a nuclear state to all extents and purposes. In its nuclear behavior Iran i=
s
more like India than Pakistan.

It's ironic that an Iran under attack would probably become more determined
and purposeful in its nuclear ambitions. After an attack, Iran would abando=
n
the treaty in protest, declare its right to nuclear arms and almost
certainly succeed in implementing it.

The public discussion in Israel about a nuclear Iran is simplistic,
inadequate, confused and confusing. It reflects to some degree our own
biases. We come from a culture of national security in which nuclear opacit=
y
has been exploited to the hilt to create a specific model of deterrence. Th=
e
result is that when we look at Iran we see ourselves: how we would behave i=
n
a similar situation. But Iran is not Israel exactly, and the Israeli
experience does not necessarily reflect Iran's behavior. On the contrary, i=
t
leads to systematic errors when making assessments.

The writer is the author of the book "Israel and the Bomb." His forthcoming
book, "The Worst-Kept Secret," will be published in the United States in
September.

Since the Berkeley Campus has long been one of the most activist in the USA=
,
and its actions  very often "read" as the symptoms of a much larger and
steadily growing "malaise," thought to post this as"sings of things to come=
"
in the backlash against what journals in the UK and France have openly
called "The New McCarthyism" in the USA and on US campuses specifically.
This phrase, "The New McCarthyism" refers to the ongoing suppression of
open, public debates and discourses, reporting and research  regarding the
US policies connected with Israel, Iraq, Iran, Afghanistan and many other
people, places, events lumped together under various slogans and catchwords=
,
reporting and research.  Since this suppression of Free Speech is done in
the name of "Homeland Security, "The War on Terror," etc it essays to wrap
censorship, silencing, "forcing one  to speak" as a form of psychological
terrorism in the America Flag.  As was pointed out by Hermann Goering durin=
g
his trial at Nuremberg, even the most educated, sophisticated, respected
citizens will give up just about everything, including Freedom of Speech,
when confronted with a Threat--real or not--to their personal Security
and/or that of the Homeland. So it is that even the "most secure"
academics,bureaucrats, artists, poets, will gladly "hand over," or "report
on" any thing and anyone they regard as a potential "threat," and/or an
"existential threat."

While Goering openly stated that even fabricated threats may be used to
create the "atmosphere of fear, necessary for the "handing over of rights t=
o
Freedom of Speech," today in the USA such an admission is not accepted.
Despite all the "faked" evidence of the last roughly nine years, one is
supposed to unquestioningly believe any new
"information" provided by the Israelis, as well as the Americans, In re som=
e
of the effects on American campuses, a number of Professors in the US have
lost their jobs and had their published works and persons persistently
attacked by pro-Israeli groups in the US, and, since January of 2009, have
experienced  an "open assault" conducted by the Israeli State's policy of
"going after" any criticism of its policies shown on you tube, twitter,
blogs, etc.  Seven Palestinian students who had been awarded Fulbright
fellowships to study at various American Universities were blocked from
attending these institutions by refusal of visas to them by the Israeli
State.  (Eventually, under much pressure, one student was finally granted a
visa.)  Currently over 600 Palestinian students with grants nd fellowships
to study at foreign institutions are being refused visas to study aboard.
This, coupled withe systematic bombing and destruction of schools for
students of al ages, has severely curtailed the educational opportunities
for Palestinians who want to become doctors, nurses, engineers, teachers so
that their fellows may be prepared for peace time jobs, in which capacity
they would be working for a future Palestinian State aimed at developing
conditions which would NOT encourage and nurture terrorism and violence.
People being busy studying and working with definite and promising, peacefu=
l
goals in mind are going to be far less interested in jeopardizing their
country and country persons by irrational acts By torpedoing such education
and jobs in Palestine and by  banning Palestinians from American
institutions, the Israeli State is directly affecting the Americans'
opportunities to meet Palestinians in a peaceful and cooperative situation.
By also attacking any speech, videos, professors, publications, presses fro=
m
contributing positively to a discourse, a debate,  whether critical or
positive of the actions and policies of the Israeli State and its support
groups aboard, the options of education about the actual aims and goals, th=
e
dreams and hopes of Palestinians and other peoples in the US, the option of
their being shared openly with the American people, is being thwarted by a
power not elected by the American people. This in itself poses a threat to
future American openness to ideas and points of view both inside and outsid=
e
the US, and makes the students of today as well as the citizenry, ever more
ignorant of all but one side of the question, of al but one side of
discourses and debates. Effectively, American Institutions are being asked
to do the work of the Israeli State and its support groups, at the expense
of al others' histories, cultures, economic situations, of their poetries,
musics, political and philosophical thinking etc etc--

This "New McCarthyism" is one of the ongoing situations which the Berkeley
events and Naomi Klein's letter to the Berkeley Students is hoping, in part
to ameliorate. Such a "New McCarthyism" hurts everyone--Israelis,
Palestinians and Americans. By fostering, emphasizing and forcibly creating
an atmosphere of fear,distrust, hatred and paranoia, based on deliberate
mis- and disinformation, all peoples and the hope for a Peaceful debate and
discussion hopefully bringing about  Peaceful generations who can trust and
learn frm each other how to create a Peaceful outcome to the present
situation does npot need to be destroyed by such tactics as are presently
being employed.

NAOMI KLEIN | When it comes to acting to end Israeli war crimes, the
international response has not suffered from too much haste but from far to=
o
little.

here are some (almost all ) very recent links regarding the situation re
Palestinians, Americans and Israelis and their various positions regarding
the events discussed above
and an older post is one dealing specifically with the seven denied--and on=
e
letter allowed--admission to the USA to study on Fulbright Fellowships
A rapidly growing Non Violent Protest movement organized by Jewish,
Palestinian and Christian groups has beenstaging ever more proetests in
Isarel and inside the Occupied Territories including within Gaza.
The Israeli State has begun an open policy of suppression of any Peace
movements within Israel, whether those organized by former IDF soldiers or
religious and Human Rights activists, including students.
The major policy now of protest groups both within and outside Israel world
wide including in/at the borders with Palestine, is that of Non-Violence.
There is a growing in terst in the study of Gandhi and his effective method=
s
in India, and those of Reverend Doctor martin Luther King, Jr in the USA.
Non-Violence may, once again, prove to be the most effective approach to
Violence, Occupation, illegal Sieges, the building of Apartheid and Border
Walls in Israel and world wide--including those the USA has built and is
building in Ira and Afghanistan as well as along the USA-Mexican Border,
which is being built by a combined US-Isreali group of engineers,
"contractors" and corporations.

A high-yield=2C low-fallout .01 megaton directed-discharge thermonuclear de=
vice the size of a baseball is now being manufactured by an Israeli weapons=
 plant.  Similar weapons the size of a gallon jug were being made here in t=
he US in the early 1970s.  Exactly what further technological advances have=
 been made?  Word is out and about that such a weapon was used to vaporize =
the core columns of the two WTC towers that came down on 9/11/2001.  We sho=
uld all be asking questions about both our military's and private contracto=
r's store of weapons whose existence has yet to be broadcast to the populat=
ion at large.  Naturally what I just said about the Twin Towers sounds susp=
iciously like a "conspiracy theory" because no one knows that such highly d=
eveloped weapons even exist=2C and therefore have no option to believe that=
 such things could happen.  But they do.

Yes, it's true! I thought you might be wondering if it isn't true, but
it is true! I know sometimes people put vague headlines that aren't
true, like, "You won a million dollars," or, "I care about your
feelings," but this one is true! Unlikely Stories will be reading
off-site at the AWP Conference in Denver, with Ahadada Books!

Check us out:
*Saturday*, April 10, 2010
*7:00pm - 11:00pm
Michelangelo's Wine and Coffee Bar
1 Broadway Suite B*
Denver, Colorado

Where you'll hear readings by Janée J. Baugher, Wendy Taylor Carlisle,
Amy Catanzano, León De la Rosa, Adam Halbur, Judy Halebsky, Michael
Harold, Deb Hoag, Anne McMillen, Jared Schickling, Judith Skillman,
Jeffrey Spahr-Summers, Donna Snyder, Dayana Stetco, Violetta Tarpinian,
Donald Wellman, Lawrence Welsh and Joe Zanghi! That's funky, avant-garde
and transgressive literature by eighteen writers from Japan, Germany,
Mexico, and the U.S.!

And because we're all way too busy to have dealt with it properly,
submissions for /Unlikely Stories of the Third Kind/ have been *extended
to April 30th*! That's like May Day, except as an American I don't know
what May Day is! So head over to
http://www.unlikelystories.org/printsubmissions.shtml and catch your
only chance to be in a physical, multimedia edition of /Unlikely
Stories/ for a long, long, long time!

"Century XX after Four Quartets" by Adam Fieled at The Argotist Online

http://www.argotistonline.co.uk/Fieled%20essay%202.htm


Excepts:


"What do we see around us in 2010? It is a poetry world stumbling for direc=
tion, still largely lost in the theoretical wilderness of post-modernism...=
"=20

"I do not believe that much English language poetry composed after 1943, th=
e year that Eliot=E2=80=99s Four Quartets were released, deserves the title=
 of high art. Before I explain why the twentieth century, post Four Quartet=
s, was mostly a washout for English language poetry, let me explain what di=
stinctions I believe subsist between high and low art. "

"Low art impulses often maintain a stance that technical competence is unne=
cessary, that breadth of vision is too ambitious, that narrative solidity i=
s a remnant of the nineteenth century...and that =E2=80=9Cseriousness=E2=80=
=9D is an outdated and outmoded concern. "

"... Eliot=E2=80=99s language is taut, sinewy, disciplined, and rich [and] =
makes the whole of Four Quartets ring as a solid, major work of high litera=
ry art. If another such work exists that was released between 1943 and 2000=
, I haven=E2=80=99t seen it."

"The Objectivists, the Beats, the New York School (first and second generat=
ion), the Confessional poets=E2=80=94what do these poets lack, so that the =
appellation high art does not affix to their work ..."

"...Objectivists, the Beats, and the New York School poets, fall squarely u=
nder the rubric that covers minor poetry and poets, when placed next to the=
 scope and achievements of Eliot and Yeats."

This is great news for those of us already doing this. Maybe it being in th=

Subject:      John Cassavetes' "A Woman Under the Influence"
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=ISO-8859-1
Content-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable

I just saw John Cassavetes' A Woman Under the Influence. If one wants to se=
e
how technique, technology and professionalism are ultimately briar patches
one should be wary off -that art is created out the struggle with the
limitations of the tools one is using- one should see this movie. This was
the cinematographer Mike Ferris's first ever film. There is no question the
movie (made in 1974) is inspired by French Film Verit=E9. But in this work,
Cassavetes takes it to a completely new dimension. Most French film Verit=
=E9
works were focused on politics or ideas (Godard), referential to other
movies (Truffaut or Godard in Breathless), centered around philosophical or
moral themes (Rohmer). Cassavetes's film deals utterly with human
relationship, within a blue color family. As a result, it has a raw humanit=
y
nothing less than breath taking. "Mistakes" in the film, actors moving out
of the frame, for instance, become incadescent pluses.

Some bonus delights of the film: Gena Rawlands and Peter Falk's radical,
stunningly daring acting; the sweet presences, in everything they do, of
their children.

Even though on the surface seemingly completely different, almost opposites
-Cassavetes' abondon as opposed to the other's minimalist style- the
director Cassavetes' reminds me of most is Robert Bresson. Bresson did not
believe in "actors" and used almost always non-professionals. He believed
truth derived out of a person whole being, and he wanted to shoot, to
capture that. Cassavetes uses both professionals and non, often in the same
scene, forcing the professionals to react to and be captured by the raw
anxiety of their counterparts. The film attempts to reach, in its totality,
to the sense of being. All his directorial method consists of strategies to
achieve that. For instance, he seems to have chose Mike Ferris -who had not
shot a full film before and confesses during the filming he often did not
know how to shoot a scene and was forced to improvise often in a state of
panic- for that purpose.

The film is also I think ambiguous in its attitude towards the life the Gen=
a
Rawlands character is leading; nevertheless, one is completely absorbed by
the reality of her situation.

Ciao,

Murat

i saw this movie in college. i had no idea about any kind of
experimental film. it had a deep effect on me.
i've never forgotten it, though of course i've forgotten many specifics.
and i had no idea at the time that it
was about alcoholism.

Subject:      After 16 years, a new fiction collection by Robert Kelly
MIME-version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="iso-8859-1"
Content-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable

McPherson & Co. is very pleased to announce the publication of Robert =
Kelly's new fiction collection, The Logic of the World and Other =
Fictions, and to offer signed copies to list members at a substantial =
discount until May 1: $16 postpaid (instead of $29). Simply add POETICS =
to your address when ordering at www.mcphersonco.com, or telephone us =
[845-331-5807]. (You can also still order Ted Enslin's new novella, I, =
Benjamin, at the same time for only $5 more.)


The Logic of the World and Other Fictions by Robert Kelly

Adult fiction.

Publication: April 6, 2010

$24.00 clothbound, 244 pages, 5 =BD x 8 =BD", 978-0-929701-89-9.=20

Four previous volumes of Robert Kelly's manifestly original fictions =
have been hailed as "exhilarating.full of signs and wonders" in the New =
York Times Book Review, "sparking, multiform, yet indivisible" in =
American Book Review, and "tantalizing, unsettling" in the Review of =
Contemporary Fiction. Choice rightly points to his "affinities with the =
writings of Borges, Nabokov, Calvino, and Coover." The thirty works in =
this fifth collection of short fictions-the first to appear in sixteen =
years-knowingly trespass into fictional realms of droll lyricism, =
audacious description, studied anachronism, sensual immediacy and subtle =
compassion. In one, a woman waits at a window for the moon to return her =
body; another reveals the triple identity of Don Juan; in still another, =
an itinerant tragedian invents a dangerous form of theatrical =
performance; in the title story a dragon questions a youthful knight's =
errancy, as well as his sanity. Scattered throughout are nine pieces =
known as "sudden fiction," a genre Kelly named, while other tales appear =
in the guises of myths, letters, rituals, and quite frequently dreams. =
"That is the single mystery of sleep," one narrator reminds, "to teach =
us to wake up." The author's agile imagination mines from the thick =
substance of language the numinous qualities buried within it. His =
fictions defy the conventionally plotted short story, and seem to =
conjure narrative from an infinitely recombinant DNA of the psyche. =
After reading The Logic of the World, the reader risks awakening to =
discover a hitherto unexplored territory of the mind.=20

"There is such beauty and mystery and surprise on the path we are =
seductively invited to follow in Robert Kelly's The Logic of the World. =
Do not miss this deeply charmed and haunting foray." - Carole Maso, =
author of AVA=20

NOTE: The title story has been selected for inclusion in The Year's Best =
Science Fiction & Fantasy 2010 (forthcoming).

Robert Kelly was born in 1935 in Brooklyn, and educated at CCNY and =
Columbia, where he studied mediaeval literature and linguistics. His =
first book, Armed Descent, was published in 1961; since then he has =
published over sixty more, including novels, short fiction collections, =
and poetry, receiving many awards. He has been especially interested in =
collaborations with artists (The Garden of Distances, Shame) and other =
poets (Mont Blanc, Unquell the Dawn Now). For over fifty years he has =
been involved with such celebrated journals as Chelsea, Trobar, =
Caterpillar, Alcheringa, and Conjunctions. For almost a half century he =
has taught at Bard College, where he is the Asher B. Edelman Professor =
of Literature and co-directs the Program in Written Arts. He lives in =
the Hudson Valley with his wife, the translator Charlotte Mandell.

Praise for earlier collections of Robert Kelly's fictions

"By means of language, Kelly invades our senses, bringing us to places =
in consciousness where we have never been and where we yearn to go, or =
which we long ago abandoned." - Publishers Weekly=20

"A craftsman who shares our intimate thoughts and knows how to glance =
along with us at the chambers of our imagination.. Profound lessons in =
the art of knowing how the imagination takes hold of the ordinary =
world."-Marilyn Moss, Review of Contemporary Fiction=20

"Essential storytelling, raised to the highest power of the =
imagination."- Norman Weinstein, Los Angeles Reader=20

"Capable of creating entire genres from the modulations of one mood, =
small kingdoms that may be entered at will with concentration the only =
key required."-Marc Laidlaw, American Book Review=20

"A lyrical prose style that mixes eroticism and erudition, a focus on =
the act of perception and on the presentation of sensory stimuli and =
sexual impulses in highly charged images, a sense of shock, wonder and =
utter bewilderment that human consciousness exists at all." -Larry =
McCaffery, New York Times Book Review=20

"What Kelly offers above all, in the tradition of all great poetic =
visionaries, is the way he unleashes the reader's own power of second =
sight-the power we all have.of recognizing the universe in a single =
object or moment."- John Strausbaugh, City Paper=20

"The quality of those dazzling, structured, receding arches seen in old =
abbeys, which entice the mind away into spaces of light, air, and =
stone." - James Polk, Woodstock Times=20

"Mystical glimpses of a rich inner world."- Kirkus Reviews=20

Murat,

Cassavetes' neo-realism began long before W.U.T.I. and it began parallel to
the French new wave-- with "Shadows" (56-59)... and was inspired by "La
Tera Trema," "I Vitelloni," "Umberto D.," and "Bellissima".

He (like those) was not afraid to face reality; to look it straight in the
face.

Godard would later follow.

I have often wondered if there has (or will be) a poetry (or poetics) that
would
approach his achievement, both in style and substance... and improvization.

Any examples?

Till then,
Gerald

I just saw John Cassavetes' A Woman Under the Influence. If one wants to see
how technique, technology and professionalism are ultimately briar patches
one should be wary off -that art is created out the struggle with the
limitations of the tools one is using- one should see this movie. This was
the cinematographer Mike Ferris's first ever film. There is no question the
movie (made in 1974) is inspired by French Film Verité. But in this work,
Cassavetes takes it to a completely new dimension. Most French film Verité
works were focused on politics or ideas (Godard), referential to other
movies (Truffaut or Godard in Breathless), centered around philosophical or
moral themes (Rohmer). Cassavetes's film deals utterly with human
relationship, within a blue color family. As a result, it has a raw humanity
nothing less than breath taking. "Mistakes" in the film, actors moving out
of the frame, for instance, become incadescent pluses.

Some bonus delights of the film: Gena Rawlands and Peter Falk's radical,
stunningly daring acting; the sweet presences, in everything they do, of
their children.

Even though on the surface seemingly completely different, almost opposites
-Cassavetes' abondon as opposed to the other's minimalist style- the
director Cassavetes' reminds me of most is Robert Bresson. Bresson did not
believe in "actors" and used almost always non-professionals. He believed
truth derived out of a person whole being, and he wanted to shoot, to
capture that. Cassavetes uses both professionals and non, often in the same
scene, forcing the professionals to react to and be captured by the raw
anxiety of their counterparts. The film attempts to reach, in its totality,
to the sense of being. All his directorial method consists of strategies to
achieve that. For instance, he seems to have chose Mike Ferris -who had not
shot a full film before and confesses during the filming he often did not
know how to shoot a scene and was forced to improvise often in a state of
panic- for that purpose.

The film is also I think ambiguous in its attitude towards the life the Gena
Rawlands character is leading; nevertheless, one is completely absorbed by
the reality of her situation.

Ciao,

Murat

ISBN13: 978-1-936194-00-1, original paperback $14

A woman=92s life lived as a carefully crafted and rehearsed engagement =20=

What is meant here by long poem? Does serial poetry count?

Muse & Drudge, a collection or a long poem? Either way, relevant to me =
as an example of what play with language can teach.

Song of the Andoumboulou, I'd say is relevant, in its cross-culturality.

Silliman's The Alphabet?

Frank Stanford's The Battlefield Where the Moon Says I Love You seems =
relevant to me as an exploration of the South at a particular moment and =
as an attempt to make something lyrical from a sort of patchwork of =
peoples, from a patchwork segregated culture.

Hejinian's My Life is often used to introduce students to Language =
writing. And is itself a thought-provoking example of how process can =
enter into (intervene in?) life writing.

I feel like I'm giving this question more than it gave me. Unless =
somebody brings more to this stone soup, I'm whistling in the wind.

Gerald,

Well, that's what I am trying to do in my work. That's why I was so taken
with it. You may be right about the dates, but this movie has a roughness i=
n
terms of technique- which nearer I think to what Godard means by "bad
cinema." What are the dates of My Life to Live or Band of Outsiders?
Cassavetes's film was made in 1972.

Maria, A Woman Under the Influence is not about alcoholism though the title
may suggest that. It deals with a woman's eccentric behavior which can be
taken as insanity, but which Cassavets insists it is not, but the result of
the rules of a society which will not let her be fully who she is. Gena
Rawlands, Peter Falk and the kids are something to see.

Many people in the film are family members. Rawland's mother plays her
mother, Cassaveteses's mother plays Falk's mother.

The film has absolutely stunning things in it. For example, a spaghetti
brealfast with about ten people around a table suddenly has two characters
suddenly starting to burst into arias, in one case the person does not know
the words... Wow!

Worth a revisit.

Ciao,

Murat

Everything is as relevant as everything else. Again this implies canon/
genre/conoisseurship. I hear Silliman writes long. Some like short
Wordsworth (he was only 4' 8" - think of it).

Relevant, relevant. Nothing but. What is a short poem?

Dear Poeticists,

Please contact me at p.brown62@gmail.com if you'd like to review
either of these interesting new titles :

A Whistled Bit Of Bop  -   poems  by Ken Bolton
PRICE Austn $27.50 * Vagabond Press

Ken Bolton's A Whistled Bit of Bop begins and ends with poems that
embrace the abstract via collage - working with pre-existing
materials, the initial selection often arbitrary.  Thus 'Double
Trouble' deals with time and timing, art, friendship; closing the
collection, 'Triumvirate' works similarly but in a context that is
political and historical.  Bolton acknowledges parts of a particular
pantheon (F.T. Prince, Tony Towle, Peter Schjeldahl, Ashbery,
Berrigan, John Forbes) in the sequence 'Late Night Reading', which
tips from satire to elegy and out again, while 'Some Photos for Gabe'
takes the form of a letter, wondering at the recipient's life in
London and meditating on two images of domestic life in Australia.  In
a different register, 'Australian Suburban Garden' is spun out of the
'everyday' - art, time, Europe.  Some poems are amusing tours de
force, others are like spells.  "The light changed? Must have."

Dark Bright Doors - poems by Jill Jones
Price Austn $19.95 * Wakefield Press

Jill Jones=92 sixth book, raises questions of the self, as well as the
ecology of place and language. This is Jones at her most versatile and
idiosyncratic, at times a little wild and dark. The poems are
intimate, sharp, self-critical and very present.

All the best from Pam

Gerald,

Well, that's what I am trying to do in my work. That's why I was so take=
n
with it. You may be right about the dates, but this movie has a roughnes=
s in
terms of technique- which nearer I think to what Godard means by "bad
cinema." What are the dates of My Life to Live or Band of Outsiders?
Cassavetes's film was made in 1972.

Maria, A Woman Under the Influence is not about alcoholism though the ti=
tle
may suggest that. It deals with a woman's eccentric behavior which can b=
e
taken as insanity, but which Cassavets insists it is not, but the result=
 of
the rules of a society which will not let her be fully who she is. Gena
Rawlands, Peter Falk and the kids are something to see.

Many people in the film are family members. Rawland's mother plays her
mother, Cassaveteses's mother plays Falk's mother.

The film has absolutely stunning things in it. For example, a spaghetti
brealfast with about ten people around a table suddenly has two characte=
rs
suddenly starting to burst into arias, in one case the person does not k=
now
the words... Wow!

Worth a revisit.

Ciao,

Murat

Like the translations of Un Coup de d=E9s by Marcel Broodthaers, Michael =
Maranda, Guido Molinari, and Michalis Pichler (all of whom emphasize the =
spatial quality of the text itself), my response attempts to expose the =
higher-dimensional motifs found within the original text by =
Mallarm=E9-but unlike my predecessors, my translation uses graphic =
imaging software to add an element of dimensionality to the text by =
reconfiguring and redesigning each page as a non-Euclidean entity. =
Through a series of algorithmic calculations, the computer program =
extrudes a sequence of abstract images based upon the original positions =
of the type on the page. Within the cyberspace continuum, these abstract =
Mallarm=E9an images possess an array of spatial properties that allow =
for each entity to be viewed from all angles in a more volumetric space. =
In the end, the result quite literally showcases a three-dimensional, =
computer-generated translation that physically upholds the spatial =
lattice suggested by the text's structure, while semantically retaining =
the text's abstract, higher-dimensional concepts.

Please mark your calendars for this coming Monday, April 12th @ 2:00 pm for
another Small Press in the Archive lecture: "Nature in N-Dimensions."

 This talk will be held in The Poetry Collection, 420 Capen @ SUNY Buffalo.
This event is free and open to the public.


Small Press in the Archive Lecture Series dedicates itself to the
study of poetry outside the traditional literary historical plot. The
lectures in this series draw on materials in The Poetry Collection, at
SUNY Buffalo in order to explore community/discourse formations, the
status of ephemera and the making of genre, the conditions of literary
production, transatlantic cross-pollinations in and between specific
magazines, the careers of poets, the role of book art, and how the
little magazine functions in the making of the avant-garde.

Hi folks, this is just to let you know that I'll be featuring next thursday, April 15, with Lydia Cortes and George Spencer at Space on White, as part Evie Ivy and Jack Tricarico's new reading series, Poets on White.

The reading will start at 7:00 and there will also be an open mic.  I expect to be reading from my Dr. Cone series, along with a few surprises.

Space on White is a new performance space located at 81 White St. between Broadway and Lafayette a couple of blocks below Canal St.  Any train that stops on Canal St. will you leave you close by, including the R, the N, the M, the J and the 6, and a little farther away the A and the E.

I hope to see you all there.

- Bob

On Newspeak, you may want to check out the wikipedia entry on Basic =
English. BE influenced Orwell. I don't see reference there to Basic =
English's use as part of US Cold War efforts to build a capitalist bloc, =
but it was.

Ogden was interestingly connected to the Heretic's society. There's more =
on this in Damon Franke's Modernist Heresies.

i did not think it was intentional, but Cassevetes didn't care. he knew he
was hiring people with very little experience and that things like that
would happen (occasionally, characters walk off the frame); but he felt
their lack of experience gave the scene an edginess -provided people worked
very hard- and the trade-off was worth it for him. That is what I mean by
"bad cinema" -not intentionally bad -which perhaps the French New Wave
thought, or perhaps not- but bad as a trade-off, a necessary step to achiev=
e
the rawness. It is part -an integral part- of a process. In that way, it is
more akin to mistakes which may occur in a live t.v. comedy show, for
instance, or improvisational jazz.

Interesting, you saw Falk's position within the family as dominance; I
experienced it more as protective of her, suddenly putting down the clamp o=
n
her when certain limits are crossed (for example, in the spaghetti breakfas=
t
scene when she is touching the black guy, urging him to sing, and he is
feeling uncomfortable). He does tell her later that he knew "she didn't mea=
n
anything by it," that it was her affectionate nature; but the guy didn't. I
thought there was love, a lot of affection, a gentleness between the two.
Ciao,

Murat

We are just eight short days away from the biggest poetry and spoken =
word event in New York's Capital Region.  Here is an update on Word Fest =
weekend and who is scheduled to perform.

In celebration of National Poetry Month, Albany Poets is proud to =
present the 2010 Albany Word Fest featuring the poetry, spoken word, and =
music of upstate New York.  This year=92s event will take place on =
Friday, April 16 and Saturday, April 17, 2010 at the UAG Gallery (247 =
Lark Street, Albany, NY).

The 2010 Albany Word Fest will start off on Friday evening with a very =
special Youth Open Mic at 5:00PM.  This is a chance for all of the young =
poets and performers of the area to share their work. All poets who wish =
to participate in this open mic can sign up at the gallery.

At 7:00PM, the 12-Hour Open Mic begins.  After the success of the first =
night long open mic last year, we have decided to do it again. This open =
mic for poetry and spoken word will be held from 7:00PM =96 7:00AM.

Poets who wish to participate in the open mic can sign up online by =
going to the Albany Word Fest website, www.albanywordfest.com until =
April 15.  Poets will also be able to sign up at Professor Java=92s Wide =
Open Mic on Monday, April 12.

Thom Francis, President of Albany Poets explains, =93The first Albany =
Word Fest was held in 2001 in Thatcher Park.  It featured poets from all =
over the upstate area sharing their words all day and into the evening =
in a beautiful outdoor setting.  Through all of the Word Fests since =
then, we have kept the same idea in mind; invite the poets and spoken =
word artists from all over the capital region and beyond to=20
share their words and show that =91poetry lives in Albany=92.=94

This year we have a great list of new poets and poets who have been a =
part of the local literary community for years.  Artists and poets =
already scheduled to perform include Jan Tramontano, Judith Prest, Erica =
Wolfe, Justin Miller, ILLiptical, Cecele Kraus, Poets from the Hudson =
Valley Writers Guild, Todd Fabozzi, John Raymond, Jacqueline Renee Ahl, =
Carol Graser, Barbara Garro, Jason Crane, Tim Verhaegen,=20
Joe Hesch, Matt Galletta, Joanne Trapanese, Nancy Denofio, Cheryl A. =
Rice, Julie Lomoe, Robb Smith, Karin Maag-Tanchak, Adarro Minton, Tess =
Lecuyer, Bob Sharkey, Jacqueline Kirkpatrick, Shannon Lynette, Robert =
Eaton, Shannon Shoemaker, Therese Broderick, R.M. Engelhardt, =
Christopher James, Justin Parrinello, Robert Milby, Christopher "Pinky" =
Gazeent, The Poet Essence, Shaun Baxter, Joe Hollander,=20
Adrianna Delgado, Anthony Bernini, AVERY, Carli McCoy, Dan Wilcox, W.D. =
Clarke, and Don Levy.  The open mic is open to all poets and spoken word =
artists with no style or content restrictions.  Admission is based on =
donation.

On Saturday at 8:00PM, day two of the 2010 Albany Word Fest brings the =
annual Psycho Cluster F*#k to the UAG Gallery featuring poetry, music =
and spoken word from Rebecca Schumejda, Nathan Graziano, The Johnnie =
Bravehearts, Ed Rinaldi, Murrow, Ms. Bliss, Q Diamond, Eloquence, Poetyc =
Vyzyonz, Sunshine, Souljourner Truth, and more.  Admission for this =
event is $5.00.  This event is open to all ages.

Again this year, Albany Poets will be streaming the whole two day event =
live onwww.albanypoets.com for all of those who are not able to make it =
to the UAG Gallery to be in the audience.

The 2010 Albany Word Fest is sponsored by Albany Poets, Tess=92 Lark =
Tavern, UAG Gallery, and the very generous donations of supporters of =
the arts in upstate New York.

I'm very happy to say that "Into Thick Hair", a chapbook by Ian
Davidson, is now available from Wild Honey Press.

Phrases are knitted, unpicked, reknitted, in a sequence pitting tension
against gravity, plain against purl, lovingly crafted and full of holes
that the sun shines through.

Price zero, though you are welcome to make a donation to a charity of
your choice.

If you'd like a copy please email me or drop me a line at Randolph
Healy, 16a Ballyman Road, Bray, County Wicklow, Ireland.

With new interest in poetry as a performative art, and with prewar
experiments much in mind, the young poets of postwar America infused the
stage with the rhythms and shocks of their poetry. From the
multidisciplinary nexus of Black Mountain, to the Harvard-based
Cambridge Poets Theatre, to the West Coast Beats and San Francisco
Renaissance, these energies manifested themselves all at once, and
through the decades have continued to grow and mutate, innovating a form
of writing that defies boundaries of genre. /THE KENNING ANTHOLOGY OF
POETS THEATER: 1945-1985/ documents the emergence, growth, and varied
fortunes of the form over decades of American literary history, with a
focus on key regional movements. The largest and most comprehensive
anthology of its kind yet assembled, the volume collects classics of
poets theater as well as rarities long out of print and texts from
unpublished manuscripts and archives. It will be an indispensable
reference for students of postwar American poetry and avant-garde theater.

Among the poets featured in/ THE KENNING ANTHOLOGY OF POETS THEATER/ are
Charles Olson, John Ashbery, Frank O'Hara, Russell Atkins, Gregory
Corso, Helen Adam, Michael McClure, James Broughton, Kenneth Koch,
Jackson Mac Low, Lorenzo Thomas, Anne Waldman, ruth weiss, Ron Padgett,
Hannah Weiner, Lew Welch, Sonia Sanchez, Joe Brainard, Bruce Andrews,
Keith Waldrop, Rosmarie Waldrop, Bob Holman and Bob Rosenthal, Steve
Benson, Ted Greenwald, Carla Harryman, Ntozake Shange, Bob Perelman, Kit
Robinson, Robert Grenier, Alan Bernheimer, Charles Bernstein, Stephen
Rodefer, Fiona Templeton, Kenward Elmslie, and Leslie Scalapino. Also
included are previously unpublished plays by Jack Spicer, V.R. "Bunny"
Lang, James Schuyler, Robert Duncan, Madeline Gleason, Diane di Prima,
Barbara Guest, James Keilty, Theresa Hak Kyung Cha, Johanna Drucker, and
Nada Gordon. The editors provide informative and provocative prefatory
matter, including extensive notes on each play, as well as several that
fall within the purview of the book but, for one reason or another, were
omitted, as with Pedro Pietri's /The Masses Are Asses/ or Jessica
Hagedorn's/ Tenement Lover/. Rounding out the book are contemporary
classics: LeRoi Jones/Amiri Baraka's /Dutchman /and Kathy Acker's /The
Birth of the Poet/.

, thanks for mentioning it (although forget now what the original reason wa=

 is also damned awkwardly masculine, unable very well to be gentle. Am thin=
king for example about the welcome-back party for Rowlands' character. All =
she needed was space and for everyone to get out but Falk insists on having=
 'fun', and 'normal conversation'. Think it was an endearing inability to h=
andle the situation, but not one that is helping his wife. =0A=0AAnother in=
teresting moment is when she asks him if he loves her and he only mumbles. =
Is that because he loves her so much he can't speak or is it because he is =
not sure anymore because of the whole history, or maybe because he is no lo=

I think "mistakes" in Cassevetes's films arise out of the objective
conditions he creates on the set. Giving the job of the cinematographer to =
a
novice is one of them. Another was the fact that people were never sure whe=
n
a scene was being rehearsed or shot. Cathevetes never answered questions
about a character's motivation. He told the actor, including Gena his wife
in actual life, to find for himself or herself. People say there was always
a sense of giddy anxiety on the set. The actors remained on the edge. It is
out of these conditions that both "mistakes" and raw emotions, the sense
that things were occurring then, in real time, happened; it was not due to =
a
decision to be "improvisatory" or or "to make mistakes," as is often assume=
d
today.

To me, it is fascinating to compare the kind of acting Cassavetes required
to method acting. There is no delving "inside oneself," no delving into
memory, which Cassavetes's method implies are illusions, a kind of
solipsism, that if you "feel" something, others will feel it to. For him, i=
t
seems to me, "acting" was reacting to the moment, which is a different kind
of acting -acting closer to being, "of the moment," "at the moment."

Ciao,

Murat

i did not think it was intentional, but Cassevetes didn't care. he knew =
he
was hiring people with very little experience and that things like that
would happen (occasionally, characters walk off the frame); but he felt
their lack of experience gave the scene an edginess -provided people wor=
ked
very hard- and the trade-off was worth it for him. That is what I mean b=
y
"bad cinema" -not intentionally bad -which perhaps the French New Wave
thought, or perhaps not- but bad as a trade-off, a necessary step to ach=
ieve
the rawness. It is part -an integral part- of a process. In that way, it=
 is
more akin to mistakes which may occur in a live t.v. comedy show, for
instance, or improvisational jazz.

Interesting, you saw Falk's position within the family as dominance; I
experienced it more as protective of her, suddenly putting down the clam=
p on
her when certain limits are crossed (for example, in the spaghetti break=
fast
scene when she is touching the black guy, urging him to sing, and he is
feeling uncomfortable). He does tell her later that he knew "she didn't =
mean
anything by it," that it was her affectionate nature; but the guy didn't=
. I
thought there was love, a lot of affection, a gentleness between the two=
.

Dear Murat

I saw this film again a few months ago on turner cable--and first saw it
when it came out--
what you write re Bresson and Cassavetes is interesting; however i think
that though it may appear that the two are "aiming" so to speak for the sam=
e
effect-the methods are very different. Cassavetes wants to create an
ambiance of spontaneity out of which a rough truth will rawly emerge.  In
many of his works, he has a carefully assembled ensemble cast, who through
working together have learned to improvise off of each other. Cassavetes,
himself a fine actor, wants to give room to the actor=97Bresson wants, in
effect, to abolish the actor.

Bresson worked for a long time with strictly non-actors. Beginning with suc=
h
a minimum of experience, Bresson seeks, not to =93create an actor=94 but ra=
ther
to as much as possible keep =93acting=94 from happening.   Bresson  would
obsessively shoot even a simple scene, one =93actor=94 only, with a few lin=
es of
dialogue sometimes as many as 80 times--what he wanted to do with his actor=
s
was achieve what in the French language is regarded as an ideal--a perfect
monotone. The lack of inflexion in speech is just as important as the lack
of inflexion, of drama, in the physicality of the actors.  This
neutralityof effect was also a dream
of Flaubert=92s--the wish to create a perfectly "grey" prose at one point i=
n
his writing.  In a sense, this is also an ideal in the theater of
Racine, a purity,
a  classical flatness of affect, out of which arises, for the Jansenist
Bresson, the "moment of Grace." In keeping with this classicism and the
extremes of the Jansenist concept of  purity--that is, purity of language,
action, camera angle, lighting--everything toned down to rigorously prepare
for and create a mystical sense of a revelation, a moment of Grace which
arises from the most minimal events in the "drama"--which can be, all the
while, over al quite "dramatic" and often violent.
The rigor of Bresson's is a spiritual rigor, concerned with, among others, =
 the
very fundamental question: how does one show the moment of Grace as it
occurs?  The rigor of the method is linked to the trails through which the
characters pass--it reaches its apotheosis in the incredible film Au Hasard
Balthazar, in which the main character is a donkey--it is to the donkey tha=
t
the moment of Grace happens. The human characters are too =93fallen=94 to a=
ttain
this purity=97

IN a sense, in many of Bresson=92s films the tension is generated by the fo=
cus
on the exteriority, the surface, of the characters=97and this exteriority i=
s
to give away as few clues as possible to the inner life of the character as
an individual=97again a spiritual purification of =93personality,=94 as act=
ion
making possible the flooding of inner light which is the Moment of Grace.

A few years ago I saw a mini-retrospective of Bresson=92s works=97I had see=
n
them al before=97but this time they became more sharply etched in mind than
all but a few films I have seen since.

there is a fascinating documentary on the making of Bresson=92s film
Pickpocket, in which the documentary film maker "catches up with" the actor=
s
some decades later--how, once having "starred" in a film did these
previously non-actors--whom Bresson in a sense forbids to "act deal with
this discovery of themselves, not only by others, but by themselves?
Before he became a screen writer and later director, Paul Schrader wrote a
very interesting book called Transcendental Cinema: Ozu, Bresson, Dreyer.
Schrader himself was brought up in a fundamental religious family and did
not see a film until he was 18 years old.  The influence of
fundamentalismcan be seen in a number
of his films as both writer and director, perhaps most specifically in
Scorcese's Taxi Driver, in which the character of Travis Bickle, played by
Robert de Niro, is a ne example of the American fundamentalist conception o=
f
"regeneration through violence."  Travis is seen preparing himself,
purifying himself, before attempting to carry out his plan, first, foiled,
to murder a political candidate and second, to kill the pimp and his
colleagues who are exploiting the child prostitute played by Jody Foster.
The film is fascinating in many scenes to watch how Schrader=92s
fundamentalism is played off of Scorcese's Catholicism, which becomes most
apparent in another film of violence, Raging Bull, in which the characterfi=
nds
regeneration as it were, through language.  Travis keeps a diary and
attempts to chart his struggle, his inward search and his development of a
daily regime of physical discipline to turn him into a political, then a
religious, compassionate, assassin.

(Much of the film was loosely based on the story of Arthur Bremer and his
Diaries, which were buried on the Lake Bluffs here in Milwaukee near where =
I
work outdoors a lot on my rubBEings etc.  Bremer was last year released fro=
m
prison=97he had originally stalked Richard Nixon with intent to assassinate
him during the 1972 Presidential election; Nixon being too well guarded,
Bremer turned his attention and gun towards former Alabama Governor George
Wallace, running as Third Party Candidate.  Wallace was permanently
paralyzed from the waist down. Bremer=92s Diaries were published after thei=
r
exhumation, and have remained out of print ever since. At one point in
prison, Arthur Bremer was housed in the same units that the notorious Ed
Gein was.



A Woman Under the Influence very much struck me in the sense of awkwardness
it conveyed.  I think what really moved me most in the film was the sense o=
f
the family=92s love and acceptance of each other. In a way, the Gena Rowlan=
ds
character is in a state of grace which others can feel yet not
understand.  Failing
to understand, they offer love, however clumsily, to make a safe place in
the world for a person they sense may be out on an edge they can not see or
imagine for themselves, for in protecting her, they find in a sense that sh=
e
is protecting them from an/the unknown.  The wife/mother becomes a kind of
=93Holy figure=94 as it were, in the way in which the =93Holy Fool=94 has b=
een
historically in a great many cultures.  One of the exceptional aspects of
the film, for me, was that the family sense the mystery an distance at time=
s
of the Gena character=97sense, in an uncanny way, the kind of loneliness sh=
e
might endure if it were not for the love they give her. There are moments o=
f
=93grace=94 as it were for this character in which she is being
observed=97continually observed=97which can be as hard on one as being
continually ignored=97and, knowing this, stil finds a way in which to marve=
l
at at what she alone is seeing, a sense of privacy in the midst of al this
surrounding wave of protective love, which might otherwise be almost
stifling.  But then, thisis but one of many ways one might think of the
film=97one might see it again and find something completely different . .

So good to see someone whose work you value get one of these things:

Poetry: "Versed," by Rae Armantrout (Wesleyan University Press), a book striking for its wit and linguistic inventiveness, offering poems that
are often little thought-bombs detonating in the mind long after the
first reading. Finalists: "Tryst," by Angie Estes (Oberlin College
Press), a collection of poems remarkable for its variety of subjects,
array of genres and nimble use of language, and "Inseminating the
Elephant," by Lucia Perillo (Copper Canyon Press), a collection of
poems, often laced with humor, that examine popular culture, the limits
of the human body and the tragicomic aspects of everyday experience.

Hi All,

I'm cataloging, in my head at the moment, contemporary poets I've read
and/or met who also play/sing/rap/spin in bands or solo, or at least
did for a period of time in the past. I'm not coming up with a whole
lot of names, but I have this hunch that there is a lot of us,
although we don't necessarily mention our double lives in our bio
blurbs.

If you are or know a poet who is/was also a musician in any shape or
form, please respond here or e-mail me at szabic2@gmail.com. I don't
have a clear goal in mind as to why I'm cataloging this phenomenon.
But there might be an event in the future.

Thanks,

Snezana

Dear David,

I completely agree with (and greatful for) your analysis of Bresson's films=
,
that through minimalism (of outward act and intonation) his films are tryin=
g
to reach, to project a moment of grace -a zero moment. That moment of grace
arrived at by Balthazar at its moment of death also appears in a poem of
mine from *The Structure of Escape:

Au hazard*

Dear David,

I completely agree with (and greatful for) your analysis of Bresson's films=
,
that through minimalism (of outward act and intonation) his films are tryin=
g
to reach, to project a moment of grace -a zero moment. That moment of grace
arrived at by Balthazar at its moment of death also appears in a poem of
mine from *The Structure of Escape:

"    au hazard* *balthazar*

how can you let a donkey die for your film. in a final gesture, a wandering
lamb from nowhere, sniffing its feet?

is it because it can not act?"

The theme of the whole poem *The Structure of Escape* are inspired by
Bresson's *A Prisoner Escaped*. *The Spiritual Life of Replicants* is
replete with quotes from *The Art of the Cinematographer*, pointing to
parallels between the "mechanical" actions of the robots and the ideal of
"non-acting" Bresson pursues.

I experienced A Woman Under the Influence very much like you did, that the
love Gena Rowlands and Peter Falk have for each other, the way they protect
their children (do you remember Falk repeatedly carrying one of the kids up
the stairs to prevent her(?) from seeing the mother "distracted?) are at th=
e
sweet heart of this movie. I had not thought of it, but yes, the Gena
character can be best seen as a "holy fool," with her own kind of grace,
making people both unconfortable swith and drawn to her.

It is very insightful of you to see that the Rowlands/Falk characters are
being "continuously observed." Finally, isn't cinema the art of continually
observing, seeing. In that respect, isn't the camera itself implicitly
projecting the panopticon within which the two characters are contunously
living? As you notice, despite that, they are able to create their own
private world. The two big scenes in the movie -the spaghetti brealfast
scene (which I love) and Rawlands return from the asylum- end up first Falk
kicking everyone out of the house, despite the fact that in both cases he
himself had created the crowded condition.

Do you remember that eerie, mysterious long shot in which the couple is see=
n
in bed from the other side of the french doors, a very dim light half
illuminating their movements?

I agree with you about the cultural, stylistic (to me relatively
superficial) distinctions you see between Bresson and Cassavetes' film. Wha=
t
unites them is that both of them are after a moment of "being." Bresson, as
you say, as a Jansenist and classicist, sees the moment of purity (grace)
achieved through a "chaste" withdrawal from visible action. Cassavetes sees
it in the flotsam and jetsam of daily life, the gore of its messiness (a
non-classical, very American value). In my view, Cassavetes' camera in Unde=
r
the Influence is as pure as Bresson's. They are French and American version=
s
of moments of "grace" as moments of "being." That's why "non-acting" is so
important to Bresson, as in his own version of danger-tinged spontaneity is
important to Cassavetes.

Though I am aware of Schrader's interest in Bresson, I think the
similarities between their works are superficial. Unless I am mistaken,
death is Bresson movies alway occurs naturally, through suffering (for
instance, with Balthazar and the village curate). Even A Prisoner Escaped
has no death in it (murders occur in silence, off the camera, off the
frame). I think a physically violent death, a la Taxi Driver, would be
anathema to Bresson, exactly the kind of excess -acting out- his sensibilit=
y
is against. The moments of grace in Woman Under the Influence are gentle an=
d
occur in private, for instance, after the breakfast guests are kicked out,
when Falk tells Rowlands "I know you mean nothing by it," or, at her return
from the asylum, when everyone has left and she returns to her true state
(herself) and the children gather around their parents (like the sheep
gathering around Balthazar's expiring body...)

Ciao,

Murat

This piece was written for Todd Swift's blog Eyewear. It concerns Nirvana, the rock band that showed up in 1991 and established Alternative Rock as the dominant trend in popular music. Many of the lessons derived from this piece apply also to poetry:

Hi, Nana,

I'm in a group called low road with sax player Noah Preminger & keyboard
player Eric Lane. They do jazz settings of my poems & I read them.


Thanks for asking.

With deep sadness I have to report that our friend of decades Franz
Kamin died in a car crash with another composer friend James Brody on
Sunday; Brody, Franz's old close friend, was driving him to the
country when the unexplained accident occurred. Franz was in my view
a great artist--visionary composer, poet, writer of unexampled prose,
extraordinary pianist and organizer of powerful events, inspiration
and guide to many many people--far too much to say now--and I will
say more later when the impact of this lets me. For many of us Franz
was a cornerstone of a big imaginal building we do everything in our
work to live inside of.

Hi Nana,

I'm part of a new music group called The Crank Ensemble (http://www.crankensemble.com/).  I'm not in charge or anything, I just turn a crank.  If folks would like to see us, and are in the bay area, come visit us at the Makers Fair May 22-23.

Best,

Hi All,

I'm cataloging, in my head at the moment, contemporary poets I've read
and/or met who also play/sing/rap/spin in bands or solo, or at least
did for a period of time in the past. I'm not coming up with a whole
lot of names, but I have this hunch that there is a lot of us,
although we don't necessarily mention our double lives in our bio
blurbs.

If you are or know a poet who is/was also a musician in any shape or
form, please respond here or e-mail me at szabic2@gmail.com. I don't
have a clear goal in mind as to why I'm cataloging this phenomenon.
But there might be an event in the future.

Just had to write in to congratulate, Rae, and don't know how to get a hold
of her; to say David Bromige was a Huge fan of Rae's, and often quoted her
line, " the smallest distance inexhaustible".  ( Hope I got it right.)  He

Subject: Rae's Pulitzer

So good to see someone whose work you value get one of these things:

Poetry: "Versed," by Rae Armantrout (Wesleyan University Press), a book
striking for its wit and linguistic inventiveness, offering poems that
are often little thought-bombs detonating in the mind long after the
first reading. Finalists: "Tryst," by Angie Estes (Oberlin College
Press), a collection of poems remarkable for its variety of subjects,
array of genres and nimble use of language, and "Inseminating the
Elephant," by Lucia Perillo (Copper Canyon Press), a collection of
poems, often laced with humor, that examine popular culture, the limits
of the human body and the tragicomic aspects of everyday experience.

Amazing sadness. I'll always recall when I first read him--the
experience was endlessly edifying--& I never stopped.

Scrbble Death, particularly, stands out as an enduring & continually
impressive achievement.

Best wishes to all.

I do both, record and play out a fair amount, various instruments and
techniques. It's not dabbling - it takes far too much practice.

We (mIEKAL aND + Elizabeth Was) had an art / noise / performance band
that changed it's name every year for about 15-20 years.  The majority
of the audio was improvised & ranged from jazz improv to industrial
noise depending on the gig. We made a lot of invented instruments out
of things like gourds (which we grew) to playing a huge array of
winds, percussion,strings, computers & homemade electronics.  As well
the ensemble ranged from duo to settings such as a piece called Post
Punk Martian Big Band where we got a lot of local punk kids to play on
instruments they had never played before.  Text, film projects, live
painting, movement, costumes were always part of our shows.  When
Elizabeth died in 2004 I stopped playing live music altogether & have
focussed on audio collage & microsound using a Mac workstation.

Here's a list of partial list of our names:

Two Dogs in Paris
Twa Digs in Paris
Qwa Digs under Paris's
Qwa Digs Never Parish
Aquatics Ever Tarnish
Semantics Could Vanish
Floating Concrete Octopus
Wisconsin Conservatory of Noise
The Driftless Ensemble of Botanical Apparitions

Hope this helps.

Subject:      Pulitzer for Hank Williams!!!
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=ISO-8859-1

One of US America's greatest songwriters was awarded posthumously with the
Lifetime Achievement Award. Few American writers in any genre have expressed
loneliness and "lonesomeness" with the terse, harsh lyricism of Hank
Williams.
Hank Williams used the simplest words to express the most complex human
emotions with a directness that knew no boundaries of genre--his songs have
been covered by countless musicians worldwide, and he's inspired and
continues to inspire writers not only of songs but of poetry, fiction and
non-fiction as well.  One of the best deserving Pulitzers ever awarded!
Combine Robert Johnson and Hank Williams and you have --the basis of not
only rock'n' roll but tens of thousands of singers-songwriters and
musicians, poets, writers of al genres--given material that is still being
mined--a deep and rich inheritance, a bed rock and soil for endless growth--

> I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry"

Hear that lonesome whippoorwill,
He sounds too blue to fly.
The midnight train is whining low,
I'm so lonesome I could cry.
I've never seen a night so long
When time goes crawling by.
The moon just went behind a cloud
To hide its face and cry.

Did you ever see a robin weep,
When leaves began to die?
That means he's lost the will to live,
I'm so lonesome I could cry.

The silence of a falling star
Lights up a purple sky.
And as I wonder where you are
I'm so lonesome I could cry.

I saw him play Ives's Concord Sonatas at a private house concert a few
years ago. Sublime. A really wonderful experience.
Very sad, so very sad.

I have been a musician on and off for roughly 50 years.  I still perform
live occasionally and record the odd song now and then.  Currently I'm
trying to figure out what to do with some of Alan Sondheim's crystal radio
recordings.

With new interest in poetry as a performative art, and with prewar
experiments much in mind, the young poets of postwar America infused the
stage with the rhythms and shocks of their poetry. These energies
manifested themselves all at once, and through the decades have
continued to grow and mutate, innovating a form of writing that defies
boundaries of genre. THE KENNING ANTHOLOGY OF POETS THEATER: 1945-1985
documents the emergence, growth, and varied fortunes of the form over
decades of American literary history, with a focus on key regional
movements. The largest and most comprehensive anthology of its kind yet
assembled, the volume collects classics, long out of print rarities and
texts from unpublished manuscripts. Copiously annotated, it will be an
indispensable reference for students of postwar American poetry and
avant garde theater. Included are works by Jack Spicer, John Ashbery,
Michael McClure, Diane di Prima, Amiri Baraka, Hannah Weiner, Barbara
Guest, Sonia Sanchez, Theresa Hak Kyung Cha, Carla Harryman, Charles
Bernstein, Leslie Scalapino, Kathy Acker, and many others. A unique
feature of the book is its editors' notes even on works omitted but
falling within the anthology's purview, including Pedro Pietri's The
Masses Are Asses and Jessica Hagedorn's Tenement Lover. Erudite yet
highly readable, the plays and prefatory matter offer a highly
entertaining glimpse of the ways in which poets have used the theater to
widen their audience, develop new techniques, or negotiate their
aesthetic community's precepts and desires. In the process, some of the
most mature and progressive work within and about the theater was
produced, and is at last gathered in one place.

The press is working on three new titles this summer: AMBIENT PARKING
LOT, by Pamela Lu; SOME MATH, by Bill Luoma; and a chapbook by Tan Lin.
Thanks for spreading the word!

Hi All,

I'm cataloging, in my head at the moment, contemporary poets I've read
and/or met who also play/sing/rap/spin in bands or solo, or at least
did for a period of time in the past. I'm not coming up with a whole
lot of names, but I have this hunch that there is a lot of us,
although we don't necessarily mention our double lives in our bio
blurbs.

If you are or know a poet who is/was also a musician in any shape or
form, please respond here or e-mail me at szabic2@gmail.com. I don't
have a clear goal in mind as to why I'm cataloging this phenomenon.
But there might be an event in the future.

Thanks,

Snezana

The last sardine cannery in the US closes on Friday.  Please consider
submitting a sarding song (or herring hymn) to Gary Lawless=B9s and Karin
Spitfire=B9s blog:=20

SARDINES

is a yellow, red, orange, black & green
word. I got sardines at the dollar store
where everything except sardines is more
than a dollar, for sixty cents, as they should be
my father used to take sardine sandwiches to work
perhaps therefore, I love sardines. when people
used to talk about the subway, they'd say:
we were packed like sardines which sends a message:
small, cheap, tightly packed, anchovies for the poor
or you too can be both colorful & inexpensive as
a really snappy, tiny bright blue convertible
in which you can enjoy the good things about
feeling like a sardine but maybe you'd rather
be a striped bass or be a manatee with me
or a grand whale, forgetful of nothing even
being so big, the ocean's CEO, you'll take home
a giant amount of cash when the ocean goes bust
so you can share it even with the downtrodden
sardines who get packed in cans in Thailand
& shipped to the family dollar store for Bernadette

Subject:      12 or 20 (small press) questions (third series):

Conducted by rob mclennan and Lisa Pasold, this new series of 12 or 20
questions (originally based on mclennans own first and second series of
interviews with writers) is a response to a conversation between mclennan
(founder/coordinator of the ottawa small press book fair) and Pasold
(current co-coordinator of the Toronto Small Press Fair) after the fall
2009 edition of the Toronto fair, held at the Gladstone Hotel. Over
drinks, the two colluded to work a series of interviews with purveyors of
small and micro-press, whether chapbook or book publishers, or
editors/publishers of magazines, journals or zines. Much thanks to the
Gladstone Hotel, who originally provided drinks and the opportunity, and
Open Book Toronto, where a number of these pieces have been featured.

Hillary Juster & Gregory Laynor

Hillary Juster has black hair and soon a BA in interdisciplinary studies
from NYU as well. She won 1st place in a poetry competition in 8th grade,
won the Lamont Younger Poet's Prize at 15, but hasn't won much since. As a
compliment to reading poetry, she likes to engage members of audience with
sculpture, lighting, photography, and touching. In her spare time, she edit=
s
the old college lit mag, The Minetta Review, or is about to do something
pretty impressive. Check out her work in the forthcoming The Physical Poets
Home Library.

Gregory Laynor has been teaching & studying at Temple University in
Philadelphia. His reading of Gertrude Stein's The Making of Americans
appears on UbuWeb. He does a blog at academicpoetry.com. He is co-editing
for Chax Press the collected writings of the Philadelphia poet Gil Ott.

THE SALT OF STRUCTURE: A Celebration of Miron Bia=B3oszewski & Launch of
Aufgabe Magazine #9

The Salt of Structure: A Celebration of Miron Bia=B3oszewski will comprise
readings from Bia=B3oszewski's poems, prose, a performance of several of his
cabaret pieces, as well as readings from the new issue of Aufgabe which
features Polish poetry & poetics in translation. The work will be presented
by American poets Peter Gizzi, Lisa Jarnot, Joan Retallack, Corina Copp,
Paolo Javier, and Eugene Ostashevsky; Edwin Frank, Editor of the NYRB
Classics Series; and Polish poet Ewa Chru=B6ciel, who is featured in the
Aufgabe issue and will also read from her own poetry. The evening will be
introduced by Harvard professor Joanna Ni=BFy=F1ska. There will be a
post-reading reception.

Miron Bia=B3oszewski (1922-1983) was one of Poland's great postwar poets but
is so far little known in English. At once playful, meditative, provocative=
,
perplexing, and evasive, his work is extraordinarily difficult to translate=
.
Aside from a handful of poems published in Mi=B3osz's anthology Postwar Polis=
h
Poetry, only one slim volume of Bia=B3oszewski's verse has so far appeared in
English; but both it and the acclaimed, unconventional Memoir of the Warsaw
Uprising remain long out of print. This situation is hopefully changing. In
a recent survey of translation desiderata conducted by The Quarterly
Conversation, poet and Words without Borders editor Ilya Kaminsky replied:
"Poems of Miron Bia=B3oszewski is the book I hope to one day hold in my
hands." And the new (#9) issue of the Brooklyn-based literary journal
Aufgabe, which features a special section on Polish poetry and poetics
edited by Mark Tardi, is a big step in that direction. The portfolio
presents an ample selection of new translations of Bia=B3oszewski's work as
well as several previously published poems, along with a critical essay by
critic Kacper Bartczak and work by younger Polish poets, including Ewa
Chru=B6ciel, who might be considered inheritors of the Bia=B3oszewskian
tradition of innovative, experimental poetry.

--------------------------------------------


June 2008: Refocussed List Policy
In line with our editorial focus, we do not automatically post
submissions but select those we think are most useful for sustaining
this online community. We appreciate all submissions, but will be more
selective in what we choose to post. Queries for contact info,
messages intended for just a few subscribers, messages that are not on
topic, "flame" messages, and free-standing personal poems or journal
entries will, in general, not be forwarded to the list.

1. Posting to the List

Our aim is to support, inform, and extend those directions in poetry
that are committed to innovations, renovations, and investigations of
form and/or/as content, to the questioning of received forms and
styles, and to the creation of the otherwise unimagined, untried,
unexpected, improbable, and impossible. While we recognize that other
lists may sponsor other possibilities for exchange, we request that
those participating in this forum keep in mind the specialized and
focused nature of this project and respect our decision to operate a
moderated list. The Poetics List exists to support and encourage
divergent points of view on innovative forms of modern and
contemporary poetry and poetics, and we are committed to doing what is
necessary to preserve this space for such dialog.

The Poetics List is a moderated list. Posts are limited to list
subscribers. All messages are reviewed by the editors in keeping with
the goals of the list as articulated in this Welcome Message. The
listserv is intended to be a productive communal space for discussion
and announcements; as such, subscribers who do not follow listserv
policy will be removed from the subscription roll.

Please note that this list is primarily concerned with discussions of
poetry and poetics. We strongly encourage subscribers to post
information, including web links, relating to publications (print and
internet), reading series, and blogs that they have coordinated,
edited or published, or in which they appear. Such announcements
constitute a core function of this list. Brief reviews of poetry
events and publications (print or digital) are always welcome.

The Poetics List is not a forum for a general discussion of poetry or
for the exchange of poems. Queres for contact info, messages intended
for just a few subscribers, "flame" messages, and free-standing
personal poems or journal entries will, in general, not be forwarded
to the list.

Also, please note that the Poetics List is not a "chat" list and we
discourage the posting of  very short messages intended for only a few
subscribers. Personal queries and off-topic submissions will not be
posted.

Send messages directly to the list address: poetics@listserv.buffalo.edu.


2. About the Poetics List

Above the world-weary horizons
New obstacles for exchange arise
Or unfold,
O ye postmasters!

With the preceding epigraph, the Poetics Listserv was founded by
Charles Bernstein in late 1993. Now in its fourth incarnation, the
list has over 1500 subscribers worldwide. We also have a substantial
number of nonsubscribing readers, who access the list through our web
site (see archive URL above).

Due to the high number of subscribers, we no longer maintain the open
format with which the list began (at under 100 subscribers).

Please also note that this is a not a general interest poetry list and
information about this list should not be posted to directories of
poetry lists. The idea is to keep the list membership to those with
specific engagement related to the list's stated orientation.

In addition to being archived through the EPC and at the UB Listerv
archive, some posts to Poetics (especially reviews, obituary notices,
announcements, etc.) may also become part of specific EPC subject
areas.

Note also that Roof Books published Joel Kuszai's edited collection of
the Poetics List; this is available from ROOF and also online at the
EPC.

3. Subscriptions

*For all subscription requests go to
http://listserv.acsu.buffalo.edu/archives/poetics.html.

*To subscribe for the first time click on "Subscribe (join) a List."
Immediately following your subscription to the poetics listserv we ask
that you email us at poetics.list --at -- gmail.com, subject-line
"registration," with your full name, street address, email address,
and telephone number. Failure to register at the time of subscription
will result in automatic deletion from the subscription roll.

*To manage your subscription (for descriptions of the different
subscription options please see section 3), click on "Subscriber's
Corner."

Subscriptions to the Poetics List are free of charge, but formal
registration is required. All other questions about subscriptions,
whether about an individual subscription or subscription policy,
should be addressed to this same administrative address.

PLEASE NOTE: All subscription-related information and correspondence
remains absolutely confidential.

All posts to the list must provide your full real name, as registered.
If there is any discrepancy between your full name as it appears in
the "from" line of the message header, please sign your post at the
bottom. Subscribers who do not include their full name with each post
will be unsubscribed from the list.

The most frequent problem with subscriptions is bounced messages. If
your system is often down or if you have a low disk quota, Poetics
messages may get bounced, which will result in your subscription being
automatically terminated by the Listserv program and the automatically
generated message telling you that this has occurred will also likely
bounce. If this happens, you may re-subscribe to the list by the same
process described above. One remedy to avoid this happening in the
future: set your list options to "no-mail" and read the list on the
web.

4. Subscription Options

We encourage you to alter your subscription options via the link on
the right side of the screen at
http://listserv.acsu.buffalo.edu/archives/poetics.html. If you would
prefer not to use the web-interface, you may also email
<listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu> the following commands:

*to subscribe to the Poetics listserv send
listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu this one-line message with no "subject":
sub poetics [your Firstname and Lastname]

*RECOMMENDED: if you wish to read the list on our web interface and
not receive any messages sent directly, while remaining subscribed to
the list and so eligible to send us posts, send this one-line message
to <listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu> with no "subject": set poetics
nomail. Note: this option is also useful for temporary suspension of
email service.

*to reactivate Poetics e-mail send <listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu>
this one-line message with no "subject": set poetics mail

* to receive the list in digest form (you will receive the day's
individual posts in one email sent just after midnight EST), send
<listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu> this one-line message with no
"subject": set poetics digest

*to receive posts in the default option (you will receive individual
postings immediately), send <listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu> this one-
line message with no "subject": set poetics nodigest

* to receive the list in index form (you will receive a list, without
the text of the posts, of the subjects discussed each day along with
the author's name and address and the number of lines it comprises;
you can also choose to have the index sent to you in either plain text
or in HTML format with hyperlinks), send
<listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu> this one-line message with no
"subject": set poetics nohtml index --or-- set poetics html index

PLEASE NOTE: do not leave your Poetics subscription in default or
digest mode if you are going to be away for any extended period of
time. Your account may become flooded and you may lose Poetics
messages as well as other important mail. In such cases, switch your
subscription to "nomail" as recommended above.

5. To Unsubscribe

To unsubscribe (or change any of your subscription options), again, we
strongly encourage you to go to the right-hand side of the screen at
http://listserv.acsu.buffalo.edu/archives/poetics.html You may also
may unsubscribe by sending a one-line email to
<listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu> with no "subject": unsub poetics

If you are having difficulty unsubscribing, please note: sometimes
your e-mail address may be changed slightly by your system
administrator. If this happens you will not be able to send messages
to Poetics or to unsubscribe, although you will continue to receive
mail from the Poetics List. To avoid this problem, unsub using your
old address, then resubscribe with your new email address.

6. Cautions

In moderating this list, the editors must consider sometimes competing
interests. The basis for our decisions, however, rests with our
collective judgment about the kind of space we want for the list.

All posts not only go out to list subscribers but also become a public
part of the list archive on the web. Note that posting to the list is
a form of publication and that by sending your message to the list you
formally consent to such web publication. Posts are currently being
indexed by search engines such as Google. It is not possible for us to
remove posts from the list archive or to control search engine
indexing of these posts.

For reasons of basic security, we do not allow pseudonymous
subscriptions. All messages intended for the Poetics List should be
sent in Text-Only format, without attachments. We do not accept
HTML-formatted messages or attached files. As a general rule, keep
individual posts to 1,000 words or less.

Please do not publish list postings without the express permission of
the author. Posting on the list is a form of publication. Copyright
for all material posted on Poetics remains with the author; material
from this list and its archive may not be reproduced without the
author's permission, beyond the standard rights accorded by "fair use"
of published materials.

All material on the Poetics List remains the property of the authors;
before you reproduce this material, in whole or in part, we ask that
you get permission (by email is fine) from the authors. If they give
permission, then we ask only that you say that the post or posts
appeared originally on the Poetics List
(http://epc.buffalo.edu/poetics/welcome.html) on [give date and say:]
Used by permission of the author.

Note: Private correspondence via email and letters are always =A9 the
author and may not be reproduced in whole or in part without the
written permission of the author. As a general rule, we will not
publish posts that include such material unless they indicate that
permission has been given.

We request that posters limit the number of posts they send to the
list on any given day. Given that our goal is a manageable list
(manageable both for moderators and subscribers), the list accepts 75
or fewer messages per day, though these parameters may be changed at
the discretion of the list moderator.

Like all systems, the listserv will sometimes be down: if you feel
your message has been delayed or lost, *please wait at least one day
to see if it shows up*, then check the archive to be sure the message
is not posted there; if you still feel there is a problem, you may
wish to contact the editors at <poetics.list@gmail.com>.

7. Flaming
"Flame" messages will not be tolerated on the Poetics List. We define
'flaming' as any post that resembles a personal attack or personal
insult to anyone--subscriber or not. This, of course, includes racist,
sexist, or other slurs as well as ad hominem arguments in which the
person rather than their work is attacked; in other words while
critique of a person's work is welcome (critical inquiry is one of the
main functions of the list), this critique cannot extend to a critique
or criticism of the person.

This is a very interesting thread but it would be muchly useful to
have more than just a list of names...

& where does sound poetry fit into this or someone like Jerry
Rothenberg who accompanies himself with various handheld percussion.
& the wonderful performances of Alison Knowles who makes music
instruments like drums & rattles out of handmade paper.

Talisman is publishing two important books this week: a new translation
of Panait Istrati's "Kyra Kyralina" by Christopher Sawyer-Laucanno and
the second volume in John High's trilogy, "The Book of Unknowing." For
details, see
http://www.spdbooks.org/Search/Default.aspx?SearchTerm=Kyra+Kyralina
and
http://www.spdbooks.org/Producte/9781584980681/a-book-of-unknowing.aspx.

A brief note re: the Istrati book: this is one of the great Modernist
novels, much celebrated abroad, although until now little known in the
United States. -- When an earlier translation appeared in the 1920s, a
reviewer in Time magazine said the book was not "for the general
public, which takes unkindly to abnormality no matter how subtly
treated." In short, the hero happens to be gay. We can hope that
Americans in 2010 are better prepared to deal with such issues, for
truly "Kyra Kyralina" is a delight, not to be missed. Istrati, wrote
Romain Rolland, "is a born storyteller, a teller of Oriental tales, and
once he launches into a story, no one knows, not even him, if it will
last an hour or a thousand and one nights."

Flim Forum Press presents
Aaaaaaaaaaalice by Jennifer Karmin

travelogue in 11 cantos
scored for polyvocal improvisation

112 pages, 7x9
ISBN 978-0-9790888-3-4
http://www.aaaaaaaaaaalice.blogspot.com


"This book, a score, is full of information both literal and (im)possible.
Do dip in; see what you come out with."

=E2=80=94 Bernadette Mayer


"Jennifer Karmin brings an openness and generosity to these poems of
public address and private insistence. Aaaaaaaaaaalice's buoyant charm
calls out for new listeners."

=E2=80=94 Charles Bernstein


"I like tightly proposed structures in which anything can happen & does
because the more tightly controlled the structures, the more explosively
the language will implode, disseminate, fold in or out or whatever it is
it needs to do to loosen up or reverse direction & meaning. And that=E2=80=

fun of Aaaaaaaaaaalice, lithe row of straight a=E2=80=99s followed by bitin=

=E2=80=94 Pierre Joris


"Alice and anime, Asia and uncertainty, we do so want our sounds to make
sense, our textual travels to have a guide, even if that guide is the
white rabbit that will hide. Aaaaaaaaaaalice is the sound and sight of the
disappearing rabbit, the one with a hat, the one who pops up with regular
unpredictability whenever we go somewhere not here, and while words will
swivel around us like our very own heads, making the unfamiliar familiar
and the familiar unfamiliar, making no sense but nonsense and non-sense
sense, like in this very text, what=E2=80=99s moreover curious, as Karmin r=
ightly
notes, is that 'yesterday a man was walking.' "

Lora Bloom and I would qualify.

Lora fronts the poetic experimental avant-garde noise band, Radio Eris.

http://www.myspace.com/radio5eris

I've recorded tracks with various studio musicians, and I'm about to reenter
the studio for the curated Oracle Sessions on the Main Street West label
(West Philadelphia).

Hi -

My sound files are in a new archive - please check it out!

ESP-Disk has given me server space for my sound/music works (solos and
collaborations). I won't have them any longer at - www.alansondheim.org,
but do check out -

http://www.espdisk.com/alansondheim/

The following has the latest at the top - at this point, however, it
depends only on upload order -

http://www.espdisk.com/alansondheim/?M=D

Eventually there will be about 550 or more files up. They're almost all
mp3s. Please enjoy, and let me know if you have questions about individual
works. (There are about 240 up now; it's a long upload.)

When I make newer pieces, I'll announce them with the new URL; they'll be
at the top of the list. Note this work is all for free, but you can still
support the musicians!

I want to thank everyone at espdisk.com for giving me this space. Needless
to say, ESP-Disk, like every alternative recording company, needs your
support!

Thanks, Alan

Explain art is theft.

I offer a prize of $100 to the best answer.  In memory of a poet in
Binghamton who sent me $100 via Paypal when I was broke, the only word I could
think of for poor.

The subject came up last year at WOMPO, and the women and men unanimously
cited Eliot, as if nothing theoretical has happened since Eliot's
syllogism. Those of you who studied theory for many years, Eliot's remark  is all?
Picasso.  I looked up Pound, and Pound's idea is more  interesting, something
about a mountain.

I was glad after renting Tom & Viv years after its release that I had  read
Eliot early.  Four Quartets.  Woolf, for that matter.   Rodin.  Great
artists incarcerate?

Substitutivity.  Art is poetry, piety, carnivality?  Art is  what?

Chicago Style.  300 words.

HOW TO WRITE

by derek beaulieu

available from your favourite independent bookseller!

How to Write is a perverse Coles Notes: a paradigm of prosody where =
writing as sampling, borrowing, cutting=C2=AD and =C2=ADpasting and =
mash=C2=AD-up meets literature. This collection of conceptual short =
=EF=AC=81ction takes inspiration from Lautr=C3=A9amont=E2=80=99s decree =
that =E2=80=9Cplagiarism is necessary. It is implied in the idea of =
progress. It clasps the author=E2=80=99s sentence tight, uses his =
expressions, eliminates a false idea, replaces it with the right =
idea.=E2=80=9D=20


=20

Already early in the twentieth century, the modernist Ezra Pound =
asserted that poets should =E2=80=9Cmake it new,=E2=80=9D and of course =
by =E2=80=9Cit=E2=80=9D he meant =E2=80=9Cthe tradition=E2=80=9D: the =
materiality of pre=C2=AD-existent writing. The assertion is by no means =
original, much less post-modern: John Donne, for example, argued =
centuries ago that =E2=80=9Call mankind is of one author, and is one =
volume.=E2=80=9D=20

=20

 How to Write is an instruction manual for the demise of ownership. A =
multitudinous dialogue of writers and subjects, words and contexts, it =
unleashes a cacophony of voices where authors don=E2=80=99t own their =
words, they merely rent them from other authors. Containing ten pieces =
of conceptual prose ranging from the purely appropriated through the =
entirely recom=C2=ADposed, and covering a range of texts from the =
anonymous to the famous, it includes samplings from, among many others: =
Lawrence Sterne; Agatha Christie; Bob Kane; Roy Lichtenstein; and every =
piece of text within one block of the author=E2=80=99s home. Its title =
story is an exhaustive record of every incidence of the words =
=E2=80=9Cwrite=E2=80=9D or =E2=80=9Cwrites=E2=80=9D in forty different =
English =C2=ADlanguage texts picked aesthetically to represent a =
disparate number of genres.=20

=20

With How to Write, beaulieu suggests writers and artists would be better =
served to =E2=80=9Cmake it reframed, make it borrowed, make it =
re=C2=ADcontextualized.=E2=80=9D By recasting the canon with cut=C2=ADup =
directions for successful writing, catalogues of events, and lists of =
vocabulary, he gleefully illustrates Picasso=E2=80=99s dictum that =
=E2=80=9CGood artists copy. Great artists steal.=E2=80=9D

The Belgian Poet Dirk Elst, you can also add to your list.
You can find more on him on his blogsite: http://dirkelst.blogspot.com/ which
is in Dutch but he writes and performs also in English, see also:
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vv538I9hdVk&feature=related,
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOo_WM-bWbk and
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZnZc5ZH9mU

Fragments out of one of his latest performance shows.
I worked with Dirk for several performances and I recommend him as a poet, a
performer and a musician.

Dear Snezana,


There are a lot of poets who have been involved with music in one way or
another. Off the top of my head.... Some of the more famous ones: Carl
Sandburg, Patti Smith, Jim Carroll, Amiri Baraka, Robert Hunter, Cecil
Taylor, Ed Sanders, Tuli Kupferberg, Allen Ginsberg. Less famous: Barbara
Barg, Maggie Dubris, Jim Brodey, Clark Coolidge, Jayne Cortez, Bob Holman,
David Henderson, Elinor Nauen, Ravi Singh (Neal Hackman); Janet Hamill; Jan=
e
Siberry, Marc Nasdor, Ellen Carter and Sparrow (their band Foamola), Vernon
Reid (more music than poetry), Vernon Frazer, Miguel Algarin, Ted Greenwald=
,
David Meltzer, Steven Taylor, the late Sekou Sundiatta. Then there are poet=
s
who musically vocalize in performing their works (just to name a few):
Tracie Morris, Anne Waldman, Jerome Rothenberg, Edwin Torres, the late Pedr=
o
Pietri.=20

Some of my music activities over the years: wrote songs; played guitar &
sang; mixed soundtrack music for various readings/performances/plays;
collaborated fairly extensively with composer Garrett List; played guitar
and sang in all-composer bands (the Charles Lee Redman Trio, the Prairie
Oysters, and Peter Gordon=B9s Love of Life Orchestra); wrote poems with sung
lines in them.

Sincerely,

Ed Friedman=20

Hey Everyone,

Carolyn and I have started a spice club that I thought might interest
you.  Kickstarter has a great model for arts based businesses.  We'd
love to send you some spices.

You can sign up here:
http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/716933849/ravens-occasional-spice-club

What is Raven's Occasional Spice Club?

Are you ever bored by the foods you are eating? Think all food is
tasting bland? Can=92t find any new flavors? If so, you need to join
Raven=92s Occasional Spice Club!

In the spice club, members receive a small packet of a rare spice
(such as berbere from Ethiopia), a homemade spice (such as pecoconut,
a novel blend of powdered pecans and coconut), a strange spice (such
as puffed lotus seeds), or a unique spice (such as persnickety=97what=92s
that? You need to join to find out!). The spices are specially chosen
by our curator, Francis Raven. Whenever possible, the ingredients used
in the spice club are sustainably produced.

As you can tell, at the Occasional Spice Club, we have a broad
definition of what a spice is. Something is a spice if it (1) makes
food more interesting or tasty, (2) is used in nutritionally
insignificant quantities, and (3) can be sprinkled or shaken.

Why the club? Because spice is the spice of life. That=92s our motto.

What is included in an installment of the spice club?

With each installment of the spice club, you will receive a small
amount of the spice in question, a recipe (or two or three) using the
spice, fun facts about its origin and history, and maybe some artsy
photos of it or examples of its use in literature or a poem written in
its honor or celebrity testimonials.

What does your pledge cover?

Your pledge covers the costs of buying and/or making the spices,
producing the informational content accompanying the spice, shipping,
and the time of our dedicated research and curatorial staff in
investigating the spices.

peace out
francis and carolyn

Yeah. I agree that explain art is the worst kind of art.

But I don't think that it is theft.

++Please mark your calendars for this Wednesday April 21st. Doug Basford
will give a talk at 2pm in The Poetry Collection, 420 Capen:

"'what do they mean by* noigandres*?': On Translating Anglophone Poets into

Italian"

This talk will be held in The Poetry Collection, 420 Capen @ SUNY Buffalo.
This event is free and open to the public.


Small Press in the Archive Lecture Series dedicates itself to the
study of poetry outside the traditional literary historical plot. The
lectures in this series draw on materials in The Poetry Collection, at
SUNY Buffalo in order to explore community/discourse formations, the
status of ephemera and the making of genre, the conditions of literary
production, transatlantic cross-pollinations in and between specific
magazines, the careers of poets, the role of book art, and how the
little magazine functions in the making of the avant-garde.

theft + disguise = metaphor?

1. theft:  a repetition that doesn't use negation for instantiation.
eg.: a, a  not  a, A.
2. disguise: a different species within one genus.
3. metaphor: gifts of insubordinate resemblance

if art is the use of metaphor, creative comparison, then it is theft.

Dear mIEKAL,
indeed a good question, thinking also about the soundpoets like the Dutch
poets Jaap Blonk and Rosalie Hirsch, the Belgian poets Maja Jantar and Jelle
Meander...

here's a shot. but off the cuff.
art is "free" in the sense that one is participating in a field of
activity that is theoretically unbounded, but because there is so much
ego involved, availing oneself of that freedom feels to oneself and
others like theft, because things are not supposed to be free. One uses
good ideas, images, words, etc from others because how could one not?
being a social animal and learning everything from others.  but because
of the Romantic/Enlightenment emphasis on individuality and inventive
genius, that sociability is perceived and sometimes experienced as
stepping on other people's toes, using one's time illegitimately (i.e.
stealing from the boss to find time to write, etc), etc. etc.

The Belgian Poet Dirk Elst, you can also add to your list.
You can find more on him on his blogsite: http://dirkelst.blogspot.com/ whi=
ch
is in Dutch but he writes and performs also in English, see also:

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DtOo_WM-bWbk and

Fragments out of one of his latest performance shows.
I worked with Dirk for several performances and I recommend him as a poet, =
a
performer and a musician.

Andrew Joron was born in San Antonio, Texas, in 1955, and grew up in
Stuttgart, Germany; Lowell, Massachusetts; and Missoula, Montana. He
attended U.C. Berkeley, where he majored in history and philosophy of
science. After a decade and a half spent writing science-fiction poetry,
culminating in his volume Science Fiction (Pantograph Press, 1992), he
turned to a more philosophical mode of speculative lyric. This work has been
collected in The Removes (Hard Press, 1999), Fathom (Black Square Editions,
2003) and The Sound Mirror (Flood Editions, 2008). He is also the
translator, from the German, of the Marxist-Utopian philosopher Ernst
Bloch's Literary Essays (Stanford University Press, 1998), and of the
surrealist Richard Anders's aphorisms and prose poems. His literary essays
have been collected in The Cry at Zero (Counterpath Press, 2008). City
Lights will publish his Trance Archive: New and Selected Poems in the spring
of 2010. Joron lives in Berkeley, where he works as a freelance
bibliographer and indexer.



Rachel Loden is the author of Dick of the Dead, currently one of five
finalists for the California Book Award. The Washington Post's "Poet's
Choice" column featured a poem from the book, and it has been called "oddly
sublime" and "intoxicating" by the Poetry Project Newsletter and "expansive
and whimsical" by the Brooklyn Rail. Loden's first book, Hotel Imperium, won
the Contemporary Poetry Series competition and was selected as one of the
ten best poetry books of the year by the San Francisco Chronicle, which
called it "quirky and beguiling." It was also shortlisted for the Bay Area
Book Reviewers Award. Her work has appeared in New American Writing, the
Paris Review, Jacket, two editions of the Best American Poetry series, and
many other magazines and anthologies. She is the recipient of a Pushcart
Prize, a Fellowship in Poetry from the California Arts Council, an &NOW
Award, and a grant from the Fund for Poetry.



C. S. Giscombe has authored books of poetry Prairie Style, Giscombe Road,
and Here, and the nonfiction book Into and Out of Dislocation. His poetry
has been published in several anthologies, including Best American Poetry,
Oxford Anthology of African American Poetry, Lyric Postmoderns, and
elsewhere. Giscombe was recently awarded the American Book Award for 2008
for Prairie Style. He currently is a Professor of Poetry at U.C. Berkeley.



The de Young Poetry Series is curated by Paul Hoover, a poet, editor, and
professor of creative writing at San Francisco State University.

The word "is" functions both as copula and expression of identity. If
I say "X is Y" I can mean either that Y is some way of describing X or
that X and Y are identical. If they are identical then they can be
substituted for one another in a sentence without any change in
meaning. Observe: 1.) "Theft is the taking of something from someone
who has more right to possess it than the thief." 2.) "Art is the
taking of something from someone who has more right to possess it than
the artist." If there is no change in meaning here, then "Art is
Theft" is a mere expression of identity. This is not the case.
Therefore "is" in this sentence is functioning as a copula. In that
case theft is a predicate of art. It is possible that the sentences
"Art is theft" and "Art is yellow" are both true in a way that would
not be possible if the "is" in both sentences were functioning as a
marker of identity. To explain "Art is theft" you must therefore just
know what "theft" means as a predicate. As such it is worth pointing
out that theft as a predicate indicates that art is a crime, art takes
possession of some (intellectual) property that does not belong to the
artist. To create art then is to appropriate and to do wrong; to be
guilty and deserving of punishment. "Art is theft" is therefore a
condemnation of God as first creator for creating us and a warning to
artists that there is nothing redemptive in what they do. In creation,
the artist takes from infinite possibility and fixes in imitation the
previously unrealized. Such an act is clearly larcenous and its
perpetrators mere criminals trafficking in contraband.

You have raised a  question that I've been pondering for some time although
perhaps in a different context. This past Sunday, I had Steven Smith,
formerly of the sound poetry group Owen Sound as well as director of Sage
Hill Writing who is now director of Literary Arts at the Banff  Centre, on
my radio  show 'Speaking of Poets' heard every Sunday from 4:30 to 5:00 p.m.
CST on CKUW 95.9 FM (and available for streaming or download from the CKUW
website). We talked about the concepts of sampling and found poetry. I've
had poets as diverse as Karen Solie and Jan Conn to the experimental such as
Erin  Moure, Lisa  Robertson and Angela Carr on the show who have used
these techniques. I have also had discussion with poets who are aghast at
this plagiarism. What are the parameters in these days of FLARF poetic
techniques for the legitimacy of 'borrowings'? When does one have to cite?
I've heard others who, if wanting to use a phrase, line or brief passage
from another writer's work  actually indicate that they would send a request
to that writer for permission to use that material. Is this necessary?

here's a shot. but off the cuff.
art is "free" in the sense that one is participating in a field of
activity that is theoretically unbounded, but because there is so much
ego involved, availing oneself of that freedom feels to oneself and
others like theft, because things are not supposed to be free. One uses
good ideas, images, words, etc from others because how could one not?
being a social animal and learning everything from others.  but because
of the Romantic/Enlightenment emphasis on individuality and inventive
genius, that sociability is perceived and sometimes experienced as
stepping on other people's toes, using one's time illegitimately (i.e.
stealing from the boss to find time to write, etc), etc. etc.

 haiku reading at this year's
Sakura Matsuri (Cherry Blossom Festival), at the Brooklyn Botanic
Garden.

steve dlachinsky, tony pupello, yuko otomo, cor van den huevel and others

 For those of you who don't know, the
Brooklyn Botanic Garden has MORE species of cherry than anywhere outside
of Japan.  We don't have more trees than Washington - but way more
varieties.  And the festival boasts daiko drumming, ikebana, Butoh
dance, and many, many other cultural events.

If you plan on going, just make sure to get there early as the lines to
get in can be daunting!  (Folks are just clamoring to hear the
haiku/senryu poets!).

A carrot is dangled in front of the artist (if a poetics is art).

The artist wants the carrot (sound of empty stomach).

The condition of art amidst capital=92s excesses, paroxysms, death grimaces=
 on
a Halloween mask--the condition IS theft=97of the artist=92s work, mode of
existence.

The theft is all around you.

The artist doesn=92t care about creativity, originality, authority, the art=
ist
wants the carrot.  What else is pushing her to produce?  The artist, except
for weird anomalous individuals amongst millions who work in the arts, is
never paid/given according to their contribution, unless that reciprocation
appear outside the system entirely, with none of its inherent values.  The
only value to be gained by the artist must be an unvalued value.

The artist=92s capacity and capabilities are enormous, while her needs are
presumed to be few.



Analyst=92s couch.

Language of shipping offices.



Art is theft: because the work envisaged needs no form, there is an
unlimited number of previously constituted examples of the very form that s=
o
excited her.  Why write?  Only mix.  Art is appropriation because there is
no compelling reason to write from one=92s head or heart anymore.  There ar=
e
nothing but examples of the conception already out there, one click away,
already amply and fully articulated.  Steal that.  Mix it up a little.  Sel=
l
it under your name.  Theft?  No, it's market.  Moving units.  One who can
shift an icon most effectively onto their person, an affiliated name.



The artist steals back the thing the culture demanded of her, and damned he=
r
for, or pays a heavy price.



The operative condition IS theft.  The work is stolen from the artist,
reframed, engineered and mass produced, and then she must pay to consume it=
.


The EXPERIENCE of a work of art is pure gratuity.

Six answers so far.  I'll keep it open while replies are  oncoming.  My
objective is to realize something I haven't realized (come to  believe) in
reading poetry and observing other arts as well.

"If art be theft which life reflects,
And mind be life that art inflects,
Then all--art, life & mind--be in such debt
That steals the primacy of prime
Unhinges light from time
And . . ."

The first lines of a boring poem discarded by Richard Lapauvre, ca. 1962.

What if art is an invitation to attention?

I've read a lot of different aesthetics and poetics and manifestos, and =
this seems to be a recurring theme: "hey, consider this."

There's a lot of evidence that we view attention as =
appropriation/ownership: grasp, comprehend, "get it," and so on.

And often our ways of saying "obscure" or "difficult" or "multiplex" =
involve inability to grasp or penetrate. We wrestle with slippery =
subjects, find it hard, impenetrable.

Maybe there's some limitation in our imagination, sot that we have this =
expression of body in any desire, even if it's to know something without =
material qualities.

But, so, yes, maybe art is theft in the same way that any apprehension =
of the phenomenal world is theft, except art is inviting theft?

So, for me, any reframing of words--even if it's saying that "I have =
struggled and have finally rewritten Don Quixote perfectly, word for =
word"--is an invitation for a new sort of attention and is therefore a =
new work of art. So, no, maybe art can never be theft.

Though of course art can be stolen, even if it's just a reproduction.*



*And to that one special person: I know you, my pretty, have my Awede =
edition of Articulation of Sound Forms in Time, my precious.

Hi All,

In addition to this lengthening thread, I've received over 20 e-mails
outside of the list in response to my vague query, so thank you all
for that. Lots of names and links to music, so many in fact, it's will
take a lot of time to get to all of them.

Things are crystallizing in my head a little bit, so here's the
current condition of my thoughts.

I had in mind poets who perform in rock/pop/hip-hop idioms rather than
poets who perform their texts accompanied by music and/or sound, and I
didn't have in mind sound poetics. Tracie Morris is simply Tracie
Morris, a poet who works with sound and rhythm kind of like a musician
would, and I'm a fan, but that's not the kind of a poet I'm after in
this query. (Although I find it pretty fascinating that she has said
that she went into poetry even though she wanted to be an MC, but
found it too daunting to struggle with the sexism in the industry side
of the game; I paraphrase from memory here, I apologize if I'm
completely twisting her words.)

I'm not even after poets who work mainly with text, but who often
collaborate with musicians for the sake of performance, or for the
sake of experimenting with various historic avant-garde or neo-avant
practices. The reason I'm not pointing my searchlight in that
direction is because such a practice is very much out in the open and
I can easily click on the bookmark tab in my browser and listen to
stuff on ubuweb or pennsound, etc. I'm a fan of that too. Poets who
perform their texts also routinely mention such practices in their bio
blurbs and interviews, as they well should!

The reason why I'm after the poets who work in rock/pop/hip-hop idioms
is that it seems to me that poets who play/sing/rap/spin in bands may
be numerous, but they keep that kind of music separate from their
poetic practice and don't let the two worlds overlap too much and
therefore they can't be found on a fictive rock/pop/hip-hop equivalent
of ubuweb. My hypothesis would be that it's because we are programmed
to specialize and be professionals, to be afraid of being marginalized
as someone who dabbles in poetry and in music side-by-side.

Someone said in their reply to me that no one can "dabble" in music,
because it takes too much work and practice. That's true. You can't
dabble in music or poetry as far as creating it goes. I didn't mean by
"dabble" that someone out there plays a triangle every once in a while
and claims they're musicians or writes limericks for fun and claims
they're poets :-) But however much you practice and perform, unless
you are at least a little bit successful and have a following, you'll
be perceived as a dabbler, right? I'm sort of interested in
reception/perception and playing the game, rather than abstracted
artistic practice.

There is then the global question of "the game" and to what extent
combining the practice of writing cerebral poetry with the practice of
playing silly music (that is supposed to make people literally shake,
dance, mosh, head-bang, or at least bop), is beneficial or detrimental
to one's "career." (I actually have no doubts that this combo can only
be good artistically for the resulting texts and music, as long as the
poet/musician in question has enough time to devote to each interest
and doesn't need much sleep.)

And just to be completely honest, there is a personal stake in my
query in that I've recently begun playing and singing in two bands, am
writing a lot of songs and starting to perform in clubs etc., while
I'm of course still writing and translating poetry, sending it out,
and trying to get published, succeeding here and there. But the sheer
number of responses this has gotten makes me think a) this list is
full of friendly people helping me come up with my little database of
poet/musicians, and b) there is a bigger issue here than my
ego-centric soul-searching. I didn't expect that my query would yield
such an avalanche of information, so thanks, and please share your
further thoughts on this topic. Best,

Snezana (Nana for short :-)

the translation and appropriation of not
only that which we approve of or
value but that which is most reprehensible;

to separate the intentionality of
the author from the production of meaning
and EMBRACE exemplarity

not just as an argumentative or
rhetorical strategy, but as a
poetics in and of itself:

to let the detritus of our cultural
and politcal lives speak
on their own terms---to think of

the poet less as the painter and
more as the craftsman who
constructs the frame


2

this past decade and the future of poetry
has eroded the pretense of the confessional
and the vulgarity of the topical & the opportunism
of influence---in the sense that the topical simply
adopts the tropes and rhetorical logic of media's
narrative structure--- (ie, the war is happening, we
oppose the war, but how long can you write about war?
what happens when the war is over? do we just find
another war? and if there is none do we sit around
WAITING for one with baited breath?) it highlights the
value of the poetic voice addressing and reflecting the
everyday--- of interrupting and detourning; of intervening
in the narratives, language, thought--processes and values of
our present culture and thereby, not only oppose & question
the logic and practice of war, but the behavior, language, and
philosophical foundation that war is built upon--- to construct
dialectical "IMAGES" which are concrete (in the vispo and literal
sense), enduring, and impactful collections and galleries of
the ephemera & carrion of culture; as well as the traumatic
and the horroific; as well as the joyful and celebratory--- not
in the delusional quest for permanence or tradition but
the wholly absurd and yet wholly necessary quest to use poetry
to not only settle those unsettled debts of history, but to challenge
the very notion of indebtedness--- to light the fuses which will result
in these explosions of these dialectical images in the minds of the
reader: to write poetry in the service of uncovering and enacting
new consciousness.


3

the
love of
linguistic play, an
anarchistic spree celebrating the
freedom of consciousnes, which is
the endless possibility of the verbal
expression of consciousness that is language---fashioning
  "chorals out of random input"

Let me spare "noise" music from this note. "Noise music" isn't the first th=

On its own art doesn't exist--like a tree or a rock exist. It's empty air.
Someone has to make something out of something then someone calls it art.

last night i hosted the 3rd reading of our cruellest month series. i
wrote out instructions for our audience: to appropriate lines from the
poets and write their own poems, which we're plastering to our office
walls. i have pictures from the event, with a big sign that says
"ART=3DTHEFT"

so funny

hmm. yes, i did walk in a circle, i'm afraid. i see that that is a true fact.

i wonder if that makes my conclusion irrational or non-rational. do
some of my premises have to be true for the one and not the other?

... on board the blue line for o'hare.

The word "is" functions both as copula and expression of identity. If I say=
 "X is Y" I can mean either that Y is some way of describing X or that X an=
d Y are identical. If they are identical then they can be substituted for o=
ne another in a sentence without any change in meaning. Observe: 1.) "Theft=
 is the taking of something from someone who has more right to possess it t=
han the thief." 2.) "Art is the taking of something from someone who has mo=
re right to possess it than the artist." If there is no change in meaning h=
ere, then "Art is Theft" is a mere expression of identity. This is not the =
case. Therefore "is" in this sentence is functioning as a copula. In that c=
ase theft is a predicate of art. It is possible that the sentences "Art is =
theft" and "Art is yellow" are both true in a way that would not be possibl=
e if the "is" in both sentences were functioning as a marker of identity. T=
o explain "Art is theft" you must therefore just know what "theft"
 means as a predicate. As such it is worth pointing out that theft as a pre=
dicate indicates that art is a crime, art takes possession of some (intelle=
ctual) property that does not belong to the artist. To create art then is t=
o appropriate and to do wrong; to be guilty and deserving of punishment. "A=
rt is theft" is therefore a condemnation of God as first creator for creati=
ng us and a warning to artists that there is nothing redemptive in what the=
y do. In creation, the artist takes from infinite possibility and fixes in =
imitation the previously unrealized. Such an act is clearly larcenous and i=
ts perpetrators mere criminals trafficking in contraband.

Please join us as poets Emily Rosko and Anthony Reed read from their
work this Sunday, April 25th, 2010 at 3:00 p.m. at the Herbert F.
Johnson Museum of Art on the Cornell University campus. The reading is
free and open to the public.

EMILY ROSKO is the author of Raw Goods Inventory, winner of the 2005
Iowa Poetry Prize and the 2007 Glasgow Prize for Emerging Writers from
Shenandoah. Recipient of the Stegner, the Ruth Lilly, and the Javits
fellowships, her poems have been included in Agni, The Beloit Poetry
Journal, The Denver Quarterly, The Laurel Review, and Pleiades. She
earned an M.F.A. at Cornell University and a Ph.D. in Creative Writing
and Literature at the University of Missouri. She is the editor, with
Anton Vander Zee, of a collection of essays, A Broken Thing: Poets on
the Line, which will be published by The University of Iowa Press in
2010.  She has been residing in Ithaca for this past year, serving as
a Visiting Assistant Professor at Cornell, and, in the fall, she will
be an Assistant Professor at the College of Charleston.

ANTHONY REED, a recent Ph.D. graduate from Cornell University's
English Department, is a Mellon graduate fellow at the Society for the
Humanities. Next year he will join the faculty of the English and
African American Studies departments at Yale University.  He is also a
graduate of the M.F.A. program at the University of Michigan (Ann
Arbor). Currently, he is working on a series of poems called 'The
Conquering Ayin' as well as a fragmentary novel called The Infinite,
both of which are concerned with intimacy and music.

This event has been made possible in part with public funds from the
Community Arts Partnership of Tompkins County / NYS Council on the
Arts Decentralization Program. SOON Productions is dedicated to
bringing innovative poets and writers to the Ithaca area for readings
and talks. Please visit our website at  http://soonproductions.org for

theft + disguise = metaphor?
off the cuff.
By definition originality is impossible.
Such an act is clearly larcenous and its perpetrators mere criminals
trafficking in contraband.

I already own all of it

You have raised a  question that I've been pondering for some time although
perhaps in a different context.
What else is pushing her to produce?

I'll keep it open

The first lines of a boring poem
[are] an invitation to attention?
Change without exchange.
an example of begging the question.

My thoughts exactly.

I've heard that before.
linguistic play, an
anarchistic spree

tee hee.

Dear Friend of The Poetry Project,
=20
The Project faces significant financial challenges in 2010. The economic
environment remains difficult for arts organizations and, as you might know=
,
our new lease with the Church imposes a substantial rent increase.
=20
There are many ways for you to help us continue to create opportunities for
writers to present their work to an engaged, responsive community. One way
is to simply purchase admission for one, or all, of the three special event=
s
scheduled for our annual Spring Fundraising week. Admission for each event
is only $10. Community turnout last Spring helped us raise just over $5,000=
!
=20
* On April 28th, Alice Notley will read in the Sanctuary, with a reception
to follow.=20
* On April 30th, we=B9ll have a panel and a film screening for the book We Sa=
w
the Light: Conversations Between the New American Cinema and Poetry by
Daniel Kane.=20
* Finally, on May 1st, we=B9ll host a performance of =B3John Ashbery=B9s
Self-Portrait in a Convex Mirror for Six Voices.=B2
=20
Please see our Calendar for all the details.
http://poetryproject.org/readings?ec3_after=3Dtoday
=20
If you can=B9t be with us for these events, please show your support by
becoming an esteemed Member of the Poetry Project. A $95 Supporting
Membership will get you and a guest free admission to all regularly
scheduled/non-fundraising Project events, among other perks!
http://poetryproject.org/get-involved/become-a-member
=20
You may also opt to give a tax-deductible contribution of $30=8Bthe price of
admission to all three events=8Bor anything that you feel you can offer. Even
smaller amounts are very welcome.
http://poetryproject.org/get-involved/donate-now
=20
We have always been a poet-run organization whose programming has developed
out of a complete devotion to the risk and heart of contemporary poetry. An=
d
we know we serve a community just as intensely devoted!
=20
Thank you=8Band I look forward to seeing you soon.
=20
Sincerely,
=20
Stacy Szymaszek
Artistic Director

Just to clarify about the "performances" of the songs in the youtube links =
below, the audiofiles were generated by the music notation software that I =
used to compose the songs. I no longer have the chops to perform the piano =
accompaniment. And, as you can hear, there's not much subtlety in the sound=
 - the software cannot do rubato or dynamics, but it does give a general id=
ea of the songs.

Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

Does anyone know of a good book of Antonin Artaud's visual art (drawings, prints, etc)? There seems to be nothing in print at the moment, and even a google search gives very little. I know I've seen lots of intense pieces he did, but I'm not finding anything. An out-of-print title I came across is "Antonin Artaud: Drawings and Prints" by Jacques Derrida. Honestly, I'm not too interested in reading what Derrida has to say, I just want to know if the book has good images (and lots of them). Or any other good source for Artaud's imagery.

Thanks,

Because I dont want to offend,  I have been holding back the urge to say ,
"did you guys rip this topic off from a Creative Writing 101 class?"

 its theft-within-a-theft

or theft-of-theft-discussion

I kind of think that's funny so taking the plunge and just coming out with
it...

Subject:      Rethinking Poetics Conference
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=ISO-8859-1

*Rethinking Poetics Conference
*Columbia University, NYC
June 11-13, 2010

Announcing the Columbia-Penn Poetics Initiative.

We are convening a three-day conference at Columbia (June 11-13, 2010),
"Rethinking Poetics." It is our sense that the practices of poetics are in
danger of becoming pro forma and that a focused, skeptical examination of
basic assumptions will be most useful. Terms continue to be used routinely
in circumstances that increasingly call for nuanced or even fundamental
change. What does "materiality of the signifier" mean in the era of data
mining or platform instability? What does "news" mean? How useful are
current periodizations? Such questions can be multiplied.

Given that new questions need to be raised and old certainties troubled, our
goal is to have a conference dedicated to articulating what most needs to be
rethought, what familiar formulations seem increasingly inadequate, what new
directions seem best to pursue.

In order to allow for time for substantial conversation, we are scheduling
no multiple panels and no plenaries; rather, there will be a series of
plenary-panels, two in the morning and two in the afternoon, with four or
five speakers each taking 10-12 minutes for themselves, leaving half the
session for more general discussion. There will be a panel chair to moderate
discussion, but there will be no introductions.

Participants will include Rachel Zolf, Rodrigo Toscano, Jennifer
Scappettone, Brent Hayes Edwards, Lytle Shaw, Juliana Spahr, Kenny
Goldsmith, Erica Hunt, Alan Golding, Monica de la Torre, Andrew Schelling,
Bruce Andrews, Michael Taussig, Joan Retallack, Rachel DuPlessis, K. Silem
Muhammad, Jena Osman, Craig Dworkin, Elizabeth Willis, Barrett Watten, Rob
Fitterman, Jonathan Skinner, Marjorie Perloff, Sherwin Bitsui, Mark Nowak,
Judith Goldman, C. S. Giscombe, Steve Evans, Stephanie Young, Lisa
Robertson, Paul Stephens, Rob Halpern, Jeff Dirksen, Ben Friedlander, Joshua
Clover, Michael Taussig, Astrid Lorange, James Livingston, Jeff Nealon,
Richard Doyle, Tan Lin, Tonya Foster, Matthew Hofer, John Melillo, Susan
Howe, and Charles Bernstein.

Conference costs for the 3-day conference are $50/university faculty,
$20/student & unaffiliated; $10 1-day entrance.

For more information and updated information, including conference
registration, please visit our blog at
http://rethinkingpoetics.wordpress.com/.

Please send any questions or comments to Aaron Winslow at rethinkingpoetics
AT gmail.com.

Art is borrowing, as well as the inability to locate the lenders and
an unwillingness to share credit.

This will be no thebolactic oasis in your preciously frantic first week, no=
r
a storm in your cup of tea, each sweet drop of milk registered by the eye o=
f
the Hawk. Rather, prepare for the inhabitation of the eye of the storm whic=
h
blows the disproportionate Hawkeye to rags.

ALSO, on Monday 26th April, don't miss the gala reading celebrating the new
anthology, Infinite Difference: Other Poetries by UK Women Poets. It takes

Hi All,

There is also the generation of people who were first poets, but then
(while still very young and unknown) choose rock as their preferred
form--Richard Hell, Tom Verlaine, John Doe, Exene Cervenka, and Patti
Smith come to mind first of all. They grew up on the tail end of the
idea that being a poet is the coolest thing, while rock became
spinal-tappish, but then punk rock came and made rock cooler than
poetry again, and of course it was a bit more viable profession
economically. Richard Hell talks about that openly in interviews, and
those who knew John Doe back in Baltimore testify he went through a
similar thought process, and there is nothing wrong with that. I'm
glad those people chose music over poetry, because it's not like
poetry word suffered because of their conversion; meanwhile I can't
imagine what music would have sounded if that generation didn't take
up instruments and singing.

And Jim Carroll kept double lives till the end, right?

But that generation, especially the above names, is super
well-documented, so that's not what I'm looking for. I'm looking for
the later and contemporary, less-documented generations, when rock
became as financially inviable as poetry, or in a way even less so,
because at least you can teach comp with your mfa, ma, of ph.d.
degree.

So I'm adding another dimension to my query: the purely economic one.
I wonder how many people who would rather be in bands, write songs and
record and tour full time, in the end focus more on poetry and
publishing and teaching in order to survive?

too deep
art is always a take that seems like a give
and a give that takes - borrowing / theft appropriation
from others from nature  -  an honest thief as was said is the best
or a good thief well disguising his/her theft
as picasso said the highest honor he could give / pay anorher
is to steal from them
a make over  not a copy -  incorporation and hopefully crediting those
that influenced your piece in some way

For those of you who don't know, the
Brooklyn Botanic Garden has MORE species of cherry than anywhere outside
of Japan.  We don't have more trees than Washington - but way more
varieties.  And the festival boasts daiko drumming, ikebana, Butoh
dance, and many, many other cultural events.

If you plan on going, just make sure to get there early as the lines to
get in can be daunting!  (Folks are just clamoring to hear the
haiku/senryu poets!).

Dear Ann:

Before--and introducing--Olson at the Berkely festival Robert Duncan also
speaks of the poet as a stealer of fire--and that as a thief of fire, for
him Olson is a great "fire source." It is the ( I am not sure how old the
idea is, rather Romantic or earlier) concept of Prometheus as Stealer of
Fire with the image of the Act of Creation imagined as Fire being stolen
from the Gods.

A very interesting proposal is this one:

Plagiarism is necessary. Progress implies it. It holds tight an author=92s
phrase, uses his expressions, eliminates a false idea, and replaces it with
just the right idea.

=96 *Comte de Lautr=E9amont* (Isidore Ducasse), *Po=E9sies II* (1870)

Lautreamont sees "progress" as the plagiarising  of everything but the
"right idea" from a previous writer/poet. The "right idea" "
corrects" a falsity from the previous piece of writing, which may simply be
the introduction of a new fact, thus making "progress" towards a more
precise "truth" or "actuality."  (Or--of a "sur reality"--a higher reality,
as Breton and the Surre;laist found a direct antecdent in Lautreamont in th=
e
1920's.

Pascal also notes:  "It is not the materials which are new, but the order o=
f
their arrangement."

I hope these three versions of the theft idea are helpful!

In the words of an old song by  The Band:  "I am thief--and i dig it!"

onwo/ards!!!

Champagne Cabaret @ 7PM: Food, Wine, Performance!

Virtuoso Performer Margaret Leng Tan Plays Toy PianoMargaret Leng Tan =20=

has established herself as a major force in the American avant-garde. =20=

She is renowned as a pre-eminent John Cage interpreter and for her =20
performances of American and Asian music that transcend the piano=92s =20=

conventional boundaries.  She has been called =93the queen of the toy =20=

piano=94 by The New York Times. After discovering Cage=92s Suite for Toy =
=20
Piano in 1993, Ms. Tan became fascinated with the artistic potential =20
of the toy piano and, more recently, with other toy instruments as =20
well. In her groundbreaking 1997 album, The Art of the Toy Piano =20
(Point/Universal), she elevated a humble toy to the status of a real =20
instrument. Over the past decade, Ms. Tan=92s diminutive music-theater =20=

of nostalgia and humor has delighted audiences at festivals around the =20=

world.  Her new album She Herself Alone: The Art of the Toy Piano 2 =20
has just been released on Mode Records.

Special Performance from Clare Dolan Clare is a Painter, Director, and =20=

Performer of Cantastoria, Toy Theater, Outdoor Puppetry, and Stilt =20
Dancing, while simultaneously living a secret double life as a nurse =20
in her small Vermont town.  She=92s a veteran of the Bread and Puppet =20=

Theater, and founder of The Museum of Everyday Life.

And of course=85The scintillating and educational "Short Entertaining =20=

History of Toy Theater"by Dr. John Bell with the Great Small Works =20
Orchestra.

  ***

  Dance Fest @ 10PM:

Debo Band Boston=92s own 11 piece Ethio-groove collective was created by =
=20
Ethiopian-American saxophonist Danny Mekonnen as a way of exploring =20
the unique sounds that once filled the dance clubs of =93Swinging =20
Addis.=94 Since 2006, Debo Band has been immersed in the unlikely =20
confluence of traditional East African polyrhythms and pentatonic =20
scales, classic American soul and funk music, and the instrumentation =20=

of Eastern European brass bands, producing a unique form of dance =20
music that Ethiopian audiences instantly recognize as the soundtrack =20
of their youth, carried from party to kitchen on the ubiquitous =20
cassette tapes of the time. With a unique instrumentation =96 including =20=

horns, strings, and accordion =96 that is a nod to the big bands of =20
Haile Selassie=92s time, Debo Band is giving new life to these old =20
sounds, and playing it forward to a new generation and a broader =20
audience.

Slavic Soul Party!  is more than a band, it=92s a promise. Anyone who =20=

has seen them live can attest to that. The massive brass band is a =20
supercollider of Eastern European sounds from the Balkans and all the =20=

funk of American musical traditions like second-line, gospel, and =20
jazz. Hybridity isn=92t just a buzzword with this New York City-based =20=

group =96 domestic and foreign, new and old =96 it=92s a fact of life. =
The =20
fusion even carries over into the title of the band=92s fifth album, =20
Taketron, mashing up Japanese drummer Take Toriyama=92s love of =20
electronic music with the rapid fire of Balkan brass, and the =20
incessant creativity of some of New York=92s finest musicians.

=93Fiery Balkan brass, hip-grinding American grooves, and ecstatic =20
anthems both new and old: Slavic Soul Party! is just what it says. =20
Brash and strong as slivovitz, these nine musicians have forged a =20
virtuosic new brass band music in the heart of New York City =96 melding =
=20
Gypsy, East European, Mexican, and Asian immigrant backgrounds with =20
American jazz and soul =96 and =93developed a reputation for delivering =
a =20
great time.=94 (NY Times)

  Spanglish Fly Spanglish Fly defines its sound as =931968 Barrio=94 =97 =
=20
meaning the Spanish Harlem in the late 60s. The band is bent on =20
cooking up a spicy musical dish comprised of bugaloo, Latin soul and =20
shingaling. Their recipe, in their own words: =93Two pounds of hot mambo =
=20
stirred together with fifteen ounces of Motor-City Motown, deep fried =20=

for three hours, and you get a bucket load of mouthwatering soul =20
latino.=94 The recent EP is Latin Soul y Bugal=FA, featuring special =
guest =20
DJ Turmix and a performance by the Rude Mechanical Orchestra."They =20
will make you dance for sure." -- REmezcla.com

there's a second generation -- well, maybe 1 1/2 generation

while Mike Watt is in the 1st, Lydia Lunch, all of Sonic Youth (Lee Renaldo,
Thurston Moore...)

don't forget that presses that these musicians were able to found, like
12.13.61 and Soft Skull then continued to blur spoken word, music and poetry
-- away from performance art

Mike Watt talks about starting playing music with Creedence covers in high
school, but then as his spiels and lyrics developed in the "Harvard of punk
rock" began to consider these writings to be poems in their own right.

Please join EAI for a special launch event celebrating the publication =20=

of An Art of Limina: Gary Hill=E2=80=99s Works and Writings, a new =
monograph =20
devoted to the works of artist Gary Hill. At EAI, Hill will appear in =20=

conversation with the book's authors, George Quasha and Charles Stein, =20=

poets, writers and artists who have worked interactively and performed =20=

with Hill for over three decades. Hill will discuss and screen =20
selections from his early single-channel videos, tracing the =20
development of his distinctive approach to language, sound and the =20
moving image. Written in close connection with the artist and =20
featuring a foreword by Lynne Cooke, An Art of Limina is the most =20
comprehensive and in-depth treatment of Hill's work to date, =20
presenting extensive information on 104 of his works from the 1970s =20
through the present, as well as seminal writings by the artist.
Gary Hill's art forges an important investigation into the =20
relationships between words and electronic images. Originally trained =20=

as a sculptor, Hill began working in video in 1973 and has produced a =20=

major body of single-channel video and video installations. Hill's =20
first tapes explored formal properties of the emerging medium, =20
particularly through integral conjunctions of electronic visual and =20
audio elements. This exploration would give way to thoroughly unique =20
investigations of linguistics and consciousness in works characterized =20=

by their experimental rigor, conceptual precision and imaginative =20
leaps of discovery. Perhaps as much as any artist using image/sound =20
media, Hill's work in video is about, and is, a new form of writing.

A Hundred Posters, edited by Alan Davies (CD)
Post~Twya: Reset, Jack Kimball
The New Old Paint, Susie Timmons
Memoir and Essay, Michael Gottlieb

In the mid 1970s Alan Davies edited 40 issues of A Hundred Posters. =20
Among those whose work appeared were Ginsberg, Wieners, Eigner, =20
Weiner. The importance of the authors published makes this CD reissue =20=

a solid indication of poetic directions for the present & future.

Initially a spoof of John Ashbery's Flow Chart, Post~Twyla: Reset re-=20
emphasizes daybook metonymy, lexical captures, & graphical meta-=20
commentary to upset the "flow." Cantatas for experimental =20
instruments, jubilant disparities. Alan Davies calls P~T =20
"unremittingly Burroughs-in-bed."

The New Old Paint is Susie Timmons's second poetry collection. Alice =20
Notley noted in her first collection Timmons's "naked" train of =20
thought & her "wit." The same applies here, fully resourceful, =20
totally unexpected, "Hello, I am your American flag / I know; hard to =20=

believe, / a talking flag."

Jennifer Moxley on Memoir and Essay: "A bright young poet arrives =20
penniless in a resplendently decaying New York where he finds a group =20=

of like-minded writers. They join ranks and set out to challenge the =20
establishment. Gottlieb makes this old story new with crisp prose and =20=

thoughtful personal details."

Pre-order before publication, $13.00 each (rather than 16.00) or a =20
full set of 4 for 45.00 (limited offer).

More about Alan Sondheim:

Alan Sondheim was born in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania; he lives with his
partner, Azure Carter, in Brooklyn NY. He holds a B.A. and M.A. from Brown
University in English. A new-media artist, writer, and theorist, he has
exhibited, performed and lectured widely.

Current interests include aesthetics and productions of virtual environ-
ments and installations, mapping with motion capture and 3d laser
scanners, Buddhist philosophy and its relation to avatars and online
environments, and experimental choreography.

Alan recorded two albums for ESP-Disk' in the 60s which melded free
improvisation with electronic instrumentation.  His latest recordings have
been issued on Porter Records, Fire Museum & Qbico.

More about Azure Carter:

Azure Carter has been writing and performing her own songs for a number of
years; she also performs with Foofwa d'Imobilite and Alan Sondheim. Azure
is working on her own performances and sets, which are documented online.
She has appeared in a number of videos, and sings with Myk Freedman and
Alan Sondheim.

More about Myk Freedman:

Myk Freedman is a 29-year-old lap steel player, composer, arranger, and
band leader.  In 2003 he moved from Toronto to NYC to study music and
pursue the American Dream.  Since then, he has preformed with John Zorn,
William Parker, Elliot Sharp, Cyro Baptista and Kenney Wessel, as well as
with countless others.

Myk's compositions have been recorded by many of his own groups, as well
as by ensembles: The MK Groove Orchestra, In a China Shop and MARTIN &
HAYNES, a Toronto duo made up of Justin Haynes and Jean Martin who
released an entire record dedicated to his music entitled, FREEDMAN.  His
arrangements have been premiered at world famous venues such as The Blue
Note, John Zorn's The Stone, The Knitting Factory and the 2004 Distillery
Jazz Festival where he was nominated for the Emerging Artist Award.

As the leader of Saint Dirt Elementary School, Myk has released three
positively received albums on Canadian labels, Oval Window Records,
Barnyard Records, and Rat Drifting.  He splits his time between New York
and North York (Ontario) and is currently completing his second songbook
of fake folk music.

More about Secret Orchestra:

Secret Orchestra is an original group initiated by Clif Jackson in 2007
after the trio had already played together as a rhythm section in various
other projects.  It became apparent that they had a connection and shared
osme similar musical ideas.  However, they also brought their very
different backgrounds into the mix creating a strong dynamic and a wide
spectrum of musical space to play in.  Although Clif is the 'leader' of
the group and writes a lot of the music, he is the youngest member and
defers to the knowledge and experience of his elder band mates.  Yuko
contributes original compositions, as well, and they all contribute to
arrangements and aesthetics when appropriate.  Furthermore, improvisation
is at the center of their music, leaving all of them open to create their
own parts or to work within the composer's guidelines.  Through a mix of
composition and improvisation the overall musical aesthetic is grounded in
a sense of direction and an exploration of colors, textures, silence, and
rhythmic and melodic structures.

For Immediate release:
Printed in elegant, stapled editions, the inaugural chapbook series of
Lost & Found: The CUNY Poetics Document Initiative activates and puts
into wider circulation important but little known texts drawn from
personal and institutional archives.
An ongoing publication project emerging from archival and textual
scholarship done by students, faculty and guest fellows at the
Graduate Center, the primary focus of Lost & Found is on writers who
fall under the rubric of the New American Poetry. Since enhanced
accessibility to a broad spectrum of archival material helps create
alternative, divergent and enriched versions of literary and cultural
history, the Lost & Found initiative takes the =93New American=94 rubric
writ large, including the affiliated and unaffiliated, precursors and
followers. The first set includes correspondence, essays, and journal
selections:

Amiri Baraka & Edward Dorn: Selections from the Collected Letters
1959-1960, ed. Claudia Moreno Pisano, includes letters written between
1959 and 1960 and covers a wide-range of discussions, =93from quotidian
observations of being snowbound without enough heat...to the hashing
out of experiences, fears, and anxieties directly related to the
socio-political culture of the early 1960s=94.

The Correspondence of Kenneth Koch & Frank O=92Hara 1955-1956, Part I
and II, ed. Josh Schneiderman, includes =93letters [...] written over an
eighteen-month period from 1955 to 1956 [that] provide an account of
the poets=92 important, if often overlooked, friendship. Full of poems,
literary gossip, and nods to artistic influences, Koch and O=92Hara=92s
correspondence also chronicles a key moment in what would come to be
known as the New York School of poets=94.

Darwin & The Writers, Muriel Rukeyser, ed. Stefania Heim, is an
unpublished essay about Darwin (rejected by The Nation in 1959). =93The
piece is an exercise in the discovery, collection, and exposition of
=93meeting-places=94 between scientific and literary imaginations,
extending the intellectual work Rukeyser started in works like Willard
Gibbs and The Life of Poetry.=94

1957-1977 Selections from the Journals Part I and II, Philip Whalen,
ed. Brian Unger, is comprised of entries from Whalen=92s Journals from
two key periods in his life: the mid to late 1950s following the
public recognition of the Beats, and the early 1970s, after his return
from Japan and his decision to live in a Zen monastery.

The 1963 Vancouver Poetry Conference / Robert Creeley=92s Contexts of
Poetry, with Daphne Marlatt=92s Journal Entries, ed. Ammiel Alcalay, is
a Creeley lecture and conversation with Allen Ginsberg. Contexts of
Poetry is from the landmark 1963 Vancouver Poetry Conference, with
excerpts from the journals of the prominent Canadian poet Daphne
Marlatt, chronicling her attendance as a student.

Together, the set marks an auspicious beginning to a project that
brings the finest traditions of small press publication and textual
scholarship to a broader reading public.

We are delighted to announce that the chapbooks are available at
bookstores across the nation, from St. Marks Books to City Lights.

Books may be ordered online at
www.centerforthehumanitiesgc.org/lostandfound where they are on sale
for $10 per issue, $35 per set, and $25 per subscription. On Monday
and Tuesday, May 3rd and 4th, 10 a.m.=978 p.m., the set of chapbooks
will also be available for purchase at the Center for Humanities=92
Annual Chapbook Festival. Look for the Lost & Found table. More
information and a schedule for the festival are available at
www.chapbookfestival.org.

The Iowa Review on the Web has been around for at least the past dozen
years.

The last issue I can find is from 2008
http://research-intermedia.art.uiowa.edu/tirw/vol9n2/

It began as a *parallel* web version, one less competitive to get into, but
with a similar aesthetic to the print version.  Later on, it morphed into a
publication which featured "electronic literature" (with varying degrees of
success), "TIR-W."

However, it is apparently just gone, with a redesign and a new editor for
the TIR portion.

Hi all -=20

http://www.h-ngm-n.com/s_bmissions/
=20
Our first full-length book is actually a reissue of William Heyen's long ou=
t of print 1981 volume LORD DRAGONFLY.  The book has new notes by the autho=
r=2C a critical appreciation by Matthew Henriksen (which first appeared onl=
ine in Octopus) & a new memoir-ish kind of thing by me.  It'll be out in Ju=
ne.
=20
We're taking pre-orders for the book now & I'd really appreciate you thinki=
ng about getting a copy - something especially to think about if you're aff=
iliated with a university/library/poetics collection:

There is a nearly hour long interview with Patti Smith conducted by Amy Goo=
dman on Democracy Now tv today--i'd highly recommend it
Patti Smith has a new book out which focuses on her lifelong friendship wit=
h Robert mapplethorpe: in the interview she speaks esp. re their early year=
s in NYC=2C living in the Chelsea Hotel=2C his foto of her for her first LP=
 etc
she also speaks of her activism and songs for the Palestinian people and at=
 greater length re a teen-aged boy=2C a German Muslim Turk=2C imprisoned fi=
ve years in Guantanamo for "reasons" based on a string of accidental circum=
stances-
a book which had a huge effect on me as a teenager (and ever since)had a si=
milar effect on Patti Smith when she discovered it by chance=2C also as a t=
eenager--
Angel Fores' Anthology of French Poetry: from Nerval to Valery--when the bo=
ok was republished twenty five or so years later=2C Patti Smith wrote a ver=
y inspiring introduction re her discovery of the book and its effects on he=
r life=2C writing=2C music-
it's an Anthology i can't highly enough recommend
as people familiar with her work know=2C her second album=2C Radio Free Eth=
iopia=2C is basically dedicated to and heavily influenced by Arthur Rimbaud=
=2C his life and works
i think of Patti Smith as a figure on the line of what the Japanese call a =
National Treasure--through her poetry=2C music=2C activism and contribution=
s to the Punk ethos and performance=2C she has had a huge impact worldwide =
and is an examplar of the kind of artist most needed in times like these=2C=
 in which so many American poets and artists have turned their back on invo=
lvement with anything controversial=2C which is to say=2C the basic issue o=
f human rights for all persons and a sense of Shelley's call for poets acti=
ng and creating as indeed the unacknowledged legislators of the world-
thank you to Patti  Smith and Amy Goodman for the inspiring and often hilar=
ious interview--do tune in-

Dearest Peeps, So the guy Sina is up against is getting votes from his very large paid-for-blogging audience (via Twitter @writersdigest x 43,000 followers, no lie).  He gets paid to blog there.   Sina Queyras blogs during her own personal time about literature, esp poetry, without expecting pay.  She's a good blogger, selfless and interesting.  The voting ends at midnight.  Please consider dropping in and clicking her name? If you do and let me know, I'll send you a weird-o poem for your efforts, assuming you even want such a thing.  Yes, I'm blatantly attempting to ply you.  But poem or no, Sina deserves the recognition, in my humble estimation, so go there now -- and thanks lots! http://bloggingpoet.squarespace.com/bloggingpoetcom/vote-for-the-2010-poet-laureate-of-the-blogosphere.html Amy

Subject:      globe & mail books blog; poetry month,

All April, thanks to Judith Fitzgerald and Peter Scowen, Ive been curating
twenty spaces on the Globe & Mail book blog, asked for poets to write on
other poets. The suggestion on the Globe site is deceptive: I didnt pick
any of the subjects (but for mine, obviously), but asked twenty writers of
poetry to write on whomever they chose. Over the weeks, some were forced
to drop out for various reasons, unable to complete the task, and even
further were asked (originally I wasnt planning on writing any at all, but
somehow managed to write two, which wasnt my intention). It was pretty
entertaining, the idea of including all sorts of writers who might
otherwise not be allowed a Globe & Mail anything (where have all the
poetry reviews gone? Why doesnt the Focus section write on poets more
often? Etc) Thanks to all the writers who contributed magnificent pieces
(there were days when twenty weren't nearly enough)! Heres the entire list
of pieces back;

Hi Everyone,

I'm writing to announce that the William Bronk - Charles Olson corresponden=
ce has been republished-among a huge amount of sumptuous literary material =
in the new issue of Otoliths (number 17, just out, here: http://the-otolith=
.blogspot.com/.  (This correspondence can still be obtained from Ralph Maud=
 who edits the Minutes of the Charles Olson Society, and the hard copy issu=
e of the Minutes contains reproductions of some of the letters written by h=
and.)

In case you are interested in Bronk's work, let me mention that, also in th=
is issue of Otoliths, there is a reproduced essay of mine on the William Br=
onk - Robert Meyer correspondence (which originally appeared in The Body of=
 This Life: Reading William Bronk, ed. David Clippinger; Talisman House, Pu=
bliishers, 2001). As well, there is in the issue an intro essay on what it =
was like to edit Bronk's letters, those that I did (which is appearing for =
the first time).

You might wish to go directly here, to the special section on Poet-Editors,=
 curated by Eileen Tabios, who asked forty-three such poets "What is (or ha=
s been) your favorite editing project and why?":

http://the-otolith.blogspot.com/2010/04/poet-editors-front-page.html

Here's the list of other contributors to Eileen's section (lifted as is fro=
m the website):
