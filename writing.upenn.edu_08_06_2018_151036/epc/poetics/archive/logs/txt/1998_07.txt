Bob,
    In light of recent discussions here about the political impact of
poetry, could you give some more information or ask Clemente for
further background.

You see, differance is a file or array; you see, it's not the subtle wisp
of cloud caressing the moon, gone before your aware-ness (mono no aware)
catches up with you... Nikuko would write the difference with the edge of
the brush; back erect, shodo following breath upon the horizontal page.
But here, she'd say, were she next to me, hands on shoulder, lips lightly
brushing the erect back, it's a question or answer of five strings, well-
defined, pure information which only happens to appear in this or that
font, of this or that size, bold or italic or underline, or any other de-
fault setting the subject might predispose herself to reading within. She,
subject-Nikuko, turns back to the brush. Kanji is not always a question or
problem of difference, however subtle; it is also a memory. Isn't every
alphabet. Only to the extent that bandwidth reduces to the twenty-six, and
then further to the two, harbored against the one. Always coherent, the
two, Nikuko said; it's literally bound that way. One swallows the other.
Moon, fogging.

poets in some parts of North America DONATE copies of their works,
gratis, to [libraries]

I understand poets do this. They receive their copies from publishers.
In your experience as a publisher is this your suggestion?

Some publishers use their time and resources to manifest materials for
causes they consider to be of value. Having our publication sold to
libraries has played a part in achieving this aim.


The inevitable consequence

I think of this poet and Joe Bruchac and how much work they have done
for poetry whenever I hear of people patting themselves on the back and
telling others what to do when they haven't done the action themselves.
The anthology _House of the Dead_ edited by Joe Bruchac and William
Witherup changed my life because it opened up the realm of possibilities
as both a writer and editor.

I didn't read the Pinsky piece as being so much about jobs for poets as much
as only slightly papered-over union busting. Either that or he is incredibly
naive about what public school districts, especially in underfunded urban
areas, would do if they could hire employees with no formal training. For
every posh prep school that hires MFAs to enrich already well-funded programs,
there are 10 neo-Christian fundamentalist home church type environments that
use the same approach to provide who knows what in the name of education. If
you want inner city schools that look even more like concentration camps, his
proposal would be one quick way to get there. I found this to be a most
curious use of the laureate-ship indeed.

David, let this be your reality check.

>I understand poets do this. They receive their copies from publishers.

Most poets PAY for the printing and binding of their works. They also PAY
for any promotion of their works, such as advertising. They get nothing for
nothing, in most instances. Few poets actually get published and paid for
publishing.
Most poets also pay all their own expenses to go to readings, unless someone
passes the hat and takes up a collection. It is hardly a step up from
begging on the streets as usually it does not pay for dinner and gas for out
of towners.

At least that is how it is in Canada. I assume similarly in the United States.

>In your experience as a publisher is this your suggestion?

Actually I self published one book, and a couple of pamphlets. All of it
poetry, and all of it was 90% give-away, rather than gaining any revenue.

>Witherup changed my life because it opened up the realm of possibilities
>as both a writer and editor.

Ah, you are a censor. I lacked an experienced censor, to tell me what to
include and what to leave out, when I self published mine, so I failed at
it. A lesson for others who too fearlessly attempt that path. I would
counsel any that they need 1). an experienced censor
     2). an experienced mass marketer
     3). an experienced agent / public relations person
     4). a mass advertising capability
     5). an economical mass distribution system
     6). to know, or know an agent or publisher who knows well and personally
         a large enough number of book reviewers and editors

All of those factors are _essential_ and all of them will be rubbed in one's
face as essential and unavailable to self publishers. None of them are
optional if we are talking about anything that even resembles _real_
"success". That ought to do it, in most instances, as to making publication
of a title reasonably "successful" as to any significant "market share" or
even as to recovery of costs put into it.

The alternative is for another publisher who has turned a profit and
survived at it, to invite one to dinner. It is traditional to go with holes
in one's own pockets. In the give and take of it all one has to learn to
take one's defeats with some elements of grace and style. That's about all
there is to it. It actually happened, and the small press publisher and I,
remain friends despite having given our nod to custom and tradition. Anyway,
that happens when oneself is deceased as publisher, having failed to thrive.

My experience at self publishing cost me some thousands of dollars, so as to
have some poetry in print to give away. That was not the original intention,
but that is how it ended up. Not to even begin to add in the amount of hours
put into writing, typesetting, producing, and getting it out there. I will
recover my postage costs, due to a government of Canada program, that pays
authors a small fee based on how many copies of their books are found on the
shelves in random sampled Canadian libraries. Only the postage for some give
aways.

Lessons are always expensive, and some lessons more expensive than others.

Many thanks, Taylor, for the announcement.
It will be a really interesting reading--
In her recent posting Wendy referred to Arp--part of the Dada group in
Zurich around War I--
We did a reading of one of his sound poems, years ago in the Electronic
Poetry Workshop--also a multilingual poem read by Ray Federman, Ron
Hauser and me. Bill whistles and horns included.  Lots of fun.
Cheers

Below is something else about the Yamanaka un-award.  For more on the haole and
multiethnic in Hawaii, people might like to read *Ono Ono Girl's Hula* by
Carolyn Lei Lanilau (U of WI, 1997).  After getting a job that she didn't want
in a cannery: "Shock, denial, genuine nightmare is how I felt when the lady
grinded out 'Report to work tomorrow' in the pidgin tone, go-to-hell
enthusiasm.  While it is my habit to analyze a situation which appears
irrational, I now realize that at that moment, I embraced Language Poetry"
(35-36).


Dear Writer:


        I am writing to inform you about a situation of concern regarding Asian
American writers and the Association of Asian American Studies.  This
situation centers around the work of Lois-Ann Yamanaka and the decisions
of the AAAS literary awards committees and the Board of the AAAS.
Ultimately, I think it also concerns the complexity and freedom of our work, the
need
for an understanding of how literary works function, and a tribal policing for
“political correctness” which has characterized a certain part of the way
members of the AAAS have regarded the work of Asian American authors.

        In November 1996, Jinqi Ling (UCLA), Sau-ling Wong (UCB) and
Traise Yamamoto (UCRiverside) were asked to serve on the literary awards
committee for the 1997 Asociation of Asian American Studies conference to be
held in
Seattle. The committee was be responsible for reading fiction and poetry
published in 1996.  In February of 1997, the committee selected Lois-Ann
Yamanaka’s
Wild Meat and the Bully Burgers  to receive the AAAS book award.  Jinqi Ling,
the Chair of the committee, wrote up a letter announcing their decision.

        Subsequently, certain AAAS Board members objected to the committee’s
decision.  Apparently, no one was objecting to Wild Meat  itself; rather the
objection was based on the fact that Yamanaka’s previous volume, Saturday Night
at the Pahala Theater,  a 1994 AAAS award winner, had contained poems which some
regarded as offensive to the Filipino American community or as protraying
Filipino Americans in an unfavorable and stereotypical way. This sentiment was
voiced by other AAAS members, including the Filipino Caucus. Eventually, the
board voted to pull the award.  As I understand it, no public announcement was
made recording the judges’ decision and the overturning of that decision.

        In 1998, the Board appointed another literary award committee--Caroline
Chung
Simpson (chair), David Eng (Columbia) and Wendy Ho (UC Davis).  They chose
Lois-Ann Yamanaka’s Blu’s Hanging as this year’s award winner.  Again a
protest has started up.  Apparently, at this year’s AAAS conference in Hawaii,
there will be a discussion of Yamanaka’s work and the controversies surrounding
it.

        One of the Board Members to vote against the award in 1997, was
Dr. Jonathan Okamura (UH), the only member from Hawaii.  In a Hawaiian
publication,
Honolulu, Okamura said, “I and other board members objected because of
Yamanaka’s continued stereotyping of Filipinos.”  In the same article,
though, Okamura admited that his complaint was not necessarily with Wild Meat,
which he said he had never read, but with Yamanaka’s third and latest book,
Blu’s Hanging.  “In Blu’s Hanging, she equates Filipinos with rats and depicts
them as oversexed,” said Okamura, who pointed out that he had not read Blu’s
Hanging either, but did thumb through it looking for passages he felt maligned
Filipinos.

        Nowhere in Okamura’s response was there any consideration of the
fact that the speaker in the poems he objected to was a character and not the
author or to the fact that Blu’s Hanging  is not an autobiographical work or
personal essay but a work of fiction narrated by a fictional character.  In
other
words, with both works, views are attributed to the author which are
actually those of a fictional character.  To read literary works with such logic

completely misreads the way literarary works create a complex and
multi-voiced picture of the world and would shackle authors in any number of
problematic ways.  For one thing, it implies that no characters or narrators
should
espouse anything other than politically correct views.

        All this does not mean that I do not think that authors should be
protected
from criticism of their work.  Nor do I feel that one needs to agree that
Yamanaka has succeeded aesthetically in all aspects of her work or that one
cannot critique the portrayal of Filipino American’s in her work.  But I am
disturbed by Board member Okamura’s refusal to read Yamanka’s work and
his misunderstanding of the literary enterprise, and I question his
qualifications
to judge individual literary works and his understanding of the writer’s
enterprise (I can only wonder if other Board members displayed similar
tendencies in their reasoning).  I am even more disturbed by the process
through which the AAAS literary awards committee’s decision has been
overturned and may be again.

        I am writing other writers and organizations and asking them to
protest the AAAS Board’s refusal in 1997 to recognize the decision of its own
literary awards committee and to urge that such an action does not take place
again in 1998.   Those who oppose Yamanka’s work and her receiving the award
have
and are continuing to lodge their own views with the board.  The other side
need to be heard.

Letter to the Board of the Association of Asian American Studies


1)      I wish to protest the AAAS Board’s decision in 1997 to ignore
the choice of its 1997 literary awards committee to give a book award to
Lois-Ann
Yamanka for Wild Meat and the Bully Burgers.  I also urge the Board to recognize

the decision of its literary awards committee to give a book award to Yamanaka’s

Blu’s Hanging  in 1998.

2)      I am concerned too with a reading of Yamanaka’s work which
ignores or misreads the way a fictional character or narrator functions in a
literary work.

3)      I also wish to reaffirm that writers often must, by the nature
of their enterprise, upset and question prevailing views, evoke extreme and
visceral reactions, and write in ways where ambiguity and complexity take
precedence over “political correctness” or safe and comforting portraits of the
world, our community, or the individuals who reside there.

4)      I am also concerned with the way the AAAS has sometimes seemed
to organize “witch hunts” against various writers.  This is not to say that
writers
should be immune from criticism.  Indeed, criticism is a necessary part of the
creation of a literary culture.  Perhaps, though, it might be helpful for people
to look into the mechanism and psychological reasons why those within a
community wish to tear someone from the community apart once they have become
successful.   Rather than encouraging literary variety and creativity and
recognizing the difficulty of the tasks which writers and other artists perform,
the AAAS seems at times to have been attempting to invoke comformity and
silence.


        Sincerely,

I cannot speak for most poets as I am not most poets.

I can say that every book our press has published has paid its authors
in copies plus a cash amount. The industry standard in small press
publishing is 10 to 15% of press run usually paid in copies, we do a
little better. If vanity publishing were the industry standard wouldn't
it be called industry standard? Eh?

>Witherup changed my life because it opened up the realm of possibilities as both a writer and editor.

I am talking about reading an anthology edited by these individuals and
taken from writers "from the streets" who ended up in prison because of
what they had to do to survive or would be writers who never thought
they could be one. And how it expanded the realm of the possible for a
guy like me. I have no idea where your censor comment came from, perhaps
your unfamiliarity with the subject of Bruchac, et tal.

"to know, or know an agent or publisher who knows well and personally a
large enough number of book reviewers and editors. All of those factors
are _essential_ and all of them will be rubbed in one's face as
essential and unavailable to self publishers."

In NY state small press editors are given a chance through the NYState
arts council to do a learning process where a larger press donates their
time to mentor a smaller press and show them the ropes in all of the
areas mentioned above. In Philadelphia, individuals such as Gil Ott
(Singing Horse), Valerie Hanson (Boulevard), Ethel Rackin (APR), were
willing to do the same if you sought them out. Journals are also willing
to do the same if you donate your time to them.I was unaware that
presses weren't willing in Canada to do the same for the good it would
bring the community of writers in the particular area you speak of.

Be well

David,

What do you mean by "a panel situation?"....

In any event, i always try to hedge my enthusiasm with a certain number of
qualifiers..There are *definitely* libraries out there (academic and
public) where attempts to introduce half-way decent poetry (my phrase for
poetry outside the workshop mainstream) would be resisted or flatly
repulsed.  But a larger number where it would be met with interest and
responsiveness.

Perhaps your past experience is with some of the resistant strain...

But there is this:  your phrasing above makes it sound like you may have
been dealing with poetry mags....Now this is a trickier situation.  I
always encourage people to try with book acquisitions, because changing
the patterns of a library with respect to periodicals is often *much*
harder.  This may be part of the problem you've encountered.  Periodicals
represent an ongoing commitment, and in this day and age when capitalist
crisis and extremely right-wing fiscal agendas have trashed most
libraries' budgets, it is very hard to get them to consider new serials
commitments, unless they are certain a substantial number of their patrons
are going to use the title in question....Also, poetry mags as we all know
don't follow the strict publication patterns of commercial periodicals,
for the most part, and for a variety of reasons violate the expectations
and work-habits of library serials departments; and this tends to make it
a harder sell.

Starting out with books is easier.

Dear List,

I have been watching the string of postings concerning the protest of
Lois-Ann Yamanaka's recent award, based on what apparently were interpreted
as racist views of hers.

As I am watching this conversation unfold, I cannot help but wonder if i
missed something somewhere along the way when so much attention was given
to the genius of Maya Angelou, without regards to her - dare I say- OVERTLY
racist viewpoints.  I have heard Dr. Angelou (though I hate to call her
that, since the degree is an honorary one, and not an academically earned
one) speak on several occasions, and EVERY time she has lectured she has
addressed the audience (which for some reason is always almost entirely
white middle-to-upper-class) as if she were back in Stamps, Arkansas.

In her novels and poetry, the word "black" is always capitalized, while the
word "white" is never, and her views are almost bordering on rhetoric (to
say it lightly).  yet nobody ever says a word about it...why now all the
attention concerning the recent award for Yamanaka's poetry???  What sets
her up for the chopping block, when ever more severe examples of racism in
literature are allowed to pass us by without note???


Another poet, American, citizen sick of the "race" issue,

Great to read the whole of Padgett's tender stroll and Miller's pierced screed
in a sitting! I'd give Padgett a 9.8 and Miller a 9.7 because I'm just back
from the Slam at Chelsea Feast (507 W. 23, NY, NY, 10001) where Beau Sia hosts
'em every Tuesday at 8.

Padgett is the clearest writer I've ever met. So, how does he get clearer?
Amazing. And Miller pounds away at the inside out, making it public, always
has, and it's a mess, still. But we've got the Supreme Court voting aesthetics
now, huh? and he makes me look where I don't wanna see. Thomas Salia blech.

I, too, am proud of my poetry reading vet stripes. Many of the crowd at last
night's Slam (average age: 20) will go on to: Readings. This is a "good"
"thing." They do not go to readings now; the raucous commotion churns is what
they want. Too young to "drink," must poetry be denied them? Matt Levy (18
y.o.)  was featured --his zine "Schemantiks" is a hoot -- TipoDeSol@aol.com.
He won a high school poetry contest this year -- will be taking his $10,000
scholarship prize at Emerson in the fall.

As for the historicity of slam, it's clear enough at Kurt Heintz's site:
http://www.tezcat.com/~malachit/slam/. If anyone has some deeper interest,
lemme know.

It's an energizing marvel to find Pinsky on OpEd. We need the word careening
top down, too. Poet Laureate on date with First Lady -- great! Kenny Carroll,
DJ Renegade, and Nancy Schwalb getting props -- totally great. None has MFA
however. And institutions like T&W and PITS and WritersCorp need support.

Alliance between MFA and Slam via Poets in Schools programs to get art in and
voices out of middle and high schools is the platform.

Amen to Ron's post!  The idea of using non-certified MFAs to teach in
public schools could be seen as a serious attempt to errode the teachers
unions' bargaining units. Likewise, it appears to me that the "more bang
for your buck" theory of education would work just like the ethically
questionable practice of hiring adjuncts and one-year contracts, etc.,
that is all the rage in most universities and colleges.  It's just a way
to hire people for very little money, offer them no job security, and then
work their asses off because they are so pleased to get a chance to be in
front of a classroom.

I also find it curious that no one has mentioned any of the slam poets who
ARE high school or middle school teachers.  Daniel Faery of the Berwyn
team and Taylor Mali (who did teach at one time--I'm not sure he still
does) immediately come to mind. There is also Michael Brown, who is a
professor at Mount Ida College in Boston.

This might be a bit naive on my part, but it seems clear to me that
the qualities that make one a good teacher would also make one a good slam
poet--enthusiasm, eloquence, and the ability to make you think about
something in a new way.  Of course, not all slam poetry does this.  But,
then again, not every teacher does either.

(1) bob holman makes a convincing case for the value of slams, whatever you
think of them... the only danger of course is that folks come out of slams
expecting ALL poetry to do thus & so in terms of oral performance... but
worth the risk to get the word out, i think, and to contribute to the
flows... btw:  is it true that both slams and bouts had their origins in
chicago?... i've heard marc smith go on about slams... in any case, this
makes the cultural-historian-hobbyist in me wanna ask what is it about
chicago that cultivates same?... broad shoulders?...

(2) i agree with ron and julie on the union issues, being mself prone
toward collective bargaining... somehow it sounds like pinsky just wasn't
thinking... but julie:  i'm not sure i'd make that correlation between
performance and teaching quite so strong...

(3) brent long:  "Another poet, American, citizen sick of the 'race'

angelou's poetry mself, but that's quite beside the point it seems you're

RE: these:

Yes: the "academics" could lovingly learn from these children. (As we
all can.) Having taught at both the college level and now at the middle
school level--I prefer the middle school. As a poet the language comes
as primary source--thus the language is put primary--as primer--more so
in middle school (for my exp.) than at the art college I taught at. The
children do like "odd" poems because the children can be allowed to love
and engage language. The notions (all "language" "marxist" "post marx"
"post mod." "confessionals" "blah blah blah" mean beautiful NOTHING to
the children. When we read they want to know about LIFE and the
LANGUAGE. Allowing a reading text to be smart for middle schoolers is
also a joy. I've put together readings specific to my writing workshop
that were filled with Ashbury, Baraka, Lyn Hejinian, Celan, Rumi,
Dickinson, Whitman, Hughes, Creeley, Duncan, even Silliman (only the
"even" cause these kids are 11-14!) and they've "gotten" them all.

A discussion the other day with Diane Ward: she mentions that her son's
4th grade teacher did a poetry "section" and that all the poems were
directed toward that notion that "this equals that" --as if the poems
had to HAD TO be a direct relationship to the living everyday. Iused to
be 6...now I'm 9.." etc. In my workshops I often stress SOUND as
Meaning, Meanings as Sound, etc. I would argue that these kids get
poetry in a way that refreshes MY ear and continually gives me energy.
My other (personal, obviously) exp. at the academic level often showed a
death and dearth of care towards the poem and a much more elevated level
of "grasping at ..." . I guess I just like kids!

Everyone should have a go at the experience of teaching/writing with
children. You'll find out what you really believe in a vastly rhetorical
manner.

Todd --

It sounds like Diane Ward's child's teacher was using Kenneth Koch's book
_Wishes, Lies & Dreams_, and was not giving very inspiring examples (if
lines like "I used to be six but now I'm nine" were what the teacher was
getting -- unless there was some Hendrix playing in the background?). I'm
surprised to see those lessons criticized for overdependence on the world
of things; when the book came out, many (including Teachers & Writers
stalwart Phillip Lopate) saw Kenneth's exercises as too much promoting the
surreal among children, the fear being that kids would detach from
reality. Oh well! people always will complain about the atmosphere.

Incidentally, Ted Berrigan and Bruce Andrews have both used the "used to
.. but now" exercise in their work.

I actually meant "non-rhetorical" way. But hey!

ps: the fiction  and drama I teach in my English courses at the same 7th
grade level is also a joy and a stretch for the kids: N. Mahfouz,
Fugard, Alan Paton, Borges, Allende, etc. Certainly a stretch for a 12
year old--but a stretch they intend to met because we allow (not ask or

Just to state the obvious:

Without being a fan of Dr. Angelou, nothing you say Brent indicates
racism on her part.  The issue of reverse racism is a long debated one
among white hysterics who love to react to the issue of "P.C."  Racism
is an issue of institutional domination, which despite her honorary
degree, Dr. Angelou does not, will never, possess.  See how easy it was
for you to place her "back in Stamps, Arkansas."

Furthermore it is never a simple accidental/coincidental "reason" why
the audience is always almost entirely white middle-to-upper-class.
Check out the June 21 NYSlime article on the reorganiziation of private
college aid which favors just the abovementioned folk.

as for her views, rhetoric, poetry--no need for me to defend them, her
political use of capitalization a racist make her?  please please now.

That is rare to non existent in Canada. At least in Southern Ontario, and as
far as I know throughout the country. Here the full cost must be paid by the
author, for everything. Including any mail out of copies by the publisher,
at an extra cost, to institutions and/or reviewers. That is the standard
here for authors who are not established, and do not have a relatively long
string of successful titles behind them.

A short run of poetry books, perfect bound, here, simply printed, costs in
excess of $1500. That is cost to the author. Chapbooks, in short run
printings, and of a few dozen pages tend to cost around $250 to $500 stapled
depending on the size of the press run.

Any promotional expenses extra. Postage extra.

It is considered alright to pay for publishing all those titles, though.
It is _never_ referred to as 'vanity publishing'.

It is also considered alright to finance any amount of self promotion, if
one has the ability, the know how, the connections, and the money to do it.
There are no restrictions on that either, but free promos usually only go to
people who have paid for some promos in the past. To pay for promo also pays
for insurance, in some places, against negative publicity. It is somewhat
alike to the mob. You pay us, for getting not much of anything, so we do not
break your kneecaps. Some of media here works exactly that way. Not all, but
some. Keep the money rolling out of your pocket, or die. (Not quite literary
payola, but not that much different, and you have to know who to give money
to, but you quickly do learn that most of what appears to be friendship has
a price. Rare exceptions to that.)

One almost _has to be_ a national award winning, laureled poet, to get a
publisher to pick up the costs of publishing. Very few exceptions. Even
national award winners, after winning the nation's most coveted literary
award, tend to do a reading circuit in small cafes, pubs and libraries, with
a bag of volumes that they have to peddle themselves as would a door to door
salesman. Enough, successful, self publishing can win a significant award,
but often a factor in that is how much money was invested into publication.
Three colour litho covers get a lot more points scored than do one colour
letterpress or offset covers. So self publishing authors are encouraged to
put money into their cover design and printing, on their second attempt, if
they financially survive their first meagre effort.

We do not question it. It simply is our cultural life here. It is how it is.

It is a nation of chapbooks, mostly unadvertised to the mass market, and
on consignment in a limited number of stores.

>If vanity publishing were the industry standard wouldn't
>it be called industry standard? Eh?

Perhaps that distinction makes sense in America, but here if one does not
have a relatively current, self-published book out, one does not get to read
at any worthwhile readings. The readings are controlled by a few people who
invite one of two kinds of people 1). people who have paid them money for
one or another service rendered and 2). people who have afforded to publish
books. Others are limited to the occassional open mic and to very tiny
audiences in most instances. The publishers control some of the better
reading venues, and are not reluctant to put poets to gunpoint extortion to
pay to publish if they want to read at readings. If you cannot afford it
then read to your own four walls is usually the answer.

I would never spend as much as it takes to publish a book of poems on vanity.
It is simply not my nature to do so. I did spend it on it because I have
been writing poetry for a long time, and felt some of my poems might have some
merit as poems, as works of art, and be worthy of a literary audience's
interest and enjoyment.

I decided to compile such a book. I typeset the book. I arranged the pages
ready for press. Then when the book was ready to be printed, I thought
somewhat long and hard about how to dedicate it on that page that says
"to......". I chose an event, involving another person, that had had a
profound influence on some of my writing. Then I added those words and the
initials of the person, after the book was done.

The book was conceived when a local friend, a fellow poet, somewhat
encouraged putting something together. He had the established connections to
get me some readings, at least locally, IF I had a book. He did not ask me
to pay him to publish one. He only asked if I had a book so he could include
me where possible.

Then it went to the printer who had to be paid cash on the barrel.

Then I was allowed some slightly better readings, locally and in Toronto,
and invited to some others a little further afield, by another more
established poet. So it goes here. There were a few real, though small,
audiences. When the book runs its course, the question then becomes "do you
have another book out, yet ?" If the answer is yes, then it is possible to
schedule in to a few more readings.

>I am talking about reading an anthology edited by these individuals and
>taken from writers "from the streets" who............

It is nearly taken for granted in Canada that nearly every artist, writer,
poet, MUST have another vocation and a paying job to support their own
artist. There is nearly zero tolerance for artists financing their work from
anything else.

At one time some artists used to collect welfare so as to have some time to
work on their art. It was only a few, and they often were disfavoured
otherwise for doing so, but now welfare recipients are given workfare jobs
to do and that practice is much more difficult, if not impossible. Now some
try to go insane and collect disability. Personally I prefer to avoid those
means by no means, and cannot speak for any others.

I consider my "press" bankrupt and closed down.

There is nothing of that kind, as far as I know, in Canada.
Even if there were, in one way or another, it would cost a huge amount of
money.
Most people cannot afford that.

There was a local program of business mentoring and a little financial
assistance during startup, but they were totally uninterested in anything
to do with the arts, and would not supply mentoring to any arts oriented
venture. An advertising business, doing advertising for other businesses,
run by someone who has connections enough to do that, would have been
applauded and taken on, but someone who has scrounged dollars to publish a
book of
poems, was of no economic interest to anything of that kind.

There is no other money or other assistance available for anyone who is
not "established" in the arts. To know the right people one must be
established, and to be established one must know the right people.

Chicken and the egg.....

The yolk was on me. I thought I could finance my own art, on the basis of
the product returning the costs, while financing myself on the basis of
a full working day at a non arts job. It does not work that way. At least
not here....So tell me, how does it work there ?

if the authors pay for everything, are the publishers really publishers,
or would it be more accurate to call them printers?  if i write a book i
can call mcnaughton&gunn in michigan and have them print as many copies as
i can pay for.  but this is far different from sending a manuscript to a
publisher and hoping they like it enough to print it.

        I sympathize somewhat with your points; it is often
a little distasteful to see artists such as Dr. Angelou (in
my case, Dolores Kendrick) with an obvious race "agenda"
gaining so much noncritical adoration from the very institutions
that she criticizes. And the artists, god bless 'em, often
aren't very nice people anyway. This dynamic shows up in arenas
other than race, of course; writers with a distinct "feminist",
"class based", regional, (&c...) stance often fail to translate
their aesthetic positions into action. It's wonderful to admire
writers such as Rich who manage to keep their politics "correct",
but important to note that it's not a requirement for good art.

        I do agree with Rachel, though. The entirely media
induced hysteria about "reverse discrimination" has been ungracefully
gracing the back pages of Time magazine for years now, and it seems
that even George Will is getting tired of complaining from Conneticuit.
While I'm not a fan of Angelou, I do love, say, Morrison's work, which is
all so full of "racist" violence; do you have the same problem, Brent,
with her work? _Paradise_, _Jazz_...?

One of the few, I guess. Race is forever a part of American life
in a way that it will never be (hopefully) for any other nation.
Some of the great work of America is generated out of "the race
issue", if that's what you want to call Faulkner's muse. Gould
may point out that biologically speaking, race does not exist, but
as a cultural and aesthetic entity, it's here to stay.

Because nobody's tying up white people and dragging them behind
pickup trucks. Because I turned on the shortwave this morning and
heared the BBC World Service interviewing the KKK at a demonstration
in Texas. Even if it weren't for the fact that whites in America have
held the "language privilege" for years. I don't believe Yamanaka's
work (fiction, not poetry, I believe) should be censored, but it's
a totally different question there, where the writer may be taking
cheap shots at racial group that can't respond because Y holds an
position of economic power.

Simon (and list),

I do not see the similarities between Morrison's work (with the exception
of _Paradise_) and Angelou's.  However, I do resent the implication from
rachel (who has never met me) that I am a "White Hysteric".  I do not even
need to defend such a ridiculous blanket statement.  (I do, however, wonder
if she has ever read the correspondence between Hurston and Langston
Hughes, and whether or not that correspondence places Hughes in the "White
Hysterics" group right along with me...an ironic idea, don't you think?)

I do now see the difference between Y's stance and that of Angelou, and am
glad to have it stated as you have done.  Hopefully, now this can fade
out...old shit only stinks when you stir it...

Subject:      pinsky racism publishing squid

I read the Pinsky op-ed thing; the main thrust seemed to be the excitement
of the school visit, & the call for getting more poets working in schools,
plus a brief defense of the MFA system.  Rather than complaining about
the teaching certification system it might have been better to examine ways to
get more money to Poets in the Schools programs in order to pay the poets
more & get them more integrated into a regular curriculum.  This seems
like an achievable goal.  Plus instead of blaming the schools he might have
looked at MFA programs that integrate certification into the degree (if
there could be such a thing).

Racism? Ey, we'd all like to kiss it goodby.  But race (whatever blend of
skin-color, genealogy, culture) I think is going to be around for a while,
along with the history behind it & the present based on it - to say it's
not an "issue" is the ostrich option.  The Hawaii situation sounds
extremely charged & complicated.  I do think it's possible to read and
discern between a fictional narrator's attitudes and the general thrust
of an author's position.  And if an author denigrates a group of people
in their work then I have no problem with people politically protesting
a public award for it.  Whether that's actually the case with the author
in question I don't know!!  & it probably doesn't help to spread
rumor, second-hand info, & so on if you haven't read the work, especially
if you're one of the "judges"!  My sister by adoption, white mother,
Af-American father, lived in Hawaii for several years & loved it.  But
race is made an "issue" for her, every day - & not just in Hawaii.

On the state of publishing & so on - I don't think we've absorbed yet what
websites, micropublishing, and readings - the active combination of these
three - are doing to the audience for poetry & the process of what gets read
and circulated. It's sort of like mass market film versus indies.  But
websites & micropublishing have strengthened the hand of the indies, so it's
sort of an alternative to the big publishers, the grants, the awards...
or a DIFFERENT KIND of stepping stone for those writers aiming for a wide
public.  Maybe aiming is the wrong word.  But this indie world throws
groups, trends, celebrity, prestige, styles in a new light.  Maybe not as
big a change as Gutenberg but a similar KIND of change happening.
(this is po-biz not poetry, I guess).

Just one quick thought on this Angelou thing, don't want to get wrapped up
in it - I just question one of the premises w/ which this all began,
namely, that anyone in the Academy likes Maya Angelou's work.  I know
many, many Af-Am Lit & Studies people who don't think she's any good at
all and aren't interested in her work in the least, though they may not
say so publically (and indeed, why should they waste their time doing
so?).  In my interview w/ Harryette Mullen, she makes the interesting, and
completely sincere, comment that she believes Angelou's intended audience
is often adolescent girls, and should be contextualized as such.  Alright,
enough from me.  -m.

Dear Julie,

I haven't been following the discussion about Slams, but I know something
of its history, as one of my former students, Inka Alasade, was an
undefeated six-time champs (who retired to study linguistics at the
graduate level).  Also, the famed post-punk poet Lorri Jackson was my
student at Columbia College Chicago just before dying of a heroin overdose
at age 28 (Lorri was "performative" and read with Jim Carroll at the Cubby
Bear).  I just want to emphasize that the distinction between the slams
and the academic is complex and misunderstood, though that distinction was
very useful in helping to publicize the slams as a late "beat" phenomenon.
It's interesting to note that a number of the poets invited to appear as
headliners by slam organizer Marc Smith, such as Reginald Gibbons and
Marvin Bell, have long been associated with universities and, more
importantly, mainstream practice.  One night, the slam featured the poetry
of James Dickey!  Only Andrei Codrescu, of those in the tradition of New
American Poetry (Allen), appeared at the slam that I know of.  So there
was a gap between what the slams intended as a late Beat poetics and the
poetry they appeared to promote.  I'm not putting down the slams; they're
fine by me (now).  I'm suggesting that the town/gown difference is
complicated.  At one of the best-known slam locations, run by poet Michael
Warr, classes in how to write for performance (and to perform) have been
offered for years.  Does this suggest that the slams are becoming
academic or  simply culturally institutionalized?  One of the real
oddities of the late 80s and early 90s in Chicago was that I was speaking
against the slams (though I have long supported experimental practice and
included performance poetry  of the first two postwar generations in
Postmodern American Poetry) and the more conservative Reg Gibbons was for
them.  Go figure.  Hostilities were suspended by me incidentally just
before Maxine Chernoff and I moved to California.

   Hey, does anybody know if the Lorri Jackson posthumus collection
   ever came out. There was talk about it several years ago (the
   gentleman who edits the Chiron Review might have been involved),
   but I've lost track, and haven't heard anything......

Dear Joe Amato, et al:

One more thing about the history of slams.  Yes, the slams were founded by
Marc Smith at the Green Mill bar on Broadway in Chicago.  He took the
concept from Al Simmons, who now does the Taos Poetry Circus or whatever
it's called.  In the late 70s and early 80s, Al organized poetry
competitions along the lines of a boxing match.  Jerome Sala, who's
married to poet Elaine Equi and now lives with her in NYC, was by far the
outstanding performer of the time, Mayakovskian and punk.  Marc changed
the boxing metaphor to wrestling, and the rest is history.  Marc Smith
deserves a lot of credit as an impresario and also as a performer.  He's
tireless and energetic, and he stirred things up.  Those studying this
phenomenon might find it of interest that Baraka once spoke against slams
as commodification rather than a political force field, or something to
that effect.  Probably the energy behind it is the desire to get poetry
ready for the age of mass communications.  But those successful at
slamming, like Paul Beatty, always find a home on the page as well.

Yes, the posthumous Lorri Jackson book appeared.  It's called SCAT, 82 pp.
in ring-binder format.  The publisher is Oyster PUblications, P.O. Box
4333, Austin, TX 78765.  The same publisher has on its list MY MOUTH IS A
HOLE IN MY FACE by the same author. Can't give you the list price.  Very
much a small press publication, with cover art of a young woman sitting on
an exploding toilet.  The poems in the book include some earlier work that
I can remember from workshops, but overall the collection is too uneven
and doesn't serve Lorri very well.

Best,
Paul Hoover

Anything you can do to get wider funding for writers-in-the-schools
programs would be welcome, by the writers, the teachers, and the hassled
administrators .. most principals I know these days are more like
development officers (grant writers) than the clueless despots I remember
lumbering around. Poets in Public Service (formerly known as Poets in the
Schools; they changed their name when they noticed that PITS was kind of a
self-fulfilling acronym) isn't in business anymore, by the way. Send
people to Teachers & Writers (1-888-266-5789).

Right! Don't mean to sound like an ass-haole here--the author not only bears
the brunt for such criticism, but actually (and gladly) exchanges it for the
attention (notoriety?) that goes along with it. The award notwithstanding,
Yamanaka is getting a lot more out of this than anyone else (this is not a
criticism of her at all), and for that matter so is the panel, who get to
assert themselves. I mean that her name, her works will probably still stand
long after the judges, and panels (and their names) are forgotten. Or is our
concern here only for the NOW, the works throwaways?

yes--of course--but with children the realization that language need not
be tied to the everyday--or the "self" is very important. The idea of
generating a world with the word instead of reorting on it. I used
Koch's book--but don't generally use the exercises that stress formula.

I used to
but now I don't.

I too would  like to thank Julianna for making us aware of the controversy
surrounding Yamanaka.

I must admit, I'm rather taken by Yamanaka's work and I wonder--for those
of us who have read her--whether Yamanaka's books are not filled with a
questioning of many "perverted" sexualities.  In Saturday Night, I get the
sense that many of the Japanese Americans are also depicted as "oversexed"
or as having bizarre sexual affiliations.  Also, there seem to be Japanese
American characters taking shots at other Japanese American characters--on
racist terms--in the book.  I guess this kind of attack goes back to
Morrison's technique (or at least it seems related in my own mind) in The
Bluest Eye.  The "black people who hate black people" narrative as
evidence of self-hatred.  But in Yamanaka's case, the Japanese American
vs. Japanese American suggests a general sense of hating being Asian in
the general sense. The us vs. them is not, in my opinion, the us
of Japanese vs. the them of Philipinos.  But, again, I'm hesistant to take
position--am instead talking around the subject and am only following the
thread and wondering.

Also--any information on how Philipino/a writers have felt about this
controversy, specifically?  Jessica Hagedorn?  Alarcon?

I don't really understand how Pinsky's remarks on the MFA led to a debate
about teaching poetry in school, but i'd like to talk about my school's
programs.

First, at my school the MA is considered as good as a teaching certificate.  I
go to Mountain Brook High School, which has been twice named a Blue Ribbon
school and is overall very prestigious (though public).  The MA with
additional teaching experience yields an increase in one's paycheck.  I
suspect that the same goes for the MFA, so yes, some schools do take a degree
as a teaching certificate regardless of experience (of course, I think that
any school would much rather hire someone with classroom experience).

Secondly, we have a creative writing program.  The AP English teacher, Melinda
Cammarata, who used to teach at a local university, teaches it.  Last year
there were 10 students.  The class worked like this: every week for at least 2
days, we had a forum in which we read and commented on each other's work.  The
other three days we wrote or tossed ideas back and forth.  Every quarter, we
had requirements like "write a haiku, a short story, a dramatic monologue, and
a villanelle."  Most of us had to research at least one of those forms to
figure out what they were and how best to write one (for instance, I think
Collins' "The Story We Know" is better than Thomas' "Rage, Rage" (i'm not sure
that's the title)).  This left a lot up to the students.  We had to think for
ourselves, learn rules, forms, sound techniques, etc. on our own.  Those of us
who were concurrently taking AP english were lucky because in English class we
went through many time periods of poetry and learned a lot about
meter/sound/devices/etc.  The last quarter of Creative Writing was free-- we
were each to choose what forms we wanted to experiment with (although we had
been able to write whatever we wanted in the other quarters, we'd also had
form requirements... in the last quarter we set up our own requirements to
supplement our usual free writing).  We also had to do a project (one class
period presentation) highlighting one author, period, or style.  Some of the
projects done were Whitman, Dickinson, Dr. Seuss, John Grisham, and Kurt
Vonnegut (I did John Cage).  I think it was a very good program.

I think that one with an MFA could probably teach in just about any school as
long as there was a demand for a poetry (or creative writing) teacher.  Since
most schools probably would not want to pay for such frivolity when they can't
even afford math and english teachers, then it's not really a secure place to
be job-hunting.  However, I don't think that letting people with MFAs teach
would defeat bargaining claims amoung teachers or turn any school into a
"concentration camp" (i think the parallel drawn is immature, hyperbolic, and
disrespectful to the actual holocaust survivors, but that is another story
altogether).  As there are teachers who have MAs (or MFAs) who do not have
certificates or even hours, I don't think that other teachers are in much
danger of losing anything if someone with an MA gets a job.  The reason that I
disagree is that people with MFAs have a special talent and can fill a niche
that few "normal" teachers can.

Of course they are publishers.

They offer design, typesetting, artwork, coordination of the printing and
binding through subcontracts....and sometimes other services. They usually
offer a package price of so many dollars for so many copies printed. The
publisher often also puts out a catalogue and might arrange for distribution
via a distribution company. That is not always the case with short run,
short length chapbooks.

A printer only does the printing, and sometimes makes the printing plates.
Although some printers do offer creative services that do those other things.
I do not know any printers who put out catalogues or arrange distribution.

The issue, Jessica, is not what degrees your teachers have but whether they
are hired as low-paid non-union labor.
It's important to remember that before the Teacher's Union full-time
teachers were paid poverty-level wages. It was quintessential "women's
work," and women who were their own or their family's sole support were
regarded, conveniently, as anomalies.
You're certainly right, by the way, that few school systems, in the current
environment in which art and music programs are being eliminated, can
afford to fund a full-time creative writing teacher. My thought was that it
wouldn't be a terrible thing for folks with MFAs to work as regular
classroom teachers with special talents and training that they could bring
to their schools and students.
Participants in poets-in-the-schools type programs too often see themselves
as better than the regular teachers because their students are so
enthusiastic. They don't realize that the poetry class is like recess, for
students and teacher. Most of the serious work of the school gets done by
teachers who remain in contact with their students and community for many
years of full-time work. They may be more tired and less enthusiastic than
whatever dog-and-pony show the schools can get as freebies (because funding
doesn't usually come from the school's budget), but their investment in the
process is also much greater. Which might not be bad for a lot of otherwise
semi-employed MFAs to experience.
Incidentally, I've done my share of gigs as poet-in-school. My mother was a
fulltimer. I know the difference.

Dear Mark:

MFAs--you're right--it ISN"T a terrible thing to bring that to a regular
classroom. My MA was the terminal degree at New College and damn if the
teachers I work with with credentials/etc don't truly know squat about
literature--certainly not poetics--and turn to --even enlightened but
still--textbooks or others to tell them how to teach. This educational
system--private and public--needs good teachers--I agree --MFAs would be
a welcome sight--and of course--the money needs to reflect that those in
middle and upper schools REQUIRE a salary comparable to academics--that
ain't no bitter rose for me--I work 5 days a week from 7:30-3:30--love
it--and am tired and underpaid! Even at a private school! So--hey..phew!

Paul's a friend of mine--we met in grad school, where he was often attacked for
using what was actually referred to as "substandard" English in his poems. It was
suggested that he supply footnotes. Gregory Corso asked him if he played
basketball, Allen asked him if he had ever smoked crack.

Yikes!

The sentence was supposed to say, "Another poet who dislikes Angelou, knows race is
*not* biological..."

A word to the wise: if you format a word w/italics & bold print & yr message loses
its formatting in email translation, it may drop the word entirely.

What this person is saying is simply not true. In fact it is an enormous
distance from the truth. When I first saw the statement in an earlier post
I thought the source was the USA. I dont know who he is. I have never run
across his name outside this e-mail set. But I have been involved in Canada
as a poet, publisher and editor for many years. It would be hard to find a
publisher of poetry in Canada that does not pay the poets---unless one is
talking about a little local mimeo outfit somewhere.

Subject:      publish poetry?
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

I inadvertently deleted a message in which someone wondered, if poets are
paying for their publications, whether the publishers can legimately be
considered publishers, as opposed to "printers," or "book producers," or
something else.

I think every publisher is absolutely different. There is no standard for
the small press, for what makes a press a press, for what makes a publisher
a publisher. I used to think there was some ideal to live up to; I no
longer believe that.

Chax Press is nonprofit, and I'm the founder and executive director and one
member of the board of directors.. Technically that means, among many other
things, that the money to publish books is not supposed to come out of my
pocket, or pockets of members of the board of directors -- if too much
comes from any one source so connected with the press, we could get in
trouble with the IRS, as I understand it. Nevertheless, I have personally
managed to get thousands of dollars into debt because I have chosen to
publish poetry. As a result, in part of my own foolish commitments, less
books were published by the press from 1993-1997 than in the four years
preceding that. Only in 1998, for the first time in a long time, has Chax
managed to publish more than four books in a year, and that only because I
decided to make a commitment to publish managable chapbooks which are
elegantly made but which don't take a lot of money to produce. Chax has
been helped, at times during all of these years, yet increasingly in the
last five years, by author contributions to their own publications, by
author's friends contributions to publications, and by authors the press
doesn't even publish contributing to the overall work of the press. Chax
has also had a lot of contributions by non-authors, and several grants from
government and foundation sources. I've taken loans from people to publish
books, and these loans have been terribly difficult to pay back, but I'm
still working on it, for more years than I ever thought it would take. If
Chax had to pay for all book publications through grants and non-author
contributions, I do not think the press could still be publishing books. As
it is, there have been many times when I have thought that Chax should
return to the practice, pre-1990, of publishing only handmade limited
editions, and not venturing into the more commercial bookpublishing world
at all -- but so far I haven't made that decision.

So, is Chax a publisher? I got into this work primarily because I wanted to
make books by and to some extent with, poets -- to design them, to make
them by hand, and to help them get out to some readers. For most of the
now-14 years of Chax Press I have worked primarily on the bookmaking, book
design, and fundraising aspects of the work, and, extensively, with setting
up readings and residencies locally, something it's actually somewhat
easier to raise funds for (than for book publications). I've struggled more
at the promotion and distribution/sales parts of the work (but yes, Chax
has worked with distributors, has put out announcements and catalogues, put
up a web site, and more), roles which I know are essential but which come
much less naturally to me. It's difficult for me to choose to spend time
doing that work (no matter how important I know it is) rather than writing,
reading, bookmaking, or engaging myself with income-producing work outside
the press altogether. Chax has had limited success and non-success with
distribution, sometimes managing to sell a couple of thousand copies of a
book, sometimes struggling to sell a hundred copies of a book. I have not
paid authors in cash except for one instance more than a decade ago; I have
paid them in copies. I am still making difficult choices with each book in
terms of how to pay for it, while trying to honor the sequence of books, to
publish a book in the order in which its manuscript was accepted (something
which I usually, but not always, have been able to do); and trying to honor
words spoken or written to authors about when a book would come out
(something which, unfortunately, all too often I have not been able to do).

I'm quite comfortable if someone wants to think of Chax as a printer or
bookmaker (these are honorable sorts of work, in some ways less suspect
than the work of a publisher sometimes is) rather than as a publisher.
Mostly I just look at the work that is to be done, and try my best to do
it. Some days, weeks, months, and years, it works better than others. It
rarely, possibly never, works as well as I would like it to. On the other
hand, all of it still, after some years, seems worth doing.

So many (crytpo or no-so-crypto retrograde elements) these days speak as if
they were the very guarantors of (intellectual? aesthetic? political?)
freedoms...just about now (timely) when (oh the horror!) cultured "minorities"
(running rampant, afoot, closing in, locking up the gates, downright
oppressing your ass!) -- some of them not even "real" doctors at that! (the
horror, again, revealed!).. and that they dare strut around like that (as per
your words, Brent, "EVERY time").. still speaking like theys all.....   And
had Angelou..talked like a____ (how should she talk, to y'all, carnalito..what
wouldn't be ojectionable to you... tell us...

"Poet, American, Citizen".... generic right-wing shock-jock dismay at it
all....(but "poet" there added..very respectable indeed...)

The supposed "OVERTness" of Maya Angelou's "racism"...is a joke, ...especially
when you try to prove it by saying that she capitalizes the word Black and not
wHITE...Girlfriend! and if the opposite were true, what insidious strategy
(literarily, ideologically) would that reveal? ...whoa, but what a racist
Angelou is!   And Adrienne Rich, what a sexist! (by that very logic).......and
here comes the Class of 1848...pushing their (oh-so-pushy) class agenda...


I'm not going to give you a  "despite-my-differences-with-Angelou's
-political-outlook." (implied, I think, as too reformist) that other listees
posted (the spirit of that, however, appreciated) but rather, as you so baldly
collude with the right with your shoddy polemics, I'm going to give you an
("my") unconditional defense of Angelou against rightist genius...in the
spirit of a Untited Front.

Brent Long wrote "Dear List,

I have been watching the string of postings concerning the protest of
Lois-Ann Yamanaka's recent award, based on what apparently were interpreted
as racist views of hers.

As I am watching this conversation unfold, I cannot help but wonder if i
missed something somewhere along the way when so much attention was given
to the genius of Maya Angelou, without regards to her - dare I say- OVERTLY
racist viewpoints.  I have heard Dr. Angelou (though I hate to call her
that, since the degree is an honorary one, and not an academically earned
one) speak on several occasions, and EVERY time she has lectured she has
addressed the audience (which for some reason is always almost entirely
white middle-to-upper-class) as if she were back in Stamps, Arkansas.

In her novels and poetry, the word "black" is always capitalized, while the
word "white" is never, and her views are almost bordering on rhetoric (to
say it lightly).  yet nobody ever says a word about it...why now all the
attention concerning the recent award for Yamanaka's poetry???  What sets
her up for the chopping block, when ever more severe examples of racism in
literature are allowed to pass us by without note???

1. About the Poetics List=20

The Poetics List was founded in late 1993 with the epigraph above.=20

There are presently over 600 subscribers.=20

Please note that this is a private list and information about the list=
 should
not be posted to other lists or directories of lists. The idea is to keep=
 the
list to those with specific rather than general interests, and also to keep
the
scale of the list relatively small and the volume manageable.=20

The Poetics List, while committed to openness, is moderated. While=
 individual
posts of participants are sent directly to all subscribers, we continue to
work
to promote the editorial function of this project. The definition of that
project, while provisional, and while open to continual redefinition by list
participants, is nonetheless aversive to a generalized discussion of poetry.
Rather, our aim is  to support, inform, and extend those directions in=
 poetry
that are committed to innovations, renovations, and investigations of form
and/or/as content, to the questioning of received forms and styles, and to=
 the
creation of the otherwise unimagined, untried, unexpected, improbable, and
impossible. **We also encourage subscribers to post information on
publications
and reading series that they have coordinated, edited, published, or in=
 which
they appear (see section 9 below).** (THIS MEANS *YOU*).=20

Please keep in mind that all posts go out immediately to all subscribers,=
 and
become part of an on-line archive. *Posting to Poetics is a form of
publication,
not personal communication.* Participants are asked to exercise caution=
 before
posting messages! While spontaneity of response may seem the very heart of=
 the
list at its best, it also has the darker side of circulating ideas that have
not been well considered (or considered by another reader -- editor or
friend).
Given the nature of the medium, subscribers do well to maintain some
skepticism
when reading the list and, where possible, to try to avoid taking what may=
 be
something close to a spontaneous comment made in the heat of exchange as if=
 it
were a revised or edited essay ("Let the Reader Beware!").=20

The "list owner" of Poetics is Charles Bernstein. Joel Kuszai is list
manager.=20
For subscription information contact us at POETICS@acsu.buffalo.edu.=20

___________________________________________________________=20

2. Subscriptions=20

Subscriptions to Poetics are free of charge. But we ask that you subscribe
with
your real name and we reserve the right to request additional information,
including address and phone number. All subscription information you supply
will remain confidential.=20

You can subscribe (sub) or unsubscribe (unsub) by sending a one-line=
 message,
with no subject line, to:=20

listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu=20

the one-line message should say:=20

unsub poetics=20

{or}=20

sub poetics Jill Jillway=20

(replacing Jill Jillway with your own name; but note: do not use your=20
name to unsub)=20

We will be sent a notice of all subscription activity. Please allow several
days for your new or re-subscription to take effect.=20

*=20

If you are having difficulty unsubscribing, please note:=20

Sometimes your e-mail address may be changed slightly by your system
administrator.  If this happens you will not be able to send messages to
Poetics or to unsubscribe, although you will continue to get your Poetics
mail.  To avoid this, unsub from the old address and resub from the new
address.  If you can no longer do this there is a solution if you use Eudora
(an e-mail program that is available free at shareware sites): from the=
 Tools
menu select "Options" and then select set-up for "Sending Mail": you may be
able to substitute your old address here and send the unsub message.=20

The most frequent problem with subscriptions is bounced messages. If your
system is often down or if you have a low disk quota, Poetics messages may=
 get
bounced.  Please try avoid having messages from the list returned to us. If
the
problem is low disk quota, you may wish to request an increase from your
system
administrator. (You may wish to argue that this subscription is part of your
scholarly communication!) You may also wish to consider obtaining a=
 commercial
account.=20

In general, if a Poetics message is bounced from your account, your
subscription to Poetics will be temporarily suspended. If this happens,=
 simply
resubscribe to the list in the normal manner, once your account problem has
been resolved.=20

All questions about subscriptions, whether about an individual subscription=
 or
subscription policy, should be addressed to the list's administrative=
 address:
poetics@acsu.buffalo.edu. Please note that it may take up to ten days, or
more,
for us to reply to messages.=20
____________________________________________________________________=20

3.  Cautions=20

Please do not post to the list personal or backchannel correspondence, or
other
unpublished material, without the express permission of the author.=
 Copyright
for all material posted on Poetics remains with the author; material from=
 this
list and its archive may not be reproduced without the author's permission,
beyond the standard rights accorded by "fair use".=20

The Poetics List has a 50 message daily limit. If more than 50 messages are
received, the listserver will automatically hold those additional messages
until the list is manually unlocked, usually the following day. While it is
difficult to prescribe a set limit on the number of daily, weekly, or=
 monthly
posts for any  subscriber, please keep this limit in mind. If you plan to
respond to multiple threads, it is generally preferable to consolidate your
reply into one message. While relevant excerpts from a post to which you are
responding may usefully be appended to your reply, please do not include in
your new post the whole text of a long previously posted message. As an
outside
maximum, the listserv is set to accept no more than 5 messages a day from=
 any
one subscriber.=20

Please do not send attachments or include extremely long documents in a=
 post,
since this may make it difficult for those who get the list via "digest" or
who
cannot decode attached or specially formatted files.=20

In addition to being archived at the EPC, some posts to Poetics (especially
reviews, obituary notices, announcements, etc.) may also become part of
specific EPC subject areas. Brief reviews of poetry events and publications
are
always welcome. (See section 7.)=20

Please do not send inquiries to the list to get an individual subscribers
address. To get this information, see section 6.=20

If you want someone to send out information to the list as a whole, or=
 supply
information missing from an post, or thank someone for posting something you
requested, please send the request or comment to the individual backchannel,
not to the whole list.=20

____________________________________________________________________=20

4. Digest Option=20

The Listserve program gives you he option to receive all the posted Poetics
message each day as a single message. If you would prefer to receive ONE
message each day, which would include all messages posted to the list for=
 that
day, you can use the digest option.  Send this one-line message (no subject
line) to=20

                                listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu=20

set poetics digest=20

NOTE:!! Send this message to "listserv" not to Poetics or as a reply=20
to this message!!=20

You can switch back to individual messages by sending this message:=20

set poetics mail=20
____________________________________________________________________=20

5. Temporarily turning off Poetics mail=20

Do not leave your Poetics subscription "active" if you are going to be away
for
any extended period of time! Your account may become flooded and you may=
 lose
not only Poetics messages but other important mail. You can temporarily turn
off your Poetics subscription by sending a message to
"listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu"=20

set poetics nomail=20

& turn it on again with: set poetics mail=20

When you return you can check or download missed postings from the Poetics=
=20
archive. (See 8 below.)=20

____________________________________________________________________=20

6. Who's Subscribed=20

To see who is subscribed to Poetics, send an e-mail message to
listserv@listserv.acsu.buffalo.edu; leave the "Subject" line of the e-mail
message blank.  In the body of your e-mail message type:=20

  review poetics=20

You will be sent within a reasonable amount of time (by return e-mail) a
rather
long list containing the names and e-mail addresses of Poetics subscribers.=
=20
This list is alphabetized by server not name.=20

or try:=20

review POETICS by name=20
review POETICS by country=20

which will give you the list alphabetically by name or a flawed list by
country
(since all ".com" and ".net"s are counted as US)=20

*Please do not send a message to the list asking for the address of a=
 specific
subscriber.*=20
____________________________________________________________________=20

7. What is the Electronic Poetry Center?=20

our URL is=20

http://writing.upenn.edu/epc=20

PUBLISHERS & EDITORS: Our listings of poetry and poetics information is open
and available to you. We are trying to make access to printed publications=
 as
easy as possible to our users and ENCOURAGE you to participate! Send a list=
 of
your press/publications to glazier@acsu.buffalo.edu with the words EPC Press
Listing in the subject line. You may also send materials on disk. (Write=
 file
name, word processing program, and Mac or PC on disk.) Send an e-mail=
 message
to the address above to obtain a mailing address to which to send your disk.
Though files marked up with html are our goal, ascii files are perfectly
acceptable. If your word processor will save files in Rich Text Format=
 (.rtf)
this is also highly desirable=20

Send us extended information on new publications (including any back cover
copy
and sample poems) as well as complete catalogs/backlists (including excerpts

and any distributors.=20

Initially, you might want to send short announcements of new publications
directly to the Poetics list as subscribers do not always (or ever) check=
 the
EPC; in your message please include full information for ordering.  If you
have
a fuller listing at EPC, you might also mention that in any Poetics posts.=

In many instances ad hoc approximations accomodate anomalies. In some
instances they are the quantitatively small, but exceedingly important,
differences between the observable and the real. (We tend to immediately
think of Heisenberg, and the relation between approximations and
uncertainties.) To incoporate those anomalies more completely, eventually
without many of those ad hoc approximations requires a paradigm shift. In my
opinion it will be a paradigm shift from a four dimensional space-time to a
five dimensional space-time, from Einsteinian 4d to post-Einsteinian 5d
modeling of reality. This will come about as new devices, instruments, are
designed, build and perfected, at the same time, that further deviate away
from a tradition that was grounded in a reality based upon the human sensory
system. The "invisible world", where many anomalies were a part of the
occult, divided away from "hard" science, will become "visible" to science
and science will become increasingly inclusive rather than exclusive. That
is where the scientist, the artist-poet,and the magician (as the
practitioner of magick), eventually meet and merge their knowledge to
achieve new effective power over the natural world. The results are
morphealist where all "reality" eventually becomes "virtual". Those results
are the achievement of the dreams of the alchemists, extended beyond the
limits of the alchemical worldview. The perception of a larger reality gives
rise to the transmutations of realities, and the paradigm shift _is_ in fact
the mythic "philosopher's stone".

We are currently living in that epoch of human history, within the history
of science, where that is in fact happening. It is happening right now.

one word about this capitalization of "Black," and a response to the false
cry of "reverse discrimination" --the practice arose in the 1970s and is
not an assertion of racial supremacy but of cultural pride, part of the
nationalist practices of that time.  to capitalize "white," in my view,
*would* be to assert white supremacy, and i cringe when i see it done by
students etc who think they are simply being "fair" by treating both
adjectives the same.  likewise, the subtext of brent's text was this
"reverse discrimination" red herring thing, whereby attempts to redress
injustice are seen as unjust because they undermine privilege which is so
naturalized it is not experienced or perceived as privilege by its
recipients.  and all of these matters have little or no bearing on whether
or not you like Maya Angelou's poetry.  As far as i'm concerned, it should
be understood in context.

so: two things (at least) coming to odds--everything is on the road to the
relic--and nothing seems (yet) capable of making it cross the border,
either to 'finally' disappear or be 'totally' reconstituted.  These two
slots correspond roughly to a circumscribed scientific world view and a
more 'ontological' rendition:  relics are mere evidence in the first
instance of matter's relationship with itself.  In the second, they
function as evidence of matter's relationship with consiousness
(notwithstanding the chiasmatic turnings which 'evidence' goes through at
the hands of both--so called 'postmodernism' and its significant
other(s)--which threatens to illuminate evidence till it chars and
disappears/evinesces/ashes-- or to ignore the possibility of the
'judgement of matter' (evidence) even as one views it through the bars.)

At any rate, the relic waits, co-terminous with time... even as it
attempts to subtly cruise 'through' it...yet strangely anxious.

Illegibility - for Perforations #17 -


An assumption of this century, Foucault's analysis of _divinatio_ not-
withstanding, is that the world is becoming increasingly legible -
that there are one or more _readings_ of the world - either through
the foreclosing of textuality (what is, can be said), or through an
increased understanding aligned with progress and progressivity. If
the world is an encoding, then decipherment continues to reduce the
unknown, and this might even be measured in terms of bandwidth, toler-
ances, and so forth.

On the other hand, one might argue towards an essential and irreduci-
ble _illegibility,_ that not everything is decipherable - that there
may, perhaps, be unknown or unknowable signs - as well as phenomena
masquerading as signs - as well as phenomena having no relation to the
symbolic at all.

I am not arguing for a "horizon" of the illegible, but a seepage that
occurs perhaps _within_ as well as without the legible. (For example,
it may not be the case that every culture can be traced or translated
- even in part - into every other.) Perhaps every domain is inherently
illegible; perhaps foundations are not always interpretable across the
board (and there for are not foundations sub specie aeternis). Consi-
der the illegibility and illiteracy of the world, and consider the
following, somewhat practical, concerns.

0 Issues of identity, recognition, self-reflexivity / asservation: To
what extent does identity depend on legibility? Can one "read" another
culture (without or without literacy in that culture) in such a manner
that anomie or the sensation of exile do not occur? Can one "read"
one's own culture in this manner? What is the phenmenology of anomie?
Of exile?

1 Illiteracy - the inability to read and write. Every text is illegi-
ble. (But if one is literate in the language of a text, and the text
is visually "clear," does that _necessarily_ mean it is legible?)
What is the post-Ivan Illich "take" on language, reading and writing?

2 Computer illiteracy - the inability to use computer technology. (Are
computers legible _all the way down_? What constitutes legibility in
this case?) What is the political economy of computer technology? Of
computer-mediated-communication (CMC) in relation to this? (Think of
the division between haves and have-nots for example. What - today -
constitutes _having_? Is bandwidth a consideration?)

3 Dead Media (Bruce Sterling) - illegible remnants, archeologies.
(What constitutes "media" in the first place?)

4 Infinite _kanji_ - wandering across a Borgesian world in which uni-
versals do not exist, in which each signified (in the sense of refer-
ence in the world) possesses its own sign. Nothing and everything are
simultaneously interpretable in writing. All signs are illegible and
legible; all are strictly indexical, ikonic, blurring the distinction.

5 Illegibility of or on or off the Net: What constitutes Internet
illegibility; what constitutes Net illiteracy? Do TCP/IP and other
protocols play a role here? Since virtual subjectivity is largely
textual (or entirely textual, if bit-mapping is considered as such),
what would be an _illegible subject_? What sorts of reception theory
apply here?

6 Are cultures translatable? Is habitus a discourse or discursive for-
mation? What is the political economy of legibility, of illegibility?

7 What constitutes misrecognition? How does misrecognition play into
the above? (Misrecognition: an alternative or alternative reading, a
non-intended reading, a reading-degree-zero, an absent or absent-mind-
ed reading.)

8 Reading and writing "foreign" cultures or the cultures of one's own.
Reading and writing on the Net.

9 And finally, to what extent is illegibility _inherent_ in the world
at large? And what constitutes this inherency?

Thanks for an insightful post, Charles.  Money aside, what comes to mind
immediately for me is that a publishing center (press, house) represents an
expression of what the publisher/editor considers valuable work that s/he
wants to make available for others to read.  It's the TASTE of the individual,
often quite varied and wide-ranging, that matters.  And, as Charles points
out, sometimes this is done at considerable sacrifice, because the labor given
to the effort is often unlikely to be rewarded except in intangible ways.

Depending upon the respect that a publisher has gained over a period of time,
that individual's vote of confidence (to use a crusty phrase) has meaning.
While none of us has a default nod in place for any given individual, it does
mean a great deal to me to know that a particular publisher, be it Charles,
Bill Slaughter, the Waldrops, Peter Ganick, Douglas Messerli, or any of
several publishers has recognized a work as worth publishing and distributing.

Looking at little magazines, some of them very inexpensively made, and looking
at web zines, less expensive still, we'd need to ask the question, "Why submit
work there?"  Often, it's the quality and the thinking behind the selection
that attracts us.

The act of duplicating something is a very small act.  The long-range effort
of developing credibility over time is large and, in my mind, worthy.  There
is all the difference in the world between printing and developing a PRESENCE.
Hats off to those who continue to do the latter.  It makes a huge difference,
even if not a monetarily worthwhile one.

Phillips will be closing on July 24.  It's at the The New York Public
Libary, 42nd Street and Fifth Avenue, in the Berg Exhibition Room, on the
third floor of the library. Library hours: Monday, Thursday=96Saturday, 10
a.m.=966 p.m. (closed Saturday, July 4), Tuesday and Wednesday, 11 a.m.=966

All of us involved with the poetry publishing documented here owe the
curators a huge debt of thanks in making this work so visible and for the
enormous care and intelligence they brought to the mounting of  this show.
It is very good news that an extensive and detailed catalog, with many
statements from the press editors and many reproductions, and of course
detailed bibliographic information, as well as an introduction by Jerome
Rothenberg, is forthcoming from the library and Steve Clay's Granary Books.
I am sure more will be posted on this soon.

*** Fla. man says injured by dancers' breasts

A Florida man has filed suit against a nightclub, claiming he
suffered whiplash when a topless dancer knocked him out with her
oversized breasts, the Tampa Tribune reported Wednesday. "Apparently
she jumped up and slammed her breasts on my head and just about
knocked me out," the newspaper quoted plaintiff Paul Shimkonis as
saying. Shimkonis, 38, filed suit seeking more than $15,000 in
damages from the Diamond Dolls club. The dancer, known as Tawny
Peaks, was not named in the lawsuit. According to the lawsuit,
Shimkonis and friends visited the bar on Sept. 27, 1996. Because he
was the guest of honor, the dancers asked him to sit on a low chair,
rest his head on the back of the chair and close his eyes. The
lawsuit said Peaks danced in front of him, and without warning or
consent "jumped on the plaintiff forcing her very large breasts into
his face causing his head to jerk backward." (Reuters)

*** Bingo - the scourge of Albanian marriages

Divorce in Albania is increasingly being blamed on husbands' passion
for chance games - particularly bingo - a newspaper said Wednesday.
Bingo and booze were cited as the deciding factor in half of all
divorce cases lodged at the courts of Europe's most impoverished
country in the last three months, the daily Gazeta Shqiptare said.
The burgeoning obsession with bingo has pushed the traditional causes
for divorce - adultery and violence - to under a third of all
complaints. (Reuters)

Because a few people have expressed interest:
                 Introducing GARE DU NORD

Have you checked out Notely & Oliver's new publication _Gare du Nord:
A Magazine of poetry and opinion from Paris_ ?  It promises to be for
the 90s what their newsletter/zine _Scarlet_ was for the 90s [sic]: a
fun/serious mix of poetry, commentary, criticism, dreams,
premonitions . . ..  Subs $18 for 3 issues. 8.5 x 12 xerox/staplebound.
Black & White w/art & graphics. Issue 2, which they hope to make "interactive"
(see "Reader Inquiry Feature,"below), I hear, is in the works . .

Issue 1, '97 includes

Notley's column "Cosmic Chat" part dream sequence, part poetics, part
political commentary satire (well, what did you expect . . .?
Remember "Dream Gossip" in _Scarlet_?)

"We've gotto get syntax rid of, eh?"
An intriguing dialogue (between "X" and "Y" -- though at one point a typo
reveals that" X" is really "A"), and, in the Notley "outrider"
experiemental poetic tradition, a bipartisan critique and discussion
of utopianism and some radical assumptions about syntactic experiment.
Ultimately a discourse on "change" in poetry. In short, in agreement
with the notion that "conventional syntax freezes the genre"
but problematizing the assumption "that changing language
changes the hegemony of political languages, etc."  The dialogue, a
procces/working-through rather than a judgement, catalogues syntactical
innovations (with a few examples/explications), and ruminates on the
relationship between cognition and writing, and discusses interestingly
the aleatory and the "mannered" as both intersect with syntactic
experiment.  Worth the price of the issue.

"The Reader Inquiry Feature" where, for constructing an
"interactive issue" they request "anecdotes of strange occurences"
such as "premonitions of death or appearances of dead people and
mental events involving time bending experiences or extraordinary
awareness"

Subject:      Re: Another Dispatch from Naropa
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain

Three weeks of non-stop poetry and some 8000 words of improvised,
impressionistic (and frequently stilted) reporting from Naropa have left me
exhausted.  I+d decided I was more or less finished with these posts, but
the dulcet Jane Dalrymple Hollo convinced me last night to keep going,
albeit with briefer posts. Okay, I said. Once more into the murky etcetera.

Last night+s reading (July 1) featured Ali Zarrin, Kai Nimenen, Lorna Dee
Cervantes and Victor Hernandez Cruz.

Ali read first from his own work, a long, headstrong rush of a poem,
beautifully cadenced, about coming to America, followed by a formal and very
lovely metaphysical love poem, this latter prefaced by a funny letter from
Ginsberg telling Ali to forgo this sort of rot and adhere to the doctrine
"no ideas but in things." These were followed by marvelous translations of
Hafiz and Attar from classical Persian, including ghazals.

Kai Nimenen+s delivered his poems in Finnish, with Anselm Hollo providing
the English.  Kai, who is extraordinarily modest in person, possesses a very
deft sense of wit and these poems, with their affectionate examination of
the ironies and absurdities of our age, had the audience in stitches. I
don+t know if a translation of his work exists yet in English but I highly
recommend him all the same.

Lorna Dee Cervantes began her reading with a very candid erotic poem, then
read from a long section of her forthcoming _Drive_ entitled "Coffee."
"Coffee" is an impassioned litany of the atrocities committed by Mexican
troops against the people of Chiapas.  As a political tract, it+s fairly
compelling; as poetry, somewhat less so.  Propelled by the best of
intentions,  it belongs to the genre of the poetry of mere denunciation --
whose chief aim is to whip the poet and maybe the listener as well into a
froth of righteous indignation.  A woman two seats over from me was moved to
tears by this brow-beating work. I found it to be over-the-top: hyperbolic,
full of dramatic posturing, self-importance and stale, outworn language.
Maybe I+m just too damned obtuse.

Victor Hernandez Cruz closed the evening. Watching his expansive gestures,
arms flying over the lectern, feet shifting as in some slow-motion tango, it
was easy to see why he+d claimed the Taos Heavyweight Whatchamacallit two
years in a row.  At times he seemed poised over his poetry like some great
ferruginous raptor, ready to impale the very lines he read by a sheer act of
will. Some poems were in English, some in Spanish. The wit was sharp, the
passion exuberant, the language vivid. He may have read a little too long,
judging by the weary looks of fellow listeners. But how can you begrudge a
poet who invites everyone to join him for salsa dancing the next night at a
local bar?

Thanks to Linda Russo for that info about Alice and Doug's new
publication -- it sounds great! Perhaps there's hope for the
_Impercipient Lecture Series_ to re-emerge after all . . .

Thanks to Charles Alexander for his dedication and his consistently
interesting and absorbing posts.

I recently subscribed to _American Poetry Review_ for the first time in
many moons -- I used to look at it every now and then in the early 80s,
and must have gradually considered it too "mainstream" (though I know
that's a loaded word) -- at any rate, it seems these days to be a fairly
attractive mix, still mostly loaded with recent MFA grads, but Ann
Lauterbach has a interesting column in the current issue, which also
reprints Stein's "What are Masterpieces". And there's also a poem by
Jeff Clark (whose poems, I think, recently made an appearance on the
list) -- he's identified as "an agent in the Federal Bureau of
Investigation's PHO Unit."

This takes me aback. Does anyone know, first, what the "PHO Unit" might
mean? And second . . . isn't it a little MUCH for a poet to be a member
of the FBI? Insurance vice-presidents are one thing, but this just seems
beyond the pale to me! An "extra-textual" consideration, to be sure, but
I'd welcome any comment about this . . . choice of profession.

CNN has now retracted the nerve gas story that was discussed here two
weeks ago. So I guess we can all go back to trusting the government now.
I dunno Pat -- I wasn't there, of course, but I could use a little
righteous indignation every so often . . . didn't Blake call it "the
voice of God" in "The Marriage of Heaven and Hell"?

That is more realistic. Though I do not know of any "non profit" presses of

Yes, definitely a publisher, and without such publishers chancing to be
lucky enough to be able to survive, freedom of expression, diversity in
literature,
and in fact a lot more that we value and take for granted, would not have
any chance to survive either.

It is more important than you think it is.

That is a lot more than authors get for having to PAY to have a chapbook

I had let my subscription run out on that photo-opportunity fest, so like
J.Carson, "I didn't know that." I've been had! Now I have to tear down my Jeff
Clark poster. Fuck! (Maybe I can hang the Jeff Clark poster next to my agent

Never heard of anyone learning Esperanto here but what do I know? It sounds possible. Although weird I
admit.

Are you sure they don't mean Hawaiian? Hawaiian is the other official state language (it is in the
constitution--Hawai'i might be the U.S.'s only in name bi-lingual state; anyone know?; but the state
really acts like it is monolingual--you can't, although you should be able to, get a drivers permit in
Hawaiian).

There are Hawaiian immersion schools here (you learn the U.S. curriculum in Hawaiian; schools still must
meet what the mainland determines as important to learn--a continual complaint). And Hawaiian is being
relearned and rewritten as a result. It was close to dead at one time. Lots of discussion about the "new"
Hawaiian not being "real" Hawaiian. Etc. Similar to Ireland.

Re: Summi's questions...

Filipino community has been split, of course. Jessica Hagedorn has come out in support of the book as
fiction. Michelle Cruz Skinner also. Several other writers against. Don't know abou Alarcon.

Candace Fujikane actually addresses the _Bluest Eye_ issue in her work. She argues that Bluest Eye
contextualizes the rapist (that moment when readers see into him) and thus places his rape in context.
_Blue's Hanging_, she argues, does not do this.

I think the Japanese v. Filipino issue comes to play here in Hawai'i more than elsewhere where
Japanese-Americans are part of the system (the government, the hotel industry, the fancy houses, etc.)
while Filipinos still tend to not be part of that system. Us v. them, in its many forms, might be the
trope of Hawai'i anyway.

Although, Summi, I agree with you that this issue is hard to sort out. In Yamanaka's work there is this
examination of sexuality (which is so necessary here--sexuality issues seem to be on the back burner to a
disturbing degree; I just went to a reading where the U.S.'s colonialism was compared to butt fucking and
the poem said that no one could possible like either). There is this reply to Hawai'i as "paradise" that
feeds the tourist industry. There is this valuation of pidgin (which is such a relief to many students who
have been told things like not to speak pidgin even on the playground in grade school and are angry about
it). All good things.

This is so true: the best reason to publish anywhere is that you are pleased to
have your work included alongside the work of other writers the

a dialogue that engages both a reader and a writer:

I'll never forget the look on the faces of all these people as they entered
the room for the first time. It was as if they had seen a ghost. There they
were, hands on their hips , some staring off in the pigmented distance. Some
looking straight-on in their nakedness said; "this is us." "We are these who

Beyond this they didn't know what to think.

1). Global warming can be alleviated by existing technologies
    being more rapidly perfected and implemented. This includes world wide
    effecting of gaseous emissions control technologies in factories and in
    transportation. This also includes implementions of new motive technologies
    utilizing such means as electromagentism, and hydrogen engines.

2). The ozone depletion can be reversed using technology, if necessary.
    Ozone is not that difficult to manufacture, if necessary.

3). Overpopulation is solvable, by means of education and technology.

4). Species impoverishment requires an effort to map and store the genetic
    code of all species that are known to be in danger, or are rare and
    known to exist. This is currently possible. Replication of those species
    in the future, on this or other planets, will then be equally possible,
    for whatever purposes. When world population is under control and
    brought to a more viable level as to long term quality of life for all
    the wildlife areas, the preserves, can be re-established and restocked
    for human enjoyment.

There is one problem that defies solution. That is MANAGEMENT.

There is lack of management skill, and management effort, in identifying the
real problems, analyzing the properly, identifying potential solutions,
proving those, and implementing them on a large enough scale to be
effective. There is quite a lot of management in effect as to profit
margins. The two factors, of management of those kinds of problems and
management of profit margins need not be in conflict with each other. The
two can be synonymous rather than oppositional. It is only a problem of how
you happen to look upon it. Marxism  always teaches seeing it as
irremediably oppositional, as dialectic, as conflict that can only be
resolved by violence of one side against the other. We are brain washed too
easily into Marxist dialectics and fail to see it any other way, even in
North America. When we are, it makes us into absolute fools, and marxism
potnetially becomes a self fulfilling prophecy. In fact it is not a
dialectic between profits and global problem solving where the problem cause
is constantly being attributed to the quest for profits. That making of a
devil out of profit fails to see that it is not profit that is the evil, but
how, specifically, the profit happens to be made.

Martin Heidegger in his consternation about modern technology and what he
saw as its horrors said "only a god can save us". The was lamenting the
failure of technology to be the great liberator that it once promised to be.
He was wrong.
A god could never save us. Without proper managment even a god would fail
miserably at the task.

So far I see almost no MANAGEMENT in any significant global problem area.

There potentially is a practical, or at least effective, solution for every
world problem, of the kinds mentionned. Many of the existing solutions are
the same as applying a tourniquette to an open wound. The bleeding is
reduced, but if nothing else is done the limb is completely lost. If the
tourniquette is loosened once in a while, the process of bleeding to death
is usually prolonged, or the limb is lost anyway. Essentially that is what
the ecological movements, the environmentalists, and others, have been
doing. They have been attempting to convince people to apply tourniquettes
to the wounds, rather than actually solving the underlying difficulties.
Instead of coming up with new effective solutions to the problems they have
a "do without" mentality. That is only a tourniquette. It is not a solution
to the problem. We have to get out of that mode of thinking.

What charles describes is not unique among _fine_ press publishers. My
friend Brian Richards at Bloody twin press expects the authors to chip
in because the papers he uses or has people make for him are very
expensive, Gary Metras at Adastra expects authors to chip in with time
to produce (hand set galleys) and a minimum number of books sold. They
are well worth it. Look at Ted Enslins _Music in the Key of C_  by
Bloody twin or _Niagara Falls_ by Jim Daniels by Adastra. A book worth
owning every page of like chax and granary.

While I admire the fine press trade, unfortunately, I am a publisher,
primarily because I move around too much to have one of those things in
my basement. I can work out a better deal in copies and cash but the
production value is not even close to comparable. Then we are back to
Sheila's statement which buoys it up.

By the way charles, Adastra printed the larger run books on not as fine
a run, like yr PB book, and seems facing a similar quandry.

Mr. Shmeederer shows he knows nothing of either restaurant prices or the
Four Quartets. Eliot himself felt $17.50 for good chicken tetrazzini was
(I quote from an interview in Partisan Review) "not out of line."
Indeed, in The Dry Salvages, Eliot imputes this very notion to Krishna,
though not precisely in those words.

        George Bowering, David Baratier, _is_ the richest poet in Canada.

As a footnote, I will add that i have never received payment other than in
books, from any of my Canadian publishers. (This info may be incorrect; I
could have been given money which I spent and then forgot about.) I have
never paid to be published there--nor here, in the U S of A. But many do,
one way or another; if you have the funds, many small presses will
appreciate your donation. There is no way any so-thought "poetry world" can
make itself different from the wave of history. Is there?  So money is
allowed to talk. Good for money.

In Canada, leastways, were one to pay to publish a book, one might, over
the years,and given it is at least 48 pp long, recoup the outlay through
the Library Roaylties Fund. In the USA, no such system of recourse exists.
I register your complaint, & await suggestions for its removal.

In yesterday's NY Times, poet laureate Robert Pinsky declines to comment on
the US Supreme Court's ruling in the NEA vs. Karen Finley case on the
grounds that he has yet to read the decision.

I guess that this is an area into he doesn't want to tread simply based on
some principle like the freedom of speech without a lot of additional
research. Unlike his recent foray into educational policy.

Kind of makes you feel special about the post of poet laureate, doesn't it?

Just so that you don't find yourself in the same foolish predicament, the
entire ruling can be found at:

http://supct.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/97-371.ZS.html

I'd reproduce it here, but it's 33 pages long. Definitely worth a read, though.

The absolutely false statement that if we cannot measure it it does not exist
becomes the most unreasonable, when it was once the most reasonable attitude.
Old Bill had it right when he wrote about there being more things in the
heavens and upon earth than are dreamt of in your philosophies [meaning
natural philosophy, therefore sciences].

Science is highly _intuitive_.  This is likely why Newton was drawn to
esoteric discussions of "revelation".  This is why Einstein said "I cannot
believe that god plays dice with the universe". Of course there is a problem
of scientific intuition and intelligence coming up against millenia of non
scientific programming. Every scientist therefore internally conflicted and
many a scientist highly courageous in going painfully against the
conservative nature of the a-priori programming inherent from a highly
irrational, ideological, human history by nature, and a similarly irrational
and ideologially tainted contextual situatedness of nurture. Some of the
latter being education.

Intelligence seeks patterns of _order_ in what appears to be _chaos_.
True intelligence finds them there, where they were previously overlooked
and disregarded. The intuition of orderly presentation and conveyance, of
therefore useful, information where there previously appeared to be only
chaotic and indecipherable.

Sometimes what appears to be wholly chaotic appears that way solely because
our methods of observation, and our paradigms for understanding what we
observe, _determine_ it to appear that way. It is not that way at all, but
until our methods and our paradigms change that is the appearance, the maya,
of it. Our methods of observation and our paradigms, are what cause us to
observe only the shadows in the cave. Plato failed to recognize that he was
only describing the error and not the overcoming of that very same error. He
placed his existing paradigms, historically situated as they were, above the
realities in themselves, as something not only determinative as
paradigmatic, but also as more desirable. He believed science was doomed to
an eternal quagmire of maya, watching the shadows dance on the walls of the
cave. The Hindu term "maya" is most applicable. We have no true correlate to
that term in English. Meaning as the finding or order where there appeared
to be chaos, comes suddenly, as intuitive insight.

True intelligence means breaking thought free from worship of existing
paradigms. It means giving the ideas a shadow existence, metaphorically on
the walls of the skull cave, as opposed to the realities of things in
themselves.
True intelligence then allows the thing to be, to reveal, to show its
various patterns of order from the apparent chaos, uninterceded by the often
ideological paradigmatic determinations that previously offered up only
certain patterns and not others. Some of those patterns were in fact false
readings into the text and some of science was as though a schizophrenic
babbling meanings where there were none. The ideas in the mind  had taken
precedence and superimposed over the external observables. The pattern
found, as precedent idea, where there was in fact no such pattern.

As science becomes more willing to abandon previous theories, and even
previous paradigms, as determinative of what is considered meaningful, it
becomes less schizophrenic and more in touch with natural reality. There is
a seeing through some of the maya, and a rise in true intuitive insight. We
might say that Plato's viewpoint leads to a schizophrenic and religious
mentality where at least some ideas are elevated above all else and held to
be sacred. Reality is then defined, meaning read into the world, based on
those mental products. Plato was the problem and science is tending towards
overcoming that viewpoint. In some regards Philosophy has continued to lead
the way, as there have been many philosophical attempts during this century
to grapple with Platonism's excessive influence. An influence which had been
used and bolstered up for centuries by religion, which is too often
essentially schizoid or schizophrenic at its core being ideas created by
human minds and then superimposed upon the world to determine what can be
considered as being, and what cannot be included as having being, whether in
fact imaginary or real.

Very odd, as every small press in Canada that I have had any information of
or about, from anyone, demands money up front to publish anything from
anyone they deal with.

We have several small presses in Hamilton, and I know of some in Toronto,
and unless it is a contest where entry fees pay for the winner's chapbook to
be published, everyone pays significant cost plus margin for everything that
is published. I mean, _everyone_.

>would be hard to find a publisher of poetry in Canada that does not pay
>the poets---unless one is talking about a little local mimeo outfit

I am talking about the average small press that puts out a dozen or more
titles a year, and catalogues them under its own name. Every one I know of
gets paid by the author for every copy printed, cost plus margin, based on
the kind of work they have been asked to do and the format of publication.

I have yet to receive one piece of information, in ten years of writing, and
following anything that comes along, and being a member of the Canadian
Poetry Association, receiving their regular mailings, that indicates any
press that is willing to publish anyone for any less than cost plus margin.
The exceptions are _only_ contest winners where one author is selected from
hundreds of enterants who all paid a fee of from 10 to 30 dollars each, to
submit a sample of their work. One is selected and published, usually
getting only
some copies of the publication, while the press retains the larger quantity.
Some contests provide all the copies to the author, but that is less frequent.

That is simply the way that it is.

I cannot really afford the League of Canadian Poets. They do not publish the
work of members either, but they do promote and distribute the works of
members somewhat, along with the publishers who publish them. That is the
other Canadian association for poets that provides some information to
members as to contests, publications, and presses that are looking for
customers. Besides, with only one book self published, the league might not
even accept me. They have certain requirements about number and kind of
publications, in addition to relatively steep fees and the costs of not
being local to where I live as to gatherings.

I know that at least some of the books published by members of the Canadian
League of Poets are also author paid for, as I know of the practices of a
few of the publishers who do the publishing. I cannot speak for all
instances, but only for the limits of what I know, and have been informed of
by others, or read in the relevant publications of organizations as
presented to me.

Some of the information comes from someone who is a well regarded Canadian
poet, established, and a member of the relevant small press association, who
knows the practices of other presses and does what they do. It is typical
for members to do essentially the same as one another, so as to compete with
one another on a somewhat more level playing field. There are rules, albeit
unwritten, that they abide by with each other. There are few, if any,
maverick entrepreneurs in the biz, and few such ever survive for any lengths
of time. Everyone eventually conforms or perishes so that there is bread on
the table of those that survive.
Of course a small press, a publisher of any kind, can only become a member
of the small press association if they publish a certain number of tomes per
year.
Otherwise they might as well be mushrooms growing in the manure in the pitch
dark. Much of the relevant information is limited to dues paying members in
any instance that I know of in anything that I know of. (Another kind of pay
per.)

As for readings...It is unusual to have to pay a fee to read. That is almost
unheard of. I said that it is typical for people to be allowed to read at
good venues for readings, where there are sizable audiences, if:

1). they have paid to publish a book and the publisher is involved in
    the organizing, as they often are

2). they have paid for a poetry course, seminar, workshop, to an established
    poet and that poet is doing the organizing, or is a close contact of
    the organizers (if the organizers are media)

3). there is something to gain for the organizers from inviting that person
    to read, in terms of other connections, promotions, inclusion. They invite
    those they can profit from, rather than those they cannot profit from.
    That becomes a kind of fee, exacted by those who do the organizing. Those
    they cannot profit from simply are not invited.

That is the gist of it.

Then there is the fact that it costs money to go anywhere to read. The
further the distance the more money it costs. That is a different matter.
First pay to publish a few books, then pay a few established poets for
workshops that
run readings, and pay one's own costs to go and read. That is the sum total,
for most people who venture into presenting their own work.

Perhaps those with agents do better. I cannot speak to that either, except
as to hearsay that indicates they do reasonably well. Some publishers act as
agents.

au contraire,  mon cher, this is exactly one of those moments when "not
doing one's homework" and offering as an excuse that one hasn't read the
assignment carefully enough translate into the same thing.  And if i read
rs's post properly, pinsky is not the target; one would be right to be
outraged at *any* poet laureate who responded thus.  i checked out the URL;
it's pretty discouraging.

Maria,

If RP chooses to make no statement, you may have a point -- that silence
could be eloquent.  But right now it is entirely knee-jerk
anti-establishmentism to condemn Pinsky.  I believe that an informed
opinion a day late is generally better, and more powerful, than a facile
opinion delivered off the cuff.  Perhaps you and I feel differently
about this.

Ron,

You should also not who did bravely speak out
(and has in the past)--poet/playwright Mac Wellman
spoke strongly against the supreme court decision.
And he couldn't even research the issue, since he
was in Ireland on a visit. Mac also wrote a play
about the whole issue, 7 Blowjobs, thanking the endowment
for support (despite the fact they asked him to remove
their name) and dedicated it to "those supreme clowns
of our sad time, Jesse Helms and Donald Wildomn; also
to Representative Dana Rohrabacher and the Reverend Pat
Robertson, because they have shown such an abiding interest
in my work. These gents (God help them!) compreise the
Four Horsebrained Horsemen of our Contemporary Cornball
Apocalypse."

When the decency clause was enacted, Sun & Moon Press
refused to apply for the NEA and wrote letters of protest
to the then-chairman and congressman. The governor of
the great state of California (then mayor of San Diego
and serving on the National Council) was the only one
to write back.: he believed in censorship, he proclaimed!

Mac has certainly stood out as a hero in all of this over
the years.

How is the gov't deciding not to give somebody money based on a decency
clause censorship?  Who ever expected the gov't to be a good judge of art?
Who ever told Finley to stop performing?  That's censorship.
I love doing this.  Knee-jerk anti-establishmentism is what innovative
poetics is all about.  I love saying this!

i don't know why they always schedule these things when people are away.
but there is a wealth of classic non-narrative film playing this weekend
in manhattan:

in particular, at anthology film archives, you can see michael snow's
wavelength on friday 7/3 (tonight) at 8 and snow's <--> (which we
refer to "in the business" as "back and forth") on 7/4 saturday at 8. other
films along the way in both cases.THEN Jack Smith's "flaming creatures"
with a short, sunday (7/5) at 8 & 9. real cheap too and convenient.
oh - also should mention the genius ken jacobs showing laurel & hardy shorts
saturday at 6, should be even funnier than fireworks - & also very
cool-sounding films from taiwan all weekend that i should know more about
but don't.

but at the same time, moma is showing a program called "1968" &, as it
ends, is showing 5 avant-garde programs from around then.

here's a weekend schedule that i copied down off the moma phone line:

friday 7/3:
  3pm program 3
  6pm program 4
  8pm program 5
  8pm Andy Warhol's LONESOME COWBOYS!!! special bonus!

saturday 7/4
  2pm program 5
  5pm program 2

sunday 7/5
  2pm program 4
  5pm program 3

description:

program 2: whitneys; breer; bartlett; jordan; hindle(?)
program 3: joyce wieland; lyon; "great blondino"
program 4: peter kubelka; bruce baillie, "castro street"; snow, "wavelength"
program 5: landow, "film in which there appear..."; baillie; ernie gehr!;
hollis frampton, "surface tension"!; paul sharits, "n:o:t:h:i:n:g"!; & more

yes kids, program 5 is the real mccoy - rare flicker films, rare
frampton, the sublime ernie gehr... free with moma admission i think..
also program 4 and the warhol film on friday night shouldn't be missed.
why do they always throw these things together when everyone's away..

Thank you, Patrick Pritchett, for continued posts on Naropa summer readings. Kai
Nieminen's reading (mentioned below) was exceptional. I'm privileged to have at
hand now a copy of one of Kai Nieminen's poems as translated by Anselm Hollo.
It's too delightful not to quote, then I think I'll hop on the next plane to
Finland...

Poets are wrong about poetry,
readers are wrong about poetry.
Critics are right about poetry:
it's just idle prattle from past decades.

Critics are wrong about criticism,
artists are wrong about criticism.
Secretaries of State are right about criticism:
there's no need to give a shit.

Politician are wrong about politics,
the media are wrong about politics.
All of us are right about politics:
it's the wrong actions taken at the wrong time.

Economists are wrong about the economy,
consumers are wrong about the economy.
The rich are right about the economy,
that's one secret they'll never reveal to us.

Farmers are wrong about agriculture,
laborers are wrong about agriculture.
Cows are right about agriculture:
eat what's in front of you, let them milk you dry.

THE ROAD TO OCOSINGO

Andrew Schelling

* * * * * * * *

In August 1995 I traveled to Mexico with poet Anne Waldman, novelist
Rikki Ducornet, and psychoanalyst Jonathan Cohen. We met in Mexico City,
a high altitude cosmopolis ringed by mountains, currently the planet's
most populous city. The poets Elsa Cross and David Huerta had scheduled
a reading and reception for us at Casa del Poeta. Following a few days
among friends we went south into Chiapas State. Chiapas held three
interconnected interests--cities and pyramids of classic Maya antiquity;
contemporary Tzeltal and Tzotzil speaking villages in misty pine forest
highlands; and somewhere, out there in the Lacandon threading jungle
paths as they elude the Mexican military, the EZLN Zapatista army with
its eloquent shadowy elders whose communiques sound like a blend of
MesoAmerican shamanism, 20th century poetics, and post-Marxist
pragmatism.

     Those who go by night said, 'And we see that this way
     of governing that we name is no longer the way for the many,
     we see that it is the few who now command, and they command
     without obeying...'

The journey was a brief one. We hoped to dig into Juana de Asbaje's
poems, gaze upon skeletal eyes of Palenque ruler Pacal, and meet a few
knowledgable contemporaries. A modest and unremarkable attempt to learn
what we could of the temper of Mexico in the EZLN climate. To see what
we might find out firsthand, not simply from hearsay. To keep eyes and
ears open, take notes like spies, and carry a few books for the work.
This despite word the Zapatistas were disburdening literature from their
own rucksacks. "Because you're loaded with books doesn't mean someone
else offers to carry your ammunition," a subcomandante had recently
confided.

This is a journal of the trip, in mongrel mix of prose and verse. Its
sense of form is much indebted to Japanese haibun, good style for
jotting notes in a rucksack. I kept the writing deliberately loose.
Haibun is always stricter, more keenly regimented in how it balances
prose and terse lyric.

Matsuo Basho is the poet who brought haibun to its keenest development,
particularly in his travel journals. As we wandered Basho trailed
without mention behind. Oku no Hosomichi, his best known work (1690),
recounts a journey by foot into Japan's northern hinterlands. In his day
the province of Oku was an unpredictable and slightly scary back
country, geographically and culturally distant from Edo, the capital,
and a site of potential unrest. Just as in post-NAFTA North America it
is Chiapas first--then Guerrero, Oaxaca, and other Mexican states--that
emerge as shakiest members of an economic policy crafted in Washington.

In English Basho's title is "The Back Road to Oku."  On the back road to
Ocosingo I heard the place names echo.

Andrew Schelling, born 1953, grew up in New England. Early influences
were the region's granite mountains and resurgent conifer forests, as
well as Asian art collections seen in Cambridge and Boston. Moving west,
he spent seventeen years in northern California. Wilderness
explorations, companionship with urban-based poets of the San Francisco
Bay Area, production of samizdat poetry journals, and travels through
Europe, Asia and North America. Southeast Asian language study at The
University of California, Berkeley, resulted in ongoing translation
projects. In 1991 he moved to Boulder, Colorado, to join The Naropa
Institute's faculty. He teaches poetry, Sanskrit and wilderness studies.

Since the decision to uphold the legality of decency tests for arts grants
seems to be based on the majority of the justices interpreting the law that
was being challenged as merely advisory, while Souter's dissent (correctly,
I think) looks at the issue in a very different way, it may not be
unreasonable for someone who had only heard or seen a digest version of the
decision to want to know more about it.

But the NY Times article Ron is talking about ran a full week after the
Court's decision was announced June 25th.  Far more than, say, the
decisions on the line item veto, attorney-client privilege, healthcare for
retired miners or any of the other issues resolved by the Supreme Court
announced on the same day, the decision on decency standards for the arts
has direct bearing on Pinsky's own art and his role as poet laureate. By
the beginning of July, Pinsky should have had an informed opinion on the
issue, it's his job.

& in response to Henry's carping about why & how this can be considered
government censorship, Souter's dissent may make it more clear. The
following is the section excerpted form his dissent printed in the NY
Times:

>The question here is whether the italicized segment (here put into
>brackets) of this statute is unconstitutional on its face: artistic
>excellence and artistic merit are the criteria by which applications [for
>grants from the National Endowment for the Arts] are judged, <taking into
>consideration general standards of decency and respect for the diverse
>beliefs and values of the American public.>" It is.
>
>The decency and respect proviso mandates viewpoint-based decisions in the
>disbursement of Government subsidies, and the Government has wholly failed
>to explain why the statute should be afforded an exemption from the
>fundamental rule of the First Amendment that viewpoint discrimination in
>the exercise of public authority over expressive activity is
>unconstitutional. The Court's conclusions that the proviso is not
>viewpoint based, that it is not a regulation, and that the NEA may
>permissably engage in viewpoint-based discrimination, are all patently
>mistaken.

In other words, while Henry is correct that Karen Finley has not been
legally stopped by the government from making whatever kind of art works
she wants to, by using her viewpoint & the content of her work as a basis
to make final decisions after it has been selected because of "artistic
excellence and artistic merit", the NEA as a government agency is stepping
over First Amendment lines.

The issue isn't censorship as such, but what kinds of controls over
disbursements the government is allowed to make. Choosing among artists who
have been previously selected for government support and deciding based on
the content matter of their work isn't the way government is supposed to
work in the US.

"Book Fungus Can Get You High"

     By Ellen Warren / Chicago Tribune

 CHICAGO -- Getting high on great literature is taking on a whole new
 meaning.  It turns out that, if you spend enough time around old books
 and decaying manuscripts in dank archives, you can start to
 hallucinate. Really.

 We're not talking psychedelia, "Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds" stuff,
 here. But maybe only a step or two away from that.

 Experts on the various fungi that feed on the pages and on the covers
 of books are increasingly convinced that you can get high - or at least
a
 little wacky -- by sniffing old books. Fungus on books, they say, is a
 likely source of hallucinogenic spores.

 The story of The Strangeness in the Stacks first started making its way
 through the usually staid antiquarian books community late last year
 with the publication of a paper in the British medical journal, The
 Lancet.

 There, Dr. R.J. Hay wrote of the possibility that "fungal
hallucinogens"
 in old books could lead to "enhancement of enlightenment."

 "The source of inspiration for many great literary figures may have
been
 nothing more than a quick sniff of the bouquet of mouldy books," wrote
 Hay, one of England's leading mycologists (fungus experts) and dean of
 dermatology at Guy's Hospital in London.

 Well, said an American expert on such matters, it may not be that
 easy.

 "I agree with his premise - but not his dose. It would take more than a
 brief sniff," aid Monona Rossol, an authority on the health effects of
 materials used in the arts world.

 For all the parents out there, these revelations would seem ideal for
 persuading youngsters to spend some quality time in the archives.

 But attention kids: You can't get high walking through the rare books
 section of the library.

 Rossol said it would take a fairly concentrated exposure over a
 considerable period of time for someone to breathe in enough of the
 spores of hallucinogenic fungus to seriously affect behavior. There are
 no studies to tell how much or how long before strange behavior takes
 hold.

 Still, this much seems apparent - if you want to find mold, the only
 place that may rival a refrigerator is a library.

 Just last week the Las Cruces, N.M., Public Library was closed
 indefinitely, prompted by health concerns after a fungus outbreak in
the
 reference section. Library director Carol Brey said the fungus promptly
 spread to old history books and onward to the literature section.

 The town's Mold Eradication Team, she said, shuttered the library as a
 precaution. "We didn't want to take any chances," she said. A mold
 removal company will address the problem, which is believed to have
 originated in the air conditioning system.

 Psychedelic mushrooms, the classic hallucinogenic fungus, derive their
 mind-altering properties from the psilocybin and psilocin they produce
 naturally.

 One historic example of this phenomenon, scientists now believe, is the
 madness that prevailed in the late 1600s in Salem, Mass., where ergot,
a
 hallucinogenic fungus, infected the rye crops that went into rye bread.
 Ergot contains lysergic acid, a key compound of the hallucinogenic drug
 LSD. This tiny fungus and its wild effects on the rye-bread-eating
women
 may have led to the Salem witch trials.

 Rossol, a New York chemist and consultant to Chicago's Field Museum of
 Natural History who publishes the newsletter Acts Facts, the journal of
 Arts, Crafts and Theater Safety, said that there have not been
 scientific studies on the hallucinogenic effects of old books.

 But, relying on accounts from newsletter readers who report their own
 strange symptoms - ranging from dizziness to violent nausea - she says
 there is no doubt that moldy old volumes harbor hallucinogens.

That was interesting, Herb, let me carp a little more.  I like Souter &
I think the majority on the current Supreme Court are often threatening to
individual rights.  I question the ability of anyone to decide on the
artistic merit of a work without taking content & viewpoint into account.
So the NEA is being asked to do the impossible in the name of the 1st
Amendment, and Karen Finley & Jesse Helms, who deserve each other since
they're so alike (missionary extremists) will go on battling over the
dough. All I said was, it's not censorship.  It may be unconstitutional
though!  But is it art?

praps you could clear things up by being more specific
(naming names) of presses that demand payment frm poets
they publish?  none of the presses i'm familiar with
(coach house, curvd H&z, proper tales, mercury press,
ecw, fingerprinting inkoperated, serif of nottingham,
spiderplotz in ratholes, torque, above/ground) have such
requirements, which argues against such being as universal
as you say...  but i'd be interested in finding out more...

>i don't think you pay enough bob

You are right. When I was so broke that I was living off of some stale
rye crisps, and had nothing in the world except a line to the Internet, for
some months actually given free to me by a service provider that I had been
buying access from for a few years.....publishing what could have easily
been my last poetic words, while attempting to maintain some political
activism aimed at world peace and a reduction of international tensions
meant to save some lives and better some others.....I did not have a friend
in the world who would even buy me a cup of coffee. They expected me to buy
them one....And so it goes. It is all difficult to do on stale rye crisps,
while also spending the last dime looking for a paying job, but sometimes
that is what life means.

So I knew right then that I was still not paying enough. I had to pay more
than I was paying....that's for sure. A proven part of my experiences.

I would never worry about that. I figure that someone might buy some someday
and find they want more and cannot find any except some other poets
writings, and that still won't satisfy them and they'll want still more and
more and more, until they have dozens of poetry books on their shelves that
the libraries do not buy and circulate because they are not popular enough
to keep there.

and will be showing some rarely-screened classics of Euro-horror, leading
off with Dario Argento's "Inferno" (1980) (July 10) and winding up with a
double bill of Mario Bava's "Hercules in the Haunted World" (1961) and
"Danger: Diabolik" (1968, also by M. Bava) on the 31st.  And don't forget,

I would like to carp a little more in my ignorant way on this thread since
hey it's the 4th of July weekend and bombs are exploding outside my window
so...
I too remember better days when the government spread its largesse toward the
arts with no strings attached and this is as it should be, let the artists
and their agents decide, okay.  But the idea that artistic merit can be
rewarded irrespective of content and viewpoint sounds like a legal fiction
which allowed the money to keep on flowing.  Consider for example the
purely exemplary [fictional] work of Ugo Tsetsetaviti, who produced
utterly lifelike - with technical merit in the highest degree -
re-enactments of Kristallnacht, in order to glorify Mussolini and the
3rd Reich.  His work, sponsored by Big Nazi Productions, a well-established
arts foundation in Weekawken, somehow never made it through the funding
protocols - despite the high purely artistic quality of the production.
I think it offended some people.  What's my point?  That you can't have
it both ways.  Art hits people in a visceral/political way.  The connoisseurs
of stylish shock understand this better than anyone; their "art" is ALL
"content" - but the gummint ain't sposed tah consider that, see?  The
shock artists want the money - no content considered - AND they want
to "protect their freedom of speech' (to get across their content).
But see, their art hits home - it offends some people.  So the legal
fiction is shown up for what it is, and we enter a performance arena
with Jesse & Karen spreading the chocolate wide and far.

So what's my solution?  Hey, art is a cognitive, political, aesthetical
integral thingum all in one.  Let it happen; let it fly.  An if the
gummint turns down your grant, let people know about that.  We have
to be reminded now and then how we're being channeled into conventional
channels, prim and proper and public and protected and precious and
private and personal and purple and red, white and blue.  But don't
spend too much time in court.  Because you won't get out until you
pay every penny.  That's gospel. On the other hand, don't blame the
gummint if they don't underwrite shock.  No matter how beautiful and
idiosyncratic and individual and free and extraordinary and liberating
it may be.  Cause the gummint got feelings too.  We have met the enemy
an they is us.
- Henry Gould
98 years ago, on the 4th of July 1900, Florence Ainsworth Gould was
born.  A member in good standing of the D.A.R.  There was a painting
of Lafayette dancing at a fancy ball with George Washington
looking on over the dining room table.  There was "Mom" at the head of
the table (blind, over 100 yrs old).  Florence smoked a lot of
cigarettes and drank a lot of daquiris, and had a
big laugh and a sense of humor and died of leukemia in 1964.
Happy 4th of July, refugees.

"Kant's critique concentrated all directed, purposeful processes in
man's rational action, and this meant that the world could participate
in this sort of directness only by becoming a substrate subject to man's
purposes. In its metaphorical usage, the expression of "unfinished
world" no longer legitimates human action by reference to a prescribed
definition and obligatory role in nature. Rather, the transcendental
turning requires that the world must be 'unfinished,' and thus material
at man's disposal, because this is a condition of the possibility of
human action."---from The Legitimacy of the Modern Age by Hans
Blumenberg---cp

Readings

Jim Brashear
Kathy Lou Schultz

Friday, July 10, 8:00 pm


Kathy Lou Schultz is an engaged writer, urgent and cool, whose open
forms
include direct statement and extreme fragmentation... Schultz writes
about
love, work, and physical life at a time when hope is qualified and
nothing
is normal. Re dress is a powerful book.-Robert Glück

[Jim Brashear's go little book] attempts variegated, complex
enunciations
of gender/body/language-raising urgent considerations around the
socialization of sexuality and text (cultural production). In its
allegiance to and innovation of assemblage and issues of
intertextuality,
go little book hones its own particular cadence of the lived body and
the
social body.-Myung Mi Kim


San Francisco-On Friday, July 10 New Langton Arts presents readings by
San
Francisco-based writers Jim Brashear and Kathy Lou Schultz, co-editors
of
Lipstick Eleven, a local magazine of experimental writing.  Jim Brashear
reads selections from his latest works, which focus attention on the
body,
both lived and social.  Recipes written in English, Dutch, Afrikaans,
and
Zulu are fused together in a poetic narrative, whose broken form
describes
how national culture feeds the body/citizen.  Another narrative's
subject
loses its gender, somewhere between a Gothic novel and a bad
science-fiction movie, and comes out paranoid about the concept of
families
and The Shining.  Kathy Lou Schultz reads from both published works and
new
works in progress, including a manuscript entitled "Some Vague Wife," a
romp through sex, gender, intimacy, and power which formally rides the
rails between prose and poetry.  Tickets are $7 general and $5 for
students, seniors and Langton members. The readings begin at 8:00 pm and
are held in Langton's theater at 1246 Folsom Street, between 8th and 9th
streets and three blocks directly south of the Civic Center BART and
Muni
stop, San Francisco.  Please call 415 626 5416 for more information and
reservations.

Jim Brashear studied semiotics at Brown University, poetry at San
Francisco
State University, and computer science at Mills College. He was
Editor-in-Chief for Transfer, the magazine of SFSU's Creative Writing
Department, and is currently co-editing Lipstick Eleven.  Recently
published, Lipstick Eleven explores the relationships between the
literary
journal and the 'zine, the identity of the author and ownership of the
text, writing "created" and writing "found."

In his own writing Brashear's play between texts led him to the play
between different media, particularly the realms of sound and video.
Thus
Brashear will return to Mills this fall to study  electronic music and
multimedia performance.  Projects under development include: a "writing
machine,"in which a computer program weaves together simultaneous "live"
input from writers stationed at different terminals; and a "linguistic
synthesizer," in which speaking sentences into a computer generates
electronic music as an "accompaniment" to the reader.

Kathy Lou Schultz's book of poems, Re dress, won the Michael Rubin Award
from San Francisco State University.  Work from this collection was
anthologized in The New Fuck You (Semiotexte).  Her recent work appears
or
is forthcoming in: Outlet, Fourteen Hills, lyric&, Tripwire, and
Lipstick
Eleven.  Schultz teaches creative writing at San Francisco State
University, co-edits of Lipstick Eleven, and edits SWEAT: International
Labor Magazine of North America.  An Associate Editor at InfoWorld
Magazine, Schultz received her MFA in Creative Writing and American
Literature from San Francisco State University and her BA from Oberlin
College, OH.

It's Kevin Killian.  Here I was telling all Bay Area visitors to see
Argento's "Inferno" on July 10th, and now I've been reminded of a competing
event on the same evening a few blocks away, at New Langton Arts (1246
Folsom) at 8:00 o'clock, a reading by two very estimable writers, Jim
Brashear and Kathy Lou Schultz!  Sorry for the confusion.

Subject:      2nd thoughts on court

I see in the paper today that the Whitney Museum has pulled funding for
a major project involving Karen Finlay.  She & her curators had predicted
this kind of fallout from the Supreme Court ruling.  (article in today's
Times).  My Jack Spandrift devil's advocacy maybe took me over to the
"wrong side of history" so to speak.  This is a shame that conservative
forces in government can protect the public from all but safe and
meretricious forms of art, while the commercial media continues to
pump out mind-numbing garbage at will.  What my previous post on this
issue was trying to say was that in a democracy these kinds of pressures
might be inevitable, since the government politicizes the majority; and
if government funds are involved, it's a legal fiction to suggest that
a government agency can make grants on the basis of pure merit, as if that
could exist without content and a viewpoint on that content.
   I'm just trying to think through this stuff from an unpopular list
perspective, I think that's fun to do, and regret some of the snide
remarks about "shock artists" etc. There is a kind of cultural censorship
going on here, which is a familiar kind of safe repression which appears
all through history.  - Henry Gould

henry, just must jump in here:  this is one of those times where the spirit
saves etc...

no one is denying that content is, ultimately, part of what's judged for an
nea... the nea process is undoubtedly as capricious, full of error and
oversight and overdetermination and so forth, as any other such evaluative
process (esp. one that operates under govt. sanction)... i'm sure content
is judged, reputation is judged, even intention is judged (have you ever
tried to grab hold of an intention?)... just have a close look at the
application form...

the point is that these judgments, from the point of view of some on this
list (i would hope most, if not all), are best left to artists/poets/etc...
that a trustee relationship *should* prevail between the public and its
government representatives on this matter (and don't let's start getting
into whether representatives must be, in all senses, mere delegates of the
public will---the pentagon don't work this way either, e.g.)...

that a given work "offends" will of course be taken into account in any
case---as you correctly intuit, and as a practical matter, simply b/c the
entities doing the judging are human, and social beings... yet the supreme
court's decision is problematic not simply b/c it threatens to censor work
that is already produced, but b/c it will have the effect of drawing a
tighter circle around that which is produced and submitted for a
grant---i.e., smaller deviation from the norm, as the statisticians say...
granted [wink], not everyone need apply for an nea, and the work of those
who do will in any case represents only a small portion of gross artistic
product (gap, ha)...

but *if* you believe the arts (among other things) in this country are
under *public* attack by a right-wing mentality out to restore "decency" to
schools and the like---i do, and i judge this mself, in part, on the basis
of what i see going on in other sectors of our "economy," and in other
countries---why then i think you must concede that the supreme court ruling
plays to this tendency... how?... well, by de facto making content a public
issue in a very specific way (on the basis of "offense," let's say)---which
is not simply making public that which was always the case, henry... it's
making the content issue public so as to discourage a potentially wider
range of publicly-supported art (i'll leave aside the question here of who
gets to decide who does the judging---but it's not hard to imagine what
might happen in this regard)...

capisce?... you can't have it 'both ways,' no... but what's good for the
goose:  if you're gonna point out that content has always been an issue,
you have as well to point out that---whatever the various nea panels have
rendered in terms of content evaluation---nobody has actually *regulated*,
constitutionally, the nature of that issue... till now, that is...

best,

Nichirin continues: "All the other Buddhas from the worlds through the ten

A prepuce of flesh, Nikuko thinks, a foreskin of the world. Nichin adds,
below: "The _Amida_ Sutra states that Buddhas covered a major world system
with their broad, long tongues, but lacks the truth that such a gesture
would substantiate. The _Hannya_ Sutra tells how the Buddha's tongue cov-
ered the major world system and radiated infinite light when he expounded
the _Hannya._ Yet this cannot be a proof [comparable to that of the _Jin-
riki_ chapter]. Since these two sutras are mere provisional teachings,
they obscured the Buddha's enlightenment in the remotest past." (Selected

On the whole, Morpheal seems to be talking about either a new dispensation
or a rather large underground in Ontario. George is right about the small
presses I know about. They publish poetry; they pay the writers, often in
copies, & they try to distribute, some managing that much better than
others. But when I speak of such presses as Brick Books , Coach House Press
(the once) & Coach House Books (and future), Turnstone, Talonbooks, Coteau
Books, ECW Press, Quarry Press, and many others, I speak of publishers that
are at least business-like. And when I was a publisher, Longspoon Press
paid its writers. And found the money to publish through sales & grants.
The Canada Council has helped a lot of publishers, but in a country with
such a small population (& sitting next to the elephant) we need the help.
I do think that in the lean & mean nineties, a lot of younger writers have
been forced back to chapbooks & to self-publishing. Some of what appears is
good, some bad; as a matter of fact, that's usually the case with 'real'
publishers too...

Readings are another matter. Some are supported by the Canada Council, &
for those the writer gets travel plus an honorarium. Some venues, like
universities, have some money for readers, but not usually for travel. Then
there are local readings where usually it's local writers who participate.
two years ago, I was able to have Tony Lopez here with the help of the
British Council, John Kinsella with the help of the Australian Council;
last year the British Council helped bring the great Tom Raworth to Alberta
-- without such help we could not have afforded these writers. But that's
always the case, isn't it? George came here this past winter with the aid
of the Canada Council, & as Billy Little said of the reading the other day,
his audience left in a good mood...

This person has very scant knowledge. Here are some small presses that pay
their poets: Talonbooks, RDC Press, Turnstone Press, NeWest, Pulp, New
Star, 5th House, Exile, ECW, Vehicule, Thistledown. I would offer the names
of some that ask you to pay them, but, frankly, I have not heard of any.

That might be true, George, but we have only the knowledge we are given to
have by those who give it. I mentionned my affiliation, and without mentionning
the significant individuals I assure you that they are not insignificant. A
few are actually publishers in their own right, and claim to know the
industry extremely well, being members of the small press association.

Also why is it that every poet I have met has paid to publish their own, or
has won a chapbook as a prize in a contest. That's it. That is all I have
ever met in person and been able to talk to, anywhere where I have been
invited.

So, can we decipher what happened to mislead me, and many others, so badly ?
Is there a conspiracy ?   Who is behind it ?   Why is there a conspiracy ?

Perhaps rhetorical questions, but they do come to mind.

They began their life as rye bread, and had started to turn a shade of green.

The penicilin on them probably helped stave off infections, contributing
to the probability of survival.

I found that green cheddar is also edible without any ill effects.

I add only that I was also generously offered, by a good publisher friend,
a chance to publish some of my visual art for a price aforementionned of
approximately $5,000. It was suggested as a second effort, rather than my
buying another poetry book. (He meant black and white renditions,
rather than full colour litho, but he was also showing me a sample of a full
colour litho book of visual art that had been locally self published, paid
for by the artist to whet my apetite for a larger venue for my visual work.)

I repeat that I am a member of the Canadian Poetry Association and no one
from that group has ever mentionned any such thing. Even the anthologies,
as good as they are, were pay for print. There was some really nice work
compiled in a few of them. Each poet has to pay around $14 and send in a
few poems. That pays for the publication.

As for members ever even hearing about presses that publish poetry without
cost to the poet, I have no knowledge of any such thing from anyone.

The organization has a sizeable membership.

Here the small presses control the readings. As I said before.
No new book published locally, no reading, no publicity. I do not, from my
association with local poets, whether established or new at it, know of
anything different. I am absolutely floored at what I am currently reading
on this list, as being an "alternate reality".

Are we talking about the same planet ?  I am having extreme difficulty
reconciling my experiences among poets here, with what is being said by a
few of the list members. They are radically in opposition to one another as
though two entirely different cultural and ideological systems.

If that is my experience, then it must also be the experience of other poets.
I am not that unique. Other than, perhaps, that I ask about opportunities,
when I meet those I know, and follow up on what I hear about. Now I feel
like my "best friends" have led me right into the wall, at full speed ahead
at midnight. I know that I was not uniquely misled. I know there are others.
That same wall seems to be covered from top to bottom in the metaphoric
"blood" of splattered poets. From what I could see on the one side there
appeared to be no other side, only the edge of the known world to fall off from.

Now I feel as if my "best friends" are either as ignorant as I apparently was,
or that they are so violently and unscrupulously competitive as to put their
fellow poets into the ground without a fighting chance. That might include
those that said nothing "helpful" as well as those that said something
"helpful".

No. I insist that it does not make the world go round. It flattens=
 everything.
It makes for a flat earth. Steamrollered flat. Flat effect. Everything
flattened out. Completely flattened out. Absolutely pancaked. Either that or
melted down from rushing around and around and around on a flat world.....

It is such a heavy thing. Money that is. Heavy to have. Heavy to hold. Heavy
burden not to have any. From any angle it is so heavy. It can flatten out
anything completely and absolutely and make it remain that way forever. Then
again, it seems appropriate it is made by pressure in a press, in a process
that involves huge pressures......giving it its essential character. Coins
come from a die press. Paper money from a printing press. Supposedly that is
to make us fear change the most. It rattles at us and rattles us. It has the
temperament of a rattlesnake. When money pressure strikes at us the venom
goes in deep.

>        Oh give me Money that's what I want

No. I insist that was _NOT_ what it was about.

It was not about vanity either.

It was not about a quest for fame either.=20

I keep saying it was about art and it was about love. Those two being
different subjects, but then someone wants to concatenate and twist those
together, and put it through the same flattening out pressure.....It was
also about communication.

So, perhaps that condemns to eternal _hellfire_.=20

Anyway.....here is something about "Money". More blasphemies no doubt.

I do not usually write this kind of thing. First one act play I ever wrote.
However, it answers better than anything else i have handy right now.

MONEY         A play in one act.          By: Morpheal aka Bob Ezergailis
-----

Dramatis Personae:

Young Man: Dressed in a business suit. Wearing a tie and uncomfortable
leather             shoes.
Young Woman: Wearing a pant suit and a negligee under the jacket.
Money Bag: Canvas bag with dollar signs on it. Money is inside. Also a tape
recorder. The tape recorder plays softly but audibly all the time
from inside the sack. It is an overdub of fragments of stock
quotations and business news previously recorded by several other
voices from actual current news.
Doctor: A doctor, dressed conservatively for the office, carrying a doctor's
bag.
Various Bystanders: The audience.

Scene: Somewhere on a city street in a large metropolitan area.

As the act opens a young man and a young woman are carrying a large canvas
sack. It has large black dollar signs painted on front and back. They are
straining with the load. It is very heavy and gets heavier and heavier for
them as they proceed down the street.

The young woman drops to her knees and they rest the sack on the ground. She
is wiping her brow from what is obviously becoming severe over-exertion and
exhaustion.

Young woman: I don't know how much further I can go with this.
Young man: We have to keep going.  (He looks nervously over this shoulder.)
We            have a long way to go.=20
Young woman: How far ?
Young man: To the end of the road.
Young woman: How far is that ?
Young man: I don't know. I never met anyone who has been there.
Young woman (sobbing): How did we get ourselves into this ?
Young man: What else could we do ? =20
Young woman (exasperated): I don't know. How would I know. You should know.
Young man: Why ? Because I am a man ?  I don't know. I simply don't know.
Young woman: You know I didn't mean it that way.=20
Young man: I bet you didn't. Now grab your end of it and lets keep going.

They grab the sack again and heave it up and begin to stagger some ways
further with it.

Young woman: It feels so much heavier. I don't think I can go much further.
Young man: We can't stop now. We can't stop here. We'll never make it if we
stop            here.
Young woman: Let's rest a while.=20

They sit either side of it, on the sidewalk, with their backs to it.

Young woman: Do you remember how much fun we used to have ?
Young man: Before we made it ?
Young woman: Yeah. You used to come home for dinner.=20
Young man: But we were poor. It was horrible to be poor.=20
Young woman: We used to spend the weekend at your uncle's cabin. No one for
miles around.You used to kiss me, and we had candles. It was
romantic.
Young man: You want me to kiss you ?
Young woman: It would be nice. (Looking dreamy eyed.)
Young man: Ok....

He puckers his lips, turns and leans around to one side of the sack, while
she puckers her lips and leans around the other side of sack. She is looking
at his behind while he is looking at her's.

Young woman: Where are you ? Come over here.

They each turn around the other way and soon she is looking around the other
side of the sack at his behind while he is looking around the opposite side
of the sack from where he was at her behind. (They are now doing the same
from opposite directions.)

Young man: Over here. Where are you ?
Young woman: Over here. Where are you ?

He is looking near the bottom of the sack. She is looking over the top of
the sack.=20

Young woman: (exasperated) Never mind.=20
Young man: Where are you ?
Young woman: Forget it. I'm too tired anyway, and we have to be going. We
will              never make it to the end of the road if we don't hurry.
Young man: You're right. We have to hurry. Do you think you can make it ?
Young woman: I'll try. I have to try, don't I?  Did I ever let you down=
 before?
Young man: No. You never let me down before.  You never let me down and I
never            let you down.
Young woman: That's right.  So let's go.

They grab the sack and lug it along some few yards further.

Young man: (Gasping) I feel a pain....
Young woman: You alright ?
Young man: No. Pain in my chest.  (Clutching left chest drops to his knee.)
Young woman: What's wrong ?  You going to be alright ?  We have to make it
to              the end of the road.
Young man: Can't breathe. Pains in my chest.....
Young woman: Do you need a doctor ?
Young man: No. No. Don't need a doctor. I'll be alright. In a minute or two.
Young woman: I'm worried. You know I can't do this alone. I need you.
Young man: I know you need me. Don't worry. We'll make it.=20
           The end of the road can't be very far from here.
Young woman: I hope not. I'm so very tired. Seems we have been at this=
 forever.
Young man: Not so very long, really. Seems like we began only yesterday. It
goes            so fast.
Young woman: The pain's gone ?
Young man: Almost. A few deep breaths and I'll be alright......(breathing
deeply, still in pain).
Young woman: Good. You had me worried. I don't know what I would do without=
 you.

They grab the sack again and heave it painfully up off the ground. They
continue on a few staggering paces. The young man puts the sack down and
falls gasping to the ground..

Young woman: What happened ? =20

Holding on to her side of the sack, she reaches over with one hand and
nudges at him. There is no response. She starts to cry hysterically.=20

Young woman: What am I going to do ? (crying)  How will I get to the end of
the              road ?

She grabs the sack and tries to heave it along a few more steps. Then she
too collapses. A doctor happens to be passing the fallen couple. The doctor
rushes towards them.

Doctor: Stand aside please. Stand aside. Give them room to breathe. I'm a
medical doctor. Anyone know what happened here ?  Does anyone know who
these people are ?

There is no answer.

The doctor puts down the doctor bag and opens it. Takes out a stethoscope.
Begins to take the young woman's pulse with one hand upon her wrist. The
doctor's other hand reaches into the sack very  discretely, pulling out a
handful of paper money. The money is quickly shoved into one of the doctor's
pockets.=20

Doctor: There now. There is not much I can do for her. She has reached the
end         of the road. Let me take a look at him.....Might be he has a
better        chance.=20

Doctor reaches one hand into the money bag again and pulls out another
handful of paper money while taking the young man's pulse with the other=
 hand.=20

Doctor: Nothing here either. Nothing to be done. I am too late. He has
reached         the end of his road.
             =20
Then the doctor places the stethoscope onto the Money bag and listens
carefully.=20
The doctor then begins to work on it. Soon the bag is lying down on its=
 side.

Doctor: I think I can do something for this one. Let's see, what have we
here.....

The doctor pulls out another handful of money and stuffs into an already
bulging pocket. Soon two legs emerge from the bottom of the sack. They are
green and barefoot. A few moments later a green head emerges from the top of
the sack. The doctor helps the sack to its feet and the sounds of stock
quotations and business news grows louder from inside it.

Money Bag giggles. Makes a hop, and a skip and a jump. Twirls around and
looks at the bystanders with a merry twinkle in its eyes, while the doctor
packs the doctor's bag and picks it up.

Doctor: Well, well, one out of three is not bad. Now you take it easy, and
look         after your circulation. You do not want to end up like those
other              two.....Best come by my office next Monday. I'll give you
a thorough            check up. Here's my card. At 10 would be best......=20

Doctor drops the card into the money bag.  Grabs another handful of paper
money. Starts to take it from the bulging pocket and starts to count it and
shuffle it into a neater pile . The Money bag runs off towards the end of
the road. The doctor shakes head at the dead couple and follows the Money
bag in the same direction towards the end of the road.

                   The End [of the road].

"It will serve our purposes if we first state that Bohr was not a

reminded me of two remarks Bohr made when we were working together at
his institute. One of them was made after Bohr had addressed a congress
of positivist philosophers. Bohr was deeply disappointed by their
friendly accceptance of all he had said about quantum theory, and he
told us: "If a man does not feel dizzy when he first learns of the
quantum of action, he has not understood a word." They accepted quantum
theory as an expression of experience, and it was their Weltanschauung
to accept experience; Bohr's problem, however, was precisely how such a
thing as a quantum of action can possibly be an experience."---from The

write into the thin air, in a format hidden by snarled wires, tags, broken

I wonder what poets you have met. Did you say that you were in hamilton,
the home of David mcFadden, who published poems with Talonbooks and
McClelland & Stewart, two publishers that pay for poems and advertise the
books? Maybe you should go to Toronto, and attend some poetry readings. Or
see if they still have them at McMaster Univ. or the Community College
whose name I forget, a coupld places I have read, havinghad my air travel
paid and getting a fee. You might get a chance to talk to a poet who gets
his poems published without paying for the privilege.

What is the "Canadian Poetry Association"? I have been around poetry in
Canada for a long time, and I have never heard of this organization. I have
a sneaking hunch that you may have made it up, just to get a strange
conversation going. One has, of course, heard of the League of Canadian
Poets, and of the Writers Union of Canada. But this CPA sounds like you're
kidding.

The work of art, including literary art, becomes inherently incomprehensible
exactly at that same moment as excessive paranoia causes the artist producer
of the work of art to fear being communicatively understood. This is the
very essence of what becomes the modern work of art, situated as it was, at
its very inception in a period of two massive global conflagrations, the
world wars, and all the massive political machinations that have been
struggling to captivate completely the minds of humankind. Increasing
artistic abstraction
becomes becomes the political response of submission to any meaning that
anyone might read into the work of art. It the reduction of meaning to that
meaning which means avoidance of intentional communicative interaction
between artist and audience, mediated by the work of art itself, in paranoid
fear that something might be said wrong. If something is said wrong then the
apparent blindfold over the artist's eyes, the tied hands, and the gagged
voice, might end in the firing squad loosing its final volley at the
producer of the work.
This is where many have lived in many places, during most of this 20th century.

Bohr apparently realized that he had become initiate, albeit in a different
system of metaphors, as to something of the most occult science of magick.
He knew already that microcosmic events, quantum events, could give rise to
macrocosmic events. That mirroring between above and below being a
fundamental principle of magickal lore, as to magickal correspondences and
effects. It was a short leap from that realization to the realization that
the microcosmic quantum events within the brain could give rise to
macrocosmic events in the world, as an apparently synchronistic causality,
in a similar manner as to how chaos theorists later speculated how the wings
of a microcosmic insect on one side of the world could give rise to a huge
storm on the other side of the world. We might imagine then, how the
"quantum of action" mediates between correspondences
of microcosm to macrocosm. With the rise of quantum theory in science we
would then have less and less reason to doubt that magick is also equally true.

What you call 'incomprehensibility' is a product of specialization within
the artworld in the absence of a concrete register of narratives
authorized by, oh, say the church. And I'd go farther back than the world
wars for the emergence of 'the modern art object,' whatever that actually
is; even good old Jansen puts it at 1850 in certain places,1900 in
others...  you could say, though, that the precedent is set by the freedom
from patronage enjoyed by certain quattrocento artists....

KEROUAC COTTAGE WILL BE  PLACE FOR WRITERS

By Leslie Doolittle


>>>Remember that cottage in College Park where author Jack Kerouac lived in 1957---the year_ On the Road_ became the bible of the beat generation?

It's about to become a literary landmark.

A newly formed non-profit corporation is buying the home on Clouser Avenue and will announce plans Saturday to use it for an author-in-residence project tied to Rollins College (Winter Park, FL)

On hand for the announcement at Chapter's Bookshop on Saturday will be John and Jim Sampras, Kerouac's brother-in-law and nephew; David Amram, Jack's pal and musical collaborator; and Douglas Brinkley, who is writing Kerouac's authorized biography.

For more info, call Marty Cummins at Chapter's Bookshop (407) 246-1546.<<<

Besides the more obvious forms--like deleting passages or refusing
funding--there exist more subtle forms, some of which i think of as market
or economic censorship.
the small scale of poetry publishing, even comparing the largest runs of
poetry books to 'popular' fiction. we're told there's no audience for
poetry, but advertising, public relations etc sure have excelled over the
decades at creating markets.
the growing corporate media monopolies, that cut across the old boundaries
to combine movies, TV, magazines and book publishers under one corporate
gavel, creating media superstars, tot he exclusion of so many other
artists. with fewer 'products' out there, issues are so much easier to
contain.
the money spent to promote one john grisham novel could produce full-length
poetry books by everyone in the POETICS group and 5 of their friends [i'm
wildly guessing on the numbers, but heck, this is chat not a research
paper]--allocation of resources is a great tool of censorship: if its not
published or recorded or broadcast no one else can pick up on the ideas, be
inspired or inflamed by the artists observations.
this promotion of national, mass-culture also seriously erodes local
culture, local artists. this may be just a side effect of the markets
larger scheme of eroding community to create more markets (i'm planning to
print up bumper stickers to say "Community is the opposite of capitalism,"
tho the reverse, while more negative, is more to the point--since community
involves sharing with others, and capitalism involves nothing being free.)

one indeed cannot steer wrong w. anything from 1977--but I particularly like
DP11 for a number of reasons:

--better set/album, imo, than Europe '72--although Bobby is still deep into
cowboy phase (Me & My Uncle, El Paso, etc.), Keith Godchaux has not yet hit
his I-will-only-play-a-grand-piano phase, & the keyboard side really
sparkles--also there are only 2 of those famous long random yowls from Donna--

--two words: "Dark Star"--

--Garcia is energetic & all over the place--relatively good voice (best
guitarist in the universe but never was no Pavarotti)--a treat

hope this helps
Gwyn

mr. morpheal,

first let me say that i'm behind on my readings and if this gets addressed
inthe next 48 posts i apologise.

and now the post:

i'm not sure what youare talking about. i also live in Sowesto and also
put on
readings. i have never had anyone pay me to read. for the last 5 years
i have been organizing readings in galleries and pubs. the crowds have
averaged about 47(witha max of 73 on one hot june night) yes i have been
paid by the pub- once i took the 25 bucks from the barman and gave it to
poet from hamilton to feed her boyfriend's camero. and yes i usually get a
few pints out of the evening. but the reason i do it, whether cris cheek
from london proper or modo press from peterborough is because i like
putting on shows. i think spending a day postering with a borrowed walkman
is better than lovely.

as for the canadian poetry association, they couldn't organize a piss up
in a brewery. i know wayne ray(he has in fact read at one of my gigs) and
he was blown away by the size of the crowd. i know i am lucky to have such
success but i work pretty hard at getting people out to shows and making
sure the poets and the venue people are happy.

yes, in canada, with shrinking arts money, the poet has to be the cook the
thief the wife and her lover but stop whining about it and do something. i
don't expect the canada council to give me any cash so i just do it myself
and find friends of likewise enthusiasm.

the english department at my school does sweet frog all to promote
creative writing but i don't see joining the plague of canadian poets as a
cure-all to salve the wound this omision leaves.

if it can happen in londonOnt it can happen anywhere.

best,
kevin hehir

It really is hard to know how to respond to Morpheal's postings on this
matter. But I think he has if not been misled at least not been told
everything. Let's see. As George & I have pointed out, there are a number
of small presses in Canada which publish poetry & pay their writers. Alas,
alas, that ever writer wrote, there are so many more writers writing than
there are publishers publishing that each of these publishers must make
choices. One editor of such a press told me last year that they were booked
for at least the next 5 years, & had had to turn back over 200 mss they
thought worthy of publication. But they can only afford to do about 8 books
per year (as Charles Alexander also pointed out). In fact, publishing a
book is a rather longish process, even with a completed, well edited, ms, &
so with a small staff (& all small presses have very small staffs), getting
out even those 8 books per year (or 10, or 12) is quite an effort. So, yes,
undoubtedly, in Canada (& I'm sure in the US), there are far more
unpublished poetry mss than there are published books. How the choice of
what gets published is made is what grates for many. The publishers will
insist they publish the best of what they receive; but each of them has its
own aesthetic (political, economic, philosophical, etc.) agenda. Many on
this list would feel that Norton, say, often shows very poor taste in its
choices, for example. Anyway: the publishers are there; most of them behave
ethically. But there are all those poets out there who haven't found them,
or have submitted and been turned down, or.... That's how it goes in the
nineties, in Canada (& elsewhere), in our world. And, yes, any number of
younger writers have gone the way of self-publishing chapbooks, or of
starting their own magazines; but it has been ever thus ... hasn't it?

In any case, it's not incomprehensible. The translation is given below of
course. And the substitution is simple - using a name like jennifer to
replace a vowel, with the vowel in the middle like jennEifer to make sure
it's read. I used a simple c program to do the substitutions.

I wanted a text that hides itself, but just so much - as well as a text
that teeters on the edge of noise. I wanted a different sound. I wanted
something that presented an easy way into its hermeneutics, that gave
credence to the letter.

I have seen hardly any audiences of that size (47) at a gallery or pub
around here. Also, here, mostly only other local poets, which is not really
what it ought to be about.

I do not expect to ever get a dime of grant money. That is a different story.

Perhaps it was my age. I am 44.

I might have been marginalized by younger, better connected, poets.

It is worse than you imply, though on a deeper and more pervasive thread
than simply the matter of pay to publish or be published and paid. That is
only one issue amongst many, even if not the smallest of the issues. It
appears I have been worse than misled, over the years, and I have not
properly discerned what a friend is and what a ruthless competitor is, into
the bargain.

Right now, my intuitive feel for it all is that my throat was cut, my tongue
was torn out and my poetic voice largely silenced, by misinformation,
disinformation, and marginalization, ageism and youthism, and academicism,
and a few other isms throw in to boot. I was given the work of a Sisyphus
and eventually the boulder was simply meant to wear away my energy,
enthusiasm, my means for doing it, as well as my artistic progress. It has
been effective at doing that. I am so tired to being asked to go a long
distance to read to a dozen fellow poets, if anywhere, that I do not even
pursue readings out of town anymore. I had no idea there was anything
better. It was all I was shown of the poetic world, in terms of accessibility.

I seem to have missed the boat, because I was told by any I knew to talk to
that the boat was not there. Either that or that we were already on it and
on our way to the only destinations there were available. Either that or my
knee caps were broken by a poetry thugs tire iron to keep me at dockside.

I was being killed and gutted while still believing that those doing it were
doing their utmost to make a mutual success of it. How could I be so
absolutely, preposterously, naive.

I will not bore you, or the other list members with the details of the whole
experience. I know now that I was wasting my time completely, spinning my
wheels, getting nowhere. Perhaps it is all that I deserved in terms of
poetic merit. I cannot argue that point. However, I would have expected
honesty in that regard from those I came upon, rather than hearing of
laurels and being led to the idea that where we are is as far as anyone goes.

>But there are all those poets out there who haven't found them,
>or have submitted and been turned down, or.... That's how it goes in the
>nineties, in Canada (& elsewhere), in our world. And, yes, any number of

I agree there is a diversity.

What has absolutely knocked me suddenly to the floor is that reputable,
supposedly established, as well as up and coming, people who do poetry were
all leading me to the belief that everyone pays to be published and no one
is ever published anymore unless they pay to be published. They kept saying
poetry does not sell. No one ever makes anything at this, not even costs.

What planet am I on. Who is truth. Who is lie. Who is doublespeak.
I now have two very contrasting versions of "reality".

The one I was made to live within and the one on this list that is the
experience of some others and seems equally true and reasonable. My
worldview, my framework, has collapsed. The poetry world is not at all what
it seemed
to be, and it as though I never knew any of it at all.

All of language is full of encryptions: the words and phrases being
composites of meaningful sounds. It might be considered that language as
suicide note is only the submission in response to language as death threat.
All of one's competitors are constantly uttering death threats in any
sphere, including the poetic. The poet residing within the sphere of social
Darwinism, technocratic tendencies, and within the domain of competition
with rival species as well as within species, is besieged, and urged to
complete what the competitors have not yet completed ?  Is that the world we
live in. I sometimes wonder. When do we get to experience anything else ?
Is that only a naive dream, of a future that can never be attained, except
in poetic fiction ?

Joe, thanks for your response.  I went & read both O'Connor's
ruling & Souter's dissent. (thanks Ron.) I was more convinced by
O'Connor's argument that within a political context in which the
decency/respect clause was a compromise measure allowing the NEA to
continue at all, the difference between the NEA using this guideline
among others - content being recognized as an inseparable part of
"artistic merit" - in order to award grants on the one hand, and the
1st Amendment right of free speech, on the other, is clear.  Souter
argues that the 1st Amendment denies the government the right to
consider viewpoint in this process.  O'Connor's position is more
realistic: this is not a free speech issue but an issue of how the NEA
is to continue providing arts grants in a divisive "multicultural"
society. As long as the decency/respect clause is purely advisory, the
NEA and funded artists are protected from suits which actually deny grants,
and there is no ruling outlawing the right to fund "indecent" art as long
as artistic merit outweighs the decency consideration.

By "realistic" I mean that as I see it realism implies the understanding
that if the artist is seeking government funding for a project, then
he/she should be aware that not only the constitutional issues are
involved, but the sensibilities of the whole spectrum of the public.
This is what I meant by saying earlier that "the shock artists understand
this better than anyone".  By saying they want it both ways, I am saying
that their art is created (1) to shock sensibilities, to epater le bourgois,
and (2) they want the full protection of the law not only to continue that
project but to receive government funds to do so.  By "realistic" I am
saying that O'Connor's ruling recognizes that the body politic is not only
a legal entity but a "body" endowed with sensibility (repressed as it may be),
and as a result, the funds may not always be forthcoming.  If this scandal
brings to light the limitations of our democracy with respect to enlightened
support for the arts, it might also bring to light the limitations of a
legalistic approach to government arts funding.

O'Connor noted in her historical review of the case that Finley & her co-
suitors were paid in full (after the lower court ruling) for grants not
received as well as attorney's fees.

Stadium Projects announces the opening of:

Kenneth Goldsmith with Clem Paulsen FIDGET
        http://stadiumweb.com/fidget


FIDGET is a java applet programmed by Clem Paulsen based on Kenneth
Goldsmith's _FIDGET_, a transcription of recordings by Goldsmith in which
he spoke every body movement he made for thirteen hours on June 16, 1997
(Bloomsday). Goldsmith and Paulsen's collaboration have reconfigured the
text of FIDGET to substitute the human body with the computer. The java
applet reduces the text of FIDGET into its constituent elements of words
and phrases. The relationships between these elements is structured by a
dynamic mapping system that is organized visually and spatially instead of
grammatically. In addition, the java applet invokes duration and presence.
The applet is divided into 'chapters' for each of thirteen hours. Each time
the applet is downloaded it begins at the approximate time of day it is
being viewed and every mouse click or drag that the user initiates is
reflected in the visual mapping system. The sense of time is reinforced by
differing font sizes, background colors and degree of "fidgetness" for each
hour (these parameters may also be altered by the user) and the diminishing
contrast and eventual fading away of each phrase as seconds pass. FIDGET is
a collaboration between Stadium, the Whitney Museum of American Art at
Philip Morris, and Printed Matter.  A collaboration with Goldsmith and
vocalist Theo Bleckmann commissioned by the Whitney Museum of American Art,
is made available online at Stadium via Real Audio. The text of FIDGET is
also available online. The complete text of FIDGET along with an
accompanying CD will be published this Fall by the Maryland Institute of
Art.

"The paper has become, arguably, the single most important document in
the field. Almost every history written about the computer, or about
[John] von Neumann, credits him with the idea of the stored memory
computer. Among scientists, computers are to this day known as von
Neumann machines.
Von Neumann was not the originator of the stored-program computer. As we
have seen, the idea for such a machine was being discussed at the Moore
School a year before von Neumann arrived on the scene, and [J. Presper]
Eckert had written a memo on the subject almost six months before von
Neumann had even heard about the Moore School project....
Why did von Neumann let the record stand? Eckert had a story and a
theory, although it must be kept in mind that Eckert is not a
disinterested witness.
"We were in a railroad station, and a bunch of us were getting a meal,"
he related, "and when they were supposed to bring separate checks but
didn't. When the girl arrived with this check and people said, 'Von
Neumann, you're the mathematician,' and handed it to him as a joke. He
looks it over and checks it out, and says, 'They forgot to put my crab
shells on the bill. Other than that its all right. And this raises an
ethical problem.' They said, 'What's that?' And he said, ' To take the
saving myself or divide it among the rest of you.' Of course, he ignored
the third possibility.

RE: Conditions for Writing

CONDITIONS FOR WRITING
Sat 4 July, Connaught Hall, London

About 30-40 people gathered for an all-day event marking the end of the
King's Talk series organised by Bob Perelman during his year-long stay in=

London.

Due to my incompetence in reading the starting time, I arrived as Cris
Cheek and Sianed Jones were in full flow demonstrating/expounding on
"performance". Sianed's violin and voice as ever were in stunning
synchronicity, while Cris remains a master of the ebb from fixed text to
improvisation.

Miles Champion opened a segment on "scenes, values, generations, gender" =
by
drawing attention to the work of some younger poets in North America with=

whom he felt an affinity, including Rod Smith, Brian Kim Stefans and Jeff=

Derksen. His presentation was engaging and uplifting and flew by too fast=
=2E
Karlien van den Beukel, visibly nervous, followed with a presentation on
poetry communities or the lack of them, drawing on a hilarious/horrific
correspondence with certain "Cambridge school poets", identified (as in t=
he
film Reservoir Dogs) only by the colours Pink, White, Blue, etc.

Drew Milne and Caroline Bergvall discoursed on the difficulties of
reconciling academic, creative and polemic practices. While they were
admirably lucid and insightful, I found this segment of less use to me
personally.

This densely packed morning ended with an "interactive reading" in which
the above mentioned (minus Sianed) were joined by Khaled Hakim and Andrew=

Duncan for a poorly rehearsed (non rehearsed) panel game whose purpose wa=
s
unclear. They ended up, at Bob Perelman's suggestion, reading each other'=
s
poems. Miles Champion's reading of Karlien van den Beukel's poem, and Cri=
s
Cheek of Caroline Bergvall's, were highlights.

Lunch. A core group found their way to an Indian restaurant in Drummond
Street, a few others headed for the pub, some lost souls spent the interv=
al
I know not where.

The afternoon session, which began a good 40 minutes late, contained the
first real longueur of the day. Andrew Duncan, misjudging the situation,
read a paper on "Impersonality, Legitimacy and Prestige in Modern Poetry"=

in rather a quiet monotone. What I heard of it was interesting, but Andre=
w
reacted badly to being reminded by Bob that he was overrunning, and
insisted on finishing the paper. With over half an hour gone and no end i=
n
sight, the audience started getting restless, and one or two asked him to=

summarise the rest. Andrew declined, abandoning the paper instead. By way=

of contrast, he was followed by Khaled Hakim, who, in an entertaining
performance that parodied Nietzche and Eastern mysticism while making use=

of a flipchart, harangued the audience on "The Way to Nothingness". =


During the round table discussion that followed, Khaled was taken to task=

for nihilism. He responded cheerfully. I felt his act, based entirely upo=
n
an attack on the avant garde poetry community (as obscure a target as you=

could wish) was puzzlingly pointless, and wished he would use his undoubt=
ed
satiric talents in more productive ways. The discussion continued - about=

an hour and a half past the promised finish time, it was beginning to dri=
ft
towards chat, and, the basement room being somewhat airless, my friend an=
d
I left. A patchily interesting conclusion to what has been a mostly
excellent series of talks. Many thanks to Bob for getting us British poet=
ry
folk (London chapter) to start talking to each other. What will we do aft=
er
he's gone?

henry, thanx...

if we take it to the question of "artistic merit," then, we're stuck
wondering why so many hairs are being split for what is, i think it fair to
say, a relatively small (and gettings smaller) *national* endowment... that
is, "quality," "excellence" and the like are deployed helter-skelter
throughout our institutions (profit, non-profit, postsecondary incl.),
often with little if any concern for what these words actually *mean*...

but here comes something called "art," so i guess 'we the people' (the
govt. that is) must split hairs here?... must be sure it doesn't "offend,"
as though "the quality goes in/before the name goes on" doesn't offend?...

you get my drift... i read the situation over at the nea as, again, part &
parcel of a larger political reality... i don't read it as a primarily
*legal* or intellectual debate about the nature of judging art---though of
course, once it goes to the supreme court, that's the way it's treated (but
how did it get there in the first place?)---and i don't read it as a matter
of public domain ethix (which, as i'm trying to suggest, are entirely
fraught in so many ways when it comes to that which is advertised---or, to
put it another way, just about everything)... clearly there *are*
constitutional issues at stake, and i can already hear the conservatives
arguing that 'public funding of the arts is a matter of constitutional
law'... but in a ruthless economy like ours, where huge public funding goes
to 'high-quality' weapons systems, that claim falls on my deaf ears,
anyway---there's more injustice to be sought elsewhere, and art, at its
best, helps point the way(s)... so perhaps the question that needs to be
asked is, why the lack of faith in art, as opposed to the pentagon?... or
is this manufactured too?...

cbs's 'sunday morning' did a feature spot yesterday, btw, on the new
director of the nea, former head of the country music association, bill ivy
(if i've spelled his name right)... guy holds two masters degrees---one in
folklore, one in ethnomusicology... nobody in congress objected to
appointing him head---which should at least raise an eyebrow or two... this
guy makes the bluebird cafe (in nashville) one of his regular hangouts...
on the surface, i kinda like this, but---thing is, in his first public
address, he indicated that everyone should be listening closely to what was
being said by congress re the nea (read, and i'm not alone here,
*capitulation*)... this guy is an antique maven, and in the very last
segment, the reporter flew off into the wild blue yonder with ivy, him
piloting his restored yellow 1939 piper scout---her saying that this might
be symbolic of his leadership of the nea... i thought it was a clever way
to conclude the piece, suggesting perhaps movement forward with an eye
toward history (ivy's take, no doubt), OR a sort of retro progression
(mine)...

well anyway... thanx for the back & forth on this...

best,

joe

Joe, my lens on this is narrow (maybe fogged); when you get gov't funding for
art you inevitably get all the legal/political baggage along with it, &
I just found the O'Connor ruling making more sense than Souter.
Her review of the history, if I remember right, quoted some advisory panel
on the "artistic merit" issue - or maybe it was a congressperson - saying
what you said, that judging "quality" is not an exact science.
  But what you say about the larger perspective - the draconian attacks on
NEA in the context of other "funding" issues - the whole repressive
atmosphere in a "market" environment which is its opposite or evil twin -
should be the theme of somebody's truly political art - a lot of potential
for comedy there - Henry

henry, thanx again...

i think some of the very same issues we're discussing were drudged up a few
years back... to be bookish about it, and apologies for the lack of full
citations, but i've dug out michael c. dorf's "artifactions:  the battle
over the nea" (my copy repro'd in _the brookings review_, winter 93; dorf
argues reasonably for a rethinking of this approx. 30 year old institution,
but w/o trying to make art "safe" for the world, or vice versa)... and a
piece from (i think it's) steven c. dabin's _arresting images_ (routledge,
92, pp. 278-293; nice history of the conflicting issues)...

yes, i wish preston sturges were still around to have a go at this!... it's
not about *rights*, exactly---it's about whether and how the govt.
should/should not involve itself in funding the arts... in general, i think
lbj was on the mark when he passed legislation that said, in effect, yes...
now, clearly there are members of congress who, together, would like to
render a 'no'---and in the absence of a 'no,' will chip away at the 'yes'
bit by bit... which is why i discuss same in terms of politics per se...

anyway, hey, happy trails, folks///

best,

joe

Joe, I think you have hit on it here. In addition to the religious right,
even among the liberal left, there is not a belief that art functions in
this way. My own sense of education at the most 'elite' universities, one
of which I attended, is that, beyond the very few who are actually studying
in studio art programs, the attitude is that art is a kind of high-level
leisure activity, linked more with tennis than with politics. So that even
when it's OK to advocate for the arts, people trained in such institutions
(which would include a good number of high-level government folks in both
major parties), they are advocated more for their importance as
'recreation' than because they "help point the way," as you say.  And of
course, as the famous bumper sticker by Dorn goes:
RECREATION
wrecks the nation

In any case, it's not incomprehensible. The translation is given below of
course. And the substitution is simple - using a name like jennifer to
replace a vowel, with the vowel in the middle like jennEifer to make sure
it's read. I used a simple c program to do the substitutions.

I wanted a text that hides itself, but just so much - as well as a text
that teeters on the edge of noise. I wanted a different sound. I wanted
something that presented an easy way into its hermeneutics, that gave
credence to the letter.

Well good for you - everything in your mind determines the world you evil
solipsist.
And "force" the language into an ""experimental"" form? The language
wasn't
wiling to go? I raped it, maybe? Murdered it?
And fuck how well you know my intentions "for the sake of being that thing
others would call "experimental" -
This just is fucking ugly. You don't know me or my intentions in fact, or
what the "sake" of the writing is.
I have no idea who you are but this is lousy criticism and lousy poetics.


And for your information pieces don't do anything - readers do.

I want to make it clear that I'm not reacting to TB's disliking of my work
- it's the disdain and dismissive attitude. There is A LOT of poetry and
poetics I don't like - but would still give serious reply to on the list
here, recommend, etc., depending on taste. I get tired, awfully tired, of
the harrrummmppptth attitude which grows and grows and grows as language
tangles itself back into tradition. Before I know it I'll be desperate to
go out in the streets and scream I want my baby back or something to that
effect.

        It's not that I had a "nice, clever list of jobs that would be

an "extra-textual" concern, which might also make it off -limits to some

Granary Books announces the publication of
Ted Berrigan: An Annotated Checklist
by Aaron Fischer

"This handsome edition combines Aaron Fischer's literary detective work,
lively commentary by Berrigan's friends and publisers, and a generous
selection of witty collaborative art works by Berrigan and George
Schneeman. I will treasure this book."
-Ron Padgett, poet, translator, and author of Ted: A Personal Memoir


Poet, editor and publisher of the legendary "C" Press Ted Berrigan
(1934-1983) was a charismatic presence on the literary scene of New York's
Lower East Side during the '60s and '70s. "Fiercely unpretentious,
intensely self-absorbed, prodigious in his ambition and energy, Berrigan
did more than create a substantial body of poetry. He also embodied a
spirit that gave meaning to many other writers' lives," wrote Ken Tucker
shortly after Berrigan's death. Through anecdotal descriptions Ted
Berrigan: An Annotated Checklist provides a vivid glimpse of one writer's
life as seen through his publications. Statements and stories from
collaborators and friends such as Ron Padgett and Anne Waldman give this
book an on-the-spot character which separates it from the usual dry
checklist. Lewis Warsh's poignant introduction "Publishing Ted" sets the
stage for a fascinating look into the inner workings of the literary
underground during its heyday. Amply illustrated with 27 never-seen-before
"literary pictures"-collaborations between Berrigan and painter George
Schneeman-this is an important new contribution to the Berrigan canon as
well as a useful tool for understanding one of the richest eras of American
literary history.

I do not believe them.

They are good at acting, and follow direction meticulously. The adults
along with the children.

I then become paranoid about technology transfer to an ideology that has
different uses for it than are in our own best interests, but suit their
long term strategic objectives.

I say, mix them up, and see what happens.

MIME-Version: 1.0

Friday night, July 3, Peter Lamborn Wilson and Lawrence Ferlinghetti read to
a packed house at the Naropa Performing Arts Center. Mats were thrown on the
hardwood floor to accommodate the huge crowd lined up outside the door.
There was barely room to swing a cat. But the air was wild with poetry.

Peter Lamborn Wilson, bemused by having so vast an audience at his disposal,
opened the evening by reading his essay "Praying in Darkness," the latest
installment in the ongoing Lectures in Strange Anthropology series founded
by Peter and others in honor of the late Harry Smith, this latest edition
dedicated to Ferlinghetti.  "Praying" is a fascinating historical exegesis
of the flourishing, debasment and gradual re-emergence of Manchu shamanism.
It begins with an account of an epic poem about Neshan, a proto-feminist
shamaness who undertakes the traditional voyage to the land of the dead and
upon her return rejects all efforts by the priesthood to submit to marriage
and give up her visionary ways. Shamans, noted Peter, are associated with a
nomadic way of life and have the ability to present directly to others the
spirit world. Priests, on the other hand, as agents of agrarian culture who
can only represent the spirit world, have a vested interest in suppressing
shamans. Peter went on to speak of how the cooked masculine culture
continued to absorb and vitiate the raw feminine shamanic tradition under
the Ming and Manchu dynasties until it became little more than empty court
ritual of the sort used to install the puppet emperor Pu Yi as late as 1911.
With the death of Mao, however, it is showing some signs of a comeback in
the remote Northern provinces. A "something that refuses to be defined," a
wildness that resists all attempts to subjugate it, is slowly re-emerging.

Lawrence Ferlinghetti, looking hale, hardy, and dashing in a sky blue shirt
and enormous red glasses, began his portion of the evening by performing two
very funny blues numbers - "Greedy Blues" and "Breeding Blues" - accompanied
ably by Steven Taylor on guitar. The first blues is modelled after the old
song, "Brother, Can You Spare A Dime?" The second one is a Bill
McKibben-like argument for limiting the size of one's personal posterity
("that ersatz eternity," as Camus once noted). Lines like - "O, what is that
sperm filling the void? O, only the humans screwing, dear," brought to mind
some of Alice Notley's more satiric work from Week One.

Blues were followed by several short lyrics recited by memory (by heart)
from _Coney Island_. Then Ferlinghetti took us on a long and delightful ride
through _A Far Rockaway of the Heart_, a long semi-serial work that makes
out  of madness and longing, as the poet himself has it, "a hundred years of
beatitude." These poems range over a wide variety of subject matter, yet are
all keyed in the special idiom Ferlinghetti has made his own, whether he is
speaking of his own life, political tyranny and oppression, Mozart,
painting, Rodin, women, Italy, TS Eliot and WCW, or even poetry itself, a
category of verse he remarked that he was previously against. That idiom is
form of colloquial devotionalism, marked by a tremendous erotic joie de
vivre, and operating in the hinge, the dialectical space where desire
opposes history. It is a poetry of color and vivacity and immediacy, a
celebration of the high and the low, remarkably free from personal
nostalgia, yet full of longing for the foundered heimat of the heart. It's a
poetry of that most difficult of lost arts, affirmation -- of the great
Nietzchean Yes.

Ferlinghetti closed with two uncollected poems - the first an attack on
American hypocrisy and paranoia; the second, "Rivers of Light," (which was
turned into a beautiful broadside by the fabulous printer Julie Seko and her
apprentices in that week's workshop). Written in Prague, where he'd just
been, the poem is an homage to that city and to the ancient journey of the
heart, as it finds itself near journey's end, about to enter "into the
tongue of light."

I was referring to all those "I want my baby back" television movies that
are based on the idea of the nuclear family as inviolate except for those
forces of evil that take children away from mothers, who are there to be
there (no other reason) for children (as children).

You are the first to ever make an offer of that kind. I thankyou for that.
I have read in London twice, at the local public library both times. Both
times with other poets.

Right this moment, I cannot take you up on it. At least not immediately,
because of a current job search, possible forced geographic relocation due
to joblessness, and not knowing the schedule that will be imposed by those
kinds of commitments. To put it succinctly, I am not free to commit to
anything out of town, into the future, as job interviews and work schedule
necessarily take survival precedence and cause that to change at a moment's
notice.

If that situation improves, and I am geographically within range of London
I will certainly take you up on your offer.

>i have no time for whiny fudges that won't get off their asses.i  offer

I have gotten up off my ass so many times, I have lost count. I have also
been knocked down onto it quite a few times, in different situations. So
I am the wrong person to direct that comment toward.

>if you can provide the transport i can provide the gig. give me two weeks.

I am sure someone else could use me, as transportation to London. There is
always someone looking for a lift to a gig.

>i will get on my ego and slide.

I have never done it for ego's sake, or based on ego.
I suppose we have different natures in that regard.

        Since the beginning of this exchange I've had a strong feeling that
Todd Baron read only the first section of the work--not noticing the rest.
There was nothing obscure in the second section, the "translation" Alan
called it, or the base text that was translated by his program. I'm one who
enjoys & learns from Alan's work, though like a lot of his list-readers I
don't respond in writing each time.

odd--that my response to a piece of writing  should be met with anything
other than a continuation of a discussion. Poetics--not poetry--is
simply a discussuion--and that I read the entire piece--didn't like its
project--but felt the need to respond--IS a poetics attempting to engage
a discussion. Briefly--I did not like the "poem" or piece--found both
sections dis-engaged--one not really meant to be "read" and the other a
straight forward narrative that did not engage me.  Oddly enough--for
those responses--I've been labeled a "revisionist" and such-- I wonder
why.

anyway--

Peter, by the same token, if every criticism is labeled dismissive, rude,
uncalled-for, etc., maybe people will be afraid to criticize.  As I see it
Meikal's post was a criticism of Alan's 4-letter over-reaction.  Maybe we
all need to tone down the scold level and try to take everything in
good humor.  After all, that's one of the advantages of these lists;
everybody has time to reconsider the slugfest before or afterhand.
If Alan's entitled to post his creations, which of course he is, then
Todd's entitled to express his opinions.

"dismissive"--no. A reaction entirely does the opposite--had I wanted to
"dismiss" the work--I would have delted it it silently. Have you noticed
that there has actually been more dialogue about this particular issue
and piece of writing than usual. Mainly, this list talks about "payment"
and issue of magazines--and very little do I see a posting regarding a
"poetics": a dialogue: a discussion on such.  The work is "challenging"?
OK--then I challenged it! Would this--had it been read in a group
situation--been simply read and not responded to? If a poem or poet or
artist or artwork cannot stand the critical response (which, by the
way--mine was--if you noticed I discussed the two sections of the
piece--seemingly know the piece almost by heart now--and discussed the
concept of "experimental"--which everything is--unless you think you've
"got it"--and have written several postings on the poem. I have never
attacked the poet--as the poem was all I was concerned with. If you
think that by responding in a truth and critical way stops people from
posting work--challenging or otherwise--then maybe they shold stop
posting work. After all, is it to be "read"? which is an active
thing--or "read" like/as in, listened to--like TV--then walked away
from?

The idea--for me-of this list --is such a dialogue--less for posting
poems than for discussing issues of poetics. That is certainly not a
failure--as we seem to be trying to do so now...

I would think (odd verb tense there) that when somebody says that they've
never heard of Dr. Angelou being taking to task for . . . . a relevant
question might well be "where has this not hearing taken place?"  True
enough, you won't find such criticism in the pages of ESSENCE,, but Dr.
Angelou has had the benefit of any number of negative responses through the
years --

Subject:      challenging works

Speaking of reading and criticizing: here's an abstract question if anybody's
interested:  should a poem have a "rational" essence or essences?  In other
words, is it possible to theorize about an overall ethos (or purpose, or
impulse) behind a work?

This kind of idea is threatening on various levels: example, "your theories
get in the way of my reading the poem itself", or, "the poem is the poem,
it's an experience, not an exercise in allegorical meaning".

But sometimes like in other realms of experience we tend toward fetishism
or fascination with externals.  Do we read, hear, understand whole poems
anymore?  Is that something we can ask of a poet?  Like, for example,
you go to the latest violent thriller movie in all the theaters, and you
ask, underneath the extravaganza, what is this film doing?  Basically
glorifying male arrogance and indulging violent appetites.

Here's a poem which assumes that not only a particular poem but a poet's
lifework can be summarized, abstracted, reduced, in a certain way.
Admittedly this is only ONE way to look at that particular poet - but
it's the ACT of summarizing that intrigues me:

The state shame of the Egyptians
was adorned with pedigree dogs -
the dead were endowed with all sorts of things
and the pyramid stuck up - a mere trifle.

He lived mischievously alongside the gothic,
and spat on the spider's rights,
the insolent schoolboy and robber angel,
the incomparable Francois Villon.

- Mandelstam, 1937

I feel a little cheated if I come away from reading a poem with no concept
of what it MEANS - with no sense of an overall cognitive momentum, you might
say, with no moral force.  There IS an allegorical level to language - to
deny it is to lose the whole parabolic force of writing.  Then again,
just as often the reader (me) will cheat the author - not give it the reading
it deserves.

specific audience.  I think his texts are one of the best examples we
have of electro writing taking on presence & entity consciousness in the
cyberstream. further, Ive been endlessly bemused by how provocative
these texts become to the poetic thought stream, the comparison I think
of is turning on kids who have only been exposed to the 20th century
canon to language writing.

as for those who misunderstood "fuck clarification" (the title should
have been giveaway), I was referencing the work of Malok, a vetern mail
artist famous for his series of ecstatic prayers to humanity called FUCK
DIRGE 1-7,      in which that horrible word is evoked as a transcendent
chant. (of which Malok was inspired by Bern Porter's Last Acts of St
Fuck You). my feeling was also layered with frustration that of all
places Alan has to take time to validate his work, whether because of it
exoticisms, encryption, text wrangling or whatnot.

hopefully Ive blurred the ground between intentions & the random
multiplicity of interpretations even further.

Depends what you want Erols is inexpensive, and there are inexpensive ones
listed in the Voice, etc. There's Interport.net and Panix.com which I use
- the last is $32.50 a month but includes both IP and shell accounts.
Finally there's good old AOL. Panix and Interport - as most ISPs - are
flat rate so I'm not sure what you mean by "most e-mail."

I use Mindspring from NYC, & have excellent results...

$20/month for unlimited connection time

have rarely if ever had a busy signal

only problem is no telnet reader for email, in other words you always
have to "pop" your email from a server

but if you have a university account, you can use mindspring for IP
access and then telnet to your mail account (voila)

you might check out Megs Inet.  i don't know how good they are, but
they're nationwide and cheap.  www.megsinet.com 888-233-1144

their webpage says $10 unlimited for K56, $15 for 2X56, $20 for ISDN
dialup.

great query--the old one--and persoanlly--I don't always need to come
away from a poem with a "read" meaning.  If you read Celan, say,
today--what is the meaning of many of the poems?  Forget allegory--or
the old weak metaphor--but isn't language a creative thing--that
generates--and engenders--as well as (can be used for) saying something.
I want my grocery list to have immediate readability--but I spend very
little time investing the language there!

In one sense, there should be no ruling idea of how
to "deal" with poetry; when you first bring someone
to a poem, when it's their first time really "reading"
poetry, it's vital to guide them towards an idea that
the poem is "saying something". Otherwise, you risk
a sort of unthoughtout response along the lines of
"ah, isn't poetry great, it all sounds so poetic."

But I think some people begin to get obsessed with
finding a poem's essence. That idea, that there is
a "soul" to a poem hidden beneath its syntax and
word choice, is in some sense derived from the Romantic
poem itself, with all its faith in self-expression,
in the soulful [I/eye]. We read a poem and perceive
the text itself as the author, struggling to find itself.
The critic's job then, is to "psychoanalyse" the poem
and figure it all out.

When you get to issues of indeterminacy, multiple narratives,
the "postmodern condition", and so on, all this soulsearching
becomes second order. You can point to indeterminacy and
say, ya, there it is; but that's not the poem's "point".
The poem begins with indeterminacy, and moves from there
along some vector oblique to the critic's tongue.

Here's something I've been playing with today; I took an
old draft of a poem and started removing words,
rearranging the typography, pushing in spaces and generally
trying to condense and eliminate. The two texts are
below, side by side. The right hand side "includes"
the meaning of the left, and vice versa, although you
might not have found the right in the left. What is the
essence of the left hand side? Is it different from the
right? And what is the sum of the two -- does it mean
something different?

Not sure the formatting is going to work, so I've put
up the two texts at
http://www.fas.harvard.edu/~sdedeo/sonnet.html

What I'm trying to get at here is that the idea that a
poem has an "essence" is not as simple as it seems at first
glance. It complexifies; sort of like those endless theological
debates that the Pharisees pose Jesus about the immortal
soul (if a man marries again after his wife dies, who is
he married to in heaven?), or the medieval theologians
go on about.

Megsinet is the bomb. They are pretty much a midwest company tho and
unfortunately don't have local dial up in NYC, unless something has
changed in the last two months. I can get you set up, with ISP and
pages, earthlink with sprint/mci backbone, let me know.

Be well

definite nature, within firmly established laws, imposed upon them. Man
is supposed to determine his nature himself on the basis of his freedom;
which now means to see the world as serving his self-definition. Even
before Copernicus, the shift of the accent from cosmology to
anthropology, a process on which the Middle Ages as a whole had
worked--under the terms set by prior assumptions--in tiny steps, and
with setbacks, is pushed so far forward that the loss of the real center
of the universe, as a consequence of a relation to the world that could
no longer be characterized cosmologically, could be accepted."---from
The Genesis of the Copernican World by Hans Blumenberg
---
"The time of an event is defined as the reading of a clock coincident
with the event and at rest relative to it. Events which are simultaneous
in one inertial frame are not simultaneous in another. Einstein's
example: two identical rods R(1) and R(2) are coincident in a given
inertial frame in which two observers O(1) and O(2) have synchronized
their respective clocks...."--from 'Subtle is the Lord; The Science and
the Life of Albert Einstein by Abraham Pais

"The concept of observation is in so far arbitrary as it depends upon
which objects are included in the system of observation."---Neils Bohr

Bettors on Net ask: If people die anyway, why not make sport of it?

By John Powers, Globe Staff, 07/08/98=20

OK, the very idea - gambling on famous people dying - seems sick. The
players themselves admit it. Macabre, morbid, all that. And yet, death
comes to us all. So why not get a bet down on who=92ll go 10 toes up?=20

=91=91We certainly don=92t wish for anybody to die,=92=92 says Jake Maruby,=
 who runs
Dying for Dollars, a popular =91=91death pool=92=92 on the Internet. =91=91B=
ut nothing we
do is going to change things.=92=92

The Grim Reaper harvests on his own schedule, but who says you can=92t
indulge in a bit of spectral speculation? If you were one of the shrewd
bettors who figured that Chris Farley or Princess Di might be on the 1997
list, you hit the jackpot.=20

If you had Roy Rogers or Wendy O. Williams or Tammy Wynette or Sonny
Bono this year, you chalked up big points. Frank Sinatra? Dr. Spock? Who
didn=92t have them? And everybody always has the Pope. He=92s what they call
a perennial.=20

Death pools have been around since at least the 19th century. =91=91It=92s a=
 game, a
very amusing game that they play in every drawing room in Paris whenever
an `Immortal=92 passes on,=92=92 Georges Duroy says to Madame Walter in Guy
de Maupassant=92s novel =91=91Bel Ami.=92=92=20

The game of Death has gone cyber now, and it includes anyone who might
ever have rated a page in People or 30 seconds on =91=91Entertainment=
 Tonight.=92=92
At least a dozen death pools with names like Celebrity Death Pool, A Date
With Charon Dead Pool, Derby Dead Pool, and Dead! are now on the
Internet, abetted by master lists like the Dead People Server and You=92re
Outta Here! that keep track of who=92s still living and who has joined the=
 choir
invisible. (James Mason: dead; Jackie Mason: alive.)=20

While pools differ on format, most involve submitting a list of up to 50
people =91=91marked for death=92=92 in the coming calendar year. The more=
 prescient
the pick (like rapper Tupac Shakur in 1996), the more the points.=20

Some pools come with modest cash payoffs; others merely provide bragging
rights and 15 minutes of cyberfame. =91=91Of course we=92re not rooting for=
 these
people to die,=92=92 Ron Frey says on his site, The Death Pool. =91=91We=
 just want
the points.=92=92

Morbid or not, death pools are undeniably intriguing. =91=91People will tell=
 me
`That=92s sick,=92=92=92 says Ray Markey, a New Jersey computer networker=
 who
runs the Philadelphia Dead Pool. =91=91Then they say, `Well, can I see the=
 list?=92
Then they say, `You know who you don=92t have?=92 Then they say, `How do I
get in?=92=92=92

=91=91Ghoulpooling=92=92 is, Maruby concedes, a guilty pleasure. Still,=
 betting against
the living is as American as the Constitution. Why else did the Founding
Fathers dream up the idea of a vice president, who is frequently described
as being =91=91a heartbeat away=92=92 from the Oval Office? Why else would=
 we have
life insurance?=20

=91=91People take out policies against death and dismemberment,=92=92 says=
 Melody
Rutherford, a San Francisco computer worker who=92s been involved with the
Celebrity Death Pool since the early =9170s. =91=91You=92re betting that=
 you=92re going
to die before you pay up. And the company is betting that you won=92t.=92=92

Besides, it=92s not as if the players are bumping people off to move=
 themselves
up in the standings. That was the plot of =91=91The Dead Pool,=92=92 the=
 1988 Dirty
Harry movie in which death pool celebrities were mysteriously turning up
dead. =91=91We frown on that,=92=92 says Rutherford. =91=91You wouldn=92t=
 get any points if
you killed somebody. You=92d be disqualified.=92=92

Death pools may be macabre, but they do have rules. Decedents must be
notable (or notorious) enough to have their passing mentioned on television
or in a major newsmagazine. They must be certifiably dead (not just
presumed) and must have been human (no cartoon characters or animals).=20

There are also rules that govern betting on (OK, against) the living. Nobody
on death row. Nobody whose government has put a price on his head
 (though author Salman Rushdie is fair game, since he=92s on a religious=
 sect=92s
hit list). And nobody who=92s just received a artificial major organ. =91=91=
No
baboon hearts,=92=92 says Maruby, who lives outside of New York City and
works for a publishing company.=20

Other than that, anyone from Madonna to the Queen Mum is fair game.
Actuarial strategies abound. Most ghoulpoolers choose =91=91the old, the=
 feeble,
the overweight, the addicted.=92=92 Others =91=91chase ambulances,=92=92=
 picking
celebrities who=92ve had strokes (Gene Kelly), developed cancer (Frank
Zappa), or contracted AIDS (Randy Shilts).=20

Others do =91=91lifestyle analyses=92=92 and select healthy people with=
 unhealthy
tendencies (=91=91the young and the restless=92=92), like rock stars who=
 snort coke and
drive Porsches at 120 miles per hour. Still others pick totalitarian=
 dictators
with bloody hands (the =91=91live by the sword, die by the sword=92=92=
 theory) or
violent types due for =91=91karmic payback.=92=92

You don=92t have to be Vincent Price to play this most extreme (and endless)
game. Organizers say that most ghoulpoolers are between 20 and 40 and
that as many women play as men. =91=91They=92re the people next door,=92=92=
 says
Maruby, who has more than 80 players in his Dying for Dollars pool, which
costs $25 a year (=91=91just pennies a day=92=92) to enter. =91=91They just=
 have a different
slant on things.=92=92

Ghoulpoolers pore through newspapers and magazines and watch =91=91ET=92=92=
 for
hints that someone famous might be heading for a =91=91dirt nap.=92=92=
 Street rioting in
a Third World country whose ruler has been propped up by the CIA since
the =9170s. A punk rocker who=92s off to Hazelden for his third detox. An
actress who=92s back on chemo. An ex-ballplayer who=92s too frail to make it=
 to
his Hall of Fame enshrinement.=20

They check the Noted Nonagenarians and Centenarians Web site for
anyone on borrowed time. They consult the Dead People Server to make
sure it was James Earl Ray and not James Earl Jones who crossed the Styx.
And they=92re scrupulous about keeping up with the obits. =91=91First thing=
 every
day, they log onto the CNN Web page and search for the word `dead,=92=92=92
says Ray Markey, who has 153 members in his Philadelphia Dead Pool and
250 who want in for next year.=20

One popular ghoulpool choice who has stayed in play so far is Milton Berle,
who, at 89, is Great-Great-Granduncle Miltie by now; most participants
have chips on his number. They=92re also betting against Muhammad Ali, Fidel
Castro, Kirk Douglas, Robert Downey Jr., the Rev. Billy Graham,
Katharine Hepburn, Bob Hope, Saddam Hussein, Richard Pryor, Ronald
Reagan, Elizabeth Taylor, Strom Thurmond, and Boris Yeltsin.=20

Betting on =91=91perennials=92=92 like Hope and Reagan, though, is like=
 betting on
favorites at the race track. It=92s brainless and, usually, fruitless.=20

Stephen Hawking, the author-physicist with Lou Gehrig=92s disease, has
already lived more than three times longer than medical tables say he should
have. =91=91Keith Richards,=92=92 Maruby says. =91=91People have been losing=
 money on
him for years.=92=92

=91=91Teasers=92=92 who keep eluding their demise (remember the endless=
 =91=91Franco
takes turn for worse=92=92 headlines?) drive ghoulpoolers crazy. So=
 connoisseurs
would rather score big with an exotic bet on someone like Pol Pot, whom
most folks had forgotten was still alive until he died April 15.=20

Les Aspin, Herve Villechaize, and Lee Atwater all carried heavy points
when they booked passage with Charon. This year=92s long shots include
James Brown, Bob Dylan, Hugh Hefner, Jerry Lewis, and Frank Perdue,
according to several Web sites.=20

Granted, betting humans as if they=92re Preakness entrants can require some
soul-searching. =91=91Am I ready to put aside that puritanical side of me=
 that says
this is disrespectful of the living, not to mention exploitive of the
dead?=92=92 Ron
Frey muses on The Death Pool.=20

The idea of =91=91harvesting stiffs=92=92 may be macabre, but graveyard=
 humor goes
back at least as far as Lazarus. Shakespeare has dying Mercutio cracking
wise (=91=91Ask for me tomorrow and you will find me a grave man.=92=92) and
Hamlet holding poor Yorick=92s skull as though it were a cantaloupe. So
what=92s wrong with a decedents derby?=20

=91=91People say, `Oh my God, that=92s terrible,=92=92=92 says Melody=
 Rutherford. =91=91Then
they say: `Bob Hope.=92=92=92

This is probably a pretty obvious response, but are there pools based
on who will make it THROUGH a year?  Could I bet, for example, that
Ronald Reagan will make it to 1999, or that Queen Elizabeth will.  A
list of a hundred people over seventy, or with lethal diseases like
Hawking's that you bet will live could be fun.

     Sorry to have misunderstood your Fuck Clarification post. I think you
     can see how it was possible to take it the wrong way. All I'm looking
     for here(for Alan and everyone else) is a little respect and civility
     in the way people respond to Listee's work. I think that Todd Baron's
     original post was slighting no matter how much damage control he does.
     His statement about how his post was not dismissive, as dismissive to
     him means not saying anything, is just silly. I think that on a List
     devoted to innovative work, calling a dense, encrypted poem
     "superfluous" and asking sarcastically if "space" can be wasted is
     mean-spirited. If he had reasons for disliking the work, they should
     have appeared in his original post. And Henry Gould's concerns, which
     amounted in my opinion to "if you can't stand the heat..." were off
     the mark. I'm sure that Alan welcomes genuine criticism, favorable or
     not, and that's why he posts his work here. If there are people on the
     List who strongly object to "innovations, renovations, and
     investigations of form and/or/as content, to the questioning of
     received forms and styles, and to the creation of the otherwise
     unimagined, untried, unexpected, improbable, and impossible," I wish
     they'd go somewhere else.

One more salvo.  Looking for a logical form or meaningful unity in a poem
doesn't have to be caricatured as pedantic exercise; it doesn't have to be
equated with digging for hidden meanings, allegories. Meaning isn't
something your dry scholar "consumes".

Consumption sounds too passive for the exercise of understanding involved.
Nor does the fact that a poem might have a meaning-form mean it has
become some kind of fast-food for dry intellects and lost its inherent
poetry.  Pound talked about logopeia - the "play" of the logic or meaning
of poetry as one of its 3 main aspects (along with visual and sound values).
So the meaning of a poem isn't some kind of workmanlike signpost for
use-value, "what it really means", etc.  In a poem the meanings are part
of the overall structure set in motion, set in play.  This independent
play aspect is poetry's manner of being in the world - it's analogous
to the free soul's awareness of mortality and consequent liberation
from strictly material or selfish or momentary values.  Poetry lives in
this free atmosphere or "eternal life" - this is the meaning at the core
of its meanings.

Okay, Peter, you've quoted the List Guidelines twice now, you've scolded
Todd a couple of times for what he said, you've told me I was off the mark,
although I beat you to the "let's be civil" position by a day or so on
this one -
did it ever occur to you that you might meet Todd Baron halfway and try
to engage specifically what he finds faulty with the work in question and
defend the work if necessary - rather than continuing to suggest that
he (Todd) has no right to feel that way on this list and he should shove off?
What is "civil" in your mind?

This is community work?

The one who phrased those list guidelines just might disagree with your last
remarks there. The opposition (though one would hope thoughtful and empathetic)
also serves a useful purpose in making us become strong and healthy innovators.

Certainly if dismissive means not saying anything then we're almost all of us
guilty of being dismissive, even if not intentionally so, given the nature of
this electronic forum that we share. It is reasonable to assume that work one
has invested so much in should be received with respect if not just silence
(indifference?). Not all remarks constitute "criticism" either, but may
certainly constitute opposition (and very likely an assertion of one's tastes).
Yet one always has the opportunity for counter-criticism, or counterattacks,
which some here exercise to the utmost. But the reception of criticism or
comment here has always been a matter of who (as in "some may, but others
cannot").

These affairs have all the flavor of a political or popularity contest, which
result in the unmasking of affiliations, preferences, and comments that sound
as if they are simply saying "remember me for good when I come into your
kingdom." The rest is just community work.

Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII

        I find it very strange that this anthology Poems for the Millenium
has not one poem by T.S. Eliot. I can sort of understand not wanting to
publish the Wasteland . I say sort of. But I don't really  agree, but I
understand sort of. But not one poem in either volume by Eliot, now isn't
that pushing a point too far - not that I am sure what the point is. Is
this an oversight on the part of the editors, is it an attempt to deny
Eliot his rightful place as a great poet while at the same time vaguely
(there are a few words which state that Eliot's work did play a seminal
role... etc... ) acknowledging his greatness? Eliot's poetics, voice, and
stylistic ideas have influenced [and will continue to influence] poets in
all cultures. Why do the editors Jerome Rothenberg and Pierre Joris
support this absence? Yet they publish poems by Pound. I can't figure it
out. Pound was an outright fascist at one point  yet he gets published in
anthology which claims to be a voice of the avant-garde, of the margins,
of the ethno-poetics of the native cultures around the world, yet Eliot
does not get printed. Strange editorial policy. Is this a sort of reverse
sovietism in poetics? Of course I am being polemical, and this
establisment of the so-called avant-garde as the true voice of a
revolutionary
poetics strikes me as a type of poetic resentiment.

To my mind, PFTM doesn't *attempt* to be a comprehensive collection of
*all* the "great literature" extant--one wd. need the proverbial red
wheelbarrow to carry such. Rather, it presents galleries, and has brought
to my attention many incisive, surreal, and just plain jiggy-with-it
poetries I hadn't been able to find anywhere else. Eliot is pretty firmly
enstellated, & I don't see how any attempt to "deny his greatness" (even
if such had been their intent, which it isn't) could remotely succeed. I
will be returning to both volumes of PTFM a lot for inspiration,
historical perspective, good reading--and to my mind J&R deserve worship
for simply making an anthology that doesn't have those goddamn headnotes.

"At this point, a confusion between the aspects of probability and
rationality is easy. For the incorporation of some empirical
generalization into a theory, thus linking it with all the other laws
forming part of such a theory, has always been believed to add more
inductive strength to an hypothesis, or to increase its inductive
probability, notwithstanding the possibility of subsequent overthrow of
the hypothesis in question. But the logic of such a 'consilience of
inductions' (as it is often called) is still quite unsettled. And in any
case, we have already shown that although Kant's position may have
gained plausibility from this conception, it was primarily concerned,
not with the question of the strength of inductive generalization
regarded as a law, but rather with the question of what made such a
genralization into a law, treated as a problem of logic and semantics
rather than the pragmatics of induction."---from Metaphysics and the

Golly, I think _every_ anthology ought to have TSE--I mean, after all,
it's so hard to find an anthology of 20th-c. poetry that has Eliot in
it...
CD, I'm going to be generous and assume you're being disingenuous here (in
some tangled way).  Joris & Rothenberg's flawed (and what anthology
isn't?) but really very important volumes are all about promoting an
_alternative_
version of what modernism and postm. were/are about, one that goes against
the grain of what the academy and the New Yorker and other venues assume
to be literary history.  Eliot is as deeply embedded in that institutional
version of poetic history as Longfellow was in 1898.
Why Pound?--because, despite his fascism and anti-Semitism, Pound was an
incredibly fertile source of poetic suggestions, methods, and instigations
throughout the first 3/4 (at least) of the century, not least to
counter-cultural poets of the '60s who rejected his politics whole cloth.
(And why can't one be a fascist & anti-Semite and yet still occupy those
coveted "margins"?)
"Deny Eliot his status as a great poet"--please.  For every Rothenberg and
Joris who decide that the space taken up by Eliot's overanthologized and
universally available work would be better given to someone else who isn't
being simultaneously taught in 4000 college classrooms, there are hordes
of academics, talking heads, and arbiters of taste who still kowtow to him
as much as they did back in the 1950s.  Unfortunately, Eliot doesn't have
anything to worry about--yet.

This is exactly right. I don't remember if this came up on the list, but I
know from Jerry that Eliot's estate wanted an outrageous amount of money.
Which is why, on p. 382 of volumne I, where "The Wasteland" should be, it
says "Much anthologized, Eliot's poem is easily available in _The Complete
Poems and Plays_ & in many representative anthologies of American
modernism." After which the commentary underlines its importance, contra
the opinion of WCW.

This is sad but true. I wanted to quote a couple lines in my recent history
book, from a novel by D.H. Lawrence, and the estate wanted to soak me good,
the keepers of the estate being, I think, the relatives of the guy that
DHL's significant other was fooling with while he was dying on the
Continent. So I didnt use the quotation, even though I had taken it without
asking and quoted it in an earlier book.

        I like that a bad word play that yields the Possum's name. Ha.
        Well.

        So as for the poetry of TS ELIOT.

        I quote Pound:


        For three years out of key with his time
        He strove to resusciate the dead art

        Of poetry....
        Eliot Succeeded in resusciating the 'dead art'...
                And as for Eliot not creating 'experimental threads'
        well even Kenneth Rexroth did not deny that....

        There are at least 5 references in Pound's Cantos

        where he refers to the Possum as being a better poet....

        so that shld. lay to rest all this falderall about

        Pound being innovative and Eliot not being innovative....

Subject: gallery...trope....

                this whole trope which the editors use... galleries ....
it  does not work... poems are not paintings... this is a Form of Reverse
        and Open Repression of a great Poet. Because of what?

        because of the Incredible influence of both his Poetics, His

        politics, and the critical schools which came into existence

        in the name of a few ideas which Eliot bounced around....

        it is like that silly comment of Williams...

        about the Wasteland setting back literature so many years...

        that was William's Take. Not Hart Cranes. Not Joyce's


        They include Joyce and try thereby to Appropriate Joyce into their

        Notion of the Avant-Garde. Joyce abhorred the avant-garde.

        Joyce thought Eliot was a great poet when he read the
Wasteland....

        this is nonsense and Censorship of the First Order


        It is very American as well....


        A gallery with out T.S. Eliot?/ Come now this is lopsided
evangelical avant-gardism.

        It is like having a great International Show of  Painting

        and I am walking through the Gallery and the Note

        says Sorry Eliot is TOo Big. But we Published His Pal

        Pound . Hahah This is too facile.

        I have been reading Rothenberg's anthologies [and I own them
copies of great anthologies by him]
        for a few years now.

        Great , marvelous. I like Rothenberg's poems.  From time to time.

        ad its great that he printed that countess... very nice...
but./...

        Ted Hughes and Seamus Heaney have done similar anthologies

        and neither of them would dream of doing Eliot the

        absentee number. It strikes me as ResentIment. I use the

        french spelling of the word as used by Nietzsche.

        I think they made a  big mistake.

        Very big critical Error. It surprises that the critics who were

        evidently consulted while this anthology was being prepared

        did not speak up on behalf of the poetry of Eliot.

        I say ONE Poem in their Gallery would have Done the Trick.

        Say the Hollow Men, or Preludes.

        I think it is really bad.

        That sort of thing by the way would Never happen in Canada.

        I think this is an example of an American school of

        Poetics i.e. the 'other tradition' as seen and gathered

        by Rothenberg, and that because this anthology Deliberately
        Leaves Out TS  Eliot it Fails.
        It fails because it censors by Absence

        it fails because it is smug in its own assumptions.

        Those assumptions are the ones based on a rhetoric

        which has no relevance to the larger world of contemporary

        writing now....


        In fact this anthology is over-rated.

        Most of these poems are available to anyone who seeks them out.

        And besides it is TOO LARge to Carry around.

        Okay I am being over the top. But let it be said that

        if Poetry is going to be read or heard

        it Must be Portable.

        Thank god for Lawrence Ferlinghetti.

Subject: Censorship of Eliot's poetry



        A real example of censorship is this anthology published in 1995.
 Poems for the Millenium edited by Jerome Rothenberg and Pierre
Joris. There are 2 Volumes. They gather all sorts of poetry from all
around the world much of it translated of course.

        Amazingly there is not ONE POEM by ELIOT/
        Pound there is. And plenty of others.
        They are the real censors of Eliot's poetry.
        Censorship by Absence. I think it is the poetics of resentment
        Of envy, and a complete loss of critical detachment.
        Another boring book which hails itself in the name of the
Millenium  No less!

        No Poetry By Eliot. It staggered this reader.
        all done in the name of the avant-garde.

        Poems for the Millenium Vol 1 &2.

        Yes, this anthology will be remembered.

        A pathetic fallacy of the worst sort.

        And Eliot's poetry is going to be around for a Long Long Time

        Maybe ever Forever.

        an anxiety of resentment

        .

One last word from me about the anthology.

Of course there are things left out, for all sorts of reasons, that I, for
one, think should be there. But there are also a great many poets gathered
with whose work I was not familiar before. So, while there may be an
occasional lapse in the presentation of whatever canon, there is also a
large extension of the canon.

But that speaks to the anthology as a collection of greatest hits. I read
it rather as a defining of the field as experienced by the editors, and
what they present is consistent and complex, each of the century's moments
seen larger, I think, than they've been seen before, and each of the poets
contextualized within that large frame. Not a bad accomplishment.

Here is a guy who wants to use words like "resentiment" but apparently
does not know that Eliot wrote a poem called "The Waste Land," not (as
Mr. Duff has it in three separate posts) "the Wasteland."  He also does
not know how to spell millennium.

I thought the strategy in volume I -- here's where we'd put the
Waste Land, if we had the money, but we don't, and anyway it's all over
the damn place, insert your copy here -- was brilliant and hilarious.
Managed to include Eliot in any meaningful sense of the term, which does
not, in Eliot's case, mean "make available" (what poet is more so?).

David

An interesting question, but one that seems to miss some points. One of

counts, more than what's missing. But I would hazard that the one poem of
Eliot's they would have wanted was 'The Wasteland," & that's the one that
is most difficyult & expensive to get. I liked the way they handled that
problem: remarking on its importance & sending readers to it (those few who
didn't already know it almost by heart). Most of the readers who pick up
the anthologies will already 'know' Eliot, & especially 'The Wasteland';
many, like me, won't know all the connections to other poetries Joris &
Ropthenberg provide. That is one of the superb values of the anthologies, &
I'm grateful for them...

About once a year someone flies onto the list, says it's crazy to read
Pound, you all must be evilly out of your minds, where's x, where's y,
gets heaped upon by the list, disappears.

I say fleadh. What about Olson, isn't it evilly out of the mind of our
times to read this Folsom Cave to now nut? Or Duncan, meadowhead.
Perverse! Or Koch or Schuyler, what do they mean by that tone, those
tones? Don't even think of discussing an author born after 1934. Better to
put all the old boys away and only read the poetry of young women. Modern
poetry begins with Dickinson and ends with Marianne Moore. Postmodern
poetry begins with Niedecker and ends with Harryette Mullen. The poetry of
young women begins with ...

and then what if the discussion were something other than non-overlapping
lists? Imagine a pressure on the subscribers of this list to include a) an
original observation on something written in a poem b) a syllogism drawing
on two other listmembers' observations c) something political yet
non-complicit with the texts of evil (I'm not sure I know what that means
but since this is a language-poetry zone I thought I would gesture?) d)
blah blah parody blah blah parody e) something anything! besides lists, or
hobbyhorses...

or is American poetry really completely empty of thought. At least some
poets try not to help you fall asleep...must...stay...awake...

You're absolutely on the fleadh there Jordan.  You do Carnival, I'll do Lent.
And then again: what about Eric Blarnes?  Why is he always left out?  Of
both millennia - I mean, ALL THREE??  Come on!  The poet may wear tweed,
smoke a pipe & his underwear inside out, but is that any reason?
As Robert Duncan wrote somewhere at least twice, and I quote:
Anthologize!  Anthologize your mother!
- Jack Spandrift or somebody

p.s. Eliot actually called Eric last week from the Purgatory Men's Room to
complain about not being in enough anthologies - Blarnes said he'd talk
to Sylvia about it and give Jack Kerouac's left second-removed uncle Spam
a call too just in case there's a case there.  Anthologize your cousin Vinnie!
hey, and remember: it's Waste  Land, The  with TWO spaces between!

I'm going to be a bit sarcastic here CD, so please don't be offended,  BUT

You need to be careful.  You kind of goofed here in some way. There's a translation by T.S. Eliot in the first volume of a St.-John Perse poem. Is this to be ignored if you feel you must stand by your statement "not one poem by T.S. Eliot?"

Think of it this way. When you first move into a new house in a  new neigborhood , how do you get to know the neighbors? Do you first go and  ACTUALLY MEET THEM? What kind of effort are you making? Or do you talk to the IN crowd first, the Cool neighbors,  to get the scoop?Hey dude, Like what's up with the guy and his family across the street? Is he like from Persia or something? Fill me in. He and his family keep to himself.  I said hello and he like turns his back on me. And his kids keep running through my yardl And his two daughters. What's up with them? They COULDN'T have come from the same Womb. No way.

 Have you already formed opinions soon after moving in,  based on the first person who talks with any kind of  authority, followed  up with  GOSSIP and  Hearsay? Or do you only  talk to those who welcome  you to the neighborhood with a fresh-baked WELCOME pie? Is it like,  I mean THEY need to make the effort. I'm new here afterall. And hey if you change your mind I prefer brownies or choclate chip cookies.

****

You've mentioned the T.S. Eliot 'commentary ' on page 382 of Volume One of _  Poems For The Millennium_.. Now, turn TO THE VERY NEXT PAGE. There you go. That's it. That wasn't so bad was it ?
Page 383 is a selection "from ANABASIS" (St.-John Perse). Translated from the French by T.S. ELIOT ! Yes right next door. Who could have known. I mean its in such small print. The acknowlegement, that is.

 Still though, the very NEXT PAGE? CD?

Hello?McFly? Anybody home? Just came to say hello, and I brought you some brownies, as you so desire, but, well ok you like them,great, except the recipe has been in my family for YEARS.And we kind of made an unspoken family PACT to not give the recipe away, or use it for monetary gain. Sorry can't give you the recipe, but I'll be sure to make some for you from time to time. Don't be a stranger. Welcome.
****

 Is this not a poem by T.S. Eliot? For heaven's sake the first poem after the editor's (as you describe it) dismissive commentary on  T.S. Eliot,  IS a  translation by T.S. Eliot. (Ok.  So I made my point!)

 Doesn't that count? Or is this ONLY a poem by St.-John Perse?

Isn't this like saying you didn't know that the person who lived RIGHT NEXT DOOR TO YOU ALL OF THESE YEARS was your blood relative?  If I only knew!,you might protest. I would have at least made more of an effort. Surely! I know myself  better than that.  All this time wasted. Who'd of thought such a thing. I mean That guy was SO stand offish. My relatives aren't like that, well for the most part. And he looks Mediterranean. How could I know. I mean did my MOM give a baby up for adoption and not tell anyone?

Besides.

 All the neighbors agreed. He likes to stir up trouble in the neighborhood just for the sake of causing trouble. Everybody knows THAT. Who could have known he was related to me, however distantly?. I must admit I'm offended by that mailbox he's using. It's sunk into a Bathtub! Does he think this cornball stuff is avant-garde or something? Couldn't he have at least used a bathtub without rust stains on it?I mean come on. I guess I should be grateful he didn't plant flowers in a toilet. And yes, Ok he does trim his bushes frequently. There is a sense of decorum at times.

BUT NOW LOOK!   that sign in his yard, he's voting for Leonard Steiner. We don't need to vote someone like that again, if you know what I mean, on  to the State Planning Commision. I don't know. I just sensed something was wrong from the beginning. Department of Plants and Structures maybe, but surely not a STATE commission job. PL-EE-ase.


And those kids of his.Did I mention that already? AHHYYY! So loud. Always cutting through my yard. Couldn't they use the sidewalk? Granted his wife has hands like butter, but I was NEW in town, I didn't know anybody, THEY should have made the effort.

****


To give you the benefit of the doubt,CD, maybe you just moved next door and the neighbor IS kind of weird. Like I better stay away, for now. But you would NEVER let too much  time pass before making an effort.? Say it isn't so.



Or , like me, you checked the Index first, for your favorite poets and yes were disappointed to not find some of your favorite poets, and I thought Joris and Rothenberg were respected poets and translators. Could they be so narrow minded?

 You a fan of Jack Spicer? Isn't he an important poet as we face the millennium?

Still not convinced?


From "The Task of the Translator" by Walter Benjamin:

"…a translation, instead of resembling the meaning of the original, must lovingly and in detail incorporate the original's mode of signification, thus making both the original and the translation recognizable as fragments of a greater language, just as fragments are part of a vessel. For  this very reason translation must in large measure refrain from wanting to communicate something, from rendering the sense, and in this the original is important to it only insofar as it has already relieved the translator and his translation of the effort of assembling and expressing what is to be conveyed. In  the realm of translation, too, the words [in the beginning was the word] apply. On the other hand, as regards the meaning, the language of a translation can --- in gact, must -- let itself go, so that it gives voice to the intentio of the original not as reproduction but as harmony, as a supplement to the language in which it expresses itself, as its own kind of intentio. Therefore i

while I'd be the last to criticize rothenberg & joris for leaving out eliot
(and he's not really left out, as various people have noted in intriguing
ways), I might be more bothered by the exclusion of spicer, yet, for
everything I might disagree with there is something else which just amazes
me. I'll point out two --

1.  In vol. 1, pp. 718-724, the amazing work of Yi Sang, whose work I had
not known. The grace combined with eruptiveness of this work is simply
groundbreaking -- and thanks here to Walter Lew for his translations which
make entry into the work possible for those of us who don't read Korean.

2. In vol 2,  pp. 728-732. Here I was ready to be disappointed, because to
select from The Martyrology is to select from the best known and possibly
one of the less 'experimental/alternative' (although I say this with
immense admiration for this work) of bp Nichol. Yet what did Joris &
Rothenberg choose from The Martyrology? They chose work from the sequences
of "Scraptures," which are perhaps the most adventurous, least easily
reconciled part of this work by Nichol, fully representing his good humor,
engaging and generous spirit, and rebellious, endless innovation.


I think that all who read these anthologies carefully, and do not read to
see their favorites (though yes, I admit to looking for Nichol, one of my
favorites), or who is and who is not included, will likely find scores of
examples like this.

The anthology is a wonder. Thank you, Jerry and Pierre.

I would love to hear more consideration of what is IN these anthologies
rather than what is not in them. Particularly, anyone's take on what
surprised them of the inclusions, what was new and exciting to them, or
what raised particular questions for them.

Do Language poets define reading Jordon Davis as evil??

(or, vice verse-ahh....?)

Which is the vice?  (indeed, whose is the verse?)

Are there actually *signs* warning that this the beginning of a Langpo
zone???  (.."Watch out for falling canons!")

Do you avoid the evil of avoidance of complicity in evil by mocking the
poetry of young women??

We may never know the answers to these questions....

Just wanted to observe that the experience of a lot of what is exciting about
the Rothenberg + Joris anthology -- the thrill of finding out about the
completely unexpected poetry of someone like Yi Sang -- can also be found in
Messerli's new magazine --  there is terrific stuff there by contemporary
writers like Mayrocker, & Will Alexander, by modernists such as Picasso,
Peret, & writers new to me at least like Alexi Kruchenykh (b.1886), etc -- and
each selection is accompanied by a concis endnote, particularly helpful given
the international scope of the mag.  As a continuing, evolving & open-ended
project it also avoids the problematic omissions that are inevitable in
anthologies -- definitely worth checking out.

        Have been reading Barrett Watten's new poem "Bad History"  --  and
coming across the section, "Erotica", and this brave, new sentence,
"Schwitters's debt to the structure of his anxiety is reproduced in the
name of Anna Blume."  Schwitters's "An Anna Blume" has always held a
particular fascination for me, personally, as romantic, erotic,
paratactic, and wonderfully ironic.  I'm wondering how/if others are
reading Watten's book, or Schwitters's poem.  I'm wondering, in the face
of my own desire to break with the residual tendencies of "Romantic" voice
and lyric elitism, how efficacious the love poem can be.  What's to be
done with it, what's useful?
        Hope this starts something,

having been away from the list for about 4 days, i'm amazed at the turn of
events. i can practically guaranteee that Miekal is not criticizing Alan
(am i write, miekal?) and the interjection of "fuck" in this case shd not
be taken as a violent gesture of rejectiion but a poeticizing a la lenny
bruce's recuperation of the word.  most folks on the list have expressed
their admiration for alan;s work again and again, although at times
specific work has given rise to compelling controversy. yikes, guyz. chill.

Couldn't disagree more.  But I'm tired of playing the spoiler shutter-downer
of conversations in an alternate universe.  My response: let the intellectuals
work out the intellectual boundaries of the self.  It's all sub-poetry.
This discussion is a-historical in a strictly POETIC HISTORY sense.
Forget about the "self".  Try to understand what "love" might be.  Then
you might take a new tack on the love poem.  Start with some Montale, for
example.  And if you call me Elitist, I will call you a Black Shirt.

                Now children. Let me explain. Tristan Tzara
        was Tristan Tzara. Paul Celan was Paul Celan.
        Paul Celan was a poet. HE was also a translator.

        T.S. Eliot was a  great great poet. He also
        was a translator. But now, children,

        Oh shhh. Be quiet back there. Yes, yes. I know,

        Cd made a typo, oh oh how terrible!

        The Waste Land.

        Millennium.


        There we go. yes, children we don't want to fuse those nouns

        or adjectives.... Now , children, let me explain.

        T.S. Eliot was not St. John Perse.

        So the pome[not a typo but an Irishism]

        is Not by Mr. Eliot.

        However.

        I respect Douglas Barbour enough to see that a discourse

        could arise out of this polemic.

        However on the other hand, this anthology's missing Poet
        makes me think that It is
        like publishing an Anthology of

        North American Poesie and not Including

        Irving Layton. OR Gregory Corso. say. Or scores of others.

        Of course I admire the anthos Millennium as a whole

        But it is a whole with a  ver Big Missing Part.

        Maybe I am wrong and the absence only Proves How Giant
        and gigantic the presence of Eliot's poetry still retains.
        O O O that rage that rage 'agin' the great...

        of poetasters and small time readers, would be poets

        and could a be poets...

        Which is what Harold Bloom does in his funny little list

        at the back of the Western Canon.

        Now BLoom is a critic and makes no claim to be avant-garde,

        marginal, or whatever .

        But he does, in spite of his great personal distaste

        for Eliot include Eliot in his list of books.

        I would say generosity would have been in Order

        in the anthology edited by Rothenberg and Joris.

        In earlier anthologies of Rothenberg Eliot

        is represented as he should be.

        Well children, you know Poets are always fighting.

        yes, its terrible terrible.

        yes, I remember when I met that friend of your father's

        and  Mister Eliot had tea and he spoke so softly

        so much that grandma cld. barely hear him

        then he recited those last lines about the mermaids

        and the waves rolling back


        now that was a pleasure.

        Yes, a  fine one indeed.


        End Game.

        in 1920 Ithink it was Tzara sent some poetry to Eliot.

        Eliot turned it down.

        So it goes. Tzara did very well anyhow.

I'm not sure what you mean by "this discussion"; if we're
talking about the history of the love poem, it has everything
to do with the self. And if we're talking about New Directions
for the love poem, then I really can't see how you can ignore
what's gone before. Not that you have to stick your thumbs in
and skewer yourself on the past, but whatever you come up with
after you've "understood what 'love' might be" is going to have
a lot to do with what everybody else has, whether in opposition
to or collusion with. Not that, when you sit
down to write, you need to run filters and historical analyses
on everything that pops into your mind.

In a way, this really doesn't have much to do with politics,
so "black shirts" and "elitism" are sort of absurd. Rich
writes very "anti-elite" love poetry that still owes most
of its debt to Romantic notions of the self, the lover, and
so on, albeit with a certain consciousness of the dangers of
subject/object. Ginsberg also.

What is the love poem, anyway? If you move it far enough away
from the Romantic notions of self, would people still recognize
it and respond to it as such? There is the erotic poem, certaintly,
but is the love poem merely a codeword for the romantic poem?
"He had an idea about the death of love" -- I wonder what the
poetry of, say, Sappho, would look like if we didn't have
the "Romantics" (in a general sense) between her and us? Look
at what Ovid did to her story; will our visions of "sexual"
poets look just as skewed later?

Oh well, we're all going a-historical, we rememeber what the other one
forgot, blah blah.  "Elite".  Dangers of subject / object.  Romanticism
is a threat in 1998?

Here's something about love, forthcoming in Nedge #6, courtesy of Stuart
Blazer, of Provence, which has some tradition in that line:

When you love you have no eyes
is what she said; you just see love.
She didn't leave until he hurt
the baby.  Young, oriental, scarred,
adopted since five, living now in France.
We wait for the bus, passing time.

Almost beautiful.  I'm a fool for it each time.
Even blind, ears would be my eyes.
It's not just Europe, though granted, it is France.
Whose gestalt makes love
evident:  its signs and scars,
proof that too much pleasure hurts.

A black belt and still she let him hurt
her.  Love, she called it at the time,
so completely scarred
I'm forced to turn my eyes
though who am I to question what they meant by love?
Might as well read de Sade or Anatole France...

Not only the cooking is mouth-watering in France;
hot enough to burn the tongue or at least hurt
you into wanting more, love
here is a way of living time.
Its forms tease and please the eyes
leaving them finally sated, scarred.

Betrayed, disfigured, bruised, scarred
in existential oriental France
where it's a festival of talk with lips and eyes
that keeps on until the whole body hurts,
a kind of tatouage, skin pierced by time
displaying our own and others' love.

Disease and remedy, love
polishes its golden silver scars
brightening our passage through time,
French but not confined to France
it radiates as from a sun a hurt
so essential we both offer then shield our eyes.

When you love you have no eyes
is what she said; you just see love.
"And we came out once more to see the scars."

Romanticism as a reaction to the conditions of 1998
is certaintly a threat -- a retreat into the self.
In the poem you've transcribed for us, it's almost
insidious, since it masqurades a pretty self indulgent
string of cliches as empathy for the characters
involved. This, despite what you might think, is
not a political question. Except on my more liberal
guilty days, I honestly don't give a fuck about the
woman

        Young, oriental, scarred,
adopted since five, living now in France.

The problem is, neither does the poet.

What the original question was on about was questions
of form, which do, of course, always bleed into questions
of subject (part of Todd's point, I believe.) Here the
language is as dull as the narrator.

Well, Simon, if you don't give a fuck then you won't get much about
love, I guess.  But you ought to speak for yourself.  The whole poem
is built around a perception brought on by a dialogue with this woman
at the bus stop.  Maybe you wouldn't have allowed yourself to indulge
your self in such self interaction with another self; more's the pity.

Wonderful; fireworks explode in my brain with the revelation that
this poem is about LOVE. Really, it was quite a shocker. And now
that I know that the poet *actually met* the woman in question, I'm
even more amazed and convinced that this is a good poem.

Sarcasm aside. My point, which you really haven't responded to, is that
the poem is a catalogue of cliche strung together by wretchedly boring
prose. I'm sure the subject matter is important; that doesn't make it
any less worthy of being ignored. Where is the attention to language?
Where is the sensation that this guy has done anything more than throw
the first and completely uninteresting string of metaphors down on the
page?

And I will certaintly speak for myself. I'm sure the actual Stuart Blazer
is a wonderful guy, really friendly, kind to animals and head of the
local chapter of domestic abuse survivors. But if this is what he writes,
then he should stick to writing newspaper columns for his friends back home
who would be alternately shocked, upset and titilated by the stories he
can tell. Not poetry.

I'm just missing the aesthetic experience of appriciating the poem here,
Henry, is the problem. It's reportage dressed up a little and with linebreaks.
Perhaps this exhange should end here, since it's hard to argue someone
into an aesthetic position; you think I'm a philistine or a brute, I
have my own opinions about your taste.

>                Maybe you wouldn't have allowed yourself to indulge
>your self in such self interaction with another self; more's the pity.

Easy there.

As long as we're dragging out romantic love poetry.
Here's a Rich poem -- I had hoped to find her sequence 21 love
poems, but it's not with me right now. This is, for me at least,
a brilliantly delicate love poem -- perhaps too delicate; the
sensation comes to you almost as you finish, or reread. It's not
a poem ABOUT LOVE HERE I AM A POET AND I'M TALKING ABOUT LOVE,
SENSITIVE PEOPLE, LISTEN UP; but it is a love poem.

IN A CLASSROOM

Talking of poetry, hauling the books
arm-full to the table where the heads
bend or gaze upward, listening, reading aloud,
talking of consonants, elision,
caught in the how, oblivious of why:
I look in your face, Jude,
neither frowning nor nodding,
opaque in the slant of dust-motes over the table:
a presence like a stone, if a stone were thinking
What I cannot say, is me. For that I came.

(1986)

I realize that the kind of transcendence espoused in Romanticism has been
questioned, doubted, exposed, even ridiculed. But even so, some kind of
transcendence was indeed the aim of Wordsworth, Keats, et al -- so I don't
think it's quite fair to equate Romanticism with "a retreat intl the self"
-- could you explain why you see it as such?

When I used the phrase "retreat into the self", I was
thinking more of successors to Romanticism, where
the poet walls off the outside world and passes judgement
without empathy; adopts a seemingly superior voice
that is usually just self-centered. The Romantics
themselves, however, did move inwards and develop the
lyric into a means of creating and developing a "self";
I wouldn't call it a retreat, but it is a movement
directed towards a self.

For the Romantics, transcendence came from an examination
of the self as an aspect of God -- "self" and "God" taken
very loosly, of course. But always a looking inwards and
a creation of a voice, an "I" that is observing, developing
and changing as it comes into contact with the outside world --
which may a step down or step up. Wordsworth is an excellent
example -- the _Prelude_ is a "poetic autobiography" with
a number of transcendent moments. The self he creates is
certaintly not Wordsworth in the way the I in Lowell's
_History_ poems are Lowell; Wordsworth doesn't even mention
his parents, although he spends a number of chapters on
his childhood.

The transcendence is of the body and the contingencies of
the world; the Romantic eye looks upon the poet and sees
a core that is, essentially, the poet's muse -- look at
Keats' Ode to a Nightingale -- he hardly even sees the
bird before it's become something that exists to define and
understand his own body/soul. Far different from, say, a moment
in Pound, where physical beauty is more concrete, less
tractable for those trying to find a "little man" behind
the screen of invention.

Meow Press is Moving!

At the end of July, Meow Press will go into boxes and will be moved across
the country to San Diego, California. The ambitious publishing season
announced some weeks ago is ongoing and is shockingly on schedule for the
most part. There should be only a two to four week disruption in printing,
assembly, and shipping of pure-poetry product.

Thanks to those of you who have ordered books from me and those who have
contributed to this project in the last few weeks. You subscribers, my
people, will be taken care of in the next world (ex-post-Buffalo) which
will see many expansions of Meow, into "real" books and also CDs. My name
is Santa and I live on the second floor...another flurry of packages
headed out this weekend...so if you're waiting for something from me
expect it this week.

Orders for backlist items will be accepted for another two weeks or so.
After I move, all bets are off on full-sets and a great deal of the
backlist, as I am not sure I will have materials with me to keep those
books in print. BUY NOW! SPD has more of the books than I do!

The Meow Press address in Buffalo will remain open for another year,
though I will supply a local California address within a week or two. This
email and the meow web address will remain active.

The Fall98 publishing season will see work by Caroline Bergvall, David
Bromige, Jackson Mac Low, among others.

I have never seen an anthology that did not leave out good poets. That is
the nature of anthologies.

Selected poems often leave out good poems.

The American League all-star team leaves out good first basemen.

There have been two Eliot problems raised in the past two days --

One is the impact of his estate making stupid demands that keep the work
from appearing in something akin to Millenium, save by round-about means.

The other is the Eliot as good/bad person thing.

They're really very different issues. The former Eliot shares with the
estates of David Jones and Jack Kerouac. In Jones' case, where many people
don't know the work, it's really regretable. In the other cases, it's mostly
just stupid.

The other question takes us into the quagmire shared by Pound, Spicer and
others, really a reader's problem -- how to handle a writer's racism (or
sexism or or or). Earlier this summer I read Faulkner's Flags in the Dust,
the original version of what was released as Satoris (before Faulkner became
famous and could really publish whatever he wanted). It's a rough work, in
the sense that a book like Visions of Cody is rough, brilliant and awkward
by turns. It's also the most racist work I've ever encountered, just jaw
droppingly so, even though he may have thought himself a liberal by northern
Mississippi 1930s standards. I've always liked Faulkner, since he is the one
writer of his generation besides Stein who seems to have seriously thought
about the sentence as a unit of writing ("thought" might not be the right
word), but it was hard to feel good about liking the writing when has to
wade through the muck.

I think what I like about Blazer's poem is its simplicity and directness in
addressing THE big traditional subject in poetry, while putting it in the
framework of a sestina (in case you hadn't noticed while you scanned his
"prose", the sestina puts him back in the matrix of (post) Provencal
Italian renaissance poetry; his concluding line is a take-off on the last
line of Dante's "Inferno").  He's not trying to be cute, he's not trying
to be postmodern; I don't find the prose boring, just fairly graceful
in the way it moves through the stanzas.  I sent it in because it was so
clearly "about" love and succeeds in that way, as opposed to addressing
the ponderous socio-political questions of "self" which appear to be more
important than the issues of "love" on this thread about love poetry;
an emphasis which seems so parochially American-academic (of about 8
years ago).  There is so much real poetry out there, past and present,
in English and other languages, which is the living tradition itself and
which overshadows these vague philosophical conundrums which are definitely
a sub-subset of style.  Love poetry will always be around; but to measure
it by our own musings on the ontology of "self" seems misplaced.  Sure,
the philosophical issues are important; but maybe it would be good to start
with some poetry.  I know that's exactly what Patrick Durgin did & was trying
to do in starting this discussion & I'm sorry once again to have this blown
out of proportion, so now I will be quiet, let lurkers chirp.

Re: your fantasies about Stuart Blazer: he's been writing & teaching poetry
for decades, going along his own path in his own way, very much out of the
mainstream, very talented.  He had an interesting sort of Poundian poem about
a trip to Morocco in Nedge #4.

geez, i hate to sound in the least aloof or condescending, but two poets
quarreling over what constitutes the proper? approach to a love poem...
wow... i mean, i find the exchange fascinating, simon and henry, but you
needn't be so much at each other, right?...

there's just so much to say, no?... depending on my mood, i like cummings's
stuff (sorry!), i like donne too, barrett browning, creeley and mayer---the
usual suspects, incl. the bard hisself... this is english of course, which
may not be the best language for that sentiment---depending muchly too, i
suppose, on how you've experienced said sentiment, which seems for some
folks to be a matter of being unsentimental, or unsentimental being... i
might have said "i prefer---"

but i'm tempted here to pull a bit against the perceived registers, and say
that sentiment too has its place---direct, unabashed "i luv u" sentiment...
provided, of course, we all keep our wits about us...

anyway, hey---absence makes the heart grow fonder? and we're all about to
be unplugged for a s p e l l, so///

love & kisses,

PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) - Albert Cook, a Brown University professor who published
more than 20 books and plays, died Tuesday of cardiac arrhythmia and coronary
artery disease. He was 72.

The scholar of comparative literature, classics and English wrote criticism,
poetry, plays and textbooks.

He taught at the University of California, Western Reserve University and the
State University of New York at Buffalo before going to Brown in 1978.

*
Forrest Gander just sent this sad news to me. Cook was the key figure in
initially bringing poets, and not incidentally, poetics to SUNY-Buffalo, hiring
Creeley, Olson, Weiners and many others and envisioning an English department
where poets and fiction writers would teach literature, rather than creative
writing, to undergraduates and graduates. Cook founded the UB English
department, and taught there from 1963-1968.  He was the author of  over 20
books of criticism and 8 books of poetry, and the translator of Oedipus Rex and
The Odyssey.

Among his most recent books are Canons and Wisdoms (University of Pennsylvania
Press), Temporalizing Space: The Triumphant Strategies of Piero della Francesco
(Peter Lang), and a collection of poetry, Modes (Mellon).  Other books include:
An Anthology Of Greek Tragedy, The Burden Of Prophecy: Poetic Utterance In The
Prophets Of The Old Testament, Canons and Wisdoms, Changing The Signs: The
Fifteenth-Century Breakthrough,  The Dark Voyage and the Golden Mean; A
Philosophy of Comedy, Enactment: Greek Tragedy, Figural Choice in Poetry and
Art, French Tragedy: The Power Of Enactment, History/Writing, The Meaning of
Fiction, Modulars: Poems, Myth and Lanugage, Progressions and Other Poems, The
Reach of Poetry, The Root of The Thing; A Study of Job and The Song of Songs,
Shakespeare's Enactment: The Dynamics of Renaissance Theatre, The Stance Of
Plato, Thresholds: Studies In The Romantic Experience, and Soundings: On
Shakespeare, Modern Poetry, Plato, and Other Subjects.

        Sorry, I lost the message so will have to do this on the big board,
but then it might be of general interest. There's a very sweet hotel in NYC
called Larchmont Hotel, 27 W. 11th St., heart of the village, just off
Fifth Ave.  It's run like a European place, & is usually full of French
speakers, etc. singles $60. & 70., doubles $85. & 90.,  which includes
continental breakfast, use of umbellas, etc. Baths down the hall, two for
each wing of 5 rooms, which is one reason it's cheap. But super
safe/clean/friendly. Rates I'm giving are as of spring. Tel. 212.989.9333,
fax 212.989.9496. I have the brochure in front of me, so if you want more
info back-channel. My wife stayed there in March,  loved it. Bon voyage!

About that ol' Possum being absent so presently in Poems...:

It is possible that R & J could have included a short poem, say "Morning at
the Window" or, even better, 'Hysteria," but I think it's obvious that for
their purposes "The Waste Land"  is the poem that counts -- and it would
have been prohibitively expensive, warping the anthology they were dreaming
way out of whack.  For me, the poem IS there, & Is invoked in such a way as
to be recognized as the part of the necessary experimentation of early
modernism it so obviously is.

I would suspect that Heaney & Hughes got him because their anthology was
published by Faber & (I would guess) by Eliot's US publisher. Of course,
their anthology (ies?) is (are) attempting something very different from
Poems 1 & 2.

Hey, what I think Jordan may be missing is that a lot of us 'guys' really
appreciate all those women poets & moreover even learn from them as well as
from the men. Contra Bloom, I have no problems with my forbears, & am more
than happy to celebrate the mothers as well as the fathers -- God knows
they taught me well...

First off, thanks for a civilized reply; the e-mail
I sent off last night was over the top. You're right,
of course, that a love poem is about "love" first, and
the self second; and I certainly don't think that poetry
should be in the business of posing, riddle-like,
philosophical questions that critics try to answer.
On the other hand, remember that "vague philosophical
conundrums" have motivated a large amount of poetry.

I still am not a fan of Blazer's poem -- something
essential, fundamental, still seems to be missing
for me; but let that rest.

this part intrigues me. I have been wanting to post about an article on
Gertrude Stein that was in a fairly recent New Yorker (excuse me!) wherein
the author gave a very psychological reading of the lady's life and work.
saying she only wrote 'that way' cause she was scared of her own psychology.
and how V Woolf considered Stein a "generational failure".
my questions:
how is psychology (self?) framed?
is there a new way into interiority? (i expect an immediate and foolproof
response)
does anyone else love the flatness of Stein's characterization (no i must be
the only one)
like the repetition in Ada?
why must Woolf and Stein be opposed in this critical/gossip history? is
their a way to integrate?
(and i know they didn't BOND in REAL LIFE)

excuse me. the New Yorker disturbed me.

ps i just must say that bitterish reference to 'poetry of young women' and
the Possibility of a trajectory (anthology) framed by women's writing sounds
a bit HYSTERICAL!

MIME-Version: 1.0

Everyone:

Reading Carl Kerenyi's _Dionysos, the Archetypal Image of Indestructible Life_
this weekend near Woodstock (trees! streams! no constant low-level hum of
electricity! lots of free marijuana!) I ran across this pretty wonderful
passage on Cretan / Minoan art ... but, now I have a question & thought maybe
someone could help me out, either posting here or backchannel: What does
Kerenyi mean here by "opposite"? I'm totally baffled, have read it to a couple
poet friends & roommate Chris, and, well, we can't figure it out. PLEASE
help!!!

--Gary

Cretan art ignored the terrifying distance between the human and the
transcendent which may tempt man to seek a refuge in abstraction and to create
a form for the significant remote from space and time; it equally ignored the
glory and futility of single human acts, time-bound, space-bound. In Crete
artists did not give substance to the world of the dead through an abstract of
the world of the living, nor did they immortalize proud deeds or state a humble
claim for divine attention in the temples of the gods. Here and here alone the
human bid for timelessness was disregarded in the most complete acceptance of
the grace of life the world has ever known. For life means movement and the
beauty of movement was woven in the intricate web of living forms which we call
"scenes of nature"; was revealed in human-bodies acting their serious games,
inspired by a transcendent presence, acting in freedom and restraint,
unpurposeful as cyclic time itself." --this section is actually a direct quote
from H.A. Groenewegen-Frankfort, from her book _Arrest and Movement_ ... then
Kerenyi says: "Minoan art fully justifies this negative
characterization--negative from the standpoint of man as center, as the vehicle
of his own historical and non-historical glory, but not from the standpoint of
the deity, whose presence it demands and requires. Man is always on the edge of
this epiphany of the spirit--the spirit or spirits of life and nature--if not
face to face with it. In this view an intimation of the godhead could be
manifested not only in a swarm of insects, in birds, or in the beasts of the
sea, but also in a human gesture, and it could in turn determine man's
gestures. ... here I am speaking not of cult gestures side by side with other
equally characteristic gestures of simple human existence, but of *the* gesture
which time and time again, in different forms of movement, represents the
identical situation of man: his non-central position which demands an
"opposite" and can be understood only as an "opposite." ..."

PS: Some of you will note that this book wasn't on my list of summer
"plan-to-read"s. So, why am I reading it & not the "planned" books? A
confession: I am a really, really, really bad planner ...

Kerenyi seems to be making a lot of
his argument through visual analogy;
man is moved from the center of the
Minoan/Cretan attention, but since
man (according to K) will by default
place himself in the center (geocentric,
heliocentric...) of the universe, the
decentering must introduce a second
element of equal or greater importance to
remove the asymmetry. This is the "opposite",
towards which, it seems, man is making
his gesture; because the tendency to
anthropcentrism is so strong, this
"opposite" is important only in as much
as it alters this fundamental parameter
of life.

It is a well written passage; I'm not
sure if it holds together, however --
K seems to be somewhat amazed at the
conclusion of his thesis, and wants to
retract some of the apparent strangeness
of the Minoans by understanding their
art as a spiritual geometric modification
of the Western Renaissance.

I just finished reading Richard Caddell and Peter Quartermain's intro to
their forthcoming anthology Other British and Irish Poetry since 1970,
as currently given at Jacket#4.  Having read a number of anthology intros
over the years, I was not surprsied to recognize these latest historical
narratives and critical syllogisms: they are familiar.

But what would an anthologist's rhetoric of contemporaneity be like if
she or he were not to use the spatial metaphor "center/periphery" nor the
diction of "mainstream," "other," and "margin"?

These narratives, syllogisms, metaphors, and dictions are assumed to have
efficacy; they organize and reveal and overcome x, y, and z.  They
also can bore.

I still crave a polemical collection that if it dare not dispense with
the editorial introduction, will somehow tell me a surprising story
about where and how and why and when poetry tumbles into existence.

Since a few of the poets named in the introduction participate on this list
from time to time, perhaps they might weigh in on The Way To Introduce
Anthologized Poetry.

Must I always pass through the same gate presided over by the same authorities
in order to reach your poems?

No, you're certainly not the only one. Many love it. It too is a landscape,
and one certainly of love, at times.


>why must Woolf and Stein be opposed in this critical/gossip history?

because we (the vague overwhelming general pronoun here) seem to love
simplicities, dualities. Someone (and the New Yorker is more than sometimes
complicit in this) seems to want a nice packaged one-flavor modernism.
There may be a sexist thing going on here, too -- let's not admit both such
women into this company -- but that's somewhere way behind the scenes.

>excuse me. the New Yorker disturbed me.

In the last bunch of years I've been disturbed, as I would imagine many
have, by characterizations of Stein and/or her work in the New  Yorker, the
New York Times, and other large cultural/media organs of information
dissemination, sometimes this dismissal by hack journalists, sometimes by a
more 'realistic' writer such as Cynthia Ozick -- here I am reminded of
Hejinian and other's notion that "realism too is an '-ism.'"
 Disturbed often enough that I just can't pay that much attention to the
Stein naysayers anymore.

So I then go back to Stein and her work.
and maybe it's not so flat.
maybe it's round:

        This is a little a scene.
        Just when will they go by adapting.
        Nor may they be merrily there. To share.
        Justly. In why.
        It is a round movement this. Because. Declared.
        For it. It is. A Wonder. Because. They. Were. Spared.
        Might it be agreeable if it were a mistake.

I guess what disturbs me most about all who would throw out Stein, flat or
round, is just that I have a hard time imagining that people's first take
on Stein is not simply finding that her work is so agreeable.

flat or round
with approval of new yorker or not
and without casting out virginia woolf, either -- the flatness or roundness
can accomodate both, and more.

        Henry,
        I should clarify, perhaps.  The discussion is not so a-historical,
as I see it.  By bringing up the Schwitters piece, I meant to begin to
consider what "love" is (which pretty obviously calls the "self" into
question continuously and in very palpable ways) and how the poem which
includes it, comments upon it, can be of service to one's personal
history.  Love is not what it used to be when I first read the poem in
high school.  Neither am I, my"self".
        Todd's comments are welcomed, and I pretty much agree.  For all of
Da-da poetics's supposed nihilism, this poem is remarkably both dismissive
and celebratory.
        It might be interesting to hear from those reading Watten, to come
at these issues from "Bad History"'s trajectory.  What that is, I'm still
discovering.

Why not write one yourself??

If the rhetoric, analysis, metaphors, that are dominating discussion seem
unuseful to ya, or questionable, why not develop your own analysis that'll
show us what you think really *does* need to be said? It would certainly
be the best way to explain (and argue compellingly for) your feeling that
these other accounts are inadequate.

The point about spatial metaphors is a good one.  Important too.  Natch,
we've gone around on that one on the List more than once before (as you
probably remember also)...but without i hasten to add settling anything.
As part of one of those earlier threads, i explained my violent opposition
to the term "avant-garde," pointing out that it's a military term that
isn't helpful or relevant to the activities of poetry.  (and of course it
carries its own spatial logic, one of advancing armies meeting at a
frontline area for combat, rather then of center and periphery...) But i
dislike and object to all the rest of 'em as well..

One of the problems is that, perhaps a whole cognitive realignment will be
needed, before people stop talking center & periphery.  On the other hand
(and even more problematically) maybe it will take a complete realignment
of the economy, the publishing, distribution and teaching institutions
themselves.  I mean, there is a reason that spatial metaphors appeal so to
people and it ain't just lack of imagination..When the main teaching
anthologies contain as much Stein or Zukofsky as Richard Wilbur and Robert
Lowell, spatial metaphors of exclusion and clash won't occur so readily to
people who know the former are more interesting than the latter...

The post i read just before yours, about the "psychopathology" attack on
Stein, is (to use an appropriate word) symptomatic.  That is just the
umpteenth recycling of the infamous attack on her during her career by BF
Skinner.

So, here is one story (sorry it's not more surprising): poetry tumbles
into existence, but like people making history in marx's famous phrase, it
doesn't tumble into existence just however it pleases:  it does so in
circumstances it didn't choose, in a fallen world of workshops and
Possumless anthologies and listservs..........

I like Gary Roberts' thoughts on this & would suggest an anthology based on
a filter of style understood in terms of certain categories.  Set aside the
conflict-of-interested literary maneuvering: set aside a chronological
approach except within the terms of the defined style parameters.

Example: taking off on something Simon Dedeo said about romanticism,
make an anthology based on a kind of realism/nominalism spectrum,
where realism would be understood as foregrounding "objective description" -
Pound's imagism, no-idears-button-things, the Objectivists, the whole
anti-personal "epic" thrust of 20th-cent poetry.
At the other end of the spectrum would be poetry which "objectifies"
itself as object (the Objectivists sort of were planted at the cusp of this
position), leading maybe to language poetry etc.  This end would include
poetry valorized also by the New Critics.
   Then you'd do another anthology of the subjective/informal stream,
which is just as important.  & you'd be surprised at the confusion of
"mainstream/marginal" and "innovative/traditionalist" categories...

Maybe the millennium antho does this, I don't know.

Another anthology: the generic buddy anthology, entitled
Me & My Gang - which would only include real gang members and
would have to define its poetics in a forthright & complete manner
& not include any of their noble forebears or purported Ancestors in
Genius.

Gary Roberts asked: "Must I always pass through the same gate presided over by
the same authorities in order to reach you...?" Gary? Let me introduce an idea
I've been toying with for the last ten minutes:

Blurbs in Everyday Life

Roommate Chris Stroffolino shares his condiments and ground coffee like an
angel-headed Daffy Duck trying to break through the cartoon world into a
rigorously codified "everyday life." Lease-bound, currently employed,
Stroffolino doesn't mix plastics with glass or newspaper, preferring Lefebvre's
space to Bachelard's. "I'm going/ out/ with Rachel/ tonight," Stroffolino
urges, with such insistence you have no choice but to believe him. If roommates
are the "unacknowledged legislators of the Chore Wheel," Stroffolino's broad
sweeping gestures "clean up the house," like they say. The legitimate heir of
Brent Sunderland.

Non-romantic Female Friend Fatimah Tuggar returns all calls within the hour
with the insistence and urgency of a thousand ringing telephones, and expects
you to do the same. Tuggar never lets you forget she's every bit the Leo that
you are. Whether sharing the new Wilt Stillman movie on 19th & Broadway or
eating Indian food at Panna II, no other Non-romantic Female Friend so openly &
fully articulates the "why" of "Men Basically Suck"--or is as eager to hear
about your own sexual frustration. Taking her cues from previous NrFFs such as
Maria Damon and Pamela Z, Tuggar offers the perfect blend of ideas, emotion,
experience and, that crucial but too-often missing element in M/F
relationships: humor. If it weren't for the occasional awkward moment of sexual
tension, you'd admit it without hesitation or stuttering: "You're really my
best friend." Highly recommended.

Workmates Brenda Iijima and Elizabeth Caine team up during break periods to
offer you a choice: Smoking or non? Whether sharing poems, or griping about the
office tattle-tale, Iijima and Caine offer empathy, support and the mutually
held conviction that all dead-end jobs, including this one, exist for these
moments tenderly held together. "Fifteen minutes with you," Smiths frontman
Morrissey once whined, "Ooooh, I wouldn't say no" ? and neither will you. How
could you?

Estranged Best Friend Erik Belgum's recent e-mails urge the reader toward
reconciliation, reconnection. The poignancy of "Maybe someday we can talk about
it" juxtaposed side-by-side with good-natured jokes about the arrogance of,
say, Richard Kostelanetz, imply that connection still exists, however tenuous.
Though lacking the depth of its previous incarnation, the surface of this
relationship shimmers with the brilliant light of possibility reflecting off
the shards of all our earlier lives. Who was it--Heidegger?--no, maybe Adorno ?
well, it doesn't really matter, I don't even remember the quote itself. Belgum
is making a comeback, determined to take the stage with Stroffolino, Tuggar,
Iijima, Caine and others. Can you spell A-n-t-h-o-l-o-g-y o-f N-e-w
A-m-e-r-i-c-a-n F-r-i-e-n-d-s? What logically follows "A"? B, as in Belgum. Put
him in yours.

Okay ... you get the idea ...

Yours,

Gary

gary r.: I  too tire of staid introductions to anthologies (though i don't really
like the anthology form that much, it is really someone else doing the
work for you and putting such a spin on it, though sometimes, i know,
they are all we can get), though i doubt i would find caddell's and
quartermain's so; but jeez, man, work on your own, that's the ticket isn't
it, even if you don't have a publisher asking YOU  to cull a collection and
write an intro, you might be surprised what could  happen if you DID cull
a selection and propose to introduce it as you say. how bout that?

i have to admit this, though, by way of a question: who published the
C&Q anthology on Brits and mics?; in this case, there is so much irish
stuff (at least) that is hard to find, or expensive i should say....  a howdy
to Irishman Randolph Healey, whose work i hope is in that anthology, i
think randolph is a fellow on this list. His Arbor Vitae is very interesting
poem indeed, but only available in a chapbook.

And, gary r., i have to point out that yhou have complained about the
center/periperhy dyad common to poetry introductions only to introduce
your own about a gate, being outside it or inside it. as beckett says,
"don't indict the words, they're no shoddier that what they peddle."

>>> UB Poetics discussion group 07/10/98 02:13pm >>>
I just finished reading Richard Caddell and Peter Quartermain's intro to
their forthcoming anthology Other British and Irish Poetry since 1970,
as currently given at Jacket#4.  Having read a number of anthology intros
over the years, I was not surprsied to recognize these latest historical
narratives and critical syllogisms: they are familiar.

But what would an anthologist's rhetoric of contemporaneity be like if
she or he were not to use the spatial metaphor "center/periphery" nor
the
diction of "mainstream," "other," and "margin"?

These narratives, syllogisms, metaphors, and dictions are assumed to
have
efficacy; they organize and reveal and overcome x, y, and z.  They
also can bore.

I still crave a polemical collection that if it dare not dispense with
the editorial introduction, will somehow tell me a surprising story
about where and how and why and when poetry tumbles into existence.

Since a few of the poets named in the introduction participate on this list
from time to time, perhaps they might weigh in on The Way To Introduce
Anthologized Poetry.

Must I always pass through the same gate presided over by the same
authorities
in order to reach your poems?

Gary R.

i just want to rant about the new yorker's article on stein which managed
to be about as snidely dismissive as a positive article could be.  the use
of biography there could be well used in a course on the use and abuse of
biography as a critical tool.  obviously, the writer had no time for
stein's experiments in language, but says rather that they were way to
avoid confronting herself.  i.e. stein should have written more like
Kathryn Harrison.  what this shows is that whatever poets understand by
the terms "self" & "reality" today, the popular press clings to a
victorian notion, with a soupcon of freud (or rather Ego-Psych).  And it
ain't pretty, as far i am concerned.  i suppose when the new yorker
publishes the occasional literary treacle, it provides an opportunity to
vent spleen, or cancel a subscription, but it is rather worrying that
newspapers of record (the Times), literary reviews (the Oxford Dons of the
New York Review and the London Review), etc, cling to a premodern notion
of literature.  when faced with such frustration, i often agree with Blake
that "That which can be made explicit to the idiot is not worth my care,"
but ultimately for the sake of literary culture, this is a very dire
situation.

for instance, consider the preference for round over flat characters, as
in the ritual complaint, "David Foster Wallace [or insert your favorite
misread writer] creates programmatic characters, whom, for all the
brilliance of their talk and the quirkiness of their actions, never come
alive for this reader."  This is patent nonsense.  Characters in a novel,
play, poem, are not alive--they are not dead either, but is a confusion
about what it means to suspend disbelief.  (After all, however much we
believe in the Ancient Mariner, we don't expect to meet him at the grocery
store).  "Roundness", "Aliveness", etc, are the shibboleths of the rear
guard of realism, firmly entrenched in literary journalism in america.  it
is an easily deconstructed binary (are Dickens' characters round or flat?
Doestevksi?  if they are flat, why do they seem alive), which designates
not an argument, but the likes and dislikes of the reader.  Parse the
sentence above as "I don't like the characters of Wallace's fiction" and
it makes sense.

such a distinction seems even more odd now, because the characters that
are the most memorable in today's popular culture are cartoons (the
Simpsons, King of the Hill), the gang on Seinfeld, and Mulder & Scully.
The cartoons are flat by definition, while I dare say that the best
episodes of Seinfeld are dadaistic riffs on the way we live now. the spate
of columns that used Seinfeld as an index for the increasing meanness of
the culture last year was hilarious, though it proved neither Quayle nor
journalists understood Murphy Brown. as for Mulder & Scully, even their
palpable attraction suggests not a rich inner life, but a knowing wink on
the part of Chris Carter about eighties' narratives of opposites
attracting, as well as the extradiegetic knowledge on our part that such a
romance would mean the end of the X-Files. popular culture has become
modern, even post-modern, while literary journalists subscribe to the
outmoded fashions of realism, desiring coherence and straightforward plot,
legible character and prosaic epiphanies. i'm not saying that such
criticism should be censored or such works of art be banned--i love a
juicy anachronism as much as the next person.  i am saying that forget
about the liberal bias of the press, let's talk about the realistic bias
of literary reviewers.

here endeth the lecture (and i know i am preaching to the choir).

The wonder of Stein has always been , fr me, the language as a COMPOSING
TOOL--not one which reports. So, for yr question there--about "interior"
I think the way is always the same--a construction of grammar is a
construction of the self. Stein's "voice" is not a personaility--which
so many hate her for--or blame her for--anymore than the architecture of
Neutra or Schindler is a direct read of them"selves". Stein
constructed--and attempted to get to a construction of the poem, the
play, the fiction, the essay. Thus, by her composing a world through
noitcing a world by composing a world she asked "what is a sentence. A
sentence is a part of speech." & " How is sentiment maintained. A
pause."  Here I might sound like a fool in love (sic) but here I must
say that Stein's composing a world(sound) through the grammatical is
indeed a grammar of the self that need not focus on the one interiority.

Perhaps I've been inside too long and need the sun--or
perhaps "a grammar relates to not liking to see again those you used to
know."

A child, my fellow list-mate, could have figured out that T.S.Eliot has a poem in Volume 1 of_ Poems For The Millennium_. YOU however did not know this because you have a strategy and agenda which we are not privy to. A child, however , could figure out with very little assistance that T.S. Eliot signed his name to a translation of a St.-John Perse poem. A child however, would not be as convinced as you seem to be that Tristan Tzara is Tristan Tzara or Paul Celan is Paul Celan, etc. On some level CD I don't know what the HELL you are talking about. You are chattering , thinking your words say  what they are saying.  Meanwhile, A CHILD would be delighted by your non-sense AND still be able to turn one page . ONE PAGE, instead of trying to teach us "children" a lesson.

Ok. Well what about another lesson.

William Carlos Williams wrote this in an essay :

"Destruction according to the Babylonia order of creation, comes before creation. . . . We must be destructive first to free ourselves from forms accreting to themselves forms we despise. Where does the past lodge in the older forms? Tear it out." And

"to destroy the past is precisely a service to tradition".

"The destruction of historical forms, of the tyrannous designs (the "TEXTS") of history . . .

(ie. Anthologies, and doesn't this volume by Joris & Rothenberg have as one of its projects, to tear out  and free itself from the dusty old notions about anthologies?)

. . . opens up rather than closes the possibility of signification and mandates the freedom that must be like the beginning".


 In that sense this "anthology" is the best thing that could have happened to T.S. Eliot. It dusts off the old anthologized T.S.Eliot. But guess what? To re-configure Eliot into a counter-poetic tradition , we have to do the work instead of letting Harold Bloom do it for  us. If we care, we have to find Eliot's poetry ourselves, and figure out for ourselves what that gaping hole on page 382 should be filled with, or even WHY it should be filled (depending on our mood: are we for or against inclusion? : both delighted and/or anguished by the absence?)




My last post got cut off 3 times in transmission. It was a digression on [1]feuding neighbors , [2]George Oppen's breakthrough year of 1966 , [3]mentioning(s) that some of the "absent poets" ( ie T.S. Eliot or Jack Spicer) from the  _Poems For The Millennium_   ARE included as translators and [4]a quote from Walter Benjamin's "Task of the Translator", which may be seen as situating the translator's task within the (to quote Giorgio Agamben) scission wherein "Criticism is born". An extreme point in Western culture situated where the word comes unglued from itself: " and it points, on the near or far side of that separation , toward a unitary status for the utterance".

OR:

Stated another way, my fellow-list mate CD, you DID NOT TURN the page, as any child could do and WOULD if  the sophisticated adult in us would stay out of the picture. OK?

 For example, show a child, still learning to read, the letters T-S-E-L-I-O-T, hand him Volume 1 of _  Poems For The Millennium_ , turn to page 382, tell the child to identify the Letters T-S-E-L-I-O-T,  all in a row . Then say, my dear child TURN the page to 383. Good, that's correct  these letters don't occur all in a row there. Ok, what about the next page? Oh, yes the letters T-S-E-L-I-O-T  do occur on page 384. Very good . What's that you say? Yes, ok he is mentioned again on page 385.  And you're only four years old?( I guess it just takes the CURIOSITY of child sometimes.)

 That means, precious, that someone with those letters signed his name to a poem, changed the arrangement of the letters of French to an order in English.


You, however , CD can't turn the page. Or refused to. Ok it may be hard as an adult BUT : a child could do it. You possibly did not have hands when you wrote this on the 8 July:

> I find it very strange that this anthology Poems for the Millenium
> has not one poem by T.S. Eliot.






I am reminded of Michael Palmer's "Autobiography 3" :



Yes, I was born on the street known as Glass--as Paper,
Scissors or Rock.

Several of my ancestors had no hands.

Several of my ancestors used their pens

in odd ways.


Later on in  "Autobiography 3" are these lines:



Once I bought an old boat.

I abandoned the tyrannical book of my dreams

and wrote about dresses, jewels, furniture and menus

eight or ten times in a book of dreams.

It sets me to dreaming when I dust it off.

Our time is a between time; best to stay out of it.



 To summarize :I'm not buying your old boat CD. Perhaps a poem by T.S. Eliot has too much dust on it right now. Joris and Rothenberg , by including "not one poem" have afforded those of us who care to, an opportunity to dust off a 'pome' by TSE so as to "re-contextualize" it in  terms of a "counter-poetic" tradition.{ a tradition which "counters", or counter-memorizes the open tomb of Modernism, which is a double opening: the poetic resistance to history's closure.( Joseph Riddel's ideas in his book_ The Inverted Bell_ are being borrowed here) }.

 T.S. Eliot has been abandoned to this open tomb of 'modernist practices', and tyrannical anthologies for too long, as Mark Scroggins points out in his post to the list yesterday. Therefore, the "real" T.S. Eliot may AND may not be a poem by St.-John Perse. ( Although, you would be hard pressed to convince me that Eliot is or  was an ancestor of mine with hands; or  that  he did have a hand in a translation, and EVEN used his pen. And I'm not talking metaphorically. He literally did not have hands. If you want my self-important explanation, please back channel). ie,  I hate Eliot's "back-channeled" , less overt , form of anti-semitism. Less overt than Pound, that is.

 This remark by Emmanuel Levinas in_ Nine Talmudic Readings_ seems crucial during this "between time":

"For we assume the permanence and the continuation of Israel and the unity of its self-consciousness throughout the ages. Finally, we assume the unity of the consciousness of mankind, claiming to be fraternal and one throughout time and space.It is Israel' history which has suggested this idea, even if mankind, now conscious of its oneness, allows itself to challenge Israel's vocation, its concrete universality. Does not antisemitism, a phenomenon unique in its kind, attest to its translogical nature?"

A child, my fellow list-mate, could have figured out that T.S.Eliot has a poem in Volume 1 of_ Poems For The Millennium_. YOU however did not know this because you have a strategy and agenda which we are not privy to. A child, however

   Jordan asks--I think--about literature of interest re male gaze...
   well been thinking been wanting to rant about that Wayen Kostenbaum
   piece on Vanessa Beecroft in the latest ARTFORUM lately and
   so will well he begins the piece with going to see a Jane Frielecher
   show and expressing boredom (or more likely ENNUI) at--not at the
   work per se (nor have I seen it nor will judge but that's the issue
   HERE)--but at the MEDIUM (can you BELIEVE that it's 1998 and some
   people still PAINT on WALLS and only on WALLS?" come on now, he'd
   probably add, this is the error of the HUGO BOSS PRIZE and that
   souglass clown and his slowed-down 24 hour version of PSYCHO and
   the sequel currently at the guggenheim)....
   After, claiming the PASSE quality of the MEDIUM or GENRE in which
   frielicher works, he moves on to praise (i think it's praise)
   Beecroft's show of 20 or so models, 5 naked, all but 5 wearing
   clothes by GUCCI GUCCI GUCCI. A "by invite only" show (but they
   invite a lot of people it says here)--therefore "special." Kostenbaum
   is simply ASTOUNDED that skinny model women's legs do not touch
   at their crotch. And this is the NEW ART, the "interactive"
   "installation piece." Question: am I silly or just plain "out of
   the ballpark" for imagining the scene at this show, as stiff and
   stuffy???? Would rather see the frielicher, and then maybe go to
   a topless cabaret a certain A. Berrigan told me about--no GUCCI
   at least there, one step closer to the more "naked" voyeurism
   i assume is more available at the kind of strip clubs guiliani
   wants to close down (i did go once with fellow Hard Press author
   Sharon Messmer; i wonder if the baby doll lounge made the AX)....
   Well, have I made my preferences "clear"?
   And, no, I'm not going to retell the story about baby's first reading
   with Bernstein in 89 and his public response to my early poem
   "blackburniana", but I may mention that my recent, as yet unpublished
   piece "NUDE" (which I really should remember to send to Eileen Myles
   after hearing her portrait of the male nude model she had "sit" for
   her creative writing class--but this is the "female gaze" or at least
   one of them) was rejected by Mark Nowak's magazine (I forget the name
   I always get it confused with that thing in philly). I had sent
   it in response to his call for his "VOYEUR/VOYAGER" issue, but
   I guess he didn't want something so much VOYEUR as VOYAGER, or
    if he sees the two as one, he sees the VOYEUR as a kind of VOYAGER
    whereas I might be interested in figuring the VOYAGER as a kind
    of VOYEUR, a line of emphasis (my sister prefered to be "lost in
space" too "lost lost i want you lost" as Frank O'Hara says)
so drowning in a liquor not yet brood

Oh well, we're all going a-historical, we rememeber what the other one
forgot, blah blah.  "Elite".  Dangers of subject / object.  Romanticism
is a threat in 1998?

Here's something about love, forthcoming in Nedge #6, courtesy of Stuart
Blazer, of Provence, which has some tradition in that line:

When you love you have no eyes
is what she said; you just see love.
She didn't leave until he hurt
the baby.  Young, oriental, scarred,
adopted since five, living now in France.
We wait for the bus, passing time.

Almost beautiful.  I'm a fool for it each time.
Even blind, ears would be my eyes.
It's not just Europe, though granted, it is France.
Whose gestalt makes love
evident:  its signs and scars,
proof that too much pleasure hurts.

A black belt and still she let him hurt
her.  Love, she called it at the time,
so completely scarred
I'm forced to turn my eyes
though who am I to question what they meant by love?
Might as well read de Sade or Anatole France...

Not only the cooking is mouth-watering in France;
hot enough to burn the tongue or at least hurt
you into wanting more, love
here is a way of living time.
Its forms tease and please the eyes
leaving them finally sated, scarred.

Betrayed, disfigured, bruised, scarred
in existential oriental France
where it's a festival of talk with lips and eyes
that keeps on until the whole body hurts,
a kind of tatouage, skin pierced by time
displaying our own and others' love.

Disease and remedy, love
polishes its golden silver scars
brightening our passage through time,
French but not confined to France
it radiates as from a sun a hurt
so essential we both offer then shield our eyes.

When you love you have no eyes
is what she said; you just see love.
"And we came out once more to see the scars."

Gary,

I think you'll find the referent for "opposite" on the same page [11 in
my paperback Bollingen ed.], which you quote below: "the standpoint of
the deity,' as confirmed on page 12, where he says that "the
Minoan gesture . . . revelas man in a wholly religious situation: not
oriented solely toward himself and his fellow men, but determined by
something other, something outside hmiself, caught up in an atmosphere
of festival as in an enchanted world." Further down the same page he
says that "the Minoan bull game was clearly a festive game. In honor of
whom? The Great Goddess of nature and life? Nikolaos Platon drewthis
inference from his interpretation of Minoan art. In his view, the
goddess was the divine onlooker, the 'opposite' . . ."

Check out (in one of my *favorite* books _Breaking the Sequence: Women's
Experimental Fiction_ by Ellen Friedman & Miriam Fuchs) the essay:
"Woolfenstein" by Rachel Blau DuPlessis. She manages to not ignore the two
women's obvious differences, but doesn't let them get in the way of an
intertextual analysis. Her reading of _The Waves_ as influenced by Stein's
"beginning again"-ness (among other things) is way cool. Princeton U,
publishers.

Actually, I was thinking of love in a slightly different context yesterday. I
don't know who it was who said we can learn morality from novels, but I started
thinking again about the "people" I've learned most from (& loved) and made my
not complete but pretty close list:

Emma Bovary
Anna Karenina
Kate Pointellier
Isabel Archer
Tess Durbeyfield
Molly Bloom
(& Leopold)

Anyone listees with characters they feel really speak to "how one lives one's
life"?

P.S. Elizabeth: I too love the "flatness" of Stein--and see it a bit, perhaps,
in _Orlando_,
though I love Woolf best in her "roundness" (_To the Lighthouse_).

Tina Brown used to run Vogue or Mademoiselle or something similarly
femme. They
brought her on as editor to make the NYer more trendy.

So the New Yorker likes Jorie Graham but not Stein. Perhaps they like
writers who
write round but are flat, vs flat writers who are round in person.

Secretly though I think Stein is often dismissed because her haircut was

too
butch. Seriously.

"No one today hopes to conduct the psychology of the future in the
vocabulary of the neurophysiologist , let alone that of a physicist, and
principled ways of relaxing the classical "rules" of reduction have been
proposed."---from The Intentional Stance by Daniel C. Dennett
---
Then for all practical purposes, everyone takin' the money does exactly
what Dennett claims they won't do, e.g. ground psychology in
neuroscience, communication theory, AI, mathematics, engineering and, of
course, physics.

Gary,

As a footnote to my earlier reply, a statement by the Jungian analyst
Edward C. Whitmont [in _The Return of the Goddess_]: "Life as a dramatic
play, as theater (_theatron_ in Greek meant a place for seeing, but
especially 'A SHOWPLACE FOR DIVINE ONLOOKERS'), is an archetypal motif
recurring over and over in dreams and poetry" (qtd. in Stephen Larsen,
_The Mythic Imagination_ 29). [my caps; Whitmont may echo Kerenyi's
phrase here].

For the record: yes, it would be wonderful to have a publisher ASKING us or
me to
cull a collection. Ric Caddel and I nattered together about this anthology
for a
couple of years before actually doing anything substantial about it, and it
took
more than another two years, and a LOT of work,  to find a publisher courageous
enough (or foolish enough) to risk it. We're both thankful indeed that
Wesleyan UP /

The book itself won't be out till December, but (as

What does stroffolino mean when he "speaks" of ""barthes "speaks" of
mythical speech's "benumbed look" ""? The stroffolinolion quotes split
our attention toward the author, the authored, and the relation between
them in the way that "clams" are the closest thing to "bait" I can think
of. Barthes is writing of the unfolding of a name, since the character
who says "I" has no name but at the same time "I" immediately becomes a
name. To say ""barthes 'speaks'" inevitably attributes signifieds into
plurality, a biographical duration where one cannot return to barthes
who can never ride a horse with no name.

Ron I disagree. I believe the eliot good/person bad person thing is
genetic. Therefore the same issue up and through the millenium.

Thinking about the gazes, I think male / male, female / female, are
doing wild recasts recently.

There are other ways to get there. For variants sake, one can pass
through the unoccupied tollhouse gate pre-sided in wood shingles by
someone whose receipt for the work was lost, was not recorded, in order

Here's a dialogue I'm very interested in starting:

As one of a few (comparatively) MAs--MFA--etc. with a degree in
Poetics--I'm wondering what listees think of Poetics (versus Creative
Writitng: not a program where one works on one's own work--but a poetics
dept. like Naropa, New College, Buffalo) Departments and their affect of
Poetics.  Under the "leadership" of Duncan McNaughton and Louis Patler,
under the teaching of M. Palmer, David Meltzer, Lyn Hejinian--I gradued
in 1990 from New College. The program was then not a creative writing
program per se: we had to do grad. level work and writing to earn our
degrees--a thesis--and I "think" I know how the study of Olson, The
Romantics, Oppen, Dickinson, Basic Texts (Aristotle, etc), Whitman and
the texts that influenced their poetics has affected my work as a poet.
But:

I recently asked the question of "affect" of Charles B. and the idea has
flown about in my head for awhile-- The question is throughly documented
in terms of Visual/Plastic Arts dept.s: How Cal-Arts affects the Arts
(heavily conceptual)--how Black Mountain affected the Arts--How R.I.S.D
, Irivine, UCSD, or etc. has affected a dialogue in the visual arts. We
know that critics--that theory--that work itself comes from these
schools: But I'm wondering if those out there
involved/enrolled/graduated from could speak to the question:

What affect do Poetics/Poetry Dept. degrees and programs actually have
on cont. poetry and poetics.

Since some of these places are not strictly  "academic"(as New C.
wasn't) How do these dept.s enlarge their circle of influence? Think of
Black Mountain--and who/what came from there under Olson.  Think of the
myriad of publications that appear from these places (Apex of the M,
Tripwire--some ones that recently come to mind)

I'm meandering abit--but the question is large. Since the question has
been raised about academic studies in lit. here in general.

thanks for all,

I am glad to have gotten my digest. I guess some mail is getting through. There was a posting that it was shutdown for the weekend.??

 Todd Baron. I am unable to answer your question, except indirectly. I do wonder, as you do, how various poetics programs will and promote the dissemination, ie teaching, writing, editing of poetry. I have only ever taken one post-graduate poetry/poetics seminar, one semester, fortunately with William Slaughter , at Univ. of North Florida, seven years ago, before he launched and edited MUDLARK (part of the List group here as you probably know).The class was overbooked as it was, and I had to get special permission from the instructor to get into the class, but by showing genuine interest I had my ticket in NO questions asked.

The only poets I had read on my own outside the classroom because I wanted to, were Stevens, Raymond Carver, and Rilke ( because Carver mentioned him in a few poems, and in his short story "The Student's Wife", written when he was only around 23 years old, by the way). Yet this little bit of interest was all it took , and gradually I wanted to find out more. Until then, I had never dreamed that there were writers like Oppen or Reznikoff or Robert Duncan ,Creeley and Olson, Michael Palmer& Zukofsky, or _Sulfur_ mag,etc. I remember looking at _A_ seven years ago and feeling like it was impenetrable. Resisting it, somehow. Oh, well...blah, blah, blah. Now, I jump into it from time to time.I am astounded at times, and still befuddled, of course.

 These kinds of stories are a dime- a- dozen, I know , so sorry for the boring home movie.

Yet , I'm kind of connected ("virtually connected") to the Buffalo Poetics program, though my grades were lousy in college,and with  no publications, etc., I would never be accepted into any kind of a poetics progam like this one which can choose from among the best of the best.  And YET, I am a part of it too! I was welcomed to the Listserv, no questions asked. Ain't it a gas! Think of it Todd. I can look up Charles Berstein's or Susan Howe's syllabus (or is it syllabi?) for their classes! So , what does that say about the influence of this particular poetics program?


Anyhow, I was fortunate to have a fine teacher, and just one course is all it took to help me find my way . The testimony of one teacher was the signpost needed.. And since I work in the public schools, well won't I be more effective in the classroom because in a sense, I AM part of this 'Poetics' program, through EPC?(Though of course human interaction in a physical classroom setting , interacting with the teacher and classmates is obviously the best way to go.)

As Carver might say, this is 'gravy'.

Sympathies with Gary Roberts, even as we trot out the lines he finds
over-familiar, the centre/ periphery mainstream/ margin monoculture/
plurality rag. I get tired of it too, and wish it was no longer necessary
to say it. But - this is the point - it's where I (and the other Others)
live. As we try to suggest in our intro (invoking Matthias from three
decades ago and Langland from the 14th cent) it's not a new thing: the
pluralities of the culture of these islands seem always to be "outside".
Why, it got so bad at some points that people just sailed away from it...

Yes, Healy's there, and I guess many - er - Others who may or may not be
known to members of this list, but who remain for the most part firmly
unknown and yes, marginalised at our end.  But at this point in the
process I lie awake nights fretting about the other Others, the ones we
had to leave out in what is self-evidently a non-canonical plural
presentation rather than a group show. The telling of the wheres hows n
whys which Gary craves would thus be a book at least as long as this 352pp
collection, rather than an introduction to it. Someone should write it.

Hi Todd,

I wanted to say a word about the Creative Writing/Poetics Program split
you
seem to suggest. As an undergrad in visual arts, I learned to critique
and
respond to the work of other visual artists "around" me (conceptually,
in
that some worked in other historical times), and be involved in and
aware of
their work & its influences on mine. I was surprised in grad school
(creative writing) to find that there were students there who seemed to
expect to be *taught* how to write, who read *very* sparingly the works
of
other poets, and who formed almost no critical responses to the little
work
they did read. This, while it was the norm, was not absolute across the
board. There *were* students there who had (as Clayton Eshleman has
suggested as necessary) "broken their heads" against the works of
challenging writers. This persistence is of course what will direct
poetry,
I think. Just the pure ornery desire to get into poetics we don't
immediately "understand," poetics that capture our imagination and
challenge our ideas of what poetry is.

But it isn't a process that needs necessarily be absent from writing
programs. My professors (especially one in undergrad & one in grad
school)
were excellent directors--and one has to be motivated enough to go
looking
for one's self. Certainly anthologies like _Millennium_ are GREAT
resources
for people who pursue their knowledge for themselves (like Chris Roess).

(p.s. to Chris: Clayton has a wonderful book about the vocation of
poetry
called _Novices_)

The concept of certain schools being important sort of seems to come
after
the fact, in that way that history retroactively narrativizes what it
assumes happened purposefully. Some schools may come to be a locus for
lots
of activity, but in fact it's the *people* who make the difference.

Anthropocentricism is dangerous. It leads to the belief that there are no
other intelligent, competing, species out there in the universe. It leads to
the belief that life on planet Earth is safe harboured from those competing
species, and only a danger to itself, mostly by means of war and ecological
disasters.
Nothing could ultimately be further from the truth. As humankind probes
further from home planet, the dangers increase, and the sophistication of
potentially competitive species also increases. There is nothing to
guarantee that such species will be peaceful, except our own wishful science
fiction. A science fiction that is in its search for lost father figures in
outer space and perhaps lost divinities, which amounts to much the same
thing in strictly Freudian terms. We must realize that a more intelligent
species might in fact be a more violently competitive species despite its
intelligence.

We have seen how war changed on Earth as human intelligence grew. We have
seen the willingness to use weapons of mass destruction, by increasingly
educated, enlightened beings. We have no reason to believe that an alien,
perhaps more intelligent, space traveling, species would not be equally, or
more, aggressive in its territorial claims and its efforts at ascendancy
than is the human species. In fact we must expect that another species might
be more extreme than our own has proven itself to be. If we are disappointed
in that grimmest of expectations, then nothing is lost in preparing for the
worst.

If there is failure to expect that scenario of violently competitive alien
species, endangering human survival, then the result might be the grimmest
of all....the most horrible kind of extinction imaginable to our own. So it
becomes a matter of survival of the species to be prepared for other worldly
threats to human existence. Perhaps that is the ultimate prisoners' dilemma,
where the various human factions who keep each other locked into threats of
mortal combat, necessarily must join together to prepare a defence against
an unknown other worldly adversary. The ultimate battle then is not one of
man against man, but is in fact one of man against a hostile alien threat,
that remains essentially undefinable unless our mythologies include some
vague indications of previous contact. They might. We do not really know the
answer. The demons and the angels might well be two non human species who
battled amongst themselves, and whose violence against each other touched
upon this world in ancient times. Perhaps a few of their ships reached this
part of the universe, and the one was more convincing than the other to our
ancient ancestors. So they looked on one side in that conflict as good and
the other as evil, forgetting that in every war the one side inevitably
calls the other side evil. Such wild speculations aside, as perhaps too far
fetched, the chance of hostile, technically advanced, highly intelligent,
and extremely competitive, species, with beliefs far divergent from our own,
out there, somewhere in _our_ universe, is not only extremely high, but
completely certain. They are out there,......somewhere.....waiting for their
next challenge....

That being incorrect, due to the assumption that all events are vectored
positively, forwards, along the time axis. Those clocks never run in
reverse. That is in essence what makes them wrong. Time's arrow, its vector,
is in fact, at best "bent", and sometimes vectored in the opposite
direction, depending on what kinds of events we are discussing. Let us refer
to events that are vectored negatively along the time line as vectored T,
and events that are positively vectored along the time line as vectored t.
Those are the common designations for the negative and positive sides of the
time axis.

In fact it is my firm belief that a field, can be technically generated,
that is vectored to Tx, around an object that is itself vectored along t,
such that that object is carried by that field, at a mathematically infinite
velocity, towards Tx, which is a value along the T axis. In other words that
tachyonic fields generated around primarily tardyonic objects, can be the
basis of vessels capable of "time travel", from the present into the past.
Traversing vast distances in space, as well as traversing time towards what
we see as being the past, is the expected outcome. It is likely that
electromagnetic forces could be arranged in such a manner that the tachyonic
field would not disrupt the essentially tardyonic matter of the ship and its
crew. Therefore, I claim that manned time travel ships could become a
reality in the not very distant future. In fact our ships, which will travel
to the distant places in the universe, will essentially be time travel
ships, propelled by tachyonic fields.

This is my first posting to the list-- though I've been following for
the last week or so since signing on.

I'd like to respond to Todd Baron, since I am an M.F.A. graduate of one
of the programs he mentions, Naropa.

Naropa's program is actually a mix of both creative writing & poetics,
with more of an emphasis on creative writing.  That said-- there were
certainly lit-related seminars, as well as (in my own experience)
discussions of poetics in the actual workshops.  Naropa's program is
loosely structured in terms of content.  What does or does not get
taught may depend on the interests of faculty: there are no courses on
"Basic Texts," for example.  As a result, I think more leeway exists at
Naropa for students to pursue individual poetics interests, & many do,
with greater academic freedom than may exist even in a program like New
College's.

However I'd like to bring up another point-- to disagree w/ Todd to a
degree, based on my own experience.  While Naropa, as I say, had a
definite impact on me, I'd like to suggest that in my case &, I think,
the case of people I know personally, what one gets from such a program
(Naropa or New College) has much to do with the amount of responsibility
taken by the individual for her/his education as a poet.  & Such
education is not just a matter of what one studied in that context (we
all continue to read & grow in our practice, one hopes).  Which probably
doesn't contradict what Todd said at all, but which broadens the
question of what affected anyone's poetics to, at least, a larger nexus
than just such a program.

Dear Mark:

No contradiction here: but perhaps I was not clear--my investigation
reacts to a braoder question--persoanlly then--How do you think YOUR
education as a Poet in a poetics dept. at a college has affected yr
work. How do you think it affects a "school" of thought as a school of
Poetics. NARAPA had a rep. for being based more on a spiritual
investigation of poetcs--years ago--than a Comp. Lit study. Does that
affect yr poetics--

Why Naropa--for you--rather than somewhere else.

Thanks --every answer engages me!

True Story of Inheritance


Katagawa Jinko died and Nikuko was put in charge of his manuscripts. She
remembers seeing a list of four men, and his name was the first. It was an
odd name and she had problems reading it. The kanji were dusty and almost
embedded in the wood; everything was close to disappearing, like wood sha-
vings hardly holding their own. She smiled and thought, now I am in charge
of the manuscripts.

She made a true or false answer to a question about one of the manuscripts
- is this a manuscript of Katagawa Jinko - there were three answers, none
of them were yes or no. I was quite upset. You're fooling around with this
famous author's manuscripts, I said; they'll be dispersed. Don't you have
any sympathy at all for the dead. She was contrite in fact at this, and
stopped dragging the kanji behind her in furrows marked almost by a sight
of miniature valleys left by looping trails in the dust, close to unread-
able, and close to disappearing. She'd hold onto the revelation, not
thinking further about it. It was enough; there were clouds of dust in the
sky, a sense of grit, wood-shavings, the kanji worn and chipped. It was
enough that she'd keep them, stop with the multiple-choice giveaways of
Katagawa Jinko's work.

My understanding is that Ojai has been a "new age" center since at least World
War I (which makes it New Age avant le lettre) and that must mean that it's
orientation must have been focused around the spiritual fads of its time --
Blavatsky, Krishnamurti, Edgar Casey (whose name I'm certain I've just
misspelled).

I've always taken that comment of Olson's to be a sly dig at Robert Duncan who
was raised in (and never strayed that far from in later life either) in
theosophical tradition, a little payback for "Against Wisdom as Such."

B'rer Bromige, can you add additional insight?

i'm curious about the first eliot problem.  who controls the estate.  is
there any reason beside avarice that the cost of permissions is so high,
i.e. is the prohibitiveness of the cost intended to be just that,
prohibitive? if so, why?  is there a subtext here and if so what is it?
does anyone know?  and thanks, ron, for linking stein and faulkner in terms
of investigating the sentence.  useful.

The usual suspects, thank you, Louie: Raskalnikov, the odd flash
of recognition in Turgenev's painstakingly drawn but strangely
interchangable heros; Apollon Apollonovich and son in Bely's
_Petersberg_, a work similar to (though less ambitious than)
_Ulysses_. I wonder why the answers have clustered so far around
the 19th century, with the odd excursion into Joyceian territory?

Oh, and of course -- George Eliot's Dorothea.

Well, the New Yorker's business is selling the hip -- look
at the odd selections they make in the club listings, and
the even stranger (and condescending) comments that accompany.
The hip people need to explain, in that zen master mode of
impenetrable correctness, the Way Things Are.

Oh, yes; wonderful memories of that. A clunking radiator in
a New Hampshire blizzard... I forget the exact circumstances,
but it was a garbled version closer to Fourier than Marx...
something about "heaven after the conflaguration", which all
seems vaguely protosomethingdisturbing in retrospect.

So I went & read all the way through Richard & Peter's Introduction. Aside
from the fact that they didnt really PUSH the centre/margin trope all that
hard, assuming it, yes, because such tropes of exclusion/inclusion seem
unavoidable in such arguments, but really, getting down to pointing out how
the engines of commercial publishing & 'high art' have worked very hard
indeed to ignore a whole bun ch of writers in GB whose work, as a result,
has remained un-, or only semi-, known to many who might otherwise have
disovered it & been excited by it years ago. From what little I've read of
some of the poets they include (& some of those they say they were forced
to leave out), I expect to be terrifically excited by the work of those I
havent read. I'm really looking forward to the anthology -- which, like
Poems for the Millennium, will be "of use" in that it will provide some
open doors to work that fofr many of us just isnt available, or at least
not that easily found...

Subject:      Re: Other introductions

I wonder if a main source of spatial imagery in poetics
is due to the fact that many anthologists hope (and many
readers expect, as withness the Eliot thread) that their
collection represents some sort of omnibus edition of the
time. So, before they can work their readers up to more
"advanced" topics that involve the more neglected Modernists/
Postmoderns/[insert favourite maligned movement here],
they have to trudge through The.Waste.Land just one more
time. The periphery is quite literally periphery, filling
the end of the chapter or slipping in between the alphabetic
gaps left after taking out the E's and P's, a scattershot
choice of authors as random, sometimes, as the colonial
division of the Dark Continents. Having a "woman's section"
or other such grouping only seems to make it worse.

From the OED:

   anthology ænþo(hook).lod3i. [ad. L. anthologia, a. Gr. anqologia (f.
   anqo-j flower + -logia collection, f. leg-ein to gather), applied to a
   collection of poems. Cf. mod.Fr. anthologie. Later Gr. had also the
   homonym anqologion applied to a hymnal. ]

the center/margin descriptions come into anthology intros because anthologies
usually try to be "representative" of something in a larger literary field.
being "representative" is like one of the apologia for existing in the form
in which it exists.  But is this necessary?  I could imagine an anthology
that leaves the literary history to the critics & reviewers, and concentrates
on the aesthetic dynamics of the various poets included.  No apologies,
no frames.  this is probably sort of an artificial ideal but ideals come
in handy sometimes.  a problem with it is that anthology-makers are usually
guided as much by political & lit-history motivations as by anything else.
and people always want frames - it's like a raison d'etre - if you don't
have frames, they will question the logic of your selection. - Henry Gould

Stupidly I loaned my copy of The Collected Prose of Charles Olson (Univ of
California Press 1997) to someone undeserving of it, but that's the place
to start for the explications of this passage from "Against Wisdom as
Such."  Donald Allen and Benjamin Friedlander who edited the book have such
wonderful notes I'd be surprised if all is not explained therein.  And so I
don't remember, though they will, what is the reference to the "Ecole des
Sages or Mages" (what French group Olson's speaking of).  He must have been
writing in 1952 or 1953 and at that time Ojai was the center, as it still
is, of the US Theosophist movement, and Krishnamurti lived there, and Olson
is here deriding the propensity of the intellectuals who flocked round the
big K (Huxley, Isherwood, Heard, etc) to lose their sense of balance when
confronted with K's holy wisdom.  Olson's reading of San Francisco as a
kind of Ojai North was of course a challenge to Duncan, a fruitful one it
seems to me, tho Duncan admitted nothing and apologized for nothing, but
went on to flaunt his own mysticism in ways greater and grander than
anything he had done before.  ("The Opening of the Field" can be read as
Duncan's answer to Olson's charges in "Against Wisdom as Such."  I think
parts of Spicer's "Language" are also written with this essay in mind.)

I remember first coming here to California when I was a boy and going first
straight to Santa Monica to pay homage to Isherwood and then to Ojai to see
Krishnamurti.  I was so high I'm surprised I didn't tumble off a cliff, or
perhaps I did--like Madeleine, or Judy, in "Vertigo."

Yes to all that, dear Kevin. And add this: Ojai means "nest" in Spanish and
when you drive into the valley from the back way the view is breathtaking.
Capra added to its mythology by using it as the backdrop for Shangri-La in
"Lost Horizon." I once knew a belly dancer there, but this is hardly the
place to go into all that...

Thanks to all for the very generous response here and backchannel!
Not so coincidentally came across this exact quotation in POET BE
LIKE GOD: JACK SPICER AND THE SAN FRANCISCO RENAISSANCE
last night (the query had been prompted by my reading the Olson) -

        which is a good chance, anyway, for me to plug the book
        'testimonial-style': rec'd it friday, and it's just dreamy! now
        everyone go buy it from the nice man at Bridge St. Books...
        and congrats to KK, who as usual does not disappoint
        (even though he was such a 'degenerate' youth!).

                        c h r i s

p.s., if anyone cares to visit, the URL for The Ojai Foundation is
<http://www.ojaifoundation.org/>; there's a tiny 'history' section
that corroborates what's been sed on-list.

Up to a point. I blame the friend of mine who first lent me "Lightness"
(she kept a bowler hat beside her bed...)

Kundera did help me come to terms with a world where desire is transient,
problematic, mediated yet undeniable. Other writers, such as Valentine de
Saint-Point, Kapka Kassabova, Ian Wedde and Annemarie Jagose are helping me
to understand desire/lust/longing/whatever in all its forms and
deformations:


"Lust is the panic shudder of a particle of the earth"

        - V de S-P

"May you never recover
from the lightness of my touch"

        - K K

"ardent, headachy, Parnassian"

        - I W

"What is lust's question? What could be less simple than a question of
lust?"

        - A J


It's impossible to write a love poem without questioning the self.

ample space required for _the_  environmental experiment. Unfortunately
Zola, Prudhomme, and Coppee could not make up their mind what the _the_
was and so blamed Karl for the whole project. Karl got his revenge in
1883(?) with _Dichter charakter_ by anthologizing some mediocre work of
theirs and making it look like Arno Holz was the only worthwhile German
poet of the bunch. Holz got angry with Karl and created a poetics and
subsequent book called _Sekundenstil_  with miniture movements through
the prose transitioning from a non-existent meter into a stiffer
metrical sound st the end of the book. The joke being that Karl was
extremely slow to get an erection, the lack of formal devices implying
Karls lack of affluency. Then of course the style caught on sans joke to

currently rests with Robert Bly. (see Rupperrecht: Literarische

Valerie Eliot and Faber and faber control the estate, and play it very close
to the chest -- very hard if not impossible to get into the archives to see
what's what, for instance.

As for avarice, well. Historically, in the US at any rate the anthologising
rule was something like (this is way back in the 50s and 60s you realise)
Harcourt Brace would permit a poem to be anthologised provided a) the poem
appeared in a max of four anthologies at any one tiome, and b) the anthology
iteslf sold for more that $4.50. There was also some other rule about
paperbacks, I believe. (All this, you'll realize but not  of course
remember) when paperbacks were 25 or 35 cents (depending on size), Modern
Library books what, $1.45 hardcover, Modern Library Giants $2.45; new fancy
trade hardcovers $3.50 to $4.95 max. But you managed (I managed) as a
visiting grad student in St Louis to live on a little less than $900 for a
year (1955-6). Cornell offered TA-ships in English at $1100, out of which
you paid your fees.

Anthologies were big business in those days (Understanding Poetry, I was
once told, made its editors around a million each). Maybe they still are,
but exceptionally not usually I'd say.

Avarice? I dunno. Control, yes.

One might note though (I think Jerry Rothenberg knows this more than I do)
that literary estates are notorious for their dreams of wealth: one
anthology I know of had to exclude Marianne Moore because the fee for two
poems was MORE than the budget for all 800 or so pages of poetry in the
book;  cost of printing Zukofsky is, I'm told, $10.00 per line. Eliot? I
have no idea, but if the fee is by the line, then The Waste Land would be
pretty hefty, no?

Some anthologists, as a result, simply shove the poems in and hope the
estate doesn't notice. In these litigious days that's extremely risky and
can be cripplingly expensive (witness the Salinger bio some years back).

I think that dealing with the Eliot estate has been problematic. While
Eliot was alive, they did not allow his works to be published in paperback
anthologies. And I think there had been a resistance for years in putting
his books in paerback format. I think, with the drop off in interest in his
work, they've been repackaging the books, etc.  The high cost of
permissions is the reality is that where the estate makes its money (part
of the reason that HarperCollins signed up Ginsberg was to get at a chunk
of the permission fees).

These high fees are common to poets who are published by commercial and
university presses. I discovered this when i did an anthology of NJ poets
for rutgers university press. Unfortunatley, commercial houses have a hard
time discerning between a regional anthology that sells a few thousand
copies v. a college textbook-type anthology that sells 100's of thousands
and are actual money-makers for the editors.

President and Mrs. Clinton to Welcome
Poets Laureate for Millennium Evening at the White House

Transcript of Millennium Evening with Poets Laureate

The President and Mrs. Clinton have announced that the next Millennium
                  Evening will be a celebration of American creativity
through poetry
                featuring Poets Laureate Robert Pinsky, Robert Hass and
Rita Dove and
                will take place in the East Room of the White House on
Wednesday, April
                   22 at 7:30 p.m. The Poets Laureate, along with President
and Mrs.
                Clinton and members of the audience, will read poems they
have selected
                      as particularly illustrative of the American voice in
poetry.

                  Millennium Evenings at the White House are a series of
lectures and
               cultural showcases that highlight creativity and
inventiveness through our
                  ideas, art and scientific discoveries. The lectures
present prominent
                  scholars, creators and visionaries and are accessible to
the public via
                                     broadcast and cybercast.

                The President and Mrs. Clinton encourage the public to
participate in the
               evening's discussion by e-mailing questions for the three
poets laureate or
                  sending a favorite poem with comments, either before or
during the
                cybercast. These may be sent via the White House Web Site
several days
                 before the event. The Website will also post satellite
coordinates (on C
                   and KU bands) and serve as a link to the cybercast. It
will also be
                          available via the Web page of Sun Microsystems.

                 Robert Pinsky is the current Poet Laureate Consultant in
Poetry at the
                   Library of Congress. He is focusing his work on the
Favorite Poem
                   Project. In commemoration of the millennium, one to two
thousand
                Americans, from every state, with varying regional accents,
ages, levels of
                education, professions and ethnicities will recite their
favorite poems for
                  an audio/video archive. In addition to a long career in
teaching, most
                  recently at Boston University, Professor Pinsky has
served as poetry
                  editor of The New Republic. He is currently the poetry
editor of the
                                     on-line magazine Slate.

                   Robert Hass is Professor of English at the University of
California,
                Berkeley, and served as Poet Laureate Consultant in Poetry
from 1995 to
                1997. During his tenure, Professor Hass battled illiteracy

The amazing thing is that the Millennium Evenings are actually cyborg
virtual "forecasts" from the previous Millennium (a.d. 1000) - the

NYT - July 14, 1998

A Louder Voice for Poetry

By HOLLAND COTTER

America is a nation of poets; New York is a city of poets. But it often
seems that only poets themselves are aware of the fact. Audiences for their
work are small, financial rewards meager, opportunities to appear in
prominent public forums few.

This situation seems to be changing. Competitive poetry readings known as
slams have gained an ardent following, and the National Slam, a four-day
world championship of poetry, will kick off on Aug. 18 in Austin, Tex.; a
1998 documentary titled "Slam Nation" will open at Film Forum on Friday.;
literary bands are flourishing in rock clubs, and poetry has blossomed on
the Internet, a medium that eliminates the customary publication hierarchies
and gives everyone a say.

But writing poetry as a full-time pursuit, as the thing you do, is still a
pioneer's art. There are no shortcuts, no guarantees; resilience and
self-reliance are crucial career qualifications.

This has always been true. More than a century ago, Walt Whitman paid a
Brooklyn print shop to run off the first edition of his too-hot-to-handle
"Leaves of Grass" and distributed and promoted the book himself. Emily
Dickinson stitched her handwritten poems into little packets -- each, in
effect, a self-published book -- to store away in her New England bedroom
for future eyes to find.

Self-publishing enjoyed a real florescence in our own century. Beginning in
the 1950's and early 60's, a new poetry outside the academic mainstream was
on the rise. It was encouraged by advances in duplicating technology --
mimeographing, offset printing, photocopying -- that made it possible for
writers to produce magazines and books cheaply and virtually overnight while
having control over contents and circulation.

"A Secret Location on the Lower East Side: Adventures in Writing,
1960-1980," at the New York Public Library at Fifth Avenue at 42d Street
through July 25, documents this rich, four-decade-long indie phenomenon in
American literature, often called the "mimeograph revolution."

Organized by Rodney Phillips and Steven E. Clay and drawn mostly from the
library's collection, the show encompasses some 400 publications, from
quick-and-dirty pamphlets to elegantly designed books. (About half the
material, in fact, isn't mimeographed.) Some of the best known artists of
the era contributed cover art.

A few of the journals are still appearing; most are long gone. And in a
sense, it is their ephemerality and their underground origins (the show's
title is borrowed from the poet Edward Sanders's account of producing a
dissident magazine in his New York apartment) that makes them historically
important. As the show's rows upon rows of vitrines reveal, these fragile
publications were not so much literary monuments as records of dynamic ideas
and personalities passing through a particular time and place.

Although the United States was in tamped-down cold war mode in the 1950's,
countercultural energy was stirring. Experimental poetry was an outlet for
this ferment, and early on, the avant-garde tended to separate into
movements along lines of style, locale and dominant personalities, all of
which were defined by Donald Allen's groundbreaking 1960 anthology, "The New
American Poetry, 1945-1960."

Charles Olson and Robert Creeley, for example, presided over an influential
group of writers at Black Mountain College in North Carolina. Robert Duncan
was a central figure in a San Francisco renaissance. The poet Frank O'Hara
was the lodestar for a so-called New York School. And Allen Ginsberg turned
beat poetry into a galvanic force from coast to coast.

Wildly Varied Work Is Brought Together

The work that resulted was wildly varied, but it staked out new esthetic
terrain. It brought popular culture, non-Western thought and countercultural
politics together in a language that mixed the rhythms of common speech and
the improvisatory flair of jazz. And each group generated a multitude of
journals and small press books, often created by hand and on the fly.

One of the first entries in the show suggests the flavor of much of what
follows. It is a smudgy, much-handled copy of a poem by Ginsberg titled
"Siesta in Xbalba." Ginsberg wrote the piece in Mexico in 1954 but published
it himself two years later as a 12-page booklet that he mimeographed aboard
a cargo ship in the Bering Sea. He gave friends almost the entire edition,
52 hand-stapled copies.

Just a year earlier, the writer had made literary history when he read his
explosively anarchic "Howl" in San Francisco. (A first edition of another of
his beat anthems, "Kaddish," published by City Lights Books, is one of the
show's iconic objects.) And around the same time, extraordinary things were
starting to brew in New York.

Like everything about the city, the poetry was wildly pluralistic, though
social circles and trends overlapped. The beat presence was evident in
magazines like Yugen, founded in 1958 by the poet and playwright LeRoi Jones
(who changed his name to Imamu Amiri Baraka). A little later came the highly
polished Art and Literature, edited by John Ashbery and devoted to the work
of the New York School poets. And both groups appeared in the mimeographed
magazine Kulchur, which had both O'Hara and Baraka on its editorial board.

All these journals figure in the show, but the real focus falls on
publications associated with a second generation of New York School poets
who settled on the Lower East Side around 1960. At that point mimeographed
publications really began to proliferate. Among the most adventurous of them
was C: A Journal of Poetry, founded by Ted Berrigan, who had come to New
York from Tulsa, Okla., along with the poet Ron Padgett and the artist Joe
Brainard.

The Word and Art Helping Each Other

Berrigan had learned to use mimeograph machines in the Army during the
Korean War, and he turned C into an exceptional product. Not only was it
packed with some of the best writers around, but also it was almost as
engaging to look at as it was to read, thanks both to Brainard, who is one
of the visual heroes of the exhibition, and to the range of artists whom
Berrigan asked to contribute work.

Indeed, the interplay of literature and art was a hallmark of the period.
Poets like Ashbery, Bill Berkson and Peter Schjeldahl were also art critics.
Tibor de Nagy Gallery, among others, routinely published poetry (and has
recently begun to do so again). Work by painters like Philip Guston, Alex
Katz, Brice Marden, and Andy Warhol crop up on book and magazines covers
throughout the show. (Reva Wolf's 1997 book "Andy Warhol, Poetry and Gossip
in the 1960's" gives a fascinating glimpse, by the way, into these
relationships.)

The exhibition also make good use of other visual material -- snapshots,
paintings, videos -- to evoke the tightly networked social communities from
which these publications emerged. The Aquarian Age of psychedelic drugs,
Vietnam and sexual liberation was itself, of course, a binding force. But so
were the collaborative activities that any shoestring literary scene
generates: readings and meetings and workshops, all-night printing and
collating parties, the passing of fresh images from hand to hand.

By 1966, much of the action centered on the utopian institution known as the
Poetry Project, established that year at St. Marks-in-the-Bowery Church in
the East Village. Some gorgeous publications -- notably Angel Hair, edited
by Anne Waldman and Lewis Warsh -- had their origins there. So did the
Poetry Project Newsletter, which was started by Ron Padgett in 1972 (a copy
of the first issue is on display) and remains an invaluable source of
information on poetry, both in New York and beyond.

The show also succeeds in giving a sense of the sheer variety of fringe
publications that appeared. Designs range from the minimalist look of
journals devoted to Concrete poetry and Language writing edited by Aram
Saroyan, Clark Coolidge, Ron Silliman, Charles Bernstein and Bernadette
Mayer, to the surrealist flair of the cult magazine Semina, created by the
West Coast assemblagist Wallace Berman. (The magazine, which was distributed
through the mail, was never for sale; its proto-hippie motto was "Art is
love is God.")

An Early Bulwark of Multiculturalism

And for evidence that multiculturalism was firmly in place many decades
before the 1990's, one need look no further than journals that bring issues
of race and sexuality to the fore. Some, like Umbra, focused on black
American culture. Others, like Poems From the Floating World, edited by
Jerome Rothenberg, mixed Chinese, Arabic and American Indian work. And gay
voices found a place, from collaborations between Robert Duncan and his
lover, the collagist Jess Collins in the 1950's, to the stylish New Wave
Little Caesar, edited by Dennis Cooper in Los Angeles in the 70's.

In the late 1970's and 80's, a third generation of New York School poets
emerged, and with it publications reflecting new impulses and styles,
including neo-punk rock. Some of the magazines, like the short-lived but
lively Dodgems, created by the poet Eileen Myles, who has been called "the
last of the New York School poets," were nonmimeo in format. And by the late
80's, desktop publishing had rendered such old production modes all but
obsolete.

By the time the show draws to a close, just short of the advent of computer
technology, it has covered a huge amount of material and inevitably things
are left out.

An important and still-vibrant Lower East Side institution like the
Nuyorican Poets Cafe, which is based on oral poetry traditions, is given
scant mention. The same is true of the wide range of theater and performance
art that has always been an integral part of the poetry world. (Such work is
increasingly available on homemade videos and audio tapes, yet another
alternative publishing medium for poetry.)

Even with some omissions, the ground that has been covered is vast. And it
is great to know that the painstaking exercise in historical research that
the show represents will have an afterlife in the form of a catalogue to be
published jointly by the library and Granary Books in October.

Of course, no book or lineup of display cases can convey the exhilarating
charge of live poetry, hot off the press or spoken out loud. And this raises
again the question of the future of this seemingly vulnerable, transitory
art. Will it find new venues? (Surely the still-forming gallery neighborhood
in Chelsea is tailor-made for reforging the link between art and poetry.) Or
will it be swamped and made ever smaller by a media-saturated information
age?

Eileen Myles, who has lived and written in the East Village for 25 years, is
encouraged. "Poetry is always radical," she says. "It's pure democracy. You
can't limit it to a one-minute MTV slot. You can't confine it to bytes. It's
an art about time and about expansiveness, the open road. Young people now
in their 20's now are hungry for that. And we're in there with them."

John Tranter:

There's nothing wrong with you (that a little change of citizenship
wouldn't cure).  Your problem is, you aren't a USAmerican...

i will try to explain it for you.  In the U.S. the labor movement (and
therefore most forms of left struggle, and therefore dissident and
original thought in general) were defeated/kept in check/bought off, a
long time ago.  Also, factor number two, the US ruling class and its power
structures have been made into world-cop overlords (the american century
etc.) via a series of economic and geopol developments.

The concatenation of these things means:  1. a stunning lack of critical
edge in public discourse, particularly among those who have the capial and
the social position to really set the tone; and 2. what amounts to a
monarchical/dictatorial system, often refered to as the Imperial
Presidency.  The president can be checked on occasion by the Congress (cf.
Nixon)  but that body is controlled by a single governmental machine (the
Republicrat structure, which called "two political parties" but isn't even
one, since it is not based on mass membership) that has no real
differences of interest from the prez.  So *anything* whether it involves
poets or ballplayers or school teachers for idaho or army veterans or
whatever, that involves the casa blanca is treated as a religious event,
comperable in weepy magnificence to a Norman Rockwell canvas...

Of course, tho' i guess they have their moments once in a while, the
"laureates" are (like most of their compeers) quite bad and quite
uninteresting as poets, most of the time.  It's their sort you often find
kickin' up their heels with caeser, isn't it?  and not just in "the good
ol' USA!!"

Todd,

Re: Naropa as "spiritual": yes, in a loose sense, this is true of
Waldman, Schelling, Bye.  Not so (in any way that intersects w/ their
teaching or writing, at least) of Hollo or Hawkins, or of the majority
of visiting writers, or of the majority of students I've known
personally.  &, Unlike other programs @ Naropa, there are no
Buddhist-related requirements (such as meditation) for students in the
M.F.A. writing & poetics program.

As to how it has affected my own poetics-- the emphasis on poetics as
not just a genre of comp lit but as the engagement of a fellow
practitioner WITH a body of writing, certainly would be one point.  In
terms of "schools," what's had more of an affect, possibly, would be
schools in the non-academic sense (tho' I was never "there")-- e.g. NY
school & Language "moment."  Certainly the distrust of intellectualism,
on the one hand, & intellectual immersion, on the other, characteristic
of these two groups, has framed (sometimes ironically) my own sense of
engagement in the essays I've written.  As for the poetry, I'd like to
think I'm independent enough not to have been wholly shaped by any of
the above.  Certainly, a sense of improvisation, arrangement, pushing at
the edges, trying not to repeat myself, has played a role.  Certainly
some of these are "Naropa values"-- but I think, for better or worse,
I'm not very typical of the poets (student poets?) Naropa has
"produced."

By the way, could you elaborate on how "the study of Olson, The
Romantics, Oppen, Dickinson, Basic Texts (Aristotle, etc), Whitman and
the texts that influenced their poetics has affected [your] work as a
poet?"....

Anyways--the study of those mentioned has affected my work as a poet in
various sense

1) the poem as possible dialogue with epic--as history--as
     a sense so much more interesting than "self"
2) Dickinson--and my study with Rbert Duncan and Arron Shurin--has
affected my idea of what the poem is--that Robert said "Trust the poem"
never the poet..per se--and that Emily Dickinson was an Occult Poet--and
that Robert said "All poetry is an occult scinece"
3) Reading in Basic Texts--and studying--knowing whre  the work comes
from--the true history of the language--as Spicer said--paraphrased-in
order to have Rabbit stew you gotta "catch the rabbit" first!
4) Whitman gave me the idea of what the poem is for me--a poem that has
everything to do with the Outisde world as repeated represented on my
Inside--the line--the LINE--as the foundation of the poem--what a poem
is anways--to look at--is lines--and the rejection of the then current
line strangulation in sonnett/neat/form.

Though my work is nothing like the above writers--I read them all the
time--I learned to READ in Grad. school. I learned to read in 3rd grade!

Your discussion of Naropa is interesting. I've wanted to see what the
possible connected between New College Poetics and Naropa is--but I
still see a different take--there--as there--was a long time ago at
Naropa-- David Meltzer and Diane DiPrima most likely the poets I studied
with that have a Naropa Connection. Imagine the joy of studying Kabbalah
and The Roamtics with these two--and though my work as a poet doesn't
directly engage(as you said yr studies don't) those "subjects"--the
constant drive towards a given mystery--I believe that's what seperates
the current "academic" departments of Creative Writing programs from
those such as Naropa--and even SFSU--and New C.

I was searching through the Barnes & Noble website earlier today. Here's some of the titles listed under "Literature, Theory & Criticism" BESTSELLERS (updated weekly). See if you can guess what they have in common.

 It's a no-brainer on most of these, although some I'm puzzled by.Lots of- Cliff Notes- selling because of the Required Summer Reading Lists at Schools. If you are wondering why Dumas's _Man in the Iron Mask_ and Tobias Wolff's memoir_This Boy's Life_ are on the bestseller list, well you've already forgotten that Leonardo DiCaprio starred in both of these movies (neither very recently, either).We can't underestimate teenagers (mostly young women I'd imagine) and their influence.

Todd,
I don't know about affects exactly but you know Cal-Arts now has a Critical
Studies program where the kids write. My sister Carol T. graduated last year
in the new dept's first class. Her thesis was a novel, but they did seem to
do more critical work than I did at San Fran State. I was a bit jealous of
that. Seems like it at least gives more to talk about than each other's work
and outfits. Sat in on a class of hers with John Wagner which was
great--they were talking about Rumi and a million things --criticism,
critical thought--i may not be the best at it but it gets me going when it
doesnt bore.  its kind of like landscaping that way. or wallpaper.
The program is headed by Dick Hebdige, of Semiotexte in-fame. They publish
Errant Bodies. excuse me if this is all old news.

Billy,

yes LKJ is super, but the real way to experience him is with the dub band.
i think most of his albums are available on cd now. he's on shanachie
records.

Yes--the dept. ..The thing there that "bothers" me though is the
abolsute lack (here my ego goes) of those students participating in the
very small lit. scene in LA. I fear they feel they are outside of the
various and sometimes good readings and publications. I've yet to run
into a Cal-Arts strudents that read cont. poetry or goes to the readings
at Sun and Moon. While in SF I went to everything! I hear from Noah D.
Lissovoy that he runs into SFSU students at everything now that he lives
"up there". And so--I'm afraid now that Cal-Arts and other "critical
studies" dept.s actually create a border--not a moving one--but a solid
firm one. I wonder if this is al my own bullshirt or if I'm right!

Living in LA is horribiliy political. Few readings scarecly attended!

Any responses to Margy Sloan's MOVING BORDERS ANTHOLOGY--since we've
talked of the damned Millenium--which never seems to come? I believe
THIS is the anthology that I want to reread and that matters. If for
nothing else but Margy's immense intro and Neidecker's amazing "lots"
poem that opens the text.  THis is a GREAT text!

To pick back up the Barrett Watten discussion --

"A sterile madness lives in pictures of highly controlled effects--which is
what we mean when we speak of abstraction."

This sounds like Foucault, right? At the end of Bad History, there's a
section by section list of citations or readings, and sure enough, at the
end of the list for "No Man's Land" comes Foucault's Madness and
Civilization.

The footnotes here, what is their relationship to the text? Is the
dissociation and deletion of reference what's bad in a Bad History? Watten
quotes (someone quoting?) the line that a history without women's proper
names is a _bad history_. Is Watten quoting Foucault, or simulating him? At
any rate, I'm having a footnote experience David Jones only dreamed about.

Again, this is the cheapest sort of discussion about literature, nothing
about what Watten does so admirably in Bad History, but instead taking on a
sort of surplus issue, talking about the project and its presentation and
not the activity and its rates. Just to mumble in case the book'd been
skipped over --

Subject:      Money
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain

Some months ago, Don Byrd started one of his posts with this remark:

I have found the discussion of poetry and money  painful.  There have
been attitudes, of course, about MFA programs and about academics and
about the honor of not making money, etc.  But what is the issue?

What, indeed? One answer might be found in a wonderful book I've
recently discovered, _Frozen Desire_ by James Buchan. It's a book about
the history of money, but not only that. In the manner of R Gancie, let
me quote what seemed to me a truly remarkable paragraph from the
introduction:

"Yet I saw that money was a deep, almost unbreakable, social relation.
The banknote I gave the Lebanese waiter was not a simple object, whose
function could be deduced quite quickly, like a pencil or, once the
control knob has been found, a television. The engraved swirls and
signs, even the King's portrait, did not suddenly reveal the note's
purposes to someone who knew nothing of money. The banknote was an
outcrop of some vast mountain of social arrangements, . . . It occurred
to me that, in using money, I had submitted to the authority of a
society of which I knew little, but in which I found as much to deplore
as admire: subscribed, as it were, to the tottering triangles in the suq
that were women or the tense scamper after Friday prayers when we all
coralled into an open space downtown to witness a beheading. There was
something sacramental about my pay: that I'd offered up to some higher
organ my primary social relations, that it was to me and my friends as a
flag is to a regiment or a crucifix to Christians. I felt compelled. I
was not a volunteer of Saudi Arabia or any society: I had been pressed.
My wages came to me not to satisfy any need -- mine were anyway private,
affectionate, atrocious -- but to make my needs universal: to
incorporate me in the mainstream of men and things in which my work was
not for me but for everybody; and to take what was special in me, my
most secure and precious sense of myself, and make it general and banal.
In short, I was to be civilized."

He goes from this personal introduction to a more scholarly, yet
fascinating, history of money, interest and what might be called
"econo-metrics" -- a great read! I recommend it highly.

    John - this is part of the new 'journalism lite' that's "popular"
here in the U.S. (particularly light on "public discourse", as Mark
noted). This far out, I'm afraid it's more disheartening than
surprising to see vagaries such as this in the news media:

> During his tenure, Professor Hass battled illiteracy by putting into action
> his belief that, "Imagination makes communities."

foibles from today's edition of the local paper might include the
headline "Boys' Deaths Take the Bounce Out of Orange Marches",
or this masterpiece of critical reportage (which sounds like a
goddamn'd Pepsi commercial to me):

        "The vast Army range west of Tooele this month is staging unique war
        games that combine ground forces, Army helicopters and Air Force
        fighter jets, giving part-time warriors a more realistic taste of
        the front lines, complete with live ammunition. It is part of a
        nationwide training run dubbed Global Patriot '98.
                [...]
        Dugway was selected because of its wide-open airspace, not because
        it looks much like Korea."

or probably my favorite headline today: "Oxygen: Can't Live With It,
But Can't Live Without It". Really -- this is on the front page,
whereas such articles as

        Clinton Says No To Independence In Kosovo Region
        Russian Bailout Gets Approval Of World Bank

are buried deeeep inside. And of course that's not to mention the
terrific number of happenings not deemed newsworthy (e.g., any
left activity, any rightist activity or corruption on the part of
governmental agencies or local corporations that can't be
whitewashed...). I suppose mebbe it's worse here in UT than elsewhere
-- I get most of my news from a combination of Pacifica, the Times,
the Boston Globe (online), the Nation digital edition; local news
from very small independents, one of which is excellent on
local corruption issues...

Thanks, Joe.
Yes, I did notice that kerfuffle as it drifted across the screen some
months ago, but I hadn't actually seen how awful the original White House
guff was.
Twelve years ago August Kleinzahler told me Hass and Pinsky would engineer
something like this, and boy, he was right!
I have a poem I wrote about a brace of US poets not entirely unlike them
in, I think, 1986:

John Tranter

          On Looking Into The American Anthology

     1

In California a young man is stuffing a briefcase -
first a jug of light, the words 'water'
and 'stone', a blurred image of a guy in a pickup
          truck with a gun

staring through the hush-squeak, hush-squeak
of the wipers, a frail woman, crying. A leaf, a sob,
a clod of mud. There! His class awaits the real,
          the Deep and Meaningful.

Driving downtown he sees a pair of jugglers
inch up the face of a glass cathedral full of
marriages, mirrored in the noon glare, one on top,
          and then his double.

The neon signs in the suburbs full of graves say
'Giants Drank and Died Here'. Autos, rusting trucks,
police helicopters roam restlessly, their motto: Do it
          First, and do it Fast.

     2

Down here in New Zealand, jet-lagged in transit
at the bottom of the planet, a clutch of
Flight Attendants giggle in a corner: one gay,
          the others married.

The sun that has looked down on Hollywood,
on lust, Las Vegas and the will to power,
rises, rhododactylos, on Auckland Airport:
          through the tinted glass

a perfect field of fodder, five sheep,
a tractor nosing at the sedge, the shrill
cacophony of jets rehearsing like a madman
          staring at a vase.

Nothing the amusing natives do here matters
in the Capital. The giant engines lift us
through the sky. The next stop - Australia -
          is the end of the line.

"Then poet, if you mean to thrive,
Employ your muse on king's alive;
With prudence gathering up a cluster
Of all the virtues you can muster:
Which formed into a garland sweet,
Lay humbly at your monarch's feet;
Who, as the odours reach his throne,
Will smile, and think them all his own:
For law and gospel both determine
All virtues lodge in royal ermine.
(I mean the oracles of both
Who shall depose it upon oath.)
Your garland in the following reign,
Change but the names, will do again."

Contributors to Ric Caddel's and Peter Quartermain's "Other British Poetry"
anthology have been asked to comment on the introduction.

I wouldn't want to be nationalist about poetry (not even about poor little
Scotland, which gets short shrift here), but as far as an international
readership is concerned, Britain has been a difficult place to write from in
recent years.  That itself is a poetic topic of great importance for its
writers.

The introduction makes full allowance for the many "Englishes" which now
create a multi-cultural, multi-national sense of "British poetry".  So thank
god for this remarkable piece of entrepreneurship which, at last, will give
the US some idea of what's been going on.  Until recently, I've found most of
my many American friends almost entirely ignorant about the British scene.
I'm delighted if Billy Little responds so enthusiastically, for example.

Mostly, the introduction is excellent, although it will be cut down for the
actual edition.  However, there's hardly ever such a thing as a true overview
written from within a situation:  perhaps the point about the Donald Allen
anthology, which always gets cited as the example, is that Allen wasn't caught
up in the tensions he so ably categorised: he was just friendly with everyone.
Here, a slight North of England/London bias cannot be avoided in some of the
weightings: thus, both Ric and Peter Quartermain come forward from the Basil
Bunting direction and place great emphasis upon the London figures Eric
Mottram and Allen Fisher (as prime exemplars of new poetics), and Bob Cobbing
(as key figure in sound/performance based moves).  I don't object to editorial
bias -- don't see how it can be avoided.  As for unstated reasons they can't
include J.H. Prynne's work in the anthology itself, their generous attempt to
acknowledge the influence of Cambridge lacks some depth, not least because
their list of honourable exclusions includes many younger Prynne disciples.
(Prynne's increasingly difficult work can be read in the new "collected" due
out this summer.)

The introduction sees British poetry as an arena of gladiatorial battles, the
mainstream versus "The Other".  A key event, therefore, was the avant-garde's
seizure of control of the stuffy Poetry Society in the 1970s, before a
counter-coup returned the society and its centrist Poetry Review safely to the
mainstream.  This was a London event in which Cambridge took a much lesser
role: "If we're all struggling against officialising centrism, why are we
trying to get control of the official centre?" -- that was sometimes a
Cambridge thing to say.  But fair enough: Bob Cobbing and Eric Mottram led a
heroic tussle for a few years.  Let it be acknowledged.

When it comes to such battles the names of women disappear.  For such a
concentration tends to exclude from discussion those who are cagey about the
power relationships involved in all group movements and banner waving; that
includes not just many women but many writers from other ethnicities -- and, I
must say, myself (I'm rather anarchist about poetic movements) though my work
features in the collection, sure enough.  I am hopeful that the anthology will
actually prove sufficiently multi-cultural and have a proper gender balance,
for that is a different kind of battle not fully won in Britain yet.

For me, much of the talk about the Rothenberg/Joris assemblage missed the
point.  The point with anthologies is that someone has to get the whole
business started:  Jerry and Pierre have done this for world literature; now
Ric and Peter Quartermain have done it for recent British poetry as
anthologised in the US.

Salutations to all you out there who are genuinely waiting for the news!

*****************************************

Dear Poets Critics & Fellahin,

WE, Douglas Rothschild, & Tony Dohr, being of unsound judgment, come
now, after many hours spent in vigorous debate, requesting your
participation in a new THOUGHT project.


There has recently been a small controversy about negativism in critical
reviews, we have come to believe that the critic MUST express his or her
dissatisfaction with EVERY poem without fear of either sensor, damaged
feelings, or hurt friendships. In light of this revelation, we offer these
poems up for critical comment. Feel free to critique them, ignore them,
savage them or, to our enduring embarrassment, praise them. But please
remember that we firmly believe that the most sincere & useful response
to work is invariably: Glib, Critical, & Acerbic.


{The Poems} --typography is not always translatible across formats so the
poems are available in sep. file upon request.

Hey, you poets have got the flat disjunctive incomplete sentence down,
which is the main thing by which we experimentalists distinguish between
us and them & what poetry is.  The poem as something that started someplace
else in your head you've already forgotten and gets truncated in order to
remember that missing element.  Work a little more on the non-rhythm
the boredom the feeling of unexplained angst; learn to throw in some
plangent multisyllabic non-references from a fairly large dictionary;
work on your spatial distances between words and "lines" which are what
shows you are a thoughtful alternative poet patted on the head by major
people like Olson Creeley Duncan or genericnewyorkbeatlanguagepoet -
and they'll put you in an anthology of (Newer) Americans - (the 14th
one - from Urban Bleat Press).

Subject:      Re: Other introductions
MIME-version: 1.0
Content-type: TEXT/PLAIN; CHARSET=US-ASCII

I thank everyone who has repsonded thus far to my post on Caddell and
Quartermain's introduction.  I hope that the work of these editors will
pay off; when the anthology itself is available, we can congratulate them
again for getting it done in the first place.  Those who have not yet read
the introduction should not be mislead by my first post: the undertaking
of these two anthologists is immense and their knowledge of their subject
extensive (yet more spatial metaphors).

Mark and Michael's challenges to make my own anthology or write my own
introduction are the best initial response to a post such as mine, and if
I were to find that same post written by someone else I would want to make
the same challenge.

I agree with Mark that a "cognitive realignment" (can I get my tires
rotated and brake pads replaced at the same time?), one probably contigent
on our acquisition of different economic circumstances for the making and
trading of poems, is perhaps needed to enable us to tell some really
surprising stories.

I agree with Henry that ideally more anthologies with different organizational
logics, or at least logics less overtly loyal to our sociology of poetry,
would be a good thing, to the extent that anthologies matter to poetics.

Despite my initial gratitude to Caddell and Quartermain, I still do not
think my comments were unwarranted or "nitpicking."  For all of its merits,
ambition, and self-consciousness, the intro to Other British and Irish
Poetry is nonetheless part of a subgenre of prose poetics in our time--
namely the anthology intro-- and this one too uses a rhetoric of contemporaneity
characteristic of this subgenre.  This rhetoric can and should be read
critically from time to time, especially by those who have most to learn from
it, and even if it is borrowed from or shared with other poetics subgenres.

It is not so easy to criticize Caddell and Quartermain's introduction.
But I find that what are in my opinion some of its least persuasive
rhetorical moves are also stimulating me to think about poetics.  For example:

1)  The version that I have read either puts quotation marks around the word
"mainstream," or leaves them off, in a seemingly haphazard way.  Whether or
not it is intentional, this rhetorical feature is a significant way to
allude to/inscribe the provisional quality of a key word of this essay.
Its readers should ask themselves, what other ways might there be to
thematize or discursively announce doubt about the mainstream/marginal
opposition AS A RHETORICAL DEVICE?

2)  When these editors conclude of hypothetical readers of "mainstream"
poetry that their reading is a kind of "passive consumption," they assume
a lot about the act of reading without justifying their indictment.
Justifying it would be a worthwhile work of poetics for an introduction
to an anthology such as this one.

3)  I found the brief look at a "not unrepresentative" mainstream poem to
be a missed opportunity.  I did not really learn much from the discussion
of a mediocre poem by Hugo Williams (who?).  Why not for the purpose of
contrast use a poem by an expatriate poet perhaps more familiar to
readers this side of the Atlantic (if we are the primary audience for this
anthology?  For me anyway, more sparks would have flown from grinding
Thom Gunn or Paul Muldoon against a polemical stone.

All of this has started me thinking about the form of the anthology intro
in terms of Derrida's deconstruction of the preface in Dissemination.
What is the logical/epistemological/metaphysical status of the introduction
and of the names that repose within it?  What happens to narrative time when
an anthologist places something first that presumably was written last?
How does an intro's rhetoric of self-erasure (the intro must end somehow)
trace itself onto the anthologized poems?  It seems to me that these issues
are ones that the anthologist of experimental poetry, who perhaps cannot be
other than a prescient ur-reader of posthumous reading, might consider when
deploying recognizable rhetorical moves.

Caddell and Quartermain invite us to do more work.  I accept their invitation.

Gary R.

Dear Rachel Levitsky - please post that report about the dog bite -
inquiring minds want to know! _I_ happen to know who among the illustrious
did sit or nearly sit themselves in a pile of dog shit that terrorized the
commons all night under rocket's red glare, etc.

Meanwhile, back at the Fox Theater in Boulder, the All-Star Millennial
Vagabond Poet's Troupe was whispering in the wings of last Wednesday.
(Packed house. No air conditioning. Ghost of Allen Ginsberg presiding).
Steven Taylor began the evening on harmonium with Ginsberg's musical setting
of Blake's "On Another's Sorrow." Utterly lovely and haunting. Taylor then
read from a delightful series of travel diary poems written while on the
road with Ginsberg and Anne Waldman in Israel and Eastern Europe - "snapshot
poetics," he aptly called them. Brief, sharply etched tableaux both amusing
and poignant. The old master moving in blurred newsreel now. Taylor closed
with a fresh, wistful re-translation of Pound's version of Li Po's "The
River Merchant's Wife." "If you're coming down the canyon call ahead of time
and we will come out to meet you as far as the mailbox."

Joanne Kyger read next, starting with a long poem inspired by a visit to
Mexico.  Cleverly skirting the margins of cultural tourism, this work was
both lyrical paean to the history of the land and its peoples and a critique
of that history - witty, ironic and suffused with an underlying melancholy.
Following came a sly poem dedicated to Anselm Hollo - "The tree blossomed.
This is what happened." And she closed with a lush homage to Neruda, culled
in part from his own _Memoirs_. A tribute to the bard as vatic seer,
political activist and master of song.

David Henderson, author of Hendrix bio _Scuse Me While I Kiss The Sky_ and
editor of Bob Kaufman's _Cranial Guitar_, read next, beginning with work
from his forthcoming _Neo-California_. These poems are exercises in a very
precise form of lyrical irony that engages with the topographical and
psychological geography of the dystopian paradise that is Northern and
Southern California. Henderson's reading also included a biting elegy for
slain rapper Biggie Smalls that surveyed the various forms of class and race
oppression, the commodification of desire and the general  "mass miasma" of
our times.

The inestimable Bobbie Louise Hawkins assumed the stage next with all her
usual sang froid and panache.  Bobbie's first offerings focused with
trademark crankiness and humor on the inescapable absurdities of
mother-daughter relationships. Next, a meditation on love: its usurpation,
and its ennobling tenderness, that requires only a Yes to change a life.
Bobbie closed by reading her first story, written after getting stoned in
Bolinas in the 70's, a serene and bittersweet remembrance of things Texan.
One of her other trademarks emerged here beautifully - the story as
cognitive process - not a  _something_ to say, but a way to enable a
something unknown to be said.

Anne Waldman began her terrific set with a reading from _Iovis II_, a
section called "Asia," that led us through the weird carnival nightmare
world of the Bangkok sex slave markets. An incredible evocation (and
repudiation) of male lust and rapacity - the carnal unyoked from the
spiritual, eros sick & run amuck, smacking up against itself in the mirror
of thanatos - a tour through the loveless mills of desire, where crimes
against women are status quo, the air one breathes. All of this sung,
hummed, chanted, and piquantly punctuated by alarming barks and deep moans,
the pain of the passage etched in the very sounds, dissonance abutting
dissonance, sound become (returned to) the medium of something primordial,
unnerving, shamanic, like the sequence of pure vowels Pound claimed were
used once to invoke Mithra.

But wait, there's more! Anne followed "Asia" with an elegaic dream poem
about Edwin Denby, Katie Schneeman, and her son, the late Elio Schneeman.
Then came the rousing "Negative Capability Blues," accompanied soulfully by
Marc Miller on sax. A wild, percussive, dionysiac and _funny_ performance.
A selection from a work-in-progress, "Marriage - A Sentence," was next -
this portion a lyrical ode to childhood, and dedicated to Eamon Taylor, son
of Judy Hussie and Steven Taylor. Anne closed with a Buddhist-style chant
for Ginsberg, accompanied by Miller on sax and Steven Taylor on harmonium.
"No plot, no plot, embrace the stars." The overall effect of dissonant
chanting carried great physical power, opening huge and liberating somatic
spaces (i.e. it took the top of my head off).

That ought to have been the climax of the evening. And really, how to top
that, much less follow it? But there was more. One wishes there hadn't been.
But there was more anyhow. I don't know Ed Sanders, but he sure seems like a
heckuva  sweet guy and surely is a much loved presence at these gatherings,
a much historied person and pioneer-teacher-poet. Ed began his set by
recalling his friendship with Janis Joplin. This segued into a rambling
poem-song (set to one of my personal bete noirs, home studio pre-recorded
music) that covered exactly the same territory of the opening anecdote. Ah,
the old double narrative trick, ala Bresson, I thought. Well, no, not
exactly. And to tell the truth, Ed really can't sing very well. And the
whole piece was, well, in a word, maudlin. But better to risk looking the
bardic fool than saying nothing at all. Lament the lyric, commend the
courage, pass the Pabst Blue Ribbon.

The evening closed with everyone singing versions from Ed's collection of
"Verses for the New Amazing Grace." My favorite (in its entirety) was by
Wiiliam Burroughs - "amazing grace, save my face."

That does it for me from the Naropa Summer Writing Program, 1998. Thanks
everybody for your support, disgruntlements, parodies, and very long ears.

All work arrives out of & into a particular context ... this work arrives
goading reply, baiting negativity, "hello, my pants are down--you like take
picture?" ... my primary criticism, then, is not of the work itself but the
approach of the post ... cuz, I actually *agree* ... stormy relationships, in
which both parties are wholly, actively engaged, are infinitely more colorful,
nuanced, & thrilling than the average banter between friendly acquaintances ...
& sure, lots of criticism, at least among contemporary avant-gardists (or
experimentalists, or whatever) is, basically, no more engaged, or engaging,
than the ads for people's workshops you see in Poetry Flash, or the blurbs we
stick on the back of our books like souped-up "Hello, My Name Is" stickers ...
welcome to the Convention, bay-bay, Robert Creeley & Barbara Guest dig you,
natch; now, here's that U-job you ordered, that
dead-poet-appreciation-conference-op, that reading w/ Older Morevisible ... but
you gotta promise-promise-promise to Always Be Nice ... [holds up
Pantone-strip-like swath of fluff; "like anything you see?"] ... at least in
print ... & to our faces ...

BUT ... I disagree, finally, that "the most sincere & useful response to work
is invariably: Glib, Critical, & Acerbic" ... because ... well ... what if
you're being *brilliant*? ... what if I read three lines of your new poem &
wanna instantly marry you? (figuratively speaking) (well, usually) ... the
problem with this statement is that it, taken wholeheartedly, earnestly, &
acted upon, is that, well, it might too easily become REACTIONARY ... like my
ugly paragraph above ... & of what value is that? ... I mean, "really"? ...

... at any rate ... I'm not sure that these poems, _because of their context_,
are not *meant* to be "bad" ... I find it difficult to enter into any serious
engagement with them primarily because, well, for instance, I've been told I
can "to our enduring embarrassment, praise them" ... which, in the context of
everything else said, doesn't read like false modesty, or even genuine
humility. ALSO, and this isn't merely being pedantic, SO MANY of the words in
these poems are misspelled, I have no idea, at a certain point, whether
something said is meant *as said* ... if that makes sense ... I mean, are the
spelling errors the result of laziness? ignorance? or *intention*? ... anyway,
I think, if you're a poet, and you're writing your poems down, it's crucial to
spell them as you intend them to be spelled ... I mean, it's okay to misspell,
if you're grooving down Unintended Lane ... but I sense, here, there's no real
reason to prefer "presant" over "present" or "minnarette" over "minaret" or
"Resnikoff" over "Reznikoff" or "intricanteness" over "[god only knows]" ?
BECAUSE, when I get to:

     Examine the window,
     is it open to the intricanteness of

     a provincial capital? ?"

I don't know whether "capital" really should be "capitol" or it's okay as is: a
pun. So, meaning is lost, the kind of fun I might be having isn't had, etc.,
etc. ? and, dang, man, the possessive "it" *never* gets an apostrophe ... its =
belonging to it; it's = it is ... & the mistake is made twice, so I'm assuming
it's either intended as a "mistake" or the poet doesn't quite have the grasp of
English you come to expect of anything in which you're going to invest your
time & energy ... anyway, there are so many typos in this thing that, if it's
sincere, my response would be, "go through this again; it's not ready yet to be
shown" ... & leave it at that ...

... now, Doug, does this mean I'll never read at Zinc? and, Tony, are you
*sure* you're not one of Doug's pseudonyms? & listees, will you delete
everything I post from now on? ?

? back to, barf, "work,"

        Jordan,

        Being a bit dismayed by the reaction and/or lack thereof to my
original posting spurred by my reading of Watten's poem, I appreciate you
taking issue of whatever sort . . .  As an aside, I'm not particularly
pleased with the references section tagged onto the end of the book.
After the disclaimer up front, the references (laid out much like a
"proper" section of the poem, the heroic couplet driving it all home)
would seem to attach a sort of historical valence to the preceeding text
which it had shyed away from.  But, then I came across this again, perhaps
telling of the totalizing trope in Watten in general, from "Plasma";
        "But there is another level of complexity to ready-mades.  Which
gets us home if you talk about poetry.  You can say what happens and have
it be a part of that."

Mm yes. But elsewhere Watten writes (steals?) that Charlie Brown and Felix
the Cat are codified gestalts for Little Boy and House Pet.

Is Bad History a codified gestalt for Language Project? Language Moment?
(Moment used to mean two minutes.)

Are post-xerox operating systems insidious gestalt generators? I mean any
graphic user interface that persuades you that it's normal to retrieve
your diskette from the computer by placing it in a trashcan, the logic
being that the non-computer world is a giant dump?? I hate windows 95.
Anybody got a standard toshiba cdrom driver they can e-mail me? Apparently
my machine arrived with it pre-recycled.

What will all this revelation of gestalt lead to?

Revelation? Will we be brought _to our senses_? Or isn't that just another
sales pitch. Another nowhere. But then, I can't read the Times, give me
any, give me every other paper.

Signed,
Sighed

Subject:      *money

Hi gang.  Now I'm going to tell you about money.  Hey wait a minute -
you said we said WEDNESDAY, didn't we??  What??  Come back!!!

Money is the inedible sign of real value (labor).

Poetry is the edible sign of possible value (dream).

Experiment, the new, the inexaustible - signs of life, signs indexing the
absence of balance - the early modernists became the idols/fetishes of
what followed because as post-aristocrats/conservatives they could invest
the power of nostalgia with real experience (they had the most toys
growing up - also their 19th century was one giant toy).

So the later avant-garde is between rock & hard place, trying to
be new in a tradition of (conservatively-rooted) newness -

this is emphatically not a new idea & I bring it up in relation to
MONEY -

ie. I think the new century will actually be a socialist century, hard to
believe but... not in a military-leninist-class war sense, but in the
sense of mankind growing into the species-sense, the species inheritance -
so that "bourgois democracy" will be seen as a building block to
social democracy - species-sense or innate sense of common good turning
the excesses of 20th century around slowly toward social control
of capital on behalf of labor/education/environment values -

this is the pipe dream not of adolescent Beats but of their fathers,
the Tom McGraths of the 20th century -

what does have to do with poetry?
Dominant styles reflect cultural impulses & forces - the "alternative"
poetries, built on an ossified tradition of "resistance" without the
umbrella of a wider cultural ("revolutionary") impulse exhibit form
hollowed out by ambiguity doubt tentativeness and knee-jerk victimology -

symptoms of fin-de-siecle -

the poem as a sign of labor - universal labor - the labor of birth-pangs -
a confidence radiating from it which foliates into "full" forms and
relaxed plenitudes - something coming along next year?  Buildings -

the old battles of thing/process, content/form, finish/experiment - well,
they reflect real divisions in reality - ie. if I was building my own house
of course I'd lavish blah blah on it but I'm not building it as an artifact
but something to be lived in by somebody else actually -

we will probably have a new/old concept of poetics, poetic form, in which
experiment/craft/form are not ends in themselves but means to a broader
kind of expression which is the person responding to experience - a
kind of dialectic between language-per-se and what it stands toward -

"There is in English what might be called a permanent experiment, which is
the effort to get the language of poetry back to a certain hard, immediate
actuality, what we are likely to think of as the tone of good common speech."
(Lionel Trilling)

- and the poems we will value in the future will not repeat the coming
cliches of reality (in the future everyone will understand instinctively
and obviously what the common good is, we will need no mouthpieces for
the masses) - but will celebrate the weird toys & reactionary flops and
sad doodles of the 20th century - in all their melodramatic-tragic
stupidity - Robert Lowell will be the favorite poet of the
avant-garde because he's so baroque & good with rhythms and was such
a WASP son of a bitch - (doesn't that sound like something to look forward
to?)  (we were studying the "1960s" in history today - what did she say
a wasp was again?)

Hey Cal,
this shows a lot of promise.  Here's a similar poem I found in an anthology
called E-Z OFF ROSES, publ by Urban Bleat in 1997:

HORSE NICHE (for Krissy Laxativity)

or leaving the excrescences.
my thing called name was, and
then - smeeches all around.
It's, or its?  Yours?

Tripped up and so on toward
morning dune trappings we shanked
a then or.  See it coming and
you won't bark, or, even heard, maybe

Hen - yes, I'm familiar with Little's work. If you know anything of
his milieu, you'll know that he's in dialogue here with Laxativity's
haiku-like poem "Horsey Night", over which they argued furiously
at one of their famed Sunday roundtables. (As I recall, she left in a
rage, slamming his right index finger in the door; he was never able
to type correctly again, a difficulty which lead to his temporary
name change  to "Dend Liddle" in 1966). "Horsey Night" was later to
appear as the first poem in Laxativity's book GODOLPHIN'S MEASURE
(Pusillanimity Press, ca. 1967).

        Smeechless, into sound. It isn't yours to keep

I'm even more familiar with Little Work.  Laxativity & I grew up in the
same Minnesota neigh-neigh-neigh-bore-hood with Ro-ro-robert Bl-Bly,
& I was privuhledged to be in the locale when "Horsey Night" was
underwired.  I think Little tape-recorded some of our conversations,
in fact, before she blew up & nailed his index - you can find them in
the Little Work Archives at Left Overbie U library if you really want
to pursue this further than you have pursued it as far as you have so
far, I mean.  Anyway, Laxative used to rave on intensely about Keats
and open form and the biology of meadows and field operational binoculars
(Zeiss? Seuss?) and that poetry unfettered was like a horse with wings and
here's an early-bird unedited version of "Horsey Night" I just happened
to have on hand in my locale here within reach so to speak of my hand:

HORSEY NUT

There is the horseshoe and then there is you.
And my tiny excretion, my fictive live louvered
Hoover fills    the vacuum
and is
n't

- you can see how far she took it from this rigid fifties product.

Todd, when I lived in LA the lit scene seemed to consist of actors thinking
they could write a poem for a publicity shoot!
As for the Cal-arts kids, I know they have had quite a few group readings at
Skylight Books in Los Feliz, a bunch of them attending a reading of mine
there last year, etc...I can't complain about them - good listeners and
enthusiastic in what i think of as an LA way which may be problematic but is
Refreshing. The Bay Area can be a bit dowdy you know. My sis I know attends
tons of readings, but she is much more focussed on fiction than I am, and
did say she thought the showing for Lynne Tillman at Beyond Baroque was
shockingly paltry.  What about the fact that the dept puts out a beautiful
and well-edited mag?  And a lot of their graduates also have been doing art
reviews, doesn't that count as dialogue?

And yes, Moving Borders is a great anthology.  The introduction gave gobs of
historical info I was eager for too.

reading by Wanda Coleman or Henry Rollins--yeah--rock'roll! THe program

I'm reading with Selby down here next week and afraid we'll have 5

Todd, Elizabeth -- it's been many years since I helped run the Wednesday
night poetry workshops at Beyond Baroque, but that was really the only
"scene" I ever knew, and still is, I suspect.  Do you, though, know
Holly Prado, Harry Northrup, Bill Mohr (an L.A. mover and shaker if
there ever was one), Phoebe MacAdams, Lewis Macadams, Jim Krusoe, Jack
Grapes, Amy Gerstler, Dennis Phillips, Paul Vangelisti . . . . well,
those were only the people I knew and hung out with, but there were
others (Dennis Cooper, of course, before his move to New York) -- but
really -- I admit it can seem a bit provincial compared to the Bay Area
in terms of poetry, but that's the ONLY contest it loses, isn't it?
Which is to say there are . . . compensations, no?

Rolling down the Imperial Highway, big nasty redhead at my side,

Joe

ps: Bill Mohr actually has attacked "Language" writing and other schools
outside of the confessional arena. Hell, once he even wrote me --years
ago--that the "new group" (1980) of poets were untalented and shuld
simply STOP writing! Believe me, it's not just my own personal feeling
that LA is a small town--outside of here many of those peots are unheard
of and don't read magazines or books published by those outside of this
here town. Sometimes I feel like I am stuck in a consistent circle of
voluntary inmates! That's why I go to SF at least 4 times a year--to go
to readings and buy books!

I think my bitter mail got lost in the shuffle--but let me simply say
that the poets you mentioned--and this outside of their own work as
writers--have primarily been exclusive in terms of going to others
readings--promoting others work outside of a "pop" and confessionalist
sensibility. That years before when Barrett W. read to an audience of 8
I was ashamed to be a poet in LA. THat same thing happened to Robert
Duncan year ago--to Fanny Howe recently--etc. Few poets that are listed
in your note suport the work of others besides friends. Yes, I am
bitter--but my job as an editor and teacher is not simply to read and
promote and publish the work of those I like--but to promote and publish
a POETICS that is important. I have published poetry by those whom I
don't think highly of--but whose work I believe deserves to be read! Of
those you mentioned only Paul V. (with whom I started Littoral Books
years ago--along with D, Phillips and Martha Ronk and Lee Hickman) even
show up at the readings that Sun and Moon give--while Douglas M. and
others DO show up at B. B. occasionally! Damn! No compensations besides
the sun! No--a scene is unimportant--a dialectic is of utmost
importance!

MIME-Version: 1.0

Dear List Members -

Sorry to ask so much after such prolonged silence.  I am finishing an
essay on Heidegger and Oppen and would be interested in feedback or
discussion about any of the following three areas.

1) HISTORICAL CONTEXT OF HEIDEGGER RECEPTION IN POETRY PROGRAMS IN SIXTIES
(AND SEVENTIES)

I am looking for scholarly texts, archival materials, or personal
recollections about Heidegger's presence in the consciousness of American
poetry in the period before the Harper & Row translations of the
seventies.  In particular, I would like any influence studies for Duncan,
Levertov, and especially Oppen.  Oppen's personal library was limited to
_Being and Time_ and _Existence and Being_ and from his letters I know
he was very moved by _Identity and Difference_ to the point of ascribing
Yeatsian automatic writing to a particular incident, but I've heard about
other texts from poets who knew Oppen (including some on this list) and
would appreciate details, especially about materials he sent to other
people or readings he suggested.

2) CURRENT ATTITUDES ABOUT TEACHING HEIDEGGER AS PART OF THE POETRY
WORKSHOP AND/OR CLASSROOM

Obviously, now there are some who feel that assigning Heidegger to their
students is like assigning them passages of _Mein Kampf_ to read, but
others on the list seem to be either methodically teaching Heidegger as
part of twentieth century poetry theory or at least providing some
Heideggerian tenets as inspiration.  If you tackle Heidegger, how do you
teach Heidegger and what texts do you chose?

3) THOUGHTS ON HOW HEIDEGGER'S CRITIQUE OF METAPHYSICS MIGHT APPLY IN THE
CLASSROOM.

My current position, toward which I invite debate, is that Heidegger may
be best used in the poetry classroom not as a tool for talking about grand
abstracts like the poet's relationship to the ineffable and the problem of
the unnameable, but for very practical reasons related to his critique of
metaphysics.  To make this manageable (and most relevant to close readings
of Oppen) I am looking at just two parts of his critique of metaphysics:
1) Heidegger's attack on metaphor as a metaphysical construct and 2)
Heidegger's attack on the subject/object relation as it is expressed in
terms of grammatical person.  I welcome comments or suggestions.

Best,

Liz

ps: re yr other message to (me)? (the list)?

I certainly would not say there is no poetry "scene" in LA--I would say
that it is not very public! In writing to folks outside of LA and even
here many don't know about events--not well publizised really--outside
of those that get say Sun and Moon mailings. I sent out 100 invites for
my ReMap party and 200 per event while at Otis (with Noah). We tried to
let the world know about the events. It's hard--i know--but the scenec
needs to be les like the art world and more like a communtiy. I let the
damn weekly know about every event I'm involved with and they have
listed every event. I'd like to see more people at Sun and Moon. And
believe me, my heart has been broken over many of these issue for years!
I've been here my whole life and have heard every excuse for damning B.
B. (many, mine) and/or your ventures or Littorals etc. When it comes
down to it though I believe deeply that if you're not included you are
excluded!  That's why I have 45 subscribers outside of LA for ReMap and
only 3 IN the town I was born in!

Patrick--

You didn't mention that compelling David Henderson line about the fags
invading Boystown, how did it go?  Eileen Myles, Akilah Oliver and I
were discussing our confusion and I decided it was a persona, in the
poem,ya know?

That was Thursday before the clarity of the following emerged at the
Final Friday Panel of Workshop Presentations.

These are the events as I remember them:

Almost all the teachers cme to the questioner’s mike to recap their
workshops, a new convention, up till then they've sat behind the long
table.  Very democratizing.  Eileen Myles hadn’t back from the airport
where she'd gone to pick up novelist Karen Cook so Anne Waldman
pressed Diana Rickard to come up and report, “get your butt up there
you’re an MFA student.”   Victor Hernandez-Cruz gave a long schpiel
about this and entertaining that “we all know that poetry is much harder
than prose and will last longer, because every word matters,” pleasing
or pulleeeese.  Eileen comes back! Anne invites her to speak her
mind--refering apparantly to an earlier exchange.  Eileen says, in
Allen’s absence, Naropa is missing the ‘queer light’ that he shed,(give
her this, that to say anything about Allen at Naropa one must eulogize)
and that she'd been noticing an erasure of queerness at Naropa, despite
the historical & present queer presence in the avant garde tradition,
there is a constant ‘straightening’ so to speak, witness the failure to
write Eileen into the cannon (she is not at all taught at Naropa) and we
all, queer, bi, transgendered, straight must be activist in “queering
the avant garde.”

That’s more or less how she put it.

No sooner did the last word leave her mouth and David Henderson chimes
in with non-sequiter, “Bob Kaufman was a heterosexual,” and then adds,
“a black heterosexual,” as though this addresses what Eileen has just
said.  Anselm Hollo brilliantly chimes, “and Jewish and Chinese.”  And
Max Regan appears, reminds Anne Waldman that she too has taught a
workshop and Anne jokes, “oh that’s right, we let our staff teach,” an
inside joke based on a visitor’s comment.  Max, a known lesbian, goes to
the mike and says “in my workshop we never discussed homosexuality,”
which seems like it is an inside joke to the folks who took her workshop
but to me just sounds like further burial of what Eileen had
just asserted, sort of the opposity of "make it new" on the lines of 'if
it's new and feels threatening, make it go away.'  Then Max, who is also
the administrator, begins to throw animal crackers to those who have
worked for the writing program and as I run up for mine, a dog bites my
ass.  I thought someone had pinched me hard and don’t realize what
really happened until I hear someone else say it, that the dog bit me.
I turn to ___, the dog’s owner and I’m pissed because it hurts and what
the fuck do I know about dog bites, and ___’s totally out of it.  I say,
“Your dog bit me, I don’t like to be bitten by a dog.”  “I’m sorry, I
don’t know what to say, he’s not like that, he must’ve been startled by
your sudden movement.”  I say, “Aren’t you going to discipline him?”
And ____ says, “I don’t hit him.”  “Can’t you tell him -no-?”  I return
from the library bathroom having examined my butt, she’s never left her
seat--events have continued along.  Hours later, a fellow student
approaches me, says “Rachel, I heard you got bit, I heard you really
freaked out and wanted _____ to hit the dog.”

No wonder the avant garde resists its queering.

I'd meant to send this a few days ago but it accidentally went to
ToddBaron.

Mark and Todd et al,

One: a correction: since Mark graduated there is a 3 credit
"contemplative" requirement, which I think, more than make Naropa
vaguely "spiritual" makes it directly parochial, a feeling I have had
all along here.  All the contemplative courses which fill the
requirement have to do with some form of buddhist practice.  I took what
I hoped to be a theater class called "Mudra Space Awareness" and found
it total quackery, a waste of my thousand dollars which I would have
preferred to spend on an academic class on Buddhism, which would not
count to fill the requirement, more about that if anyone is interested.
 Trungpa, no disrespect intended, seems to me to have been a trickster
who was taken too seriously.

Two:  Mark's statement that Naropa's writing program
favors independence and self-study strikes me as correct.  There is not
a multi-pronged curriculum as there is at New College.  I organized an
independent study on Stein with Anne Waldman and three other students.
And my thesis on Ashbery served as yet another ind. study.  However,
Naropa really offers no pre-20th century lit class outside of a new
Blake class taught by Reed Bye and since I've been here, in three years
worth of catalogs, all the major author class offered have been men:
Pound, Blake, Duncan.  I believe before I came a conglom "women poets"
class was taught. I have felt a serious dearth of crit. reading here
with fellow students--that I'm sure changes with each class. Naropa is
workshop-focused with much exposure and much enthusiasm toward reading.
Am I the only current Naropa student on this list?

Three: In case I sound too critical.  Naropa has its foibles but it's
program is run by people truly crazy about poetry and informed and
committed to the avant garde or alternative or wateva ya call
it, and are supportive of passing on the tradition.  The faculty rocks,
and what does Anselm Hollo not know about that is interesting?  Anne
Waldman deserves all the hero-worship she gets.  Besides which (I'm
adding this today) what Patrick says is true, the pieces she read at the
Fox from Iovis 3 knocked me off my seat.  Totally urgent and
unsentimental.

I hope I didn't just bare myself too much in public.

Hey Rachel --
After being bit on the ass, it's hard to know how much to bare...
Here's my 2 cents on Naropa (I finished my MFA there last year):
I did take at least two classes that directly addressed women writers and
writing, and I didn't have such a bad time as Rachel doing the contemplative
thing (though it does fit in oddly at best with the rest of the writing &
poetics program -- seems like it's a concession to the rest of the
Institute, parts of which have expressed resentment toward the writing
department for its "wild" image).

But really the best things about Naropa, other than actually getting a job
when I finished the degree, have been Rachel Levitsky and Anselm Hollo --
and, more vicariously, Patrick Pritchett and Mark DuCharme.

I have a hard time believing anyone goes to school to learn to write -- how
could one teach this? I think, retrospectively, I went to school to learn to
edit (which I desperately needed) and to find someone to talk to about the
things we do and things that are done to us with words. School isn't really
necessary for any of this, but it makes it easier. "You don't need company
to be a surrealist; you need company to be alive." (said Ted) Or as Anselm
once said "we get together to make noises at each other."
I don't know that this addresses Todd's original question...

Great report in all particulars, girlfriend. I have a feeling that that is
the same sassy little dog that ruined somebody's blanket with its voluminous
excrement. Which the distinguished wife of a distinguished foreign poet
subsequently lay in unawares as the light was failing. And which a
distinguished poet from Naropa herself very nearly sat in. As in your case,
the owner of the beast maintained a studied (or is that stoned?)
obliviousness as to her responsibility.

Clearly this "sassy little dog" is the soul of a poet, probably the soul of
a recently departed poet [though I wouldn't know which one], now returned
to bite us, shit on us, and have us roll in its voluminous excrement, as
you so nicely put it [where I come from, this is called "influence"]. I
know all this is true because I have studied Buddhism. You should too. Good
for one's poetics. Or maybe not.

Recently returned myself [from elsewhere], I thank you for this report from
Naropa.

Well, it's been a while since i've decloaked but I have an odd request, which
comes with a little story.  My father just came across a fellow whose
father was a vaudevillian.  In the course of his act he would recite some
sixty different poems.  This fellow my father met, the son who is now an old
man, has spent years tracking down all of these poems and compiling them
into a little pamphlet.  That is, *all but one*.   The lines of the missing
poem would be recited by his father whenever they encountered a railroad
track while driving:

                Giving lurching Lizzy
                all the gas that he could give her...

At this point, his father wld hit the gas and cross the tracks.  I'm guessing
about the line break.  Of course that's Lizzy as in Tin Lizzy, & I must
say I'm charmed by the mimetically lurching trochees.  Any old codgers and/or
masters of arcana out there who can shed some light?

I just want to recommend a fantastic title from Douglas and Sun & Moon.
It's DREAM STORY by Arthur Schnitzler.  I haven't finished it yet, but so
far it is a wonderful book.  Very sexy (well, at least to me!)  I believe
this is the book that Kubrick is filming right now.  If so, in his hands,
it should be an intersting film.  Go buy it!!

just a fan,

Speaking as an  ex- director for Beyond Baroque, I don't think it has
anything to do with politics, but more with promotion.  Plus there are so
many types of people involved with the writing scene - and I mean all
types.  Some are not at all interested in what's out there, but the
poets/writers who have been working on their work for a long time are
interested in other readings, etc.  Plus location is everything.  This is
not only for readings, but also for the films that I used to show.  For
reasons I SORT of understand, people don't like to drive across town for
any reason.  Los Angeles is sort of divided by East side of L.A. and then
there is the westside of L.A.  So in general I think it has more to do with
time, paying attention, and lack of (or bad) promotion.

I can't speak for all readings, but when Lynne read at Beyond Baroque it
was a full house...  and yes, rock n' roll always  bring people out (ie
Rollins, etc.)

Bill is Bill.  He has/had strong opinions in the past.  I don't think he
speaks for a group of poets, but for himself.  Basically he's a very
passionate man and that's not so bad.  And I don't agree with his comments

I would respectfully disagree about the above.  There is a big difference
between a Sun & Moon gathering and a Beyond Baroque reading.  For instince
Beyond Baroque is really open to the general public, and Sun & Moon is
mostly a small gathering of friends and writers.  At Beyond Baroque we
produced (and they still do of course) a calendar that goes out to a
mailing list that we collected at the door and elsewhere.  As far as I
know, Sun & Moon doesn't really advertise, except for individuals calling
other individuals, etc. Also I don't normally see people going to Beyond
Baroque unless they know the writers, etc.  So speaking for myself and
perhaps others, they didn't know or wasn't aware that things were happening
at sun & moon. There are a couple of type of audiences at the Baroque:

One's who go every week no matter what.

Those who know the poet or author.

And those who read about it in a listing in the L.A. Weekly, etc.  When we
get a big plug usually we get a BIG crowd.

 I also want to add that certain writers from Littoral and Sun & Moon were
(and perhaps are) members of Beyond Baroque.

And I might add that people go to things they are interested in.  There is
room for all types of poetics.  And yes, sometimes the small readings are
the best!

As for the comment "Few poets that are listed in your note suport the work
of others besides friends" is not true in my opinion.  I truly find
writers/poets are the most generous group of people - including the names
above.

Pavement Saw Press Chapbook Award Series
Perfect bound   ISBN 1-886350-80-9         Price: $5.00

Right Livelihood  was selected by Jim Daniels
as the 1997-98 winner of Pavement Saw Press Chapbook Award.

Right Livelihood is full of both a hard-earned reverence and a
refreshing irreverence. David Brook’s is not afraid to poke fun at
himself—one man trying to cope with life’s absurdities. Much of this
work is funny, truly joyful. The poems are “expecting something to
happen,” even on the gritty floor of a meatpacking plant. The wonder
here is that something great often does happen. These poems celebrate
our continuing urge to dream. As we discard our “golden visions” of
youth, we must replace them with something. The poems of Right
Livelihood replace those visions with a bemused acceptance— “all the
gaudy world clearing my mind/ like an improbable plane gliding/ over a
mountaintop.” These poems are full of the kind of laughter that hurt
just a little bit—laughter that sinks in, and stays with you for a long
time.

                                                                --Jim Daniels

There is a strong consistent personal voice here, one that may have Eros
in the stomach or specialize in detesting or renting out illusions.
Music, laughter, and insight course like clear water through these
poems.
                                                                --Karl Patten

Witty and elegant, unswervingly aware of life’s absurdity, the poems in
David Brooks’ Right Livelihood drill steadily into the heart and make us
ask for more.
                                                                --Harry Humes


David Brooks was born and raised in central Pennsylvannia. He has worked
in a meat packing plant, a hospital, a nursing home, has installed
insulation, been a masseur, an advertising copywriter, and, for a brief
period of time, a salesman. He lives in Hughesville, PA with his wife.

The Pavement Saw Press Chapbook Award was established in 1995
to promote writers whose work challenges conventions of contemporary
poetry while encouraging multiple readings. Writers world-wide are
invited to participate. Each year, one manuscript is selected by a
writer with a thorough familiarity of the small press realm.
Publication, a prize of five hundred dollars, and ten percent of the
book run was awarded to the winner.

"For the actual difference-along-with-sameness which is found among
species is destroyed by the ignoring of difference for the sake of
residual identity. The conservation theories of energy, mass, and motion
arise out of this same tendency of reason toward identification. In
fact, all those assertions of the persistence of enduring,
self-identical substances, unscathed by time, which professor Whitehead
brings together under the term "simple location," arise out of the urge
toward identification operating in human reason. The fallacy of simple
location arises from the unchecked tendency of reason toward
identification."---from Explanation and Reality in the Philosophy of

Very much so. I also see the (male) promiscuity in early Kundera as very
much tied up with the sixties, and the equation "sleeping around =
liberation". But I'll try anything once.

The Saint-Point quote (from the Futurist Manifesto of Lust, a gloriously
bizarre document) comes after another sentence, "Lust is the expression of
a being projected beyond itself". This, I think, ties "panic" in with the
loss of self, or at least a realisation of the boundaries of the self.

Saint-Point (or at least her translator) uses "lust" in a slightly
different manner from its current connotations of basely instinctual
rutting, what my flatmate from Birmingham calls the "Phwoar!" reaction. She
talks of prising lust away from the fey romanticism of flowers and violins,
but also talks about turning lust into a work of art. So, it's a concept
that's earthier than the "frenchified desire" that the list discussed a
while back, but more complex than what most strip-joint patrons feel.

Kapka Kassabova also investigates the connection between self and desire by
writing of home and exile (she's a Bulgarian immigrant to New Zealand).
I've come to a feeling that desire in all of its forms (whether for a
lover, for family, for home and culture) is an act of annexation, an
attempt to claim a part of the world as part of oneself. This is all still
slopping around my head in a mass of unformed thoughts, quotes and
intuitions, but I've begun to wonder whether the sort of poetry that I've
been working for is a text that is to language what desire is to the self.
Language caught in the act of desire, language "projected beyond itself",
language aching for non-language and finding that it can never be reached.
Maybe this is a definition of poetry. I don't know.


Speaking of Kundera, have you read "Getting used to dying" by (I think)
Zhao Xianling? He's been called "the Chinese Kundera", and while that's a
gross oversimplification, it's not too far off. An incredible book, anyway.

        Cheers,

                Tom.

I suppose the 'particular incident' you are referring to is the composition of "Route" and what ultimately became section 13 . (You have obviously read the note Oppen wrote to himself on June 1, 1966 , included in Selected Letters of George Oppen , waking up after writing the lines he believed he would have to put quotation marks around , thinking the lines were from Heidegger,  and "reacting with shock"(to quote Oppen) , that they occurred nowhere in the essay 'Identity and Difference', where Oppen was sure he had read there.

Though be careful calling this Yeatsian. Did Oppen ever discuss in his poetry or letters or conversations at anytime, the sense of the process as being anything  Yeatsian or 'automatic writing'? And yet it does seem reasonable in some way to talk not about the "mystical" . Would it be more precise to call it"uncanny", eerie, unsettling, troubling. Perhaps 'panic' could be used here to get close to Duncan's sense of the word.I think this is one place where you need to differentiate between "visionary recital" and "versionary incitement". Maybe one could try to stand in for Oppen  at this moment, reacting with shock, then , imagine yourself trying to hold off the sense of panic by focusing in on

"a care for inaccuracies; I strive in the poem not to make some imitation of a model experience but to go deeper and deeper into the experience of the process of the poem itself. "(Robert Duncan)

I like very much something Emmanuel Levinas said in an interview about Heidegger , and what it "meant" to first read him (obviously Levinas is credited by Sartre and others as introducing into France Husserl's 'phenomenology' and Heidegger's critique of it, in the mid 1930's).

How are students in the classroom taught to listen to Oppen? How can you accustom the student to a reading of poetry? With Heidegger do they feel that they are reeducating the ear to listen to what is not "there" to be heard? Or is philosophy and the teaching of poetry just another example of  how we end up talking past each other?

And, inclining with the ear,  what kind of head do they bring? Was it Wittgenstein who said that a philosopher's head is full of question marks? Won't the discussion of Heidegger (ie.,the essence of man takes the form of a question) force them to bring this kind of head to Oppen? Is it valid to read him with that kind of head? You know, Oppen and his poetry of ideas? Lots of problems . LOTS. Isn't this bound to be a mistake? Or is it a mistake?

 Where do question marks stop filling the 'head' and instead become, for example, 'marks whereby the body was said to be a world'(M.P.) , which in turn becomes another version and possible reading?

***


I just recently mentioned in a post a few days ago about "Oppen's breakthrough year of 1966", and this incident was part of that. One could argue for other breakthrough years, ie. Meeting Mary Colby and finding poetry in 1926…late 20's meetings with Zukofsky and some aquaintance with Reznikoff, mostly reading a lot of his poetry…Wounding at the Battle of the Bulge 1944…Flight to Mexico to escape the McCarthy, et.al withhunts in the early 1950's…Return to poetry after the 'Rust in Copper' dream (controversy as to the year…perhaps 1958)…but for a number of reasons you've got to consider this year 1966 for many reasons which I can't describe here).

*****

I'll wait and see what others mention about Heidegger in the classroom. This has been discussed on the list before. It will probably raise the temperature some.

I am reconsidering my position toward Heidegger which I had when I first read What is Called Thinking or most ofPoetry, Language, and Thought. I think part of my position stemmed from feeling that we knew  Heidegger must have been sincere because of how important poetry was to his teaching and writings…sincerety, is perhaps the word I'm searching for here…But is Heidegger' s attention to poetry, especially Holderlin, proof of something necessarily?

I question that initial gut feeling from my first readings of Heidegger perhaps illustrated in this remark by Emmanuel Levinas in a conversation with Philippe Nemo published in Ethics and Infinity:

LEVINAS>>"I know that the homage I render to Sein und Zeit seems pale to the enthusiastic disciples of the great philosopher. But I think the later work of Heidegger, which does not produce in me a comparable impression, remains valuable through Sein und Zeit. Not, you well know ,that it is insignificant; but it is much less convincing. I do not say this owing to Heidegger's political engagements, taken several years after Sein und Zeit, even though I have never forgotten those engagements, and though Heidegger has never been exculpated in my eyes from his participation in National-Socialism."

PHILLIPE NEMO>>In what does the second part of the Heideggerian work disappoint you?

LEVINAS>>" Perhaps by the disappearance in it of phenomenology properly speaking; by the first place that the exigesi fo Holderlin's poetry and the etymologies began to occupy in his analysis. O course, I know that in his thought the etymologies are not a contingency; for him language bears a wisdom which must be clarified. But this way of thinking seems to me much less verifiable than that of Sein und Zeit- - - a book in which, it is true, there are already etymologies , but adjacent and which only complete wht is eminently strong in the analysis proper and in the phemomenology of existence."

Bill Mohr's always been supportive and it was fun to see him when I was in
San Diego most recently.

But I understand the impulses behind Todd's original complaint. Scenes have
their own unique dynamics and it seems like every city -- NYC and SF
included -- have their fallow periods from time to time. I've given readings
to audiences of 3 (at Hallwalls in Buffalo -- it was one of the best
readings I've ever given) and Leslie Scalapino and I once gave a reading to
an audience of 5 in SF (at USF to be exact). The largest audience I ever
read to in LA came primarily to hear my reading mate, Jack Grapes. But I had
a huge crowd once in Missoula. And likewise on Maui at a little used
bookstore/cafe.

Lee Hickman used to complain that he caught static from his local friends
for publishing anyone outside LA in Boxcar, which only made him more
determined when he moved on to Temblor. Some of the early SF langpo
publications also had a decidedly "west of the Bay Bridge" bias that always
made me (who'd started publishing earlier and had friends in far places like
NY and Chicago) a little nervous.

Time and mobility has a tendency to take care of much of this. Thanks to the
internet Meikal And & I can be virtual neighbors, tho his woods and my own
must be very different.

Liz,

Saw your post on Poetics list. I'm at work and rushing around, and
would very much like to have an extended dialogue with you about
Oppen and Heidegger, about Oppen generally and about Heidegger
generally.  For now only these first thoughts/suggestions:
In order of importance, perhaps:
1/ Contact Cid Corman in Japan (I have his address at home if
you need it).  He is absolutely a key figure for your inquiry,
since he was an early translator of MH and as well an early
conduit for GO to MH.  He knows a lot about this, I suspect,
that has yet to be written down.
2/ A couple of issues back in Talisman there was an essay on
GO and MH (it still sits unread just in back of my keyboard,
since I am slowly coming down from an incredibly busy year or
two).
3/ Check out my just released book on William Bronk (it can
be order from Associated University Presses at aup440@aol.com,
but eventually the book will be in libraries) which contains
some subtantial informatio and analysis of GO and MH (as well
as of WB and MH).  I will also have an essay out from Sagetrieb
on WB and GO that takes up the MH influence and in their case
connection to a degree). Again, I don't have typescript on
me at present to send you.

More later. . .

Oh yeah, there's someon at Ohio State I think who is doing an
Oppen book (I have his edress somewhere and will try to send it
along).

Good hunting,

Burt

FIRST MAMMALS SENT AS ATTACHMENTS

Buffalo, New York. July 16 (MP): With the recent upgrade of UB's email
system, it is now possible to send live animals across the Internet.
Researchers hope this will greatly expand the travel industry by the
year 2010. As a test, Poetics is sending out a small "Rat." If the rat is
not alive when you decompress it, or if for some reason  you cannot
receive the small lab rat, your matter filters are not adjusted properly.
Also, if the Rat has any physical or behaviorial problems, or if it does
not exactly look and smell like a rat, etc., then please report to the
home office. The rat's first words should be (deadpan, of course): "Take
me to your leader."
*       *       *
Our system came up only this morning. Apologies to all those whose lives
may have been disrupted by the disruption in Poetics service.

Tosh,

I certainly was not trying to compare the two organizations.
However, there is no question that Sun & Moon--with its bookstore,
its salons and the drama reading series we co-sponsor with
Bottoms Dream--has served as a kind of smaller literary center.
I should add that our mailing list includes about 350 people, and
fliers are sent our for each salon and postcards every month for
the drama reading series (which is also sent to about 500 people
by Bottom's Dream) so neither series of events represents "a small
gathering friends and writers." As with Beyond Baroque, of course,
we do not ever get the full audience. But they're invited; the
public is also free to attend. Tosh, maybe you should attend.

Todd--

my address is 2965 13th Street, Boulder, CO 80304.

I heard Diane DiPrima lecture on Shelley the first summer I was in
Boulder.  She was awesome.

Whitman is major, but what he was reacting to, & his sense of line, was
an entirely different historical condition.  We've had Williams &
Creeley, among others, since.

I too reject a narrow interest in "self."  This is why I say that I may
be atypical of "Naropa poetics" (Laura, Rachel & a few others
notwithstanding).

My own tendency, in my studies & in my writing, would be toward a
non-"occult" reading of possibly occult texts, such as those of Spicer
or Rimbaud who truly were interested in that sort of thing.  This is not
to "de-occult" their work, but to say that the occult axis is not my
primary interest in them.  This goes back to the spirituality thing, no
focus for me; & the word on the page, the temporal mo(ve)ment, the poem
as active gesture w/in such immediacy, the gestural move toward reader,
then, would be a primary source of value. (Jackson Pollock's more of an
"influence" in this regard than Duncan-- sorry).

Interesting though it is, I'd personally (respectfully) reject Duncan's
notion of "occult science," er even occulting Dickinson. I do love
"'Trust the poem' never the poet." Not sure how this relates to th'
Naropa/NC thing....

What Naropa & New College have in common is they are Western United
States, non-ivy league (i.e., NOT the Killer Bees) programs, grounded
in, for lack of a better term, a "counterpoetics" tradition that is both
a literary & a social nexus.  I think that sense of mystery you speak to
is different-- necessarily so-- for different practitioners, & thus is
only a common ground in only the most general sense.

Interesting to (continue to) explore these connections/comparisons--

Best,

Mark

Ron is abolsutely right--my complaints were really meant to stir up
dust--some of my best readings have been to less than 10--and ALWAYS
it's those who listen anyone--in crowds=etc.  THere are certainly poets
in LA that participate--and my friendship with Lee taught me a lot about
both those that do and those that don't--the really sad thing is that
those that don't(here in LA) are often those that create a politically
(sorry--that's NEVER the right word--"socially"?) sorry state . Since LA
has a relatively small community (again--maybe the wrong term) keeping
away from readings--not going to them--not reading magazines that
contain work outside of one's scope of "friends"/etc. sets up our city
as a place where there is little DISCOURSE. DISCOURSE to me is what
creates a poetics. And so--a sense outside of LA of what we have to
offer--is limited. A sense inside too--makes it hard to work here. As
I've published  (along with Tosh in the 1980s) two magazines here--each
time I have I've had responses about publishing "language"
writers--writers otuside of LA/etc. When I and Noah De Lissovboy strated
the Otis Art Institute "Writing the Margins" reading series--we were
literally (the right word!) attacked for creating a schism in LA! Now,
hey, we had writers from "up north" AND LA read here, poets from San
Diegeo/etc. Many of ths great readings were so little attended that we
were embarrased as hosts! Ill-attended by folks we expected would have
been excited about such a new series. Consequently the school said --not
again--. And we lost!

I hope this dicussion remains not simply one of "townships" --but it
seem inherently important for those of us trying for a "public" persona
and doing public work such as magazines and presses. Thank g-d for this
internet, as Ron said, now at least I feel like LA is simply that place
"outside"...

One last thing: an important thing: Not only for the few of us in LA--


Leland Hickman did the most outstanding job anyone has every done in
this--or any other--city. He published two magazines that were of the
utmost importance to us all. Having all "schools" of writing
there--having Ron S. next to a piece by Amy Gerstler/etc. and filling
the damn void with poetry was indeed a magic job. His politics were
outsdtanding and obvious. He, too, rambled on about the idiocy of the
city he called "home"--where 10 poets refuse to speak to 3 others/etc.
He was attacked/etc. But it all came down to what was good for the
art--what kept it aflloat. It is in this spirit that I have angrily,
bitterly, and happily--started this discussiong--which--at
botton--really asks--what to do in this--or any other city--when poetry
and poetics is at risk--when "groups" form that exclude other
"groups"-when groups are thought to exist where there are none--etc. I'm
not for rallying around the flag--but--a community discourse in
obviously needed. LA is a great example of a city with resources and
millions of people and vast geographies (no matter how far apart we are
or how freakin' busy! I've know poets to drive 40 miles to eat at a
"new" resturant--we can do the same for a reading!) and a problem with
getting folks to pay attention to the valid work that is created here
and outside of "here". LACMA has a reading series (the county art
musuem) Athe Balconey Cafe reading series exists (Littoral Books),
Skylights Books has a reading series, Beyond Barqoue exists, Sun and
Moon has their Salons, and the Hammer museum has had some amazing
readers of late. THese venues need to start a discourse--start to talk
to one another--as poets in this town need to do--not just in
"gatherings of friends and dinners"--but to gather to see if there is a
solution to the late-20th Century demise of Poetry--funding
undercut--publications dropping like flies, etc.  Hell--in LA our own
newspaper refuses to publish review of "local" or "new"
poetries--instead publishing an occasional poem by Carolyn Forche or the
like as a way out of that commitment!

I am afraid of all the loss--as Lee said " get the work done"
--this is all part of the work.

Rachel,

Thanks for your post.  I didn't know about the added contemplative
requirement, & this strikes me as useless.

When I was a student @ Naropa I co-organized two independent studies w/
other students & faculty, one on the Language Poets, the other on the
Objectivists.

The lit curriculum is, or can be, a real weak point in the program-- hit
or miss, as I was trying to convey, based on faculty interest.  I think
it's a scandal that figures like Stein, Niedecker, Woolfe, etc., haven't
rated a major author course.  Interest in non-Beat contemporary
poetries/poetics among the writing community is shockingly low.

That said-- Anselm is a natural treasure, Jack a national wonder, & Anne
continues to be a model of energy & endurance.

Is it baring oneself in public too much to speak the truth?  For the
sake of all concerned, for the sake of the work, I hope otherwise.

--Mark

Subject:      wrasslin with Rasula

Since nobody wants to talk about money, here's another hot topic, Jed
Rasula's AMERICAN POETRY WAX MUSEUM, which I have been unable to put down
the past few days.  I guess it was probably yakked up here a few years
back?

What an amazing history lesson this book is, the way he engages "poetics"
as a whole conflicted field of engagement.  I'm not done with it yet, but
the readings from Louise Bogan, Karl Shapiro, & a lot of others are great -
and the "blistering indictment" of the changing/unchanging poetry
establishment, all the distortions that have been written into the
fading canons...

just some problems I'm starting to have with it, since I have to
argue with everybody these days, or try to -

I wonder about the overall conceptual frame of it - I guess (wild ignorant
guess) it's sort of a Foucauldian-anarchist frame of history - a sort of
enormous suspicion of state-cultural "structures" - is this the
criticism of sane paranoia?  I mean he frames his absolutely necessary
critique in the "wax museum" conceit - implying that culture, like
a museum, is a subset of the nation-state, and it's the coercive,
"carceral", institutional taming/homogenizing/hegemonizing reality
that distorts the museum-goer's perception of the artworks encased
therein -

I guess what troubles me is the paranoiac aspect of this kind of critical
thinking: "things are never what they seem" is like the mirror-image of
("fascist") status-quo "things are only what they seem" establishment
thinking.  Since I haven't finished the book, I wonder if Rasula ever
examines whether there's not a contradiction involved in the hindsight-
historical packaging of this kind of study: ie. his metaphor of the
wax museum could be applied to his own book (more like a diorama of
civil wars).  So that nothing is what it seems: the only purpose of the
state is coercive-numbing mind control; the only purpose of the museum
is to replicate that "control"; both artworks & museum-goers are
puppets in that scenario; Robert Lowell is a puppet of the New Critics;
Helen Vendler is a puppet of the same long-lasting establishment;
the "lyric" in poetry is a mask for uncritical thinking; etc. I would
argue that scary as it may seem the democratic state does have a long
and bloody real history and a legitimate purpose, and if this is the case,
museums, universities, and individual artworks & poets and lyric poems
might also have a legitimacy - not a perfect legitimacy by any stretch of
the imagination - Rasula de-legitimizes them in all justice - but I
wonder if the "controlling metaphor" doesn't in its own turn go too far.

My first response to the book is that it's absolutely necessary even
if it can be faulted for its own semi-p.c. manuevering (ie. I got
the sense that women poets were slightly criticized for developing
their "own" networks, but black poets were above criticism for the
same thing - it's called creative "secession". Correct me if I've
misread this.)

This book is part of an opening-up of poetry culture by carefully
going back over what's just barely visible & re-measuring things.
I think that in future decades the saddest aspects of this history will
be the numbing controls in place of "official" literature, and secondly
the harshness of the name-calling and the tendentiousness of the
various positionings.  I also think Rasula actually over-emphasizes
some of the political differences between poetic approaches; I mean,
this is historically correct for the era he writes about but the issue
of "open" vs. "received" forms vs. new forms is still in for some
major new wrinkles.  Rasula contrasts for example Duncan's open form
as a reassertion of Keatsian romanticism with the establishment poetics
of the 50s as a contrived and superficial formalism; but the strictly
historical - I mean literary-historical meanings of some of these
metaphysical and renaissance forms in my opinion has not been completely
used-up simply because the 50s pseudo-modernists found them useful for
promoting their fantasy world.

One of the never-forgettable lessons of this book is that writers come
out of their own different histories and nothing is simple.  That may
seem so obvious now to most as to not constitute a lesson.  But for a
wasp boomer from the midwest born into the American language of his
ancestors, who came to poetry with the sense that the work of writing
was a sort of neutral ground of accomplishment, where the self met the
community on the stage of achievement and the community met the self
there, and there was an honest exchange because the poem on the page
is sort of like a testament or a constitution, an accurate measure of
work done, and so the obvious thing to do with it was to send it out to
magazines in a disinterested way & let quality float to the top -

when you find out that there's another reality out there - that the
publishing venues are designed to filter out quality based on 2 things:
a particular editor's notion of what you've done, and second, a hidden
buddy system or control system; and then you find that there are these
"communities" of writers who share ideological/aesthetic visions & then
feed them back to one another & push into the publishing venues as groups,
and everyone on the poetics list from Don Byrd on down laughs at the
notion of "independent standards" of criticism and reading (this is not
to single out Don Byrd for anything negative, just a memory of the indie-
crit flap) -

well, you take all this into account & things are very complicated suddenly...
so complicated that I think I'll just go back to my original idea: let
it happen in the poem, & give them all the lie.  The open form concept is
marvelous: but the poem is also a toy.

Henry, I was gonna talk more about money but I just got finished reading
your 2,000 word post about it and now there's another one! You have to
give some of us slowpokes a break now and then, pard!

What I was going to say is that I'm now halfway through _Frozen Desire_,
the book I quoted from a few days back and it's still just wonderful.
With these tidbits . . .

* The difference between the _Iliad_ and the _Odyssey_ is the invention
of money -- if there had been any in the _Iliad_, Achilles could have
been bought off. "The issue is not resolved through money. It is not
resolved at all, except by death. For money cannot coexist with an epic
picture of the world." ("Longinus admired the _Iliad_ beyond all
expressions of the human spirit but called the _Odyssey_ a 'comedy of
domestic manners.')

* Herodotus lived in what is now Bodrum in southern Turkey, where "the
first things that have survived that we can call coins were struck late
in the seventh century B. C. . . . Embedded in the first book of the
_Histories_ is an immense monetary anthropology."

* Something I had known, but forgotten -- Aristotle's hostility to money
as capital in _The Politics_: "It is the rallying cry and point of
honour of all those who dislike or distrust capitalism." Pound couldn't
find much in Aristotle's _Nicomachean Ethics_, as I recall, but
Aristotle would have liked the usury cantos . . . a lot!

And finally . . .

"Imagine a landscape: a meadow sloping steeply down to a stream, a mill
with a watersplash, a locked chapel, a stand of oaks. You will see in
this landscape values both economic, in its actual and potential crops
of fruits, grain, timber and money, and aesthetic, in its resemblance to
a painting or a touristic brochure or a literary fantasy of rusticity.
What you will not feel is the medieval sense of the place's uniqueness.
For to the Middle Ages, the valley I am talking about had no exchange
equivalent, was inextricably bound up with its lord and tenants, could
be improved or ruined but not sold and bought, for it existed in a sort
of spiritual mortmain, still, inalienable, come to rest. . . It was the
final and perfect embodiment of property as the earthly counterpart and
sample of God's realm in heaven, eternal . . . at least until a Mirabeau
or Napoleon Bonaparte comes along."

He then goes on to say exactly how the inception of a money economy
changes this land and what happens to it: it's pretty fascinating. I'm
not trying to suggest that we can somehow exist without money today
(unfortunately!), only that we realize the myriad ways it infests our
perceptions, actions, and choices -- both of how we lead our lives and
how the next line should break . . .

Well, I guess I'll post, too, since I'm also a graduate of Naropa.  I
certainly appreciate your honesty, Mark.  (Do you remember me?  I
remember you, though we never really talked.)

I wish I had known about your independent studies on the language poets
and the objectivists.  I would have participated.  I, too, think it was
surprising that no formal class on Stein was offered.  I have since had
an intense love affair with her writings.

The spiritual side of Naropa was half the reason I attended and the
amount of spiritual work I did there was invaluable.  I personally found
the Mudra Space Awareness class to be helpful especially in relation to
writing for a printed page.  The concepts and experiences there carried
through for me.

But, back to Todd's original question about how a POETICS school has
effected my writing... the lack of language-centered study and the
almost fanatical devotion to beat poets and their descendents turned me
towards a rejection of that 'style' so to speak.  I would second Mark's
assessment of the teachers there and add that I really connected with
Bobbie's southern 'charm', and that her performance prose classes did
more for my development as a poet than anything else there.

The fact that we were side by side with the Buddhist studies program and
the transpersonal psychology department made for an interesting mix of
ideas and taste.  I'd hang out with my poet friends at the Sundowner
playing pool and drinking beer and playing old country songs on their
jukebox, and in the same day I was having tea with the buddhist folks
and giving all those hugs to the psyche people.

I regret that at the time I was probably a little to shy to get into any
in-depth work with Anne (though I remember waltzing with her at that
buddhist center on the tibetan new year).  I think I would have gotten
quite a lot out of it, but I was too busy being a loud poet and trying
to get attention through quirky sex poems and long emotional ventings.
I've certainly grown up a bit since then (not to say what I did was
childish!), and the so-called 'lineage' (if there is one) that Naropa
passed down is still in my work, but I've continued my studies both in
poetry and spirit.

Ah, so there's my 2 1/2 cents.

--trace--

P.S.  Those at Naropa, say hi for me and tell 'em I still exist and am
dying for kindred spirits out here in Portland, OR!

Pavement Saw Press Chapbook Award Series
Perfect bound   ISBN 1-886350-80-9         Price: $5.00

Right Livelihood  was selected by Jim Daniels
as the 1997-98 winner of Pavement Saw Press Chapbook Award.

Right Livelihood is full of both a hard-earned reverence and a
refreshing irreverence. David Brook’s is not afraid to poke fun at
himself—one man trying to cope with life’s absurdities. Much of this
work is funny, truly joyful. The poems are “expecting something to
happen,” even on the gritty floor of a meatpacking plant. The wonder
here is that something great often does happen. These poems celebrate
our continuing urge to dream. As we discard our “golden visions” of
youth, we must replace them with something. The poems of Right
Livelihood replace those visions with a bemused acceptance— “all the
gaudy world clearing my mind/ like an improbable plane gliding/ over a
mountaintop.” These poems are full of the kind of laughter that hurt
just a little bit—laughter that sinks in, and stays with you for a long
time.
                              --Jim Daniels

There is a strong consistent personal voice here, one that may have Eros
in the stomach or specialize in detesting or renting out illusions.
Music, laughter, and insight course like clear water through these
poems.
                              --Karl Patten

Witty and elegant, unswervingly aware of life’s absurdity, the poems in
David Brooks’ Right Livelihood drill steadily into the heart and make us
ask for more.
                             --Harry Humes


David Brooks was born and raised in central Pennsylvannia. He has worked
in a meat packing plant, a hospital, a nursing home, has installed
insulation, been a masseur, an advertising copywriter, and, for a brief
period of time, a salesman. He lives in Hughesville, PA with his wife.

The Pavement Saw Press Chapbook Award was established in 1995
to promote writers whose work challenges conventions of contemporary
poetry while encouraging multiple readings. Writers world-wide are
invited to participate. Each year, one manuscript is selected by a
writer with a thorough familiarity of the small press realm.
Publication, a prize of five hundred dollars, and ten percent of the
book run was awarded to the winner.

I have attended some wonderful events at Sun & Moon.  I should go to more
events.  Time, and... time is against me.  Also, I hope no one see's my
privous post as a negitive commentary on Sun & Moon.  As a new publisher
(yours truly) Douglas is truly one of my heroes.  I was commenting strictly
on Todd's viewpoints on L.A. readings,  and various schools of poetry.  If
I sounded harse in regards to other organizations, I am sorry.  I didn't
mean that whatsoever.  The truth is we need a healthly Sun & Moon as well
as a healthy Beyond Baroque.  It is not only  a local thing, but Beyond
Baroque as well as Sun & Moon has supported artists from different cities
and nations.  Many people see these organizations as being only L.A., but I
see these organizations more as an international as well as a local outlet
for writing, etc.  Besides it is not really an aesthetic problem but a
financial problem.  And that is affecting culture in general.  For the work
Beyond Baroque & Sun & Moon has done, it should be RICH RICH!!  And that
goes for other art organizations!

As an aside, and I say this in all friendship.

tosh:

yr right--tyhe entire discussion on my part really has the same
motive--to begin a DISCOURSE (large) about what to do in a city that
funds everything else so wonderfully--but cannot seem to fit two venues
into one city of 4.5 million people. It, I'm afraid, is political and
suirely not simply a problem of funding. If we haven't learned by now
how to avoid that pitfall--late 20th century--than we haven't learned
much in the way of being public with our art!

BB vrs Sun and Moon--no--I doubt anyone thought you were saying that.
BUT--a political aesthetic is (IS) at foot and hand when one sees
various and sundry wonderful porgrams in other cities--translation
programs--seminars on late 20th century poetics--arts and poetry--to
name a few recent happenings--and LA can't seem to support one even.
(NO--NO--they don't happen here--they don't work here--WHY? support!
RibOt has had the only "conference" in my mind of great value in MANY
years! See the last RiBot for evidence. the LA POETRY FEST. just--I'm
afraid--doesn't count. It's a conservative "pop" forum)  I think BB gets
the raw deal because BB is and says it is--the "only" literary arts
center in LA." While this is VAGUELY true--you--more than any single
soul --must know that the board of directions has--like any other (give
them that) an agenda. The agenda doesn't always parlay into a stance
towards or even against a "poetics"--not when the board is made up of
those not in the field of literature per se. Artists that work in a
visual medium are not necesarily the best to overse a oftimes federally
funded venue! THAT's given BB a "bad" name--and--again--deserved or
not--folks in this asylum are/have been/fed up with the "blackness" of
the place. (Literally--the stage itself is solid black!) BUT--of
course--suport the venues we must. I won't pretend not to accept a
reading there--I go where invited! Several this past week in LA have
said they missed a GREAT reading by Diane Ward and Noah De Lissovoy
simply because "B.B. is not a place of importance anymore..." and the
like.

Phew~! Listen--we barely f**kin exist! No life support is wrong at this
time--esp. the simple support of a poetics community!

Breath!

Tb
(ReMap)

ps: "distance" is no excuse. People in this pueblo travel forty miles to
try the new "Japo-French-Columbian-Hungarian--Fried Chicken"
resturant--further for a cocktail party--less for a reading!!! (Unles of
course you count the readings where "stars" read "their" poems!)

It sounds like the group consensus is--paraphrased--so far--that a
poetics dept. doesn't really affect the poets involved! Otherthan the
standard--I studied this and studied that! I wonder...what about the
idea of beiung in large groups of poets and poet-teachers--and readers!?
Isn't this a different world than one re-enters after grad?

    I read "wax museum" several years ago, and though i find it
    a great read (and have lot of notes on it lying around somewhere
    just waiting for more free time to....) i guess the big memory
    --or the most recurrent one--is the superficial organizing structure
    of a kind of manichean dualism: berryman and lowell--bad suns of
    pound-- vs. duncan and olson good (or less "museumed" because
    less "museumable" presumably); also the characterization of
    bogan as THE woman......
    ------
    A RELATED (or relatable) topic I'd like to start:
    and i heard one of those alan (i think not allen) watts lecture
    tapes on WFMU today and realize how he often gets me and how
    I haven't read him in years....
    read him before keroauc (and read "dharma bums" not knowing he
    was a character in it. tempted to go back and try to find the
    passages)
    anyway, when i was a philosophy major as undergrad, i was very
    into THE BOOK (on the taboo against knowing who you are or something)
    and THE WISDOM OF INSECURITY. My Philosophy teachers of course said
    "well, he isn't really philosophy." Did that have something to do
    with my switching to English major?
    so, any "defenders" or "detractors" of Watts out there?
    (this is not an issue of "but he's not original; just a popularizer
     of other ideas, etc." but more of an issue of his particular
     style (as writer and/or performer) and the way it relates
     to what is more "properly" called poetry.
     Is he in the wax museum too?

I have actually been pretty surprised with the turnouts at readings which
snail or email calendars to me (so that I can put a copy on my fridge and a
copy at work):  Beyond Baroque, Sun & Moon, and Writers on Site are the big
three as far as organizational skills/mailings go.  I am really sorry I missed
Fanny Howe at Midnight Special, as she is one of my favorites, and they do
have an e-mail list for readings.

Complete listings of LA area readings are very helpful and much appreciated!

I missed a slew of readings recently.  But really, these several-hours-in-a-
car-to-and-fro slogs around smog city for readings are not pleasant.

Now it transpires that David Bromige's troublesome novel _Piccolo Mondo_,
which has been for 6 months on line from Coach House Books, is at last out
as a fetish object from CHB. It is a thinly fictionalized account of poetic
and student life in the late fifties and early sixties, and manages to
speak badly of just about everyone in both those spheres from that time.
Tch tch.

this consensus seems to me to underestimate the power and varieties of
"influence."  of course people would claim to not be influenced by their
poetics department; even in a post-structuralist world people have some
investment in their own "originality," or at least might not see the
influence of anything as banal as an institution.

Henry,

i believe you are over-intellectualizing the perspective and theses of the
Wax Museum.  It might well be glossed as having a "foucauldian-anarchist"
framework;  but that would be your parsing-out of the approach JR
takes...I don't believe he sets out to utilize a specific
critical/historical methodolgy.  Nor is one in evidence in my opinion,
beyond a certain commonsense literary-historical narrativity (overlain
by those fancy pyrotecnix involving the museum trope, which have blown
more than a few people away, but which after a while come to seem just
a mite tedious, not to say extrinsic to the specific historical
insights...)

And your claim (as i understand it)  that the book demonstrates a "nothing
is what it seems" philosophy is just plain silly.  "Robert Lowell is a
puppet of the New Critics?"  You're not serious, right?  Lines of relation
and force and clash Rasula does indeed trace.....But the paraphrases you
give are nonsense.  That Lowell and the NCrits are part of a single very
basic and powerful moment in the americun po'tree, is fairly self-evident.
Indeed, MUCH of what the Wax Museum says is (like this example) hardly
controversial at all!  it is the sweep and fairness and specificity of
JR's account that seem important. Of course if he really said Lowell was
somebody's puppet, that might be a little controversial, but he doesn't.
He points out alliances and influences and other lines of relation, that's
all.  (And, as i've posted here in the past, the other thing i find
important about the book is the intelligence and nonpartisan attention
with which he approaches the task of analyzing the "social sites" of
poetry vocation...)

from amongst the foo-cold of poetry,
mark p.

*************************************************************************
COMBO is a journal of poetry and poetics designed as a forum for younger,
innovative writers in their 20's and early 30's.  Our premise is that it's
impossible to answer questions like "What do we find in the way of work
[by younger writers] that is actually new?" (Ron Silliman), unless there
are contexts in which to ask them.  With one exception, all the younger
writers here contribute 3 or more poems or 3 or more pages of work.  The
more established writers were asked to contribute because, by some random
and unscientific consensus, they have influenced those younger writers.
Harryette Mullen's contribution is a 16 page interview, occupying the back
pages as part of an ongoing discussion of poetics.

COMBO is 52 pages on nice off-white paper, side-stapled with cool glossy
card stock cover.  So, go ahead and see what the upstarts are starting
up!!

Copies are $3, which can be sent to

Michael Magee
31 Perrin Ave.
Pawtucket, RI 02861

Feel free to e-mail requests to mmagee@dept.english.upenn.edu & we'll be
glad to send a copy out in advance of payment, we're a trusting (and
trustworthy) bunch.  Hope to hear from many of you!!

There seems to be a storehouse of available public attention that
recycles itself periodically.  And, each poet/student lays themselves
out in the field of visibility in such a way that each poet/student
gathers the maximum amount attention that they're capable of (ready
for).  The whole field shifts and undulates as people come and go, the
storehouse of public attention rises and falls, the teachers point focus
to one spot, then another.

Imagine a park.  Three people triangulate the perimeter, each with a bag
of bread crumbs.  Each toss by the feeders sends the pigeon/poets in
flight, each at their own pace.  The flock/herd seems elastic.  The
feeding continues.  The bread runs out.  Then what?

Subject:      *wrasslin with Rasula

Mark, I agree with you that the very best thing about WAX MUSEUM is the
in-depth research & subtle grasp of what was at stake & all the various
debates that went on over that 40 yrs.  Just a couple of reiterations:
I don't agree that it's silly to summarize his take on R. Lowell as a
"puppet" of the New Critics - he goes to great length to show that that is
EXACTLY what Lowell was - both in his literary politics & his writing
itself - here's a sample quote:  "He was _the_ poet prepared, golem-like,
by the founders of New Criticism, programmed as it were to produce the
poems that would confirm for a contemporary audience that their _tastes_
(as honed by the curriculum of _Understanding Poetry_) could handle the
new poetry as readily as the old."
This is just one quote among MANY.  And he handles the Vendler wax
very similarly.  But it's a complex book - he molds the wax on all sides
at various places presenting Lowell as uncannily "self-fashioned" and at
other places as the puppet; he lambasts New Criticism but praises it for
bring poetry per se front & center; his final section dealing with what
he characterizes (following Virilio & others) society as a state of
total & unacknowledged war, and arguing that mass corporate media
technology has utterly debased the public sphere - his final section
is a jeremiad which sounds strangely like the attacks the Fugitive New
Critics made 50 years before on industrial modernity.

As far as the Wax Museum metaphor, I don't think you can discount it as
mere metaphor, since the total-suspicion critique permeates this analysis
in the later part of the book.  His evocation of the power of war, its
deep connection with communication technologies, and the effect of all this
on public & cultural life especially in the US, is very powerful: it seems
"dated", but the frightening thing is that this datedness seems an integral
aspect of the US as a whole - this is the wax-museum-preservation effect.
It's a good monster movie - the US public as zombie-fodder of their
television screens & day jobs.

Nevertheless I still finally read it as a partial melodrama.  The public sphere
 is changing fast, becoming more internationalized & contentious at the same
time; what art & poetry have to offer is not a "take-over" of those mass
instruments of control but an international imaginative reconstruction of
social relations, which comes from the mass rather than the mass media.

As with a lot of these historical studies, the latter more contemporary
sections seem more rushed & disappointing - this is probably a wax effect
too.  I found a lot of special pleading for language poetry, but curiously,
in the context of the "total war" era theme, & the evocation of so much
social waste & despair as its outcome, I was more impressed by one line (70s)
from Robert Bly as an example of political-poetic reality than the whole
fanfare for what language poetry was supposedly doing.  the line was:
"We all feel like tires being run down roads under heavy cars".  For all
the special pleading about language poetry's 1-2 punch of theory & practice,
what seems missing is the fusion of the two in a yes resonant speech.

Dear poetics, maybe some teachers among you could help out here.  Do I

Dear Prof. Gould,

I have been searching the internet trying to find information on
teaching poetry to secondary school students and fell upon you website.
I am a student of Brown University and presently working in paris as an
intern for UNESCO in the department of secondary education.
I am trying to get underway a network for teachers of poetry via the
internet in order for them to have a forum where they could exchange
teaching methodologies; I was wondering if you had any information that
could help me in this endeavor.  It is to be an international project
that will encompas as many countries and cultures as possible that can
act as a resource to teachers of poetry. The idea is to promote the
teaching of poetry to high school aged students in a more analytical and
interesting way than has been traditionally taught.
If you know of any webisite, organization, group, ect., who could be of
use to me could you let me know ASAP.  I thank you in advance for your
time and consideration.

Sincerely,
Christine Bustany

Henry, or Hank, or buddy--whatever:

You have read poetry widely. You love to talk about it. You have a high
level of sophistication in discussing it. You have a sense of humor
discussing it. You feel comfortable bringing theory into the discussion too,
but do not allow it to eclipse the "primary text." You refrain from
employing the careful academic buzzwords that often litter poetic
"discourse." You are usually bullshit-free. You're not afraid of looking
like an ass. (Not at all.) In fact, listening to you talk about poetry makes
me often want to seek out new work I haven't yet read. You make me feel like
I have a lot of work to do but don't make me feel like an idiot for feeling
so. And you have nothing really to gain from any of this. Therefore, I find
it astounding that Christine Bustany, or any student, or any person, could
mistake you for a university professor.

Hope to see you this weekend.

No, I have to strongly disagree with Todd's opinions about Beyond Baroque.
Los Angeles is perhaps one of the most unique cities in the world.  It is
not New York, it is not San Francisco. It's Los Angeles.  And one can't
just complain about its city in comparison to other cities. Each place has
its unique history, etc.  For its mental and aesthethic landscape Beyond
Baroque is very important on many levels.  And yes the Los Angeles Poetery
Festival is pop and so what?  I think there's room for both types (and
more) poetics in whatever disguise it chooses itself in.  Personally I am
not that interested in that type of poetry, but they do manage to organize
themselves in a professional matter and give an audience a show.  Pop
always draw a big crowd.  Everything else is small,dark, mysterious,
beautiful, etc.

In regards to Todd's commentary on Beyond Baroque's board:  It had many
visual artists as well as poets/writers, etc.  Generally visual artists are
interested in the literary field.  Many of them go to readings more than
writers.  Ask why, but I don't know the reason.  Perhaps they're more
curious. Besides schools like Cal-arts really encourage the mixture of
reading, visual arts and writing in their programs.  And that schooling has
really affected Beyond Baroque in a very positive light.  As we speak I
believe there are now only writers on the board at beyond baroque.  So
things change as they should.

I also want to comment that if you look at a regular calendar of Beyond
Baroque there are so many type of things happening on it - that it doesn't
really support one type of school of writing.  For example I know they will
be having a Todd  reading there shortly - and he has read there many times
in the past.

As for the darkness of the place...  well for me it is a technique to focus
what is happening on the stage -like cinema.  As for its reputation, I find
most people involved with Beyond Baroque were treated really well - artists
and audience.  At least that's what they told me and Benjamin.

And the struggle to keep a place like Beyond Baroque open is an ongoing
battle.  It has nothing to do with poetics, but more with the importance of
all aspects of writing. Again culture itself is on attack.  And I am
talking about all forms of culture.  If you are a director at beyond
baroque you are working 10 to 12 (and more) hours a day without great pay,
and the hardest part of that job is keeping that place open.  It is a very
difficult job.

I am writing this post in haste, so excuse me for the lack of wit,etc.
ciao,

        Don't feel bad, Henry, look at the title I got! I was going to
forward her to the list, but was gentlemanly enough to ask her first. Now
it's moot, so I'll do it, with my reply. I do think those who can should
help--although I'm not sure I see "analytical=interesting." ( p.s. I'm no
Prof. either) S.

Tosh: I wasn't attacking anything. It does seem an Agelino thing to
defend this city when not necessary. I was comparing other cities
because there are things going on there that promote dialogue and the
communtiy of poetics. I'm afraid LA doesn't! Ocasionally there are great
thing--The Italians reading here was marvelous--but really the same
faces showed up for them as for anyone else--yes yes I can hear you
sigh--but I was there too--I simply would like to see the boundaries
broken down more. THE LA FEST. scence has funding--but the people that
go there go for entertainment--the festitival renounces by not including
such amazing LA poets as Fanny Howe and Diane Ward--because they "don't
fit in". I sat on a panel years ago of "Language Writers" along with
Fanny, Doug, Paul, and Bob Crosson! THis wasn't proper but we did it!
Fanny was the only one that cold claim to be involved with Language
writing historically--but the director of the series didn't know what
was what--she even admited that in front of the audience--and asked "Can
we learn what this writing is about--it hardly ever makes any sense---!
" And that was the last time the "Fest" did anything out of the
ordinary! This city is famous for Chares Buk.'s poetry--not the wondrous
avante guarde tradition it USED to have!

THat I will continue to bemoan as the pets I know that reside here get
pushed aside for more "mainstream" poetics. THAT is truly an LA profile.
Look at the LA Times! THe times--our 'offical' rag--has a policy of NOT
publishing reviews of works by local poets! Not local fiction
writiers--only local poets! Once a week they publish the likes of
Carolyn Force and such--but they won't even mention their own poets!
THAT's why I bemoan--loudly--the state of affirs--and no one can truly
think this a vibrant poetics community! I've had friends move in the
past year who need to be able to weekly go to readings and lectures--and
they didn't find them here--and boy--they tried!

Oh well. I am obvously saying this because I will not give up! And
yes--I will read there and "there" even while I bemoan the "no
thereness" of the place.

Yes, Poets & Writers is terrific to find out which student of whom won
what prize, and to find out which prizes are about to be given out to
which people from where, or how to sign a book, but if you want
information about teaching writing and reading to K-12 students (or
college, for that matter), you more likely want to talk to Teachers &
Writers.

I don't want to single out Rasula either, who I think is very smart, but I
do feel like saying that that argument about Lowell as New Critical puppet
is tired, tired, tired.  Say what you want about the guy, but that ole
take is goofy: based on essentially one book - LWC - that Lowell wrote
when he was in his mid-twenties.  The fact is that Lowell has too severely
capricious as a result of basically unmonitored bi-polar ilness to be a
very convenient puppet for anyone.  And his work post-Life Studies annoyed
the hell out of most New Critics and was admired - albeit with some
reservations by Ginsburg, Duncan and other very non-New Critics.  WC
Williams loved Life Studies.  And in contrast, New Critic Allen Tate told
Lowell, "*all* the poems about your family, including the one about you
and Elizabeth, are definitely *bad*.  I do not think you ought to publish
them...the poems are composed of unassimilated details...The free verse,
arbitrary and without rhythm reflects a lack of imaginative focus."
Square this with Rasula's arguments if you like, but you'll be doing a lot
of tap-dancing.  I have plenty of critical things to say about Lowell's
poetry, but a puppet he was not.   -m.

Todd, Maria, et al:
I didn't mean to imply lack of influence. Rather, the influence is quite
varied and not necessarily corresponding directly to the public image of the
program. And the influence goes beyond the program itself. For instance, I've
been influenced greatly  by Anselm Hollo -- but also influenced by Rachel
Levitsky, whose work is very different from what one might consider the
Naropa canon. And my experience may not be representative. By the time one
gets to grad school, I hope, one has learned to glean what one wants to from
a situation, rather than simply ingesting and regurgitating. I'm sure my
influences elsewhere would have been equally different and unpredictable.
Maybe someone could get a grant to attend graduate writing programs at
numerous schools and document the effects on their own writing :-{)

Well Henry,

i know where ya stand vis-a-vis that group (which isn't a group, in any
meaningful sense, in contemporary rhetoric and baiting...so i refuse to
use "their" L name)........

"Special pleading"??  No i don't think so.  But i know how you folks with
a narrower interest in form-structures go out of your way to carry out
"special bashing"!! (Thus my public stance, that the "L" name belong
mostly to y'all on the contra-L barricades, and isn't really useful to
folks who are actually *reading* the stuff....)

So, no, i think JR is quite fair and certainly doesn't engage in "special
pleading"..

Your riposte about Lowell appears on the face of it more convincing.  I'm
willing to grant you that round, in a sense, because the very
highly-charged (but very accurate) languange JR uses does indeed justify
the term you used in paraphrasing him...I still think he doesn't mean to
say, that Lowell was a puppet, as i understand the term..Only in the sense
that say Reagan (not the world's most lucid or functional human being) was
a "puppet" for other forces.  If so, Ronnie was a very *powerful* puppet,
and had and used real volition to initiate real evil..In a similar way, i
think JR reads Lowell as able to rise to the po-world heights becasue
various things about him made him the perfect embodiment of NewCrit
values..But once near the heights, he had his own impact on the poetry
world, and certainly achieved the sccess and fame he very much craved;  in
that sense, he was (and i think in JR's eyes was) an autonomous actor out
to get things for himself..and (like the great Rondini) he got 'em.  In
that sense i stand by my original point that JR's reading of RL does not
really reduce the latter to a "puppet."

The apparent abuse is not intended for anyone on this list (that I am
aware), out of the context of the smiling-good-time-fun for which I am
re-nouned.

Altho, I reserve the right to contradict myself at a moment's notice.

In regards to Todd's statement, basically this is a complaint I hear from
all of the poets in L.A.  Everyone feels displaced here.  Personally I like
that feeling!  Very Nat West!!

Los Angeles is not about dialogue.  It is about action and promotion.  And
one can't be angry at the L.A. Fest.  They are what they are!  Imagine a
poetry conference in Las Vegas.  Well L.A. is not that far off.  Plus
poetry will always be small compared to other arts.  This is neither a good
or bad thing.  Yes the same faces show up at the readings.  But they are
nice faces!  And L.A. is not really a community except for the movie biz...
and of course various gangs, art dealers, and lonely ex & current Art
Directors for non-profit org.

Mark, the Lowell puppet or not-puppet issue is not that interesting in itself;
I pointed it out as an example of what seemed more questionable about WAX,
which is, for a lack of a better phrase coming to me, the "total suspicion"
theory of social reality; Lowell is a puppet because EVERYTHING is under
a form of "control", and the State is ONLY a form of control.  My view is the
state is a form of organization, that moving from monarchy to democracy was
an advance, that those who fought for democracy didn't die in vain, that there
is a long way to go - and Rasula's critique of war, manipulation, and
conformity is a step forward - but to say government is pure malevolence
and control, and that therefore culture, museums, poems, and people
fall like puppet-dominoes - well, I say that's stretching it.  It's like
what I said about his "diorama" effect in his own museum : location is
everything; if you can show how the whole culture is duped by evil
forces of control then your heroes in the alternative poetry world
only seem more heroic; and as I tried to point out I think Rasula
really shows how great that resistant tradition is!!  But I am here to
remind that the left and its poets is capable of distortion and
mental blinders too, of demeaning and belittling what they don't
understand; and that the most desolate cultures are those built on
fantasies of victory over the "enemy" actually being FULFILLED -
with all the littered corpses of the vanquished foe lying about
under the monuments whose languages they can no longer decipher.

RE: Moving Borders:

Todd you're right.  Neidecker's poem is GREAT & "major" & certainly
gave me cause to refigure her place in my mental lit history.  I'm still
not sure she "belongs" in the anthology to the exclusion of other
"forgotten women" (Kyger?  I don't have the anth with me but I think she
might've been left out).  Any sort of lineage -- the sort histories and
anthologies try to construct -- is necessarily problematic. I know
Margy Sloan must've struggled and she does
make a compelling case for her inclusion.  I'm just glad Neidecker's in
though, I'm not complaining.  (Maybe this is an "uncritical" typically 2nd
wave feminist response -- just being *glad* for more women writers -- and
am I oldfashioned/we're *beyond* that? The fact that this text is just now
recovered, after Neidecker's resuscitation several years ago, seems to
suggest the contrary.)

I do think MB is sort of the come-lately Allen's New American Poetryesque
come-uppance long overdue yet timely nonetheless.  It probably couldn't
have been done so wonderfully volumnuously at a previous date.  (and your
prompt, Todd, is long overdue too.  Thanks for bringing it up!)

But what I found Most Compelling was the "statements of Poetics" section
(as Don Allen called it in his anthology).  I'd come across a lot of
poetry by most of these poets (thanks by and large I must say to Peter
Gannick -- many of those included are widely published, but many others
are primarily potes & poets poets -- Diane Ward, Jean Day, Maureen Owen --
or at least p&p has made them more accessible).  I wish there were more
"statements"!  Here was an opportunity to read "poetics" by many who'd
written such things for say Poetics Journal or In The American Tree -- but
otherwise hard to find.  Encountering Carla Harryman and Tina Darragh, for
example  -- again two whose poetry (plays etc) I knew -- was and is a
thrill.

You're right--ok then--here's question: dumb as it sounds: why would one
get a degree in Poetics? Against ALL odds I've formed a teaching
career--but Robert Duncan used to say--"you're not getting a job out of
this..." and so--aside from th knowledge--aside from the study--why a
degreed program? Black Mountain--while degreed--turnd out few "degreed"
writers--but they did not care!

yes--margy did work hard! almost to the exclusion--NO--to the exclusion
of all else in her life. She said in her statement exactly why there are
folks there and some folks not--and the Neidecker piece seems to be
explained beautifully. No, we not beyond any discussion that continues
to be one. Lately all sorts of news on the radio (KPFK here) about
post-feminist ideologies and--to my mind--we need more more more! The
entire thing (and I live in a "hip-hyped city") about  RETRO crap from
the seventies that mostly benefit men: strip
joints--martinis--cigars--steaks--causes me to URP and feel as if all
the work done prior has falled into NOWHERE. These "kids" and their dang
styles--don't they know they'll die from 'em? --my parents did! . But
seriously--I am certain that this anthology came out at specifically the
most important time. I urge everyone to buy it.

Margy deserves the biggest applause. Yes, other anthologies are out
there--but I deny anyone to find one with this gaze--this field of
force.

i dunno---

Quite a few people have posted on the list about Rasula's book in the last
two years; very few of us saw in the book what you see (that's my
impression); ....

In a way it sounds much more exciting and interesting, in your reading,
than the book i remember...

How about other folks who have read Rasula's Wax Museum?  Do you-all agree
with Henry that it is characterized by "total suspicion" as a theory of
social reality?  That it's paranoid about the State as a force of
control??

Lurid and compelling terms.  Much as i loved the book, i don't recall it's
being **that** interesting!

>>Todd you're right.  Niedecker's poem is GREAT & "major" & certainly

One of the things I'm liking about the new Spicer bio is the way it shows
Kyger as poet and participant in a blossoming poetry scene--a fuller sense of
her, not just as "Gary Snyder's wife" (or "ex" etc.)
& thus, by extension, the SF/Berkeley renaissance as about more than just its
famous men. Helen Adam also gets a fuller treatment than she has elsewhere.

i think it's always at risk mr barron. that's the fun part of it. tho i think
i recognize the situation you're describing. group thingness that has no
permeable boundaries. i found this situation when i lived in nyc. ear inn
people would not go to newyorican, poetry project people would not go to
segue, etc etc. and then you could easily map the people who wouldn't go
certain places with the way they wrote. ie. they wrote in ONE rather, as blake
would have it, newtonian way.

but then also you would run into the more gregarious types who would go to
everything, yet still somehow maintain a close circle of friends and "some"
kind of approach to poetry that was unique to who they were. i guess i mean
their poetry had a sense of honesty and diversity. as easy as it is to leave
d. rothschild out of anthologies and dismiss him as a crank who doesn't know
the english language, he is one of these. i salute his various field.

Hm. This gets really personal, so I'll speak for myself. This also relates to the
various poetry and money threads of the recent past, does it not?

I went to music school and then poetics. Neither time did I expect a career to
arise directly from the education. I think education solely as a means to a job,
while practically unavoidable today, is a recent concept, springing from education
no longer being available only to the financial/social/cultural elite. Maybe my
path marks me as an elitist?

At any rate, music was even worse, because it's so demanding (time, energy,
presentable attire, instrument, sheet music, etc.) and when one works in the field,
it's usually demeaning (bad music, disrespect, etc.). At least with poetry, one can
write late at night and the neighbors don't complain. And the tools are a lot
cheaper.

So, why go to school? I did it because it was a way to focus for 2 years on my
writing, and take my own work more seriously. A friend once said "I bought 2 years
to write." Also, and more to the point, I had a blast. This was fun. I got to read
and write and call it work. I once had a roommate who collected "useless degrees"
-- he had an MA in theology and was working on one in psychology. He was a lot of
fun to talk to, and he made a living as a carpenter.

Didn't Michael Davidson give Kyger quite a lot of respectful attention in
her own right, in his book, the San Fancisco Renaissance??

It has been some years since i read it, may or may not be recalling it

I would say tho--that the "fun" I'm afraid is not truly fun for the
aesthetic and principal of the politic--that said--I spend many years in
Show Business--and cruelty never formed--nor did borders there--any work
to be pursued--only to be conquered.

Subject:      poetics and l.a. -Reply

somebody wrote, and my system here doesn't identify everyone very
well, so sorry, somebody, but as follows:
\
"In regards to Todd's statement, basically this is a complaint I hear from
all of the poets in L.A.  Everyone feels displaced here.  Personally I like
that feeling!  Very Nat West!!

Los Angeles is not about dialogue.  It is about action and promotion.  And
one can't be angry at the L.A. Fest.  They are what they are!  Imagine a
poetry conference in Las Vegas.  Well L.A. is not that far off.  Plus
poetry will always be small compared to other arts.  This is neither a
good
or bad thing.  Yes the same faces show up at the readings."

to which i must add (if douglas messerli hasn't already weighed in here)
that l.a. is the center of avant-garde publishing in america. sun & moon is
doing 50 books a year (50 BOOKS A YEAR!), with an interest mainly in
getting these books into print, as published objects (of which one, i have
to say, is mime). other small presses, understandably, take another tack,
trying to publish many, many fewer books and publishing them with more
attention, perhaps, while douglas, it seems to me, is commited to getting
these books into the public world, where they can live and be found by
those so motivated.

now, to hear people complaining about the scene out there, being too
intimate and not public enough, or, on the other hand, that it is all about
"action and promotion" : i wonder what in the hell people want. Douglas
is getting the work done, at great risk and with tremendous toil, not to
mention the joy that he will telll you about if you happen to talk to him. He
is doing his salon, it is ongoing, it is tireless, and so, it seems, is he;
whoever is doing the "action and promotion" that is complained about,
well i don''t know. But let's be clear: the avant-garde, risk-taking  major
publisher of innovative work, in translation, third world and otherwise is
on Wilshire Blvd. And you can go there to hear work and talk and have a
wine.  Or two. What was the LA poetry scene, perhaps someone can
say, when S&M was in College Park, Md. something mighty less, I would
guess.

Mark P., should have been more clear, I didn't mean in *that* book, which
is quite fine, but more in a nebulous "popular concept" or less thorough
print sources--no diss on anyone else was intended, just kudos for the
presentation of women writers and artists in the Spicer bio.

to tell you the truth this whole discussion makes me feel so much better
because often after a poetry evening where eight-twelve people attend i go
home telling myself billy why do you even bother. then i think of far off
hollywood where all the millionaires, speilberg, stallone, woody allen,
coppola, shirley mclaine, lina wertmuller, max von sydow, arnold, they've
all got a poet or two on the payroll, one for the limo and one for the
poolside, i'd be a poolside poet, lighting the cigars of sly's girlfriends,
reciting the communist poems of Pasolini in the original Italian. I've
heard it was becoming a trend in other cities, if you dined in Le Cirque
you just had to have a poet or you didn't rate. the attorney general it is
rumored is looking into putting a poet or two on the payroll, just because
we work for the government doesn't mean we aren't millionaires he jested,
and millionaires must have poets or whats a million mean. maybe defense and
health will follow and establish rival poets in their baileywickes, the FBI
poet will write poems in bulletholes and the cia poet in blood shipped
fresh daily. Milosz @ Pentagon! Ackermann @ Environment! Forche@state! Mark
my words there's going to be lots of jobs for poets, so study hard boys and
girls and learn a second language.

Billy understands the business of poetry like no one.  And one who lives in
Los Angeles, he's got the poet's life down pat.  Oh by the way, has anyone

"Identification thus eliminates time from the account of cause and
effect. All questions about the simultaneity or succesion of cause and
effect disappear, for time really means nothing at all in a rational
account of the world. The timelessness of the logical necessity which we
have already noted in deductive systems is here once more. The effect is
the explication of the cause; it is the revelation of the implication of
the cause. The mere unfolding of history is as unfruitful in enrichment
of that earlier cause as is the process of inference with respect to
implication of the cause. The range of being which we call "the actual,"
which is never apart from time, is explained by identification, which
eliminates time entirely from the account. And thus again the crucial
problem which occupies us appears: How can the permanent be
significantly employed in an account of the changing?
Meyerson pushes his investigation of the identifying tendency of reason
in science to a stage beyond this. Not only does rational explaining
ultimately eliminate time; it finally eliminates qualitative diversity
and leaves us with bare homogeneous space."---from Explanation and
Reality in the Philosophy of Emile Meyerson by Thomas R. Kelly---Carlo
Parcelli---(These quotes are supplied by Carlo Parcelli and not R.
Gancie who is innocent in the whole matter.)

Difficult and Delicate Matter


Well, I have a good deal of diary material from Kathy Acker, 1974 and
earlier; some of it is in the form of letters or texts directly to me,
and some of it is revised carbon copy, and some of it is mimeograph.
None of this has been published. So I write to someone I know who writes
to someone he knows and finds out I cannot in fact quote from the words
of the diary, which belong to the estate of Kathy Acker, although I can
paraphrase the words which she has written.

But then, who can check up to make sure I am paraphrasing accurately?
For example, if I write, that Kathy says on March 1, 1974, that she
wishes me dead, then I am writing a fabrication; there is no such state-
ment. Which is not to say that Kathy did not wish me dead on that date -
only that I do not have such material in my possession.

What Kathy does say is that I am her father and she wants to experiment
to see how close she can get to me. She also states that I help her, al-
though later I am sure she would not have felt this way. But what are
these statements, in light of the fact that they are neither quotations
nor content that you may ascertain for yourself?

To be sure, if you visit me in Brooklyn, then I might deign to show you
the original material, and you could decide for yourself, providing I
did not fabricate such as well - forging a signature, duplicating, etc.,
from texts I composed for whatever reason.

Kathy says she doesn't understand who she is and doesn't understand a
lot of my writing, and I wonder, would she understand this text and ap-
prove of it? It is easy to circumscribe, literally, the dead, who are
given and given up without recourse; mourning is a moment astride the
real, returning the world to itself, and these textual gifts back to a
present life, harboring and framing the past.

But this is not about mourning. Kathy says I understand everything she
writes and that she understands what I say directly to her. She says she
feels as if we're twins joined together, as if I'm protecting her. She
continues speaking about power, about my taking power from her, which
later became an issue between us, appearing later in the videos we did
together (and within what jurisdiction are those spoken words now, as
well as those words written on the screen, as well as those unspoken
words in her eyes?).

She ends this particular section by saying she doesn't want parents, and
wants to know what's happening. She's remembering, and describes a white
shawl and a red-brown dress, blankets. Then there is half a page of
blank space, and she's into a second, carbon-copied part, about Peter,
with a different title as well. Could I quote the different title? I
would choose not to, insisting on paraphrase.

Kathy was trying to map out her consciousness; _she says so, in so many
words._ I attempt to interface with virtual subjects, dreams, ghosts,
machines, mournings, technologies, internets, those moments of syncope
described by Clement in Syncope, holding itself back in the throat.
"temporary loss of consciousness from fall of blood-pressure," and I
feel comfortable quoting from the living Concise Oxford; so many texts
begin with dictionary definitions, and this one ends with one.

The argument about Lowell begin a puppet of the new criticism goes back to
Perloff's _The Poetics of Indeterminacy_; there is a nice demonstration of
the way in which the early Lowell seeds his work with symbols and
paradoxes in anticipation of New Critical classroom exegesis. Of course,
calling him a puppet is rather crude--isn't it more of a convergence of
interests?  The New Critics might be Lowell's puppets just as plausibly.

The Rasula analysis of Lowell is devastating and for me irrefutable; this
does not mean that Lowell does not transcend his "institutional" role
within the wax museum, but I am not the person to ask since my aversion to
Lowell's work is tempermental and visceral. I realize he is hugely
accomplished and great in his own way--I just can't stand him.

It seems to me that if place is the problem, it should be simple enough to
invade some den of mediocrity.  It seems to me that Sun & Moon and Cal Arts
have begun a pretty effective invasion of LACMA.  What about MOCA?  What about
the science museum with the 50 foot woman in it?

The "Buk. School" is ABOUT self promotion.  The performance poets are also
_everywhere_.  Incommunicado and Manic D and 2.13.61 have done good music
industry-style promotion for lit. (as well as celebrity publishing, but well).

I think of all the celebs writing books now.  By and large, they seem to read
at either their local independent bookstore or local B&N rather than do a tour
of shopping malls or record stores or whatever. It is a bid for legitimacy.
Where promotion is work, to not promote may seem genuine.

Maybe it's not so bad to be here!  If you really suck, they'll throw a lot of

Hear hear. Enough of these posting on the post-whatever drivel.  Let's
bring back normative syntax, there's something that never gets

The latest news of work completed here at the Blake Archive. Apologies for
cross-posting. Please forward as appropriate. Matt K.

--

The editors of the William Blake Archive
<http://www.iath.virginia.edu/blake> are pleased to announce the publication
of six new electronic editions of Blake's illuminated books. They are:

_All Religions are One_ copy A
_There is No Natural Religion_ copies B, C, G, and L
_Milton, a Poem_ copy C

Composed and executed in 1788, _All Religions are One_ and _There is No
Natural Religion_ are Blake's first works in illuminated printing, though no
copy of either work survives from this date. The ten plates of _All
Religions_ were followed quickly by twenty _No Natural Religion_ plates in
two antithetical sets (a and b series). Only one copy of _All Religions_ is
extant, now in the Huntington Library, printed c. 1795 with and in the same
style as _There is No Natural Religion_ copy L, the only copy consisting
exclusively of the ten b-series of plates, now in The Pierpont Morgan
Library. The other twelve recorded copies of this book consist of a
mixture of the same eight to twelve plates, which appeared to be merely
incomplete sets of proofs until it was discovered that six of these copies
were 19th-century reproductions. Once the inauthentic impressions were
weeded out, it became apparent that what remained was Blake's selection of a
and b plates for an abridged version of the work printed around 1794. We
present copies B, C, and G of this twelve-plate work, now in the collections
of the Yale Center for British Art, Library of Congress, and The Pierpont
Morgan Library, respectively.

There are only four copies of _Milton_, Blake's most personal epic. Copy C,
from the New York Public Library, was Blake's own copy. Printed c. 1811, it
was later reconfigured and renumbered by Blake when he inserted extra
plates, which he appears to have done on at least two different occasions.

All of these editions have newly edited texts and are all fully searchable
for both text and images and supported by the unique Inote and ImageSizer
applications described in our previous updates.

We now have twenty-two copies of thirteen illuminated books. Over this and
next year, we will be adding Blake's last illuminated works, _On Homers
Poetry [&] On Virgil_, _The Ghost of Abel_, and _Laocoon_, as well as
_Milton_ copy D  and _Jerusalem_ copy E. We will also be adding at least six
more copies of _Songs of Innocence and of Experience_, two copies of _Songs
of Innocence_, five copies of _The Marriage of Heaven and Hell_, four copies
of _The Book of Urizen_, and two copies each of _America, a Prophecy_ and
_Europe, a Prophecy_. In addition, work continues on the SGML edition of
David V. Erdman's _Complete Poetry and Prose of William Blake_.

We will continue to post updates on various lists every few months, but
readers interested in the progress of the Archive can subscribe to our
Blake Update list, which can be found on the Archive's Contents Page. On
this page readers will also find that we have opened the top level of the
Contributing Institutions Page, which provides contact information and links
to institutions participating in the Archive. In the coming months, we plan
to include color-coded and linked lists of each institution's entire Blake
collection to indicate what is and is not in the Archive and what is
forthcoming.

I think that "infiltration" and subversion is a good idea--but I
disagree that Sun and Moon has done so outside of the bookstore that
they run. LACMA has a pretty narrative and non-innovational
series--Laurel Ann Bogen is running it and she has nothing to do with
Sun and Moon--nor--do I think )(know) she reads outside of a linear
school.  THe "stars" I refered top certainly have a right (and several
ornamental lefts) but they read at a series that for years has been
sponsered by the ever conservation Poetry of America Foundation--at the
Chateau Marmont (the hip place for a martini!) and so I'm afraid they
don't really count. (Of course--there's room for all--I'm turning sweet
now) BUT

No one will throw alot of monet at innovational writers--LA has a rich
history of the avante-guarde but not a funded a.g. ! Ribot, Remap, Witz,
Rhizome, and the poets reflected in those
experiemental**conte,porary**innovation based magazines don't care to
publish in Ploughshares/etc--cuz that's not our readership. THose
magazines--like the New Yorker--have an investment in narrativity that
describes (As Roberts Peters once beautifully stated) the season
depicted on the cover!

It's not so "bad" here--but--I, broken "record"
dismiss the idea that complaining is a negative thing. While other
cities support symposums and conferences (well, not the city itself) we
can't fathom anything outside of the BOOK FAIR (promotion) at UCLA and
the Poetry Fest. We need to learn to expand this here horizon--I, a
citizien of this berg--publish here and want to see the daily sunrise
reflect more than the sorrid details of one's "self" as reflected in the
poems of complaint! Rememeber,

Huxley
Yeats
Isherwood
Cage
Mann
Fitzgerald
Duncan, I

ALL complained and worked here

not to mention the poets
such as Doug Messerli, Dennis Phillips, Martha Ronk, Diane Ward,
(myself), Paul Vangelisti, Guy Bennett, Fanny Howe, etc

still do!

Dear Tosh I just want to second the general feeling of love for LA as is--
I will mention some things that affected my writing while living there
rather briefly in early 90s-- looking at those midcentury architect's
buildings, like Neutra, etc--- browsing for ages at BB and S/M--- knowing
some people who could actually make a living writing, albeit for the screen
-- and I know that last one is really Uncool -- plus, just sitting in those
chairs having drinks at LACMA, looking around MOCA --- and the grid of
streets over landscape-- it inspired me.

x from No-cal,
Eliz.

ps the professors at CAL-ARTS were nothing but friendly to me in several
brief mtgs as the sister of one of their students -- also, they did a 6
person TANGO in honor of their students at graduation!! oh was I jealous --
professors at SFState don't even attend graduation.

These questions of audience are so difficult -- I've struggled with them,
in terms of people attending readings and poetics talks, for parts of the
last 18 years. Here in Tucson, our audiences, and I'm thinking of various
events and series from about 1986 to the present, have ranged widely.
Because there is a university here, and a lot of poetry students at that
university, we have been able to get 75 people to certain Chax Press or
POG-sponsored events in the past. But we've also had our share of events
with ten people or less. When our audiences are more than 20, I think that
half or more of those audiences are in some way associated with the
University of Arizona. When 20 or less, that's not so true. Why does there
continue to be great variance in attendance?  Is Leslie Scalapino really
that much better known than Steve McCaffery? Or Bob Perelman than Michael
Davidson? Does it depend on the weather? On quirks of scheduling? I'm sure
these audience issues, which in some ways are community-building issues,
will continue to bug me -- but I also try to keep the attitude that it's
the people there, no matter their numbers, that count, and that allow us
(POG these days) to continue presenting such events.

I haven't noticed that there's a lot of 'popular' audience for alternative
poetics even in SF or NYC, although there is the ability to draw 25 or more
people, most of the time -- although, as some have pointed out, and as I've
witnessed, not all the time. I've read to one of my largest audiences in
Tuscaloosa, Alabama. I tend to think, at this time, that it's something of
a myth that the audience or production centers for innovative writing are
NY and SF -- although those are certainly important points on the map.

This is Kevin Killian.  Mark, you're 100% right, and even better than
Michael's version of Kyger is his reading of Helen Adam.  Honestly I think
it must have been the first account of her work to take it seriously and to
place it into the context of the currents from which, at first glance, she
and her work seem so distant.  [Michael Davidson, "The San Francisco
Renaissance: Poetics and Community at Mid-century" (Cambridge Univ. Press,
1989)]  Gwyn, thank you for your kind words about the book Lew Ellingham
and I have written on Spicer "Poet Be Like God".  Where I disagreed with
Michael D is in his underlying thesis, I don't think it's ever stated
explicitly, that Spicer's fears of women and their sexuality precluded him
and his circle from supporting and engaging in the work of the women poets
of the period, and also the great female modernists of the 20th century
that preceded his own work.  Michael and I were both lucky in that Kyger's
papers are so marvelously available to the public at the grand Archive for
New Poetry at UCSD, they are a great collection and make her life in the
50s and 60s a total open book; lucky also that she is still alive and among
us and so helpful to researchers and critics and biographers.  In the case
of Adam, whose papers are at Buffalo, I expect wonderful things from the
work that Kristin Prevallet has been conducting on her the past few years.
And there's a biography being written about Ruth Witt-Diamant, the
impresario of the SF State Poetry Center, whose career Lew and I sketch out
in "Poet Be Like God."  The strangest case of "forgotten women" in the
Spicer crowd is that of Jamie MacInnis, the super-talented San
Francisco-born poet with whom Spicer became acquainted in his final years.
She lived on after him and continued to write some stunning poems, but
nobody now knows where she is or even if she's alive or dead!

Thias is more for Henry but I'll use this chance.  I may have it wrong but
I think in a recent post on the wax museum you said that essentially nothing
muchh changes in the realm of poetics (i.e. good guys and establishment, good
women vs. the establishment).  This hit me especially hard for some reason -
maybe because I've been an 'anti' for a long time.  Taken with the ironic and
profound gesture of the 80 yr late funeral (with it's reawakening for me the
temporal coincidence ?co-happening? ?co-habiting? with zaum, futurism,
war, revolution, Trotskii, constructivism, productivism, etcetc of eighty
years ago.  Has anything changed or are we stuck in these conflicts
indefinitely/

Regarding the discussion of audience size (Mark DuCharme, Charles
Alexander and others):  Jack Spicer's now historic lectures at Vancouver,
which I've just been reading in Peter Gizzi's THE HOUSE THAT JACK BUILT,
is good evidence that the size of the crowd at a reading or lecture is
little indication of its eventual influence.  There were perhaps 30 people
in attendance in Warren and Ellen Tallman's living room.

I was one of three poets reading in Elizabeth Robinson's Berkeley house
this month, on a Sunday afternoon.  Perhaps 40 people were there.  It was
one of the best reading experiences I've had--a perfect sense of attention
in the room for all three poets.  Salon settings are just the best.  Only
Allen Ginsberg and slam tournaments fill larger halls anyway, and few
poets are up to that harsh glare, thank god.

Best,
Paul Hoover

This is your local poetics list manager reporting to you live from
Buffalo, New York, where the dew point is high enough to make your
computer sweat all its bells & whistles into an organic mush so lush that
even roaches will chow down on your motherboard's main wires.
But enough of the "bug" motif. Seems like I'm obsessed with pests and the
nasty business of either letting those flies crawl all over me or
resorting to the dragonslayer napalm-equivalent in the ant's world (so
much for those damn centaurians!) but enough metaphor!

some facts:

I logged in for the first time in a day and saw that the nasty business of
UB's changeover to the "IMAP" method of mail delivery (which I know nearly
nothing about) is finally over. There were nearly 100 messages to the
Poetics List's custodial address: poetics@acsu.buffalo.edu -- the most
messages in a long time (besides the now ubiquitous error messages).

No one from UB was able to send or receive messages until Thursday and
stored-up mail was still being delivered yesterday and even today.

Sorry if this delay prevented me from signing people up to the list in a
timely manner.

For those newbies to the list, welcome! If you have any questions, or
would like to pummel me with your poetical criticisms, please write to me
directly at kuszai@acsu.buffalo.edu

Thanks for your patience -

I also want to mention in regards to size, that the Beyond Baroque room
never seems empty.  Besides programming I have read there myself, and when
I read in a group reading of course it's packed.  But I also read in that
room with 20 or less people and it is still an enjoyable event.  So the
room itself has lot to do with the reading as will as the work and the size
of the crowd.

Alan --

The Boston Alternative Poetry conference still in progress  at Blacksmith
House, as I tap on these keys, is at fevery pitch, to coin a phrase.  Friday
kicked off with readings from Daniel Bouchard, Drew Gardner, Wil Alexander,
Fanny Howe.  Bouchard bounces off generic events, news wrap-ups, say, and apt
linkages such as those between game show evangelism and Mr. Clinton's recent
visit to the MIT computer labs.  Drew Gardner resuscitates (one of my favorite
words right now!) something verging on urban elegiac, thinking it through to
its after-Ashbery and unawful, sense-making matrices within angst in big
space.  Gardner knows something about cowboys and how they dress.  Wil
Alexander delivers fresh lines of defense for tropicalism north of Sunset and
Canal, variations on never saying anything you could not mean if you had the
time to stare for days at cawcaws, Lamantia lizards, stuff. He loves poesies
and shows it, and even better, talks it when he does his "prose" intros and so
forth.  Fanny Howe, who might be wearing sunglasses now, employs a term like
"soul" in polished ovular forms that cover no language we can understand
equivocally, tanning with HD. I want to pick through those ovals and spin them
in my right hand, Queeglike.

Sat.: vocabularies and imaginations panel -- missed this.  Biography/criticism
panel -- missed.  Missed the noontime reading too, but the buzz is that Gerrit
Lansing is a wonder, fully clothed in Boston haberdashery, Blackmountain tie.
(Will get details on this, later.)

Afternoon reading a Boston phenomenon that occurs every other generation.
Last time, perhaps, was during Hurricane Carol (or someone's) when John
Wieners swept into Charles Street Meetinghouse to attend his first ever poetry
gig, that : to hear Charles Olson read every poem he -- Charles, that is --
had written up to that point.  He read for hours and hours, and John and
poetry have never been the same.  (Two generations before that: Henry James
revised brother William's application to Harvard.)

Among the readers this Saturday afternoon:  Zhang Er reading in Mandarin and
Leonard Schwartz offering the crispest English versions.  John Taggart moaning
on the blues, repetition, feeding and leading, singing soft, singing
"precious," and the mother of it all, the blues, having her vision of how to
give it birth -- one that includes, I think, our hearing Taggart moaning
"preceeeeessuss" on. A genuine history and a poem performed as a piece!
Unstoppably first rate.  Chris Funkhouser also singing, bridegroom to his
skeleton, flooding the room with a sutra that is not a sutra from nowhere,
moving it gracefully on.  Caroline Knox tearing into writers' pretensions such
as, to paraphrase, "composing" a stark language framework and "going back" and
filling it with "content."   Knox got some of the biggest laughs, deservedly.
Sean Cole got lots of laughs too and a few cardiovascular molecules had to
have imploded -- someone's, somewhere -- at Cole's most astonishingly diverse
send-ups  -- Dickens, house plant life, teen lust, three-family crisscrossed
dreams, warped dials... well it's finely warped into a poetry and a poetic
presence not unlike his precursors, Ricard, O'Hara, Artaud. Rare.  Andrea
Brady stands as tall as you want while she rips your pea-brain (mine, anyway)
into smithereens, flowing, protoliterate incursions into inchoate bliss and
something opposite -- isn't this what we all need now?

The afternoon and the conference have been the greatest sort of success,
pairing the established with the not-quite-yet, just what a serious gathering
of poets should be.  The spotlight shines until late tonight.  More soon.
Call you soon,

to some extent the dynamics of who goes or doesnt go to what readings is
similar in towns of various sizes (from boulder to nyc).
here in portland (the western one) there are groups that go mostly to one
reading series, but its more the writers who attract the artist through
people they know (which has the corollary that the best method of publicity
is direct notification--phone or e-mail)
for example, while my own work is toward the edge, a lotta words without
standard sentencing (delivered energeticly)-- people who come to hear me
read come coz of their connections with me and my work; but most of these
people would probably not go to see barret watten or lyn hejinian. (any out
of town writer without some sort of local rep has difficulty pulling an
audience.)
i dont go to many readings, usually just close freinds (so rarely does
someone interesting come through to read here; the only person who books
outside writers in the area has stongly academic tastes); my main excuse is
having a day job, a family and my own writing and publishing to tend to.

What I meant by LACMA was Will Alexander's Writers On Site grant-funded
symposium, and the Cal Arts Asian Art weekend.

While Laurel Ann Bogen is certainly regional, she is rather hardworking.  I
find it hard to believe she is actually opposed to lengthening her mailing
list.  Also, since she's teaching the on-the-ground entry-level workshop at
UCLA Extension this term, I've got some wonderfully experimental beginners (I
feel were pushed over into) my online version.

Ah, but that horribly organized poetry tent at that book fair.  And what is
this Susan Loomis Y2K poetry shindig?  Why did Molly Bendall charge FIFTEEN
DOLLARS for her last reading?  What is that?  And what about the Barnsdall Art
Park?

But as for money, or Monet (but that's in San Diego), seems to be a matter of
outreach.  For every hack out of Harvard there are people who, with a push,
could  find that $25,000. is really a tiny sum, really not enough for a car,
but just enough to issue a book, not of one's own work, but, you know,
something one was able to help get done.  Really a lot classier than all those
actors writing about sunset in Malibu.

It's really "Los Angeles, the Four Economies".

Parmidean sphere, from which nothing at all can be deduced. Explaining
carried out rigorously, has led finally to explaining away! This is
indeed the Selbstmord der Vernunft. Meyerson's (and parcelli's) own term
for the predicament is, 'THE EPISTEMOLOGICAL PARADOX.' His classic
discussion of explanation, the Explication, which begins with the
insistence upon the third factor, the realistic penchant of science,
ends with the climactic--and despairing--statement of the
epistemological paradox."---from Explanation & Reality In the Philosophy
of Emile Meyerson by Thomas R. Kelly---carlo parcelli
(It's too bad I haven't been able to let Meyerson speak for himself but
I've misplaced a collection of his essays published by Dover which
contain Meyerson's own insights regarding Epistemological Paradox
beginning with his critique of Einstein's special & general
relativities.)

He says to say he hasn't heard from her in a long time, and that although no

I haven't read the essay, so I'm not sure if the "seeding" is
discussed as anything more than a textual artifact (i.e., no
incriminating letters from Lowell). In that case, it just seems
to be another example of the way criticism and poetry depend
on each other in the 20th century, and, indeed, in any other
century. Did Shakespeare "seed" Hamlet with melancholy so that
the psycologies of the time would see their theories mirrored
on the stage?

Which years of Lowell can't you stand? I personally don't care
for some of his later work -- _Histories_ seems a royal pain in
the ass, a sort of failed hermeticism. He tried to be Yeats, but
failed ("failed utterly"). But it seems as if there is a lot of
difference in his early (and much later) work. If the list has
polarized into camps in my absence, then I'm certaintly on Lowell's
side. Again, I'm not familiar with the "wax museum" book, so if
I've missed the point, apologies. Does Plath get the same treatment
from Perloff? I would assume that she could also easily be accused
of New Critical pandering, but Perloff, as I remember, writes
very highly of her in places.

What is the difference -- morally speaking -- between seeding your
work with Leavis and taking a liberal helping of Derrida? It doesn't
matter if you like Derrida more; as countless poetic failures in our
time testify, it's not the source, but the channeling.

Todd Baron (and months of burying my head in Margy Sloan's Moving
Borders) prompted this response:

To my mind, any innovative writing (by a femininst) that challenges,
innovates on, problematizes, makes interesting,  or
moves away from an identity/voice-based poetics (which employs lyric
forms so called "masculine" in this context because they're
"traditional" and tradition, created by men, is "masculine")
is necessarily post-feminist
(i.e. moving away from 1st and 2nd wave feminist agendas  -- giving
voice to women's experience, recovering erased women, creating an
exclusively  "women's cannon," and working to be inclusive of other
oppressed identities, etc.)

That puts writers like Alice Notley, Leslie Scalapino, Joan Retallack,
and Lyn Hejinian in interesting positions, as they all work toward an
ungendered poetics (i.e.not priviliging the experiences of women, or
viewing innovative writing practices as somehow "feminine" counterparts to
the "masculine" tradition -- tho Retallack holds onto this distinction
most strongly, and makes it most useful) while retaining (and now I have
to add Susan Howe to the list, but it of course continues to grow) a
feminist awareness of literary history.

Alice Notley once wrote "you can't have your own tradition, it's not nice"
though she's repeatedly invested in configuring a "woman's epic" --  how a
woman can write (through) a traditionally masculine form.

I find this the most interesting challenge facing women writers today --
but doesn't it also face men writers?  They face the same tradition, and
and have every reason and right to challenge the (cultural)
construction of their gender and of  "our" tradition (I mean by "our" not
as a gendered distinction but the fact that cultures, via literary
history, construct traditions -- so we're all sort of faced with this
thing to go to work on -- is it really "ours," this inheritance?

Yesterday was the 150th anniversary of Caddie Stanton et al's Womens
Declaration -- modeled after that "masculine" form, it reads as a sort of
"fill in the blanks" substitute "woman" for "man."  It's not as simple as
all that -- but I wonder whether and how men respond to tradition.  Why I
feel obliged (in a way) to read (almost exclusively at this point of my
bread-crumb spewing) women writers.  I'm well aware that men read women &
vice versa -- I don't have a problem with women being "under-represented"
(that makes me a post-feminist)(even though I'd like to see more talk that
I feel really invested in on this list). But I wonder why the problematic
way that "tradition" has treated/"constructed" gender is presently a
"woman's problem."

And another question:
How can forms be "masculine" when, though, they were
"created" by  men, they were done (usually) intensely in relation to
"woman" (no matter how facile and passive his construction of her?)

all yours in words,

        I can't remember if this topic was covered
here or on the British Poet's list, but the question
of feminism in poetry is similar to the question of
political action in general. I've made this point
before, but again: the only "true" source of politics
in poetry consists in the innovation of form. Subject
matter is forceless, because there are far more effective
means of conveying political beliefs than a poem, and
it's more often than not the poorer poems that are the
most effective political cants. Even the gender of
the author is immaterial to the extent that it does
not cause a shift in the methods of creation, although
I don't mean to dismiss anthologists who seek to include
women -- gender often is a deep source of voice.

I think you've sort of answered your own question here;
with a basic idea of how poets create -- through a combination
of observation and language -- there seems to be no reason
that the Poetics of the "male gaze" (yadda, yadda) would
bear any relation to that that might be written by a woman.

The question of moving the love poem away from "constructions
of the self" is another part of this; it's not what you see,
it's how. One doesn't expect an 18th gynecologist and a 20th
century midwife to concur in their visions of a woman; the
difference would arise from the point of view of a third person.
"Gynceological", "Masculine", is how we label them.

Simon --

yes, I agree, (you wrote "the only "true" source of politics
in poetry consists in the innovation of form")
but I think you perhaps misread me. I wasn't talking about "gender
[as] . . .a deep source of voice" -- That is exactly the facile
premise that MOVING BORDERS allows us to move away from.
I agree that many "women's anthologies" come to that, but MOVING
BORDERS doesn't.  I also have a problem with _needing_ a women's
anthology at this point in time as it is a sort of ghettoization.
But as Todd Baron points out, we are having this conversation so we
need it.  If not a ghetto than MOVING BORDERS serves to collect (and
allow readers to compare) the thought of innovative women poets of 2+
generations.  We may reveal that feminism, a feminist poetics, is
many things and in varying degrees concerned with gender at all.
"Feminism _in_ poetry" is different (and yes, often voice based) from poetry that
comes out of a feminist awareness of one's context -- which is
operative in the poets I mention -- scalapino, howe, hejinian etc.

you say, in an interesting dialogue to Elizabeth Treadwell's (et al
-- i don't know the post she originally lifted from)
wonderings of about a week ago
> The question of moving the love poem away from "constructions
> of the self" is another part of this; it's not what you see,
> it's how.

I agree.
Tradition is masculine (created by men), true, but labelling it thus is
a problem. Male does not equal masculine.  This has been
reductive reasoning (necessarily so) on the side of feminist
scholars.  I'm interested in how we can talk about these things
(power structures -- as tradition is a power structure that
"feminizes" certain people who approach it -- I mean it "disempowers"
them -- it has nothing to do with gender in the end. )

and my point is that we label "feminist" a focus on gender in relation
to literary history -- our fault is not in labeling certain poets/ approaches
femininst (always women!! when I'm sure many men on this list will
and have come forward to say they consider themsevles (post)"feminist")
But to confine our investigation of a gendered relation to tradition
to Women.

And this is perhaps my most important point:

you say
>Even the gender of
> the author is immaterial to the extent that it does
> not cause a shift in the methods of creation,

I disagree, though, on the "materiality" of gender when approaching
tradition. Gender ISN'T immaterial, it DOES cause a (particular) shift
According to Waldrop, (as recorded in Bernstein's
 _Politics of Poetic Form_). the "main device"of
_The Road is Everywhere orStop This Body (Open Places, 1978):
     is that the object of one phrase turns into the subject of the
     next phrase without being repeated.  I was interested in
     extending the boundaries of the sentence . . .. However, it also
     comes out of my feminist preoccupation . . . I propose a pattern
     in which subject and object function are not fixed, but
     temporary, reversible roles, where there is no hierarchy of main
     and subordinate clauses, but a fluid and constant alternation.
     (61)
Waldrop deals with a theme of feminism though not "as theme."  Since
"the woman as `love object' is a prevalent archetype in our culture"
this technique, Waldrop explains "has definite feminist/political
implications."  "Of course," Waldrop adds, "this is hindsight.
Consciously, I was working on a formal problem"(66).

ALL relations cause a particular shift though.  e.g. we read celan as
having a "feminized" ("disempowered" i.e. as a jew) relation to his language.

I had an intersting dream last night.  Barbara Guest had been asked
to give an unrehearsed reading of a new female playwright.  I was in
the audience (naturally) with my partner (Chris Alexander) (naturally).
Guest would look at the script and memorize a
bunch of lines very quickly and then read them, between gulping from
a glass of water.  She didn't look quite nervous and I thought it was
very interesting but I reflected on the nature of what "experimental"
"women's" theatre HAD TO say, without having any context to know
exactly.  I found I was then looking at a t.v. screen, which was
televising the very same performance. The color on the screen was
tweeked a little and looked sort of neat. Thinking I should look at the
person and not the image. Looking back and forth a bit. More worried
than confused.  Woke up.  Can anyone tell me what this means?

Does a dream have to mean? We tend to find associative meanings with any-
thing, but dreams, which can be the mind's attempt to structure random
neural firings on another level (the randomness seems to increase with
temperature, and the dreams become more surrealist), may mean nothing at
all.

In general, that is "difficult to deal with" - this nothing at all, just
as what is taken as an omen is only the falling of a brick or a piece of
the sky.

In the post it is unclear if looking at the person instead of the image is
looking _at the person_ instead of the television; perhaps the person is
on television, in television, perhaps we are all Guests of the real in
such a fashion.

Linda,

as a male poet who has tried in various ways to respond to patriarchy *as
well as* (and also, inseperable from) other social and political
violences, encoded in and ongoing in our day-to-day world.....

--i will throw out a couple of thoughts.

I believe there *are* responses to gender oppression and disequalibrium,
in some high-profile male poets.  My first thought would be to mention
Bruce Andrews, whose responses are certainly rent and explosive (as well
as implosive..); very problematic much of the time.  Also urgent and
brilliant and i feel i've learned a lot from his work and theory.  I Don't
Have Any Paper remains a very disturbing (i use the word as praise,
mostly anyway) exploration of (among other things) the way masculine
experience is cognitively structured by experiencing otherness as violence
(and responding in kind, with violence and rage).

Pretty much the opposite, in poetic temperment, is Bernstein, who
certainly twists and yanks at tattered threads of unraveling gender
uptightness...and does so for (with, by means of) laffs.

Probably there are male poets who have been influenced by contemporary
female poets in their responses to genderpol.  Speaking for myself, S.
Howe has been central, in presenting a temperment equally different from
CB's wackiness and BA's furor:  a nuanced focus on how a consciousness can
respond to history, to the violences clenched in history, by means of an
empathy that tries not to be swept up and violated, that strives also to
avoid generating counterviolence as its tool of self-being..

*** Still mourning Diana? Shouting 'Hoo' may help

The followers of Indian free-love guru Bhagwan Rajneesh have advice
for the legions of people still traumatized by the death of Princess
Diana. Osho Dynamic Meditation, created as a way "to help modern man
release accumulated grief and tension before moving into silent
meditation," should help, the cult said Monday. The one-hour drill
starts with "deep, fast, chaotic" breathing to bring up repressed
tension followed by "total catharsis," or the throwing out of all
that has been stirred up by the breathing. Diana fans are then
advised to jump with arms raised, shouting the Sufi mantra "Hoo!"
Once that is accomplished, they are told to be still and silent, and
finally "celebrate through dance." See

linda --

        I think you're right to call me on the
phrase "gender as a deep source of voice", which
is pretty vague. What I had in mind, however,
began with the idea that one's use of language
arises in part out of where you've been in the
past and to what uses you've seen language put.
If one considers the differences in societal
experience that arise from gender, it seems as
if the "oddity" of female experience with society's
use of word would lead to different direction
in style. In retrospect, I think I overestimated
such influences -- looking at, say, the Modernists,
there are far more differences between poets
than there are between genders; sort of like S.Gould's
point that there is far more variation within a
race than across racial boundaries.

> Tradition is masculine (created by men), true, but labelling it thus is
> a problem. Male does not equal masculine.

I guess I have a lot of trouble distinguishing
"male" from "masculine" without descending into
a deep analysis of society's conception of
the masculine. "Male" is biological; that
we can all (?) agree on, up to the Foucalt limit.
To call celan's language "feminized" sounds strangely
quaint, a little like calling a particular philosophy
"womanish". I saw a book once called "Nietzsche for Women".

But maybe Foucalt has a point here -- if what we
consider "rock solid" notions of gender are seen,
by an examiniation of the points of rupture, to arise
less from any potentially objective criteria, but instead
from threads of discourse, where does that take us?


I guess I don't quite understand how you take
gender to be in some way _material_ without returning
to the reception of woman in society. Your point
seems very interesting, however -- I like the way
Waldrop problematizes the whole issue by bringing
up the political implications of a formal stance
("old school feminism"?) and then retracts them
from discussion by noting that she was working on
"a formal problem". At the risk of breaking Adorno's
dictum and paraphrasing a philosophical stance,
is Waldorf coming out and saying that certain formal
modes where, for e.g., "subject and object function
are not fixed", are essentially gendered? That there
is some occult connection between the female body
and language? How can a feminist poetics, as you
say, be potentially "unconcerned" with gender? Isn't
gender the sine qua non? Or is it just the starting
point? From there, to where does it go?

There is a danger, of course, that "postfeminism"
might end up looking like New Criticism -- an analysis of
formal structures within a "self contained and democratic
whole".

As a side note, I wonder what the "theoretically apatheic"
folk on the list think about the problem, since Waldorf's
point seems to be a retreat from traditional activist
notions of poetry. Henry, others?

I thought I ought to note that Poetry Daily (normally pronounced "Dully") --
www.poems.com -- is making an exception to its usual fare this week and will
feature poems next weekend by the following:

Saturday - Rae Armantrout
Sunday - Michael Palmer

The site also has links to lots of stuff, including whatever is the latest in
the mainstream media. There's a shortlist for some prize in the UK that will
make you cringe.

Poultry Doily --- www.poems.com -- also has a link to an article in one of the
SF papers about the search there for a Poet Laureate (does one hear Kathleen
Fraser's name? Palmer's? Rakosi's? Gluck's? Killian or Bellamy? Myung Mi Kim?

In addition, the SF Chronicle has a contest going on the "Best of" for the Bay
Area -- you can get to it quickly through www.sfgate.com -- and there is a
category for East Bay Bookstore that seems just made for Small Press
Distribution. It would be good to give it support -- SPD is really a national
(even international) resource.

There's also a "best Bay Area author" selection that I'd hesitate to make any
suggestions about, but it would be great to see a bunch of poets get votes.

Which reminds me of something the Brothers Quay (who made the extraordinary
film _Institute Benjamenta_, among others) said, when challenged about the
lack of narrative structure in their films; something along the lines of
"No-one says, 'I had this amazing dream last night, but it had such a lousy
story'".


BTW Alan, you may be interested in the following url (you may already know

my last response was sluggish--tired--too:

to re-state:

Gender then is a role we are put into and take on--
I find interest in a response to and notice of gender
as a social and written tool--but
the attention paid to such as a poet doesn't interest me
though the forms (sigh) do:

sonnett as skyscraper
shakespeare  as Mies

take them apart to see wherer one lives
and renotgiate the halls--

Is there a "masculine" form? The Epic?
Is history retold as a sequence of (told) lies
of the victor? The victor then reframing HimSelf
as male?

The description of dreams as 'attempt to structure random neural firings' is
too often taken a step further to dismissing dreams as therefore meaningless.
Is not poetry an attempt to do the same with life's random firings?

 Language can either anchor meaning in an image or else helps serve a relay
function to put the image into relation with other elements in a complex
structure. - Barthes

is it not then the image (or dream) that really matters or means?

This depends on how "meaning" is defined - as symptom, portent, or as
something acceptable to the mind as constituting sense.

I would never go so far in relation to poetry unless one wants to say
everything is such an attempt.

No, why or how? And what is meant by "really" here? I would be wary of
assigning priority.

Responding to the various threads of this thread, I'd like to recommend a
book that has really turned my head around on some of these issues & I wonder
if others have read it too.  The book is _Bardic Ethos and the American
Epic Poem_ by Jeffrey Walker.

One thing Walker does is analyze the long poem as a specific development
out of Whitman & Emerson, that WITHIN a a challenging "alternative" rhetoric
(Whitman's free-verse democratic open-shirted rough), encodes an elitist
and authoritarian message: American culture must be transformed by
a select group of transcendental literati speaking an archaic shamanistic
poetic speech AGAINST the rationality of civil society.  Walker argues
that Pound took this approach to its limit and Crane, Williams, and Olson
followed in the same tradition (anyone who wonders at the idea of Williams'
"elitism" should read some of the quotes Walker includes from IN THE AMERICAN
GRAIN: ie. "puritanism" has resulted  in "a generation universally eager to
barter permanent values (the hope of an aristocracy) in return for
opportunist material advantages..."  and later in the same text, Williams
claims that an aristocracy is "the flower of a locality and so the full
expression of a democracy".

I don't want to get into a long illustration of Walker's book; only to point
out that the traditions of innovation and experiment - both male-oriented and
feminist - have been heavily influenced by the Whitman-Pound STANCE toward
traditions and society, and their approach to epic and poetry should be
seen as culturally & historically specific (even peculiar). Their approach to
writing has had enormous influence on the "alternative' tradition to this day.

I would disagree with Simon that technique rather than subject matter is where
the "alternatives" are marked; I would disagree with Notley & Waldrop (if
that's what they're saying) that formal innovation is the only challenging
writing.  In my view the subject & the technique can't be separated, and
a really innovative writing today might implement the "ars est celare artem"
or "art is to hide art" approach: developing a "modest" style which foregrounds
the real history or real story.

I would also suggest that the strictures against "male voice" should not
throw writers uncritically into the experimental-formalist camp; Walker's
book shows clearly how Whitman's, Pound's, Williams's "abysmal" rhetoric
of anti-rational collage have been applied to the most archaic (shamanistic)
and authoritarian rhetorical programs of our age. The crux of the problem is
the foregrounding of the heroic shaman as exemplar and leader, as opposed
to the true "subject" of democracy, which is not a leader but a process of
political covenanting and agreement, or peacemaking.

When the New York poets come into town you=92ve got to lie about Time and
Space. For example, a New England poet who lives 10 minutes from the
Conference Space will tell the New York poets that the Conference Space is a
ten minute walk. The New England poet plans to leave for the Conference
Space about fifteen minutes before the starting time. OK, say the New York
poets. At 18 minutes before the starting time, however, the New York poets
decide they each need a shower. The New England poet will never learn.=20

But this is cool (not to mention exaggerated) and only mentioned as a
starting point. We=97-Drew, Douglas, Dave, and I=97-made the walk with no
problem save that Harvahd Yahd was blocked off by construction fences on the
interior so that we had to skirt along the alleys of the Yard and miss the
strange clich=E9 of its bucolic interior. We arrived just as Aaron was
speaking which gave us, me at least, no time to talk to anyone. This is
ideal when reading.=20

Some places from which people traveled for the alternative Boston conference
this weekend at 56 Brattle Street, a limestone=92s throw from the Longfellow
House: New York, Los Angeles, Toronto, Buffalo, Providence, San Francisco,
and Japan.=20

What was learned?=20

1) Only poets would spend a 3 day weekend in a hot and cramped room for up
to, or over, 12 hours a day on a beautiful, sunny weekend and be very
excited about it.

2) If the conference is deemed "alternative," then anything goes. I slipped
a Robert Frost poem into my reading ("The Vantage Point") and heard a
distinct, pleasurable "hmphh" come from outside the veil of U-V lights. It
was my backyard; I had to do it.

I decided not to read the short poem about how lousy it is to be in a room
full of milling poets. This is because I was a reader, and that produces a
kind of rush for me. Besides, my "I Make a Pact with you Ron Silliman" poem
fell flat. Not a giggle was heard. People told me later that I read it as
something very serious, but I have always cried the tears of a clown.=20

Drew=92s reading was fantastic. It is unusual that I was able to hear it
(having just read, and playing back my own reading=97-so egocentrically!-=97=
in
my mind) but his opening was sharp and irresistable: "I can tell by the way
you dress that you=92re a cowboy." (Roughly.) And his reading was paced so
that in the silences I became expectant of the poems, waiting, paying more
attention; and as Drew read more, the energy soared.=20

During Will Alexander=92s reading I must admit that I lapsed into space. I
bounced back for Fanny Howe however. I was so engrossed by her reading that
when she stopped I thought my watch was dead. She only read for 10-15
minutes. It seemed, richly, like much longer. And I wanted more.

During the milling bit after the reading a Harvard Lit Comp prof. approached
me with the usual chat and asked for poems. No problem. Then she explains,
as she hands me her business card, that she is waiting for her mother to die
("she will not, eternally, ever give in. She refuses to die!") so she can
take her inheritance and publish poetry. (And people probably think I am
sour for the little poem about "milling poets" but I am sure you each have
your own stories to tell.) Having nothing to answer this strange remark I
stand smiling, nodding, scanning the room with my eyes. Peter Ganick tells
me he loved my line about "the way cowboys dress." (Should I tell him?
Should I tell him?) I tell him that line was actually Drew Gardner=92s line
which causes him a visceral spasm of embarrassment. (It had to be done.)=20

On the walk to the car Prageeta and Maggie discuss lesbian dress protocol
which has an emphasis on practicality. As I never dress with an objective
other than practicality (i.e., comfort) I one-up them on the entire
aesthetic by adding, "besides I don=92t give a fuck what I look like"=
 wearing
green shorts, a black T-shirt (both of which are drenched), old running
sneakers and ankle-high socks. This boldness earns me the epithet of "Dan:
the Complete Lesbian" which I revel in for a night.=20

Meanwhile, my friend Sven from Cambridge (a Spenser scholar) and Douglas
grab a ride with Richard. Richard is filming the entire conference for some
reason. In the car Sven notices a hat from Washington & Lee=97-a college in
Virginia renowned for old-boy fraternities and inbred aristocracy. The hat
produces apprehension in Sven, and he hopes it does not come up in
conversation. But Douglas has already picked up on its motto (which I
disremember) and inquires of it of Richard. As it turns out, Richard and
Sven both "spent time" there, and may likely be (despite their generation
differences) the only two alums never to have belonged to a fraternity. They
discuss later, at Michael Franco=92s, a shared hate for a certain Milton
professor.=20

The party is fine. We get home ok in the crowded car, with Douglas in the
trunk. I give Maggie and Prageeta directions to the Mass Pike, but Dave
Kirschenbaum prefers not to make the short walk from the bridge, so Maggie
and Prageeta end up getting lost for many hours. We don=92t see them again
till well into the next day.=20

In the morning I make juice for everyone (oranges and grapes, straight
up=97-very rich), and we arrive during the panel almost on time. I cannot
process anything being said so I try to focus by making sketches of the
panelists. I gauge my success by showing the caricatures to Isabel Franco
(sitting next to me) as I go. I am feeling better when manna from heaven
drops into my lap in the form of a scone, placed with a "whump" from behind
me by Douglas.=20

Some things I remember: Joseph Lease=92s metaphor about how the Cold War was
two dogs facing each other, and the Post-Cold War a single dog in which we
are all micro-organisms. This guy can think on his feet I think. But he
dilutes this perception by announcing that he had thought of it earlier and
even collaborated on it by phone with Jordan Davis. Still, he=92s saying
intelligent things, as are all the panelists.=20

Despite a dangerous level of exhaustion I enjoy the afternoon readings.
Gerrit Lansing is fantastic. He is my new model for reading. Beth is great,
as is Andrea; the two reminding me of each other in their delivery: low,
even tone of long (or long-ish) lines. Joe Torra is high-energy. Zhang Er is
good, and Caroline Knox is funny.=20

>From the bio panel I mostly take comfort in Kristen=92s presentation that
Helen Adam worked a dull job in which she was able to get a lot done during
down time. I decide I like Helen Adam a lot and will seek out her work. I
get this also from Lyman Gilmore=92s presentation on Joel Oppenheimer, whom=
 I
have not read much of. Then I take off to a bar with Patrick Doud to cool
off with a margarita, which is refreshing for about fifteen minutes, but I
nearly pass out later during the evening readings. In fact I was probably
saved from doing so by Lisa Jarnot=92s and Lewis Warsh=92s reading. Warsh=92=
s
"Secret Police" had me stitches; Lisa=92s chinchilla and other animal poems
had me in a pleasant catatonic state. Kristin Prevallet=92s footnote poem=
 also
created this effect. Untitled, I suggested to her: "A poem of not-so-useful
information."   =20

Another party at Michael and Isabel=92s Saturday night. I crash for an hour=
 in
an empty room, waking up glad to find the Buffalo/Toronto guys had not drawn
on my forehead, and also finding Christian crashed (vampire-like: body
straight, arms folded in X on chest) on the floor across the room.=20

Outside there is literary chat. And Dave Kirschenbaum putting together his
instant =91zine on a laptop in a cloud of mosquitoes by the porch light. The
literary chat gets controversial: Douglas argues with Alan about Paradise
Lost. Alan, in a manner reminiscent of Steve Evans, sits calmly and accepts
Douglas=92 points and then evenly returns his own. The crux: what line does
Milton=92s epic hinge on & is Satan a hero? Alan is firm: better to reign in
hell than serve in heaven. Douglas does not accept. It goes back and forth,
bringing Dante, Chaucer, and Chomsky (a la Drew and Bill Howe) marginally
into the picture. Hanging back I suggest "to justify God=92s ways to man"
which Andrea seconds. (As I was not centrally involved in this argument,
I=92ll cease its narrative here.)=20

Because I am the only one not to have had a drink all night, I drive the car
home. It=92s tight and we gather Will Alexander and Aaron from the driveway
top where they had been waiting for a cab. Douglas gets into the trunk
again, Aaron sits on Dave in the passenger seat and away we go. Another
thing learned from the weekend: an overcrowded car with the conference
organizer=92s head protruding from an open window does not sit well with
Arlington police. As I pull over with the blue lights and siren screaming
behind us, Aaron queries (from outside the car) "why are we pulling over
here? Who are we dropping off here?"

It was difficult to ascertain whether the cops were poetry fans. I mean, I
could have said "it=92s cool, officer, we have Will Alexander in the car"=
 but
I=92m not sure how that would have played out.=20

So, as the cops approached, one on each side, I announce sternly to the
excited passengers: "everyone shut the fuck up." One cop asks me if I am
aware how many seat belt laws I am breaking. One per person except me I
think to myself but say nothing. I give him my license. Hess fumbles
(unsuccessfully) for his Missouri registration. The officers (one male, one
female) note aloud how dangerous our driving situation is, and then huddle
up back at the cruiser to ensure our Dodge Shadow is not stolen. As they
confer in swirling blue lights, Aaron announces that he and Will can walk
from that point and he wishes us well. I tell Aaron that it=92s probably not
advisable to walk away from the scene at that particular moment.=20

To be short, the cops let us off without even requesting an intimate
acquaintance with my breath. We leave two by the road while we drop off
another two and return for the other two shortly. As I was handed back my
license it didn=92t even occur to me that the law officers will forever=
 remain
unaware of Douglas Rothschild, now grown very quiet, cooped up in the
hatch-back trunk. Later, Douglas noted that the incident constituted a good
adventure, and it would make Bill Luoma proud.=20

On Sunday I outted SubPress in the publishing panel. Preceding this debut
were fine presentations by Kirschenbaum (the traveling/instant magazine),
Douglas Messerli (brief history of Sun&Moon), Peter Ganick (brief history of
Potes&Poets), Chris Funkhouser (on Internet publishing and E-things in
general), and Joe Torra (on his magazine "lift").=20

I began by showing off books received thru the "Self-Publish or Perish"
initiative, and note how the project grew out of a community; how it all was
(my involvement anyway) an extension of MASS AVE., which grew out of a sense
of community that began at the Fitterman Poetry Talks in 1996, the Buffalo
Poetics list, and then the Subpoetics list (at which point I thumbnail for
people what a listserv is). RESULTS: A lot of people want to inspect
the SelfPub books after the panel. A lot of people want to know how to get
onto the "Buffalo list thing," and many more people want to know where to
send money for the "SubPress" thing. I take their addresses instead.=20

Someone (Maria Damon?) tells me her initial thoughts of what the publishing
panel would consist of was "how to get published." It was not so. It was
more a testimony of doing things oneself, how to seek out or define your
community thru print and initiative (as Torra=92s presentation manifested,=
 and
Michael Franco=97-contrib editor to lift=97-supported with comments in the
audience). I was happy with it.=20

There were many great readings Sunday: Rosmarie Waldrop, Joseph Lease,
Patrick Doud, Charles Bernstein, Damon Krukowski, Peter Ganick and others;
some of which I caught portions of, or missed due to extreme unction, I mean
extreme exhaustion.=20

The weekend ended for me in a seafood restaurant near my house with Beth,
Maggie, Drew and Douglas. I had the fish and chips.=20

After they left for the bus, I went back to the reading and then to the
party where I talked with Cambridge poet Jim Dunn (who traded my cop/poetry
story with his own, in which a Boston bike cop runs into his car while he is
driving John Wieners to the supermarket; "oh christ!" John exclaims) and
Heater Scott Peterson (a painter, poet, bookbinder, and ex-student of Ange
Mlinko's).=20

Other participants or attendees are encouraged/requested to fill in gaps or
post their own narratives and perceptions to supplement this woeful=
 inadequacy.=20

Tell me who was it that stepped on a dog's turn and unstepped it just as

headed for France or Brazil or France, back and forth, this way and that,

I would say we both agree; I had in mind poets who consider themselves
innovative simply because their subject matter is "new". Pound's "make
it new" is eternally valid, but it doesn't stop at changing the stars
into quasars. The stylistic innovation is more often than not the more
original and difficult; most "subjects" have already been done before,
and it's unfortunately true that whenever a new subject is broached --
child abuse, the information revolution -- most of what is written is
in the dull and repetitive modes of older forms, or in poorly thought
out and self-conscious "innovations".

It's true that the subject and technique cannot be separated, but that
requires a more complex concept of "subject" that I don't think you're
including here. There have been countless poems on war, and I don't
think anyone can find a common theme in technique between them.

I'm interested in your concept of a "modest" style. What does that mean?
Imagism has always seemed "modest" to me, with the way it foregrounds
the words themselves as opposed to the poet's construction of them, but
one could easily take any set of poets, with radically different styles,
and call them modest. Shakespeare, modest? Auden? Yeats? Plath? What
would you consider a "modest" style? Or, better, in which direction from
the writers you consider most fruitful does a "modest" style lie? (The
excessive quotes are not sarcasm, just my own confusion.) And, just to
finish the paragraph, what do you consider the "real" story? Do you
mean to exclude all poetry with ambiguity or mulitple narratives, because
they deny the reader access to a solid and "real" substrate?

Henry -- thanks also for the reference to the Walker book.
For many poets who attempt to write an "epic", the aristocratic
model presents itself, and Walker's analysis of the Whitman
attitude towards America seems dead on -- the endless catalogues
always seemed to me to have somewhat a posessive attitude, an
image of control or at least omnisence; a "true" democratic poet
would perhaps have to realize a speaker that could not transcend
space in the most literal sense -- I think of Gary Snyder here,
with his endless preoccuption with the mechanics of being.

There's been chatter on EPOUND-L about Pound and the Occult; a
question I brought up in reference to Old English translations
of the bible -- questions of preserving the numerological
significance of the text in translation. Pound himself, when
constructing the Cantos, was quite preoccupied with the occult
-- as separate from questions of religion and spirituality; I
wonder if you can detect the "aristocracy" of Pound's style
in his mage-like adoption of occult principles. If anybody's
interested in the references to Pound's occultism, backchannel;
Michael Coyle at Colgate dropped a good list of texts on the
subject.

Simon, I've yammered at some of these issues before on the list, so apologies
 if I repeat myself.  By "subject" I guess I mean "content"
in general, not simply a general topic or theme (war, etc.).  These themes
or topics are always around, but if we're talking about a "modest" style in
relation to something like epic, for example, then the "war" would have to
be complexified in its specific historical circumstances.

What I'm getting at is, to extend some of the insights of the Walker book:
Ezra Pound was mightily successful within the parameters of a sublime
rhetoric, in which the poet by disrupting rational thought &
speech, creates a voice of authority; what Walker argues is that writing
in this tradition is not the ONLY possible approach to epic or historical
materials.

But we have an alternative tradition which not only builds on this rhetoric
but follows the Whitman-Pound "stance" as a whole : capitalistic democracy
is condemned in favor of a visionary alternative which is not exactly
spelled out (it can't be : this would contradict the rhetoric of the
sublime) but which underwrites every mannerism of disrupted syntax and
justifies it as "alternative".

A modest style in my book would foreground neither the stance of the poet
nor the sublimity of the discourse; the sublime is most sublime as an
occasional intrusion.  It would not be disruptive for disruption's sake
or dissonant for dissonance's sake; it would develop from communicability
toward complexity.  It would foreground "what happened": clarity does not
necessarily rule out ambiguity or even undecidability (while obscurity
sometimes rules out both).

Now I'm not in favor of capitalistic status quo, but I am in favor of
democracy (I think capitalism/socialism is a fading dialectic).  And
I'm not in favor of techno-rationalism, but I'm against a bardic
authoritarianism posed as its alternative.

And I'm not promoting "modesty" as a mold for all kinds of poetry!
Just as a different way of thinking about "innovative" writing,
especially in an "epic" frame of mind.

alan esp., please notice i asked "CAN anyone tell me what this ["my"
dream] means"  of course it just "is" but I just thought it was neat, the
experience was neat.  That it didn't particularly resonate with meaning
to me is interesting (I have no particular engagement with Guest or
with theatre -- except as icons both)

One day after having a great dream i wrote
& re-wrote it to myself, mentally, just to play with the language and
connections the dream presented me with.  I didn't write it down -- I was
walking.  I think of it (the mental exercise of moving around the language
and images of the dream) as writing, though some would argue it's not
writing because I didn't inscribe it & it hasn't been activated by
an audience as writing.  Maybe the dream was "writing" that I was the
"audience" for.

you (simon) sort of hit on my point exactly --
when you say

>  -- looking at, say, the Modernists,

there are tons of variations (back to mark presjnar's comment on "how" we
look at something).  But gender as a sort of node has received focus only
in terms of women writers, who, perhaps because they throw tradition in
relief, point out the "masculine" nature, of say lyric, which objectifies
the other and unifies the "I".  As these are problems many (esp. lang &
post lang) poets deal with, why is it mostly women who explore a GENDERED
relation to tradition?

I'm not trying to be reductive about gender.  the
way we use it to describe power relationships is problematic
(male-active/female-passive) WHILE continuing to link it to
biological sex --  as in the case of the term "Women Poets" (which often
prompts cliched responses such as "it's women's voice-oriented)

Being an innovative (woman) writer
necessitates an active scrutiny of literary history. Why is it that
innovative men aren't also viewed as exploring a gendered relation to
traditional modes of poetic utterance?  Is it just another instance of the
masculine stance being universal and the woman's other?

For so long poetry was formal & Dorothy Wordsworth didn't write "poetry"
-- now journaling has been "legitimized" as a poetic form (cf. Mayer's
_Midwinter Day_ for example, and Hannah Weiner) -- But I don't think these
innovations are peculiar to women, yet they are couched so, because they
are couched as a gendered relation to tradition (though this may be a
problem of feminist scholarship)

We all have a gendered relation to everything -- and that's such a large
statement, as gender is so complex.  And I don't mean gender as biological
sex merely, but as a cluster of attributes that constitute our
understanding of culture and literary history.

My point exactly -- why link "feminine" with womanish? You're making a
biological and not a gendered connection. (As for the title, it's just
dumb -- I'm tired of the notion that there is certain sort of information
that women must know (to defend themselves?)  MIght the same information
not be imperative for men as well?).  I'm maddened that it persists to be
true (i need to know how not to get raped, for example -- but this of
course has to do with the larger problems of living in a violent culture)

Then all innovation is, in relation to the "dominant" tradition,
"feminine" and it has nothing to do with gender.
Not a bad place to start rethinking what it means to be feminine.
Or to start throwing out those terms "masculine" and "feminine" because
they're obviously too laden with biological markers (Masculine = hairy
armpits are ok)

I meant that only in response to your comment that it was "immaterial" --

Only inasmuch as WE gender them, in assigning them positions in a power
relationship.  She says elsewhere that language is ungendered.

of course not, except when words (usually the title of some pop

Notley would argue that (pretty much) all forms" are masculine.
She  addresses this in "Epic and Women Poets" (paraphrase) in one of the
Naropa Disembodied Poetics anthologies (the recent one) and in her
piece excerpted in MOVING BORDERS she talks about the difficulty of
writing about VietNam -- for the same reasons -- they are/were "man made"
events, epic being a man made record of man's conquests etc.
the world (literally -- architects, civil planners, financiers etc.)
is man-made.

Kathleen Fraser's lines "otherwise the world is simply that which has been
described for you" always resonate for me.  Notley takes on
the same problem -- how to be a woman -- to be HERSELF -- and write poems?
Her writing is a record/response to that struggle.

The problem with saying that all forms are masculine, or describing
certain shapes as gendered (venus of willendorf vs. the twin towers
(double your power)though the latter is a reconstruction of matriarchy
whereas we KNOW that skyscrapers are patriarchal temples) is that there is
no point of entry. We can only "imagine" (John & Yoko?) what a more
equitable world (or poetry) would look like.  Hence innovative poetry.

Linda,
Poetry has often been metaphorized as weaving.  Does weaving create masculine
forms?  I understand you were not simply assenting to the idea that "all forms

        very much agreed, and thx Mark for the interesting read of
Andrews and Bernstein. I'd also add Silliman to that list (and
others...) -- thinking, e.g., of sentences in XING that are insistent
in their representation of male-ness/masculinity as culturally
and esp. (hetero)sexually dominant (oppressive/coercive) -- which
makes, for me as a male reader, for an uncomfortable or even
humiliating situation. Want to say more about the book (and not
leave my remarks so one-dimensional), but it's been over year since
last I read it -- quotations are not forthcoming.  ("shldn't have
drank all that cough syrup this morning").

I think the problem Linda is addressing here-- and one which
Rachel Daley and I tried severally to address not long ago (myself
with agonized clumsiness, I'm sorry to say) -- is not so much whether
the 'gender issue' affects writers of all genders (it does), but a
problem of ghettoization, in this case specifically that the critical
treatment of gender in writing too often leans toward making it a
'women's issue', and vice versa -- the insane assumption that all
women's writing necessarily has to address the reader beginning
with "I, woman, say..." or be otherwise dictated by biology. LR:

It was hot! And anywhere from 40 to 80 people in a room that was about
15x35 with two ceiling fans and two low-BTU ACs doing their best and
probably enough or else we would have all melted into a pool of poetics on
the floor. and there were highlights (not to speak of the lights over the
stage with the funky orange gels) and for me it was first among equals
with Will Alexander whose name I had seen here and there and before but
not the poems and his presentation in which he directed thoughts and
phrases out of his head into the air and from the air into his head with
his index finger. it was digital one moment, analog the next. and then
Sunday a.m.'s panel, "New Poetry," orgainzed by Michael Basinski around
and about and between visual, aural, fusion, performance poetics and
beyond. This is where the bowling ball was which I missed in process but
saw the product upon the floor being cut off the roll of white paper and
its skid marks and runes by Bill Howe with a box cutter it seemed like the
ones used in grocery stores, all to make way for the afternoon reading
which was slipping into the present as the panel edged up to the limit of
its future. it was close. Douglas Messerli, Rosmarie Waldrop, Patrick
Doud, Michael Franco and I introduced myself to Maria Damon up from Woods
Hole. but that was now and there was still then: Christian Bok and his
sound poems one of which was called "Ubu Hubbub" I think and it was
syllables and sounds and Bill Clinton and maybe even Jimmy Carter's
malaise upon the land. and then there was Bob Grumman, oh Bob Grumman, is
there anybody with a better map up by bus 26 hours from Florida and
sleeping on comfortable couches from what I heard there in Cambridge, not
Beantown. mathemaku: now I know why I took 2nd semester calculus and why
if I wuzn't infected by these poems, I might have been a mathematician and
then again maybe not but no need now because the asymptotes and delta
neighborhoods, and primes and theory, number theory, are there are there.
Darren Wershler-Henry (I'm pretty sure it was him) did a poem in Klingon.
Wendy Kramer and Ellay Phillips eyedeared their way around a 3-D collage,
reading words and pictures and weaving and dancing. Oh, and Michael
Basinski and his daughter Natalie rendered words and pictures and sounds
and definitions (this was the place of mushrooms, shrooms) in their
amuletic poem because it releases.
It's Tuesday afternoon. I just came home from a swim at the beach. I'm
still hot.

best and best,
Steven

First I'd like to say, since I bemoaned the review in the NYer, that the
summer issue of Bookforum contains a much more interesting review of the new
Lib of Cong Stein anthologies.

Linda, SImon, et al--I will now throw in 2 more cents.

Is there a possibility of an ungendered poetics, even if it is something its
possible to work toward or to see others as working toward?  I mean if
you're looking in terms of gender, won't you see gender?

I wonder what postfeminism really is -- is it an apology I wonder sometimes
(tho I do write for a site called 'the Postfeminist Playground' - which this
month contains an article by DOdie Bellamy(www.pfplayground.com)) I think
PLAY is key to this -- perhaps we are now more free to PLAY -- to speculate,
to speculate on speculations,...- than in the 50s or the Victorian era or
whenever, with GENDER AS AN IDEA, construction, etc.....The motifs of our
clothing.  Maybe we are just now more able to have FUN (or if you prefer:
imagination).  I don't mean this dumbly, I mean not having to spend so much
energy "to not be swept up and violated, (& also) to avoid generating
counterviolence as its tool of self-being".

I do CLAIM writing as a woman, writing as a "girl", writing about that,
engaging in that.  Proud of that, then bored by it, etc.  Its constantly
ENACTED isnt it, along with ten dozen (or a few) other Big Things....
I like it, writing as a WOMAN, thnking about Women.  However I of course
don't want to be 'marginalized' either, or not taken seriously, or taken
seriously in only one way.
(But of course it happens...to everyone)  misreading is so key aint it
intriguin/

I do like Linda read many more women than men.

Why? I think my next point might speak to it at least in some way.

Here I can't agree.  I think the "Poetics of a male gaze" does bear relation
to that that might be written by a woman.  Here and now.  From childhood,
books with first person male narrators, looking at movies, whatever: the
woman not only sees 'herself' ('itself') *in* 'the male gaze', but *sees as*
the male gaze, or self-gaze, or whatever.  It's like the beginning of "The
Bluest Eye".

& of course there are responses to gender oppression and disequilibrium in
the work of some high profile male poets, as someone wrote, this strikes me
as having gone on since the beginning of time.  whether they were aware of
it in our current jargon or not, and no matter what kind of personality or
politic or wife-treatment they lived in.  isn't even creating something in a
way responding to it?  I think so.

as perhaps one of the "theoretically apathetic"  I would like to note that
in the quote from Waldrop, she first states "I was interested in extending
the boundaries of the sentence" then says "it comes out of my feminist
preoccupation" [this quote is 20 yrs old] and then says this is all
hindsight, "Consciously, I was working on a formal problem."   So it seems
to me that she was interested in form, whilst of course being aware of
herself as a woman/feminist and *in the world as such*.  I don't think
gender is the starting point or the only point, i think she is merely using
it as a way in to explain something, as TRACTION, and then of course there
are all these other conscious and unconscious things,
RETRACTION..............................
.....what if the male poets had to explain themselves in this type of
terminology?  Isn't your gender important to you, and then again hardly the
only thing?

    Hey, anybody who attended conference, wanna say anything about
    Caroline Knox's reading and/or talk?
    She's kinda the one person there I have NO SENSE about what she's
    doing, and am curious (also because I think she spoke of O'Hara,
    Ashes, etc.....). Thanks, chris stroffolino

you are absolutle and correct!
I agree in all way
and from my privilidge and
handicapped zone (male)
I am more than stuck in my
gender stupidity--as we all are...

But yes--the forms--hmmmmm....are masculine
and such--what do you think of Dickinson's
rewritting the hymnal structure--which is male--and damn it--is
writing--gender based--re
writing or reasembling of structure--and sometimes
I wonder if it's all structure anyway--and
how sad..but tghe narrative...the epic...the content-based
and lecture hall--the architecture of the 20th century

(war)

yes--I agree and love Notley's undergound ventures
and Mayers "Letter to mothers..."...and (sigh) (sic)
is there a maleness seriously paid attention to I wonder
in the newer poets? Is Silliman "new sentence"--there is an address
there to self/and gender/no?

Hmmm...
I am lost in the funhouse for sure..

Tb
(ReMap)

ps: which is one reason Carolyn and I do ReMap--I would NOT do a
magazine alone--nor with another male--have done that--and yes--I
believe strongly our magazine was prone to
pen(is) as I hope RE MAp is not (but
not without ink, too!)

dearly missed poetics persons,

 newly settled for a year in louisville, i am happy to announce
the appearance of *The Seven Voices*, just published by O Books.
it's all poetry, with a way-cool 4-color cover image of one of
joseph cornell's boxes.

 you can order it from small press distribution, through their mag
or website (www.spdbooks.org) -- leslie has a website too, for
O Books (www.obooks.com).  it's perfectbound, $10, 96 pages, and the
blurbs are really sweet though i'm too shy to include them here.

  those boston conference reports, btw, are lovely --

dickinson's  hymnal (todd baron) are you penning HYMENAL stretched
over all our noses - cf, Christo's hymen over the colorado basin -

ah thx chris and linda, getting a bit more of this thread into the lingo,
the lack of necessity to decided HERE or NOW - delueze might say to FOLLOW
that nose sometime not just try to re-do it, no need to continue
reproducing MY self,me Self, mEYEsELF  - a la scalapino yes or also parts
of Stevens
i have recently bumped into . is  a  matter of FOLLowing what i can
imagine is someone elses nose, my own surroundings as they are always MY
surroundings and ...so stevens is a bastard cannot i like him already?
when he rocks my boat - surprises even the superhuman....'like this saps
like the sun true fortuner for all it takes it gives a humped return
exchequering from piebald fiscs
unkeyed

postfeminist seems , in large parrt my party dress today or
my do to the do before i figure where it hurts
- as long as it does and it does and it does


so maybe 'gendering' becomes a convenient term? can it be utilized, i
think yes as anything that keeps moving, and this is , like, one of the
most popular threads that lingers and recurs and full of buttons...

Chris, I wasn't there but I will vouch for her books, which are astonishing,
pitched carefully at a resonance between mirth and despair, assertively
idiosyncratic, and very smart.  Good reading, especially for a heat wave.

toddbaron said (in replying to a post from Linda Russo):

you are absolutle and correct!
I agree in all way
and from my privilidge and
handicapped zone (male)
I am more than stuck in my
gender stupidity--as we all are...

To which (besides questioning his spelling, and differing with Jordan on
the importance of that ability in poetics) I ask:

Why is being male or female "stuck"?
Why is it a "handicapped zone"?
Why is Todd seemingly apologizing for being male?
Are we perhaps to become ambi-sexual and aware of all possible gender
perspectives at once?

Look: I like Alan Jennifer's work a lot, but surely one of its virtues
is the perception that IDENTIFICATIONS ARE ODIOUS (which is perhaps one
of the reasons I've always felt uneasy with "identity politics"). I like
SPUNK myself; a certain liveliness and intractability, no matter what
sex it emanates from. I myself am "of the male gender" (gag) -- and
white besides. I understand that white males are over-privileged in
American society (but not only that society -- in fact, LEAST of all in
that society). Moreover, I understand that sometimes I exercise these
privileges unconsciously. There are, to my great misfortune, innumerable
things that I assume unconsciously. No doubt some of these things are
related to my maleness and whiteness. No doubt my whiteness and maleness
determine many of the decisions I make in my life and, more than that,
many of the decisions I make in my poems.

But folks . . .

GIVE ME A BREAK!

Maybe I'm just too much of an old Marxist, but the impersonal economic
forces of capitalism seem to me to determine us in a far more
comprehensive and degrading way than what sex we happen to be
inhabiting. To take an example from the membership of this list, the
denial of Joe Amato's tenure (and his postings explaining his perception
of that action) are far more alarming than the limitations of "the male
gaze." This is just an opinion, limited in universal applicability like
any other feeling or opinion. But why should I apologize for my
perceptions? Why should ANY OF US APOLOGIZE?

And furthermore . . . how can it BE that NOBODY cares if a fucking POET
is A MEMBER OF THE FBI!!!


"But yes--the forms--hmmmmm....are masculine
and such--"

Jesus.

Maybe there's a REASON so few people go to poetry readings in L.A! (I
don't mean to criticize you personally, Todd; I don't know you or your
magazine, and you're more than likely a good guy and a fine poet; I hope
you understand it's a style of rhetoric I'm objecting to here).

And you know, Bukowski was an asshole, but he wrote one or two good
poems!

Forever, I guess, in the _derrier garde_ (though I like Rachel Daley's
post a lot),

if anyone is still with me

Asapsychologistindisguisehere I am aware that there is a particular verbal
therapy that is the treatment of choice for a class of disorders.
Neurochemical treatments also work.  The fascinating thing here is that the
verbal therapy produces the same neurophisical changes on the same brain
sites that the neurochemical treatments do.  Does this mean that one or
the other should be given a priority or are they essentially the same?
Does language or neurochemicals "really" produce the change?

Todd Baron:

I must start off by saying Buk. NEVER wrote a good poem--sorry--I am not
in favor of

a) poor writing and silliness in the name drunken stupidity and
ill-defined post-beat romanticism
b) HE is a mysoginist idiot! (Phew!)
being "stuck' has to do with our discussion of (bad spelling...er..)
gender roles and structures in poetics. If one is aware of a gender role
or gender model--then I believe on is "stuck" within the defintion and
confinement of terminology. I do not believe tho that one is punished or
"jailed" as in "stuck in prision..stuck in my room". The thing is that
"stuck" is structure--if one identifies patterns as either male or
female--but I agree with others when they notice that structures in
poetics are male--in that they derive from male poets and male
narratives--how else would the Epic, the sonnet, etc. have found their
way here--now--in their forms.  Your Marxist response negates that
economics is gender and age (and race)  based also. Very much so--are
structures of Marxism (poor ms. marx and his daughters) and Capitalist
Democracy/etc ("Free Market") based on a male pattern (baldness?) power
elite-thus yes economics determine us--BUT--those economics are not--are
not ---"impersonal economic forces..." --

never impersonal.

Joel Kuszai asked me, a long while ago, to post something on Steve
Dickison's Naropa Lecture.  Lemmesay first that Steve did a beautiful
thing for the opening panel, which was to approach the issue of
Community/Performance/Publishing topic through the Jazz performance
scene of the Bay Area, which has been taken  back or over by the
musicians themselves creating relationships which are direct, no middle
developer.
This Steve posed in comparison to some venues in Europe that are
subsidized by generous art funding but end up with small scattered
audience that fail to provide the critical mass necessary for vibrancy.
This double edged sword was embodied for us by Kai Nieminem, who was
thrilled at the energetic poet's dialogue here but who was only able to
get to Naropa through the funding of the Finnish Bureau of Culture, an
entity, it was observed, that doesn't have an equal here, unless you
consider the international marketing of Armagedon to be such an equal.

As for Steve's lecture I can only by very subjective in terms of what I
remember.  He raised the question of independence in publishing, whether
it was possible in a time when even the smallest press must arrange
their marketing to serve the systems of Barnes and Noble and Borders.
For example, if presses don't print a computer scanner thing, they can
expect their books to get stuck with a large marring sticker--which will
come back on the returned books. Small Press Distribution's sales, he
told us, had gone up 50%, largely because B&N in their effort to beat
Amazon in being the World's Largest, had ordered 2 of everything for
their warehouse.  Raising all sorts of issues.  On one hand the access
of largeness has enabled a proliferation of small presses, on the other
a devastation of small bookstores.

LIke I said, all this raises much.  Sorry the report is so short so
late.

Good example, henry -- in the Odyssey -- who weaves?  Penelope or Homer?
Arachne weaves -- but who weaves the myths of Penelope and Arachne?

I know it's ridiculous to try to get down to first causes, to try to
separate what's "man-made" and "woman-made" (preferring this to masc/fem)

a 2nd wave feminist would Re-Vision these weaving myths to give
penelope more autonomy, perhaps make her less chaste, etc.
(cf Rukeyser "No more masks! No more mythologies")

A post-feminist read -- necessarily post-structuralist -- would recognize
the myth of penelope woven into, and inseparable from, the frames other
(man-made) myths.

Weaving -- the technique, the writing strategy --  is neither masculine
nor feminine -- Forms are neither masculine nor feminine (an extension
of Waldrop's claim that language is neutral).  Forms are not masculine but
the construction of literary history, the way we view forms, is -- I think
it's time feminist scholarship came to grips with its limitations on this
front.

i was pointing the gendering of forms as a problem of feminist scholarship
(at one point necessary)  -- a reduction that perhaps "prohibits"
male writers also from assuming a "gendered" relationship to literary
history -- which perhaps frames all men as complicit in maintianing this
oppressive history

But steve poses some very important questions. I believe--and the
discussion not that long ago here abt. the LA or any local "scene"
--that we must begin again to redefine ways of distribution and
publishing for the many many small(er) presses that exist--from
magazines to books. Carolyn Kemp and I do ReMap as only by sub. but we
don't want to--even distribution sources that might take our magazine
are frenzied and incoherent enugh to scare us--I'd rather give the mag.
away (as I have...) to true readers and participants in the porject than
have to wait 1 year for small sums. What do we do? How do we--also as
poets--get work published?  I have been "lucky" enough to work with some
very fine presses (O Books, texture, Avenue B..etc) but now I have
several manuscripts I would like to see pubished--and how and where. I
always feel sheepish sending to presses I have no working relationship
with--but must. Direct co-relation to Steve's work--steve's
workshop--lectures--(as I understand them from Steve, too) that it's
time we think of ourselves in much the same manner as other arts
communities. Bands start off small but gain a public if they're good
(>?<) enough, etc. I'd love to hear more on what everyone else in the
world thinks about

a) dist. and publishing of mags and books
b) getting work published and (AND) supporting small(er) publishing
houses.

Todd Baron wants insights into

a) dist. and publishing of mags and books
b) getting work published and (AND) supporting small(er) publishing
houses.

a)  Well, as far as I can tell, outside the bustling matrices of SF & NY
(etc), magazines publishing avant-garde poetry & really vital poetics come
in two very general varieties.  There's the glossy/perfect-bound mag. with
a dependable stable of "established" poets representing their latest
leading up to its publication in glossy/perfect-bound book form, often in
tandem or under the umbrella of an institution, such as a university.
These magazines, to my mind, often do not or cannot take the sorts of
risks of the second brand;  There is a glut of little "experimental"
magazines, such as my own or yours, Todd, that can often develop their own
stable of authors, but will more often take risks with "emerging" writers,
since those with the capital (economic and cultural) to wind up an
"important" source of cultural and economic viability, vibrancy, would
consider the cottage-industry mag.s' stable of authors "emerging" so long
as they allow themselves to be seen in the company of unknowns.  I make
this admittedly clumsy distinction to make the point that poets &
"poeticians" like any other practitioner in a capital economics will run
with their own crowd, because one cannot generally afford the other.  In
other words, what is vital to one community is often misinterpreted as
aesthetic posturing, or mere pretense, in another.  Anyone publishing
independently must first decide what that means as far as procedural
concerns go, distribution, marketing, format, then realize that, should
you fall into the second category, this provides you a not unique but
happy nonetheless opportunity to cross those borders, as far as whom you
choose to represent in your pages.  Engaged authors produce work which
will engage in such a dialogic configuration.  Thus, hopefully, the work
will carry the mag. into the hands of an audience(s).

b)  Thus, hopefully, the work will carry the author into the magazine of
an audience.

This makes me think of Ann Douglas' books, _Feminization of American
Culture_, and _Terrible Honesty_ - and how modernist poets (Pound,
Williams especially) were part of a general cultural reaction against
the "suffocating genteel Victorian"(& white) feminism of the later 19th
century - and how Pound's "breaking of forms" (all the little effete
sonnet men) was a macho thing - so that the sonnet was a feminine form
(in his mind, at that time), feminine = effete, genteel, soft -

but women writing sonnets in the 19th century was maybe a feminist thing
to do - and I wonder how much the dissociated, experimental, post-Poundian,
postmodern forms illustrate a repeat of this pattern - women "appropriating"
"masculine" forms - but too late; there always seems to be a late-arriving
avant-garde ready to lead their disciples & acolytes further into a
dead-end wilderness supposedly "new" - (just trying to be provocative)

these things are just too durn complicated!! There are at least
three/four levels: the personal/artistic, which is a person working out of
a semi-damaged personal psyche into artistic form; there is the legal/political
, where a society tries to control/compromise/negotiate social peace; and
there is the intellectual/theoretical, where all the personal/artistic issues
are hashed out and analyzed in the sociological/objective abstract (both
helping and screwing up the other levels in the process) -

and the men poets weave their appropriated forms into a shroud around
the actual weavers themselves -

Rah rah.

I'm glad to see Safdie Joseph annoyed with the
"position" that feminism had seemed to put Todd in (in reading the
original post, before Todd's brilliant comeback) -- as
an apologist.  Elizabeth Treadwell makes the same point as well (though I
have definite issues with Postfeminist Playground, for another post).

I wish we could just do away with the gender essentialism  which causes so
many with physical bodies to feel they have to apologize for some
appendage or other.  I'm intrigued by the problems women (and other
'others') face in trying to enter the current the forums/debates etc.
-- very material problems (as Woolf pointed out early on) rooted in
patriarchal biases.

But it's more fruitful to continue mucking things up, to keep getting
more and more challenging writing published, to continue framing
experiment as a  rupture of "patriarchal laws" (Kristeva's argument; what
Woolf recognized as "convention," what Bernstein has called "populist
realism" etc) -- to recognized that oppression is at work, even that
gender oppression is at work, but to quite calling the
counter/re/active strategies "feminine"! or to call it feminine and stop
stop linking this to (women's) biology!  Or we all really do have the
Anxiety of Influence -- we're all a bundle of nerves!

Until we get some intelligent conversation going
to reframe the issues (and reframe them for feminist literary scholarship)
we're going to be beaten over the heads with said appendages. (Not that it
isn't out there -- Judith Butler, for example -- But to what extent has it
made its way into contemporary poetics discussions?)

Subject:      Michael Basinski reviews The Unspeakable Rooms
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

I have just received the following review from Michael D. Basinski (poet,
critic, Rare Books/Poetry Librarian etc) of State University of New York
at Buffalo. The two previous reviews posted have been about the performance
in Cleveland, Ohio. Special thanks to Taylor Brady (Stratch and
Dent/Cartograffiti) for organising the gig.

"I recently had occasion to watch and hear the work of sound poet Alaric
Sumner and performer Rory McDermott in my home town of Buffalo, New York
at the HallWalls Contemporary Art Center (22nd May 1998). The evening
featured two works
by Sumner. The first, 'error studies and portraits', was a multi-voice,
conversation poem carried on between Sumner and McDermott. Certainly,
this was interesting because multi-voice presentation poetry looms a
major avant garde technique. Sumner's sound poems weave literally
philosophy with the aural. The form it manifests exists in a matrix of
poetics and sound. It was a pleasure to hear this burgeoning form worked
by a poet whose ear is well tuned and whose intellect can manipulate the
multi-voice tool to form poetry.
        "In retrospect, this first piece acted as a prolog and introduction to
the second piece of the evening, 'The Unspeakable Rooms'. This was a
more physical piece that featured McDermott strenuously and emotionally,
passionately moving in front of a screen on which was projected
McDermott passionately moving. The sound tract was McDermott's reading,
rendering of Sumner's text. Perfectly balanced it was strenuous,
riveting performance. McDermott miming himself on film ranged through a
host of emotions. As a poetic piece, as a poem, one was constantly aware
of the dual qualities of language. Language is both the material of
meaning and a veil surrounding meaning. The two McDermotts, one real and
one a real film, became a metaphor of this constant and irreconcilable
struggle. Beyond this, of course, as poem it was a tactile event,
therefore, much new in the realm of the poem.
        "Both pieces were extremely interesting and engaging and the evening
will stick long in my mind because of the challenge it posed to
contemporary poetry. That challenge was to become tactile yet
intellectually philosophical. The team of Sumner and McDermott seem to
be the best operating this day in this opening arena."

Enquires about bookings to:
a.sumner@dartington.ac.uk
or phone: +44   (0) 1803 867829

JPEG screen dumps from the video made during the Buffalo performance are
available as attachments on request (they are not of the highest quality
but give a good sense of the visual impact.)

The piece's requirements are:
space: 12ft wide x 9ft tall white wall or screen (performance is end on, so
audience should not be too far to the sides of the 12 ft)
blackout
video projector (high quality single beam)
video player (SVHS ideally, VHS ok)
cd player
good sound system (for vocal range)

The piece has been designed with art galleries in mind and does not require
conventional performance spaces (though they accommodate it perfectly
well).

University venues particularly welcome (especially with educational
sessions (workshop/lecture) attached on the piece/performance
writing/collaboration, etc). A future issue of PAJ (Performing Arts
Journal, published by Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, USA) will
include the text of The Unspeakable Rooms in a section I have edited on
(live) Performance Writing. Their web site is at:
http://calliope.jhu.edu/journals/performing_arts_journal/

It looks as if we have a London Venue for The Unspeakable Rooms in late
September. More details shortly. Other venues in October and November in
Leeds, Devon and Cornwall.

If that was a "brilliant" comeback, Linda (and where, indeed, would Todd
be coming back from?) the word doesn't mean what I thought it meant.
Speculations as to Mrs. Marx aside, the economic system is no respecter
of persons.

I appreciate that you seem to be wrestling with something and I hope you
and others continue to produce the challenging work that would help
illuminate the problems as you see them. (Is "patriarchal" really so
much a better word than "masculine"?)

Here's an excerpt from this month's Harper's from one William Phillips,
which deals a bit with what I said last night . . .

"I've been wondering where the ideas and movements on the left today
come from. They do not have their source in either Marx or Lenin, yet
they are deemed by the left itself to be authentic, especially in the
academy. . . .

1.      Cultural diversity. Neither Marx nor Lenin was interested in any
kind of cultural diversity. Lenin supported the various nationalisms in
Russia, but that was mainly a part of his revolutionary strategy.
2.      Gay liberation. Neither Marx nor Lenin had the slightest
interest in homosexuality of any kind. . . . And certainly they had no
notion of an "alternative lifestyle."
3.      Radical feminism. Neither Marx nor Lenin was especially
concerned with feminism, though they did not directly oppose it. What
they actually believed was that no questions concerning feminism could
be adequately solved under capitalism, and that only under socialism
would people be free of prejudice or bigotry. And women would be equal
to men in all respects.
4.      Gender studies. Marx and Lenin, of course, never heard of what
are called gender studies. But obviously they would not have had the
slightest interest in them and would have thought of them as
intellectual and political distractions.

Etc., etc. He makes a few cheap rhetorical points at the end, but I was
most interested in his No. 3 above. That is, speculations about gender
don't HAVE to be "intellectual and political distractions" . . . they
can be linked with other pursuits, some of which I would certainly hope
would be poetic and economic. I would repeat, again, my post of last
week -- it's the existence of money that makes it impossible to sustain
an "epic" view of the world.

(And speaking of persons, my FIRST name is Joseph.)

        Rah rah.

        I'm glad to see Safdie Joseph annoyed with the
        "position" that feminism had seemed to put Todd in (in reading
the
        original post, before Todd's brilliant comeback) -- as
        an apologist.  Elizabeth Treadwell makes the same point as well
(though I
        have definite issues with Postfeminist Playground, for another
post).

        I wish we could just do away with the gender essentialism  which
causes so
        many with physical bodies to feel they have to apologize for
some
        appendage or other.  I'm intrigued by the problems women (and
other
        'others') face in trying to enter the current the forums/debates
etc.
        -- very material problems (as Woolf pointed out early on) rooted
in
        patriarchal biases.

        But it's more fruitful to continue mucking things up, to keep
getting
        more and more challenging writing published, to continue framing
        experiment as a  rupture of "patriarchal laws" (Kristeva's
argument; what
        Woolf recognized as "convention," what Bernstein has called
"populist
        realism" etc) -- to recognized that oppression is at work, even
that
        gender oppression is at work, but to quite calling the
        counter/re/active strategies "feminine"! or to call it feminine
and stop
        stop linking this to (women's) biology!  Or we all really do
have the
        Anxiety of Influence -- we're all a bundle of nerves!

        Until we get some intelligent conversation going
        to reframe the issues (and reframe them for feminist literary
scholarship)
        we're going to be beaten over the heads with said appendages.
(Not that it
        isn't out there -- Judith Butler, for example -- But to what
extent has it
        made its way into contemporary poetics discussions?)

        Todd's comeback:

        > being "stuck' has to do with our discussion of (bad
spelling...er..)
        > gender roles and structures in poetics. If one is aware of a
gender role
        > or gender model--then I believe on is "stuck" within the

weird. I meant simply that as response to the statement earlier made
that "economics are impersonal" that that was wrong. Economics are
Gender and Race and Age based. This must enter into a discussion of
gender based writing--what keeps poets where they're kept in the class
system--and writers--and visual artists--etc."--and that economics being
gender based (etc)  the question must focus on /more/econmics than
simply form and function.  Marx would not have thought gender studies
were "distractions" had they been presented in this manner--He well
understood who got paid for what/etc. And Reich (let's get going here)
focused much attention on economic constraints primarilly placed on
women and child in relation to sex/gender based roles. THAT"S the reason
he got kicked out of the Communist party--he wanted to break down the
standard economic roles that capitalism AND communism was placing on
women and children. esp.

Tb
 the poem has possibilities like this, also.

Hi all-

   Ron mentioned that Poetry Daily is featuring a poem of mine on their
website
(www.poems.com) on Saturday.  Disconcertingly, I've just heard now (for the
first time)  from them and it seems what they're planning to do is post the
second half of a two part poem. So what will show up there isn't complete.
That makes the experience even stranger.

FEATURE-''Air rage'' on the rise on U.S., other airlines


            By Diana Fairechild
            KAUAI, Hawaii (Reuters) - Blame it on a lack of oxygen or
being packed like sardines in a can, but ``air rage'' is on the
rise.
            In well-publicized incidents, airline passengers have
defecated on food carts, been aggressive with the crew and even
sexually assaulted their seats. Airline travel once was
exclusively for a more refined jet set, but these days flying
has become a perilous proposition.
            Unruly behavior in the skies has been increasing at an
astonishing rate in both numbers and the level of hostility. A
recent report by the International Cabin Crew Association
showed a rise of about 400 percent in incidents since 1995.
            In early July, the ICCA, the International Transport
Federation and the International Federation of Airline Pilots
issued a joint statement saying airlines should adopt a policy
of prosecuting all offenders. They also called for a blacklist
of offenders and said airlines should ensure there is restraint
equipment such as plastic handcuffs aboard all planes.
            In 1996, banker Gerard Finneran was fined $50,000 after he
assaulted an attendant and then defecated on a first-class food
cart during a Buenos Aires-to-New York flight.
            More recently, a man on a Northwest Airlines flight removed
his pants and ``simulated having sex with the back of his
seat,'' airline officials reported. And a man on a flight to
Honolulu ``allegedly urinated on the seats,'' then punched
another passenger who told him to stop.
            Other incidents include passengers becoming enraged after
being asked if their seat-belts were fastened and crews being
attacked for trying to put trays back in the upright position.
            The problem is not just an American one.
            In 1995 a large group of British and Irish tourists ran amok
aboard a trans-Atlantic flight after being denied more alcohol.
The drunken tourists sent their children to steal more drink
from service carts, attacked other passengers and pelted the
crew with food until they were overcome by some wrestlers
aboard, giving the entire incident a three-ring circus flavor.

            BOUND AND GAGGED
            Airline crews have been forced to take drastic measures. A
British Airways passenger who ``improperly touched a flight
attendant'' this year was bound with handcuffs and duct tape by
the crew and subsequently fined $11,000. Another passenger was
tied up with a headset cord by United Airlines crew members
after he disturbed the flight.
            Japan Airlines also has given flight attendants permission
to tie up unruly and raucous passengers. The airline issued the
edict last year after incidents on its planes more than doubled
between 1995 and 1996. JAL said its crew members had been
stabbed with pens, had their buttocks and breasts groped and
were even forced to get on their hands and knees to apologize
for bringing drinks late to some drunken passengers.
            Experts say the airline equivalent of road rage is a complex
problem with many contributory factors. It could simply be a
reflection of increased violence in society, but there may be
other underlying issues triggering the rise in unruliness.
            Some medical experts blame the cabin environment, which they
say is high in toxic chemicals and allergens and low in air
pressure and oxygen.
            ``Curtailment of fresh air in airplanes can be causing
deficient oxygen in the brain of passengers, and this often
makes people act belligerent, even crazy,'' said Dr. Vincent
Mark, an environmental physician in Santa Cruz, California.
            The link between air rage and poor air quality may deserve a
closer look. Passenger unruliness began to rise some 20 years
ago, coinciding with the cost-cutting practice of using recycled
air instead of fresh air in passenger cabins.

            SARDINE-CLASS SEATING
            Another possible culprit, high on the list of irritations
for airline passengers, is cramped ``sardine seating.'' Airline
seats are now as small as seats on subway trains, and with many
flights lasting longer passengers feel they are packed in like
sardines in a can, or chickens in crowded cages. Is it any
wonder they peck peevishly at those around them?
            Airline executives point the finger in part at excess
luggage. In recent testimony before Congress one blamed an
explosion in the number and size of bags passengers carry on.
            But critics say airlines themselves have contributed to the
problem by removing coat closets, leaving little room for
garment bags. And with eight percent of all airline baggage lost
or stolen, travelers are increasingly reluctant to check their
luggage.
            While Congress and the airlines think about ways to fix the
problem, here are a few tips if you find yourself on a flight
with an unruly passenger:
            -- Rather than confront the offender directly, leave your
seat and seek out the purser or senior flight attendant. The
purser is usually found in first class, so bypass the flight
attendants in coach.
            -- Give the purser the row and seat number of the unruly
passenger. Remain calm and communicate clearly.
            -- If you have a tendency to be an unruly passenger
yourself, keep in mind that the trip is a challenge for everyone
on board. Tolerance and polite gestures could make your flights
more pleasant for you and everyone around you.

I think this is the greatest mystery - the relation of the symbolic to the
neurophysiological - how certain words, certain orders, can bring on chem-
ical depression, neurosis, even death, how voudou operates, hypnosis; we
live half-in, half-out the symbolic - we're cluttered by it...

"The concerted effort around 1950 to reduce human affairs to positive
science or techniques and technologies led to mislabeling that made much
of what was said and done in connection with psychoanalysis absurd. We
encounter a similar bias toward techniques, positivism, and reductionism
in various forms at the meetings: in the enthusiasm for interpreting
existential issues in terms of mathematical decision theory and game
theory; in the mislabeling of the political World Federation for Mental
Health as a scientific organization; in the reference to psychology as
"behavioral science"; in Northrop's replacement of the actual social and
political events by logical systems; in Stroud's technical fix to deal
with the dangers of nuclear annihilation. This mislabeling is the
earmark of not only the Macy meetings but of the postwar era in the
United States....
The taboo, around 1950, against tracing the origins of psychological
suffering to political and economic conditions and seeking to alter
them, the "social amnesia" (to borrow Jacoby's phrase) of
psychotherapists, was itself part of the political climate."---from The

Harry Mathews is certainly alive.

As are some of the ones whose names I dont know. But of course Perec and
Queneau and Calvino are all gone.

I cite my book _Red Hats_ , published in 1986 but written years earlier

uncalled-for equivocation, thus bringing in the next sentence. One of the
more impressive facts of the Free Speech Movement at UC Berkeley was that
once the protests began, the number of students seeking psychiatric help
dipped sharply -- dramatically, I'd say.

Henry asks about all those 'feminine' sonneteers of the 19th century & the
male macho response to them, but I immediately think of one 19th century
woman poet, Emily Dickinson, & how powerful her 'influence' on men as well
as women is in the late 20th century. Not with sonnets either (& I know,
her work wasn't 'present' in its time).

With regard to gender in writing: it would probably seem a country-minded
thing to say, but couldn't it nevertheless be said, that gender is a given,
ineluctably there in whomever's writing? But, then, even if 'we' were to
agree to such a simple statement, we still might add that the really
interesting question is whether or no the writing (& the writer?)
interrogates the concept of gender both _in_ & _by_ its formal
strategies...?

Dickinson's NOT writing in sonnets was a comment on the conventional
writing of her time, ahead of the (sexist?) critiques of a later time.
Society struggling along cleans the slate, and what was dominant (sentimental

Don't agree that Dickinson's writing was a "comment" at all--
just tht she did not write in the conventional form--but
not as a comment--she didn't live in a world
she was against.... Let's not make her
a warrior. She did follwo the voices she heard
on the page and the occasional church hymn (written by men) and of

Two people have responding (sort of) to Maria's inquiry about Oulipo.
They simply mentioned a few names of folks who are (either) living or
dead...

The other part of her question was whether the group still has any ongoing
existence qua group: whether anyone oulipan still meets.  That to me is
the interesting part of the question.  If they ceased as a group entity,
when did they do so?  and similar gossipy inquiries....

The lists of membership i have seen, and group photos, show how perfectly
they reflected (at one time, certainly) the assumptions of the world of
letters pre-1970:  a reasonably large bunch of writers, and they were *all
men*...Can anyone indicate if they ever eventually had a woman member? (or
two?)

In support of David's contention, Human Behavior magazine once ran a
piece on how depression and suicide decreased dramatically in West
Belfast when riots were in full swing: "Suicides Down. Since their
neighborhood turned into a battleground, fewer of the downhearted haved
moved to end their own lives. The mean suicide figures for both men and
women in 1970 were almost half the mean for the years 1964-69." Of
course, the psychiatric reasons given for the decline are inane. The
Belfastians, who were immersed historically in their condition, have
simply identified the cause of their 'depression' and attempted to
eliminate it.---Rosalie Gancie (By the way the original quotes as well
as the quotes from the passed few months are from Carlo Parcelli who
abuses my e-mail in my name. Of course, he hastens to add his agreement
to David's post).

I'm not so sure about this. If you mean that she didn't live in that world
I would agree: she didn't [she lived in a little room upstairs]. If you
mean that she wasn't against it, I think that you'd be completely wrong:
for she was as against it as they come, and all of her work says so, don't
you think?

As for Henry's remarks lately, they continue to entertain and inform me.
Thanks again, Henry.

Meow Press is pleased to announce the publication of its 50th and 51st
chapbooks, Benjamin Friedlander's _Selected Poems_ and Don Cheney's _The
Qualms of Catullus & K-mart_.

Benjamin Friedlander's _Selected Poems_ contains poems from manuscripts
completed in 1990 in Oakland through writing done in Buffalo this year,
and includes selections from _Anterior Future_ (Meow Press, 1993) and  _A
Knot is Not a Tangle_ (Meow Press, 1995). With cover art by Armando
Billitteri. 44pg. $6

Don Cheney's _The Qualms of Catullus & K-mart_ includes 27 poems from the
full length work. In a comment about this book on the Poetics List, Bill
Luoma notes: "Don is a skilled prose writer, so in his hands you get
a real nasty & hilarious narrative, as you get in Catullus & Propertius,
but you also get great sound. Whereas in Zukofsky's homophones, eg, you
for the most part just get great sound, with the nasty humors
subordinate." Selected by Bill Luoma. Cover art by Rose Anne Raphael.
32pg. $6.

I need to think on a little more, but I felt uncomfortable measuring one
against the other -- as Todd points out they're so integrally related.
Didn't mean to misread or offend.   I'm really enjoying this discussion.
Sorry I have to sign off for a couple of days for a long weekend in the
Bay Area!

    Has anybody here read Yau's new Black Sparrow book?
    In it, there is much "cross-gendered identification"
    that---though it is written by a male--seems to, er,
    "rupture patriarchal discourse" and could serve as
    a complement to, say, Carla Harryman who also engages
    in "cross-gendered" identification. I think Yau does
    a very good job at trying to speak AS woman "other"
    and negotiating the representational anxieties that
    might attend the "presumption" of such a task.....
    but would be very interested to hear opposing views....

Haven't read the Yau but I often teach Harryman's "In The Mode Of" to my
students, a gender bending masterpiece to be sure.   -m.

   I am ABSOLUTELY SURE that Dickinson has at least some poems
   that pretty blatantly (and more that do it more subtly) write
   AGAINST the society woman role, and marriage. Sure, they are
   also FOR something, but it's not always just the occult.....

Chris,

What time does the party start and how many ROOF BOOKS will you have for
sale? Shall I bring a banana for Hannah? A salami for Tommy?

Does everyone eat when they come to your house?

- it is pretty easy to read your own concerns into somebody's work, and
pretend authorial intention is meaningless or not worth trying to
understand.  In that sense I agree with you that saying Dickinson was
"making a statement" about sonneteering & other forms of "pop" literature
without any historical record to that effect is just that kind of
misreading-chatterteering.  But I do think that when she sent her poems
to Higginsworth [name right?] she was "testing the waters" in more ways
than one - and when she found them wanting, her whole approach became
"at war" with conventional literary activity in them days.  - Henry G

Poem #199 - "I'm Wife - I've finshed that" - is one that backs you up

Dear Ms. Chris Stroffolino,

what exactly do you mean by "cross-gendered identification"

And how does this imply a form of newness? For example:
Tom Gunn's "All my sad captains" or the guy who wrote
the quote both fit the above generalized parameter.How is
speaking as woman with Yau different than Browning, in your
estimation?

Be well

Hi everyone -- getting ready to set nomail for my last

I'll see it, but it's worth a shot.
        oh, and does anybody know what-the-hell time is

Dear Rae,

I should be around, just back from Buffalo and also just about to leave for
Buffalo, as usual!

I think your best best is James: it is rarely at his place over the weekend.

sherryj@msn.com  is his work email, which I think he will get sooner that his
home email.

If that doesn't work, let me know.

Since one of the characteristics of electronic textual space is that there is
no real scarsity of  "space" -- it wouldn't cost anything more to post your
whole poem, then the Poetry Daily thing is even more odd. Anyway, I had never
heard of the site till Ron mentioned it --

Love,

Charles

I think I missed the mutation of the subject line,
but I did have much fun trying to pronounce it.

Regarding Marx & feminism -- this is one of those old
faultlines that shows up every now and then, with lots
of bourgeois namecalling mixed in. Class and gender
don't get mixed up too much, although it is important
to note the "commodification" of women in society,
as well as their lack of a salary for work. In a sense,
a woman is the asymptotic point of the proletariat,
reduced to being supplied with just enough material
compensation to sustain her labor (pun perhaps intended.)

I went to a great Judith Butler lecture in the Fall
on Antigone and gender -- a wonderful Hegelian analysis
of the positon of Antigone relative to the emerging
"Marxist" (meaning "predicted by Marx") aristocratic
society of Ancient Greece. In many ways, women are placed
anterior to considerations of class; they are perceived
as lilliths preceeding the creation of economic production.
The position of Lillith is interesting, in any case;
before the initiation of the Old Testament, she's a spectre
in her own right. Communism may haunt from the future,
but gender perhaps hearkens from the past.

Regarding the sonnet form; while women may choose to embody
notions of "effeminacy" by writing prissy poems, one of
the most interesting convergences of political and literary
history is the connection between resurgent interest in
the "primitive" in literature (e.g., Russia in the '10s)
and the "woman question".

I haven't been able to keep up with all the posts on the
subject, so I apologise if I'm a few hours (minutes?) out
of phase.

Back to Elizabeth's fecund post:

www.pfplayground.com

I felt I was dismissive of POSTFEMINIST PLAYGROUND -- which I honestly
hadn't looked at for quite a while -- great graphics!, very smart with a
current essay by DODIE BELLAMY that's cool.  Part of what IS attractive is
the "no more victims/no more apologies" angle.  But I really felt when I'd
met Lily James and Susannah Breslin (at a Conference (of all places) over
2 years ago), who were powerful presences, that they were sort of
forging onward somewhat narrowly. PFPlayground has grown into something
major & I appreciate they're grappling with Post-Femininsm, though it's
not quite what I have in mind . . .

Elizabeth, as the archives aren't arranged by author, what's the shortcut
to some of your stuff?

I hope so but doubt it, and Yes, most definately.  The world we live in is
so gendered, & though there's a lot of wonderful blurriness, there's still
those two extremes.  Am I referring to "man & wife"?  or Christian
Fundamentalism and The Gap?

Good points about having more freedom to mess around in the symbolic, so
to speak.  But I find the play-only attitude (pfp's primary attitude) to
be a little shortsighted and breezy.  Maybe I'm just getting old.
I mean their use of breasty characters may be ironic, funny, or
empowering, but I still feel like the mass of those images, while creating
a ambiguous message (are they sexy?  are they coming on to ME?  they're
just drawings!  Is that Angie Dickinson?!), are, well, like too much --
feels to much like oppression!  advertising!  I don't "identify" with
those images. . . what's wrong with me.  I mean I just can't strike such
an ironic posture towards them as they do towards me.  Maybe they're
supposed to make me feel "uncomfortable"?

Actually, that quote is only 10 years old, but still "hindsight" --
foremost was the formal problem, the hindsight is her realization that the
tackling that particular formal problem WAS related to her gender.

I recently read something of Yau's in a mag--was it First Intensity? I'm
sorry--I can't recall, but it was perhaps from the new book & was the narrative
of a stripper & I found it rather disturbing in that the narrator was kind of
dumb & angry & thought highly of her breasts (no prob with that in & of itself)
& little of men in general--she was kind of a jaded line drawing of a
woman--with the interior monolog of a stereotype, which I suppose is okay,
though as this thread goes to show, the whole male/female or masc/fem question
is much more complex than Yau's piece implied, and I guess I just felt annoyed
that he was willing to throw another stereotype my way.

        A poet who is cop. Saves the good from the bad.  Nice combo.
        Thanks to PD James. Why not? And why not poets who
        who are patriarchal, monarchists;
        Dostoevski - at the end years, a believer in the Orthodox.
        Why the assumption that poets must believe in feminisms,
        or be non-patriarchal. Poets, can be anything they want.
        Long as they write poetry. They don't need or have
        to justify anything . The rest is about being a citizen.

        Besides , who says Patriarchy is bad?

        What is wrong with the Father?

        That is not wrong with the Mother?
        Joyce, from the evidence one gathers inthe Wake,

        was a catholic, a patriarch, and indeed a fine and great writer.

        'Et tant d'autres et tant d'autres.'


        and please dont say Dostoevski was not a poet,

        just because he wrote novels.

        That means Joyce was not a poet.

        O yes I realize that Finnegans Wake is different.

        I like the last word 'the'

        who was it said: the unexamined life is not worth living?

        like wise: the unexamined assumptions.

        For over 30 years the Papa has been attacked in one shape form
        or another.

        fair enough. But now the tables are turning.

        "the best lack all conviction,  while the worst/
         are filled with passionate intensity."


        So one sees the poetics built so far onto a political need

        to 'justify' [a disgusting practice which smacks of protestant
        secular thought'] one's position,

        that the poetry  has gone off the deep end of a reterritorialized
        liberalism.

        it is very sad to know that eliot's poems were kept

        out of Poems for the Millennium because of financial constraints.

the epistemes required a fiction which stood en place for centuries....


        so imagine a patriarchy which is poetic anarchic

Sermon on the Mount by Jennifer


The Real is so stupid and Insignificant, I am saying under the sign of
Clement Rosset do you know him? That it is inert, dull, repetitious and
Full of our Meanderings. So that We do not Face Face, that is a Moment
of what might be a Considerable grain, have you looked at Face up close
and then Wondered how your Theories fall apart in the Proof? Because I
cannot Do this for too Long, this Look at the Up-Close Face, I mean the
first Thing you Notice are Pores and other Holes everywhere There and
in the Middle of such Hairs as you will never See at a Distance. So is
that an Unknown Horror to Dream of and not to Disparage as you might on
a fair Day from a Distance. You will know what I mean. It is never or
Nary a Code, Nary or Never a Discourse, when you are that Close that
it is as if the Bed left Marks impervious. I am Talking to You. Those
impervious Marks. You will look at Stains up close, why there are Stains
on this very Chair upon which I am sitting, Leaks from my Panties, you
will know how Stupid the real is, you can almost Smell it. Up Close
Like a Gulliver wandering, then I know you will Know the World which is
what Surrounds you. Then and Precisely then, When you can Speak, Then
you Will be ushered into Silence, nary a Thing to Say. Thus I might say
from a Distance, you will have been Done to by the World, but you must
Know, if the Last Thing, it is of your Doing.

I have not heard of recent Oulipo meetings. Outside of writings by Mathews
etc. the latest newsy thing I remember is Warren Motte's Primer published
by Nebraska in about 1986.

Of course, if one keeps track of what the Atlas people are publishing,
that's about the best one can do.

As to female members--one always notices their absence. Perhaps this is due
to the relatively (until recently) small percentage of women interested in
being mathematicians.

There is/was a member named Michele Metail. I dont know whether that first
name is French or Italian.

Emerging from the Unconscious of Civilization in our day  is the entire
gendering of power-abuse and unlevel playing fields. I appreciate yr
application of a logic to dismember this problem but it wont go away.
Neither by waving one's lily nor by cutting it off can one avoid the Penis
Wars. The penis (phallus, I guess) is the first offense. The inequity
starts there, whether it's a burden or an advantage. "He pulled her down
with his muscles." Just as was expected. The tact required is extensive and
really only realizable one-on-one (and even then . . .). Dont you really
think?  I hugely wish we could keep the personal out of the poetry, so it
could personally be _me_ not Emily Dickinson or TSE. But why didnt Eliot
get his double hernia fixed? Doesnt that detail open his poetry to a fuller
reading, a fuller recoil?  Poetry problematizes vividly the insolubles of
this firkin existence. With Beckett one wants an elegant absence of exit to
be one's exit but tomorrow someone will be in yr face, dammit. No wonder
all these pretty poems avoid the issue. Cash in on the issue. Skirt. I'm
with you Orpheus in yr Underground but I want you to stop looking back. Is
the light at the end of the tunnel, the tunnel? How about "Che faro senza
Eurydice"?  In Room 101, we can be disabused of that sort of love. In Room
101. What was Orwell's problem with rats? Kids keep them as pets. I know a
poet who shot them at the city dump. He was a good poet (naif disingenuous
statement).

Your second letter surprised me, and for a moment, swung - I had not

whose jingling cooled my Tramp - Perhaps the Balm, seemed better,
because you bled me, first.

I smile when you suggest that I delay "to publish" - that being foreign

If fame belonged to me, I could not escape her - if she did not, the
longest day would pass me on the chase - and the approbation of my Dog,

You think my gait "spasmodic" - I am in danger - Sir -

You think me "uncontrolled" - I have no Tribunal.

Would you have time to be the "friend" you should think I need? I have a

I. INTRODUCTION TO THIS LIST

        During the month or so since the Scholars, Artists, and Writers
for Social Justice Conference in Washington, DC, the new Coordinating
Committee has begun the process of reorganizing SAWSJ along the lines of
the new Consitution.  At this point the CC has asked me to set up this
SAWSJ information list on an experimental basis.  The goal of this list is
to encourage communication nationally among people -- whether SAWSJ
members or not -- working to rebuild the alliance between artists and
intellectuals on the one hand, and the multicultural workers' movement on
the other.
        The names and addresses on this list have been compiled from
several e-mail lists that SAWSJ developed during its first year.  There
are THREE PROBLEMS with the present list as it stands:
    1. It does not yet include the addresses of those who signed on at the
national conference -- apologies.
    2. There may be people who are on the list who do not want to receive
the list messages.  If this is the case for you, again, our apologies --
please write a short message in reply to this one asking to be removed,
and it will be done immediately.
    3. There are undoubtedly people who aren't on this list who
would like to join.  Please ask anyone in this situation to e-mail us at
the above address, and they will be added.
        As listed in "Contents" above, this message contains three
documents relating to the recent SAWSJ conference.  More information
on the conference and on SAWSJ in general is available on the SAWSJ web
site at http://www.sage.edu/html/SAWSJ (the last five letters MUST be
upper case).

                                In solidarity,

II. A REPORT ON THE NATIONAL LABOR TEACH-IN AND FIRST ANNUAL MEETING OF
SAWSJ, By Michael Denning and Steve Fraser for the SAWSJ Coordinating
Committee

        SAWSJ organized a national teach-in on "Democracy and the Right to
Organize" and convened its first annual meeting over the weekend of April
24-26 at George Washington University in Washington, D.C. It was a high
energy event of great promise. The vital work of taking on Corporate
America by mobilizing the academic and cultural communities in alliance
with the revitalized labor movement was carried a giant step forward by
the doings at GWU.
        Approximately 600 people assembled on the opening (Friday) night
to hear a diverse array of speakers. Julian Bond's presence as Moderator
for the evening was inspirational. His heroic role as a civil rights
leader helped establish the critical political and historic connections
that make the "Right to Organize" not only a vital issue for the labor
movement, but for all movements for social justice.  Three local
organizers - Betty Dumas of the Avondale Shipyards in New Orleans; Juan
Mazlymian, an abstestos worker from New York City; and Jonathan White, an
organizer of adjunct teachers at GWU - delivered compelling accounts from
the front lines about how imperilled the right to organize has become.
John Sweeney, President of the AFL-CIO, reiterated the Federation's warm
support for the work of SAWSJ, explaining how welcome the teach-in
movement has been in arousing public alarm over what he called "the Nike
economy".  Juliet Schor of Harvard University emphasized the "time famine"
which is putting both work and family life under unbearable stress,
arguing the need for SAWSJ to take up the battle against the corporate
seizure of "free time."  Robin Kelley of New York University, while
acknowledging the importance of SAWSJ's link to the labor movement, urged
the organization to embrace more actively the struggle against racism and
other social injustices. UCLA and Columbia University Law Professor
Kimberle Crenshaw focused her remarks on the concept of
"intersectionality"; namely the need, both intellectual and political, to
explore the connections between gender, race, and class.  Writer and
editor, Steve Fraser, spoke on behalf of SAWSJ, rehearsing the history of
the organization since the Columbia teach-in of 1996 (there have been over
30 teach-ins since then), and sketching SAWSJ's broadest principles and
purposes as it goes about the work of helping build a new culture of
solidarity.
        Saturday began with two series of panels and workshops. About 350
people circulated through an opening set of thematic panels: the future of
the teamsters, labor and political action, organizing the south,
organizing and the law, labor and social movements, anti-labor
legislation, lawsuits and ballot initiatives, international organizing,
and adjunct and graduate teacher organizing. A second set of "activist
workshops" followed:  organizing cultural workers, academic support for
unions, academic labor, the anti-sweatshop campaign, student labor action,
welfare and workfare, the work of the Economic Policy Institute, and Metro
Washington alliances.  Discussion in both panels and workshops was
intellectually vigorous, marked by a respect for the concrete, and
permeated by a sense of the potential for SAWSJ to grow and accomplish
much politically over the next months and years.
        That sense of down-to-earth possiblity continued into the first
session of the SAWSJ annual meeting which took place Saturday afternoon.
Reports from all the "activist" workshops laid out a series of practical
suggestions about how to further the alliance between SAWSJ and the labor
movement.  This first business session was also well attended - about 150
people.  There was a shared sense that SAWSJ needs to concentrate during
this next year on organizing local SAWSJ chapters and creating "activist
networks"  across chapters to mobilize around a broad range of issues:
sweatshops, workfare, campus labor, and so on. The afternoon ended with a
showing and discussion of two films: "Out at Work" - a documentary about
sexual identity and representation in the workplace; and "Degrees of
Shame" - a film about the plight of adjuncts in the university. SAUSAGES
then spent the night partying at a local club, entertained by the band
Bones of Contention together with guest poets and musicians.
        The final session on Sunday morning was devoted to adopting a
constitution and organizational structure for SAWSJ. After some discussion
and minor amendment, the draft constitution was approved: it is published
on the SAWSJ website at http://www.sage.edu/html/SAWSJ. A National
Coordinating Committee of 8 persons was elected, charged with operational
responsibility for SAWSJ in between meetings of a larger Steering
Committee, a body to be created over the next year. The members of the
Coordinating Committee are Dan Clawson, Michael Denning, Dorothy Fennell,
Steve Fraser, Adam Green, Jenny Lee, Margaret Levi, and Jamal Watson;
their email addresses are available on the SAWSJ website.

Report"  has produced an 58-minute program based on the teach-in which is
available for your local college, independent or NPR radio station. For
information about the May 18 downlink or for audio tape call Pacifica:
1-800-735-0230 X 266, Mark Torres, or see the notice on this website. It
is now available in RealAudio on the "Building Bridges"  website, which
can be reached from the SAWSJ website.
        While both the teach-in and the first annual meeting must be
accounted successes, the real future of SAWSJ depends entirely on the
energy and activity at the local level. We urge all of you to take the
intitiatve to inaugurate a SAWSJ chapter where you live or work or go to
school. We can help with advice and contacts and explain the rather simple
relationship between a local chapter and the national organization. But
the future of SAWSJ is in your hands.
                HELP BUILD THE NEW CULTURE OF SOLIDARITY!

IV. WBAI RADIO DOCUMENTARY ON THE SAWSJ CONFERENCE -- ON THE AIR, ON TAPE,
AND ON THE WEB

        WBAI Pacifica Radio's "BUILDING BRIDGES: Your Community and Labor
Report"  has produced a 58-minute radio show on the SAWSJ Labor Teach-in,
"Democracy and the Right to Organize."  The program is being broadcast in
the New York City area and around the country -- over 20 stations are
broadcasting it so far. BUILDING BRIDGES is produced by Mimi Rosenberg and
Ken Nash.
        BUILDING BRIDGES has also received a grant from the AFL-CIO to
subsidize 40 public and college radio stations to receive a copy of the
tape for broadcast and to uplink the show over the NPR satellite. The
Pacifica Network will make tapes available to radio stations through the
Pacifica Archives and will uplink the show to its affiliates through its
Ku band satellite uplink. There are thus several ways for college and
public radio stations to receive the program for broadcast. Contact your
college or public radio stations and lobby them to get the tape of the
conference and put it on their air.
        Individuals may also purchase the tape from the Pacifica Archives.
        WBAI has also put the SAWSJ documentary on its web site in
RealAudio.  The url for the documentary is:

        To assist: in reshaping the nation's political culture and
fostering the growth of a vibrant, progressive, multicultural
working-class movement; in shaping the terms of political debate and
contesting corporate dominance of politics and culture; in restoring the
mutually empowering relationship between the labor movement and its allies
in the academic and cultural communities, and reassessing their places in
a changing world.
                        Article III: MEMBERS

        Any person who agrees with the purposes outlined in Article II may

Section 3:
        Allocation of dues money If a member is recruited by a chapter,
the new member may request that 25 percent of the dues be allocated to the
chapter. If a member is recruited by a regional organization, the new
member may request that 25 percent of the dues be allocated to the region.
Members may designate money to both chapter and regional organizations, in
which case only 50 percent of their dues will be for the national

all members of the region.  Regions may take positions, issue statements
and endorsements in their own name, but not in the name of the national
organization.  Each region shall be entitled to elect two representatives
to the steering committee.  Regions may, by a majority vote of the
membership, decide on such regional officers and governance procedures as
they deem appropriate, subject to acceptance and certification by the
Steering Committee.

                        Article VII: ACTIVIST NETWORKS

        Activist networks shall consist of any group of 10 or more
members, united by an interest in an issue, who constitute themselves as
an activist network and plan or carry out a collective action or project.
Activist networks may take positions, issue statements and endorsements in
their own name, but not in the name of the regional or national
organization.  Each activist network shall be entitled to elect one
representative to the steering committee.

for one-year terms, in order to provide staggered terms thereafter.

Section 3: Meetings
        The Steering Committee shall meet at least once each
year, and may, by decision of the Steering Committee or the Coordinating
Committee, meet more frequently. Meetings of the Steering Committee shall

decides to go into executive session.

Section 4: Authority The Steering
        Committee shall have authority on all matters of policy,

full power to transact its business and to do and perform all things
necessary to be done in order to carry out the purposes of the
organization, subject only to the final authority of votes of the entire
membership at the annual meeting or by such other means as shall be
determined by the Steering Committee.

                        Article X: COORDINATING COMMITTEE

either of the National Co-Chairs, or by a petition signed by half the
members of the Coordinating Committee. To the extent reasonably possible,
meetings of the Coordinating Committee shall be announced in advance, and
all members of SAWSJ shall be able to attend and observe meetings, unless

necessary to be done in order to carry out the purposes of the
organization, subject to the authority of the Steering Committee and to
votes of the entire membership.

                        Article XI: NOMINATIONS

Section 1: Nominations Committee
        The Steering Committee shall elect a Nominations Committee to

        At least six weeks prior to elections, the Nominations Committee
shall prepare and circulate to the entire membership a list of candidates
for officers, coordinating committee members, steering committee members,
and such other positions as are open for election. The aim and intent
shall be to select two candidates for each position, in order to guarantee
contested elections.

Section 3: Open Nominations
        Any additional candidate may qualify for the ballot by submitting
a petition to the Nominations Committee, containing the names of 10 or
more members in good standing who support the person's candidacy. Such
petitions must be received at least two weeks prior to the elections,
unless this rule is waived by vote of the Steering Committee or by a vote
of the entire membership at the annual meeting.

                        Article XII: ELECTIONS

        All members in good standing are eligible to vote. Voting may be
conducted at the Annual Meeting, or by mail (including email) ballot. The
choice of election procedures shall be decided by a vote of the entire
membership or by a vote of the Steering Committee, if the membership votes
to designate this authority. If no candidate for an office receives 40
percent or more of the vote, a run-off election shall be held between
those candidates with the highest vote totals.

                        Article XIII: STAFF

        The Coordinating Committee may hire such staff as it deems
appropriate to conduct the operations of the organization.

                        Article XIV: ADVISORY BOARD

Since you asked I will say! Go to "Dick Search" (!) and type my last
name--my favorite things are of course my own fiction: "The New Slut
Feminism" and "The Resulting Claire".  There is also up some memoir and a
review I did of Lynne Tillman's work (Its named "Lit Squad Has A Fling")
& yes the Dodie B. article is great - I was happy to see it there.

As to your concerns/troubles with the site and its focus, I don't feel
totally comfortable responding in public as Lily, Susannah & Joshilyn
Jackson (who took over for Susannah in January) are dear to me.  Lily &
Joshilyn have fiction in Outlet 1 & 2...Lily has a book out from FC2 called
_The Great Taste of Straight People_, and it will be clear as (if) you read
Joshilyn's story in Outlet 2 (Outlet 2 also featuring Linda Russo!) that she
does have what might be considered 'more political? more Feminist?'
concerns, too.........Their use of humor is great, I think, and the intended
audience is........not this list?

I'm also impressed with Lily's critical cyberedge.  As for the tittygirl
illustrations, yes its strange, in the New Slut Fem, my narrator is chubby,
in the illustration, she's...........Cindy Crawford with glasses on?  But
shit, its up and illustrated, what can I say?  ANd Susannah's editing helped
bring out the story, too, which was written years ago originally.

So now I've admitted everything. and one mor ething-

This month I wrote an article for them featuring a condom at their request
as an attempt was being made to get a condom company to sponsor the
site---crass commercialism?
& maybe MARX (or at least the 'economy') comes (!)(excuse me) in here: I
know years ago this would have made me sick, but then years ago I thought
MFA programs were ridiculous, now I've attended one, and now I've written an
article to try for a sponsor....not my main goal, but an interesting
exercise (would you be pleased as an executive to read of a boy's 1st-sex
condom being found a month later under a Converse tenny, full of maggots?)

>those two extremes.  Am I referring to "man & wife"?  or Christian

Or the House of Dior and Ann Demuelsteer (SP!)?


Is the Waldrop quote from '78 or '88?

Todd thanks for the lovely poem(s)!

Kathy's Diary (last of 2)


In Kathy's diary/epistolary material, she also said that the idea of us
completely knowing each other stunned her; she thought there were a lot of
ways we were alike, and talked about our fantasies in relation to each
other. She said she didn't quite understand what was going on, and I re-
member feeling the same way myself.

She was working on a book at the time, this was when she was calling her-
self The Black Tarantula, publishing under the name. I was involved in her
thinking. Our thinking about each other was intertwined, inseparable. I
can't think of a gap; we filled each other's spaces. She wanted us to send
each other as much information as possible about each other, in varied
media, so that we could continue along these lines. She mentioned Vito
Acconci, saying the kind of intimacy he explores in his work, she had
never seen done between two people who were both subjects and objects. She
thought all of this would make an incredible work as well. I thought and
still think that Vito's exploration wasn't all that risky, but articulated
so as to appear so, without props; the props in fact provided the frame-
work, moving the periphery towards the center. But that wasn't clear until
much later.

She thought I was more systematic in my exploration than she was; is that
true? Certainly I pick up and drop systems like water, like there's link-
ages surrounding the gasp of the earth's equator - but then these same
systems become corroded by desire, tend to fray/stare at one from the
edges where I reside. I was residing there at the time. A bit later we
were making tapes together, worlds falling apart, and as the content of
one of the tapes indicated, I was reading Norman O. Brown's Love's Body at
the time. I just found the book again.

Kathy thought my work could profit from the intimate sexual concerns of
hers - perhaps it has. Certainly the tape we did was the farthest I've
been able to stretch my body, on the operating-table so to speak, of both
semiosis and psychosis. I could but won't speak towards her state of mind
at the time, from what she said. But this was later. Now, she was writing
to me before that, asking whether I would collaborate with her, speaking
of her fanaticism in relation to what she was doing - I certainly shared
(and share) that aspect of her psychology.

Now I'm intertwined with this text, which on my part within it, still re-
flects concerns I've never figured out, in the sense of a figure or trope,
those moments which become signs or ghosts in the very background of our
being. They remain there just as these letters and diary have accompanied
me; would that they were published, but who is to say concerning the
Estate, and to what extent would I want to give up the paraphrase for the
real?

And am I living through text, and if so, whose?

Hi all again,

   This is the most I've ever posted to the list.  I don't know that this
matters to anyone else, but I got the folks at www.poems.com to post my full
poem (instead of just the second half) starting Monday.  So if anyone would
like to see the whole thing, it'll be there under Saturday's poem.

For Maria et al belated,

In April Harry Mathews was at DU Denver. He said Oulipo is wildly
popular these days, attracting crowds in the hundreds to their readings.
And by the way, since the question was asked, about women, a question
that was on my mind as Harry was discussing the strict application of
rules and limitation.  I asked Harry if he thought the method appealed
to men more than women.  He scowled and asked me if I ever watched a
game of hopscotch.

I never was any good at hopscotch, or jacks, for that matter.

From one who thinks rules are at their best when they are judiciously
broken.

(p.s.--I'll be off for a week or two on the road back home to B'lyn--A.
Hollo, L. Wright, P. Pritchett, M. DuCharme, D. Rogerson-- I'll miss you
terribly)

        Poetry, don't you start telling me about poetry. I know all about
poetry, thank you very much [he said with a sort of bull-snort].
        But let me tell you this.
        There's no obligation to accept society or women or religion or
        anything else, not for anyone there isn't.
        As for poetry, that's a job for anarchs.
        Poetry's made by rebels and exiles and outsiders, it's made by
        people on their own, not sheep baaaing bravo to any Pope.
        Poets don't need religion and they don't need bloody little
        cocktail-party gossip either; it's they who make language and
        make myths. Poets don't need anybody except themselves.
        [Undisclosed source]
        let me add to list of things Poets don't need:
        theories, and any form of dogma of the left or right.

        The great poet Tristan Tzara was a leftist all his life.

        But he never kissed the ass of any Stalinist. In fact,
                there was fist fight at his funeral. Between some
        lettrists and some dogmatic Stalinists. And  I am not running down
Stalin, and I am not running down the Pope, any more than I would run down

        the Dalai lama. All these contemporary leftists type autmatically
assume that being Christian, patriarchal  makes one an idiot. Well
friends, Paul Virilio is a christian, and so was Grahame Greene. One does
not have to accept any or not even some of the premises of any movement to
be a good, great or special poet. IT is all very individual. L.F. Celine
was a pretty bad politican in my books, but he was a great novelist.

        PD James portrays a type of man and poet which you seem to think

        is mediocre. Oh well. What is mediocre? Anything which disagrees

        with a leftist politics. Balderdash is what we say. Politics like
poetry should be a porocess of constraint and movement. Not dogma and not
a dogma riddled with some blather based on a fickle and badly digested
Lacan-ism. That is not a typo. Ism  the ism of justifications.

        Pah! I have sung 'theory' in three countries.

        And the hexagram says: Let It Go.


        last but not least if you going to attack orpheus then do so
properly. In Lacanian 'thought and doctrine' the penis as you so prudently
refer to the male cock is not the Phallus. You can go read that. And see.
Not that I am especially interested in that sort of pyscho-analytic
gibberish But you shld. know the difference. BEcause I am no fan of Lacan.
I prefer
Duns Scotus, James Joyce, Milton, HD, Plath, Everson, and hosts of others.

        Adam Dalgliesh is something you cannot understand. Because
        you imagine that poetry is associated with virtue. I mean
        a circle of virtue which you associate with the left I suppose.
        Dalgliesh is just part of the English poet image as establishment
        figure. But if your politics are so paranoid that you cannot
        imagine beyond that, well then you beyond reprieve. After all, so
        many great poets are of the right and conservative. In fact
        it seems that all the American poets who everyone now declares
        great, were men whose politics was either informed by a Christian
        view point, and or men whose politics was conservative at one
level or another.




        Long Live the fictional Adam Dalgliesh.


        I love the sound of Dalgliesh.



        One thinks of Hopkins, and Donne and Shakespeare.


                As close to the establishment of their times

        as a man can get and still sing and bring home the bacon.

Right now I am in the middle of reading Inagaki Taruho's "One Thousand and
One-Second Stories" published by Sun & Moon.  My wife (who is Japanese)
have been raving about this writer for some time to me.  This Japanese
writer is a combination of fairy tale meets sophisticated urban life meets
slapstick.  Most of these stories I believe were written in the Thirties
and Twenties.

If you are familar with Edogawa Rampo, Taruho is a 'lighter' version of
Rampo's dark sexuality and horror.  And I wanted to mention this title
because one - our friend Douglas published it, and two the images are
hauntingly (is there such a word) poetic in its language and imagery.

ciao,
Tosh

I do get to second this as well; it's a wonderful book straight out of
Meiji era I think although much later than that, owes to Melies as well,
lots of Mr. Moon falling just about everywhere! And I don't even have
_any_ friend named Douglas!

I saw this movie yesterday and am still thinking about it
somewhat confusedly. Very powerful, a work of cinematic genius in the
battle scenes, no question, but disturbing, it seems to me, in its
broader, potential impact on the culture (i.e. Will it help make U.S.
police actions against "non-democratic" states more attractive to the
public? Will it help set the stage for patriotic rally around our
soldiers who are willing to put up with, and rise to--like the
heroic, play-calling, and Emerson quoting quarterback Captain
Miller--so much visceral violence? ). I'm not sure here... The
treatment of the American soldiers (though not the Germans--they are
pretty much all bad guys and, suggestively, through the temporarily
captured one, plain despicable) is quite moving, and one senses what
the U.S.veterans of WWII, Korea, and Vietnam must feel about not
being fully understood in regards to the horrors they endured.
Wondering what people think about this movie? Or are _all_ the
critics right that it's a wonderful movie through and through? Is
this the best treatment we can get of the "good war"?

And actually, if I may ask,what do people on this List think? Was it
a "good war"?

   Dave Baratier asks what "cross-gendered identification" is.
   I guess I just meant the term simply (if loosely) to mean
   when someone of one gender and/or sex adopts or takes on
   the voice of someone of another gender and/or sex....
   I didn't say that YAU was NEW for doing that....
   but then "make it new" has never been much of a standard for me
   (see Mike Magee's intro to his mag COMBO for a view I largely share)

   Karen Kelley. COuld you tell me which particular piece of Yau's was
   in First Intensity? My hunch is you're talking about a piece called
   BUTCHER, BAKER, or CANDLESTICK MAKER, but I'd like to know more
   specifically before I respond....Because I'm curious about what
   you mean by "stereotypical" and why you think the piece you read is
   so.....
   Thanks, chris stroffolino

I haven't actually seen the movie, but I've heard that there are no
African American or Chicano soldiers shown in any of the larger battle
scenes. Strange since Spielberg claimed to try and make this movie as
close to reality as possible and quite a large number of the soldiers that
fought in WWII were African American and Chicano or Latino.

Kent, I havent seen this movie yet, & may never. (I have spent much time

among earliest memories being _The Great War Illustrated_ , which I
discovered in a closet under the stairs where we took refuge (?) during a

admitedly, i haven't seen the movie (and probably won't) but i loved what
the guy on NPR (sorry, can't remember his name) said: that the problem w/
the movie was that we could still see "little stevie spielberg" behind the
curtin, pulling all the levers.

will the movie "do any good"?  well, here's a bit of dialogue from the pen
of kurt vonnegut, many years ago:
        "Is it an anti-war book?"
        "Yes," I said, "I guess."
        "You know what I say to people when I hear they're writing an
                anti-war book?"
        "No.  What _do_ you say, Harrison Starr?"
        "I say, 'Why don;t you write an anti-_glacier_ book instead?"

i was thinking about this "will it do any good" question just this
weekend, actually.  i saw a clip of an interview w/ spielberg saying that
he wanted everyone to understand "the horrors of war" and then,
chanel-surfing, i happened upon the defense dep't (remember when it was
the war dep't?) press conference about the CNN/Time story about using
agent orange on AWOL soldiers in laos.  one of the def. dep't guys said
that "according to the records" one of the former soldiers who said he was
in laos never was there--and i thought to myself, "jesus christ!
'according to records'?! who is this guy kidding?! if it was a secret
mission, would there be any records?! i mean, hasn't this guy even seen
_apocalypse now_?!"

will it do any good?  did _the best years of our lives_?  did _coming
home_? did the poetry of sigfried sassoon?  did _catch-22_ or _going after
cacciato_?

Someone reads that stuff & is changed by it ... maybe not the
culture-as-a-whole ... but "some people" ... _Catch-22_ adds to the dialogue
... so we have something, there, to put eye to & finger on ... other than say
"yellow ribbon = support the troops" ... or "loose lips sink ships" ... we
have, for instance, Slaughterhouse 5 ... which I read when very young ... & it
did make a difference ... so did Deer Hunter ...  opposition needs to be
articulated ... in whatever medium ... otherwise?

In the segregated army of WW II black soldiers served in separate units,
none of which, as I remember, saw action on D-Day, although they were
active elswehere in the European theater.

I worked on a reply, discarded it; and can only say that I agree with
David, although there are no good wars.

I have difficulties with "good" and "bad" as well, not believing in any
transcendent metaphoricity that would garner such divisions; which places
me in the camp of Tertullian I suppose. And I would have gone as well.

I agree with Alan, about no good war, though violence simply is.
Hendrik Hertzberg wrote a pretty comprehensive piece on the movie in
this week's New Yorker.  He seems to feel the two 25 minute real life
depictions of combat made the movie important, though not great, all by
themselves.  Posing the question of the value of realism. I remain
skeptical.

Interesting that 25 minutes should seem "long" for a war scene.  It's a
result of the time-compression brought to us in part by movies
themselves.  A 25 minute sex scene would likely be labelled pornographic
no matter how it was shot.

Speaking of which: I'm listening to a pop station while writing this and
just heard a (male) DJ give away tickets to a (female) listener; they
banter back and forth, agreeing that the movie will inevitably be great
because Matt Damon is so "hot."

No good wars, agreed; I would probably have gone; but can any of us
seriously imagine the U.S. faced with a situation that morally
unambiguous?  (Not the U.S. itself necessarily, but the enemy faced).

Saw the movie with my 2 sons (twins, age13) the other day shortly after
viewing a documentary about VietNam war widows that my cousin ismaking for
NPR (she herself is one).  Found both to be horrific and convincing as did
my boys, future war fodder.  The personal stories and visits to Viet Nam
sites in my cousin's piece moved them as did the Spielberg movie's
"realistic" violence and carnage.  I was pleased by their thoughtful
response and can't imagine how "Saving. . ." could make anyone gungho to
go fight the next big one.

But more seriously, re Rachel (soon to be sorely missed in Boulder)
Levitsky's post on Oulipo and so on, in which she said:And by the way, since
the question was asked, about women, a question
that was on my mind as Harry was discussing the strict application of
rules and limitation.  I asked Harry if he thought the method appealed
to men more than women.  He scowled and asked me if I ever watched a
game of hopscotch.

I never was any good at hopscotch, or jacks, for that matter.

Does anyone else gag when they read this? Why is it still acceptable to
dismiss rather than addressing (or even refusing to address but owning up to
it) questions if they relate to a gender or race or sexual orientation or
etc. other than one's own? I'll take forthright bigotry over this sort of
snideness any day.

With curry all over my keyboard,

but isn't the film more war-IS-horrible-but-by-god-someone's-got-to-do-it?
someone's got to fight the Evil Forces.
someone's got to be brave but there are no heroes here.
there are no heroes here because we're just doing our duty.
we're just doing our duty, and it is a bitter pill, and that is heroic,
altho we're reluctant to accept such labels, because our boys suffer...

"morally unambiguous"--what does that mean?

or Dalton Trumbo's Johnnie Got His Gun or Nathaniel West's Dream Life of
Balso Snell, or Kenneth Patchen's Sleepers Awake, but they only make
pacificists one at a time, not like tanks rolling off the chrysler line,
and by the way nobody's talking about one of the real reasons the japanese
economy is faltering, for fifty years they were forbidden to spend on
military but that's all changed in the past decade, they're working hard to
make the arms dealers (like Harrod's owned by Diana's boyfriend's Dad)
wealthier still and defence spending is a dead loss what i've heard is if
you took the money in the defence budget and just threw it in the street
more jobs would be created than spent as it is.

And as we left the film and drove home, my boys were grappling with the
difficulty of just that:
"You're Jewish, right, Mom?" (showing what little religious training
they've had).  "So if Germany had won World War Two, you might not have
been born?"

Then to father, who isn't Jewish but was conscientious objector in Viet
Nam era, the question, "Would you have gone to WW2?"

So complex thoughts are being engendered by the experience, no matter what
Spielberg or official culture wishes.

Hi Chris,

Good call: it IS "Butcher, Baker..."

"I'm a dancer who makes men spin in their graves, gets them to yell 'bay bee,'
whisper 'gosh' and 'honey,' and dream of 'whoopee.'"

"Fate got warm with me, dealt me a flush. So I'm packaged right for the job. I have
an easygoing, cornstalk smile; I'm tall and tilted just enough so short guys don't
have to crane their little necks and hurt themselves. I can crouch and rise smooth as
a wave. Twist and twirl until their brains turn to jellyfish bobbing in a beer
bottle."

"Early on I learned that men like to be swatted a little if you do it right and put
on your girl-next-door smile while shaking your assets just beyond reach. I had tits
and a smile that gave men cramps."

This seems *extraordinarily* off-base as a representation of what a woman might think
when contemplating male reaction to her body. Admittedly I am *one* woman among many.
But I wonder if perhaps Yau isn't closer to what *men* *think* women think.

When I first read the piece I felt guilty about finding it an amusing read when it
was so clearly a man's idea of a woman's feelings. And as someone who's held the same
job as the narrator, I'm aware of how routinely dancers are stereotyped.

It sounds like you felt differently about the piece, Chris. C'mon, spill it.

Karen

        Well, now, there, Orpheus, you're off to a fine start with your
"Poetry, don't you start telling me about poetry. I know all about poetry,
thank you very much." There's an end to discussion right there. No
principle of exchange informs your procedures? You will be telling _us_
about poetry. And after all, we don't know all about poetry yet. Well,
then, Yessir!

Permit me (or don't permit me) to take issue with certain of your
pronouncements (or Papal bulls---).

"There's no obligation to accept society." I would say that you already are
enjoying this obligation. I'm sure you use money, and that the electric
company introduces power to your home, that when you turn the tap, potable
water flows.Some arm of society probably taught you to read and spell. And
we know for a fact that you are on a Poetics List on the Internet.

"There's no obligation to accept women." Well, it all depends what you mean
by "accept." At one level, you have to accept their existence and the
exclusive function of childbirth, unless you were not of woman born.

"Poets don't need religion...[nor]...theories, and any form of dogma of the
left or right." Yet later, you remark that all the American poets now
considered great, were men whose politics were either informed by Christian
viewpoint, or...whose politics were conservative. Can you clear up this
apparent contradiction in your thought?

[Btw, Emily Dickinson? Not a man.]

You are correct in identifying my thinking with Lacan's, although I reject
your assertion that my thinking is "a fickle and badly digested Lacan-ism."
In fact, when you write "the penis is not the Phallus" it is your Lacan
that sounds poorly digested, for although you know that "penis" and
"phallus" are not synonymous in his terminology, it did not occur to you
that they sometimes overlap, and that my aside indicated one of these
times. After all, the penis is a source of the trouble we were discussing,
and the phallus is a term for that trouble. It is simply too simple to make
the sweeping statement you were anxious to make.

I think you might enjoy reading Lacan at greater length. His is a poetic
sensibility; he was a rebel; he was a man.


But I am a poet and I would agree with you that as creators we need humble
ourselves before noone. When in 1966 I wrote the poem "A Final Mission"
(_The Ends of the Earth_, Black Sparrow, L.A., 1968), in which a B-52
transforms into a penis that then transforms into a naked woman, I had not
read Lacan, although I had of course read Freud, and, beyond that, I had
experience and the feelings it brings with it.  When, a decade later, I
_did_ begin to read Lacan, I was drawn on by my recognition of, if not a
like-mindedness, then of a shared interest, and a sense that I might find
articulated in ways beyond my abilities, insights I'd had.

I thought, you know, I might learn something. Even though I am a poet.

As to a damn' Dogleash : I had the chance to do further research just last
night, before I fell asleep. I admire the pretty lawns and the well-kept-up
cottages, and the alluring rivers and wave-swept beaches (where would
England be today without its tourist industry?) where the corpses keep
popping up. Dogleash looks like a wimp to me (whereas, despite his
"culture," Morse doesn't) but that's dismissibly subjective. The bigger
picture is that in a time of universal police-inspired repression, I balk
at making a hero out of even the most sensitive and perspicacious of
fictional cops. And that is political, no two ways about it. But I am
entertained by the landscape, the lightning, the editing, the sets, the
high-priced cars, the make-up and costumes, the simulation of emotions, the
memorized dialogs, the shell-game plot, the simple notion that beneath
respectable exteriors may lurk evil, a family of ferocious moles beneath
one of those lovely lawns... Btw, what's the signification of the increase
in corpse dissection in the police labs in all these English tec shows? Is
that what market research shows the Brits want? And the rest of the viewing
world?

I spent three years as a full-time antinuclear activist (and lifelong
red diaper baby peace creep etc. etc.), so please don't misunderstand my
intentions here.  But in a fabulous bit of irony, the internet on which
you're reading these words began, and probably could only have begun, as
a DARPA (Defense Advanced Research Program Agency) project.  And writing
from the heart of the Silicon Valley, as I do, it's clear that the
internet is creating most of the "best" jobs.  Which is not to say that
such a chain of events is anything more than random, or that most
defense spending is productive.  It isn't.

Would that the question were simpler and less vexed--

Re: Saving Private Ryan, which I haven't seen and don't intend to see,
having found SCHINDLER'S LIST quite phoney and manipulative:

Kent, if you want to see what WWII "felt like," look at some of the
superb documentaries often shown on the History Channel.  That was the
real thing.  Spielberg's simulations, as a letter to the editor in the
LA Times pointed out today, are on the following order:  in one battle
scene the officers were helmets with insignias that, acc. to this letter
writer who fought in the war, no officer ever would wear in battle
because it showed up too much.  A small detail but typical.  I
personally think the simulation of violent battle scenes is voyeuristic
and also false.  It does NOT tell you what war felt like.  My husband
Joe who was actually in WWII (tail end, missed the battles) in the
Pacific Theatre will tell you how disappointed the 18-year olds like
himself were to miss the battles because the felt they weren't being
brave and heroic enough.  Frank O'Hara, in the Pacific theatre at about
the same time, writes the same thing in letters to his family.  It may
have been crazy, but there it is.

As for the "good war" question, as someone who wouldn't be here today if
the British and US had not fought, I find the question really creepy.
Would you have liked to live under the Nazis?  Not a hypothetical
question for the British in 1939.  Nothing like a lot of people who have
never had to fight or indeed do anything on that order to sit around and
discuss whether or not they would have gone, and yes, as we all know all
wars are evil!  IWhat else is new?  It shows that it's time for a few
history lessons for the kids.

and, by the way, as endless letters in LA have been saying to Spielberg,
who said there were no great war movies??  There have been dozens with
amazing battle scenes but perhaps the greatest ever is the Bridge on the
River Kwai.  Not exactly a "recruiting" picture --it's very anti-war
--but deals with real issues not, "Oh boy, war is hell."  Isn't there
something wrong with sitting comfortably in a theatre, warm enough,
well-fed enough, eating popcorn and watching "War is hell" films?

Well--I'm sure I'm in the minority here but I had to sound off a bit....

Marjorie,

These young people today . . .

Seriously, though, I think we're seeing different things here.  The
question of "would I have gone" is not I think mainly directed at the
actual past but at our imagined future.  True, I haven't suffered or done
anything "of that order," but why is the _question_ creepy?  The answer
may be.

You and I may actually converge on a question of "national feeling." I
read Richard Rorty's _Achieving Our Country_ a few weeks ago and haven't
been the same since.

Cheers,
David

Marjorie Perloff:

I haven't seen the film either, and don't intend to for similar reasons that
you state. Actually, I haven't seen SCHINDLER'S LIST either; something about
Spielberg's films make me feel really angry. (Except JAWS, which was
relaxing and enjoyable.)

Perhaps I'm misreading your tone below but I think talking about "whether
one would go" during peacetime is quite important. After all, if one wants
to conscientiously object out of the military, you've got to do a lot of
groundwork before the war comes. It's not just important, it's imperative.

The history lessons for many kids I knew were completely inadequate to
stimulate such discussions. I'm talking about classroom lessons. Movies,
however, provoked talk; however basic they might have been, the questions
came up. The films were THE DEER HUNTER, FULL METAL JACKET (viewed one
summer over 60 times with friends, we still have it largely memorized), BIG
WEDNESDAY (believe it or not), and PLATOON. Generally, a lot of guys felt
(feel) the gov't/military is a fucked lot of liars and dickheads but
nevertheless they would go to war if called. (This was before the ROTC guys
who were trying to pay for college found themselves in Saudi Arabia, "making
the world safe for democracy.") One guy in particular I remember phrased it
as "going to bat for you country." He was against senseless war (Korea,
VietNam, the Gulf, assorted invasions of Latin American countries) but
by-god you've got to "go to bat for you country." His expression as he said
it still pains me. (Some kind of vague devotion to... something.)

So sit around. Talk about it. Watch war-is-hell films. Read THE ENORMOUS
ROOM, ARMIES OF THE NIGHT, "Route," FROM HERE TO ETERNITY (you can watch
this too). Find the documentaries that show how we began a systematic
destruction of Iraqi society (and continue to do it).

Better to talk of these things over popcorn in the air-conditioned theater,
than in the bunker thru your gas mas---I'm guessing anyway; rather not have
to go both roads.

i agreed with Laura, that the response about hopscotch seemed deliberately
evaisive and even meaningless...

Quite frankly, as the person who brought the gender-in-Oulipo question up:
i stick by what i felt to start with, that they have retained a strong
bias characteristic of the time and place in which the workshop was
founded: that most serious intellectuals most of the time, are going to be
men.  (or, put more simply, that women aren't really human, though of
course few individuals would be able to admit that that is a core
implication of their thoughts...)

Subject:      Re: Saving Private Ryan

I'm just a young one who was hardly alive when
the Falklands were going on; having never really
been around during a serious war that my own
country was involved with, I find a lot of the
"war movies" (including more "gritty" ones such
as Kubrick's) somewhat disturbing. Knowing how
much the media distorts, say, the underground
environmental movements such as Earth First!,
which I'm familiar with, it's hard to take their
fare in even more important aspects of an education.
_The Killing Fields_, for example, is a pretty
good movie, but rather confused; as an emotional
work, it's excellent, but in the way it blurs the
actual events around, I think it fails in it's
duty somehow; I remember having to explain to
everyone in the rooom what was going on, who Pol
Pot was, why everyone getting shot was wearing
glasses -- even, at one point, why the Cambodians
spoke French.

                I realize that this is part of
the viewer's problem, but it seems that, if the
movie can have its effect without the audience
needing to know what's going on, they might as
well have made a movie about the Crusades and
left it at that.

So what's left, if you exclude the motion picture?
For me, I've always found the craters in the side
of the V&A in London the most eloquent "rememberance"
of the Blitz; for those who haven't been there,
imagine the NY Metropolitan Museum of Art with chunks
of stone missing from the side. In the same way,
physically being present in a concentration camp
is a fundamentally different experience from watching
the Spielberg recreation. There's something about
physical presence -- or, at least, a representation
of physical presence without a narrator -- that
overwhelms the senses more than a report, or a
film. Perhaps this is a historical approach similar
to the Quaker "bearing witness"; it's not enough to
be aware second hand.

That's not to say that fiction or poetry or filmmaking
has no place in war or tragedy; far from it -- Doris
Lessing, for example, has, to my mind, a brilliant
depiction of just-post-war London in the Four Gated
City. But when you deal with these events as a political
being, as a "citizen", it seems as if a different
approach is needed.

MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII

The observation that the internet emerged and in some sense could only
have emerged out of the military machine, is accurate.  By and large (as
lots of you know) the research that allowed the creation of functional
computers with vacuum tubes was almost entriely pentagon-driven.  (During
ol' wwii that we've been discussing, much of the idea was to be able to
calculate long-range targeting of large cannons; almost immediately
thereafter, of course, it became coordination of the US nuclear war
machine.)

The shape of our lived world, is strongly determined by the reality of
war.  **No war** undertaken by the US machine can be better than
problematic.  Because of the huge weight of US coercion toward its 80
percent working population, we who seldom vote and have no money, and
toward most of the world, on behalf of its capitalist elite, it is very,
very unlikely that any war launched by the US machine would be
supportable, right now. (Think of Grenada, Panama, even apart from murders
of civilians in those incursions that are public record, but denied and
buried by the state-subservient US media; the "turkey-shoot"...)
Sociopolitical circ's change, and it is hard for me to imagine opposing a
war against the fascist powers, yet it led to the two nuclear bombings,
not to mention Dresden and other ariel murder-bombings;  how can a
thinking person, with any values at all, support that scale of murder of
civilians?

For me, the best response in any medium to the way war has been accepted
and integrated into an undemocratic century, is in the work of Susan Howe,
especially in The Europe of Trusts (tho' elsewhere too).  It is hard to
convey how urgently her poetry grapples with the way gender and political
weights determine violence, and direct it toward those who have not gained
a measure of protection by becoming implicated in a violence of their own
(or who have not had any chance to do so).  One of the problems with
gazing at history's violations and oppressions is, that they are too large
and also tangled, to easily discuss; Howe brings the ability of words to
*frame silence* into play, and thus through sounds and visual text images
actually brings the wounded violence from history onto the page...

I wrote last night's message at white heat, mispelled "wear" (put
"were") and so on so let me add a little p.s.

The question "Is there such a thing as a good war?"  is a non-question.
The real issue would be:
Since we all know that war is hell for those who fight it, one must ask
1) what led up to War X?
2) could it have been avoided?  (in this case, as Churchill shows so
beautifully in THE GATHERING STORM) it probably could have been avoided
f the West had armed and not let Hitler get away with his actions
beginning in 1933.
3) Once war IS declared, can one turn one's back on those who are
fighting, in essence, for your ability to continue living and say you
won't participate?

Refusing to fight in the case of the Vietnam War was one thing; in the
case of WWII it was quite another.  There really wasn't much choice
since the victory of the Germans was a very real possibility.

I've just been reading (for a conference at Yale in the fall) Eugene
Jolas's autobiography, about to be published.  Jolas (the editor of
transition, Joyce's great friend, poet, etc) was Alsatian, tri-lingual,
describes movingly how his brother got into a fight right on the border
with a Nazi as early as 1933 and was jailed for 2 years by the Nazis and
tortured just for that.  He describes how the whole literary and
intellectual community felt when France fell and the Nazis marched into
Paris.  At a moment like that, you don't sit around and say, "Isn't war
hell"  and "is this a good war?"  You just defend your friends as
Beckett did by doing whatever you can.

Therefore I am wholly unimpressed with Spielberg's latest Star Wars
venture--cops and robbers yet again.  I don't care how "authentic" it
is; it's a simulation meant to do--exactly what?  Make people wonder if
it was worthwhile?  Make money?  Whatever the motives, they're not very
good ones and they totally distort what really went on in WWII.

Incidentally, the best movie on this question (not battle scenes but
otherwise) aside from "River Kwai" is surely Ophuls' THE SORROW AND THE
PITY.  Splices actual war footage and occupation footage with interviews
with the survivors, of all political stamps.  It's hair-raising.

Basta!

When Sam Fuller's WWII film _The Big Red One_ came out in the early 80's, he
was asked the usual questions about the verisimilitude of war films and
responded by saying that the ony way to give an audience any idea of "what
it was like" would be to have rifllemen shoot into the audience.

As far as great battle scenes go, it's hard to imagine anyone improving on
Welles's Battle of Shrewsbury in _Chimes at Midnight_, or Kurosawa's
storming of the Third Castle in _Ran_. The best war film I've ever seen, bar
none, and one that I'm not ashamed to say makes me weep unabashedly, is Kon
Ichikawa's _Harp of Burma_, also a WWII film, also "anti-war," and yet, so
much more, of course. (Also on WWII by Ichikawa and worth seeing: _Fires on
the Plain_).

I look forward to the Spielberg, nevertheless. He's far too important a

Re: Saving Private Ryan, which I haven't seen and don't intend to see,
having found SCHINDLER'S LIST quite phoney and manipulative:

Kent, if you want to see what WWII "felt like," look at some of the
superb documentaries often shown on the History Channel.  That was the
real thing.  Spielberg's simulations, as a letter to the editor in the
LA Times pointed out today, are on the following order:  in one battle
scene the officers were helmets with insignias that, acc. to this letter
writer who fought in the war, no officer ever would wear in battle
because it showed up too much.  A small detail but typical.  I
personally think the simulation of violent battle scenes is voyeuristic
and also false.  It does NOT tell you what war felt like.  My husband
Joe who was actually in WWII (tail end, missed the battles) in the
Pacific Theatre will tell you how disappointed the 18-year olds like
himself were to miss the battles because the felt they weren't being
brave and heroic enough.  Frank O'Hara, in the Pacific theatre at about
the same time, writes the same thing in letters to his family.  It may
have been crazy, but there it is.

As for the "good war" question, as someone who wouldn't be here today if
the British and US had not fought, I find the question really creepy.
Would you have liked to live under the Nazis?  Not a hypothetical
question for the British in 1939.  Nothing like a lot of people who have
never had to fight or indeed do anything on that order to sit around and
discuss whether or not they would have gone, and yes, as we all know all
wars are evil!  IWhat else is new?  It shows that it's time for a few
history lessons for the kids.

and, by the way, as endless letters in LA have been saying to Spielberg,
who said there were no great war movies??  There have been dozens with
amazing battle scenes but perhaps the greatest ever is the Bridge on the
River Kwai.  Not exactly a "recruiting" picture --it's very anti-war
 --but deals with real issues not, "Oh boy, war is hell."  Isn't there
something wrong with sitting comfortably in a theatre, warm enough,
well-fed enough, eating popcorn and watching "War is hell" films?

Well--I'm sure I'm in the minority here but I had to sound off a bit....

Mark,

despite it's being hard, can you give some specific examples? I'm most
interested in where you say "Howe brings the ability of words to
*frame silence* into play, and thus through sounds and visual text images
actually brings the wounded violence from history onto the page..."

Perhaps one luminous example of sounds and visual text images actually
bringing the wounded violence from history onto the page.

I heard Tom Shales' review of _Saving Private Ryan_ on NPR, in which he
concluded -- with the kind of original, stunning insight that earned him a
Pulitzer -- that ultimately the film was no more  than a bunch of actors
playing with toy guns. So I guess the only way to make a truly convincing
war movie -- which seems to be what everyone wants -- is to give the
audience a 50/50 chance of getting out of the theater alive. Where is
William Castle when we need him? As those of us old enough to remember "The
Tingler" can attest, he wouldn't have been afraid to mine a few seats.

But seriously, movies like "Ryan" and "Schindler's List" are inevitable
victims of their own overblown marketing apparatus. Would those who found
the latter to be slick and exploitive have felt the same way if they
stumbled across it -- unheralded, unanticipated -- in some Village art
house, as though it were an independent film about which one had few or no
expectations? What if the director had been Hal Hartley or John Sayles?
What if Steve Buscemi played Schindler? The marketplace has generally made
it impossible to approach Hollywood product without prior knowledge or
assumptions. Maybe this is a good thing, since yes we are less likely to be
manipulated if we already know how many stars, thumbs, whatever, a film has
collected on its way through the media's meta-gauntlet. But it also results
in weird reverse-experiences. Example: I was bored to sleep by "Wag the
Dog," which I'd already been advised by everyone from Dan Schorr to Saddam
Hussein was a great film, but absolutely loved "Wild Things" -- about which
I'd known nothing beforehand, and only later discovered was a cheap, crass,
artless pseudo-noir. It was also great, quirky fun. I'll see "Private Ryan"
all right, but in about 3 or 4 years when I've forgotten what everyone
tells me what I should think of it.

Just want to point out, re: Wizards book and other early sources I have
here inc. some original papers, although the Net emerged out of the mil-
itary, it very quickly developed a superstructure guided by computer
scientists not particularly interested in such - news and telnet and email
and a host of other directions developed in the first 3 years for example
including the online eliza game, etc. It's to easy to jump into the mili-

Just out of curiosity, since you won't go see the film - and yet you blast

Thanks to Linda R. for mentioning my piece at Postfeminist
Playground--particularly since I didn't know it was there!  They wrote to
me ages ago about posting it, and it was a busy period in my life and I
kind of lost the message in the piles of e-mail that rush in, and then when
I got one of those "Live Dangerously?" messages from Eudora and was
cleaning out my mailboxes, I found it and wrote back to them eons later
that they could use it.  They never wrote back, so I assumed that my
flakiness killed the idea.

I like the site, and I like being published in non-avant-garde/poetry environs.

The piece is also in the new/long-overdue Poetics Journal--it was a talk I
gave at New Langton Arts years ago--for an evening on Eros and Writing
(curated by Kevin K.), and it was purposely written for a non-intellectual
audience.  When, after the talk Barrett asked if they could use it for PJ,
I was surprised, since the piece is so determininately non-high-fallutin'.
Barrett was still living here in SF and David Wojnarowitz was still
alive--that long ago.  The only reason I said it was okay to post it at
Postfeminist Playground was because I assumed there would never be a
cross-over between its audience and the PJ audience, so it's a bit
disconcerting to have seen it mentioned here.  I guess this goes to show,
you never know . . .

I will go see "Saving PR" as phony as it may be -- just as I saw
Spielberg's list.  The public discussion is crucial -- athough I'm afraid
the end result will be to further undo the "Vietnam syndrome" and not etch
more deeply the horrors of war.

I haven't stopped fighting WW2, and I wasn't even born yet.

I haven't stopped fighting against the Vietnam War either -- and I'm not
entirely sure that one has ended either.

The wars don't end -- they just pause.  The problem has been trying to
escape the war mentality as much as the bloodshed.

Better flawed art -- and I do believe Spielberg keeps trying -- than none.
There have been excellent war movies: The Power and the Glory, Platoon.
Full-Metla Jacket, MASH.

Here's a suggestion for the high-roller producers on this list for
movies not yet made: how about a movie about the torment of pacificsts
during WW2; how about a movie that genuinely depicts the chaos, rage,
fear, and battle of anti-war organizers during Vietnam.  Has any movie
depicted the anti-War movement accurately?  I rage about the depiction of
the movement in Forest Gump, for example.

Alan,

You're right about the interests of the computer scientists who
developed the net.  But who gave them the money?  The principal funding
source behind the Stanford AI Lab, MIT AI Lab, SRI, CMU etc. was DARPA.
Money coming from other sources, like the National Science Foundation,
was much less significant.  The odd collection of graduate students,
researchers, hackers and hangers-on who worked on programs such as
Eliza, Emacs, telnet, email, etc. were, for the most part, directly or
indirectly supported by DARPA money--they may not have been paid by that
agency (though many were, including many who did not agree with military
goals), but they used facilities and machines purchased with DARPA
funds.  So while we might want to sanitize that history, the truth is
that net pioneers took the money and ran.

"sanitize"? Hardly. "ran"? as if they were getting away with something?
That's not how the history went down.

As far as the source of the money goes, yes, and there were additional
funds from universities, etc. But that hardly made it a military enter-

Alan, I admire you (as I think you know) and don't really want to be in
a pitched battle here.  But yes--exactly as if they were getting away
with something.  My husband was at the Stanford AI Lab and that is how
the history "went down."  Money for research had to be procured from
funding agencies, each of which had its own agenda.  A successful grant
proposal appeared to address this agenda in some way, even while the
applicant's interests might be elsewhere.

Re: "additional funds from universities," Stanford (for example) was
heavily dependent on federal research money, and in fact made a killing
charging high overhead rates on grants--70% or more.  In computer
science there was no direct research support other than professorial
salaries.

> But that hardly made it a military enter-

Not a military enterprise, when colonels were doing project reviews?
Call it what you want but the military picked up the tab, and had they
not done so we would not have the net today--Congress never would have
funded pure computer science research at that scale.

Thought I'd float a few reportage pixels concerning the Post-War
Anglo-American Poetic Relations conference held at the University of
London's Centre for English Studies July 9-11.  Lots of good papers, though
with so many good panels going on simultaneously it was impossible to catch
all that I wanted to hear.  There were readings by Bob Perelman and
Jennifer Moxley as well, and to close out the conference James Tate and
John Ashbery.

Good talks by list-folks Bob Archambeau (on Donald Davie at Stanford),
Romana Huk (on Black British poetry), Alan Golding (Susan Howe and
Ireland/England), and Marjorie Perloff (on signature and subjectivity in
Silliman, Howe, Palmer, Scalapino, etc.).  Peter Barry argued the need for
a pedagogically-friendly anthology of experimental British poetry.  Geoff
Ward spoke on recent Ashbery; David Trotter read Olson beside Robert
Smithson in an effort to rescue a "minimal" Olson.  Robert Hampson followed
the wanderings of cris cheek across artforms and nations; Rod Mengham spoke
on Moxley's work with the poet in the room and offered his view of  the
wrestling with Keats etc. in JM's poetry.  The word "cartoon," I think, was
used as he thought about references to Greek myth in the poems, and this
became an issue, though the paper was thoughtful and ultimately flattering.

Frank O'Hara now has some very good British critics and scholars, including
(especially) Kevin Nolan, Shari Sabeti, and Graham MacPhee; absurdly
enough, these people were scheduled against a panel on the New York School.
I showed up for Alison Mark, Carol Watts, and Drew Milne on  Veronica
Forrest-Thomson (and also C. Bernstein in Milne's case) but refused to sit
in the hallway to hear it.  (No huge crowd, just a small room).  Did get
the core of it later from Milne.

Fascinated to learn at a different panel that there is now a cult of O'Hara
in Poland--the O'Hara-ists even.  This information courtesy of Krystyna
Mazur of the American Studies Center, Warsaw University,  whose excellent
paper included her translations of some of these poets.  Here's the opening
lines of her translation of  "Why I'm not a Grave-digger" by Derek Foks:

I am not a grave digger, I am a carpenter.
Why?  I think I would rather be
a grave digger, but I am a carpenter.  I work

with grave diggers.  I meet one:
he is beginning to dig.  I look at his shovel.
"Sit down and have a drink" he says.  I sit down
and drink.  We drink.  I look
at his shovel.  "You have tons of mud on it."
"I knew there's too much of something there."
"Oh."  I go and the days go by
and I drop in again.


And so on (and so on ).  I will resist the temptation to comment on this
phenomenon or the world-wide status of O'Hara and O'Hara-influence.  Ists
and isms also came up with the Scottish Informationists, briefly discussed
by Robert Crawford as he took up the poet-in-the-academy question.

Strangely, or maybe not so strangely, the two papers I'll probably remember
the best were ones that left me scratching and squirming.  Edna Longley
went on for an hour complaining that Ezra Pound and American Poundians
(Kenner etc.) had effectively but unfairly written W B Yeats out of
dominant versions of modernism.  Lots of good old American-bashing there,
which is always fun and probably even called for in some instances, but the
sumo wrestling Longley was describing seemed a little dated or out of touch
with the emerging and plural modernisms now alive in American literary
history and criticism as well as in contemporary poetic practice here or
anywhere.  Asked a question by your reporter, she refused to take seriously
the existence of traditions of Irish modernisms other than the Yeats line.
("These people are confused" is part of what she said in response to my
question about Brian Coffey, Denis Devlin, Catherine Walsh, Trevor Joyce,
etc.)

And then there was Helen Vendler's talk, which immediately preceded the
Tate-Ashbery reading (with no Q & A.).  Vendler talked about Ashbery.  She
said she didn't like most of his followers  because they have ideological
or political or religious axes to grind.

However, it turns out that there now is an Ashbery-esque (if that's the
word) poet Vendler can admire, though in the end he's more narrative than
JA, more concerned with the body, etc.  His name is Mark Ford, author of a
book I haven't read and thus can't comment on (_Landlocked_, Chatto &
Windus, 1992).  Grateful if somebody would fill me in a little more.

But that's not all.  Vendler also said that, before Mark Ford, England had
had no good poet since World War II.  Or so she has long thought, she said.


Yowie.

So much for Bunting or Prynne, Raworth or Roy Fisher, Alan Fisher or Denise
Riley, Charles Tomlinson, Tom Leonard, Maggie O'Sullivan--even Philip
Larkin or Geoffrey Hill or Lynette Roberts or Peter Redgrove or dozens and
dozens of contenders.   What a thing to say.  Maybe it was honest.  One
wonders who or what she's read.

So much for Anglo-American poetic relations.

OK, i can't resist this thread no matter what horrible late-nite revelations
it entails.  I confess:  i grew up in the sixties and seventies watching
leftover WWII propaganda films on Saturday afternoon TV, trying to figure out
what it mean to "be a man."  My great-grandfather was a Marine, my grandfather
was a Marine (and a boxer), my father merely served in Army, and i (the
gradual de-generation shld be clear) am a vegetarian more-or-less-pacifist
(tho, yes, i "would have gone"--interesting, since gender has so often, and
recently, been a subject here that this is such a notable male response to
the question of war and wars).   Up until the age of 10 or 11 at least those
explosive sacrifices and sacrificial
explosions sure did make me tingle, and there is a lingering susceptibility.
So one of my votes goes to a movie that manages to be both a war movie and an
anti-war movie at the same time, Preminger's In Harm's Way.  Yes, it features
John Wayne strutting in his dress whites (opposite the stunningly
down-to-earth Patricia Neal) but also glimpses him--hard to believe, even if
it's brief--terrified and shell-shocked.

I think that that use of the word "intellectuals" is not quite adequate
here. The Oulipo founders were interested in mathematics, and I remember
that during "that" time, for various reasons, not as many women as men were
excited about mathematics. My first-year math prof was a woman, but there
were not a lot of young women in my class, if I remember right.

**********************************************************
A Modernist Eye

A Review Of Trevor Joyce's  Syzygy By Michael Smith

The term " Modernism", as applied to the arts, has become so problematic
that one scarcely knows what it means any more. So far as literature is
concerned, however, I am taking Modernism to mean the use of language that
registers the uncertain status of common-sense reality or indeed of any
reality. Put another way, it is the use of language that questions the
referentiality of language, that no longer treats words as the unquestioned
naming of things or actions that are definitely "out there".

With that in mind, and allowing for some notable exceptions, one is forced
to admit that not a great deal of contemporary Irish literature, and in
particular Irish poetry, can lay claim to being Modernist. The general
practice has been and continues to be an unthinking use of language,
language as conditioned reflex, with the implicit assumption of an
unequivocal reality accessible to agreed by all. An analogy for this
literary condition might be painting that ignored the invention of the
camera. Of course, the academics, or many of them, know what has been
happening in our understanding of language. But by and large their
knowledge stays in the lecture-rooms of academe; and for the purpose of
"communicating" with the great uninitiated public, in newspaper reviews,
for example, these academics are only too willing to fall back on the
accepted "norms" of language and literary appreciation.

Thus we still read about the "realistic grittiness" of novelist X or "the
sombre portrayal" of Irish life by writer Y or "the sensuousness" of Z's
poetry; and we are smugly back in the age of Victoria. Joyce and Beckett
did their thing, and Bord Fáilte are truly grateful to them, but there are
more important matters to think about, thank you very much, like selling
the film rights and making lots of money and being quoted by politicians
and appearing on chat shows and being relevant to the Northern situation,
etc.

It is not my intention to malign anyone. My purpose, rather, is to attempt
to diagnose, or at least point to, an Irish cultural, specifically
literary, condition: language as a quantifiable tribal property, to be
bought and sold as any other commodity. This is a serious condition, well
worth attention. If, as Auden once said, echoing Pound, poets are the
antennae of their society, a society is ill-served by poets who give
society what it wants and not what poets believe to be true. It may be that
this linguistic conservatism is not unique to the Irish poetic situation,
but many Irish poets have bough into the myth that the Irish are
linguistically better endowed than other peoples, that poetry comes to them
more "naturally", that they have simply to lay bare their soul in
metaphorically neatly packaged, emotionally laden vignettes and, voilà!
That magical object, the poem, makes its appearance.

As a result of the dominance of this poetic conservatism, experimentation
among Irish poets is indeed a rare thing. And this state of affairs is all
the more regrettable when one considers that two of the greatest literary
experimenters of the 20th century, Joyce and Beckett, were Irish.

All of which brings me, albeit circuitously, to the latest work by the
little-known (for commercial reasons but probably the most experimental of
contemporary Irish poets - Trevor Joyce. Syzygy, Joyce's latest work, is
presented as a text comprising three parts: the first two are verse, titled
respectively "The Drift" and "The Net", while the third, two pages of
prose, provides "Some Notes".

"The Drift" is a sequence of a dozen brief poems, whose tone and manner are
recognisably that of the traditional lyric, though here they are stripped
down and intensified in passages of puzzling if fascinating density. This,
for example, is the seventh of those lyric pieces, perhaps an elegy,
perhaps not:

in three quarters now you lie
lacking a fourth
of your voice that flew at once away
not a tremor breeds with the marble orchard
and is it that this simply is either finished or not
or not yet begun
perhaps truly not begun
twig of bone empty still
until there come the words
now quite forgotten whats the air
the sun leans down
and lifts the sea

"The Net" is a single, unpunctuated passage of twenty-four three-line
verses from which this is a representative segment:

squares mesh of close actions
griefs are grounds the twig of bone of time and
the sun sun where they sleep centuries new

abstracts attentions of clocks so that eventually stay
empty still tamed rage is heavy influence
leaves howling as wood does not rise

you attend and to the distracted mum unerringly
elements turn the tempting until there come reduced
broke sometimes fierce the dream on the grass

hearing each hour and the child to the infinities
metals in parks only perhaps along the words over
and weary the shadow is mistaken disordered

The relation between the first two parts is complex and rigorously worked.
They are composed of the same phrases, identically, with the order of those
phrases mapped between the two parts through an abstract symmetrical
patterning, which is easier to sample than to describe. If you focus on the
mid-lines of the verses quoted from "The Net" you will see familiar phrases
from "The Drift" recur: "twig of bone empty still/until there come the
words" intercut with phrases from adjacent sections of part one:
"intelligence and griefs are tamed/rage is reduced in parks (#5), brief
zones/of time and influence/the tasty metals of the air (#6), and fishing
the empty grounds/the heavy elements/turn over in their sleep (#8)".

The effect of this structuring is strange and, so far as I know, unique in
poetry. "The Notes" refer the reader to the work of the 14th-century French
poet and composer Machaut, but surely it is unnecessary to reach back in
this manner to justify a contemporary poem, merely because it is so densely
ordered. The gesture is required only because of the inertness and
insensitivity to form of so much current work. But the invocation of
musical analogues is suggestive, as "The Drift" and "The Net" pick up,
interweave, drop and resume their themes, touching on love, death, time,
chaos, order and dirt in the manner of a fugue.

"There is nothing either finished or not yet begun", says "The Net", and
this is borne out in Syzygy, which can never find a place of rest, apart
from the dynamic of the poem. "The Notes" strain to bed the details of the
lyrics in the facts of the world, granting them a stability at the cost of
narrowing their reference, but "The Net" explodes this tendency, ripping
the measured words from the territories they have ordered, where they are
safe, and freeing them to the use of the imagination, at the cost of
imperilling their familiar purchase on the world. And is it that this
simply is words asks "The Net". It is not.

No, they didn't - Truman integrated the troops, but did so either just
before or during the Korean War.  The fact that Speilberg didn't show ant
minority soldiers crossed my mind too, but since he was basically showing
one company getting crushed on D-Day I didn't consider it a malignantly
ahistorical thing.  As for the film in general, which I haven't yet chimed
in on, I'll stand up for those first 25 minutes - Anthony Lane points out
smartly in the new NYer that the power of that sequence stems not from its
"realism" by from its stylized and rhetorical emphasis on the randomness
and essential unknowability of war/violence: to wit: there is almost no
dialogue for these 25 minutes, & as Lane points out, unlike Peckinpah,
Speilberg doesn't fetishize the wound (I'm a big fan of The Wild Bunch but
Lane is absolutely right about this) - Speilberg moves from shot to shot
so quickly you don't have time as a viewer to admire the aesthetics of the
good kill shot.  So that sequence is to my mind damn good filmmaking with
some real social value.  Unfortunately, I though the rest pretty much
sucked & agree with Lane that what would have been really striking (but,
alas, from Speilberg impossible!) would have been a whole 2 hr movie
based on the same style as that beginning, with some equally random and
disjunctive down-time.  For me the worst part of the film was the
present-day sequence which bookends the WW2 story - sugary and silly,
Speilberg can't help but hammer home a redemptive message which in light
of the Normandy scene feels completely bogus.  But that Normandy scene
will stick with me.     -m.

One person's experience:  my father spend a part of WWII at Vancouver
Barracks training "colored" officers to lead "colored" troops in the
Quartermaster Corps.   When these men were shipped out, their mission was
to follow the white troops onto the beaches of Normandy and "clean up,"
meaning, it seems, bury people and get blown up by mines.

Thanx to Keith Tuma for a superb conference report...

Are you sure the entire Polish Oharista movement isn't someone's idea of
a joke?  Sounds like it (fairly amusing one too)   Maybe it's just that
the work of Yasusada has badly destabilized the epistomology of improbable
poetic identities...Or maybe i just feel defensive about the homeland of
my parents' families!  (Poland, i mean, not NYC...)

The Vendler stuff is a stitch.  She is truely the Ronnie Reagan of poetic
reaction:  no matter how much of a caricature people turn her into, she
goes several steps further in banality and stupidity...I realize that by
this point (as happened with that other great communicator) it has become
tedious to point out how bankrupt her drivel is.  But 1. like Ronnie, she
holds enuff power that it's kinda hard to ignore her;  2. she really tends
to sum up very well the most conservative trends in the literary
establishment.

As a huge McDiarmid fan, not in touch with the last couple of decades of
Scottish work, i found the "informationist" tag intriguing..  Anyone know
of a good anthology or other source to focus on recent Scottish work?

...have we really overthrown Yeats and cast him into the outer darkness,
in favor of Pound?  Has the treatment of Yeats in academe really changed
so radically since i went to college in the seventies??  I realize many of
us working poets are more likely to read Zuke or H.D., but has the
establishment really dropped the adulation of WBY that i grew up with?
(...that wouldn't be so bad a thing, not because i don't love much of
Yeats, but because like TSE and others he had a cult stretching over quite
a few decades in mid-20th century academe that was excessive, boring and
used up more of students' energy than any single poet should..)

tendentiously,

mark

That would be Allen (not Alan) Fisher, my now slighty less sleep-deprived
eyes tell me as I look over the typing of my reportage.

And I also forgot to mention a very useful, densely informing paper I heard
given by Andrew Crozier on the virtually unknown 30s left poet Harry
Roskolenko, called "(Fourth) International Modernism:  The Case of Harry
Rosolenko; or, Apocalyptic Transports of an Objectivist."

Thank you Keith Tuma for your news: how you could remember so much so vividly
after three weeks is a wonder.

I can't contribute much to your query about Mark Ford except to say that
Ashbery read a few of his poems at MIT last fall (along with Holderlin,
Moore, Bishop, and Tate) before getting to his own work.  I vaguely
remember there being murmurs of curiosity from the audience after the Ford
poems, and Ashbery remarked at some point that his work was not available
in the U.S., with the air of someone who had acquired a special treat and
was obligingly sharing it with the rest of us.

Let's see...There are very good essays on her in John Taggart's book Songs
of Degrees and in one (or more) of Perloff's books; and (i'm pretty sure)
in Hank Lazer's Opposing Poetries.

(As hank knows, i'm working my way thru OP, while immersed in about 10
other projects..And *everything* in it is well-focused and exceptionally
useful and lucid, in a perloffian vein you might say;  if i misremember
about there being a howe essay, he or someone can correct me..As always
the book is at home and i can't double-check it today...)

I would just   **read the stuff**  ....i'm not sure you will see what i
consider so remarkable in her work, if you need arguments to convince you.

The important books are:  The Europe of Trusts; Singularities; and The
Non-Conformist's Memorial.  Then you can go back to the early poetry
collected in the recent book Frame Structures. Much of it is brilliant,
some a bit apprentice.

I reduced the atlanta poets group to raucous laughter one night by
declaring that i considered Howe the most important living US poet.  Not
that they dislike her work:  it was the idea that anyone thought he could
make such a claim about any one poet, that had 'em rolling in the ailes.
These pomo kids, what're'ya gonna do??  No respect for their elders like
in my time... Jeeeez

Anyway, she is that, and more.

Having seen the film last night,  I pretty much concur with Michael's
assessment. The opening set piece is a true tour de force. Unfortunately, it
operates more or less independently of the rest of the film, which leads me
to wonder if it was even a part of the original script. Spielberg afterall
is somewhat obsessed with WWII ("1941," "Empire of the Sun," "Always"
(remake of a Guy Named Joe), the first and third Indiana Jones films, and
"Schindler." This obsession goes to the heart of his putative vision, as I
read it, namely the longing for the restoration of a lost moral order.
Unlike other filmmakers who have grappled with this same issue, though, this
longing is unsupported by any intellectual toughness and  inevitably decays
into mushy nostalgia.

After the opener, the film becomes a genre rehash, with on-the-nose squad
hijinks, wisecracks and various perils. A few good scenes stand out; though
the script is generally very weak, very broad. The acting, though, is superb
(really, the best thing in the film). Except for Matt Damon, who is badly
miscast - too iconic, as my wife remarked. And Spielberg does have a genius
for framing the ideological moment in a very affecting way. The film is
being trumpeted of course as non-ideological - though the opening and
closing shots are of a backlit, sun-bleached US flag. So much for that.
Really, the whole thing is a gigantic ghost story. Only it fails to engage
the issues of memory and how the dead continue to exact a toll on the
living. If it had ventured more deeply into that territory, it could have
been quite good.

Ah, I remember it well.  Holderlin drank too much at the reception and
started hitting on Elizabeth Bishop -- good think Marianne arrived with
her impeccable manners and defused the situation.

Zbigniew Herbert, 73, a Poet Who Sought Moral Values

By HARVEY SHAPIRO

<Picture: Z>bigniew Herbert, the Polish poet and essayist who insisted that
civilization depended on artists' staking out clear moral positions
resistant to the winds of history and ideology, died yesterday in Warsaw. He
was 73.

The cause of death was not disclosed, but a longtime friend and fellow poet,
Krzysztof Karasek, said Mr. Herbert had asthma and serious circulatory
problems.

The Polish poet Wislawa Szymborska, the 1996 Nobel laureate, told the PAP
news agency that Mr. Herbert was a "great artist and thinker" and that he
would have an eternal place in Polish literature.

Mr. Herbert's poetry defied categorization. It spoke for no philosophy or
school and favored no party or dogma. Although he was a political poet who
explored the mechanisms of power and ideology, he resisted Fascism and
Communism, nationalism and the church and was willing to pay the price of
such moral independence. He gave the impression of being a man alone,
answerable to no one except his own conscience.

Place and history determined Mr. Herbert's career as a poet. He lived much
of his adult life under the ideologies of National Socialism and Communism.
The impingement of the political, the political becoming personal, informed
all of his work.

To the chaos of the 20th century, to which he was a personal witness, Mr.
Herbert brought a mind trained in law and disciplined by classical
literature. It was a mind that would not succumb to self-pity or nostalgia,
a mind steeled against chaos.

In "Pebble," one of his best-known poems, he wrote:



Pebbles cannot be tamed
to the end they will look at us
with a calm and very clear eye



Those lines could describe his stance as a writer. The poet Robert Hass once
said that Mr. Herbert wrote as if it were "the task of the poet, in a world
full of loud lies, to say what is irreducibly true in a level voice."

Mr. Herbert was born in the city of Lvov, then part of Poland and now in
Ukraine, in 1924. (The name Herbert is pronounced as in English; in fact,
Mr. Herbert claimed the 17th-century English poet George Herbert as a
distant relation.) In 1939, as a 15-year-old, he experienced the annexation
of his hometown by the Soviet Union. When the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact
collapsed, the city was then seized by the Germans. At the end of the war it
was recaptured by the Soviet Union, which retained control over the Baltic
republics.

Mr. Herbert wrote his first poems during the Nazi occupation of Poland. As
Stanislaw Baranczak, a critic who teaches at Harvard University, has
observed, "The image of a city under siege, one of the several symbols that
constantly recur in his work, has a historical poignancy that makes it much
more than just a figure of speech."

Mr. Herbert took part in the Polish resistance to the Nazi occupiers. When
the war ended, he enrolled at the University of Cracow, where he received a
master's degree in economics. Later he earned a law degree from Nicolas
Copernicus University and a degree in philosophy from the University of
Warsaw.

Stalinist restrictions on writers after the war and Mr. Herbert's refusal to
bend to Communist dogma and the party functionaries in the Writers' Union
impeded the publication of his poetry for 15 years.

During that period he developed his distinctive voice, a style, as the
author Eva Hoffman has written, "that functions as a sort of antidote to the
dangers of sentimentality or inflation -- restrained, ironic, stripped of
punctuation, averse to 'tricks of the imagination' and passionate in its
insistence on precision."

His first three volumes of poetry, "A String of Light" (1956), "Hermes, a
Dog and a Star" (1957) and "The Study of an Object" (1961), established him
as a dominant figure in Polish literature. His search for moral and
humanistic values would make a strong impression on his contemporaries and
earn him an international audience.

Many poems in those books also appear in the volumes of his poetry available
in English: "Selected Poems," translated by Czeslaw Milosz and Peter Dale
Scott (Ecco Press, 1986); "Selected Poems" (Oxford Press, 1977), translated
by John and Bodgana Carpenter; "Report From the Besieged City," translated
by the Carpenters (Ecco Press, 1985), and "Mr. Cogito," also translated by
the Carpenters (Ecco Press, 1993).

Mr. Herbert was a modernist in that he wrote in free form, without rhyme and
meter. He was an antimodernist in that his work frequently jumped off from
Greek myth, Shakespeare and the Latin poets, and in his refusal to ape
chaos. In an essay in praise of the great Dutch painters of the 17th
century, he explained, "A major part of contemporary art declares itself on
the side of chaos, gesticulates in a void, or tells the story of its own
barren soul."

Against this attitude, he posed the painters of that period in the
Netherlands, who "believed in the purposefulness of their work and the
possibility of interhuman communication. They affirmed visible reality with
an inspired scrupulousness." And they did that, he asserted, "as if the
order of the world and the revolution of the stars, the permanence of the
firmament, depended on it."

Yet there is nothing in Mr. Herbert's poetry to suggest that a traditional,
conventional art, one imitating the art of the past, could carry today's
meanings. On the contrary, in one of his strongest poems, "Apollo and
Marsyas," he describes how pain can dictate a new art. Marsyas, a mortal in
the myth on which the poem is based, loses a musical contest to Apollo, the
Greek god of beauty, who signifies classical control ("absolute ear/versus
immense range"). Apollo punishes Marsyas for daring to challenge his
authority by flaying him alive. Describing Marsyas's pain, Mr. Herbert
writes:



only seemingly
is the voice of Marsyas
monotonous
and composed of a single vowel
Aaa

in reality
Marsyas relates
the inexhaustible wealth
of his body

bald mountains of liver
white ravines of aliment

As Apollo departs to that sound, he wonders "whether out of Marsyas's
howling/there will not someday arise/a new kind/ of art . . . "

And to describe the effect of that art, Mr. Herbert writes:



suddenly
at his feet
falls a petrified nightingale

he looks back
and sees that the hair of the tree to which
Marsyas was fastened
is white
completely

And so the poem ends, moving the myth completely into the 20th century. The
pared-down rhetoric, its terse description, is classical (seen with Apollo's
eye) but the poem is savage, because it was written in a savage time and
because its author believed that art must find a way to reconcile beauty
with the reality of human suffering.

Mr. Herbert's stark rhetoric is more than a stylistic characteristic. It
signals a moral concern, openly stated in many of his poems, that the path
to such reconciliation is to see the world clearly, steadily, with an eye
toward understanding it and then writing about it truthfully. His poem "Mr.
Cogito and the Imagination," for example, begins:



Mr. Cogito never trusted
tricks of the imagination
the piano at the top of the Alps
played false concerts for him



(He took "the piano at the top of the Alps" from Rimbaud's "Illuminations,"
a source of the surreal in modern art.)

Later in the poem Mr. Herbert focuses on his theme:



he adored tautologies
explanations
idem per idem

that a bird is a bird
slavery means slavery
a knife is a knife
death remains death



Mr. Cogito inhabits many of Mr. Herbert's poems, a character in search of
moral certainties. He is an ordinary man who enjoys reading trashy newspaper
stories and who fails when he tries transcendental meditation: "his stream
of consciousness brings up detritus like a tin can." He is also Mr.
Herbert's mouthpiece, a way of distancing himself from himself.

In the Cogito poems Mr. Herbert became his own subject, but they are not
confessional poems in the tradition of Robert Lowell, Sylvia Plath and Anne
Sexton. They do not dramatize the ego; they dramatize a mind and the way it
looks at the world. Ultimately, they return us to the world, as do all of
his poems, and the search for what is durable in our lives, for what is
attainable.

In "The Envoy of Mr. Cogito," he appears to be looking back on his life in
Poland during the long years of war and repression. It begins:

Go where those others went to the
dark boundary
for the golden fleece of nothing- ness your last prize



go upright among those who are
on their knees
among those with their backs
turned and those toppled in the
dust



you were saved not in order to live
you have little time you must give testimony

Mr. Herbert was co-editor of a poetry journal, Poezja, from 1965 to 1968 but
resigned in protest of anti-Semitic policies. He traveled widely through the
West and lived in Paris, Berlin and the United States, where he taught
briefly at the University of California at Los Angeles. In one of his essay
collections several years ago, "Still Life With a Bridle," translated by the
Carpenters (Ecco Press, 1991) he goes in search of the Dutch bourgeois in
the golden age of Dutch culture, the 17th century.

After a break of several years from writing, Mr. Herbert, who is survived by
his wife, Katarzyna, wrote new poems in 1997 when his health improved
slightly. The result was "Storm's Epilogue," published this year.

Mr. Herbert once gave this advice to younger writers: "Life is more
complicated, more mysterious and more convoluted than the party, the army,
the police. Let us detach ourselves a little from this truly horrible
everyday reality and try to write about doubt, anxiety and despair."

I must say: the discussion on Spielberg seems way out of line for the
list.
Not that I'm suggesting a censor --or trying to stop the discussion--but
the man as an artist isn't! He rewrites history in a clumsy albeit
monetary way--see Schindler's List--see that he is in the habit of
recreating a Heroic mythology--a cartoon strip--and has been quoted as
saying that "the great war movies of the 40's inspired (him)" Let's see

a film about a shark (which he had to be pushed into doing)
a film about an alien (a boyhood idea stolen really from Geroge Lucas)
another film about aliens (WOW!)
a film about the ATlantic Slave Trade (he was SUED for this one!)
a film
                        a film
                                                a film?

WHOOPS--I meant "movie"!

Spillberg (no typo) HAS destroyed the film industry--he won that war!
The great films of the 60s and 70s he single handedly destroyed when he
found out he couldn't make one! (No "humanity" or "personality" in his
films! Read RAGING BULLS and EASY RIDERS! His first film was THE
SUGERLAND EXPRESS--trying to be Altman, trying to be Scorsessem etc!) He
was raised on TV for god's sake!  The big MACHINERY he p[roduced--the
studio he saved (UNIVERSAL) they both overtook the great films of Hal
Asbhy (Harold and Maude, Shampoo, etc--films that made money!), Altman,
Scorsesee(his great films hardly were released! Yup--Taxi Driver did not
make the man wealthy!) Even Coppola (and left him a rather commercial
idiot I maight say--from Godfather and Apocylypse NOW (a GREAT "war"
movie--a movie that took a war into the lens--to "Jack" and
.........)

Phew.

Hey..I guess this is fun!

Back to the poem.........


What about poetic Heroes anyway--like Spicer?

Actually, I think that this is a little unfair. I hope I didn't caricature
her, didn't mean to. However much I disagree with HV and her canons and/or
methods, she's a passionate advocate of what she believes in.  No doubting
her influence and its consequences but even when she, say, dismisses Mina
Loy she circulates discourse.  My guess is that her politics are liberal,
old-style humanist and all.  Probably voted for Clinton.  The case for her
"Reaganism" would need to be argued.  And I take it that her view/neglect
of recent British poetries is symptomatic and partly the result of a lack
of information for which the causes are many and complex.  Which is not to
say that after she notices--if she does--forthcoming anthologies like the
Quartermain and Caddel she'll suddenly take up exegesis and critique of the
poets included therein.

I suppose that at her level of visibility one must expect criticism and
like anybody else she should be called on her blindnesses but not via cheap
shots.  Not to single you out in this regard and of course somehow the big
E seems to encourage these as if it were itself an agent of noise and
effusive dialogue on the edges of spectacle.  Long live its ephemeral blur.

Robert Crawford's scholarly books would be one place to start and he's
edited a forthcoming penguin anthology which will have some of these folks
in it and might even make it to the US.  There's an anthology of younger
Scots as well, though I don't have it in front of me and forget the title
and like so much else it's unavailable in the US anyway.  W. N. Herbert's
work would be one place to start for this nexus though I'd go back and find
Tom Leonard and others.

        Not sure if you know this, but Vendler has
been a champion of Yeats (over, indeed, Pound and
Eliot) both in the classroom and in her published
work. I spent a term studying WBY under her at Harvard.
In general, before you start wrecking on a particular
person, remember that, chances are, someone else on
the list is going to know them; a lesson I learnt
quickly (hi, Henry.) Interesting, right before I
came to University, I read the APR article that went
house on Vendler; when I studied under her, I was
much impressed by the meanspiritedness of the assesment.

        Since when did we get the idea that professors
in the academy should be responsible for keeping up
with the Protean world of contemporary poetry? Isn't
it enough for them to apply their knowledge and skill
to the poets they like? We accept the academies as
repositories of history, but I'm not sure I want to
accept them as scribes of the "accepted" poetry,
whether that be Zukofsky, Eliot or Keats.

It was a monumental break in my own life when I realized
that my poetic education has guided me down a very
particular path, and that, from a height, one could
look down and see thousands of different tracks through
the wood; to criticize a particular critic for missing
contemporary or near-contemporary trends seems to be
akin to complaining that you want a better hand-holder.
Certaintly, critics hold power over the NYT Sunday Book
Review crowd, but, hell, they're the direct genetic
descendents of the people who read Swinburne.

Nice reading report from London.

It reminds me that there is an anthology forthcoming from Weslayan in the
fall--"OTHER." The complete Introduction is on-line at the JACKET website
<<http://www.jacket.zip.com.au/jacket04/otherbrit.html>>

I read it and realized I know very few of the poets included. Obviously this
is my own fault; or is it? Is it wrong to ask why "some fifty non-mainstream
poets" writing in a language I "know" are so unfamiliar to me. The few that
I know/have read are due, in part, to their work having been introduced to
me by Keston Sutherland--an English poet. Is the world so big? Am I alone?
Is anyone else looking forward to checking out this book?

If "so much for anglo-americo relations," what about the rest of the planet?

Let's see....i don't think i've used up my quota of posts yet..

Keith and Simon put me to shame with their generosity toward the infamous
Vendler.  (..especially Keith, who i think is somewhat closer to my own
poetix...)

No doubt i was being very cantankerous.  But i really feel Mark Weiss was
right to toss in the comment he did:  Vendler is so actively clueless
about poetic form and contemporary work, that she has a real impact on
where resources go for poetry, in our society.  No i don't think she is
just a professor and scholar doing work on poets several generations back;
she has strong (and laughable) opinions about the contemporary state of
the art, and expresses 'em in reviews and articles and public statements
and in her books.

I think her conservatism is cartoonishly exaggerated and flat and
not-thought-out....Very much like the great Rondini's.  No the point of
the comparison was not to suggest she has *right-wing beliefs* with regard
to politix.  I was talking about her esthetic hyperconservatism.  And as i
said, like Ron she has become *too easy* to laugh at, because of the
clodish simplicity of her conservatism.  But as Alex Cockburn pointed out
about Reagan, a person with institutional power can work against you quite
effectively, regardless of whether you perceive them as clownlike..

I'm wondering if anyone who has read Charles Cantaloupo would be
willing to venture a few words about his work/context either on the list
or to me backchannel. I would very much appreciate it.

Thanks very much in advance.

Afraid I've got to agree w/ Todd here-- & was resisting my own impulses
to say something similar.  I've always hated Schpielberg's "art" (albeit
cognizant of his craft, in both senses)-- & felt he at the time he was
iconic of conservative cultural trends of the 80s.  (C.f. what was just
posted viz Ronnie Reagan & Helen Vendler, which also probably could've
gone w/out saying, & which also was dead on)....

I also wanted to thank you, Keith, for an engaging post, & postscripts.

Re: the O'Harista thing-- if not a joke, shocking.  What imitators, from
the Lower East Side to Poland, always seem to me to miss-- & this is
clearly brought out in the excerpt you quote-- is the social gesture
integral to O'Hara's "personist" (i.e., less abstract, most famous)
work.  Style, thus-- in an irony apparently lost on the O'Harista--
becomes abstracted from the social, making the poem literally into an
artifact, which is something that O'Hara clearly was trying to
circumvent.  The transposition of contexts from the 1950s NY art world
of "Why I Am Not A Painter," to the 90s Polish laborer in the excerpt
you quote, thus makes for unintentional parody, completely undermining
what (one presumes) is the intended effect.  (Though I'd be interested
to read more on the poetics of this O'Harista movement).

Re: Vendler-- I don't think it's unfair.  Yes, she is probably a good
left/liberal, but so is Speilberg (see my previous post).  What is
_conservative_ in both cases is not the espoused politics (though from
an anarchist perspective one might argue differently), but the cultural
politics: in Vendler's case as a critic, in Speilberg's case as a
filmmaker.  Vendler's project, it seems to me, is one of canon-making;
if she dismisses Loy, for example, I'm sure that is her personal
reaction, but it is also a public dismissal that (she realizes) will
probably turn some readers away from Loy's work.  Her totalizing (not
even apologetic) dismissal of figures like Prynne & Raworth, among
others, speaks for itself.  It is not as if Vendler ever elevates a poet
like Mac Low, for example.  Her's is clearly a political project with
regard to culture-- the reification of a singular aesthetic.  I don't
even think she would deny this.

I've only seen Saving Private Ryan once and so am hesitant to write
anything critically about it.  However, I have no intention of seeing it
again and so offer these comments with the apology in advance that my
memory of the film may at times be inaccurate.

The ultimate failure of the film, it seems to me, rests not with the issue
of "realism" or "history" or "morality" but with its failure to remain
consistent with the logic it establishes for itself in the 25 minutes on
Omaha Beach.  The logic it seems to be establishing for itself in those 25
shocking minutes is somewhere around "War is Hell" and "The only glory in
war is surviving" - the logic, as has been observed, of The Big Red One
and All Quite on the Western Front.  The Omaha Beach scenes establish war
as messy, capricious, horrible, and chaotic: rank, class, religion, etc.
all mean nothing in terms of who lives and who is wounded and who dies.
The beach is the site of "chance. Once the film privileges the 8 man
squad, however, the film radically alters its logic and therefore its
attitude toward "war". The focus shifts from the countless men at the
beach WHO WE KNOW AND LEARN NOTHING ABOUT (including the defenders, one of
whom speaks in Czech, I believe, when he tries to surrender) to the 8 man
squad and the obstacles they encounter and their fates.  The film attempts
to remain true to the logic established on the beach (in the interrogation
of the Emerson quote about the nobility of war, the death of the soldier
who tried to save the girl, etc) but slowly transforms itself from a D-Day
film to a "platoon" film, to a "bridge" film and, ultimately, into a "last
stand" film. The "war is hell logic" gives way to a "it's a good day to
die" logic (the current, popular, heroic action adventure cliche, I
believe) where the heroes get to choose when, where and largely how they
die).  The cavalry arrives just in the nick of time to save the bridge and
the war if not quite all the characters we have been manipulated into
knowing just enough to care about.  The many deaths on the beach give way
to the few significant deaths of the squad.  The Germans start to look
like Indians from countless westerns (notice how in Hollywood WWII films
the Germans always manage to outnumber Americans) and the holding of the
bridge becomes just one more fort the outnumbered Cavarly must defend "at
all costs."  Why?  Because Rommel is on the way?  Because "if we do this
we earn the right to go home?" Because "somebody has to do it"? or because
its a spectacular, sentimental way to end a film?

As such, it seems to me, the film is best compared, if we are to stick to
war films, not to the various films on D-Day or on WWII in general, or to
the many "platoon" films, but instead, as Marjorie Perloff suggested, to
"bridge" films:  The Bridge at Remagen, The Bridge on the River Kwai, A
Bridge too Far, The Bridges at Toko-Ri (also with William Holden), etc.  I
don't think it ranks very highly in this list because, in the simplest
sense, the bridge just does not amount to much: it's an unimpressive stone
bridge across a river you could throw a rock over.  Visually, unlike the
previous bridges mentioned, it is not interesting.

More importantly, perhaps, by the time the squad reaches the bridge, all
of the chaos of Omaha Beach and the absurd order to have 8 men try and
save 1 and whatever pretense it has for being "historically" accurate and
"realistic"  is lost and the film becomes cliche driven - just exactly
like the John Wayne film The Alamo (which is the name Capt Miller gives
the building where they are supposed to retreat to).  The issue at the
bridge is not "war" or "anti war" or "WWII" but how most of the squad die
and how their deaths are given transcendent meaning (and if we did not get
the "meaning" of their deaths when the cavalry arrive, we better get it
when grandfather Ryan and his children and grandchildren are at the
cemetary at the end).

Whereas, in the film, on Omaha Beach death could occur at any moment in
the most dehumanizing way, at the bridge all of the remaining Rangers get
their heroic moments - each dies after valiantly fighting and killing many
Germans (remember the logic of the John Wayne film:  for every hero
that dies, before he dies, he has to kill 5 bad guys).  None of the squad
at the bridge die messy deaths and most of them get to say a word or two
before they go (no images of Hanks with his guts spilling out, please).

In other words, the film becomes exactly what it argues it is not - just
another cliche (and, let me add,I think Schlinder's List becomes just
exactly what it argues against as well...).

Excellent analysis, David. And I'll shut up about it after this but just to
add to your list of "Bridge films" (hadn't quite realized what a genre it
was!) Frank Perry's WWII film called "The Bridge" from the early 60's.
Depicts ragtag group of German boys, average age 12-14, Hitler Youth I
guess, defending a bridge into Berlin. Haven't seen it in years, but I think
they all get killed. Very bleak, bitter film.

Richard Slotkin treats the ideology of The Alamo/Custer's Last Stand in
American myth at length in the second volume of his Gunfighter Nation
trilogy, _The Fatal Environment_. Well worth checking out.

KFI-AM radio out here in Southern California has a wonderful talk show on
from 7-11pm called the Phil Hendrie Show. Phil was talking about Saving
Private Ryan with Doug Dangur, an entertainment writer for the Orange
County Courier. As a gay man, Dangur saw SPR as a metaphor for the struggle
of Gays and Lesbians in America.

Some of the connections he found between the film and the struggle for gay
liberation:

        *Mussolini shaved his head so it would be a phallic symbol

        *D-Day is an obvious reference to Doris Day

        *The German goose step was developed by a dance instructor

One of his final observations:

        *He hadn't actually seen the film, he had just seen clips and WWII newsreels.

Charles Cantalupo has a sense of maximalism that fits with Sean Killian
except the subject material is centered in the world instead of a
non-descript setting bearing a comparable lattices with the mind.
Cantalupo has an exquisite sense of journey throughout his best work, in
the manner of the Blakean movement of Jerusalem or Patchen's Albion
Moonlight. The movement rotates around the subject and is fairly
difficult to keep track of but well worth the effort. I sincerely admire
Joe Napora for dedicating over 20 pages to "Columba, The Dove" in
Bullhead #5, there might even be a sample up on the website. While that
action might have played a part in sinking the press, to have the honor
of publishing a work such as Columba is worth it.

I'd be interested in what others have to say, if there were any
responses, backchannel.

Be well

Marjorie:

You mentioned that you found my question creepy. But I think you
(along with David B, Alan S., and Maxine C.) misunderstood my intent:
I was not asking whether or not it was a good thing to fight
fascism! Actually, if I could choose my death (imagining myself for a
moment with courage I probably don't have), I think it would be to
travel in time to die on a barricade in Warsaw or Madrid.
That would be, from my perspective, a "good" death.

(Now here would be a "creepy" but fascinating thread for the
List sometime: How would the different poets and critics here like to
die?)

Really, what I was pointing toward (obliquely, I admit) is the way
"good war" has become a a kind of propaganda buzz-idea,
ideologically loaded and mobilized in the construction of an official
myth of national "goodness"-- a myth that Spielberg's film will
powerfully contribute to shaping and strengthening. It's a myth that
continues to help obscure the real history of U.S. deceit,
aggression, and subversion of democracy around the world in the wake
of WW2. It helps obscure the fact that WW2 was a conflict between
rapacious imperialist states on _both_ sides. It was certainly good
that the side that lost, lost. But the side that won was not good,
nor was it "anti-fascist" in any principled sense, as Washington's
and Wall Street's support of fascistic regimes in the post-war period
makes perfectly clear.

So the question I asked seems quite reasonable to me and
also quite relevant to our current situation, for it won't likely be
long before we have another Gulf War or worse, and we will all be
asked to remember how the old Gulf War was a "good war", just as we
were being asked to remember how WWII was a "good war" as we
were being readied for the Gulf War.

In other words, the enemy might be clear, but for the sake of the
future it is good to know for whom one is fighting. This is
some of what I had in the back of my mind when I asked my question.

And by the way, David Erben, you should publish that fine analysis of
the movie somewhere!

I was wondering if anyone would reply with a list of some MFA/Poetics
programs that they considered good. I'm considering getting an MFA in
writing or a PhD in Poetics after I graduate from Berkeley this year. One
of the most problematic things is that there is no (at least I haven't
found it yet) comprehensive list of MFA programs in the country and who
teaches at those programs.

Subject:      Re: Was it a "good war"?

Regarding all these threads on different war movies and
the "good versus bad" wars -- there still seems to me,
as I wrote in a previous e-mail -- a fundamental difference
between fictional recreations of war (or the semi-"documetary"
versions that Speilberg churns out) and the "representation"
of war itself. By the very virtue that you are watching something
'unreal', projected onto a screen or written in a poem, you
are forced away from the political realities; how much difference
is there, really, between a WWII movie and Lawerence of Arabia?
Both depict the "horrors of war" -- people getting stuck with
knives and shot with guns -- and both, it seems to me, are
equally ineffective in making people dislike war any less.

All the glossy weeklies are probably waxing elqouent about
the horrors of war as depicted in "Saving Private Ryan"; these
are the same people that got us all riled up for the Gulf. And
the same audience that gets teary eyed in the movie house
goes gungho for the video cameras on smart bombs. And while
Kubrick certaintly made a good movie (Full Metal Jacket), I
think the only lasting effect it's had has been to popularize
a few choice phrases from the drill seargent.

I'm not saying that war poetry is not "effective"; there is,
of course, a lot of excellent work. Wilfred Owen, Benjamin
Britten's _War Requiem_; but am I the only one who sees a
fundamental split between people's aesthetic and ethical
responses? I think I count Plato as company for starters,
but anybody who reads the _Cantos_ probably recognizes the
same kind of internal block.

I'm not so ready to regard Harry Mathews' comment about hopscotch as
"deliberately evasive and even meaningless", although of course there may
have been some snideness in its delivery which doesn't come through.
Although it might be read as being flip, I read it as rejecting the
simplistically essentialist assumption that women are not interested in
strict mathematical rules.

Hopscotch might just be one example of a 'traditional women's activity'
that relies upon "the strict application of rules and limitation". Knitting
(and other fabric arts) and music are perhaps other examples of activities
where explicit rules are used. Perhaps it is not the presence or absence of
rules that discourages women, but the social context of the activity. In
that case, might Mathews' comment not be seen as addressing the question
rather than dismissing it?

Henry says that "during 'that' time, for various reasons, not as many women
as men were excited about mathematics". It's not just 'that' time: in my
maths honours class (late 80s) there were 5 men and no women; and there was
only one woman on the staff (a post-grad tutor). Things might have changed
for the better even in the last decade: for the past few years our intakes
of trainees at work (mostly maths or physics honours grads) have been about
50/50.

Shifting to the discussion of Yau's stripper monologue, I'm not so sure
that I'd dismiss it out of hand as being just "what men think women think".
Although I'm on shaky ground even discussing this, might it be possible
that the gulf between a woman who works in the sex industry and one who
doesn't is at least as wide as that between men and women in general? Where
Yau's monologue seems unrealistic is in its language rather than in its
content: my female friends who put on low cut tops and go out to trashy
bars to see what they can pull wouldn't use terms like "cornstalk smile" or
"smooth as a wave", but otherwise their thoughts (or at least, the way that
they present their thoughts to their male friends) seem not too different.

Again, I may be way off base here too. A female friend of mine (_not_ one
of those who go to sleazy bars, I must add, except for research purposes)
had a story published a couple of years ago called "Striptease: or the
butterfly, this other species", and from what I remember the female
protagonist wasn't too far off Yau's. The combination of fierce pride in
the powers of her body with total contempt for the subhuman punters seems
very similar. I should re-read it. Can anyone suggest a female writer who
writes of her own experiences in the sex industry? Annie Sprinkle? Raewyn
Alexander? Xaviera Hollander?!?? And which if any of the many filmic
presentations of the industry seems realistic and/or productive? "Exotica"?
"Mona Lisa"? "Whore"?


Tentatively,

        Tom Beard.

Writing.out


Nikuko says she doesn't speak so much as try words out. And not just
words, or not primarily words, but words in sequences, seeing if they
fit together. There's always a question associated with her voice as
it's written - her voice which is an inference or a dreaming. What is
cyberspace. It is a dreaming. What kind of dreaming. The kind where
there appear to be dominions and grids, always expanding, intersecting
- who knows whether or not they're regular. You can see the fine
wires. Nikuko says she doesn't mean fiber optic at all, she's talking
about the wires laying across the ground as if they were attached to
guided missiles. Someone wears goggles, Jennifer adds, and then she
can see where the missile goes. You can see through the front-end
television. The target gets closer and closer; you might imagine the
pores of the skin and then, nothing. After the explosion, wires re-
mained criss-crossing the desert. That's the kind of dream cyberspace
is, says Nikuko, just exactly.

In that, there are words which are targets, you can imagine the mis-
sile heading towards _hunger._ It lands somewhere between the _u_ and
_n_, she says, think of it as

                    ||
                    ||
                    ||
                    ||
                  hu||nger

breaking it in two, its connection with organism. Then there's no more
hunger, Jennifer asks playfully? No, there's no more hunger, that is
surely the truth, Nikuko "says." She has tried the word on, seen it
fit to wear, to fail, to fall, to fulfill. She has tried it on, shot
it down. In a dream, the word has appeared; it was at the bottom of a
deep valley, in the midst of a deeper ocean. It was blank ink in dark-
blue water, and as she watched it, it dissipated, and then later,
there was a thread about it on an email list, and that was in her
dream as well - writing a response to the list, cc: ing it to her con-
scious - and here, Jennifer began to think, she was at last coming to
grips with it, writing her hunger out.

How would the different poets and critics here like to die?

I would like to die like a certain semiotician who was hit one week by a
mail truck while reading current philology. A week or so after
recouperating, a laundry truck finished the job. I believe the 2nd book
was by Vendler which stuck the reader as hilarious shortly before the
laundry man, Pierre, went down in history.

be well

If I am to die, I want to die as a well-dressed poet... but perhaps it is
because I just saw this amazing film directed, written, and staring Yukio
Mishima. It is basically a stylized setting for his future suicide.
Mishima took death as an art form.

Tosh,

what's the name of the film? The only one I've seen
starred Ken Ogata ("Mishima") which was also
highly stylised and combined theatre and film.

Best,

Tom:

Excuse my butting in here, but there's a heck of a lot of stuff published
about Susan Howe, if that's what you want. I think the best essays are still
those by George Butterick (North Dakota Quarterly 55, Fall 1987) Rachel Blau
DuPlessis ("Whowe", Sulfur 20, Fall 1987) and Marjorie Perloff (in, hmmm,
_Poetic License_ 297-310). There's also a pretty good one by Gregory Dale
Adamson in the Michel Serres issue of _Sub/Stance_ 83: 1997 ("Serres
Translates Howe"); and I should also (of course!) mention my own essay in
_Disjunctive Poetics: From Gertrude Stein and Louis Zukofsky to Susan Howe_
(Cambridge UP 1992).

John Taggart has a pretty good essay too, somewhere, but I can't remember where.

Obviously the best entry to her work is her work. But read the first chapter
of her brilliant prose book _The birthmark: Unsettling the wilderness in
American literature_ -- or her more celebrated _My Emily Dickinson_.

Reading John Shoptaw's "The Music of Construction - Measure and Polyphony
in Ashbery and Bernstein" (in The Tribe of John) I'm just wondering who
else has used these units of prosodic measurement - character, word,
line, phrase, sentence, section. I'm aware of Silliman's use of
sentence but not much else.

The idea of Yeats as a counter-exemplar to Pound is not anachronistic per
se.  American experiment from Pound to Stein to Zukofsky to Howe etc. has
had a lot invested in the "disjunctive", as P. Quartermain's book title
emphasizes.  While Yeats is no more attractive than Pound on a political
level, on an artistic level there is a clear alternative path.  Both Pound
& Yeats were trained or self-taught in both visual art & music; but they
went in different directions with it.  Pound's fascination with the image
led a poetics of disjunction; Yeats moved toward synthesis - a synthesis of
word, rhythm, and image.  That approach is by no means played out, despite
the experimental tribe's ideological attachment to disjunction as the
insignia of political resistance & philosophical savoir-faire.

Mebbe.....But the point is, you really have ta work at the reply (as it
was repeated on the List, certainly) to create on behalf of HM a good,
well-intentioned "meaning."  In the context of my original questions and
concerns (which were *political* quite specifically, indeed: offensively
P.C. i hope..) about the staggeringly stag character of the O'o, the
hopscotch line didn't seem to get us much of anywhere...

But he wasn't answering my question (quite); so no doubt i was being
unfair.  If it had been me in HM's shoes, i would have addressed the whole
gender issue directly, even tho' the question was couched in terms of
women and math, because i think gender-politix issues are crucial
everywhere in our lives.  But admittedly HM is not me (poor guy) and i
wasn't there.  But that's the source of my sounding overly impatient about
the hopscotch comment.  (an impatience i still think is pretty
appropriate.)

politically correctishly,

One clarification: what I meant to ask was who else (than Shoptaw) has used
these measures in the context of discussing prosody, i.e. in a "critical"
text. (Not of course which poets have used them in writing poetry.)

Just a thought for those asking about poetics programs etc which I thought
I'd share since it may not occur to others: Penn's Ph.D. program in
English  has been a damn good place for me to be as a poet.  With Bob
Perelman a tenured member of the faculty and with the perpetually active
Writers House bringing in many writers dear to this list (Silliman,
Hejinian, Bernstein, Lauterbach, Waldrop, Mackey and seemingly a zillion
others since I've been here) its become, I think an ideal place to work on
contemporary poetics (there are other fine professors working on poetics
generally who can discuss more or less everything up to and including the
1st generation New American Poetry, and Al Filreis is as schooled in his
own way in the current scene as Bob P is).  So, if you're thinking
PHDeees, Penn might be something to look into.  It's not a poetics program
per se but I've essentially turned it into one for myself as have other
members of this list like Louis Cabri & Matt Hart.      -m.

I must say: the discussion on Spielberg seems way out of line for the
list.
Not that I'm suggesting a censor --or trying to stop the discussion--but
the man as an artist isn't! He rewrites history in a clumsy albeit
monetary way--see Schindler's List--see that he is in the habit of
recreating a Heroic mythology--a cartoon strip--and has been quoted as
saying that "the great war movies of the 40's inspired (him)" Let's see

a film about a shark (which he had to be pushed into doing)
a film about an alien (a boyhood idea stolen really from Geroge Lucas)
another film about aliens (WOW!)
a film about the ATlantic Slave Trade (he was SUED for this one!)
a film
                        a film
                                                a film?

WHOOPS--I meant "movie"!

Spillberg (no typo) HAS destroyed the film industry--he won that war!
The great films of the 60s and 70s he single handedly destroyed when he
found out he couldn't make one! (No "humanity" or "personality" in his
films! Read RAGING BULLS and EASY RIDERS! His first film was THE
SUGERLAND EXPRESS--trying to be Altman, trying to be Scorsessem etc!) He
was raised on TV for god's sake!  The big MACHINERY he p[roduced--the
studio he saved (UNIVERSAL) they both overtook the great films of Hal
Asbhy (Harold and Maude, Shampoo, etc--films that made money!), Altman,
Scorsesee(his great films hardly were released! Yup--Taxi Driver did not
make the man wealthy!) Even Coppola (and left him a rather commercial
idiot I maight say--from Godfather and Apocylypse NOW (a GREAT "war"
movie--a movie that took a war into the lens--to "Jack" and
.........)

Phew.

Hey..I guess this is fun!

Back to the poem.........


What about poetic Heroes anyway--like Spicer?

Oh Henry!

What is this silly little black and white thing about Yeats contra
Pound, as if that is really the point anymore?

Such silliness is as vulgar as the anti-reference stuff during
Langpo's youthful, heroic days.

Who doesn't think Yeats was a great poet? And Mandelstam, who in
your hands has become something like a stick you pretend is a sword--
yes, alright already. He is a great poet and no one ever said he
wasn't.

Stevens is very "synthetic" but also quite conceptually
"disjunctive," not in the Yeats "alternate path" at all, eventhough
he loved the symbolists too.

Christopher Smart's "Jubilate Agno" is a thoroughly paratactic poem
that is deeply moving and overflowing with spirit. God dictated it.

Renga is a centuries old tradition which continues, into the present,
to be at service of a refined and "non-logical" exploration of
emotional and perceptual dimensions. Word, rhythm, and image, as you
put it, can be fused in this poetry in ways Yeats would have died
for.

(come to think of it, what, more exactly, do you mean by "synthetic"?
In what way can you argue that Pound did not "move toward a synthesis
of word, rhythm, and image"? Really, Henry, it's like you're just
throwing words around because you think you are a bull. Here, at
least _so far_, the word 'synthetic' is just a pile of you know
what.)

Celan doesn't make any sense like Yeats and those of his "path," but
he makes people weep.

Have you read the work of Donald Revell, C.D. Wright, or Duncan
McNaughton? These three contemporaries, off the top and among many,
are disjunctive as all get out, but their emotional and musical and
intellectual complexity is far beyond what you or I can manage.

And so on...

In fact, what about that Jennifer Moxley you wrote a review on? You
were so enthralled you couldn't even bring yourself to explain what
it was that was so great about her work. I don't know her work well,
but I know it's really quite "disjunctive." My point is that you
apparently found "disjunctiveness" in this case to be one path into
the poetic values you have been so insistently trying to instruct the
list about.

Why is Pound "the path" the "disjunctive" poets have followed? Some
have followed Dickinson just as much as Pound. That poet is
really weird, and she wasn't even into Theosophy. Whitman was really
weird too. Sometimes it was like one thought just didn't connect to
another.

Oh Henry. There is strong poetry and there is not-so-strong poetry
and there is fake poetry and so on. But value has little to do with
syntax or form. Some smart things you've said that I've seen point to
this truth, but often you sound like someone who just got kicked
out of the MA program at SUNY-Buffalo and is really pissed.

In good humor,
Captain Miller

thanks to all those who responded with suggestions on susan howe
criticism.  and yes, i did start with some of the primary texts but felt,
more so than with other quote-unquote difficult texts, that i was more or
less missing the boat.

would be interested to others' take on criticism as an heuristic.  e.g.
the first coolidge book i ever got was solution passage which on first
glance left me largely disinterested.  but upon some of watten's essays
in total syntax, plus a good look at as much of the early stuff as i could
find, solution passage became a whole new world...

This may just be my beef, but I get a little annoyed with anyone who has
an MFA, MA, PHd in poetry (of whatever version) claiming to be "outside
the academy." I, for one, believe this is a dated notion that no longer
applies. Experimental writers ARE in the "academy." Susan Howe at
Buffalo, Nathaniel Mackey at Santa Cruz, Myung Mi Kim at San Francisco
State, Bob Perelman at U Penn, and etc. and etc.

So you wanna be in the "academy"? Can't say that I would necessary
"recommend" San Francisco State University's MFA (having gotten it
myself) but it's worth checking out for those who want the
degree/experience. Besides the aforementioned Myung, Bob Gluck is a new
tenure track professor there starting this fall (after having taught
part-time for eons, but that's another story, actually not, it has to do
with opposing political forces in the dept.). Aaron Shurin has taught
part-time for quite a while also. And Maxine Chernoff is a good new
leadership force as chair of the dept. (We couldda used her while I was
there!)

One HUGE caveat: SFSU has no money for fellowships, so either be
prepared to work a lot (SF being a notoriously expensive place to live)
or be wealthy. Both types, the working & the wealthy, co-mingle there.
Plus SF is home to great writing community. Sure we're a little cranky,
and a whole lot gossipy, but we've got energy! We've got readings! We've
got magazines! All in all, there's enough to love.

There is in fact a comprehensive list, put out by the AWP
called . . .  called . . ._the AWP Guide to Writing Programs_ --
Though they probably don't list "poetics" among their genres, some
reading between the lines may prove illuminating and will certainly
get you a list of all MFA/PhD's with a focus on writing, who teaches
there, what special programs or perks they offer . . .

I'm also available for personal e-consultations.  I've done extensive
research over the past few years.  Did you know that UNLV GIVES their
students money to leave Las Vegas & go abroad?  Did you know that
Jorie Graham lives on a ranch in North Dakota and they heli-port her
in for office hours?  Did you know that Kathleen Fraser will be
teaching a course on mixed-genre type "poetry" at the New College
this fall?  Did you know that Derek Walcott often takes his entire
workshop out for lunch ON HIM (literally!! lookout girls!)?
I'll tell you which schools accepted me, which rejected (don't bother
with those losers!) and on what terms.

BEEHIVE is definitely worth checking out for those of us who know
nothing or something about hypertext.  I got lost (or did I wander?)
for hours in CAROLYN GUERTIN's super piece QUEEN BEES AND
THE HUM OF THE HIVE.  As well as dancing beautifully and graphically
with the hive metaphor, it traces lineages to hypertext pioneers, esp. to QUEEN BEES
(women), across borders and into Canada (or into the US?) and with
femininst and postmodernist theories .  It's loaded with info, texts & links
(both Canadian and American).  A few of Guertin's essays have interesting
analogues to the recent postfeminist thread on POETICS.
See esp "Breaking Down Walls: experimental women's fiction" and
"Honeycombing: open forms in hypertext and women's writing"

Date :  30/07/98
A :     kwtuma@miamiu.acs.muohio.edu (Keith Tuma)

Felt a leap in spirit when I read Keith Tuma's fascinating report on this
London conference a day ago.  There have been several signs recently that the
old friendly and knowledgeable relationship between British and US non-
mainstream writing -- the one I'd known in my earlier days -- is in process of
revival.  As I dislike poetic nationalisms, even British ones, this delights
me.

Bit of history.  When I lived in New York for nearly five years in 1987-8/92,
apart from Tom Raworth, I couldn't have been asked about all other British
poets more than six times altogether.  Round about then, Greg Masters lent me
Hugh Kenner's "The Sinking Island", an analysis of why British poetry had gone
down the tubes . . . except for a few poets who had been influenced by the
Americans.  Since I've always had close friendships with US poets I'd do my
best to spread more news.  Even when helping to sum up a St Mark's symposium
where Amiri Baraka had trounced not just the European-based literary
syllabuses in the American academy but also British literature in particular
(it's all Irish), I didn't go hostile because I can well see the necessities
out of which he was speaking.

Helen Vendler and Edna Longley are perhaps easy targets, since they seem
generally hostile to the experimental as this list might think of it.
However, Vendler's reported belief that, before Mark Ford, Britain has had no
good poet since WWII would reinforce my point that it's easier for Americans
to appreciate Brit poets who have been strongly influenced by Americans
(apparently Ford by Ashbery -- I don't know Ford's work). As for Ireland,
didn't Oxford prof John Bayley declare in the Times or the NY Review of books
about 1990 that the only good poetry currently being written in our isles was,
indeed, Irish?  Since I haven't myself gone the way of cloning my poetry off
the States, I could get accosted after a reading in SF and asked, "Why is your
poetry so Eurocentric?"  "Because I live in Europe?"

During the 80s and early 90s Britain had become a difficult country to write
from (even if, like me, you lived abroad).  One slight ray in the
transatlantic darkness came with a Charles Bernstein article in Sulfur, where
Charles went to Britain and sort of "rediscovered" us -- at least, he mainly
rediscovered the poets closest to the language schools.  So be it. For us who
had been toiling away, it was rather like Louise Bennett's old phrase,
"Colonisation in reverse".  But it was a useful start.  Recent transatlantic
conferences like the one Keith has reported are another flicker of awakening,
especially if they keep their terms of reference generous and avoid coterie.

At the conf., Peter Barry asked for a pedagogically-friendly anthology of
experimental British poetry.  May I appeal to readers of this list to check
out the introduction by Ric Caddel and Peter Quartermain to their new
anthology, "Other British and Irish Poetry Since 1970" shortly to appear from
Wesleyan?   No one has yet been able to inspect the contents, but the book
shows every hope of answering at least part of Peter Barry's requirements.

"Other", as I fondly call it, has already been cited on the Buffalo list: I'd
like to re-emphasise that it's the first anthology of British and Irish
experimental writing to be published in the States for decades. The
introduction presents a particular view of British experimental poetry, one
that I've already said I don't always agree with:  but there's lots to chew
on; and it is unremittingly intelligent.  It's on John Tranter's Jacket mag
webp at:

 http://www.jacket.zip.com.au/jacket04/otherbrit.html

Can we now look forward to more of this genuine dialogue, US-British?  I mean,
just check out authors like Denise Riley, Allen Fisher, Bill Griffiths, Andrew
Duncan, Grace Lake, Helen Macdonald, the Londoners, the Northerners, the Scots
and Irish, the austere Mr Prynne, the Cambridge Circus, Rod Menghem's
praiseworthy Equipage enterprises, Nicholas Johnson's Etruscan Readers, Ken
Edwards Reality Street press, Lawrence Upton and the Subvoicive series in
London, sparky Glasgow, the signifying North of England, Ireland's buried
experimenters!  There's very little spare cash in Britain for readings and
almost none for the kinds of grants poets pick up in the States -- much more
difficult to mount activities -- but there's a very sharp energy.

Also, Britain is newly receptive to American poetry as a recent conference I
attended in Exmouth, Devon, made obvious to me.  The younger writers on both
sides are fast coming up.  The time is ripe.  Any suggestions for more
contact, more mutual spreading of knowledge?  Any comments about US
perceptions of the current state of British poetry.

I would never make light of the decision to participate in WW2. I don't think
that stopping Hitler was optional.

But having seen the photos my own father took in Nagasaki one month after the
bombing there (though never having spoken with him about this),

And thinking not just of Lowell, but of Creeley choosing to drive an ambulance
in Burma, and of Whalen, Rexroth and others in the C.O. camp in Oregon, it
certainly does seem that it was possible to step back and decide, for
perfectly good reason, to say no. None of these people (not even Lowell) was
an idiot.

Oh Kent!  Thanks for waking me up this jelly-beaned Friday morning!
Sure, disjunction isn't bad in itself... can't have poetry without
leaps.  But sometimes the simple observation isn't necessarily
vulgar.  There's a book out there [forget title as usual] that
frames 20th-century modernism as the discovery of disjunction on
many levels.  Probably lots of books on that.  But we're talking trends.
Trends don't last forever.  Open up any magazine advertised on this list.
You will find poems made up of inchoate jumbles of broken syntax. I
call this obscurity in a negative sense.  By synthesis I mean the
combination of syntactic rhythm - beautiful in itself ["good prose",
as Ez put it in his early days] - the rhythm of sentences, phrases,
lines - with imagery: concrete, conceptual.  "Song" is a synthesis of
music and vision. I don't think you can disagree that synthesis so defined,
on both an artistic & an ideological level, has been devalued by the
postmodernist/experimental movements in poetry.

I repeat, I'm not against disjunctive leaps per se.  I'm just having fun
suggesting that there are alternatives to the alternative, there are
counters- to the counter-.  In fact when I sent the message I was thinking
of some of the Moxley I had read (in the Tender Buttons book) as an example
of the counter-counter tendency toward complete sentences and synthetic
structure.

I think syntax has a lot to do with the pleasure & beauty of poetry.

Absolutely right, Tom.  I'm just reminding the list that there ARE 2 sides.

The /AWP Guide/ does indeed list those things, but precious few PhD
programs, many more MA/MFA--and one does have to do a good bit of reading
between the lines to determine what congenial or gnarly attributes each
program "really" has.

(North Dakota? I thought the former Marjorie Pepper lived in Tie Siding,
Wyoming when not in Iowa class, and I remember that only because I liked
the name Tie Siding.)

pls add me to the list of those interested--I am actively seeking a good
phud program in which to turn an idee fixe into a dissertation.

   Thanks, Karen Kelley, for your reponse....Well, spilling it (or
   stripping it--since strippers are artists), I have many responses--
   only some of which I can touch on here. One would be to ask you how
   YOU would represent what goes on in the mind of a stripper (or
   to direct me to work of yours that deals with this)....
   Another response would be to agree with you (up to a point):
   Let's say that--in the particular passages you quote--that Yau
   is probably closer to what men think women are than to the
   actuality of a woman who may strip her clothes but yet not
   "Spill it" (her mind). But, if you look at the entire book
   (in which there are a variety of female characters, some as "I"
   and some as "she"), or even if you look at this particular piece
   in question IN ITS ENTIRETY, you might find that at least Yau is
   self-conscious (and meta) enough to admit this possibility (even
   the choice of title of the book, MY SYMPTOMS, calls attention to
   the possibility that the female speaker is a "masked male" etc...
   (a la Shakespeare)....
   I wonder if women who represent male characters in ways that might
   seem "stereotypical" or "derogatory" (or "positively" even) have the
   same problem (I'm not saying that I don't like reading such writing
   by the way: I learn much from it). Certainly not every woman writer
   is as extreme as Jane Austen who never had a scene in which two male
   characters appear without any women in the the scene (because she
   only wrote "what she knew"), nor am I suggesting they should do so....

   I don't know enough about how dancers are "stereotyped" to comment
   on whether Yau is, in fact, doing it. In my experience (admittedly
   little) with strippers, the "stereotype about strippers" is "we only
   do it for the money. We get little or no intrinsic thrill out of
   exhibitionism, and we certainly see it more as humiliation than as
   any kind of 'grrrl power' over men." And in this particular story
   (which is good, but not--in my opinion, one of the best pieces in
    MY SYMPTOMS--I say this by way of "sales pitch" I guess), Yau goes
   very much against THAT stereotype, and yet elsewhere in MY SYMPTOMS
   he sympathetically portrays a woman who "had been a model, it was
   her boyfriend's idea. He brought her to New York when she was 17
   and finally pushed her up the stairs the agency, even though she had
   been crying non-stop for two days."(120). So, I think we see a range
   here of attitudes towards female exhibitionism rather than an AGENDA
   proferring "proper" female roles. And if both these characters--
   taken alone--may run the risk of becoming "stereotypes," I believe
   that by offering a range, these "stereotypes" cancel each other out
   (again, like Shakespeare presenting both a Beatrice and a Hero in
    the same play for instance--so the "truth" can be somewhere "in
   between" for a wider range of readers...)...

   Besides, you take OUT OF CONTEXT a few quotes that all occur near
   the beginning (in the first 2 pages) of an 8 page story. In "Butcher,
   Baker..." the woman is only a stripper for the first two pages. Later
   on, the woman character, an EX-stripper, single-mother, is expressing
   her attraction to firemen, and raises all these doubts about her
   motivations: "i don't know why I have this thing about firemen, but
   I do...maybe it's because I think in metaphors and I should learn to
   think some other way..." (Yau himself a metaphorical thinker, going
   against the traditional anti-metaphorical prejudice that linked
   metaphor and women, in Locke, in Renaissance Rhetoricians like
   Puttenham, etc., though nowadays some claim it's a feminist argument
   to argue AGAINST metaphor....blah blah).
   Now, I see what happens here as an inversion of an "archetypal"
   stereotype here....the traditional linkage of women with water
   and men with fire (as in LYSISTRATA, another man putting words in
   the mouth of a woman, or in Jagger's "She's So Cold" for instance)
   and then, and I think this also goes beyond stereotype, the female
   character starts expressing a desire for a FIREWOMAN. There's both
   an unstereotypical lesbian dimension here, as well a desire on the
   character's part to BECOME a firewoman ("a woman who fights fires.
   They have to give her her due and treat her like a man. She's on
   the line with them..."),
   so this woman character tries on quite a few "non-traditional" roles
   in the course of this piece. This piece is --on one level--about
   whether identity is contingent not only on gender (or sex), but also
   one ones choice of profession (a la Harryman). And I am curious what
   you, Karen kelley, have to say about this (though I do not grant Mark
   Weiss the authority I grant you in this matter, since I am more
   suspicious of a male judging another male as sexist,) and I have more
   to say on this (but will save it for the longish essay I want to
   write on this book--if I can find a publisher who will make room
   for my logorrhea), but wanted to express some of these points here
   in this forum, in the interest of dialogue....
    Again, thanks, for responding.......

    Thanks Ron Silliman--I didn't mean to "make light" of it either
    with my reference to Lowell....
    I am definitely aware of speaking as one who was "socialized"
    by a vietnam-era anti-war attitude.....
    yet to what extent america helped create (fertile ground for)
   Hitler (humiliation of germany after ww1,"our own" fledgling
    imperial desires, the support then given germany as against
    communism, etc. etc.) would probably need to be addressed--
    (and by one with the pull of spielberg!)

Er, who precisely makes this claim, who has a degree??  any of these folks
(Howe, Mackey, etc...?) They do indeed teach, and i don't know as i have
ever heard/read any of 'em claim to be "outside the academy"...

Of course, some of us are, in many important senses.  (OK i am clerical
support-staff at a university, but like most support-staff, i'm way
outside the academics that go on there..This just for clarification..Since
i have no graduate degrees i realize the above couldn't have been aimed at
me, even if you knew me from adam, which i suspect you don't...)

Whence this little tirade??

No!!  The Potes & Poets anthology Floating Capital : New Poets from London
(1991) is superb.

And there was a special fat issue of New American Writing, which (despite
the mag's title) was a similar anthology of non-mainstream Brits.  It
isn't in my humble opinion as good as Floating Capital, but it is good.
(Came out 1989-1992, somewhere in there...)

well--I hold an MA in Poetics--have taught at the Community College
level--and at the Otis Art Institutte--then made a shift to middle
school (7th grade) and certainly am "outside" both the academy and much
else. It is possible to hold those degrees and not join up. I would add,
too, that "outside" don't mean much--BUT--that often the "academy" has
focused on poets and poetics that don't address what is being read or
written by "innovative" (er, experimental?) er--poets.

a shock, Dickinson scared them--and Ashbery, O'Hara, Spicer--Hejinian,
Scalapino--etc...were all revelations--and I was one of 5 teachers who
focused on literature and poetry!  I have friends who teach inside the
"academy walls"--and they do amazing work--but each and everyone say it
is a struggle to persuade dept. heads to change coursework..to have
readings..to get work done that follows the course of late-20th century
poetics! Imagine that problem in an art dept.!

KATHY:

ps: one reason--to be addressed I hope--that many of the poets you
mention are inside the academy--is work. Plain and simple. I know they
are great teachers--but boy did they spend years fighting to get in--and
they/we all need the damn steadiness of the work. I chose to teach
Middle School becauseI love kids--and the steady check--my summers off
simply allow me to remind myself how much joy there is in the serios
work of a poet--but that--hereabouts--frightens my 40 year old mind and
body--and no-one I know who writes can really afford not to work at all.
Tho--of course--there are some--and they teach out of the joy and
conflict teaching allows.

What would happen tho if all these poets--if all these writers--had the
choice to collect their checks and not teach? Many would stay where they
are--they are often doing the amazing work of keeping students readings
and thinking! The academy ain't evil--but it does have an evil face!

                Ron, Creeley, with only one eye, would not have qualified
for the army. I believe he joined the ambulance corps as the next best
thing he could do to take part in the war. Your list today seems to lump
him together with C.O.s.

For those who want to read about Susan Howe, I'd like to add to Peter
Quartermain's list my own article, published in Magill's Literary
Ecnyclopedia, which category and issue I dont now recall, but there'll be
an index.

Vtw, speaking of Silliman and Literary Ebcyclopediae, Volume 29 of the Gale
Research Autobiography Series has a wonderful piece done by Ron, in a
volume that also contains good articles by Ann Ericksaon and Gerald Rosen
and Stephen Sandy.

Thanks for many helpful backchannel tips on what poets have used prosodic
measures such as the charecter, word, phrase, etc. But again, I ws hoping
to hear about _critical/ theoretical_ texts in which such measures are
introduced/ used/ discussed. Or where prosody or the poem's soundscape is
discussed in terms of syntax, grammar, instead of meter or phonology.

:: Reading John Shoptaw's "The Music of Construction - Measure and Polyphony

This is germane to the interesting reflections by Bruce Andrews (somewhere
in Paradise and Method), about the disparity he found, in the mid-,
late-sixties, when starting out as a poet, between how much modernism "the
establishment" accepted and understood in classical music, painting,
dance, film, jazz, etc. and how much modernism was accepted or understood
in the world of poetry (i.e., zilch).  Leading him to look to other arts
primarily for contemporary inspiration and example...

        Being an "academic poet" has little to do with having an
academic address and the notion of an academic art arose long
before poets were notably teaching in universities.

In "Composition as Explanation" (1926), Gertrude Stein wrote:

"Lord Grey remarked that when the generals before the war talked
about the war they talked about it as a nineteenth-century war
although to be fought with twenieth-century weapons.  That is
because war is a thing that decides how it is to be done when it
is to be done.  It is prepared and to that degree IT IS LIKE ALL
ACADEMIES it is not a thing made it is a thing prepared.Writing
and painting and all that, for those who occupy themselves
with it  and don't make it as it is made."

In some sense most poetry and art are academic; it has nothing to
do with whether its can be stylistically identified as "avant-garde"
or "traditional."  The Workshops at St. Mark's may in this sense be
as academic as the Iowa Writer's Workshop.

i feel even slightly so silly saying this but "being an academic" is
more a frame of mind than a matter of degrees.  Sometimes I sigh and
say "so I'm an academic poet" (MFA, forthcoming PhD) -- but I
absolutely AM NOT. "Academic" rings to me of "New Critical" --
viewing a certain set or relations between the establishement and
poetry (establishment -- academic journals, first book prizes, homage
to Laureate type gods and goddesses -- that whole rap).
Perhaps todd hit it on the head:
> It is possible to hold those degrees and not join up. I would add,

The Question to Ask Now is:  has bringing "innovative" poetics, poets
and poetries into the academy -- _taking_ the there (and off the
streets?) --  MADE them academic/exclusive/closed/deadened them
somehow?  I wonder what people think?  Personally, it's made it a
possibility -- though I had to sit out many years with Academic
academics until I got wind of the innovative ones -- but that now has
changed; many "entering" the academy -- undergrads thinking of
going on, as recent postings in this thread prove, know what's there.

I do not wish to get involved with the inside/outside the academy argument,
but I can say that, for me, getting an MFA was invaluable.

I received my degree from Bard College.  At the time of my application, I had
lived in a small (>10,000) town in upstate New York for over ten years.  I
applied to Bard because a) I knew where it was and b) I respected Robert
Kelly.  I wanted to go to school, any school, because I was desperately sick
of my own writing and my own ignorance, and did not know how to fix either
one.

At Bard, I got to work with some really wonderful people.  At first, they just
gave me a lot to read, which was mind blowing.  It was beyond imaging what
poetry could do.  It blew the top of my head off.  Then they started taking my
writing apart, which was wonderful too.  I learn to think about writing in a
new way, and to acknowledge its enormity.

I have no idea why they admitted me to Bard.  My writing was terrible and I
knew nothing.  I do know that most of the people who go through that
particular MFA program feel their writing improves, no matter where they
started.

Of the people I keep track of, one is working in a liquor store, one lives in
New Orleans, one is a literacy coordinator & one lives at home. None of them
are employed as teachers.  They are all still writing.

If anything, getting an MFA has decreased my chances for material success in
this world.  When I go on job interviews, people either think I am
overqualified or under qualified.  While I was going to school, a lot of
people asked me what I was going to do with this degree, and I said that one
doesn't necessary do anything with it.  One might become a better writer.

A while back, there was a comment that people should use the money they spend
on school and go live in New York or San Francisco instead.  In some ways,
that is true.  I would have had a lot more exposure to different writings and
individuals.  I am a very shy person (for example, I have been on this list
for over 2 years, and this is my second post, I think). I don't think I would
have been able to talk to people about writing from just living in a city.  It
is possible now that I might be able to live in a city and talk to strangers,
but I couldn't then.

For me, meeting other people who really cared about writing, having a mixed
community of peers and teachers, having my writing improve and having poetry
and poetics become so much larger was well worth the cost of admission.

I think your reflections on this are highly interesting, Don...But i don't
believe Kathy's original point, or what most of us have been saying, is
about people being "academic poets."  Rather it's about a
*socioideological location*   Being an academic poet is another matter.
While Bob Gruman (inventor of "acadominant" as a label for langpots) and
other will disagree, i consider the *work* of Howe and Perelman and our
distinguished ListHoncho to be about as far from "academic poetry" as any
i've ever seen.  But they are the ones who've (correctly) been enumerated
as otherstream poets teaching in the academy...Now Chris has also pointed
out, in response to my challenge, that some of 'em are (or have been)
capable of dismissing other poets as "academics.."  Which i agree is very
interesting and enlightening indeed...

I'm working out a new theory about the jacket design of New Directions books.

Basically, I'm claiming that they are designed to look like they already smell
like cigarette smoke.  That way when they do smell that way, after years of
reading while smoking, no one is surprised.  A corollary of this theory then is
that smokers buy more New Directions books than non-smokers and that's why
Laughlin designed them this way.

Did Laughlin smoke?  (As if I didn't know!)

Hello Friends,

Because of a SCSI termination problem I've lost all of the files on my
computer.  Among other things - my eudora folder with various saved e-mail
from over the past four years, all of my e-mail addresses, and it also
zapped my regular address book.  Data recovery attempts have failed.  I
don't have a hard copy of anything and I didn't back up...  Yes, I was
cocky to think it wouldn't happen to me, and even I don't feel sorry for
myself.

Today a friend reinstalled a bunch of apps to get me up and running.  All I
can think about right now is that I would sure like to rebuild my address
book and e-mail list.

If you gave me your contact info in the past, please send it again.  Sorry
for this form letter (I am sending it to my various lists), but it seems
like the most efficient way to ask.

Aren't there more than two side?  Where are the sides exactly? Are they
the sides of the same coin. I would ask ask who side you are on, but I
know which one.  Modernism/Postmodernism are not "trends" -- they are the
air we breathe.  Anyone who says otherwise is itching for a fight.  I
don't know about Mandelstam, but Nabokov would be unreadable before
modernism, counting our interest in the abject and the hyperironic.  Of
course, some of us find him unreadable anyway.   And he was a crank so
perhaps there is yet another side to join.

Frank O'Hara also has some disciples in Japan, I believe:

I am not a sushi-chef, I am a noodle maker, why?
I think I would rather be a sushi-chef, but
I am not. For example, I go to my friend's restaurant,
he is making some nori, there is a sardine in it.

"Ano, sono sakana ga nan-desuka?" I ask him.
It needed something there, he explained. But I,
I am a noodle maker...

Hmmmmmm...GS seems to be more interested in the device he's employing (the
pithy but accusatory quote) than in direct expression of anthing in
particular (..such as, who he thinks Thompson's groovy dictum referes to,
among poets)....

I read Yeats now as a sort of bizarre oddball, rather than as a
high-modernist, an official role that sort of trapped him. In "a prayer
for old age" he wanted to eschew respectability in favor of madness. Is
Yeatsianism played out? Yes, to the extent he is identified with a
particular sort of aesthetic conservatism that has passed its prime. No,
if we read him somewhat differently. I love parts of Yeats and would not
oppose him to Pound completely. There are more than two sides--modernism
is more like a twelve or thirteen sided figure. To paraprhase Perloff,
Pound/Stevens/Stein/Yeats/Williams/Maiakovsky/Vallejo... whose period?

Exactly. What I notice is how academics of all stripes (like prisoners of
yore) must needs scramble always to the margins, those now fashionable
outposts. Those everywhere in the thickest of the thick of it claiming
they ain't. Reminds me of Walker Percy's image of the man on the crosstown
bus reading about alienation: he ain't no way so alienated as the
alienated man who can't even conceive of reading about alienation.

For the record: solidly clerical (library); MFA (mainstream); PhD (on the
edge of the backwash or, switching metaphors, neglected sibling to one of
the big poetics programs).

I have taken to identifying with Akaky Akakievich, academically so.

We're all academics. (Echo of Mai 68.)

My only suggestion is the obvious: get your hands on the British and
Irish books.  Unfortunately, this is often easier said than done from
this side of the Atlantic.

The best way to get the Irish "buried experiment" is through Billy
Mills' latest catalog, available at this address:

Alternative Irish Poetries Distribution List
c/o Billy Mills
37 Grosvenor Court
Templeville Road
Dublin 6W
Eire

If you just can't wait a minute longer, call:

Loads of good stuff, from the 30s to last week.

Hi Chris,

It's true, I've not read all of _My Symptoms_, and I didn't at all mean to dismiss the
book. The idea of the title suggesting a masked male is quite interesting.

You also note: "This piece is--on one level--about whether identity is contingent not only
on gender (or sex), but also on one's choice of profession."

We all choose & choose not to buy into our socially constructed gender identities, and
choose & choose not to buy into our identities as contingent upon our professions. I've
done/been lots of things, but try not to get too attached: overidentifying myself as a
*poet* is as irritating to me as overidentifying myself as an ex-stripper. Interestingly,
though, the stripper portion of my experience, which took up only 2 years of my 40, is the
one that people focus on most & draw the largest number of conclusions about. The fact that
I taught adult ed during that same time is, apparently, neither here nor there. The fact
that I was a dancer is a strange demerit mark, dark & irreversible.

I got a tattoo when I was 17: back then, it was viewed by  peers & parents as something
irrevocable, signifying wantonness (esp. for a woman) & transgression. Getting a bachelors
degree during that time, by contrast, was socially transparent. It was okay for me to be
college-educated, and it even faded the intensity of the tattoo.

Now, of course, tattoos come & go with the swipe of a laser & are even trendy, so the
tattoo has turned into something else again.

Dancing, while *in part* a survival move in the transition from housewife to divorced
single-parent-with-no-child-support & degrees in sculpture & writing (contemplate *that*
earning power), was also a fascinating experience in what I could absorb identity-wise. I
suspect it is something that will *not* fade socially, as the tattoo did. It's an
experience I still haven't fully digested, and perhaps will never be able to, but I am
reluctant to over-intellectualize it, because I don't want to tidily categorize my own
experience.

I've written about dancing once, as portion of a larger poem & include it (since our
subject *is* , after all, immodesty):


_That’s me, displaying._

movable dream lab.

inside the lid: something long buried: subdued light, carpeted floors, stairs, bird beak, a

couch of some kind, forgotten books, stones, dirt, water, beautiful illegible scribbles,
voices down the hall narrating as if a whole new continent I have been listening to all my
life passing under the roof of my mouth, inwards.

 _during her time on stage
 green envelops her, at other times
 other hues, notably deep blue._
 wedding rings and husbands
 and wives rise urgently,
 sometimes turning into a cry.
 _I work with a small stash of
 movements and gestures, the
 meaning of which is fluid._
 there are several other styles of walking
 which accentuate gait or pace. a
 suggestive movement pierces through
 the relatively smooth surface.
 at this moment she is low
 on the ground. the deceptive nature
of the dance glides slowly towards
shape—is it an arm or wing?--that
comes down from the ceiling
and fits into her chest.
the shape now appears to be one
 hand pointing downward to
 great advantage when she takes off
 an article of clothing in front of
 spectators. the actions of dressing
and undressing are far from natural,
a facet of the teasing process—now
you see me, now you don’t. just
before the show ends and you think
you might have got it, the beautiful
dress has come off some time before.

I am alone. Vast views and the feeling of being forever and ever alone. My secret hiding
places are woven around my body, shortcuts known only to me when I sink upon my
knees. _Stiletto_—is that a curse, is that a whisper? Eyes, mouth, breasts, hips, hands.
Nothing after that is denied me: birds freeze in midair and fall like stones to the ground.

And widow’s weeds, bridal veils, bassinets, memorial wreaths, trousers, whiskers,
wedding cakes, maps. My costume hides the fact, the great fact, the only fact. Faithless,
fickle, whore, deceiver. Now I have the queerest sensation in my thighs. There’s washing
and powdering and lies in my teeth like ghosts within me, a covey of swans, undulant and
florid. Somehow I still don’t know how I do it. The men’s faces are a thin gauze rising
and falling, turning like a slow arrow. _What’s in there?_ I have a variety of selves who
have forgotten my name, as happens when one wishes to be nothing but one self. Corners
of streets, bowls, bodies, windows and apples travel the immensely long tunnel of real
things. Pictures should somehow be suspended between you and me, between the
spectator and the dancer, equidistant from both. This promise is a glass of wine, an arm,
it changes, it shapes itself differently, the one I need most keeps aloof, I fling after my

name a little breath of crying and dancing. I see it falling and there it is, alone on the
stage as if my life does in fact run or hurry before me, picking out one particular thing,
the thing that matters, is it good, is it bad, is it right or wrong?

_I have looked upon the aesthetic as the ethical._

I waver about in an air of secrecy. The heels make my weight fall in different directions,
the looks over my shoulder help to stabilize my position. How nice it would be to marry a
man—oh no, that idea someone else invented, raising her hand to her brow—it is not so.
Instead of saying anything I turn, holding my stocking, and look at you.

Thankyou to all who have suggested programs, gives me something to think
about.

 In response to Linda Russo's Question...I'm about to begin my MA in
English this fall on Canadian sound poetry and I'm bursting at the seams
with excitement--excitement to be finally done with what the academy
considers necessary, which is (more often than not) "mainstream."  It's
not 'mainstreamedness' that I have minded, but the drab and absolutely
deadening, unvital way in which the mainstream folk are approached.
Fortunately, a little over halfway through my degree, with the help of a few
great profs here, I _did_ catch wind of the more innovative poets and from
then on studying and aspiring within an academic environment has become a
joy. Flakey-sounding perhaps, but I think what I think _now_ is that yes,
the mainstreamed folk cherished by the academy have been _ made_ dead by the
normal academic machinery (which is why, as my sessional friends teaching
English 101 tell me, when given the choice to skip the poetry unit
altogether most happily vote to do so); so given that they were all, at one
time, as innovative and "on the street"  (?) as the innovators of today, how
have I had such good luck? Maybe it's not only the rigid way in which
institutions have in the past approached poetry, but the poetry itself was
well-suited to being studied in an institutional setting (I'm thinking of
Eliot--is this unfair of me?).

 SO, maybe all this is to say that it's the rigidity of institutions that
makes them yucky and that does violence to the vital elasticity of a lot of
great art/poetry; and  since--as far as I know!--I'm "inside" academia and
been able to have enough room to do explore the margins, maybe the academic
environment is becoming more conducive to the study of innovative poetry/poetics
 and more flexible in its ranges of possible approaches.

Oh, my little tirade, I remember it well. . . I was thinking about the
fact that I no longer think it's historically accurate to say that
"experimental" poetry, or language poetry for that matter, is a project
"opposed" to the academy. It is opposed to traditional/conservative
forces within the academy that have dug their heals in, ready to defend
what(?) their position, what they see as a (their) "tradition." But most
often those folks are ahistorical themselves, not understanding the
longstanding traditions of what is called "experiment."

I weathered vicious "poetry wars" while a grad student at San Francisco
State, so am particularly aware of these factions. My point came up in
the context of someone (Todd B.?) recommending grad programs and then
saying that these were "outside of the academy" and this just does not
make sense. Certain programs may embrace more radicalizing traditions,
but that doesn't make them "outside" the "academy."

I agree with this point:

The current insider/outsider discussion re the academy recalls the
"poets vs. critics" thread (and yes, if memory serves, that was one of
the actual subject lines) played out on Poetics a year or two ago.
Perhaps the cyclical resurrection of the topic is invetiable given the
proximity (or, if you excuse the academically fashionable pluralization,
the multiple proximities) this list and many of its constituents bear
towards academic institutions. But still, the appearance of this topic
always depresses me for its unavoidable ressonance with broader strains
of public anti-intellectualism: the conservative attack on the
professoriate, media attacks on the "ivory tower" (what is the origin of
that epithet, anyway?).

(Nor are these topics of only "academic" interest given that the budgets
of public universities like SUNY Buffalo or the U. of Virginia (where I
am) are functions of state legislatures and public policy -- and thus,
in some ultimate sense, public opinion.)

Academic self-hatred of the kind sometimes seen here strikes me as a
nostalgic gesture, nostalgia for a time when academics could still
afford the luxury of their identity.

Indeed, there was a great artistic mutuality between Yeats and Pound to
the benefit of both, and to the reader. Pound had his egoistic fascism
and Yeats had his post-Raphaelite automatic writing and these and many
other differences surfaced e.g. over Joyce, over how to attack
middle-class values etc. But to understand the depth and quality of the
intellectual exchange, as well as mutual affection, just listen to Pound
from Pisa:

The Kakemono grows in a flat land out of mist
     sun rises lop-sided over the mountain
       so that I recalled the noise in the chimney
as it were the wind in the chimney
       but was in reality Uncle William
downstairs composing
that had made a great Peeeeacock
     in the proide ov his oiye
     had made a great Peeeeeeecock in the...
made a great peacock
     in the proide of his oyyee
     proide ov his oy-ee
     as indeed he had, and perdurable

     a great peacock aere perennius.

Yeats, the older poet, maintained the "I" ("eye" or "oy-ee") as the
fixed center of observation. Pound, through the sheer material ambitions
of his poetry culminating in the Cantos, shattered that assumption of
the center ("I cannot make it cohere") attributing the subsequent
fragmentation and dislocation as symptomatic of the modernist dilemma
but not of 'the world' itself. The reorganization of culture occurred
around the systems of quantification that elaborated or mimicked the
success of technological science-- an historical condition that had been
set in motion in the late Renaissance. Pound's modernism like all
poetry, even work operating in bounded randomness such as Cage's
composition, relies ultimately on its 'qualitates' not on any
statistical efficacy. The Cantos' huge and largely failed ambitions
opened the way for an understanding of the failure & fragmentation that
poetry has experienced in this century in its attempt to assert itself
in a world that largely dismisses it or requires a squeaky
sentimentality in tone, form, and content which, for its meager
existence, must contract to remain bereft of the critical capacity to
address culture's central paradigms of science and technology. (Please
excuse the sweeping generalizations and elisions that this form of
communication (e.g. email) demands.)---Carlo Parcelli

Dear Anthony and list,

The Mishima film was filmed in the mid or late 60's.  I can't remember the
name.  There's no dialogue or sound except for Wagner's music.  It is a
weird beautiful, odd, narcissistic film by Mishima himself.  It is about 20
minutes long, and basically it is based on his short story "Patriotism."

Mishima plays a soldier who has been dishonored, and therefore, along with
his wife, commits suicide, .  Basically a little warm up to his final
performance.'

After his death, Mishima's wife tried to destroy all prints, including the
negatives.  What I saw was pretty much a bootleg video - and the print
wasn't that hot.

So the film is sort of between Cocteau, Genet's prison film, and Kenneth Anger.

I've always thought of "academic" as a term denoting a certain form of
cultural entrenchment. As in: "the academy" functions as a sort of cultural
repository--and as such it is by definition conservative.

I have never understood the claim that "avant-garde" poets are in any way
less academic than "mainstream" poets. Both (ostensible) camps guard their
traditions and canons jealously... both harbor various means of garnering
prestige (mags, prizes--c'mon that the avant-garde doesn't have lots of
book prizes and awards...).... both maintain a capacity for dogma.


Best,
Katy

I'd join the academy if I could.
I'm tired of never having any money.
I'm tired of the stress always looking for the next little job.
I'm tired of being an outsider.
I'm tired of no health insurance book/travel/conference perks.
I'm tired of begging. I'm tired of insomnia.
I'm tired of no furniture, eating poorly.
I'm tired of the whole fucking thing.
I'd join in a second.
I'd join for free.

Worth remembering too, whatever one might think of it, that there
were a number of U.S. anti-Stalinist socialists (none of them idiots,
either) who followed in the tradition of Bill Haywood, Mother Jones,
and Eugene Debs, and said: This is a capitalist war; workers should
refuse to fight for the armed forces of capital and organize, through
the newly won unions, their own military contingents to fight
fascism.

Most of them went to jail under the Sedition Act. The
U.S. Communist Party (which had significant influence in the CIO)
publicly cheered, calling them Nazi agents.
