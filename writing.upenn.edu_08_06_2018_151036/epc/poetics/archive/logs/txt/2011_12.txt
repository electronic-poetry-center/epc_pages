Many thanks to Andrew Burke for driving/editing *Truck *so capably during

Dear All:

We (*quarter after*) are interested in art that pushes, or rather
forcefully shoves, the boundaries.  If your art exudes thought, we want
it.  We are looking for poetry, visual poetry, asemic writing, poetic
statements, visual art (in all of its glorious forms) and statements of
theory.  We strive to be a place for the thinking artist.

Please send all submissions to quarterafter@live.com.

The subject line of your submission should include the type of submission,
followed by the word =93submission=94 and your name (example: *Poetry
Submission: Calvin Pennix*).  Please include a brief bio in the body of the
submission=92s email, outlining what you=92re into and any previous
publications.
*Poetry/Visual Poetry/Asemic Writing/Art:*

Submit up to five (5) pieces as one (1) Word or pdf. file attached to the
email.   There is a wide range of opportunity here, so anything you feel
might fit send it over.

*Poetics Statements/Artists Statements/Theory Essays:*

Submit one (1) statement/essay at a time as one (1) Word or pdf. file
attached to the email.  Again, there is a wide range of opportunity here,
so anything you feel might fit send it over.

And remember, we are interested in art that pushes, or rather forcefully
shoves, the boundaries.  If your art exudes thought, we want it.  We strive
to be a place for the thinking artist.  If you didn=92t think about your wo=
rk
neither will we.

Again, please send all submissions to quarterafter@live.com.

We look forward to checking out your work!

*All the Best,*

*Calvin Pennix*

*Founding Editor, quarter after*

The Loft Bookshop
Twisted Pepper, 54 Middle Abbey St
Dublin 1, Ireland

Mount your hobby horse for the final wurm im apfel event of the year:
we're opening the mic to anyone who wants to conduct poetry
performance experiments: bring out your sound poems and your found
poems, your prose poems and your schmooze poems, your vispo and your
pisspo, your collaborations and your Resistance (but not blue paint.
Rob The Loft says no paint. Please don't bring paint, even if you are
going through a Blue Period.) We will have a visit from the Tongue Box
Exquisite Corpse, now housed in its very own collage reliquary; venite
et adoramus, for this is now likely to be the fattest and maggotiest
Cadaver in Ireland. We will have frolics with field recorders and a
Cut-up Contest.

Register your interest in performing at wurmimapfel@gmail.com, or just
show up on the night. Performances should be less than 7 minutes long,
or seem less than 7 minutes long.

(Please, no paint. I can't stress how important the no-paint thing is.)

Please share!

(edited from Adam Tobin at Unnameable Books)

Meanwhile, a ragtag gang of roving musicians has stumbled into our
basement, creating a space we never knew was there before, and making
sounds we'd like to hear again. This Sunday evening, for one, our very own
ALAN SONDHEIM plays the oud and pipa with EspDisk's CHRIS DIASPARRA on
baritone sax and JUDY of Caspar the Holy Ghost. WHAT? Improvised music.
They are amazing, and I'm not just saying that because I love them. They
start making music at 7pm on Sunday, and may they never stop.  That's
Sunday the 4th, at 8 pm.

Much love,
yours at Unnameable Books

It added more material, but (without my having done a comparison of the
contents) it seems to be pretty radically winnowed. I agree that a true
"Collected" is very much in order.

I though it'd be a good idea to start holding a free weekly contest in
which the winner (which I choose with the utmost prejudice) receives one
copy of a Furniture Press Books titles (to be chosen by yours truly each
week).

This week's contest is as follows:

Write (in no more than 50-100 words) about the relationship between
community/neighborhood sustainability and the practice of writing poetry.

As always, you may interpret as broadly as you wish.

This week's prize is

Old News by Ryan Eckes (plus a copy of the CD featuring a collaboration
between Ryan and Dan Yorty).

If you like to know more about the book and/or Ryan's poetics, please
read an excellent intereview at http://habenichtpress.com/?p=782 and here
at
http://starlightphiladelphiapoetry.blogspot.com/2011/07/feature-ryan-eckes-philadelphia-anthems.html
.

The deadline for entries is December 9 at midnight.

Good Luck!

Dear Ric,

I'm copying Ed Foster (publisher of Talisman House, Publishers, as well as =
editor-in-chief of Talisman magazine) who is planning on bringing out Burst=
s of Light: The Collected Later Poems of William Bronk this spring. This vo=
lume will complement Talisman House's edition of Life Supports: New and Col=
lected Poems of William Bronk, which came out after the North Point Press v=
olume was no longer available, and the Collected Later will include the wor=
k from the many volumes that were published post Life Supports (and I think=
 some poems that never made it into that earlier collected, but as I write =
this I'm  not sure about that  inclusion).

The appearance of Bursts of Light will coincide with a two-day symposium on=
 Bronk (organized by Ed and me, with crucial help from Peter Nicholls and M=
ichael Golston), which we are tentatively calling "William Bronk in New Yor=
k" and which will take place on April 13th (at NYU) and April 14th (at Colu=
mbia U) and will culminate on the 14th with a plenary keynote talk by Henry=
 Weinfield to be followed by a  large number of poets, critics and scholars=
 reading favorite Bronk poems to the gathering. We are planning to have the=
 entire conference audio- and video-recorded (ultimately the audio to be st=
reamed at PennSound and the video at the future Talisman website).

Until I finish teaching this semester I won't have the time ascertain if we=
 might still be able  to add a paper or two to the schedule we'll be workin=
g up (but if you're interested in presenting a paper then do send Ed and me=
 an abstract and we'll see if we can fit it in)-but, while we already have =
commitments from a number of people to come and read Bronk poems aloud on t=
he 14th we are still hoping more people, including you if you can come, wil=
l want to help us celebrate his work  by reading a bit of it to us all duri=
ng this closing ceremony (after which we'll head somewhere still to be dete=
rmined for drinks and talk).

I will be sending more information about "William Bronk in New York" along =
with, eventually, a full schedule of events, before too long.

I don't know if the Collected Later will be available prior to the conferen=
ce but of course it will be available for sale there.

Best wishes,

Burt

Subject: William Bronk Collected

Hi,
I was wondering if anyone knows of a 'complete' collected poems by William =
Bronk?
I know that North Point published Life Supports in 1982. I'm not sure if th=
e Talisman reissue of it in 1997 added any additional material. I can't get=
 a table of contents from Amazon to check.
I know that Bronk lived until 1999 and published many volumes after Life Su=
pports was released.

Thanks,
Ric

This is correct.  My experience indicates you ought to send galleys and a

=0A=0A~=0A=0A=0AAnd the obvious question is why does no one say that White =
folks are writing about =E2=80=9Crace=E2=80=9D when they write about themse=
lves? (No one except Toni Morrison in Playing in the Dark, of course.) No, =
when White folks write about themselves, they are =0Awriting about America.=
 They are writing about unraced universal =0Aexperience. They are writing a=
bout the ultimate human existence.=0A=0A~=0A=0ANow, it=E2=80=99s not that B=

 something like that. But what=E2=80=99s implied is that =0Acultural produc=
tion assumes humanity from the start. It also assumes =0Asomething else: pr=
ivilege.=0AIn Rita Dove=E2=80=99s introduction to her anthology, she assume=
s her own =0Akind of privilege, intellectual privilege, and her right to cl=
aim that =0Aprivilege galls Helen Vendler, for if Blacks and other poets of=
 color =0Aare not included in Dove=E2=80=99s anthology because of multicult=
uralism, but =0Arather, on their literary merit alone, then the whole Ameri=

cut / paste now) a few haphazard thoughts that speak to these larger issues=
 too:=0A=0AI thought Dove was kind. Vendler's assessment stuck me as elitis=
t and racist on my first read. Second and third reads confirm. Dove could h=
ave been harsher in reply. I =0Ahope others call Vendler out on this (esp a=
s Vendler's represents a larger trend) though across-the-board the general =
focus seems to be on =0ADove's error by omission instead [see Jeffers' abov=
e]. That's the business, I suppose. The parameters of who is "great," and h=
ow we assert that monumental status (as well as who gets to do so), are qui=

=0Aworry about the nearly-unchecked perpetuation of bias for decades or who=
 has been omitted from the canon / the publishing world down the years =0Ab=
ecause of that bias (something Dove is cursorily addressing in the =0Amakin=
g of this anthology) when we can focus on the in's and out's of how Plath a=
nd Ginsberg have been left out in the cold ad nauseum...=C2=A0 [that aspect=
 of the debate seems to boil down to:=C2=A0 Dove was wrong not to have spen=

er, unknowingly, touches on this in her critique of =0ADove's including 'an=

Bursts of Light was the book I was referring to. I am glad you (or Bursts

and long overdue.

Subject:      Dove, Vendler, Beauty is a Verb
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=ISO-8859-1

Hi All,

I have been following the news on Vendler/Dove with a personal dismay. What
is nagging at me is that a relatively mainstream anthology is causing such
a stir. A few months ago Sheila Black, Michael Northen, and I published
Beauty is a Verb: The New Disability Poets & although we got great reviews
from some of my favorite poets, the controversy of the book has been very
nonexistent. My argument isn't that there are real racial and gender
problems that need to be solved. My point is that the arguments about race
and gender are so loud that the civil rights of people with disabilities
are consistently ignored. And the problems of this minority remain so
severe in comparison to other groups.

First, looking at the Dove anthology itself what interests me is the still
glaring lack of attention paid to poets/people with disabilities as a
multicultural group. In what appears to be the ultimate  inclusive
collection Larry Eigner, Vassar Miller, Josephine Miles, Jim Ferris, Paul
Guest are all absent and there is no mention of Crip Poetics The only poet
in the collection who *might* identify as 'disabled" is Duncan, and I'm
guessing the Duncan poems don't address his vision/vision which was
arguably central to his work.

I do think that an anthology, such as ours, which for starters is an
entirely new phenonemen calls for a little attention. Beauty is a Verb
discusses how aphasia is a link to experimental language (Cole), addresses
'crip poetics" which most people have never heard of (Kuppers), speaks to
the linguistically complexity of translating English to ASL (Clark), and
most of all addresses the disabled body as something that is okay, even
sexy and a worthwhile experience.

I wonder if speaking about disability is still a thing that makes people
nervous, and they feel afraid of having a voice. Although there is plenty
of discussion regarding race from white people, and unlike skin color, most
of the able-bodied will have some disability in their lifetime. More
importantly, it seems that people still dismiss disability as a
category/identity and one that is privileged to the most simple rights like
getting into the store or having a job, for gosh sake - not to mention
being in the Penguin anthology.

It also seems true that in the poetry world you have to insult someone
directly or indirectly to get attention - which I did a few years ago when
I called out Paul Guest for allowing John Ashbery to call him an invalid in
his blurb. All hell broke lose & evidently the right to call a person an
invalid is something people of which are very attached to.

But that was the old Jennifer & the new Jennifer wants to be heard without
causing too much anger. & Bob Grenier told me 'fighting is for young
people." Perhaps Rita & Helen need Bobly's phone number!

Richard Kostelanz: The Avant Garde at Brown University: 1960





This appeared on the Boston Area Small Press and Poetry Scene=20
http://dougholder.blogspot.com=20





Richard Kostelanetz, the noted avant-garde writer, was kind enough to sen=
d
this excerpt of an interview conducted at Brown University in 2004 to the=

Boston Area Small Press and Poetry Scene.---Doug Holder



I

Richard Kostelanetz, born in New York City in 1940, went to Brown in 1958=
,
graduating with honors in American Civilization early in 1962. He later d=
id
graduate work at Columbia University in American history and at King=E2=80=
=99s
College, the University of London, as a Fulbright scholar, taking an M.A.=
 at
the former in 1966. Ever since, he has been an independent
scholar/writer/media artist residing, until recently, in lower Manhattan.=

His work in various domains has been recognized with individual entries i=
n
Contemporary Poets, Contemporary Novelists, Postmodern Fiction, Baker=E2=80=
=99s
Biographical Dictionary of Musicians, A Reader=E2=80=99s Guide to Twentie=
th-Century
Writers, the Merriam-Webster Encyclopedia of Literature, Webster=E2=80=99=
s
Dictionary of American Authors, The HarperCollins Reader=E2=80=99s Encycl=
opedia of
American Literature, NNDB.com, and Britannica.com, among other distinguis=
hed
compendia.


The interviewer, whose comments appear here in italics, was Sarah Bird, a=
n
undergraduate working with the radical cultural historian Paul Buhle in t=
he
American Civilization program at Brown University. She talked with Richar=
d
Kostelanetz in November 2004 after RK's lecture to the Coalition of
Independent Scholars at the General Society Library in New York City. RK
corrected and amended the transcript then and, with brackets, later.


I



The only remotely avant-garde entity on campus around 1960 was the colleg=
e
literary magazine that had been edited by the painter John Willenbecher j=
ust
before I arrived. In its small office I met Bill Berkson, who left Brown
only a few months after I arrived, later becoming a prominent poet and ar=
t
critic on the West Coast, who remembers our meeting in the literary magaz=
ine
office in a memoir that I found on the Internet and incidentally reprinte=
d
in my CD-Rom Intellectual Correspondence in the 21st Century (2005): =E2=80=
=9CI can
hear you now, in the Brunonia office, talking of Dissent, PR [Partisan
Review], and other critical journals, of which at the time I knew not one=

thing.=E2=80=9D



In my library is an impressive copy of Brunonia's Fall 1958 issue that
contains contributions by Berkson, Richard Foreman, and myself, each of u=
s
presaging what we later became. While Bill has a critical review of "beat=
"
poetry, Richard contributes not only a short play that he calls "a cartoo=
n,"
but also an extended review of Bertolt Brecht's "epic opera," as he calls=

it, Mahagonny, which Richard was invited to direct decades later in Lille=
,
France. (It didn=E2=80=99t happen, even after being fully prepared, for r=
easons
beyond his control.) My own contribution to Brunonia is a witty aphoristi=
c
dictionary that presages the Dictionary I wrote in 1990 and rewrote a dec=
ade
later. (This issue also has a stylistically unusual story by Peter Goldma=
n,
who briefly became an avant-garde filmmaker before doing something else.)=

May I wonder if other issues of Brunonia and its successors, not to menti=
on
undergraduate literary magazines anywhere, are so professionally propheti=
c?




I knew less Steve Overbeck, perhaps two years ahead of me, who, as S. K.
Overbeck, was later a Newsweek cultural staff writer for a while. Only af=
ter
graduating did I meet Harry Smith, who left Brown just before I came, but=
 as
publisher of a literary periodical titled Pulpsmith he became one of the =
few
Brown alumni to publish me.




I took only one course with S. Foster Damon, a great teacher and a sort o=
f
underground avant-garde celebrity, whom I saw more off-campus, so to spea=
k.
An activist in the art and musical avant-garde dating back to the 1920s, =
he
taught me an awful lot of useful stuff, especially how to be a profession=
al,
which is not quite the same thing as =E2=80=9Chow to write.=E2=80=9D Ther=
e was at Brown
around 1960 no conscious political or artistic avant-garde or underground=
 to
any degree that Paul Buhle, a few years younger than I, understands the
latter term from his own experience at Wisconsin=E2=80=94certainly not wh=
en I was
there in the late fifties and early sixties. Paul edited an anthology of
rich memoirs about the 1950s and 1960s in at the University of Wisconsin
that I recall reading with envy [History and the New Left, 1991], because=

nothing comparable could be written about Brown during those years.



II

For my last three semesters at Brown I lived down Hope Street, next to a
local library that became an historical society; that location was at the=

time really more off-campus than it appeared to be the last time I visite=
d
Brown=E2=80=94in the early 1980s. We lived on the edge of a Portuguese sl=
um called
Fox Point that was probably slummier then than now. And Foster Damon live=
d a
few blocks away, at a parallel distance from the main campus, at 24 Thaye=
r.


Who is Foster Damon?



Foster was an extraordinary man whom I hope is still remembered in some w=
ay
or another at Brown. Do a Google search of his name now, and you=E2=80=99=
ll find a
healthy number of references, thousands I think. His influence persists,
even though he died decades ago. He founded the Harris Collection of poet=
ry
in the library, he knew avant-garde music, and he knew avant-garde
literature. As an undergraduate at Harvard before World War I, he had
co-founded with other students the Harvard Musical Review (1912-1916), wh=
ich
was meant to appreciate contemporary music ignored by their teachers. One=

partner in this Review was a man who went on to a more distinguished care=
er,
the composer Roger Sessions, whose daughter Elizabeth was my Most
Significant Other for many years. Foster=E2=80=99s brother-in-law was the=
 eccentric
Boston poet John Brooks Wheelwright, who died too young, whose literary
executor Foster became, whose poems are treasured to this day by John
Ashbery, among others.


[Since this interview, Ashbery questioned in correspondence with me about=

New Directions waiting thirty years between announcing in 1939 and finall=
y
publishing Wheelwright=E2=80=99s collected poems in 1970, conjecturing th=
at Foster
might have been responsible for the delay, speculating further about
Foster=E2=80=99s possible dementia. Knowing John, I replied that Foster w=
as quite
lucid in 1960-62, when I knew him best, if often pickled. John replied th=
at
the Wheelwright papers kept at Brown were a mess. I recalled that though
Foster sorted American songs for the Harris Collection he wasn=E2=80=99t =
skilled at
detailed archiving. I didn=E2=80=99t recall Foster discussing Wheelwright=
, though he
often mentioned W.S.B. Braithwaite, who had anthologized Foster; but in 1=
960
I might not have recognized Wheelwright=E2=80=99s name. I speculated that=
 perhaps
publication had to wait for his wife Louise, Wheelwright=E2=80=99s sister=
, to return
from institutionalization, as she did just before he died. Since he, not
she, was the official executor, while they didn=E2=80=99t have children, =
my
speculation was admittedly insufficient.]


Foster was important as well for publishing in 1924 the first big book on=

William Blake in America. In this respect, he influenced my wife-to-be, a=

Pembroker, who wrote her Columbia doctorate on Blake and, I=E2=80=99m tol=
d, gave her
son by her next husband the first name of Blake. In the 1930s, Foster
compiled a pioneering anthology of American Songs that subsequently
influenced the musical compositions of his contemporaries Virgil Thomson =
and
Aaron Copland.




Then roughly that same age that I am now=E2=80=94in his mid-sixties--Fost=
er had been
involved in various boys=E2=80=99 clubs in Fox Point, which was then a Po=
rtuguese
slum behind Power Street. Ed Margolis, long an English professor in State=
n
Island, remembers that a decade before me Foster taught boxing to the Fox=

Point kids. Because his wife Louise Wheelwright had been institutionalize=
d
for many years, select local kids would become his house helpers. Some of=

them went on to careers at Brown, like Ernie Costa, who worked in the Bro=
wn
library until he died young. Though Foster had more connection to Fox Poi=
nt
than I did, perhaps my experience there prepared me for my next address,
which was a low-rent public housing project in Harlem, down the hill from=

Columbia University.


Dinner at his Thayer Street house once a week, first for me and then for
both Bunny and myself, was central to our experience of =E2=80=9Cundergro=
und Brown.=E2=80=9D



Were you already interested in the avant-garde when you were at Brown?

Not so consciously. I remember reading on my own initiative Harold
Rosenberg's The Tradition of the New, which turned me onto the idea of th=
e
avant-garde, and then Roger Shattuck=E2=80=99s The Banquet Years. I must =
have
reviewed the Rosenberg book for the undergraduate literary magazine becau=
se
I received an appreciative letter from the publisher who a few years late=
r
did a book of mine. Foster told me a lot, as I said, about the American
avant-garde, not only in literature but also in music.



Did you feel at that time that avoiding the Brown writing program was
probably a wise move?


As a major yes, but not Foster Damon=E2=80=99s verse writing course for w=
hich I
signed up, even though I had no ambitions to write poetry at the time and=
 I
didn=E2=80=99t much like Damon=E2=80=99s assignments, which required us t=
o write poems in a
succession of English verse forms from Beowulf to the present. [A
half-century later, long since a devout radical formalist, I wish I could=

take it again.]


=46rom Foster above all others I probably developed the intellectual ambi=
tion
for always aiming to take my work to a higher level, to go where no one e=
lse
has gone or would go, in my case not only in criticism but creative work =
and
even in this interview I hope, much as he and Cummings did in their own
careers. Remember that Foster=E2=80=99s big book on William Blake, publis=
hed in 1924
when Foster was only thirty-one, achieves an extraordinary unraveling. Ch=
eck
it out sometime to be impressed even now by his powers of elucidation,
defining clarity in literature that previously seemed inscrutable. Foster=

would tell that when he was a graduate student in English lit at Harvard =
in
the early 1920s, supplicants were asked what they thought of William Blak=
e.
It was enough for the student to say, =E2=80=9COh Blake, he=E2=80=99s cra=
zy,=E2=80=9D for the
examiner to move onto another subject. Simply, Foster=E2=80=99s Blake was=
n=E2=80=99t crazy,
and he=E2=80=99s not been crazy since. When I edited a decade ago an anth=
ology of
the more radical Cummings writings, it was appropriate to dedicate that b=
ook
to Foster. From him and from the Brown history professor Bill [William G.=
]
McLoughlin, as well as other intellectual heroes, such as George Orwell,
whom I also discovered in college, also comes the ambition to tell the
truth, even an unfamiliar truth, much as I hope to do here.


Though David Kelly continued to major in creative writing, I realized,
partly through observing David=E2=80=99s experience, that I should stay a=
way from
other Brown writing courses, which I now think were designed to make high=

school teachers. I have a vague recollection of John Hawkes telling me in=
 my
freshmen year that I had =E2=80=9Cno talent for prose.=E2=80=9D Since he =
dismissed me, I had
no reason to take any other courses with him, probably to my good fortune=
,
we could now judge. I must have kept in touch with Hawkes nonetheless
because I remember taking him and his wife Sophie to dinner at Foster
Damon=E2=80=99s. They hadn=E2=80=99t met before, even though they were Ha=
rvard
undergraduates thirty years apart. Should we be surprised that Hawkes nev=
er
contacted me after my graduation, though, need I say, as an alumnus
publishing both fiction and fiction criticism that are recognized in
histories and encyclopedias. If he mentioned my work or even my name to
later Brown students, I=E2=80=99ve never heard about it. Should this be c=
onsidered
another sign of Brown professors=E2=80=99 lack of respect for their more =
successful
students? I remember a close relative of his telling me, perhaps two deca=
des
ago, that Jack =E2=80=9Chated every minute=E2=80=9D of teaching, which ma=
y have been true.


Some alumni writers a generation younger than I have acknowledged John
Hawkes=E2=80=99s importance to their development. One of them, whom I=E2=80=
=99ve not met,
Jeffrey Eugenides, even successfully appropriated the Hawkes formula of a=

narrator whose physical abnormalities give him a peculiar perspective on
experience. Perhaps by Eugenides=E2=80=99 time Hawkes became more respect=
ful of his
better students, not to mention his teaching talents, and thus a more
effective writing teacher.


Probably because Hawkes and Edwin Honig didn=E2=80=99t get tenure at Harv=
ard, where
they had previously taught, they assumed that even their stronger student=
s
were likewise Harvard rejects, as indeed we probably were, though that
stigma didn=E2=80=99t disqualify us finally from literary careers.


David Kelly, at any rate, went on to get an Iowa MFA writing degree and i=
s
now [was, alas] a prominent West Coast editor, whose book on Secrets of t=
he
Old Growth Forest (1990) won an award from northwest booksellers.

Being as I have had no luck getting anything published the past year, I
have decided to digitally release a couple chapbooks I've finished. I'll
release one, well, now and one next week. This first one is named "I
sail. I swim to you. I know the water."

It is a piece about sexual identifications rather than sexual identity
and (more broadly) about about liminal identity spaces of all types and
the psychic and physical violence and trauma which so often exists in
these spaces. It utilizes textual appropriation and collage, formal
constraints, typographical manipulation, and lyric elegy in order to
plomb the depths of a loosely structured, implied narrative that runs
the gamut from an estranged mother and child to a fractured chronicle of
the development of sexual dimorphism, 19th century sexology/psychiatry,
and the subversive significance of alternative sexual & gender based
identifications.

Has anyone missed that the Poetry Foundation is now in the
business of slapping handcuffs and lawsuits on poets and performance

reprehensible treatment of Stephanie Dunn=2C which provoked an act of civil
disobedience by the Croatoan Poetic Cell at the $20=2C000=2C000 PF compound=
 in Chicago (and
which may or may not have been completely civil=2C thank goodness)=2C can b=

in a number of online places=2C including the widely read Salon.com.  Appar=

enough to erect (or lower from the sky) a concrete slab blocking what was
formerly public access to their interior gardens. =20

The Poetry Foundation and its actions=2C here and elsewhere=2C are consiste=

3. =93The Poetry Foundation also plans to build a $25 million
mansion in the Gold Coast with accommodations for visiting poets of its cho=

and a stage to host readings on. An ex-trustee accused the Foundation of ac=

like a =93private club=94 and using Ruth Lilly=92s money for =93personal

(after Barr left as an executive) and a US Attorney said in a letter =93We =

accomplishments as mayor of NYC including a smear campaign against contempo=

critical attacks against Allen Ginsberg and Jack Kerouac.

Apologies for cross-posting.

A couple of announcements that I hope might be of some interest.

Firstly, Forum for Modern Language Studies has recently published an issue
on contemporary poetry, ably edited by Steven Winspur. I've yet to have a
chance to read through much of the rest of the issue, though I look forward
to doing so. I have had to read my own article, much of which is occupied
with a reading of virtuality, and the poetry of Chris Goode. I had a go at
the task, that much is true.

I've pasted the contents below.

Secondly, Blackbox Manifold, edited by Adam Piette and Alex Houen, has a
new issue out that Robin Purves and I had some hand in (a small hand, but a
coaxing/waving one), which includes a number of poets from this end of the
spectrum (insert "You are here" sticker): Rod Mengham, Tim Atkins, Michael
Kindellan, Keston Sutherland, Tom Jones, Vahni Capildeo, and another
showing for a couple of Geoff Ward's  Rilke translations, available from
Equipage. It was nothing to do with us, but there's a fun Geoff
Gilbert/Alex Houen collaboration too, and poetry from Duncan White:

FILMS OF SOUND: austraLYSIS
Saturday 10 December 2011, 8:00pm

  1.  Film of Sound: austraLYSISSydney Conservatorium of Music Recital Hall=
 East

Please note this event is at Recital Hall East, Sydney Conservatorium of Mu=
sic

austraLYSIS will premiere a film-music work, Film of Sound, the film is com=
posed in immediate relation to the sound structure, rather than in the more=
 usual converse relationship. The film will have surfaces that are physical=
, abstract, human and inanimate. At times it will have verbal content displ=
ayed, spoken or deconstructed amongst the sound-image field. This work will=
 be made in a new collaboration with US film-maker Will Luers. Film will al=
so be the basis for a second piece, a real-time manipulation performance, F=
ilm Moves in which austraLYSIS use video material for continuous transforma=
tion, partnered by an algorithmically synaesthetic sound process. Active vi=
ewer and performer transformation of the visual and sonic worlds are at the=
 core of this pair of pieces, which will be complemented by electroacoustic=
 and audio-visual work from David Worrall, an Australian pioneer in the fie=
ld, and Daniel Blinkhorn, both creative members of austraLYSIS. There will =
also be computer-interactive improvisation and new composition by austraLYS=
IS members.

**Bone Bouquet
http://www.bonebouquet.org

For two years, Bone Bouquet has aimed to highlight the important work =20=

of female poets, who are often underrepresented in the writing =20
community and popular media. Rather than personal politics, their =20
criteria are excellence and vibrance. Rather than segregating the =20
poetry of =93women=92s issues=94 from =93regular=94 creative work, their =
goal is =20
to provide an additional arena in which female poets can make their =20
work more visible to readers, building their reputations as artists.

The new ebook from Argotist Ebooks is =E2=80=9CWriting What For? Across the=
 Mourning Sky=E2=80=9D by Raymond Farr

Description:=20
Executing techniques gleaned from Language poetry and its dada/surrealist r=
oots; each poem is a box canyon of meaninglessness tipping its hat to the a=
bsurd. Literary expectations are dashed on the rocks of dire mismeaning, em=
bellishing the nothing that seems an inherent folly, a joke intrinsic to "a=
 turn of phrase." These poems succumb to the glossy experience of recreatin=
g the experience of reading these poems=E2=80=94a  train of thought deraile=
d again and again, until what is obvious becomes radiant/radioactive, but n=
ot meaning to "mean."

Dear Fiends -

What poems and books of poetry - and any of poetry's relevant prose guises,
theorhetorical or otherwise -  would one read as context and study for the
OWS movements? This is a question directed toward teaching a class in the
movement or starting a reading group.

It occurs to me Pound's "With Usura" canto (XLV) might be a start (with its
sounding at say http://nedjudy.com/stuff/usura.html). But I thought it
might be fun to amass such a list, with winter coming and so time to gather
for the spring.

Thanks for your help -


As ever,
Sam

This volume will complement Talisman House's edition of Life Supports: New and Collected Poems of William Bronk, which came out after the North Point Press volume was no longer available, and the Collected Later will include the work from the many volumes that were published post Life Supports (and I think some poems that never made it into that earlier collected, but as I write this I'm  not sure about that  inclusion).

We are planning to have the entire conference audio- and video-recorded (ultimately the audio to be streamed at PennSound and the video at the future Talisman website).

Interesting, this.

Back in May, a friend - Silvia Nanclares - asked a similar question
regarding the #15M movement and all the occupied public spaces here in
Spain.

Many of us answered that question, some web developers joined in, and,
a few weeks later, we had the #Bookcamping project up and running.

Here: http://bookcamping.cc

And it's still going strong. We just completed a crowdfunding campaign
to guarantee its future, and even "official" media are starting to pay
attention to us.

So far, Spanish only, I'm afraid. We're working on that.

Keep the list posted on how this goes - it would be nice to mention it
on our blog.

Best,

Kamen

I was glad to read Richard Kostelanetz' excerpts re: Brown. My own
experience at Brown was equally abysmal; if it wasn't for Damon and the
Waldrops, I would have pretty much collapsed. Keith was really
instrumental and I remember visiting him and Rosmarie on (I think)
Elmgrove Avenue any number of times.

More to the point was an early encounter my freshman year with I. A.
Richard; he had come to speak at Brown, and nuisance that I am, I asked
him to read my poetry. He said he'd get back to me 'in a few weeks' -
instead, I found the poems returned to my mainbox the next morning, fully
annotated and full of encouragement. That meant the world to me at the
time; his generosity (in the midst of a busy schedule) was amazing.

Just to let you know that there is a publishing company called Book on Dema=
nd (Human Touch Publishing) who have an Amazon store and who, without my pe=
rmission, are selling a print-on-demand version of my ebook "Carrier of the=
 Seed". I=E2=80=99ve asked them to remove it or else I will seek legal advi=
ce.  Here is the link to the sales page:=20

They also are selling it at another site, here:

I can=E2=80=99t find anything about this company. It looks like they poach =
already published books and ebooks and charging inflated prices for them, s=
o watch out for them in case they try the same thing with any of your alrea=

Somatic Engagement (Chain Links) booklaunch! If you find yourself in
SF on December 15th, please join Katherine Sherwood, Georgina Kleege,
Amber DiPietra, Denise Leto, Eleni Stecopoulos and Christian Nagler at
the Green Arcade bookstore (1680 Market Street), at 7.30.

Somatic Engagement: the politics, poetics and publics of embodiment.
Chain Links books, 2001. 128 pages, 12 color plates, $16, order
through Small Press Distribution
(http://www.spdbooks.org/Producte/9781930068513/somatic-engagement.aspx)

Edited by community artist, scholar, and dancer Petra Kuppers (author
of Disability Culture and Community Performance), the book opens with
Arnieville, a Californian protest camp of disability, homelessness,
and poverty activists.

 From there, a series of enactments welcome trespass and incursion in
the name of survival.

Amy Sara Carroll on the Transborder Immigrant Tool, a GPS phone that
uses poetry to lead the disoriented and thirsty to water caches and
safety sites in the US-Mexican borderlands.

Devora Neumark on washing Tali Goodfriend?s hands in Lebanese olive
oil outside the hotel where Colin Powell speaks to the Jewish National
Fund, hands gliding over one another in the middle of an angry public
protest.

Christian Nagler on writing an experimental novel while conducting an
oral history of agricultural labor practices and migration patterns at
the site of the Panamerican Highway in El Salvador.

Georgina Kleege on touch and blindness as she discusses Katherine
Sherwood?s paintings of magic and the human brain, paintings that
Sherwood began after her stroke ten years ago.

Eleni Stecopoulos on the healing quest as research and the
complexities of cultural appropriation.

Amber DiPietra and Denise Leto on the collaborative connections of
breath, body, pause, pain, and form.

Somatic Engagement is an exploration of how relation and support play
out in breaths, steps, and touch.

OTHERWISE, here are some rather damning factoids about John
Barr et al, lifted from the comments section at the Montevidayo blog:

=20

1. =E2=80=9CThe Illinois State=E2=80=99s Attorney is looking into
allegations of poor =E2=80=9Cfiscal practices, conflict of interest, nepoti=
sm and
playing fast and loose with the rules of charitable organizations=E2=80=9D =
(concerning the
Poetry Foundation)

=20

2. =E2=80=9CPenny Barr, wife of John Barr, who admits she is =E2=80=9Cnot
versed in poetry,=E2=80=9D was paid $23,000 by the Foundation for setting u=
p a poetry
contest.=E2=80=9D

=20

3. =E2=80=9CThe Poetry Foundation also plans to build a $25 million
mansion in the Gold Coast with accommodations for visiting poets of its cho=
ice
and a stage to host readings on. An ex-trustee accused the Foundation of ac=
ting
like a =E2=80=9Cprivate club=E2=80=9D and using Ruth Lilly=E2=80=99s money =
for =E2=80=9Cpersonal
gratification.=E2=80=9D

[source: http://chicagopoetry.com/modules.php?op=3Dmodload&name=3DNews&file=
=3Darticle&sid=3D1342]

=20

4. The company Barr founded, Dynergy, frequently likened in
business columns to Enron, paid out a $3 million fine for accounting fraud
(after Barr left as an executive) and a US Attorney said in a letter =E2=80=
=9CWe have
become increasingly concerned that Dynegy=E2=80=99s =E2=80=98cooperation=E2=
=80=99 is more apparent than
real.=E2=80=9D

=20

5. John Barr donated the maximum to Rudolph Giuliani in
early 2007, a month after Giuliani declared his candidacy. Giuliani=E2=80=
=99s
accomplishments as mayor of NYC including a smear campaign against contempo=
rary
artists and the Brooklyn Museum that displayed them, attempting to defund t=
he
institution. Soon after Barr=E2=80=99s donation, Giuliani named as his fore=
ign policy
adviser Norman Podhoretz right after he published the book World War III wh=
ich
advocated a global war, who in a previous life as a literary editor engaged=
 in
critical attacks against Allen Ginsberg and Jack Kerouac.

=20

6. Barr=E2=80=99s current company is lobbying foreign governments,
mostly Spanish speaking countries in the hemisphere, to privatize their nat=
ural
resources on behalf of his clients.

=20

7. Robert Pinsky takes credit for selecting Barr for his
position.

HAPPY READING!

On the occasion of Emily Dickinson's birthday, and a day before Jerome Roth=
enberg's 80th, "Two Poems, after Emily Dickinson," written when he was abou=
t 20. From his collection "Retrievals: Uncollected & New Poems 1955-2010," =
available (at a discount) at junctionpress.com.

Note the final wicked slant rhyme.



Two Poems, after Emily Dickinson

1
The last train left at five o=E2=80=99clock,
Somehow we missed the way;
We=E2=80=99ll have to sit in waiting rooms
until eternity.

Tickets form an ark of snow,
Water comes in drops,
While this earth-bound passenger
Studies secret maps,

Inquires at the agent=E2=80=99s door
If the next train leaves,
Anxious to reduce delay
To a term of weeks.

When it chanced, we couldn=E2=80=99t tell
That it would always be
This waiting in a busy room
For immortality.

2
The birds attain superior life
The others never find;
I wish my obligations
Might dabble with the wind.

Within his strictest tenement
Deciduous to rise,
That wing confining aviary
To me were Paradise.

But mapping bounds of heaven,
Topographers will pause
Before they reach that other house,
And justify the jaws.

Essential circumscription,
I find its premise odd,
Which grants necessity of bird,
But contradicts the cat.

I just got a reply from Book on Demand:

"Hi Jeff, thank you very much for your email, we provide self publishing service and sometimes, very rarely some people upload works that don't belong to them. I will make sure the book will be off sale ASAP, and I will write a letter requesting to block the account of person who uploaded your book."

So much depends on perception. I forwarded Jared's email to my sister who w=
as at the poetry reading. She vehemently disagreed with just about everythi=
ng, but she does tend to have a more "establishment" view of the arts. I do=
 think that poets need to be difficult and cantankerous, and they need to g=
o against the standards of the moneyed establishment, but without being ver=
y specific, most people's agendas are not always pure, and perhaps that is =
impossible. =0A=0A=0AMary=0A=0A=0A=0A________________________________=0A Fr=

"If you think poetry is some sedate pursuit carried out in an ivory tower
then you obviously ain't read Steven Fowler. He makes Bukowski look like
Billy Childish and Billy Childish look like William MacGonagall!"      *Stewart
Home*

 "Imagine a *Boys Own Paper* landscape with *True Crime* architecture.
Laurence Harvey dodges from building to country trying to evade CCTV whose
sound footage runs through Babelfish.  The smells are Jack London, the
light is Genet and the memories are Edgar Lee Masters.  Equally in words is
Steven Johannes Fowler's *Minimum Security Prison Dentistry*: elegant,
coldly funny, at times emotional, textured with occasional
accidental/intentional solecisms; but getting the work done.  Nowadays most
pages labelled "poetry" are unreadable and uninteresting: these give hope.
Anyone who can name-check Joe Arpaio and Jacky le Mat, and reference the
cover-texture of an Anselm Hollo book from the sixties rides my particular
range."        * **Tom Raworth*

Thanks for these links, I've been wondering exactly how  Poetry could have
gotten so far off base from the vision of Harriet Monroe, and these
articles paint a pretty clear picture.  Elucidating.

wish I cd be there. just reading yr essay abt teaching in attack of the
difficult poems & stole a few exercises--I assume that's ok--and quoted
you on what poetry did long ago then later & now.
wish you wd write something abt whether poetry has had it or whether
it's morphing into something else, beyond saying it's abt the medium
now--maybe you have...? ecopoetry is stirring...
thank you for yourself.

Extraordinary Powers
Poems by Philip Rush

Three Cheers for Dina Vierny | Wednesday, June 23, 2010: The System
Black Coat | Extraordinary Powers | Modish Boots

Philip Rush's first full collection, Big Purple Garden Paintings,
was short-listed for the prestigious Aldeburgh First Collection
Prize in England, but didn't win. Rush lives in Stroud in
Gloucestershire where he plays the electric violin for fun. He has
recently been involved in organising a 'Lorca in England' festival
which included an international translation competition judged by
Mark Statman and Pablo Medina.

Just wanted to let folks know that /Cloud Computing/, a new collection
from Josh May has launched from 3rdness, an imprint of Fifth Planet
Press. Available at SPD. And if you are on the fence and need a blurb to
sway you, here you go:

CLOUD COMPUTING supposes the sui generous and then is so bold as to use
any means necessary to "compute" said thing/world. The answers are
pulled down from clouds, black boxes, and the like, and they seem mostly
correct. Any detectable errors seem immediately to fall under
Wittgenstein's mantra "The world is all that is the case," or Frank
O'Hara's gravestone, "Grace to be born and live as variously as
possible," or maybe even Warhol via Cale, "Faces and names, I wish they
were the same." If this book of poems were a movie, it would be a
blockbuster action flick with lots of pyrotechnics, and you can bet its
tagline would be: There is no nexus in the cloud.

That was great on I> A> Richard's part and showed his good and catholic
taste in poetry. My sojourn at Anherst College was also abyssal. Who saved
me was the philosophy professor at the time at Amherst Kai Nielson from him
I took a modern philosophy tutorial (including readings from Wittgenstein's
Brown, etc,. books) without any credit and baby sat their children. We
became very good friends.

Subject:      Tan Lin's INSOMNIA AND THE AUNT
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=windows-1252; format=flowed
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

…was published in the spring of 2011 as a limited edition artist’s book,
with covers designed and letterpress printed by Rebecca Cooling-Mallard
and interior composition by Patrick Durgin. As well as gaining notice
from, among others, Brooklyn Rail’s artist’s books columnist, and
featuring with Printed Matter, the world’s preeminent dealer of
publications by artists, Insomnia and the Aunt was then known mainly to
an equally “limited edition” of literati. Yet it was nominated for the
Asian/Pacific American Librarians Association Award in the summer and
enthusiastically lauded in literary journals, such as Constant Critic.
Now the book is being re-printed and re-launched as a deluxe paperback
book suitable for the trade, libraries, and a general audience of
readers. The book uniquely yokes avant-garde risk and biographical
intrigue. It is poignant, arch, challenging, and accessible, all at
once. Alongside its recent adjunct, the online “Patio and the Index,”
Insomnia and the Aunt ushers in a new form of essay-narrative-poem: an
“ambient novel.” In Lin’s increasingly influential oeuvre, it extends a
project he dubs “ambient stylistics” into the evolving category of
literary nonfiction, i.e. “life writing.”

…is an ambient novel composed of black and white photographs, postcards,
Google reverse searches, letters, appendices, an index to an imaginary
novel, re-runs and footnotes. The aunt in question can’t sleep. She runs
a motel in the Pacific Northwest. She likes watching Conan O’Brien late
at night. She may be the narrator’s aunt or she may be an emanation of a
TV set. Structured like everybody’s scrapbook, and blending fiction with
non-fictional events, Insomnia and the Aunt is about identities taken
and given up, and about the passions of an immigrant life, rebroadcast
as furniture. Ostensibly about a young man’s disintegrating memory of
his most fascinating relative, or potentially a conceptualist take on
immigrant literature, it is probably just a treatment for a prime-time
event that, because no one sleeps in motels, lasts into the late night
and daytime slots.

…is one among many works. Tan Lin is the author of Lotion Bullwhip
Giraffe, BlipSoak01, Ambience is a Novel with a Logo, Heath
(Plagiarism/Outsource), 7 Controlled Vocabularies and Obituary 2004. The
Joy of Cooking, and Heath Course Pak. His work has appeared in numerous
journals including Conjunctions, Artforum, Cabinet, New York Times Book
Review, Art in America, and Purple. His video, theatrical and LCD work
have been shown at the Marianne Boesky Gallery, Yale Art Museum,
Sophienholm Museum (Copenhagen), Ontological Hysterical Theatre, and as
part of the Whitney Museum of American Art’s Soundcheck Series. Lin is
the recipient of a Getty Distinguished Scholar Grant for 2004-2005 and a
Warhol Foundation/Creative Capital Arts Writing Grant to complete a
book-length study of the writings of Andy Warhol. He has taught at the
University of Virginia and Cal Arts, and currently teaches creative
writing at New Jersey City University.

REQUITED isue #6 is almost here--just one more month. We will be hosting a =
series of multi-media and performative works attentive to language as sound=
 curated by guest editor Ryan T Dunn.
http://www.requitedjournal.com

Sound & Language Performance:
Consider the psychological and phenomenological aspects of the reception an=
d manifestation of sound as a linguistic act, as a revisitable document, as=
 an intangible moment on breath and a long distance transmittable gesture. =
Ponder the history of the textual document and its relationship with the re=
latively young sonic document. Encompass methods of transmission and recept=
ion, the notable and the mundane, the intentional and unintentional, public=
 and private, seen and heard.

Pavement Saw Chapbook Contest: Deadline 12/31
<<<<<<<<<<<<<<>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
Submit electronically, save the hassle of printing out a manuscript and have your funds support poetry not the post office! Directly enter by using our website http://www.pavementsaw.org/pages/chapcontest.htm

$500 and 50 copies of the winning chapbook will be awarded to the winner. In addition to the prize winner, at least one other manuscript will be published under a standard royalty contract (author paid 10% of press run). Everyone is allowed to submit regardless of previous publication history. Every entrant will receive the equivalent cost of the entry fee in Pavement Saw Press titles.

Unlike many publishers whose collections are printed one copy at a time and therefore lack a large circulation, our chapbooks are published in a first edition of 400 copies plus overage. While chapbooks rarely receive exposure, ours have been reviewed in Poets and Writers, Publishers Weekly, The Georgia Review, Small Press Review and many others. Our previous winners have had subsequent full length books appear from a bevy of publishers including Ahsahta Press, Curbstone Press, Cleveland State University Press, Birds llc, Bear Star Press, BlazeVOX, Shearsman Books, Futurepoem Books, University of Georgia, Tupelo Press, Hanging Loose Press and so on.

Submit up to 32 pages of poetry. Include a signed cover letter with your name, address, phone number, e-mail, publication credits, a brief biography and the title of the chapbook. Include a cover page with your contact information and the chapbook title. Include a second page with the chapbook title only. Do not include your name on any pages inside the manuscript except for the first title page. No need for a contents page. All chapbooks are selected blindly / anonymously. Manuscripts will be considered until December 31st, 2011. Entry fee: $15 for US entries, $18 overseas, $21 electronic (world wide).

If you wish to submit electronically, send $21.00 via paypal to info@pavementsaw.org. Then e-mail the manuscript as an attachment to the same address and we will send you an e-mail confirmation that your entry is all set. Electronic submissions need to be sent as PDF files or as word (.doc or .docx) files. Other formats are not accepted. The extra cost is to cover the paypal fees as well as the time, labor, ink, and so on, to print out your manuscript. Or use our website http://www.pavementsaw.org/pages/chapcontest.htm

If you wish to send via regular mail, have your envelope postmarked by December 31st and accompany your manuscript with a check in the amount of $15.00 payable to Pavement Saw Press. All contributors to the contest will receive books, chapbooks and journals equal to, or more than, the entry fee. Add $3 (US) for other countries to cover the extra postal charge. Do not include an SASE for notification of results. Do not send the only copy of your work. All manuscripts are recycled and individual comments on the manuscripts cannot be made. This year the editor will be the judge and, as it should be, he promises not to chose former students, former or potential sexual partners, press interns, or people that can make him famous. A decision will be reached in March. Entries should be sent to our address at the bottom of the page.

These are and are not products of thought.

They are in that they are produced with a program I wrote in JavaScript
called Aleph Null.

They are not in that they were generated by Aleph Null and I did not
anticipate them. They come as a surprise to me.

Also surprising to me is their sometimes organic and also sexual quality or
associations. I wondered why they have these unintended properties.

My 'answer' is that the development and evolution of life involved related
dynamic processes of generation. The same process operates over a length of
a curve or an area to produce a simple or fundamental organic shape. Related
to the sort of thing Darcy Thompson wrote about in On Growth and Form.

Most of these graphics are 1920x1080. Best to go fullscreen via your F11 key
or the View>Fullscreen menu option. Many of them thrive in darkness far
below the surface of consciousness; dim or turn off the lights. Many of them
are best viewed by the light of the moon. There are a total of 165 images.

You can view the captured specimens at
http://vispo.com/aleph/jim/index.htm?n=97 or you can view them in their
native interactive habitat at http://vispo.com/aleph/an.htm . However,
hunting beautiful ones requires a bit of practice. Like hunting butterflys,
beauty, or the snark. Best to follow the instructions at bottom right.

does anyone out there teach an "intro to poetics" course to advanced
ugrads? if so, what books do you order? i've got Aristotle and a
poetry/cultural studies anthology, but what else have people done?
backchannel ideas for books and or syllabi.
i will probably end up cobbling together some kind of pdf patchwork but
... any ideas?

"In those days, too, a man's pair of pants was never properly sewn if it
lacked the akpa alaehe -- that small shallow pocket that rested right on
the right side of his groin and in which the precious pennies and farthings
took refuge from the risky banters. A man's pennies needed to be closer to
his penis. A man guarded his pennies with his penis, with his life. Even
when banks have promised to take over the risks of looking after a man's
dough, he still feels uncomfortable that his pennies are far from the daily
watch of his penis."

A multi-genre collection that stretches the meaning of "book"
http://www.furtherfield.org/friendsofspork/tlc.html

It's a collage, a mish-mash, a bunch of poems, emails written from an
ICU, and -- hopefully - not a mess.

It's the secret Part 2 to City Bird
http://www.blazevox.org/index.php/Shop/Poetry/city-bird-selected-poems-1991-2009-by-millie-niss-edited-by-martha-deed-192/

Hi Maria,

I've decided that the best intro to poetics isn't through theory so much=20=

(you mention Aristotle and the idea of a cultural studies antho, as=20
examples) as through stylistics. Stylistics as you know is situated=20
somewhere between literature and linguistics.

For third-year undergrad, Paul Simpson's Stylistics: A resource book for=20=

students (Routledge 2010) works very well, giving you lots of room to=20
differ from the textbook while establishing a base of knowledge / ways=20=

of doing.

For more senior than third year, try The Language and Literature Reader=20=

edited by Ronald Carter and Peter Stockwell (Routledge 2008).

If you still want to preserve a connection to theory, try The Routledge=20=

Language and Cultural Theory Reader edited by Lucy Burke, Tony=20
Crowley and Alan Girvin (Routledge 2000) if it's still in print.

I could go on for a long time and get quite excited about this thread.

And may your threads me forever red, Maria --

Louis

I taught it twice as "reading poetry" & writing reviews, assembled my
own reader both times -- essays mostly from proquest, Harryette Mullen
I remember was the one people responded well to, Joan Retallack...
some public domain stuff -- Eliot, Poe...

Maria,

Organic Poetry may be an odd angle from which to teach poetics, but it's =
my offering and available in 2012 from Apprentice House press. See =
Organic Poetry.org for essays and other materials which you may find =
useful.

Good luck with your course and Happy Solstice.

Paul

We at Jacket2 have temporarily changed the web address for all
articles, reviews, etc., published in Jacket between 1997 and 2010.

The temporary address is:  http://jacket1.writing.upenn.edu/01/index.shtml

We have been working on a problem with the Australian domain and hope
to have everything back to normal soon. Then, as always, all Jacket
materials will be linked and accessible from the front page of
Jacket2. Jacket2 of course continues uninterrupted at https://jacket2.org
  .

In order to keep web search engines from picking up the temporary URL,
we ask that you refrain from linking any of the temporarily web page
addresses on the web (including social media).

MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=ISO-8859-1

I wrote two chapbooks this year. I finished a book, for all intents and
purposes, this year. Having not found a home for any of them, I decided
rather than let them linger on my hard drive, I would just put them on
Scribd and attempt to just release them digitally, for free, and hopefully
people would read them and enjoy them. I (like many others), lost my job
this year and so this was the most affordable way for me to self-publish.
Beyond that, people can print them out (8.5x11) if they want physical
copies, download them, or just read them on Scribd, so there's flexibility.
I do hope people will take the time to read them and, if they feel so
compelled, contact me if for no other reason than to offer their thoughts &
criticisms.

Longinus' on great writing, wordsworth's preface, abc of reading & a few
don'ts from an imagisteby pound, a selection from stein's lectures in
america, spring and all by williams, first surrealist manifesto by breton,
cesaire on negritude, fanon selections, celan's meridian speech, lorca's in
search of duende, fitterman and place's notes on conceptualisms...I'm
thinking of mostly fully formed books or authors in general.

Dear Maria,

I think that a good intro. to poetics should include something from
Roman Jakobson.  I've taught  graduate classes on linguistics and
literature which have highlighted his work and they have been
successful.  Since I teach at an art school now [with no graduate
degrees], I am revising this course into a "linguistics and the arts"
course, in which Jakobson will be a prominent source.  If you look at
the paperback edition of his collected essays on *Language and
Literature* [Harvard Univ. Press], you will find fascinating essays on
"Questions of Literary Theory" that treats  things like  Futurism,
Dada, Russian formalism, as well as potentially poetic things like
aphasia.

You will also find essays on the grammar of poetry, which treat the
poetry of grammar as well.  This section treats some Russian
modernists, as well as analyses of Baudulaire, Shakespeare, Yeats,
Turgenev,as well as "subliminal verbal patterning in poetry."

There is also a collection of essays devoted to Russian modernists
[poets, Pasternak, and critics], as well as a section of essays
devoted  to "semiotic vistas."  Here we get Jakobson's take on
translation issues; semiotics; the relationship between musicology &
linguistics; film, and the relation between visual and auditory signs;
as well as an essay on 'William Blake and other poet-painters.'

My experience has been that sophisticated students will become
enthralled by Jakobson, as I and my students have.

I think that a course that introduces students to Stein, Cage,
Ashbery, Spicer, et al., should also introduce them to Jakobson.

George Thompson

MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

Pavement Saw Chapbook Contest: Postmark Deadline 12/31 (or midnight PCT for electronic submissions)

<<<<<<<<<<<<<<>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
Submit electronically, save the hassle of printing out a manuscript and have your funds support poetry not the post office! Directly enter by using our website http://www.pavementsaw.org/pages/chapcontest.htm

$500 and 50 copies of the winning chapbook will be awarded to the winner. In addition to the prize winner, at least one other manuscript will be published under a standard royalty contract (author paid 10% of press run). Everyone is allowed to submit regardless of previous publication history. Every entrant will receive the equivalent cost of the entry fee in Pavement Saw Press titles.

Unlike many publishers whose collections are printed one copy at a time and therefore lack a large circulation, our chapbooks are published in a first edition of 400 copies plus overage. While chapbooks rarely receive exposure, ours have been reviewed in Poets and Writers, Publishers Weekly, The Georgia Review, Small Press Review and many others. Our previous winners have had subsequent full length books appear from a bevy of publishers including Ahsahta Press, Curbstone Press, Cleveland State University Press, Birds llc, Bear Star Press, BlazeVOX, Shearsman Books, Futurepoem Books, University of Georgia, Tupelo Press, Hanging Loose Press and so on.

Submit up to 32 pages of poetry. Include a signed cover letter with your name, address, phone number, e-mail, publication credits, a brief biography and the title of the chapbook. Include a cover page with your contact information and the chapbook title. Include a second page with the chapbook title only. Do not include your name on any pages inside the manuscript except for the first title page. No need for a contents page. All chapbooks are selected blindly / anonymously. Manuscripts will be considered until December 31st, 2011. Entry fee: $15 for US entries, $18 overseas, $21 electronic (world wide).

If you wish to submit electronically, send $21.00 via paypal to info@pavementsaw.org. Then e-mail the manuscript as an attachment to the same address and we will send you an e-mail confirmation that your entry is all set. Electronic submissions need to be sent as PDF files or as word (.doc or .docx) files. Other formats are not accepted. The extra cost is to cover the paypal fees as well as the time, labor, ink, and so on, to print out your manuscript. Or use our website http://www.pavementsaw.org/pages/chapcontest.htm

If you wish to send via regular mail, have your envelope postmarked by December 31st and accompany your manuscript with a check in the amount of $15.00 payable to Pavement Saw Press. All contributors to the contest will receive books, chapbooks and journals equal to, or more than, the entry fee. Add $3 (US) for other countries to cover the extra postal charge. Do not include an SASE for notification of results. Do not send the only copy of your work. All manuscripts are recycled and individual comments on the manuscripts cannot be made. This year the editor will be the judge and, as it should be, he promises not to chose former students, former or potential sexual partners, press interns, or people that can make him famous. A decision will be reached in March. Entries should be sent to our address at the bottom of the page.

Williams's Prologue to Kora in Hell (pairs as wonderful counter to TSE's
Tradition and Individual Talent, and written at the same time) and/or Spring
and All, and don't forget Mina Loy; but wow, your list is huge or rather
mammoth already, and I'd think Charles Bernstein's A Poetics (the essay)
might cover most, um, bases.

for Carol Novack

http://www.alansondheim.org/blanking.mp4

I was working on this, shot with Foofwa d'Imobilite at Eyebeam,
when I heard the news that Carol Novack had died. for many of us,
this was unexpected and awful, as if the year couldn't end
without just one more tragedy. Foofwa and I had talked about our
work together, earlier, about issues of pain, wounding, death;
I think this piece, made at the time, is all I could do, I speak
through image and sound, these words already lost, resting in
peace

thank you Foofwa and Jamie and Jackson at Eyebeam

Thanks to all who have responded so generously to my query. I've had a
few requests from others to see the eventual results, and/or the
suggestions. Will compile and share w/ polist when i have a chance to
sit down and hammer out my syllabus.
Happy new year to you all, dear po-faces!

MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=ISO-8859-1; format=flowed
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

Hello wonderful readers,

We are very pleased to announce the hiring of two new staffers for
/Unlikely Stories: Episode IV/:

*Margret Crist* is our new Music Director. Margret lives by the Frisco
Bay and is training to become a mad scientist one day. One day, while
absently reviewing whale songs, she found herself reviewing music for
Stereokill.net. Sometimes, she writes haiku about how she hates her job.

The music department will not be greatly revamped from its format in
/Unlikely 2.0/, however, Margret will be attending shows in the SF Bay
Area and reviewing them at the Unlikely Blog (
http://www.unlikelystories.org/blog/ ), in addition to her work
selecting featured musical artists. To facilitate that, she'll have an
/Unlikely/ press pass! This is something we find amusing.

We will be changing the way that we present political essays, and to
facilitate that, we've hired *Joseph Rose* as Political Editor. Joseph
Rose is a graduate student studying Sociology at Georgia State
University. He's into critical discourse analysis and cultural studies.
He is a spouse, a parent, and a news junkie. Joseph believes that our
current socio-political system is so thoroughly broken that desperate
action is needed from all sectors of society, and that civil
disobedience, radical self-expression, and other forms of socially
condemned behavior are necessary to improve humanity's condition. He
joined /Unlikely Stories/ in order to work with the literary/artistic
community in promoting social change. We shall send him a press pass as
well, just to see if it gets him kicked out of Occupy General Assemblies.

Meanwhile, the videos from the Lafayette, Louisiana read for 100
Thousand Poets for Change and the Nov. 4th Unlikely read in Lafayette at
Cité des Arts are up at http://www.youtube.com/user/JonathanPenton.
Videos for the Nov. 6th Unlikely read in New Orleans at the Maple Leaf
are forthcoming. *Jonathan Penton* is working on the new global site for
100 Thousand Poets for Change ( http://www.100tpc.org/ )
<http://www.100tpc.org/>, and getting ready to accept submissions for
his feature in the 2012 issue of /Big Bridge/
<http://www.bigbridge.org/> ( http://www.bigbridge.org/ ): /Cuyahoga
Burning/, on current Ohio literature. Watch this space!

*Gabriel Ricard* is continuing to post awesome book reviews at the
Unlikely Blog, and when /Unlikely Stories: Episode IV/ launches, he'll
be doing an in-depth feature on artist and vocalist Jessicka Addams.

Our target release date for the first issue of /Unlikely Stories:
Episode IV/ is March 1st. Before then, we'll need a new Art Director,
who will handle visual art and film submissions. Interested? Write to
jonathan@unlikelystories.org <mailto:jonathan@unlikelystories.org>.

Kisses,
Jonathan

hi all

am revamping my contemp Am poetry (which used to be chronological) to
include ecopoetry, innovative women's poetry, queer theory poetry (which
I need to bone up on--no pun intended), spiritual poetry, poetry of
disability, & so on--thanks to the conf at Columbia a few yrs ago &
talks with Tim Peterson.
So I am surrounded by books & winnowing this down is going to be a neat
trick or a messy one. This is only tangentially related to what you
asked about, Maria, but thought I'd mention it, as people give you
wonderful suggestions & you decide which to use. students don't read
much these days...

Carol Novack died of lung cancer yesterday, 12/29/11, at 8:55 pm. She was a=
 genre-defying writer of lyrical and inventive work who brought together th=
ousands of literary, visual, and musical artists from around the globe in c=
ollaboration and exploration as publisher of the wonderful Mad Hatters' Rev=
iew. She was also my good friend, quite irreplaceable.
The editors of the Mad Hatters' Review Blog would like to offer publication=

I'd look for the TRG stuff that bpNichol and Steve McCaffery invented.

the murmur and breathing

http://www.alansondheim.org/radhu.wav

of something just outside the potential of a sphere
caught in a mesmeric or ectoplasmic field...

i remember the sound, somewhat, a kind of murmuring from a
vietnamese oboe, lowered in pitch, the over-recording
transformed into a form of breathing, the whole becoming-
an-animal like myself, a musing or shuffling, or a jostling,
but of notes and spatial magnitudes of unbearable beauty

http://www.alansondheim.org/iamperfect.mp4

a rough patch or rough spot. something rough in the narrative.
uncompromising. something about perfect. i could hardly hear
him. the storm...

i remember the cube with the voice announcing perfect, as if
it were impossible to speak in the grey dawn, when only
bandages held the limbs together, it might have been after
sex, or after a war, or an overpowering examination, this
untoward chanting of a mantra, i am perfect, i am perfect,
when everything, in the cold grey dawn, spilled otherwise

There is a gap forming in how and by what means poetry is preserved. A larg=
e part of the gap involves America in relation to Europe, and online in rel=
ation to print. I believe these issues are going to become imposing, so I w=
