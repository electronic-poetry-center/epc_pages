There's Mary Kinzie, in _The Cure of Poetry in an Age of Prose_
Vernon Shetley, in _After the Death of Poetry_

both have it in for Mr. Ashbery.

And you're sure to have colleagues and students with something to say
on the matter.

yeah, dandelion has a website, but I don't think it's been updated in a
while.  But then again, neither has filling Station's.

But of course the website isn't really a reflection of the magazine's
quality is it.

For my invitation to this conference I understand that in addition to
the two universities in Tomsk where I am teaching English this year,
Tomsk Polytechnic University and Tomsk State Pedagogical University, I
have also to thank the Engineering Plant of the City of Yurga, the
Administration of the City of Yurga, the Institute of Education in
Siberia, Far East and North, and the Russian Academy of Education. So
I ask you to please accept my expression of gratitude for the
invitation to contribute a few words in English to this conference. I
speak simply as a teacher of English who has taught English last year
in Chita, Russia, and in the United States for several years before
coming to work in Russia. You can imagine that I have had many
conversations with Russian teachers of English about teaching methods,
materials, and motivation. So I cannot forget to mention them now,
collectively, since I wish to express my gratitude for their inspiring
example and their influence, and to express also my awareness of their
dedication to their profession.

We read all the time that we live in a rapidly changing world, and
among these transformations might be included the way English is
studied not only in Russia, but around the world. In an earlier time a
student might choose to study this language for the same reason they
might study German or French or any other of the world's many great
languages. Their curriculum would include country studies, culture
studies, and strict attention the linguistic structure of that
language. But today's students come to the English-language classroom
with the awareness that it is the major language for internet
communications, employment possibilities, and information. This latter
category includes of course the vast amount of technical and
scientific information available in English either on the internet or
from professional and educational exchanges among scholars and
technicians from all countries facilitated by university-sponsored
websites and calls for international conferences, and it is the
English language which is typically used for these communications and
collaborations, even among people who have never travelled to England
or America nor studied the culture and customs of the people who live
there. This is the contemporary English of the "lingua franca," or
English as an International Language, and it is this language which
students express the need to learn quickly and efficiently. None of my
students at either TPU or TSPU express an interest in teaching
English. Instead, they say they are planning to work as
interpreters. In their professional journal, "Views," non-native
teachers on the English faculty at the University of Vienna have
included among their researches an exchange of views about the
difference between teaching English as a Foreign Language and teaching
English as an International Language, in response to the pressure that
is brought to bear on the teaching of English in the university when
so many textbooks are currently being published in England and America
showing them how to do something which they have been successfully
doing for years. The difference, according to this linguistic journal
published by a university in Austria, is that contemporary textbooks
from England and America are part of a private language school and
certification industry that produces materials and especially
examinations which are full of many subjective and unconscious
attitudes and attributes which they call "Anglo-centrism." This
criticism is instructive to me, since it reminds me of difficulties
that can arise in the use of a textbook, and I will give you the
following example.

Using materials from the FCE coursebooks (First Certificate
Examination) for a class with teachers from the technical faculties at
TPU, we studied a transcript from the coursebook which asked the
listener to identify a range of attitudes and opinions expressed by
six speakers talking about the experiences of buying a home. I quote
from the textbook: "This speaker can't keep up with expenses. This
speaker thinks house prices are too high. This speaker thinks that
houses are not worth buying. This speaker thinks buying a house is
worth the trouble. This speaker worries about paying off a debt. This
speaker wishes they hadn't bought their house." There is really only
one contrary opinion expressed here among five very similar shades of
opinion which express an identical content, and the one contrary
opinion appears in the form of an idiom. Accompanying references to
mortgages, interest rates, down payments, capital improvements and the
depreciation of value, many real-life or idiomatic expressions such as
"it wasn't worth it" and "I'd turn back the clock if I could"
interfere with the difficulty of understanding the content about
private ownership of the home, familiarity with which is assumed by
the textbook. I give this as an example of cross-cultural difficulty,
since the listener is being asked to learn from the same text at the
same time technical vocabulary about such private ownership in
addition to the emotional language used to communicate conflicting
attitudes towards this ownership, which is one of the central
life-defining experiences for most of the people who belong to this
society. Not only is the technical vocabulary difficult, but it is
introduced in a natural setting where speakers are heard saying they
wanted to have something to leave to their children, or you can't plan
for anything anymore because you simply don't know what's going to
happen, no one's job is secure, or that it was a mistake, and life in
the rented flat really wasn't so bad compared to their debt to the
bank. On the one hand, it is easy to imagine that such materials are
included in an effort to be realistic about just how difficult it is
for many people in England and America to own their own homes, and
just how many people fail to succeed and who fall victim to personal
debt. Maybe it is included to prepare the English-language learner who
may immigrate to England, Canada or America for the culture shock of
daily life there. On the other hand, the language-learning exercise is
easily lost in the questions raised about the concept of the
mortgage. Among the questions recently asked of the Ambassador from
Greece who spoke at Tomsk Polytechnic University several weeks ago was
this question: "What is a market economy?" To which he answered, quite
idiomatically, "Oh, wow." A portion of his lecture had distinguished
between the regulated market economy of the European Union compared to
the unregulated market economy of the United States.

The German poet, Rainer Maria Rilke, once wrote about "the appearance
of things which bear down from America," though it is a sign of the
times that I know this quotation only in translation. Internet
technology and its role in the rapid expansion of English as an
International Language cannot be ignored, though it is just as
difficult to find words adequate to the overwhelming reality of the
many and manifold representations of information, knowledge, science
and culture transmitted there. In the field of language and culture
studies, The University of Michigan and the University of Virginia are
two examples among many institutions in the United States which charge
an expensive subscription fee to access their archives. The internet
has not made knowledge free, though it might be said that the internet
has made a vast amount of information widely available, especially if
the technician or researcher is fortunate enough to have internet
access provided by the institution for which he or she works. For
example, all of the issues of the linguistic journal, "Views," which
as I mentioned is published by the University of Vienna, is available
for free in pdf format, though it is also published in book form for
university libraries. I think this is an important model for teachers,
writers, researchers and technicians in the emerging global space. For
many writers from my generation who had to learn the internet like a
second language after we left school, the internet represents the
promise of a Public Domain or Digital Commons, and we publish our work
without payment, wishing to give away our work in recognition of the
immense economic advantage and social privilege we enjoy for one very
complex historical reason or another. Yes, our work is creative, and
its value is never transparent, unlike the value of advances in the
sciences and especially in technology, where we are always reminded of
the competition which exists between nations. If the emerging global
space increases the possibility of scientific and cultural exchanges
among open societies, it is also important to remember that this
space has more than one dimension, though it may often appear to be
monolingual. Perhaps it is best to think of this space in the plural
form or multidimensionality of electronic communications
networks. When I think of the synchronic approach to language study in
Russia, the close attention to linguistics and the scientific
objectification of language, one of the great accomplishments of her
universities in the 20th century, and compare it to the diachrony of
internet communications, which motivated a French scholar in 1995 to
say in a lecture at the University of California at Berkeley, "We are
losing time," I am encouraged to believe that the further growth,
development and stability of the world's intellectual and scientific
cultures and the institutions which communicate this knowledge to the
younger generation which, unlike my generation, is global in its
perspective and expectations for the future, depends on reciprocal and
equal exchanges. Speaking to you today as a teacher of English who
also writes poetry, or as a poet who teaches English to pay the rent,
as we say, colloquially, to express the sense of the necessity of
making a simple living, working with others for equality of
opportunity in the emerging global space, I would like to conclude by
saying that the international or multinational wealth of scientific
and cultural research and the technical application of the applied
sciences should be used productively and peacefully to advance the
material living conditions for people around the world. This is how I
interpret the title of this conference: "Progressive Technologies and
Economy in Mechanical Engineering."

Thank you again for inviting a foreigner to speak in English at your
conference.

Susan,

Thank you very much, and thanks to others who helped.  Here's what I
have so far, by way of negative Ashbery criticism (If I missed
someone's suggestion, please let me know):

Also, thanks to Jeffrey Jullich, who reminded me of Kermani's

And now I'm using it.

The Marianne Moore review appears in the Complete Prose of Marianne Moore (NY:
Penguin, 1987) 535-539.  She briefly discusses Spicer, Kirby Doyle, Schuyler,
Ferlinghetti, O'Hara, Charles Olson, Ed Dorn, -- usually in a one-line
comment.  I found it mostly positive though I imagine one could say she is
damning with faint praise.  She has only one sentence on Ashbery, which appears
on p. 538.  "John Ashbery's 'Instruction Manual' also is a pleasure [she has
just praised O'Hara], a documentary with structure and content."

She says that the new poetry has a hard task to compete with the new
vocabularies of science, which she calls "enthralling," and her main criticism
is that the article "The" should have been taken off the title of Allen's
anthology, and the book called "New American Poetry," because it leaves out
such interesting new poets [to her] as Daniel Hoffman, Robert Bagg, and George
Starbuck.

At any rate, Marianne Moore wouldn't be able to complain much about
obscurantism.  She's as tough to read as any.  Even in this she appears to be
saying something in her last paragraphs about the squalor of writing about drug
addiction and what actually calls "civic parasites" seems to be an indictment,
but this seems to be a general comment, and she's too politic to attack anyone
directly.  But I've always appreciated her high praise of Corso (even though he
was both a drug addict and what I suppose could be called a civic parasite,
whatever she meant by that).  She cites a quatrain, and says he has
"vehemence," among other nice things.  She especially seems to enjoy Charles
Olson, though she tries to link his poetics to older formulations propounded by
her great friend Kenneth Burke -- who lived to be 95 or something.

Btw. Can anybody think of an important American modernist who attained the age
of a 100 or more?  There's Ernst Junger in Germany.  Soupault got to be 92
among the French surrealists.  Pierre Klossowski was 95.  Moore was I think
only 85 or so.  Painters seem to last longer than writers.  Balthus was in his
nineties, as was Picasso.  But very few seem to last past 100.  Bob Hope and
Irving Berlin, yes, but what about American poets?  Who got to be oldest?

Carl Rakowski is either 99 or 100. He and his wife - who's name momentarily
eludes me - recently came to hear Joanne Kyger and Anselm Hollo read on a
Saturday evening for the SF Poetry Center. Perhaps two years ago Carl gave a
Poetry Center reading standing up for a straight ahead 45 minutes, only
occasionally slipping over a word.
A curious anecdote - for no obvious reasons of kinship - Rakowski, Jack
Gilbert, Jack Marshall and I all share the same dentist in San Francisco,
Dr. Richard Rosen, who also writes and paints. His abstractions - full of
Diebenkorn California colors - sitting there in the dentist chair always
seem to share the shapes of molars, upper and lower, vertically facing off
each other. Next time I see Rosen I will ask if he's using x-rays as formal
source material for his paintings, and might they be those of any of us
poets, particularly Rakowski. I guess that's a modernist critical question -
sources of 'oral geography', 'physiographic reference', all of which may
contribute to know why Rakowski has such staying power! Or maybe that
question should be left to the gods!

Modernist or not - I like to read him in small doses - Stanley Kunitz is
still operative and certainly in his nineties.

Bob Hass says Kunitz is 100, born in 1903.  So he's just a teensy bit older
than Rakosi.  We had a conversation on the street  in Berkeley yesterday
about this very thing.

Kunitz was born in 1905.

I can't imagine what it is like to outlive and outlive
and outlive. Once I was looking at an anthology which
was listed chronologically and noticing how near the
beginning (an anothology of contemporary poetry)
Kunitz was; how many who were born after him--decades
after sometimes--and who are gone.

It also affect the sense of "contemporary": James
Wright, Hans Hofmann, Anais Nin, Mark Rothko were all
younger than or contemporary with Kunitz yet each
seems so much a part of the past--

THE KELLY WRITERS HOUSE HAS A NEW DIRECTOR
------------------------------------------

It gives me great pleasure to announce that as of July 1, 2003, the Director
of the Kelly Writers House will be Dr. JENNIFER SNEAD.

Jennifer succeeds Dr. Kerry Sherin Wright in the directorship; Kerry joined
the Writers House staff in 1997, and as of July 1, 2003, will continue as a
member of the Writers House community, serving as Senior Advisor at the
Writers House, Lecturer in Critical and Creative Writing, and Associate
Fellow at the new Center for Programs in Contemporary Writing.

Jennifer Snead is a poet, scholar, and teacher. She has a Ph.D. in English
from Duke University, where she taught writing and literature and trained
teachers of writing. She has been a lecturer on the faculty of English here
at Penn since 2000, teaching courses in poetry and poetics, the novel, and
creative writing. Her areas of interest as a writer and scholar include
18th-century print culture, history and contemporary culture of the book,
science fiction and fantasy writing, and poetry and poetics.

She is just completing a term as a Mellon Postdoctoral Fellow at the Penn
Humanities Forum. At Penn she has also been the Assistant Program
Coordinator at the Kelly Writers House, and a Research Associate for the
School of Arts & Sciences Office of External Affairs.

Jennifer is also an alumna of Penn's College of Arts & Sciences. When she
took her BA in 1994 in English with a concentration in Creative Writing, she
received the Haney Prize for the years' finest Senior Honors Thesis, and was
twice awarded the College Alumni Society Prize for Penn's best undergraduate
poet. (One year Jennifer took second in this contest; the winner was Shawn
Lynn Walker, who then became a founder and the first Resident Coordinator of
the Writers House.)

Closely affiliated with the House since returning to Philadelphia in 2000 as
a member of the Writers House volunteer collaborative planning committee (or
"hub"), Jennifer has conceived and organized a variety of projects and
programs, including "Fringing the Page," a one-day conference on
Philadelphia poetry to coincide with the Philly Fringe Festival, and a
recent Documentary Workshop featuring film-maker Greg Matkosky. She has also
read her poems on "Live at the Writers House," the one-hour radio program
broadcast in collaboration with WXPN.

When offered the Writers House directorship by a 10-person hiring committee
of Writers House-affiliated students, faculty, Penn staff, and alumni,
Jennifer said: "I'm thrilled and awed to have the opportunity to lead this
extrordinary writing community. I found a home at the Writers House when I
returned to Penn, and I can't wait to be able to take good care of it as it
has taken such good care of me."

Found in 1995-96 by a group of intrepid writers and teachers of writing, the
Kelly Writers House is a fourteen-room Victorian cottage on Penn's campus
that is run collaboratively by its members - a stand-alone project,
unaffiliated with departments or with the for-credit curriculum, although
regularly inhabited by eminent faculty in the arts and humanities and
frequented by established writers who serve as teachers and mentors.  It is
a learning community for creative students; a reading and performance space
for local artists; an intimate, informal salon for young writers seeking a
place to gather; and a site for experimentation in the several arts related
to writing.

Hi all, big apologies for cross-posting but I wanted to get the word out that
my new book of poems _MS_ (Spuyten Duyvil) is now available at
www.barnesandnoble.com or through your local bookstore (it's up at amazon.com

******************************
Stuttering turns into syncopation in this edgily engaging collocation of
accents, attitudes, occasions. The poems in MS are provocative, certainly
without idealization, the dollars-and-cents context of our grainy American
dream. Mike Magee's  detailed optical-ocular orbiting effects  "other-wise /
waning or adroitly loitering"  make reading this collection a constant
surprise.

Susan Howe

Does the poet diagnose a medical condition or continue a feminist tradition? Is
it a motor ship or a manuscript? A degree of science or a software appliance?
Recklessly eyeballing Mike Magee's "grainy American dream," my
optic nerves jangle to the tune of jump-cut language, slurred and blurred words
flashed on the screen of memory with a quick trigger finger on the universal
remote. Magee's MS interrupts our programming with his alternative vision.

Harryette Mullen

The discursively promiscuous clauses of these poemscut generously with a
slide-wit on the national symbols blared, dice up much of the lingering prosaic
transparency of American Poetry (Inc.).  Heres no monologic gnosis gnashing of
"repressed subject" possibilities, while at the same time no fashionable
duncing of the socially determinative either. This rhetors got the apps (and
multiplexed mouth) to get you to the next levelYour Turn.

--Rodrigo Toscano

Michael Magee's MS is new music . . . a carnivalesque palimpsest of vision and
ventriloquy, supple rhythm informed by Hiphop era ironies and an erudite grasp
of postmodern poetics. This marvelous Century 21 ethnic American remix of
personal history and society's mystery is both demanding and delightful.  You
need this book!  Mr. Magee creates poems that tickle the ear and open a new
window in the mind's eye.  Read aloud.  Think fast.

It occurred to me that perhaps the original article is more biting than the
reprint in the Collected Prose?  It does appear that the last two paragraphs in
the Complete Prose are truncated or something.  It would be interesting if
someone used Maria's bibliogrpahical note to look it up and compare the two.
Maybe she said more on Ashbery or others in three.  She does have this curious
dangling sentence about sex addicts and civic parasites at the end, but it's
not clear at all from the context which of the poets she's censoring, but she
does appear to be -- although three fourths of the review in the Complete Prose
is positive, and only the ending has a kind of veiled critique in it.

"Girls are what they wear,
and boys are who they hit."

Shit not worth one dead hair.

This prescribed bloodstained valance,
It's a bullshit visaged balance,

panache-ridden parlance, barren farm passed
as palace and panacea.  See here, is this

a cobblestone on a long road to hell?
or is it the doppleganger's tryst:

dissimilarity or peaceful parity:
this is a cock here in my panties.

I'm dropping it in a deep deep well.
As it falls, such grimace of hilarity:

"Girls are what they wear,
and boys are who they hit."

Smashing girls and boys.








I don't much like it.

Against Defeat, Laughter
May Day at Kut and Kienthal
May 1, 2003

By PETER LINEBAUGH
http://www.counterpunch.org

Inasmuch as the historian's craft depends on written
records, then the answer to the question posed in the
title of V. Gordon Chile's classic book about the Tigris
and Euphrates, What Happened in History? is well answered
in the title of another classic book on the same subject
by Samuel Kramer, History Begins at Sumer, because that's
where writing began. With the American 'liberation' of
Iraq and the subsequent destruction of the library of
Baghdad and its museum of antiquities, we could say,
therefore, that history while not quite coming to an end
has become impossible to write. However, there are other
sources of knowledge of the past, such as song and story,
flora and fauna, with which we'll have to make do, not to
mention what we remember. Baghdad scholarship survived the
sacking by Genghis Khan and there is no reason to think
that it will not persist after the burning of the books by
the U.S.A.

Still...Following the planetary mobilizations of
February15 and March 22, on the one hand, and this
barbaric devastation of Iraq on the other, we don't feel
exactly like dancing around the Maypole. We need that
history which seizes hold of "a memory as it flashes up in
a moment of danger." While the storm from paradise blows
us into the future, the angel of history turns its face to
the past, commemorating, remembering: May Day and the
Haymarket hangings: May Day and the 8-hour day struggle:
the May Days of soixante-huite: May Day and the struggles
against apartheid: May Day and the central American
solidarity movement. We do not smile. While the Americans
are wrapping the cradle of civilization in its winding
sheet, the angel of history stops at May Day 1916 and the
terrible siege, surrender, and slaughter at Kut on the
Tigris river.

Every May Day story has its point, and Rosa Luxemburg
expresses mine: "The brilliant basic idea of May Day is
the autonomous, immediate stepping forward of the
proletarian masses, the political mass action of the
millions of workers," she wrote on the eve of the Great
War, and wasn't it so just last month, March 22, and the
month before, 15 February, when we millions around the
planet autonomously stepped
<http://www.counterpunch.org/linebaughhydra.jpg> forward?
And why did we autonomously step forward? Peace in Iraq.
Yet, Red Rosa said that "The direct, international mass
manifestation: the strike [was] a demonstration and means
of struggle for the eight-hour day, world peace, and
socialism." Peace, yes; but we left aside the 8-hour day
and socialism. Is that why we failed to stop the war?

In the spring of 1916 at Verdun two million men were
engaged in massive mutual holocaust; there were 676,000
losses. In Mesopotamia, tens and scores of thousands of
sepoys of the Indian Expeditionary Force 'D,' on behalf of
the British Empire, disembarked at Basra at the beginning
of the war, with the strategic objectives: 1) securing the
oil supply from Persia, 2) protecting the main corridor to
India, and 3) preventing a jihad combining Arab, Afghan,
with a rising in India. We could sum it up, as Connolly
did, "the capitalist class of Great Britain, the meanest,
most unscrupulous governing class in all history, is out
for plunder." A fourth objective emerged on the sly.
British government in India wished to annex Mesopotamia,
but British empire in London preferred to operate from its
lair in Cairo than Delhi.

The lure of Baghdad proved irresistible to General
Townshend, the commander. Foolishly (for the Persian
refineries were already secured) he led the re-named
Mesopotamian Expeditionary Force up the Tigris River
extending his lines of communication far beyond the powers
of his base to supply it with food. Repulsed before
reaching Baghdad, he was forced to retreat a hundred miles
to Kut. There followed a four months siege, a humiliating
defeat, and surrender on the eve of May first 1916.
Parallel with this narrative of disaster ran two
sub-plots, a) the soldiers' resistance, and b) the
orientalizing derring-do of Lawrence of Arabia and the
charming wiles of Gertrude Bell.

Townshend found keeping up morale "the most difficult of
all military operations" and one in which the British
soldier is "very prone to get out of hand." They arrived
and dug in at Kut after two days of forced marches, and
then suffered heat, exhaustion, floods, disease, famine.
The Indian battalions had practically become "armed
bands." The bulk of the troops were Muslim. Seditious
pamphlets in Urdu and in Hindustani tempting the troops to
rise and murder their officers, join their bothers the
Turks, who would pay them better and provide grants of
land. One sepoy did attempt to shoot his officer, several
deserted, and twelve to fourteen soldiers cut off their
trigger fingers. Many were from Punjab. Dysentery claimed
fifteen dead a day, and twenty from starvation. Townshend
complained about the "trans-border Pathans." He wanted
them returned to India. They refused to eat horseflesh,
and though he mixed Hindu and Mohammedan on picket duty
and outpost work, he could not break their solidarity.
Altogether, seventy-two deserted.

Moberly, whose three volumes on the Mesopotamian campaign
provides the official history, explained: since the
Pathans were without private property, the British promise
to assure rightful succession to their property in the
event of their being killed was without effect! Behind
this logic were imperial fears of mutiny and commonism.
Against these, terror was the traditional remedy. The Arab
inhabitants of Kut would not sell their food. Townshend
asked headquarters for gold, and explained, "I could not
flog 6,000 people into taking paper money. All I could do
was to keep them in good behavior by shooting one now and
then pour encourager les autres when spies, etc., were
caught."

Gertrude Bell was the first woman to win a First in Modern
History at Oxford. Her grandfather was a rich British
industrialist, supplying one third of British iron. She
danced, she rode horse, she spoke Arabic, quoted Milton,
archaeologically discovered cities, charmed imperious
egos. She became the silken agent of English guile.
Gertrude Bell wrote from Military Intelligence's Arab
Bureau, next to the Cairo Savoy, "It's great fun." In
Cairo Lawrence intrigued to encourage the Arab revolt
against the Ottoman Empire. Gertrude Bell was dispatched
to India. The disaster at Kut put a decided damper on its
ambitions. "I hate war; oh, and I'm so weary of it--of
war, of life," as she sighed from Basra, in March 1916
during the frightful heat. That was the month that the
British government began to pay Sharif Hussein 125,000
gold sovereigns a month, a deal she helped set up.

Gertrude dallied with Lawrence, "We have had great talks
and made vast schemes for the government of the universe.
He goes up river tomorrow, where the battle is raging
these days." A month after the surrender, indeed, the Arab
revolt began. Lawrence was able to write a scathing report
on the Indian army's operations in Mesopotamia. The
English political officer, "Cox is entirely ignorant of
Arab societies," plotted Lawrence. An obstacle to the Arab
revolt--Indian ambitions for the cradle of
civilization--had been discredited. "The most important
thing of all will be cash," quoth his instructions. In
April Lawrence was authorized to offer the Turks
1,000,000 to quit the siege of Kut, though he doubled it,
Khalil Pasha rejected it scornfully.

In March Lawrence read Coleridge, The Rime of the Ancient
Mariner, several parallels may be made--the thirst
("Water, water, everywhere/Nor any drop to drink"), the
sun, the heat, the loneliness, the guilt of the mariner
for his responsibility in the wanton murder of the crew.
What sights had Lawrence seen in Kut? Who were the
starving and wasting men? The English were from
Dorsetshire and Norfolk, depressed agricultural counties,
hardy specimens of the English proletariat whose
experience was depression. There were Punjabis, Pathans.
The Inland Water Transport Service employed in its
Mesopotamian contingents men from the British West Indies
Regiment, the Nigerian Marine Regiment, the West African
Regiment, the Coloured Section, the Egyptian Labour Corps.
Lawrence saw starve the motley international of an
imperialist army.

The many men, so beautiful!
And they all dead did lie:
And a thousand thousand slimy things
Lived on; and so did I.

Lawrence, clearly, would have his limitations as an
imperial servant: though it was oil they craved, in his
master's view empire was not slime!

February 1916 finds Gandhi speaking in Karachi. Having
returned to India the year before he vowed to be silent
for a year, and only recently had he begun to speak out.
Truth and fearlessness were his themes, as only they could
remove the demoralizing atmosphere of sycophancy and
falsity. However, these salutary results required
not--spitting. Self-restraint was the necessary condition
to national liberation, he taught, "when we conquer our
so-called conquerors." Earlier that month, however,
despite not--spitting, he created a furious row with a
speech at Benares Hindu University. "It is necessary that
our hearts have got to be touched and that our hands and
feet have got to be moved"--the doctrine of satyagraha was
activist or nothing. "In her impatience India has produced
an army of anarchists," he continued. "I myself am an
anarchist but of another type." He contrasted himself to
the anarchist terrorists responsible for the bombing
campaign which before the war had annulled the British
partition of Bengal. "I honor the anarchist for his love
of country. I honor him for his bravery in being willing
to die for his country; but I ask him: Is killing
honorable?" Just as the argument in front of the students
was promising to get interesting, Miss Annie Besant, the
English liberal, interrupted, "Please stop it." Later she
explained she had noticed the CID taking notes, "I meant
to do him a kindness and prevent the more violent
interruption which would probably have taken place, had I
remained silent." More slime.

Gandhi may have overlapped with Gertrude Bell in Karachi,
but where Gandhi derived nourishment from the people, she
pitied them: "Swollen with wind and the rank mists we
draw" is the phrase she remembers in April from Milton's
Lycidias. It is from a passage about corruption between
leaders and led which begins with what? the slime of Wolf
Blitzer from the desert? a Pentagon briefing? Ari
Fleisher?

What recks it them? What need they? They are sped;
And when they list, their lean and flashy songs
Grate on their scrannel pipes of wretched straw;
The hungry sheep look up, and are not fed,
But swoln with wind, and the rank mist they draw,
Rot inwardly, and foul contagion spread;
Besides what the grim wolf with privy paw
Daily devours apace, and nothing said.

Not a glimmer of proletarian creativity could allay the
view of people as sheep. Milton at any rate went in
dialogue with the Levellers and Diggers of his day, while
Gertrude Bell used Milton as an another code of ruling
class mutual recognition.

She did not draw the parallel to the experience which the
surgeon at Kut remembered, namely, that the cats became
bolder as food became scarcer and they began "with privy
paw" to lurk about the windows and doorways of the
surgery. Major Barber, the English saw-bones, was not
pleased by his first impression of Kut, "Approaching from
the east, almost the first thing that caught the eye was a
gibbet." He spent days with stretcher-bearers, bhisties,
and women water drawers. The soldiers called the place
"Messypot," he tells us. Night-time shelling they called
"the hate." He cursed war and the economic necessities
that bring it about. Famine advanced. Then came the
slaughter of the beasts--a thousand horses, mules, camels,
all except the officers' chargers, and Townshend's dog
whose daily walk counted among Barber's duties. He
composed a menu, reflecting the class of the rank and
file.

Sauterelles Sauts
Starlings en Canap
Filet de mule
Entrecote de Chameau

For Major Barber May Day 1916 was the arrival of the
hospital ship with jam, swag, and bubbly.

In 29 April after a siege of four and a half months
General Townshend lowered the Union Jack and burned it.
23,000 soldiers had been killed in four futile attempts to
relieve the siege; then on the eve of May Day 13,000 were
taken prisoner. "It was one of the great mistakes in
British military history," writes Barker, The Neglected
War: Mesopotamia, 1914-1918. The prisoners? Captain
Shakeshaft observed them ragged, barefooted, dying of
dysentery. "One saw British soldiers dying with a green
ooze issuing from their lips, their mouths fixed open, in
and out of which flies walked." Many were contracted to
railway construction for a German company working in
Turkey. Altogether the British empire lost 40,000
casualties, concludes Moberley.

If in America the capacity to inflict terror in Iraq while
simultaneously denying it is called Liberation, in England
it goes by The Stiff Upper Lip. Gertrude Bell and General
Townshend didn't let the side down. Despite having had her
black silk gown rifled by pilfering hands at the Delhi
P.O., she cheerfully wrote referring to the mulberries and
blossoming pomegranates, "Even Basra has a burst of glory
in April." As for General Townshend, he concluded the
Terms of Surrender with this: "Finally, I asked Khalil
Pacha to send my faithful fox-terrier "Spot" down to the
British force to my friend Sir Wilfred Peek, so that he
might reach home. He was with me in the Battles of Kurna,
he was at Ctespiphon and in the retreat, and he killed
many cats during the defense of Kut. He reached England
safely, and I met him on my return to my home in Norfolk."

Gertrude Bell would become known as "the uncrowned queen
of Iraq," after the British took Baghdad in February 1917.
She wrote in words that could come Ms. Robin Raphel,
slated to run the Iraq trade ministry, or Ms. Barbara
Bodine, awaiting her assignment in Wolfie of Arabia's
Iraq, "we shall, I trust, make it a great centre of Arab
civilization, a prosperity; that will be my job partly, I
hope, and I never lose sight of it." James Connolly
explained on St Patrick's Day 1916 "The essential meanness
of the British Empire is that it robs under the pretence
of being generous, and it enslaves under pretence of
liberating." Hence, the flash song of liberation grates on
the scrannel pipes of wretched straw which we know are
there not to sing songs but to suck up you-know-what.

In "Mesopotamia--1917" Rudyard Kipling wet his whistle,
cleared his throat of anything that might grate, and
definitely raised his voice to express grief and a very
healthy specific --class hatred:

They shall not return to us, the resolute, the young,
The eager and whole-hearted whom we gave:
But the men who left them thriftily to die in their own
dung,
Shall they come with years and honour to the grave?

Shall we only threaten and be angry for an hour?
When the storm is ended shall we find
How softly but how swiftly they have sidled back to power
By their favor and contrivance of their kind?

Mercifully, Kipling leaves God out of it. Plus, he demands
justice, not oil, to compensate for the sacrifice of the
young. Kipling told one half of the story. The other half
remains to be told. Is it too late for the Subaltern
Studies historians to recover the oral tradition of the
POWs who fled, deserted, and escaped from Kut? Some people
were ready to answer Kipling's two questions.

They met in Switzerland, a center of internationalism
(financial, artistic, and revolutionary) but unconnected
by Internet or al-Jazeera or Robert Fisk, with the
disasters between the Tigris and Euphrates. Their remedy
for war and famine which only anti-capitalist
revolutionaries can provide was offered up from the Alpine
village of Kienthal. Two such different ecologies,
different elevations, different temperatures, different
flora and fauna, at Kut and Kienthal would be hard to
imagine, and yet as human communities both in 1916
retained links with a non-industrial commons--the
booleying of the high pastures in the latter, the marsh
Arabs on their reeds and islands in the former. The
previous September anti-imperialist socialists had
secretly and bravely met at Zimmerwald. The work of such
intrepid souls as Lenin and Rosa Luxemburg resulted in the
Kienthal Manifesto of May Day 1916. The manifesto was
preceded by debate and discussion.

Rosa Luxemburg published her "Junius" pamphlet in the
spring of 1916, as if with Bechtel Corportion and Baghdad
in mind. "Business is flourishing upon the ruins. Cities
are turned to rubble, whole countries into deserts,
villages into cemeteries, whole populations into beggars
.. thus stands bourgeois society as a roaring beast, as an
orgy of anarchy, as a pestilential breath, devastating
culture and humanity." As for the proletariat, "no
pre-established schemas, no ritual that holds good at all
times shows it the path that it must travel. Historical
experience is its only teacher; its Via Dolorosa to
self-liberation is covered not only with immeasurable
suffering, but with countless mistakes."

None were bitterer than she over the betrayal of July 1914
when the so-called representatives of the European
international proletariat voted with their national
belligerents, sending millions of fellow workers to
slaughter one another. She noted that socialism is "the
first popular movement in world history that has set as
its goal, and is ordained by history, to establish a
conscious sense in the social life of man, a definite
plan, and thus, free will." But it does not fall like
manna from heaven. She posed a choice: "either the triumph
of imperialism and the destruction of all culture and, as
in ancient Rome, depopulation, desolation, degeneration, a
vast cemetery. Or, the victory of socialism, that is, the
conscious struggle of the international proletariat
against imperialism and its method: war." Amid the
slaughter of Verdun and the starvation of Kut, she
returned to an axiom of history: human beings make it, the
conscious historical action by conscious historical will.
They did not pretend that peace was patriotic, nor that
they could win without struggle.

Lenin gave a speech in Switzerland in February 1916. He
quoted The Appeal to Reason of 11 September 1915. Eugene
Debs said, "I am not a capitalist soldier; I am a
proletarian revolutionist. I do not belong to the regular
army of the plutocracy, but to the irregular army of the
people. I refuse to obey any command to fight from the
ruling class I am opposed to every war but one; I am for
that war with heart and soul, and this is the world-wide
war of the social revolution. In that war I am prepared to
fight in any way the ruling class may make necessary."
Gloden Dallas & Douglas Gill, The Unknown Army: Mutinies
in the British Army in World War I (Verso 1985) write that
a year later, also on 11 September, the English recruits
in France mutinously demonstrated. In Mesopotamia the
soldiers organized themselves to return home, when ordered
up country against the local population. One of the
veterans remembered, "We refused saying that we had not
enlisted for this purpose & as there was always trouble
there, we should have had difficulty in getting back. We
stood our ground & gained the day"

Lenin welcomed "The Junius Pamphlet," although he argued
the necessity of wars of national liberation. In Zrich
during the spring of 1916 Lenin wrote Imperialism, the
Highest Stage of Capitalism which would be used in the
anti-colonial struggles of the 20th century--China, India,
Kenya, Algeria, Vietnam. He studied the growth of
monopolies and cartels; he studied finance capital: "It
spreads its net over all countries of the world." He
observed its dynamics: 1) "the more capitalism is
developed the more desperate the struggle for raw
materials," or 2) "imperialism is, in general, a striving
towards violence and reaction." He explained how the
proletariat drew rank mist and became swollen with wind.
Super-profits from plundering colonies enabled the
metropolitan working classes to become opportunist and
susceptible to nationalist appeals, permitting the
betrayal of the trade unions and socialist parties. "It
has grown ripe, overripe, and rotten," Lenin wrote. He
noted its two fundamental weaknesses, a) it bribed its
lower class into acquiescence, and b) its armies were
recruited from subject peoples.

Lenin lived around the corner from the Caberet Voltaire
where the artists and musicians in the spring of 1916
thought up the name Dada for an art to cure the madness of
the age. Ed Sanders in volume one of his beautiful
America: A History in Verse (Black Sparrow, 2000),
described an evening there,

--a holy, mind-freeing rinse of nonsense
to laugh away
the stench of the trench
a Rinse heard as far away as
San Francisco

If theirs was the rinse, Lenin gave the scrubbing. Lenin
quoted Cecil Rhodes, "if you want to avoid civil war, you
must become imperialists." This precisely was the pivot
point: how to turn imperialist war into civil war. Here
was the transition from defense to offense. Rosa Luxemburg
too argued against the siege mentality in favor of armed,
free people on'amove. You study Lenin and Luxemburg in
that year and you do not find sectarian bitterness or the
irreconcilable differences of gender antagonism. Among the
many things Luxemburg and Lenin agreed on that year was
denunciation of the Social Democrats for refusing to
intercede on behalf of a comrade in the Cameroons who
faced a death sentence for organizing an uprising against
the war. These are comrades denouncing war, condemning
betrayal of the official opposition, analyzing
imperialism, praising the creativity of the working-class,
and they search the world to find it.

 From these discussions came the Kienthal May Day
Manifesto of 1916. If Kut describes a progenitor of our
problem, then Kinethal describes a solution. It's words
apply to us. Addressed to workers of town and country,
"You have only the right to starve and to keep silent. You
face the chains of the state of siege, the fetters of
censorship, and the stale air of the dungeon. They try to
incite you to betray your class duty and tear out of your
heart your greatest strength, your hope of socialism."

"The governments, the imperialist cliques, and their press
tell you that it is necessary to hold out in order to free
the oppressed nations. Of all the methods of deception
that have been used in this war, this is the crudest. For
some, the real aim of this universal slaughter is to
maintain what they have seized over the centuries and
conquered in many wars. Others want to divide up the world
over again, in order to increase their possessions. They
want to annex new territories, tear whole peoples apart
and degrade them to the status of common serfs and
slaves."

"Courage! Remember that you are the majority and that if
you so desire the power can be yours." By May 1916 Dubois
and James Connolly had found the desire and the courage.
It consisted of a) defense against terrorism and b)
offense against imperialism.

DuBois had recently written that "Africa is the prime
cause of this terrible overturning of civilization," World
War. He wrote "the white working man has been asked to
share the spoil of exploiting 'chinks and niggers.'"
Having invaded Haiti, Santo Domingo, Mexico, and
Nicaragua, the U.S.A. grew rank with terror and racism.
Marcus Garvey of Jamaica arrived in New York in the spring
of 1916, asking DuBois to chair his meeting. Dubois called
for a revolution, "democracy in determining income is the
next inevitable step to democracy in political power."
When the Easter rebels were called fools, DuBois appealed
to the heavens, "would to God some of us had sense enough
to be fools!" May Day at DuBois' The Crisis was entirely
occupied in the struggle against lynching. It inveighed
against the terrorism in the U.S.A. The April issue was
against the lynching of six men in Georgia, while the next
issue, on "The Waco Horror," reproduced the most searing
photographs of the century, the charred stumps of
mutilated, burned, and hanged Texas proletarians.

James Connolly reiterated, A Rich Man's War and a Poor
Man's Fight! He discovered the war profiteers. He analyzed
the economic incentives for joining up (unemployment +
cash for women who sent their husbands to war). He berated
the union bureaucrats and praised the Dublin dockers and
London seamen. He recalled British robbery of Irish common
lands, and in that stroke of genius which operates by
observing the obvious he noted that "the spirit of
adventure" must be counted a revolutionary force. He
doubted that the political leprosy of militarism could be
excised without the red tide of war. Opportunities are for
those who seize them, and so, on to Easter.

The rule of insurrection is audacity, audacity, audacity!
So, despite the capture on Sunday of Roger Casement and
the loss of the arms he was shipping from Germany, the
Easter Rising commenced anyway on Monday, 24 April 1916,
asserting the right of the men and women of Ireland to its
ownership, in the oft-reprinted proclamation. Though
crushed in less than a week, its reverberations thrilled
the oppressed from Jamaica to Bengal. In Dublin Connie
Markievicz was second-in-command at Stephen's Green. The
Easter rising seized buildings about the town which
communicated with one another by means of bicyclists. To
her disappointment she was spared execution owing to her
gender, and instead awakened on May Day in her cell at
Kilmainham Gaol to the sound of rifle reports as her
comrades were executed by firing squad. They removed her
to prison in England where she amused the bread-and-water
gang by extensively reciting from The Inferno, as well as
her own words:

Dead hearts, dead dreams, dead days of ecstasy,
Can you not live again?
Nay, for we never died

Joe Hill, the song writer, was shot on 19 November 1915.
James Larkin came over from Dublin for the funeral where
they sang his popular, "The Rebel Girl,"

There are women of many descriptions
In this queer world, as every one knows,
Some are living in beautiful mansions,
And are wearing the finest of clothes.
These are blue-blooded queens and princesses
Who have charms made of diamonds and pearls:
But the only and Thoroughbred Lady
Is the Rebel Girl.

The proletarian revolution is not the restoration of
matriarchy, though it definitely entails the defeat of
patriarchy and Hausfrauiszierung (to use the phrase of
Maria Miess). And we can easily understand, given the
leadership of the women of the planet on the great days of
February 15 and March 22, that the term 'proletarian,'
etymologically speaking, meant the women or breeders of
empire, but now taking steps to realize our planetary
power as a class.

We have looked back with the angel of history--at the low
siege, surrender, and slaughter at Kut, and at the high
Alpine manifesto of proletarian internationalism of
Kienthal, and still the wind blows us into the future,
which the ruins of the libraries of Baghdad and the
bleeding of funds for the municipal libraries in the USA,
have not yet destroyed, for we take the treasures with us.
The coincidences of May Day (Kut and Kienthal) like the
coincidences of September 11 (mutiny and terror) are not
magic, though they need to be discovered; they arise
merely from probabilities. May Day is one day in 365. 11
September is another rotation of the planet. As the earth
rotates prior to our revolution, these are the constants:
imperialism and the struggle against it, capitalism and
the struggle against it, capital punishment and the
struggle against it. Meanwhile, against the slime, Gandhi
said clean up your act.

Against the flash song, Lenin offered economic analysis.
Against terror, DuBois offered unflinching truth. Against
the swollen wind and rank mist of patriotism, Red Rosa
offered the International. Against all the odds, James
Connolly offered audacity. Against defeat, Joe Hill
offered laughter.

We learn from Franklin Rosemont's magnificent Joe Hill:
The IWW & the Making of a Revolutionary Workingclass
Counterculture (Charles Kerr, 2003) that the cremated
ashes of Joe Hill were put in envelopes and sent to every
IWW local in every country of the world --Latin America,
Asia, Africa, Europe --and were released to the breezes on
May Day 1916. For the followers of the sky-gods, Jahweh
and Allah, we laugh with Joe Hill,

You will eat, bye and bye,
In that glorious land above the sky;
Work and pray, live on hay,
You'll get pie in the sky when you die.

As for the dirt-gods, Mammon and Moloch, not having mopped
them up, we have not yet earned our laugh.

original text, Burden is a solo performance piece that examines the effects
of a horrific event, three generations later.

Cape Cod  by Beth Kurkjian

adult fears about belonging to country clubs. Inspired by pianist Glenn

Lets Go  by Jonas Oppenheim
In this timeless, timely, precisely timed piece, an impatient husband and a
weepy wife battle the clock to keep their evening plans - and their marriag=

r
and chilling glimpses up and down the space/time continuum.

Take a trip back to the storied Midwest where women will be women, men will
be trees, and other men will be catatonics, in this, a heartwarming erotic

Speech and the space that shapes the speech. Or words carefully chosen

combination? The grimness of the industrial city, 20,000 the figure
given for how many once worked there. Driven in, and driven out. The
chair of the philosophy department spoke after the foreigner (the
translator: "she referred twice to your report"), answering a question
from the floor about the bible. "Foundationalism," she said, when I
asked her about the question she'd answered, immediately locating the
"fundamentalism" as the word that might have been the word she was
searching for in another language, that other language. Both seem
entirely adequate to convey the parallel to the question I was asked
from the floor, by a professor, about the contradiction, to research
in another language--whether Japanese, German or English--one must
become bilingual, but once you begin to dream in another language,
don't you become that language? Does this question ask about the
threat of cultural assimilation, or simply remember that passage in
the Eighteenth Brumaire about learning a second language and
overcoming the memory of the native language and land? But it's only
an analogy in Marx's text for the work in the present of overcoming
the memory of the past. After listening to the words written for
Yurga, one of the teachers from the class for linguists brought
pictures, including a prison photo of her grandfather which she found
in recently opened files. It's no secret by now. Her grandfather
disappeared in 1938, and she was able to show this photograph to her
grandmother before her death. Another member of the class said then
that her grandfather had also disappeared in the same year. Both were
veterinarians, and members of the middle-class peasantry in the Volga
region. Down the street, only a few blocks away, in the park, there is
a monument over a mass grave where protestors were massacred by the
Black Hundreds. Not far away there's another place, another mass grave
where wind and rain and the land washing away eventually exposed to
local residents mounds of skeletal remains of the denounced who'd been
shot in the late 30s. A colleague remembers learning poems by
Mandelstam in her childhood from her grandmother, who recited them
from memory. There were no books available, so apparently there were
people, members of the so-called intelligentsia, who stored poems in
their head. When Nadezhda Mandelstam left Chita in 1955, according to
the journalist who interviewed residents of the city who'd known her
when she taught there, no one accompanied her to the train station (a
shocking detail which the journalist from Moscow saved for the end of
the story). There is a great distance between Tomsk and Yurga. One can
never be certain of anything, including the sound of one's own voice,
even when translated into the host language sentence by sentence, the
sound of the voice alone must be threatening to the audience hearing
only the target language. So the faces on the audience of engineers
were expressionless as they filed out of the conference room, then the
gift of a book in Russian about state property laws and economic
development, cookies and coffee and a toast with cognac, and then the
English teachers' questions about poetry and the war. About the war,
the distancing strategy of the paraphrase about
http://www.rethinkingschools.org/war and about poetry, another
paraphrase of http://www.sumlitsem.org and as in Chita, responding to
the excitement and interest of the youth in everything American,
everything Western, it would be comforting to believe in the paragraph
that concludes the Letter from Eastern Russia about translation, "the
ground for a culture of translation, etc." (Pacifist, p. 61), although
the periods of the great translations usually parallel a stable and
even expansive culture and economy. Washington's war now in Iraq puts
those who are open to Western influence and Anglo-American cultural
forms, popular to high literary, on the defensive, sharpening edges
that might otherwise appear blurred in the haze of the privatization
process. Open societies? The English-language Fellow from the U.S.
Embassy who teaches here, and a former Soros Fellow, asked his class
as a discussion question: Imagine you have the power of God and there
are three airplanes that are going to crash, but you can only save one
of them. On one flight there are three-hundred passengers from the
Middle East; on the second flight there are two-hundred Americans; and
on the third flight there are one-hundred Russians. Which flight would
you save and how can you explain your choice? Someone in very broken
English answered politely, "that is a question too terrible." Deleuze
writes of micro-fascisms.  Following him, is it possible as well to
write of micro-terrorisms?

>>             The Bush administration's refusal to allow UN

>>The most widely accepted interpretation is that the US is well

>>they continue their daunting quest.

>>             Administration leaders will not soon forgive Blix or
>>Mohamed ElBaradei, Director General of the International Atomic
>>Energy Agency, for exposing to ridicule the two main pieces of
>>"evidence" adduced by Washington late last year to support its
>>contention that Iraq had reconstituted its nuclear weapons
>>development program: (1) the forged documents purporting to show
>>that Iraq was trying to obtain uranium from Niger, and (2) the high
>>strength aluminum rods sought by Iraq that the US insisted were to
>>be used in a nuclear application. That contention was roundly
>>debunked not only by IAEA scientists but also by the international
>>engineering community.
>>
>>             The normally taciturn Blix now finds it "conspicuous"
>>that a month after the invasion of Iraq, the US search for weapons
>>of mass destruction had turned up nothing. He expressed eagerness
>>to send UN inspectors back into Iraq, but also served notice that
>>he would not allow them to be led "like dogs on a leash" by US
>>forces there.

>>             The media have raised the possibility that the US might

>>
>>             Others, taken aback by the in the in-your-face attitude
>>with which Secretary of State Colin Powell reacted both to the
>>exposure of the Niger forgery and to the requiem for the argument
>>from aluminum rods, see in that attitude a sign that the Bush

>>             1. Faked evidence was a hallmark of post-World War II

>>Arbenz, who was suspected of having Communist leanings, had tried

>>             The invasion was explained and "justified" when a cache
>>of Soviet-made weapons planted by the CIA was "discovered" on
>>Nicaragua's Atlantic coast. Washington alleged that the weapons
>>were intended to support an attempt by Arbenz to overthrow the
>>Nicaraguan government.
>>
>>             2. One of the more egregious and embarrassing uses of
>>fake material evidence occurred on the eve of the Bay of Pigs
>>fiasco in 1961, when Alabama National Guard B-26 bombers attacked a
>>Cuban Air Force base in Havana. When Cuba's UN ambassador
>>protested, US Ambassador Adlai Stevenson (himself misinformed by
>>the White House) insisted that the attacking planes were those of
>>defecting Cuban Air Force pilots.
>>
>>             Two of the aircraft were shot down in Cuba, however,
>>and others were forced to land in Miami where they could be
>>examined. When it became clear that the planes were not Cuban,
>>Washington's hand was shown and Stevenson was in high dudgeon.
>>
>>             Legends, however, seem to die more slowly than dudgeon.
>>The US government clung unconscionably long to "plausible denial"
>>regarding the B-26s. Four Alabama National Guardsmen had been
>>killed in the incident and Cuba kept trying to get the US to accept
>>their bodies. Not until 1978 did Washington agree to receive the
>>remains and give them to the families of the deceased.
>>
>>             3. The war in Vietnam is replete with examples of
>>fabrication and/or misrepresentation of intelligence to justify US
>>government policies and actions. The best-known case, of course, is
>>the infamous Tonkin Gulf incident-the one that did not happen but
>>was used by President Lyndon Johnson to strong-arm Congress into
>>giving him carte blanche for the war. Adding insult to injury, CIA
>>current intelligence analysts were forbidden to report accurately
>>on what had happened (and not happened) in the Tonkin Gulf in their
>>daily publication the next morning, on grounds that the President
>>had already decided to use the non-incident to justify launching
>>the air war that very day. The analysts were aghast when their
>>seniors explained that they had decided that they did not want to
>>"wear out their welcome at the White House."
>>
>>             More directly relevant to the current search for
>>weapons of mass destruction in Iraq is the following incident,
>>which was related to the author at the time by one of the main
>>participants. US officials running the war in Vietnam believed that
>>North Vietnamese Communist troops operating in South Vietnam were
>>supported by large, secret supply dumps across the border in
>>Cambodia. In 1968, the US military in Saigon drew up plans to raid
>>one of those suspected supply bases.
>>
>>             The colonel in charge of logistics for the raid
>>surprised other members of the raiding party by loading up large
>>amounts of North Vietnamese uniforms, weapons, communications
>>equipment, and so forth. He clearly had supplementary orders. He
>>explained to the members of his team that, since it would be
>>necessary to discover North Vietnamese supplies to justify the
>>incursion into neutral Cambodia, it behooved them to be prepared to
>>carry some back.
>>
>>             4. With William Casey at the helm of the CIA during the
>>Reagan presidency, the planting of evidence to demonstrate that
>>opponents of governments in Central America were sponsored by the
>>USSR reached new heights-or depths. The following are
>>representative examples:
>>
>>             (a) In January 1981 four dugout canoes were
>>"discovered" on a Salvadoran beach. The US claimed that the boats
>>had carried 100 armed Sandinista guerrillas from Nicaragua to
>>support leftist insurgents in El Salvador. Neither weapons nor
>>Nicaraguans traceable to the boats were ever found, but Washington
>>drew attention to the fact that the wood from which the boats were
>>made was not native to El Salvador.
>>
>>             This kind of "proof" might at first seem laughable but
>>this was no trivial matter. The Reagan administration successfully
>>used the incident to justify lifting the embargo on US arms to El
>>Salvador that President Carter had imposed after members of the
>>Salvadoran National Guard raped and murdered three US nuns and
>>their lay assistant. The names of those four women now sit atop a
>>long list of Americans and Salvadorans subsequently murdered by US
>>weapons in the hands of the National Guard in El Salvador.
>>
>>             (b) In February 1981, the State Department issued a
>>sensational "White Paper" based on alleged Salvadoran rebel
>>documents. Authored by a young, eager-to-please Foreign Service
>>officer named John Glassman, the paper depicted damning links
>>between the insurgents, Nicaragua, Cuba, and the Soviet Union. A
>>smoking gun.
>>
>>             Unfortunately for Glassman and the Reagan
>>administration, Wall Street Journal reporter Jonathan Kwitny got
>>access to the same documents and found little resemblance to what
>>was contained in Glassman's paper. Glassman admitted to Kwitny that
>>he had made up quotes and guessed at figures for the Soviet weapons
>>supposedly coming to the Salvadoran insurgents.
>>
>>             (c) Certainly among the most extraordinary attempts to
>>plant evidence was the Barry Seal affair-a complicated operation
>>designed to incriminate the Nicaraguan Sandinista government for
>>international drug trafficking. The operation began in 1982, when
>>CIA Director Casey created the position of National Intelligence
>>Officer for Narcotics. Casey's handpicked NIO wasted no time
>>telling representatives of other agencies that high priority was to
>>be given to finding evidence linking both Castro and the
>>Sandinistas to the burgeoning cocaine trade.
>>
>>             Coast Guard and Drug Enforcement Agency officers
>>protested that this might be counterproductive since Cuba was the
>>most cooperative government in the Caribbean in the fight against
>>drugs and there was no evidence showing that the Nicaraguan
>>government played any significant role. Never mind, said the NIO,
>>the task was to put black hats on our enemies.
>>
>>             In 1986 Barry Seal, a former TWA pilot who had trained
>>Nicaraguan Contra pilots in the early eighties, was facing a long
>>sentence after a federal drug conviction in Florida. Seal made his
>>way to the White House's National Security Council to make the
>>following proposition to officials there. He would fly his own
>>plane to Colombia and take delivery of cocaine. He would then make
>>an "emergency landing" in Nicaragua and make it appear that
>>Sandinista officials were aiding him in drug trafficking.
>>
>>             Seal made it clear that he would expect help with his
>>legal problems.
>>
>>             The Reagan White House jumped at the offer. Seal's
>>plane was flown to Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, where it was
>>fitted with secret cameras to enable Seal to photograph Nicaraguan
>>officials in the act of assisting him with the boxes of cocaine.
>>
>>             The operation went as planned. Seal flew to Colombia
>>and then to Nicaragua where he landed at a commercial airfield.
>>There he was met by a Nicaraguan named Federico Vaughan, who helped
>>with the offloading and reloading of boxes of cocaine and was duly
>>photographed-not very well, it turned out, because the special
>>cameras malfunctioned. Though blurred and grainy, the photos were
>>delivered to the White House, and a triumphant Ronald Reagan went
>>on national TV to show that the Sandinistas were not only
>>Communists but also criminals intent on addicting America's youth.
>>What more justification was needed for the Contra war against the
>>Sandinistas!
>>
>>             Again, the Wall Street Journal's Jonathan Kwitny played
>>the role of skunk at the picnic, pointing out substantial flaws in
>>the concocted story. Vaughan, who according to the script was an
>>assistant to Nicaraguan Interior Minister Tomas Borge, was shown
>>not to be what he claimed. Indeed, congressional investigators
>>found that the telephone number called by Seal to contact Vaughn
>>belonged to the US embassy in Managua.
>>
>>             It was yet another fiasco, and Seal paid for it with
>>his life. His Colombian drug suppliers were not amused when the
>>Reagan administration identified him publicly as a US undercover
>>agent. As he awaited trial on other narcotics charges in Louisiana,
>>Seal was ambushed and killed by four gunmen who left his body
>>riddled with 140 bullets.
>>
>>             5. Fabricated evidence also played an important role in
>>the first President Bush's attempt to secure congressional and UN
>>approval for the 1991 Gulf War.
>>
>>             (a) Few will forget the heart-rending testimony before
>>a congressional committee by the sobbing 15 year-old Kuwaiti girl
>>called Nayirah on October 10, 1990:
>>
>>             "I saw the Iraqi soldiers come into the hospital with
>>guns, and go into the room where 15 babies were in incubators. They
>>took the babies out of the incubators, took the incubators, and
>>left the babies on the cold floor to die."
>>
>>             No congressperson, no journalist took the trouble to
>>probe the identity of "Nayirah," who was said to be an escapee from
>>Kuwait but was later revealed to be the daughter of the Kuwaiti
>>ambassador in Washington. With consummate skill, the story had been
>>manufactured out of whole cloth and the 15 year-old coached by the
>>PR firm Hill & Knowlton, which has a rich history of being
>>"imbedded" in Republican administrations. Similar unsubstantiated
>>yarns made their debut several weeks later at the UN, where a team
>>of seven "witnesses," also coached by Hill & Knowlton, testified
>>about atrocities in Iraq. (It was later learned that the seven had
>>used false names.) And in an unprecedented move, the UN Security
>>Council allowed the US to show a video created by Hill & Knowlton.
>>
>>             All to good effect. The PR campaign had the desired
>>impact, and Congress voted to authorize the use of force against
>>Iraq on January 12, 1991. (The UN did so on November 29, 1990.)
>>"Nayirah's" true identity did not become known until two years
>>later. And Hill & Knowlton's coffers bulged when the proceeds
>>arrived from its billing of Kuwait.
>>
>>             Interestingly, the General Manager of Hill & Knowlton's
>>Washington, DC office at the time was a woman named Victoria
>>Clarke. She turned out to be less successful in her next job, as
>>Press Secretary for the re-election campaign of President George
>>Bush in 1992. But she is now back in her element as Assistant
>>Secretary of Defense for Public Affairs.
>>
>>             (b) There was a corollary fabrication that proved
>>equally effective in garnering support in Congress for the war
>>resolution in 1991. The White House claimed there were satellite
>>photos showing Iraqi tanks and troops massing on the borders of
>>Kuwait and Saudi Arabia, threatening to invade Saudi Arabia. This
>>fueled the campaign for war and frightened the Saudis into agreeing
>>to cooperate fully with US military forces.
>>
>>             On September 11, 1990, President George H. W. Bush,
>>addressing a joint session of Congress, claimed "120,000 Iraqi
>>troops with 850 tanks have poured into Kuwait and moved south to
>>threaten Saudi Arabia." But an enterprising journalist, Jean
>>Heller, reported in the St. Petersburg Times on January 6, 1991 (a
>>bare ten days before the Gulf War began) that commercial satellite
>>photos taken on September 11, the day the president spoke, showed
>>no sign of a massive buildup of Iraqi forces in Kuwait. When the
>>Pentagon was asked to provide evidence to support the president's
>>claim, it refused to do so-and continues to refuse to this day.
>>
>>             Interestingly, the national media in the US chose to
>>ignore Heller's story. Heller's explanation:
>>
>>             "I think part of the reason the story was ignored was
>>that it was published too close to the start of the war. Second,
>>and more importantly, I do not think that people wanted to hear

Not true.   Carl RAKOSI (someone was misspelling it) is older than Kunitz,
who is a mere 98 1/2.  Carl will be 100 in November of this year.

In fact, a couple of years ago, when I spoke to Carl on the phone, I said
there's a celebration for Kunitz at Poets House.  Carl said, "say hello to
the kid for me."  At Poets House, I conveyed the conversation to Kunitz,
who broke up into gales of laughter.

Carl, by the way, is going very strong.  Just had three poems in a recent
issue of the London Review of Books.

There was a great damning review of A Wave by Irish opinion-meister Tom
Paulin in prominent British journal Poetry Review in the eighties. He says,
if I remember correctly, that Ashbery has no ear for idiomatic
American-English (!), and accuses Ashbery-fans of willfully not seeing the
talent-nakedness of the emperor. Marvelous wrong-headed sour-grapes stuff.
Ashbery is always being damned-with-faint-praise in mainstream Brit journals
and newspaper, so at least this piece has an attitude....

the gender stereotypes the poem is setting up....

that doesn't (in intent) refer to the poem itself,
though I see how it could be read that way----I like
the poem, otherwise I would not have messed with
it...there's a great soundplay in it, and the diction
is thick and gloopy---like a new york chili
burger---tasty!!


i really liked what the poem was "saying," which is
why I interacted with it....

A Humanist's Sojourn Among Scientists

   By LEONARD CASSUTO   If academe is like a village, it's a
voluntarily segregated
   community. Most residents stay in their disciplinary
   neighborhoods and work where the surroundings are comfortable
   and familiar. Recently, however, I left my humanities
   neighborhood for an unlikely destination: A foray into
   journalism took me to the community of condensed-matter
   physics. I needed to talk to laboratory scientists about their
   work, and the prospect was intimidating.

   I was reporting on a scandal involving allegedly fabricated
   data in some influential superconductivity experiments at Bell
   Labs. A blue-ribbon panel of the elder statesmen of physics
   was investigating, and I was investigating the investigation.
   Although I'm more scientifically literate than the average
   English professor, superconductivity research is, shall we
   say, rather technical. I get the concepts, but fall short of
   understanding anything beyond them by, oh, approximately one
   bachelor's degree in physics.

   So imagine my surprise at how easy my interview subjects made
   it for me. Just about everybody I called took time to talk to
   me at length. Interview subjects ranging from assistant
   professors to Nobel Prize winners were shockingly courteous as
   I peered into an embarrassing event in their field. One of the
   first scientists I spoke to, a highly decorated nanochemist,
   confessed in the most forthright way that he felt he had been
   duped. It turned out that his candor was typical.

   But these physicists were more than helpful. They were
   downright friendly. They often had to stop to explain concepts
   that were elementary to them, but obscure to me. Though they
   were talking down to me, they made generous efforts to make it
   look like they weren't. I attribute that good feeling not to
   my own charms or journalistic skill, but rather to a sense of
   genuine collegiality toward a stranger in town.

   That collegiality extends to physicists' dealings with their
   own. One physicist told me: "The process of doing physics
   involves a lot of communication. It's highly interactive and
   collaborative. Even theorists don't write on their own."
   Indeed, all of the physicists working in a given subfield
   usually know each other.

   What about competition? When there's a well-defined scientific
   milestone, there's usually a race to reach it. The competition
   can take years, and, while it's usually cordial, it is a race.
   For example, about a dozen laboratory groups each worked for
   over 10 years to demonstrate a quantum phenomenon called the
   Bose-Einstein condensation effect. The first group to reach
   the finish line won the 2001 Nobel Prize for physics. But
   direct competition is infrequent in practice. More typically,
   there's room for everyone. Rare is the physics subfield that
   gets completely played out, and considerable rewards can come
   to scientists who build on an initial discovery by someone
   else.

   Getting funds, on the other hand, is a zero-sum game. Money is
   the lifeline of the research scientist, and there's only a
   certain amount of it available in a given area. The answer
   seems to be that physicists (and others in the hard sciences)
   have a strong faith in the peer-review system. More important,
   they trust in the evaluative process that underlies it.
   Physicists told me that peer review in the sciences has an
   ethical code built into it. There can be personality
   conflicts, of course, but the scientists share the belief that
   the peer-review system can deliver trustworthy assessments of
   their work. That enables them to relax and treat each other
   with respect.

   The peer-review system in the humanities and social sciences
   inspires no such confidence. Humanists pursue vastly different
   goals, even within the same field, and their work is
   inherently subjective. Consequently, judgment is bound to lack
   some of the concreteness that attends scientific peer review.
   Glitches in the peer-review system in physics are rare enough
   to make news -- like the story I wrote about. Humanities peer
   review gets attacked all the time. Edmund F. Byrne, an
   emeritus professor of philosophy and philanthropic studies at
   Indiana University-Purdue University at Indianapolis, recently
   wrote in The Journal of Information Ethics that peer review is
   so riddled with bias that "anyone committed to such democratic
   values as fundamental fairness, equal opportunity, and equal
   respect should have ethical concerns about the process." A
   physicist reading Byrne's article might wonder what on earth
   he is talking about.

   It's no coincidence that "softer" fields are notable for their
   social hierarchies. One of my former graduate students
   described a typical conference encounter: "the glance at the
   name tag and the look away -- 'Oh, you're nobody.'" A few
   years ago at a party, I approached a well-known member of my
   field, with whom I shared a mutual friend. He didn't even
   bother to reply after I introduced myself. I can still see his
   dismissive glance.

   I must confess that I've been guilty of such status
   consciousness myself. I recall with shame how, after one of my
   presentations, I realized that the person congratulating me
   wasn't an anonymous admirer (I'd been treating him with
   unconscious condescension), but rather the author of a book I
   admired. I think he heard the grinding of gears as I lurched
   into a more generous tone. He's been cool to me since, which
   is no more than I deserve.

   This is more than impoliteness. It's unfriendliness.
   Naturally, it's no absolute rule. I've certainly encountered
   generosity from colleagues over the years, but I find it
   significant that almost every humanist I've spoken to can
   easily summon up recollections of mean-spirited treatment at
   the hands of our own scholarly community.

   Such intramural unpleasantness is "a special result of status
   anxiety," Clare Eby, a professor of English at the University
   of Connecticut and a scholar of Thorstein Veblen (who, a
   century ago, analyzed status consciousness), recently told me.
   "What we do isn't valued by our students, the world at large,
   or even within the university," she said. Surely there's
   something to that. Humanists have long been engaged in a
   rear-guard action against students who want to know, "How is
   this going to help me get a job?" The public-sector debates
   over academic responsibility routinely target humanists, many
   of whom find themselves caricatured as radical leftists
   engaged in a seditious rebellion against Western culture.

   Setting up humanists as straw men for the fall of the Western
   world is as easy as shooting literati in a barrel. But that
   ease may result more from the form than the content of
   humanists' beliefs. In the humanities, scholars usually do
   their research alone. Scientists, on the other hand, are
   trained to work in groups. Little wonder, then, that the
   humanities now features a full-blown academic celebrity
   culture. In order for celebrities to exist, people have to be
   willing to look up as well as down -- and looking both ways
   can promote insecurity.

   There's also a certain kind of anxiety that attends the study
   of the lives and works of others. One communications professor
   explained that to me with a scientific metaphor: "Humanists
   are continually chafing over the fact that they are but
   pilgrims at the shrine of art, and they find it difficult to
   forgive not only the artists, whom they diminish by splaying
   them across the literary glass slide, but also their fellow
   scrutinizers the next microscope over." The same could apply
   to a biographer, or any scholars whose work places them in the
   position of acolyte.

   Then there's the issue of the specialist's relationship with
   the general public. One of the editors I worked with on my
   physics assignment told me repeatedly that she wanted my
   article to explain "how some of the smartest people in the
   world got hoodwinked." The smartest people in the world?
   Perhaps. But the point is that you rarely hear a historian or
   a literary critic described that way. The technical work of
   experimental physicists is inherently unapproachable, except
   by other physicists. It's the job of a popularizer to simplify
   it and open it up, and physicists know that.

   The work of a historian is to tell stories. The work of a
   literary critic is to interpret them. It's inherently
   approachable -- until recently. The last two generations have
   seen the pursuits of humanists take on their own
   quasi-scientific aspects, complete with highly technical
   jargon. Attempts to popularize have often been met with the
   special hostility that attends defense of hierarchy --
   consider the philosopher Judith Butler's assertion on the
   op-ed page of The New York Times that her ideas were so
   complex they couldn't be expressed in a way that regular
   people might understand.

   The story of the Bell Labs physics scandal initially intrigued
   me because I thought it might turn out to be a scientific
   version of the culture wars, with scientists coming under
   attack from groups that help finance them. It didn't turn out
   that way. The data turned out to be faked, the perpetrator was
   fired, and the ripples from the scandal were contained within
   the physics world. But humanists have long been embroiled in
   their own conflicts with the society that finances them -- and
   one of the reasons lies in the way that we raise roadblocks
   and bar the world from entering our neighborhood. That's the
   opposite of what we ought to be doing, and it's all the more
   shameful because humanists are in an unusual and enviable
   position: The nature of our work makes it easy to open our
   doors and share that work. We can start doing so in the
   simplest way: by being nicer.

   appeared on Salon.com, was selected for inclusion in the

Colleagues, community members, and other interested parties;

We are presenting a colloquium on "Contemporary Mexican Poetry: Two New
Anthologies" in Room 508 on the Aptos campus on Tuesday the 6th of May from
3:30 to 5:30 pm. The five writers listed with their bios below, three from
Mexico and two translator-poets from the USA, will discuss their work and
the importance of the two new anthologies: Sin puertas visibles: An
Anthology of Contemporary Poetry by Mexican Women (U. of Pittsburgh Press
2003) and Reversible Monuments: Contemporary
Mexican Poetry (Copper Canyon Press 2002). They will also read some work
from the anthologies in both Spanish and English. We will conclude with a
question & answer session, allowing the audience to contribute thoughts and
queries.=20

We will also present a reading at 7:30 that evening at the Watsonville
Community Center, 120 2nd Street, featuring the same five writers with
poems presented in both Spanish and English. This is co-sponsored by Poetry
Santa Cruz and the City of Watsonville, with financial support from
Cabrillo College Foundation, the Cabrillo Student Senate, and the BELA
Division faculty.

PLEASE, BRING YOUR CLASSES IF YOU TEACH AT THESE TIMES OR--AT LEAST--INVITE

Learn to set and print your own. This summer my friend Harold Kyle =
(letterpress and photopolymer virtuoso) will be teaching a two-day =
hand-set letterpress class in Naples, NY.  Naples is 45 min south of =
Rochester and about 1-1/2 hours from Syracuse and Buffalo. If you know =
anyone interested in taking the class he would appreciate the publicity. =


The workshop is organized by the Gell Retreat Center of Writers & Books =
(a Rochester literary organization). He notes, "The location is quiet =
and peaceful, tucked in the hills of the Finger Lakes, and a wonderful =
setting for a hand-setting type." For further information, see Poets & =
Writers, www.wab.org. The contact person for the class is Kathy =
Pottetti, kathyp@wab.org. Learn more about Boxcar Press by visiting the =

Are there any books that would detail for sophomore students how to
write 3-5 page compositions specifically about modern and contemporary
American poetry?  I have to get a book order in, but can find books
about how to do this for literature generally, but not about poetry
specifically.  Could anybody recommend something?

Gloria, Charles, others --

I teach at a small branch of SUNY in the Catskills.  Half of our
students are from outlying boroughs of New York City -- Queens,
Brooklyn, the Bronx.  Many of them have been in Rikers, etc.  They know
the city very well and are bright, but I'd say most of them haven't ever
read a book on their own.  I found this tiny anthology called Poems of
New York, selected by Elizabeth Schmidt.  The students dug reading
Ginsberg on getting mugged and Damon Runyan last year, so I've decided
to focus geographically on NYC.  But the papers weren't even papers.
They don't know what an argument is, etc.  I found this exasperating,
and odn't want the whole class to be a comp class.  I want to show them
the ropes, and then get on to reading this literature.  I learned a lot
from them -- I didn't know what a bodega was.  They all knew it was a
corner grocery.  Ginsberg limps into the corner bodega after he's
trashed on E. 10th street.  This anthology appears to have some O'Hara,
etc.

Maybe there is one small essay somewhere that provides a how-to write a
composition about a poem?

Or a very brief book?

What other literature of New York would these students like?  They
really enjoyed a book called Rikers from Black Heron Press by Paul
Volponi, about a kid who gets arrested for steering -- apparently one of
Giuliani's law -- and spends ten months waiting for trial and gets beat
up and his friends commit suicide.  The students said the novel made it
seem much too easy, but they liked this book and actually got ahead of
me in the reading of it, and everybody finished it.  This is an intro to
lit class.  I do have one or two majors, but most of these students
would rather not read.  I find poetry good because we can read it
together in class -- it's short enough.  And they get really excited
about it.

Anybody else got any ideas for this class?  I have to whip it together
this week.  I used Lopate's massive Writing New York last year, but the
students found IB Singer to be irrelevant.  To my amazement, they loved
Reznikoff, and almost all the poetry, including Whitman's Crossing
Brooklyn Ferry, but didn't respond to any of the prose except Damon
Runyan. I need to find stuff that is at street level, and yet stretches
them, and then show them how to write about it. They have almost no
academic preparation.  Of fifty students last year only two knew when
the Civil War took place (which century) and of those they were both
high school teachers on sabbatical.  When I told them this was an
important aspect of Whitman's work, they grumbled and said things like,
oh come on, this already happened.  So that gives some sense of level.
They will work, but I have to hit them just right and not exasperate
them.  Thanks for your responses, and any further ones.

-- Kirby

hi kirby, are you the kirby i knew at naropa in 1977, in larry
fagin's class?  to answer your q, try _You Hear Me?_ edited by Betsy
Franco.  it's writings and poetry by teenage boys. it's pretty cool.
some is street and some is not; all of it v effective for raising
levels of interest in reading for "this population."  there's another
one too, for girls, called Things I Have to Tell You.  they don't
then show how to write about poetry, but one impt contact is Terry
Blackhawk at Detroit's Inside Out program, a v successful writing
program for high school students.   Try Koch's Rose Where Did You Get
that Red, for ideas about how to teach writing/thinking about poetry,
though it's aimed at a much younger level of school-kid; a lot of
these things translate amazingly.  thing is, *I* don't know "how to
write a composition about a poem," and i do this for a living. is
there a format?  or do you just write what you notice, at the micro
level and at the macro level, try to make some connections between
the two levels (how does this particular phrase add to a general
sense of anger, or whatever), and then try to see what those things
might "add up to" or not (why might someone be angry? what does the
poem have to do with the world?).  that's sort of been my approach
for the last 30 years.  in writing about poetry that is.  still not
sure how to teach writing about poetry.

Kirby,

I recommend Teachers & Writers Magazine. The last several issues have had
good strategies for working with challenging populations and/or teaching the
'how to' which, as Maria indicates, is elusive and challenging. An essay by
poet Miranda Field was helpful to me, I think this came out in the Fall 2002
issue (?) Other good books, if you're reading about, thinking about and
writing about NYC might be Brenda Coultas' _A Handmade Museum_ (Coffee House
Press, 2003) lots about the Bowery in NYC. And maybe Saul Williams' _s/he
squared_ (MTV Pocket Books, 1999), Major Jackson's _Leaving Saturn_(U
Georgia Press, 2000), Thomas Sayres Ellis'_The Genuine Negro Hero_ (Kent
State Univ. Press, 2001). You might not want to use all of these books, but
maybe excerpts. Parts of WCW's _Paterson_ might work as well...

The single most effective book I've ever used in teaching is aimed at a
younger crowd, but has excellent ideas in it which I think are easily
adapted- also available from Teachers & Writers--_The Grammar of Fantasy_ by
Gianni Rodari. Rodari was an Italian Marxist, children's book author, taught
extensively. This book is filled with ideas for engaging activities to do
with students that teaches them about structure and the imagination. My copy
is all dog-eared and weary from use. One last suggestion would be Harryette
Mullen's _Sleeping with the Dictionary_ (UC Press, 2002). You could use this
in tandem with Shakespeare's sonnets, imitate her form, riff on the sonnets
in general which is lots of fun, while you're teaching the nuts and bolts of
it. I find that sonnets and hip-hop have a lot in common, especially the
cheesier lovier ones- "Shall I compare thee to a summer's day- or what?"
Students seem to get into Shakespeare in a hip-hop context. You might also
want to Google Mullen for teaching activities, she does Oulipo games with
her students initially. Here's a link:
http://www.writenet.org/poetschat/poetschat_h_mullen.html _Muse & Drudge_ by
her would also be good. Blues structures, quatrains, culture, orality, etc.

For argument, have them argue something outrageous, like abstinence, just to
go through the paces of what it takes to be compelling. I think in this
instance the doing of it is more effective than the talking about it or
reading of it. Although...you could always give them examples of argument in
popular culture, have them work to sort of autopsy the text and see what is
happening that is working- use sermons, commercials, campaign speeches, etc.
The more you can root ideas of argument in the real world, the more, uh,
*real* it seems to make it for students. Or have them argue with a poem that
really challenges them- or their complaint about Whitman- have them argue
with him across time or have them argue with you, in print, about why this
is irrelevant to be reading now.  I know, sounds tricky, but- you basically
want to teach them how to argue, right? And think more deeply about the
work.

I think your best bet is Teachers & Writers. Call them for most recent book
list: 1-888-BOOKS-TW or www.twc.org

Best of luck,

J.

a "Transitoire Observable" does not belong yet to the text. Alexandre found
the concept useful because it is clear that the text, or any other semiotic
event on screen, is relative, transient and created by a physical process.
It is not a permanent and timeless object, as, for instance, a printed text.
The term gives its place to both program and  physical processes acting in
textual construction. We insist on the link existing between the object,
which is our senses perceive, and the underlying level, which is the code at
work. He refers as well to the autonomy of processes which is more of a
global description than a textual concept, because it is operating in other
digital mediums. "

as part of a desciption of the "tansitore observable".  To me this is a good
definition of what I and others are doing or seeking in poetry as process
rather than just a text in print?

Thanks, Lewis, for the encouraging and kind words.  I was actually engorged
(heh) with the idea of flogging gender stereotypes, not reinforcing them.
Do I succeed?  I don't know, as I like to contradict myself on every surface
of my poetic "argument."  I have these radicalized beliefs, yet my poetic
sensibility, or lack thereof, forces me to challenge my own assumptions and
vibrate them against their built-in failures.  dissonance and contradiction
can be painful and beautiful at the same time, right?

the boys and girls sure are smashing (wink wink), but also "boys" and
"girls" are concepts worthy of some smashing.  (here "I" am being a "boy"
and contradicting myself--are we not who we hit?  on one level, I think,
"not at all."  and then "I" see America celebrating war and "I" think, "I
sure hope not.")

I wrote it as a harangue on these silly divides: here I am suggesting that
the operative "or" of the third to last line is deflationary, unnecessarily
reductive.  that is to say, I see neither dissimilarity nor peaceful parity
in gender variation, but then, I do see it, but because people have insisted
it is there when it very well might not be.  (I say "variation" because,
although not the perfect word either, the word is certainly an improvement
on "difference.") there are certainly more than two varieties, or three or
four, for that matter.  of that I am quite insistent.  a continuum as long
as a line of all people.  the poem resolves to what is a confrontational
image of a penis ("peaceful" resonating against "boys" who define themselves
by violent or aggressive behavior) inside what are typically considered
women's undergarments: a man (sexualized with a "cock," not merely a penis)
wearing women's underwear.  It's an easy transgender image I think, used to
simplify the "argument" with, perhaps ironically or even pathetically, a
little force.  but it can be taken quite differently, namely, as an image of
violation perhaps?

wear/hit, bloodstained valance, panache/parlance: high/low, delicate/strong
crap, is being pushed.  farm (stereotypical feminine generative
typification) but barren (the violence of men type) nursed back to health by
the feminine panacea and the masculine palace, the health and the wealth.
there are clear differences gender-wise in this language, but the more you
hear of it, the more the differences are obliterated given the right
context.

a man wearing panties is both a funny image and a serious one, at least I
hope, at the same time, an image that dangerously skirts on reinforcing
gender "difference" but beyond the image, as part of an actual "scene," its
very own appearance, and feel even, smashes the difference.  that two or
more enumerated and supposed oppositions can cohabitate quite well, that the
differences in effect reveal themselves not to be differences at all, that
the oppositions occlude our ability to include, is something I found
important enough to write about.

so yeah, I think then maybe those stereotypes are set up, but only to be
abused.  perhaps the poem fails to get this across.  i always want poems
that have dense oracular surfaces, but i am reminded that desire and
gratification of that desire are two different things.

god, I wrote "shit" twice.  eek.  not good either.  rrr.

the gender stereotypes the poem is setting up....

that doesn't (in intent) refer to the poem itself,
though I see how it could be read that way----I like
the poem, otherwise I would not have messed with
it...there's a great soundplay in it, and the diction
is thick and gloopy---like a new york chili
burger---tasty!!


i really liked what the poem was "saying," which is
why I interacted with it....

Visit me at my NEW BLOG! And make sure to leave comments for me. That's what
other blogs need -- the option to comment in the blog. It would make the
inter-blog dialogue more interesting, I think. Anyway -- this blog, this new

the concept useful because it is clear that the text, or any other semiotic

It is not a permanent and timeless object, as, for instance, a printed text.

The term gives its place to both program and  physical processes acting in

which is our senses perceive, and the underlying level, which is the code at

digital mediums. "


as part of a desciption of the "tansitore observable".  To me this is a good

definition of what I and others are doing or seeking in poetry as process

Good to see that Kant, or some facsimile, lives on.  Not to forget
impressionism.  The problem, of course, is that as soon as anything enters
the field of "observability," it is textualized.  The idea that we can
approach something before it enters the semiotic field, that we can "know" it
in any way, is interesting but no doubt misguided.  All we can do is to work
backwards from the text to what we claim is noumena.  I ain't noumena.
Whatever is without the text is utterly Other--unknowable, unobservable,
irreconcilable.  Nice idea, though.  Best, Bill

We now have confirmation that the largest Iraqi MSS collection, in
what was known as the Saddam Manuscripts Library in Baghdad, is safe.
It contains more than 40,000 Arabic, Turkish, Persian & Kurdish MSS,
including the collections formerly in the Iraq Museum as well as
many other private and mosque collections. All of them were packed
and transferred to safekeeping last winter, in anticipation of
hostilities. We know this from two highly authoritative sources:-

1. The Director of the Library, Usama Nasir al-Naqshabandi, in a
satellite phone converstion with a colleague in the Orient-Institut,
Beirut (many thanks to Wolf-Dieter Lemke for this information).

2. The Director of Research at the Iraq Museum, Donny George,
at a press conference in the British Museum in London yesterday,
which I attended. This was in response to a direct question
about the Saddam MSS Library, for which the Iraq Museum is still
ultimately responsible.

At the same time, there have been press reports that significant
parts of the collections in the National Library and archives were
also saved from the fire and looting. Early newspapers and Ottoman
cadastral registers are reported to have been transferred to safe
storage in March. But we do not know the extent of the losses to
the main printed book collections.

At breakfast this Sunday morning in a diner in Geneva, New York, the Finger
Lakes Times, Q & As section on Insight Page, D, 6 entries from the small
townsfolk in the county, and, both encouraging and discouraging, 3 staunchly
against, 1 or 2 or 3 "for" the war which is not over yet:

the first, a man (picture is supplied for each), about 55, obviously working
class (well, they/"we" all are here): "No war is a success.  There are other
ways to take care of a tyrant.  And now we'll be sinking money into that
country for years."

the second in the long, "hard left" column from top of page to bottom, an
elderly lady, about 80: "There's a long way to go before it will be a
success.  We have to be careful how we build a democracy there.  We can't
hurry or rush them.  They've never had democracy.  They're like babies and
we have to help them mature."

the third, a man, about 74: "I'd say it was a success. Although if George
Bush Sr. would have went all the way it wouldn't have been necessary. I
expected more casualties -- thank god there were so few."

the fourth, a young man, about 25, stylish goatee/mustouche and stylish
"40's look" "Ben Freidlander [Hi, Ben, good fellow] type glasses": "I don't
think it was a success.  I don't believe in war.  I'm against any war, no
matter what it's about."

the fifth, a man, about 43: "You have to stand up to an aggressor like
Saddam.  Then he's gone, the world wins.  Bush is the best president of my
lifetime."

the sixth, and last (thus, anti-war in primary first and last positions), a
women, about 25-35: "Too many soldiers died on our side for it to be a
success.  War is not an answer to anything.  Sept. 11 was awful, but two
wrongs don't make a right.  It's only going to continue: There'll be another
war, then another war and another war."

On the same front page, an excellent article by Jeri Laber, a founder of
Human Rights Watch, "Playing into Castro's hands," taken from The Washington
Post: starts off "The Cuban government recently arrested 75 nonviolent
people -- journalists and activists -- tried them in brief, closed
proceedings and gave them horrendously long sentences. . . ."  And, "among
the sentenced were the poet and journalist Raul Rivero Casteneda, 57, who
received 20 years; Hector Palacios Ruiz, 61, a political activist who
received 25 years; and two economists who both received 20 years: Oscar
Espinosa Chepe, 62 and critically ill, and the only woman, Martha Beatriz
Roque Cabello, 57, who was guilty of inviting an American diplomat to her
home.  The longest sentence, 28 years, was given to Luis Enrigue Ferrer, an
organizer from Las Tunas province for the Varela Project, a petition for
democratic reform that garnered 11,000 signatures and conjures up memories
of the dissident Charter 77 movement that ultimately prevailed in Communist
Czechoslovakia.  Cuba's turn to Stalinist terror was also dramatized on
April 11 when..."

Last week, I started writing this letter, but I haven't had the courage to
post it (or I figured I'd just put it on my blog, attribute it to one of my
"friends," Menno ter Braak or beat_read):

Anyone here have difficulty figuring out "poetically correct?"

I suppose it's a different issue for each unique consciousness.

"Politically correct" is an issue, too, though easier to resolve, I think.
It seems much easier to "be politically correct" and yet avoid reinforcing
those who would use political correctness abusively.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
-----------------------------------------------------

Does one "feed" paradigms and world views one wants to either replace, or
simply eschew, by fighting them?  If a poetry is "deconstructive" (which for
me means that it acts to show the weaknesses, hypocrisies, and limitations
of previous "forms" and "applications of language"), doesn't it nonetheless
"reinforce" those older forms because it's still foregrounding them and
because it's "(co)depending" on them?

It's difficult for me to make this clear, but I'll keep trying (crying):
When all is said and done, the L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E po "movement" will have been
responsible for having created much of everything folks are here taking
advantage of -- a very broad and active writing community, this wonderful
"centralizing" poetics forum, the opportunity for hundreds and even
thousands of otherwise "marginalized" writers/(poets) to make their (I hate
the word) "work" available and "heard" and circulated.  But must the entire
project and its various and several dozen/hundred/thousand offshoot
developments continue to depend for its functioning on a rather tedious and
apparently endlessly oppositional trope with academically sanctioned
LITerature?

I don't think I'm making myself clear.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
-----------------------------------------------------

I heard a few nights ago some folks suggesting, if not asserting, that the
current and ugly "neocon journalism" and publishing frenzy has started to
run its course, reached it pinnacles, begun to merely repeat itself, and so
"the bubble" will break sometime soon.  I.e., all the popularity of the
O'Reillys, the Hannitys, the Savages, and the rest who have seen such a huge
surge/spike in popularity, book sales, and attention has started to reach
redundancy and may finally start to ebb and dissipate.  Notwithstanding the
fact that they've already done a lot of their damage and accomplished a lot
of their ends, this is obviously a good thing.  I hope it's true.  I won't
have to go to all the Barnes and Nobles Books and Borders Books in western
New York and hide the O'Reilly and Savage books in the sexual politics
sections, or turn their front covers upside down and backwards so that no
one can find them or squirt them with skunk piss or foment any of the other
more mischievous and criminal acts I contemplate in my more paranoid moods.

Had "political correctness" reached it critical mass and finally started to
burst just prior to the advent of the "neocon"
publishing/marketing/mindshaping coup?

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------

My own favorite American poet, at least for the last 18 years (before that I
read mostly prose/philosophy/psychology/sociology), has always been Ron
Silliman.  (Yes, a male -- though I don't believe anyone here would deny the
broad sweep, the prolific output, or the leadership and influence of Ron's
life project -- and perhaps it is good that later in life I would list two
females as favorites in other intellectual pursuits, Nancy Chodorow and
Riane Eisler.)  But what I am leading up to in mentioning Ron is this:
"Forever and very industriously and at least in the first 10-15 years
shrewdly 'opposing' experimental poetry, including Lang Po, as alternative
to "mainstream" and "academic" and "traditional" and "capitalist" verse/Lit
still fits into a more "male" originated (Freudian Oedipal "kill the
father") art promotion methodology.  By doing this, something for which many
are genuinely grateful and some are also sometimes confused and
"resentiment-ful," isn't there a risk of reinforcing the same male-order
methods a lot of the poetry decries?  Or something like that?

I still know that I will never quite make these sentiments (and
resentiments) clear...

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
-----------------------------------------------------

I mean no offense.  I do not desire to get attention, nor in this way.  And
I share this long, longing 'plaint fully aware of the naivete it exhibits,
vulnerably, but not like a lamb.

And then today after breakfast I wrote:

Take one

Take one metonym b4 bedtime
and call your doctor if the sore
doesn't go away by morning  [though I wrote that line last]

And like "I" should
give a fuck
about the history manufacturers
who would subsume all
avant-garde under the aegis
of Gang-po

or beat_read, who
wrote but a hundredth
of the letters his GX christian [orginally Christian] betters
zipped off to the waxworks jobs
in Washington to protest
everything un-American
about selling out
to the Communist Chinese
hypocrisy

Oh, Hypocrisy, thy name
is Not

the white male
distraught, forlorn, abandoned
who fights, who fought
forever the white male order
for feminists
like himself [orginally no linebreak after "feminists"]

for the principle,
though Principles kill
in the indifference
to hatred, Hatred
which is so necessary
yet misunderstood

How about Silliman,
for example, [originally no comma, fwiw...]
who always fought
the bullies of the school
yard or the pen
even when war
itself is wrong on the face
of it, more male
order

        Or what?
Not this, not that
("when will you read
more females not
the Bob Perelman or
Michael Palmer on your nightstand by the bed
no matter how completely good
he is?")

But fighting the bullies
still valorizes fighting
if identity is that which opposes
to become more history

as if Language Poetry
is the entire sweep from
1970 to 1990 and there are not others
living through those years

What, then?  Abandon everything
that isn't impersonal,

Bury the autobiography unless
it's a function of one man's
I mean one aesthetic's marketing

"You deteriorate now, start to,
anyhow, give in to that singular"

whereas this was so much better
before it had to be poemed
Now you look at yourself and
separate subject and object
concept and reality, the self-
reflexive from the screaming animal
without a brain
the writing from the being
the ink from the bleeding
fucking self-consciousness
what's automatic from what's
automatic               humor
from trope from the four humours from

Bullshit.

I hate more than speech.  I hate
the entire language
of poetry and literary history
and reality and everything else
that is inhuman, that is
that only exists on paper.

Period.  Stop it, Lyn Hejinian!
I love you,
but stop it, Please!  You're killing
me with your humour, which is
abundant, but I want to stop
the writing, stop this writing here,
for example, for stopping, too, is human
and how can I go on if I must
exterminate all of my life and closure?
Please!  Stop!

I just want to thank everybody who helped me with the problem of teaching young
writers to work with poetry.

I hope more ideas will continue to come in.  I hadn't thought of most of these
ideas -- Teachers & Writers, having them read their peers rather than just great
poets, have them dialogue across the ages with Whitman telling him to cork it,
please -- all these sound like fun ideas.  Arguing for abstinence will no doubt
be a riot.

I have a lot of work to do looking this stuff up, and seeing if I think it will
fly with this population.

Just learned that the great Algerian poet and novelist Mohammed Dib
(born in Tlemcen in 1920) died on Friday at the age of 82. Based in
France since the fifties, Dib was a prolific writer of poetry, novels
and plays (his French publisher is in the process of reprinting 22 of
his best known books) We could use a translation of hias first great
trilogy  set in Algeria: _La Grande Maison_(1951) , _ L'Incendie_
(1954) and _Le Mtier  Tisser_ (1957).  He travelled widely (stays in
Finland led him to write 3 novels set there, and a 1976 trip to L.A.
inspired him to write _L.A. Trip_  which came out earlier this year in
France). His first English language book was _Omneros_ translated by
Carool Lettieri & Paul Vangelisti  and published by The Red Hill Press
(Los Angeles, 1978). A novel, _The Savage Night _ translated by C.
Dickson is in print from Nebraska UP.

 From a recent interview in _Le Monde__: "My mental images are
elaborated through spoken Arabic, which is my mother's tongue. But this
heritage belongs to a commun mythic fund. French can be considered an
external language -- though it is in French that I learned to read --
but I created my writer's language inside that acquired language... I
am thus able to keep the ironic distance necessary for invesgations not
skwed by passion."

and the opening poem from _Omneros_:

language sovereign secret incompatible submerged in the universal wound
let my life be lost there without vindication wound let a thick wall of
dark seal and deaf dumb let no medium be able to make it understood
speech that hollows out an empty space

        memory exchanged for night
        disguising the night
        a void that is infinitely radiant

        and searches for
        some out of the way forest
        that will strike the morning
        suddenly and blind

/insights from my Buddhist + Spinoza readings:/

If you do nothing at all (the absence of work) and produce no effort at
all, then things *are* what they are (no additions).

You do not need to look at things in any 'way,' since they *are* that
way.

You do not have to try to be aware, because you already *are* aware (in
a double-aspect theory kind-of way). These things (object + subject) are
the same (one).

/insights from my Buddhist + Romantic readings:/

If you do not possess the above 'idea of unknowable,' 'idea of Other'

 - avoiding the *is* of identity
 - avoiding conceptualized ideas, names, categories

then the spontaneity of 'what is' springs out naturally. You can achieve
an awareness which is very precise and comprehensive (all-encompassing)
since it avoids 'promiscuous authorship' (Coleridge) in favor of
*disavowal* whose chief property is potential to openness.

As Susan Stewart (_Poetry and the Fate of the Senses)
points out (along with many others)
the visual is not the only sense?

Do I sense disaster in the course Bush is pursuing before I see it enacted
on my TV screen?  Does "I think I do" come only after I see it in print or
is the stench wafting over Baghdad being carried in the onslaught of viruses
filling my in box?

As far as I am aware, Buddhism does not aim/claim to 'cut water' -- it
*is* the water. This is revelation.

The point is if you abandon what you believe *a priori* (categories,
conceptualized ideas, names, etc.) going into the process and **begin
where you are,** you avoid the promiscuous tendency to get ahead of
yourself (playing smart and not being clever).

I find this message pretty consistent throughout the Buddhism I am
familiar with, Spinoza, Coleridge, (this list could go on and on...) and
is the difference between 'knowing the path' and 'walking the path,' if
you are a 'Matrix' fan.


>| Wholly unpersuasive

Again, the point is only *you* can be persuaded of something. I cannot
force you into believing one thing or another, or do things on your
behalf. Labor will be required in that you will have to endeavor NOT 'to
work towards' but accept 'what is' ("so that" ~ Pound) which is
understanding unfettered from external signals (objectivity, i.e.
reflexive knowledge).

Derek and Tom, good and interesting posts:

Is language "mediation" between "point-of-view" and "world" or (should be
and/or) does it become "world" itself?
-------------------------------------------------

Personally, I am forever frustrated and annoyed and disappointed by the
horrible discrepancy between language and "world."  I often feel/believe the
former is infinitely inferior, and little more than a chimera, if not in
fact an obstacle and curse.

At the same time, I often feel/believe my own "inferior" ability to
manipulate the mediation (or the medium) is "to blame," and that I "lack"
(which surely I do and must, I'm certain).

In addition, I Also Often feel that "the world" is not, and cannot be,
mediated without language, Ha, and then I am very happy with my using
language, regardless my "inferior" capability, for it's mine (not anyone
else's) and it's all I have, so that's good enough and must be, too).

Still, I keep longing for something that is a "mediation," I guess, formed
of language and/or formed by it, and I cannot "get to" what that
form/language/writing would be.  It seems to be nothing but a wish or
fantasy, I think.  I.e., there's no such thing; there's only the wanting it
(and I'm NOT talking about poetry -- I'm truly not) and some vague notion
that there is something, if only I could find it or figure out what it is
(principally by "doing," I guess).  "Menno ter Braak," a "friend," writes
about this as "wanting something else" (from writing, I guess -- or actually
I'm quite sure) (and he holds no great quarter with "poetry," doesn't quite
"believe in it" (or believe he's truly into it)).  He wants something else.
He doesn't know what it is.

----------------------------------------------------

For what it's worth, Derek R and Tom Bell, I'm reading this, as I write and
respond to your good posts: "This is where Piaget's idea of the semiotic
function supposing a differentiation turns out to be useful. Whereas the
items forming the sign are conceived to be clearly differentiated entities
and indeed as pertaining to different "realms" of reality, the "mental" and
the "physical" in terms of naive consciousness, the items of the context
continuously flow into each other, and are not felt to be different in
nature. Before we go on to illustrate this, two things should be noted:
First, both content and expression of the sign are actually "mental" or,
perhaps better, "intersubjective", as most linguists would insist; but we
are interested in the respect in which the sign user conceive them to be
different. In the second place, Piaget's notion of differentiation is vague,
and in fact multiply ambiguous, but, on the basis of his examples, I have
introduced two interpretations for it: first, the sign user's idea of the
items pertaining to different basic categories of the common sense
Lifeworld; and, in the second place, the impossibility of one of them going
over into the other, following the flow of time or an extension in space"
(Goren Sonesson, "The semiotic function and the genesis of pictorial
meaning," http://www.arthist.lu.se/kultsem/sonesson/ImatraCourseTx1.html).
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Also, fwiw, personally I have not found anything in life, not really
writing, anyway, exactly (not exactly, anyway) that compares with "the
discipline" of "hitting golf balls, solitary (narcissistically, I'm sure),
for hours on end on a driving range, knowing no one there," with no care in
the world, really, of "improving" or "preparing" (though that is the
ostensible reason for "practicing"), except it's completely "an end in
itself."  The point is that it is "a discipline," too, so it could be
anything else for others, including poets/writers for whom the actual
writing itself is quite enough -- and "what it produces" is NOT the object;
it is an end in itself.  Anyhow, that discipline of hitting golf balls is
for me the archetypal difference between "the world" and "writing."  If I
had my druthers, I suppose I would prefer to die while hitting golf balls
(though I am terribly afraid it'd be while I was in a bad loop and going
through a cycle of hitting them badly -- jesus, that would suck -- and yet
the beauty of the discipline is that it doesn't matter whether one is going
through a good loop or a bad loop, for it's the process, the being lost in
it (or found?), or, rather, completely absorbed in it (where there is
neither subject nor object, perceiver nor perceived, separation from the
world), though I suppose I could say that the discipline itself is a form of
mediation.  (I don't know if I should even suppose that, or want to, and
risk blowing the discipline.)  Anyway, I'd probably prefer to die while
hitting golf balls, prefer that even to dying while having sex (with another
person, Ha)...  Or writing, maybe.  I don't know...

>"Truth needs no sign."

Somebody else wrote, "There is nothing which leads to the knowledge of
something else which may not be reduced to some species of sign." You'll
find this in a great 16th-c. treatise called _De signo_, by the Jesuit
College of Cohimbra (Portugal) -- recently translated by John P. Doyle w/
the title _The Conimbricenses: Some Questions on Signs_ (Marquette, 2001).
Spinoza knew it, and so did Charles S. Peirce. And Increase Mather!
Kick-ass book.

I'm sorry my message came off so unkindly. To each their own. If your
lifestyle allows you to do without subject/object categories, that's great.
Mine doesn't. As far as I'm concerned, epistemology is a mere sub-branch of
semiotics. Alternately, you could call semiotics epistemology's handmaiden.
But you can't call it anything without the mediation of the sign --what do
you think we're using now to talk w/ each other? And what would God use, if
he existed? Pepper spray? LRSN

Astonishing.

It is astonishing.
How or what is astonishing.
It is full of wonder, the light beyond the characters.
The characters march. For each position, another name.
For each name, another character. Everyone its own.
I can't conceive of anything else. The plasmas and fires.
The bombs and debris. It's incomprehensible.
War returns the earth to the primordial.
Enormous temperatures at the heart of bombs. Furious winds.
Nothing remains of stromatolite culture.
There are refugees. They live and wander.
Settle in deep salinity. Stare at nothing. The stars.
The moon. The vacant sun. Inconceivable, this blankness.
This blankness full of wonder. This astonishing.
The stromatolite is a character. Grounded in a pool.
Against the beach-edge. In-shore, off-shore.
I have a name and it is inconceivable. An instant.
The shortest possible time. The ephemera of transmission.
Ephemera of protocols. The chance of communication.
The imminence. It is astounding. The is.

transition saturated with no response

what good is eternal condemnation?

lingering their lives upon real

punishment in strictest confidence

the following verse discloses this arcanum to you

wouldnt it be certain kinds of changes to gain time?

cocksure apotheosis of hypax logomenon

hatched gratitude at arms length, little more than

hard luck at a loss, portentous comprehensiveness will

not answer a sharp curve / falsities just and right for love

the founder of outer darkness judiciously increased defeat

pictorial elation unwilling to lie still

pressure remained behind motion

(the only sovereignty worth having)

nostalgia an occasion for estrangement, influence ensuing merit

how little there is to see in reciprocity!

descriptions in the hope of display not a bit like parting

utterance grounds for hard cash, delighted in the way of delineation

true liability a rarity with a happy ending, slighter stillness

logic stretched to snapping, lowest emphasis wins the bid

this lump of clay a memorial to aversion

prosperous rivalry suited to coincidence

the notion of discovery is coincidence

instigation a poorer enchantment, quietude already risen

shrouds stand for vigilance, their words mixed with the wind

thru the trees, who invited me here?!

letters are squiggles imposed-upon, & language tires out sounds

the wind blows the jackals across the courtyard end over end

& overturns what is physicd or imagined

ornate endurance once and for all economizes threshold

self-sacrifice is whats going on, and no more

why were being shown any mystery is beyond me

summaries in imitation of content

they discussed the content until

mutilation is the pith of trade

plenitude an industrious miracle

gala chasm, every derivation as fire unsettled rhythm

some still stuck with folds

shake them out to exhibit equilibrium

pray allow them exact proportion

arising with simplicity, often from simplicity

I suspct this might well lead to psychosis as defined by lack of reality
contact but is also implied in the time I spent engrossed in the war via TV
I participated in recently (due out from poethia soon).

I think the need for some explanation of how 'reality' and 'fantasy' might
be connected if not through writing and the visual cogito ergo sum also
poses a dilemma for the new connectionist neutorscience being developed by
Lakoff and others (e.g., see
http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/IPRO/Summary/97abstracts/abstracts.JF.html

and
http://www.clas.ufl.edu/ipsa/journal/2001/hollan03.htm

for example
"Embedded media
Terminalized
Frag news crawls along at camel's pace under the TV picture
of....
Akbar

TV has
Crawling once more under the screen
Along the banks of the Tibris
Clouds billow over Baghdad
Phones on the cutting edge disconnect

Regarding the Pain of Others"

could be read in a 'connectionist' manner by adding up the connections there
on the screen happening to those people or it could be we in pain on the
banks of the Tibris awaiting doom?

tom bell
not yet a crazy old man
hard but not yet hardening of the

It's both and then something...We create our world; the world creates us.
We can also "step outside" this, don't you think.  Having an either...or
excludes those lovely grays...

Kirby, if I can be a late, perhaps self-serving entry to your thread and
need here, I want to suggest that an English-to-English (or
Spanish-to-Spanish, whatever) "translation exercise" is potentially a good,
possibly empowering exercise. Which is to say, provide a poem (six to nine
lines, classic or contemporary) and ask students. By translation, it can be
either a synonymatic one, in which parallel words (or synonyms), or words
with the same sounds are substituted for those in the poem. ("A rose is a
rose" becomes "A pose is a pose", etc.) Alternatively, and one that I have
done extensively in a recent body of work is to substitute opposites words,
tenses, etc. Can't think of the opposite of a rose here (!), but, an example
I give is a short poem by Fanny Howe that reversed into something entirely
new, tho still bearing an echo of its original:

(Fanny Howe's original)

Next time I'll travel by dream
Quick forward into first person.
I'' try to avoid the world
where bombs obviate everything

The twelfth century was when?

+++
(my translation)

Last time it was by heart
To be generous to them and there
To embrace everyone and the world
What a mistake

Or to come again, focus and discriminate.

+++

Hopefully that gives an idea. (The process can be as literal as word for
word, or, as in some lines, a more abstracted translation into an opposing
tone or point of view) In the teaching context (where poetry is either
claimed by classic modes of respect, (which often students translate into
potentially humiliating awe) and/ or the custom "fit or crash" hip-hop
couplet. I believe this kind of exercise is a way of getting into both how
the original poet's work is built (and concurrent respect), as well as
creating the opportunity to unbuild the poem and come up with something that
the student and can respectfully claim as his or her own. It's also helpful
as way of getting into how one may explore and interpret a poem, as in
learning how to read, be challenged and enjoy the stuff! (I don't know if
anybody else has consciously tried this exercise or written about it??)

The self-serving part is actually a plug for the new issue of Volt
(magazine)- in itself wonderful - and the inclusion of several of my Howe
"translations" though I don't reference or include her poems  - the  new
babies do, after all, have a life of their own! And those of your students,
ideally as well.

Good luck with your project.

Stephen Vincent

Hey Kirby,

You mention that you're going to focus on NYC for your class. My press, Boog
Literature, published The Portable Boog Reader in November of 2000 . It's an
instant anthology where, from first call for work to at the printer, I
gathered words from 74 different poets--each of whom resided in one of the
five boroughs--in 29 days. Too many good authors to mention them all. Here's
a link to a nice write-up that Don Riggs gave it in the Drexel Online Journal:

http://www.drexel.edu/doj/archives/2001/artrsand/theportable.asp

It's available through the fine folks at SPD, or this fine folk could hook
you up direct if you'd prefer.

Hope all is well and good luck with the class.

as ever,
David

P.S. I'm unsure if anyone mentioned the Nuyorican Anthology from a few years
back, Out Loud, if I recall the title correctly. A great book for those who
might relate more to the spoken word side of things. And also, for something
up-to-the-moment, the latest issue from any of the NYC-produced litmags,
which always feature a great selection of area writers. Lungfull's the one
that I think is the best for new/aspiring writers, because of its
playfulness, in the work and the presentation, and for the holograph original
manuscripts, which are something any writer, but especially the beginner, can
relate to as they start to write in their own notebooks.

dear m.a.g. contributors,

the spring issue of the muse apprentice guild will appear online in only
six days on may 11th - thank you to those of you who included work in
this issue and thank you again to those of you who have included your
work in previous issues of the muse apprentice guild!

the spring issue of the m.a.g. will be only the fourth issue that has
been published since the m.a.g. debuted in august 2002 - in the august
m.a.g.  there were 60 contributors - in the spring 2003 m.a.g. there are
600!

also now there are m.a.g. liaisons in 24 countries around the world who
are assisting me in presenting literary work by both critically
acclaimed and emerging writers from their respective countries - in only
nine months the little m.a.g. has become the largest international
online literary quarterly on the internet!

i look forward to celebrating with you our concerted hard work - we have
done this together - my role is essentially that of a facilitator - you
play the most crucial and demanding role by producing the extraordinary
literary work that you send me - our celebration will take place on the
first weekend in november at the university of san diego which is
sponsoring the event - the culture animal literary festival will be
streamed online and there will be shows presented by techno, ambient,
hip-hop and art-hop dj's and performers - each and every one of you is
invited - i hope to see all of you there - i will keep you updated
throughout the summer on the culture animal literary festival!

if you missed getting your work to me for the spring issue i will begin
accepting new submissions in two weeks for the summer issue which will
appear online on august 11 - the summer issue will be the first
anniversary of the muse apprentice guild - let's make it a phenomenal
edition! - if you haven't already told your literary friends about the
m.a.g. this is the time to do it!

sincerely,
august highland

THE KELLY WRITERS HOUSE HAS A NEW DIRECTOR
------------------------------------------

It gives me great pleasure to announce that as of July 1, 2003, the Director
of the Kelly Writers House will be Dr. JENNIFER SNEAD.

Jennifer succeeds Dr. Kerry Sherin Wright in the directorship; Kerry joined
the Writers House staff in 1997, and as of July 1, 2003, will continue as a
member of the Writers House community, serving as Senior Advisor at the
Writers House, Lecturer in Critical and Creative Writing, and Associate
Fellow at the new Center for Programs in Contemporary Writing.

Jennifer Snead is a poet, scholar, and teacher. She has a Ph.D. in English
from Duke University, where she taught writing and literature and trained
teachers of writing. She has been a lecturer on the faculty of English here
at Penn since 2000, teaching courses in poetry and poetics, the novel, and
creative writing. Her areas of interest as a writer and scholar include
18th-century print culture, history and contemporary culture of the book,
science fiction and fantasy writing, and poetry and poetics.

She is just completing a term as a Mellon Postdoctoral Fellow at the Penn
Humanities Forum. At Penn she has also been the Assistant Program
Coordinator at the Kelly Writers House, and a Research Associate for the
School of Arts & Sciences Office of External Affairs.

Jennifer is also an alumna of Penn's College of Arts & Sciences. When she
took her BA in 1994 in English with a concentration in Creative Writing, she
received the Haney Prize for the years' finest Senior Honors Thesis, and was
twice awarded the College Alumni Society Prize for Penn's best undergraduate
poet. (One year Jennifer took second in this contest; the winner was Shawn
Lynn Walker, who then became a founder and the first Resident Coordinator of
the Writers House.)

Closely affiliated with the House since returning to Philadelphia in 2000 as
a member of the Writers House volunteer collaborative planning committee (or
"hub"), Jennifer has conceived and organized a variety of projects and
programs, including "Fringing the Page," a one-day conference on
Philadelphia poetry to coincide with the Philly Fringe Festival, and a
recent Documentary Workshop featuring film-maker Greg Matkosky. She has also
read her poems on "Live at the Writers House," the one-hour radio program
broadcast in collaboration with WXPN.

When offered the Writers House directorship by a 10-person hiring committee
of Writers House-affiliated students, faculty, Penn staff, and alumni,
Jennifer said: "I'm thrilled and awed to have the opportunity to lead this
extrordinary writing community. I found a home at the Writers House when I
returned to Penn, and I can't wait to be able to take good care of it as it
has taken such good care of me."

Found in 1995-96 by a group of intrepid writers and teachers of writing, the
Kelly Writers House is a fourteen-room Victorian cottage on Penn's campus
that is run collaboratively by its members - a stand-alone project,
unaffiliated with departments or with the for-credit curriculum, although
regularly inhabited by eminent faculty in the arts and humanities and
frequented by established writers who serve as teachers and mentors.  It is
a learning community for creative students; a reading and performance space
for local artists; an intimate, informal salon for young writers seeking a
place to gather; and a site for experimentation in the several arts related
to writing.

contemporary women painters who are creating images of the nude female

examined, this will be the first survey of the remarkable range of work

Tom,

The article/essay at Psyart by Norm Holland is excellent and very
interesting.  I cannot comment on it right at the moment (too many things
going on at work so far today), but I hope to later when time permits,
probably on the Buf List.  Thanks for turning me onto the article.

Above the world-weary horizons
New obstacles for exchange arise
Or unfold,
O ye postmasters!

1. About the Poetics List

With the preceeding epigraph, the Poetics Listserv was founded by Charles
Bernstein in late 1993. Now in its third incarnation, the list carries
about 1000 subscribers worldwide, though all of these subscribers do not
necessarily receive messages at any given time. A good number of other
people read the Poetics List via our web archives (see web-address above).

Our aim is to support, inform, and extend those directions in poetry that
are committed to innovations, renovations, and investigations of form
and/or/as content, to the questioning of received forms and styles, and to
the creation of the otherwise unimagined, untried, unexpected, improbable,
and impossible.  We recognize that other lists may sponsor other
possibilities for exchange in this still-new medium. We request that those
participating in this forum keep in mind the specialized and focused nature
of this project, and respect our decision to operate a moderated list. For
subscription information or to contact the moderators, write to
<poetics@acsu.buffalo.edu>.

This is a private list and information about this list should not be posted
to other lists or directories of lists. The idea is to keep the list
membership to those with specific rather than general interests, and also
to keep the scale of the list relatively small and the volume manageable.
The current limits of the list are 50 messages per day, and two messages
per subscriber per day.

The Poetics List is a moderated list. Due to the high number of
subscribers, we no longer maintain the open format with which the list
began (at under 100 subscribers). The specific form of moderation that we
employ is a relatively fluid one: in most cases, messages are reviewed
after having been posted to the list, and difficulties resolved on that
basis; however, the list moderators may shift with impunity between this
and a pre-review mode which calls for all messages to be read and approved
before being forwarded to the list. We prefer to avoid this option, as it
hampers the spontaneity of discussion that we hope to promote. In addition
to these options, the list moderators may place subscribers who find
themselves unable to abide by the rules of the list under individual
review, in which case only their messages would be received for moderators'
approval before being forwarded to the list. We remain committed to this
editorial function as a defining element of the Poetics List (for further
information please see section 6 of this Welcome Message).

Those few individuals who are no longer welcome to post on this list have
forfeited that right because of their refusal to abide by list policies as
stated in this Welcome message. While we adhere to a practice of not
discussing particular cases on the list, the areas of our greatest concern
include flaming of other list subscribers, including the list owners,
and/or giving us false registration information. Please note some
individuals have publicized false accounts of the policies of the Poetics
List. We have deemed it unwise to respond directly to the flames of the
list, preferring simply to note here that the Poetics List exists to
support and encourage divergent points of view on Modern and contemporary
poetry and poetics. We are committed to do what is necessary to preserve
this space for such dialog. For this reason, the list has always been
private or moderated.

Further information on posting to the list for subscribers, publishers and
series-coordinators, see sections 5 and 6.

In addition to being archived at through the EPC (http://epc.buffalo.edu)
and at http://listserv.acsu.buffalo.edu/archives/poetics.html, some posts
to Poetics (especially reviews, obituary notices, announcements, etc.) may
also become part of specific EPC subject areas. Brief reviews of poetry
events and publications are always welcome; we also encourage posts that
announce events important to our subscribers. See section 5 for details.

----------------

2. Subscriptions

Subscriptions to the Poetics List are free of charge, but formal
registration is required. We ask that when you subscribe you provide your
full name, street address, email address, and telephone number. All posts
to the list should provide your full real name, as registered. If there is
any discrepancy between your full name as it appears in the "from" line of
the message header, please sign your post at the bottom.  PLEASE NOTE: All
subscription-related information and correspondence remains absolutely
confidential.

To subscribe to the Poetics List, please contact the moderators at the
lists' administrative address <poetics@acsu.buffalo.edu>. Your message
should include all of the required information. All other questions about
subscriptions, whether about an individual subscription or subscription
policy, should be addressed to this same administrative address.

PLEASE NOTE: IT MAY TAKE SEVERAL WEEKS TO PROCESS SUBSCRIPTION REQUESTS.

The most frequent problem with subscriptions is bounced messages. If your
system is often down or if you have a low disk quota, Poetics messages may
get bounced. Please try avoid having messages from the list returned to us.
If the problem is low disk quota, you may wish to request an increased
quota from your system administrator.  You might also consider obtaining a
commercial account. In general, if a good number of Poetics messages are
bounced from your account, your subscription to Poetics will be temporarily
suspended. If this happens, you may re-subscribe to the list by contacting
the moderators at<poetics@acsu.buffalo.edu>.

-----------------

3. Subscription Options

We encourage you to alter your subscription options via the link on the
right side of the screen at
http://listserv.acsu.buffalo.edu/archives/poetics.html.  If you would
prefer not to use the web-interface, you may also email
<listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu> the following commands:

*to receive posts in the default option (you will receive individual
postings immediately), send <listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu> this one-line
message with no "subject": set poetics nodigest

* to receive the list in digest form (you will receive the day's individual
posts in one email sent just after midnight EST), send
<listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu> this one-line message with no "subject":
set poetics digest

* to receive the list in index form (you will receive a list, without the
text of the posts, of the subjects discussed each day along with the
author's name and address and the number of lines it comprises; you can
also choose to have the index sent to you in either plain text or in HTML
format with hyperlinks), send <listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu> this one-line
message with no "subject": set poetics nohtml index  --or--  set poetics
html index

*to temporarily turn off Poetics mail send <listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu>
this one-line message with no "subject": set poetics nomail

*to reactivate Poetics mail send <listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu> this
one-line message with no "subject": set poetics mail

PLEASE NOTE: do not leave your Poetics subscription "active" if you are
going to be away for any extended period of time.  Your account may become
flooded and you may lose not only Poetics messages but other important mail.

-----------------------

4.  To Unsubscribe

To unsubscribe (or change any of your subscription options) go to the
right-hand side of the screen at
http://listserv.acsu.buffalo.edu/archives/poetics.html  You may also may
unsubscribe by sending a one-line email to <listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu>
with no "subject": unsub poetics

If you are having difficulty unsubscribing, please note: sometimes your
e-mail address may be changed slightly by your system administrator. If
this happens you will not be able to send messages to Poetics or to
unsubscribe, although you will continue to receive mail from the Poetics
List. To avoid this problem, unsub using your old address, then return to
your new address and contact the moderators at <poetics@acsu.buffalo.edu>
to resubscribe. If you find that it is not possible to unsub using your old
address, please contact the moderators at <poetics@acsu.buffalo.edu> for
assistance.

--------------------------

5.  Posting to the List

The Poetics List is a moderated list. All messages are reviewed by the
moderators in keeping with the goals of the list as articulated in this
Welcome Message (see section 1).

Please note that while this list is primarily concerned with discussions of
poetry and poetics, messages relating to politics and political activism,
film, art, media, and so forth are also welcome. Feel free to query the
list moderators if you are uncertain as to whether a message is
appropriate. All correspondence with the moderators regarding submissions
to the list remains confidential and should be directed to us at
<poetics@acsu.buffalo.edu>.

We strongly encourage subscribers to post information on publications and
reading series that they have coordinated, edited, published, or in which
they appear. Such announcements constitute a core function of this list.
Brief reviews of poetry events and publications are always welcome.

To post to the Poetics List, send your messages directly
to the list address: <poetics@listserv.buffalo.edu>

Please do not send messages intended for posting to the list to our
administrative address <poetics@acsu.buffalo.edu>

For further information on posting to the list, see section 6 below.

-------------------

6. Cautions

"Flame" messages will not be tolerated on the Poetics List. In this
category are included messages gratuitously attacking fellow listees or the
list owners, also messages designed to "waste bandwidth" or cause the list
to reach its daily limit. These messages are considered offensive and
detrimental to list discussion. Offending subscribers will be placed on
temporary review (see section 1). Repeat offenders will be removed from the
list immediately. Please do not put this policy to test.

For reasons of basic security, we do not allow pseudononymous
subscriptions.  We also discourage the sending of HTML-formatted messages
to the list. All messages intended for the Poetics List should be sent in
Text-Only format.

Please also do not send attachments or include extremely long documents
(1,000+ words) in a post.  Messages containing attachments will be presumed
to be worm- or virus-carrying and will not be forwarded to the list.

Please do not publish list postings without the express permission of the
author. Posting on the list is a form of publication. Copyright for all
material posted on Poetics remains with the author; material from this list
and its archive may not be reproduced without the author's permission,
beyond the standard rights accorded by "fair use" of published materials.

As an outside maximum, we will accept no more than 2 messages per day from
any one subscriber. Also, given that our goal is a manageable list
(manageable both for moderators and subscribers), the list accepts 50 or
fewer messages per day.

Like all systems, the listserv will sometimes be down: if you feel your
message has been delayed or lost, *please wait at least one day to see if
it shows up*, then check the archive to be sure the message is not posted
there; if you still feel there is a problem, you may wish to contact the
moderators at <poetics@acsu.buffalo.edu>.

No jazz ?

Indeed, this is the point I wish to draw attention to.

The absence of 'calling' (categories, conceptualized ideas, names, etc.)
allows you to approach something before it enters the semiotic field,
therefore encountering the thing itself (nothing added, nothing taken
away).

This oppositional to what Bill wrote:

>| The idea that we can approach something
>| before it enters the semiotic field, that we can
>| 'know' it in any way, is interesting but no doubt
>| misguided. All we can do is to work . . . .

in that we *can* 'know things' without reference to external signals
(the semiotic) and this method or 'way' of knowing is the Buddhist
'dharma,' Spinoza's double-aspect theory (really an infinite-aspect
theory), Coleridge's 'truth' (blameless style), Pound's "Presentation,
not reference," Zukofsky's indefinite article, etc., etc. ...

For a contemporary example, one need look no further than the trend in
popular television toward 'unscripted dramas' -- *which are reality* --
and understand 'a lifestyle of subject/object categories' is
inconsistent with the intelligence and expectations of today's
population who, unlike a child, does not require a stand-in like Ed
Sullivan to signify, *as mediation,*  'what is' (i.e. "This is a really
big show...").

Indeed, 'truth makes itself manifest' -- we are wise to you now
(maturity).


>| And what would God use [for
>| communication], if he existed?

In so far as truth needs no sign, God (an eternal truth) is not in need
of secondary-level devices (language, the semiotic). God *is*
communication.

To this end, it is best to remember when one speaks of God, they are in
possession of nothing but a name, (something we call God), and that this
sign (the name) is a fiction which we ourselves create.

God transcends signage (i.e. truth needs no sign, itself being manifest
--> http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=radiation )

Subject:      Re: Some more ideas for teaching focused on NYC writing
Comments: To: Boogcityny@aol.com

Dear David,

This is the sort of thing I would be interested in.  I have 50 students (two
sections) and am trying to make a good line-up, and would like to support a small
press.  The deal is the work couldn't be too experimental, or else these guys will
fall asleep.  This is my second year here so I know pretty much what I'm getting.
They will get excited if the work is sharp, exciting, and about "real" experiences
such as busses, etc.  They even liked Marianne Moore's poem "Camperdown Elm."  As
long as it's about something in their experience.  I would like them to read
Robert Caro's biography of Robert Moses but it's 1100 pages long.  No way they're
going to read that.

What I'm trying to do is connect poetry to geography.  This has of course been
done by Charles Olson, among others, but there's no way I can get them to read
Olson.  And somehow I want them to write about how their own experience connects
with poetry set in their own neighborhoods.

Although about a third of the classes are Hispanic, there are also Haitians,
Liberians, etc., and so Spanish as a control isn't a guarantee.  I get older
Russian women, all sorts of stuff.  The only constant is NYC.

Right now I'm doing for sure Poems of New York, edited by E. Schmidt, and Fruit n
Food, by a Korean writer, that sounds like a replay of Do the Right Thing -- a
fight in a Korean grocery, or a riot there.

I love the ideas of Denby's Walking in New York, etc., that I've gotten, but
another problem is xeroxing.  I can't do it.  Our budget is going to be clipped by
15%.  NY State is in huge bugetary problems which worsened after 9/11.  The state
lost 108 bllion dollars in one week, and the slide continues as businesses
relocate to less visible target cities.

I might also use Jean Craighead George's eco-book for kids -- My Side of the
Mountain.  It is set in this village, about a boy from Brooklyn who comes up to
this rural area to escape NYC for a year, and lives in a big tree and befriends a
falcon.

Any poetry that has effected public policy is of real interest to me, and possibly
to them.  At any rate, my address is Kirby Olson/ Evenden Hall 710/ SUNY-Delhi/
Delhi, NY  13753, if you or others want to send sample copies of books.  Whatever
I take I will take at least fifty copies, and the next semester another fifty if
the book works at all with the students.

I do want to support small presses, but the work has to interact well with these
specific students.  If I bore them, they will drop out, and that's a problem.
Think Damon Runyan.  That was a key text for them last year, plus Whitman, and
other graphic descriptive, witty stuff.  Thanks for your help.

-- Kirby

Hi gang. I am writing and thinking about the book
"Sappho's Gymnasium" by Olga Broumas and T Begley.
Among other things the reinvention of syntax and
grammatical structures--in a foreword the writers ask
"can there be a tense for desire? a tense for dreams?"

I am wondering if anyone has read this book, written
about this book, or knows any sources, reviews, etc of
this book.

Thanks,

Kazim Ali

Am I missing something, or did you just claim that so-called "reality TV" is
a manifestion of enlightenment?

I think you're stretching your point to try & include Pound's notion of
"presentation," Zuk's articles, etc. as examples of the pre-semiotic.
What's interesting about poetry, & work like Zuk's especially, is that it's
something that couldn't exist OUTSIDE the semiotic field.  I can't think of
a meaningful way in which you could understand it as pre- or non-semiotic.

Ditto, your comment about jazz seems to imply that you view jazz as a kind
of "purity" outside of musical structure.  Perhaps you are thinking of Cage
instead-- about which point I won't argue.  But even the most far out jazz
is based on chord changes-- pushes the limits of what you can do in those
changes, yes-- but it has a structure at its base, which (to extend your
analogy) might correspond roughly to subject/object categories in grammar.
Think of jazz musicians' use of old standards as a jumping-off point--
Coltrane's "My Favorite Things," for example.  Enlightenment in this sense
doesn't preclude realizing one's debt to those categories & structures,
though maybe it does imply making new uses of them.  For another, literary
example, look at Stein's interest in, & freedom within, grammar.

But who am I to speak of enlightenment.  Count me with Bill & Dave among the
skeptics.  I'm genuinely glad that you have found an understanding that's
meaningful for you.  I do disagree in how you apply it to poetics-- for
whatever that's worth, since neither of us are likely to persuade the other.

My latest book, Into Stillness (Station Hill Press) is due out this

-- Maria,

Yes, that would have been me.  I tried to send you an email directly to your
edu. address but it seems to bounce.

At any rate, thanks for these ideas.  Basically, I shouldn't go above about
fifty bucks for the course, or else the students will come to class without
the books, and try to skate through.  Lots of limitations here.  If you or
any of the others have read the Basketball Diaries of Jim Carroll -- could
you tell me -- this book looks good because frankly this sport is very
important in the 'hood.  They all go to Rucker Park in the summers (or most
do), and they've invited me down.  This is a famous basketball place.  My
impression from the movie was that Basketball Diaries celebrates heroin and
sex and stuff like this.  Does it offer any other redeeming values?  I'm
trying to give these kids a sense that there's another world that they could
join, or that at least exists.  So I'm looking for texts that are about/from
their world, but that also reach into other worlds -- where values like
loyalty, work ethic, kindness, appreciation of beauty, respect for one's
parents, etc., are at least mentioned.  As it is, many of our students seem
to be making a beeline for the cemetery, but they do want a way out.  I'm not
even sure what that would be, but this book Rikers, by Paul Volponi, offers
education as a way out (there's a high school in the prison, and this kid
excels, and he later becomes a teacher himself), and the students responded
to it.

Subject:      BEI DAO
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

I bought Bei Dao's ~Unlock~ (2000) yesterday.  (I
already own his ~Old Snow~ ('99) and ~At The Sky's
Edge~ ('01), and have been re-reading and re-reading
~At The Sky's Edge~ for weeks, studying Chinese in
part to read Bei Dao.)

. . . And, even before getting down into the meaning
of the poetry, I'm shocked, from the very first
character ("feng1": "wind") on, that the book is
printed in ~traditional~ characters instead of the
~simplified~ characters that the other two books were
printed in.  (All three books are printed with Chinese
originals facing English translations.)

The whole traditional/simplified ~kulturkampf~ remains
a highly charged, political divide that turns the very
orthography that any text is written in into a
political statement, basically
Taiwan-Hong-Kong/People's Republic.  So, it's no
casual or trivial decision.

I wonder what brought about this change at New
Directions and for Bei Dao. (. . . Of course, the
chronology may be somewhat different from that, since
~Sky's Edge~ was actually printed ~after~ ~Unlock.~)


(Eliot Weinberger's Afterword discusses: "some Western
critics have charged that his is a kind of airport
poetry, written for translation in an easily
digestible, international style. . . . On the other
side, there are Chinese critics who maintain that . .
. it is now deliberately difficult in order to appeal
to sophisticated Western poetry-readers.  (The
argument, again, is that he is writing for
translation.)"

(In a case like shifting from simplied to traditional
characters, both and that change represent a kind of
translation/re-translation, too: the Taiwanese I know
cannot read (all) simplified Chinese, and the people I
know from the People's Republic cannot read
traditional.

(It would seem to represent a choice of re-directing
himself away from a potential Mainland audience, his
original homeland, perhaps now given up on as a lost
hope, as his exile extends longer and more
discouragingly than he might've originally expected.
I don't know the exact demographics but I have the
impression that here in America (New York City) the
Chinese population is largely Taiwanese/Hong Kong, a
new audience of anti-Communists whom he appears to be
re-directing his poetry toward, in the most literal of
ways: sheer legibility.)

Anyone have any behind-the-scene insights into why the
difference?

All I can say is, it sounds like a good way to get your ass kicked. I think

And since you asked: no, I don't really listen to "jazz." It seems to me a

well, LA is of course a major international city

there's Beyond Baroque (Fred Dewey)
Andrew Maxwell's exceptional Dawson's series
Otis (Paul Vangelisti, MFA program)
Green Integer in new offices on Wilshire across from LACMA

reading series at LACMA (Paul Holdengraber), UCLA Hammer (Steven Yenser,
myself together with Katherine Hayles, Benjamin Weissman have series
there), UCLA Fowler, UCLA Clark Library, sometimes at Autry and Japanese
American, PSA at the Getty, at Otis, and the LA Public Library, at the
Skirball, there's a salon at USC, and a neat little conference at Loyola
Marymount

there are cool little series at the embassies and cultural institutes,
etc.,

two poetry B&N reading series which are better than usual:  poem.x at
B&N Santa Monica, Writers & Teachers at B&N Westwood

independent bookstores:  Duttons (has many readings), Book Soup (series
mostly devoted to screenwriters, authors of adapted books), Vroman's
Pasadena, etc.

LA has a local poetry scene which is very *local* and provincial and
easy to confuse with the national and international poetry that is here
and which has always been here -- Knitting Factory LA has nothing,
readings in the world class art galleries & studios are exceptionally
uneven, etc.  Check out Larry Jaffe's poetix site and writing at
about.com, Suzanne Lummis' LA Poetry Festival, NEXT online -- lists of
all the open mike nights, etc.

because the public school district is so awful, poets in the schools is
very weak;

because there are so many actors and small theatre groups, "performance
poetry" is actor poetry or what would normally be poet-friendly theatre
is often showcase or -- actually in one series and anthology -- stand up
comedy, not "performance art" as elsewhere

An opinion,

If I have led you to believe otherwise, my apologies, but what I wish to
indicate does not involve 'pre' anything -- it *is* -- there are no
stages. This, to my understanding, is consistent with what Pound,
Zukofsky, et al are saying.


>| I think you're stretching your point

Yes, indeed, extension is the point (neoteny) -- so that the limitation
of signage (categories, conceptualized ideas, names, etc.) can be
avoided.


>| Work like Zuk's...couldn't
>| exist OUTSIDE the semiotic field

It is my understanding that Zukofsky regarded his poetry as one in which
the subject loses authority and is 'unmade,' so to speak:

Zukofsky: "As a poet I have always felt that the work says all there
needs to be said of one's life."

This is an example of reflexive semiotics (objectivity) -- sign of
itself -- so that the objects presented in the work do not arrive with
any particular 'spin' on them, but instead are presented *without
quality* ('as it is') which is the practice of disavowal.

In this way, these *non-quality* things are not bound by any love (no
reference) so that -- simply -- they just exist.

For example, that which is not loved gives rise to no disputes; there
will be no sorrow if it perishes and no envy if it is possessed by
another. In short, there will be no *disturbances of the mind*
(categories, conceptualized ideas, names, etc.) so that one is free to
play with substance -- namely the text itself, the thing itself.

This is work exists OUTSIDE the imposition of semiotics (Zukofsky: "Each
word possesses objectification to a powerful degree" -- i.e. "Insight
moves sight to the site").


>| Your comment about jazz

To be truthful I don't know much about jazz but it was the only thing I
could think of to suggest spontaneity, which, to me, is freedom from the
subject/object imperative.


>| But who am I to speak of
>| enlightenment?  Count me...

Indeed.

The idea you need to be included (or counted) with some 'thing' is
subversive to enlightenment. The desire for inclusion is a material
fantasy one is compelled to, (however uncertain it might be), with all
their strength; for in it, all their hope lies.

To use a contemporary aphorism: 'Think outside the box.'

http://runme.org/project/+sondheim/  Writer Alan Sondheim mentioned in conversation about a month ago that, in the 1970s, he'd written a text program that recast the user's text as they entered it...a kind of trickster Windows Notepad. Fascinated, I immediately began working on my own version of this program.

The result is sondheim.exe, a standalone artware application written in Visual Basic that recasts your text, shuffling, scrambling, and inserting lines into it from both Alan and myself, based on an internal timer. You can configure the timer to change your text at a variety of speeds (the default is 20 seconds), choose from four different font faces, and freeze the timer to more closely examine the text. In addition to this, sondheim.exe performs the usual text editor functions--cut, copy, paste, save...

This software should work on all versions of Windows (sorry, Mac-people...)

Watch your text change as you use this strange new word processor!

This is a beta-version of this software, so new versions may become available. I would appreciate any and all feedback regarding this application. Please note that, despite the menu option, there is no user's guide as of yet---check back for future versions.

Also check out the online companion to this software, the Alan Sondheim web mix, at http://www.lewislacook.com/alanSondheim

The Rose Poets if ever asked in an interview would say that they believe
In the transcendence of nature=20
In the existence of a shadowy world that courses beneath the surface of =
this world and is only visible in the half-lights of spring and autumn
That poetry is sculpture=20
That all people, from time to time, look like Giacommetti figures
The Mormons of Utah would appreciate our work
That poetry is a blood-borne pathogen often sexually transmitted

If ever anthologized the foreword would state that The Rose Poets=20
listened to the voices in the roses that crawl up through barbed thorns =
& onto petals to be are carried off by the bees-destined to become the =
honey-tonic of this sour world=20

The Rose Poets are real We are holding casting calls right now &
We are--however unfortunate that maybe--rather serious about some of =
this

article Tom Bell has pointed out.
"And further, the brain talks to the body by means of hormones, and the body
talks back to the brain using both hormones and neurotransmitters."  I'd
like to have a talk with both of these, tell them the hormones they're
sending are the wrong kind and I'm getting a lot of spam, too.
"We hominids--our branch of the primate order, pongid family--have been
around for some five million years. But our particular species, homo sapiens
sapiens, has only been around for about a hundred thousand years."  Wow,
hard to believe we've only been around for such a short time.  Hope we
decide to stay a little longer.
"Indeed, Baldwinian evolution proceeds without any genetic mechanisms, only
a cultural differentiation in number of surviving carriers of one's genes."
Yes, poets need to learn how to compete economically.
"Baldwinian evolution may have something to say about literature. Is it
possible that people who are skilled at certain cultural activities like
dance or story-telling gain a favored position in the gene pool? Is it
possible that we have poetry and drama because the genes that give rise to
poets and actors and, indeed, appreciative audiences are specially selected
for in the world of homo sapiens sapiens? Ellen Dissanayake suggests that
the arts develop our ability to make something special, to single one thing
out from the stream of experience, and that this ability gives the arts
evolutionary value."  A lot to chew on here: (1)Is James Mark Baldwin joking
with that second sentence...  (2)I love the third sentence/question, though,
especially the part about "appreciative audiences [that] are specially
selected."  This implies (to me) that it's not just the art production; it's
much broader than that; it's the whole kit-n-kaboodle.  It's the whole
mindset that appreciates art, a mindset that requires an entire community of
contributers to pitch in.  It is "a mindset," a set (and I hope innate)
disposition to "create the art community," a community which includes
<appreciators>, without which the artforms lack proper mirrors that validate
the art or supply feedback to keep them dynamic and continually adapting.
(3)I would be more inclined to believe that the "ability to make something
special" is MORE an ability to solve social and psychosocial threats ("to
the core or essence of being" Rollo May).  I'm thinking of the theory that
"youngest siblings, for example, are statistically more inclined to be "the
creative types, artists" (and rebels) in the family."  They "must do
something creative in order to get the attention they need; eldest siblings
have already gotten their due (or been forced early into conformity) and
been handed "responsibility" and the value of conforming to the family value
system, the only one they get from the get-go, along with greater pressure
internally and externally to adhere to it, for their "identity" is
inextricably bound to that limited range of identification they've been
introduced to and nurtured by and had reflected back to them, and on which
they've learned family survival is based; middle-siblings are more social,
as they've learned to accommodate elder and younger siblings, as well as
parents, who've had to teach them to get along with more others.
Extrapolating, albeit in my usual simple-minded way, artists (perhaps
genetically predisposed) carry greater antennae for the social malaise of
their societies, including philistinism that invokes the need for newer and
more vibrant forms of art, the available forms being seen as lacking.  Or,
to solve those social problems, they are moved (perhaps genetically more
inclined to "be moved") to come up with solutions that require
"imagination."  It is this, imagination, that they are perhaps most
seriously endowed with; at the very least, it is what they most depend on.
If they had different skills, then they would use those other, different
skills (the math-minded would become a doctor to cure the disease that
killed his family, the action-type would become an athlete (20th century) or
soldier (19th and 21st), etcetera).  But it is "imagination" (which could
also be the "over-initializing" or "over-activation" of brain functioning
resulting <from not> having other skills required to solve their problems,
especially when the problems are not really solvable, given certain
sociopolitical conditions that are out-of-control); again, it is
"imagination" that they "rely on," their one and only, or their one most
reliable, or the one the external forces they are trying to change, react
to, control, survive, fight, modify can control/counteract; it is
imagination that they employ to "fight to survive" (anachronistic
terminology, incidentally, and not to blame Darwin, whose language options
were limited to it, though I would suggest that terms like "survival of the
fittest" be replaced with less "warrior mentality" jargon so that the
signified these terms point to can also evolve and then better adapt to the
changing social and political needs society must address -- I'm sure this is
not a new thought, and everyone here knows that the social Darwinists were
particularly onerous and their heirs to arrogance persist today, mucking up
the human/species/planet's potential).  I almost think/believe, Tom, that it
is "imagination" Holland and others should get a hold on.
Back to "artistic imagination," though...
"This is the basis for Chomsky's claim that we have something like eighty
switches in our brains for language, which are set this way or that by the
language environment in which we grow up. We inherit a set of linguistic
tendencies or 'principles' and a specific language experience sets the
'parameters.'"  Wow, eighty switches (and counting?)!  Really cool!  Now, I
wonder.  Is one of these 80 for metonyms and one for metaphor?  And how did
Watten and others trip the one for metonymic preferences, if so?  Moreover,
do certain socio-psychological-political-historical-aesthetic conditions
trip the prevalence (or need?) for these literary preferences?  ( I know,
that's a little bit grandiose, but I'm limited...)  Or so "conditions"
merely cause the need to create "something new," so any form that hasn't
been around for awhile will do the trick (No, I don't believe things are
"cyclical").  How can one trip the switches and check out some new ones?
Holland again, reponding to Pinker: "What, if anything, does all this have
to do with literature? It suggests that the kind of play with language that
we experience in poetry or 'musical' prose involves the brain in a different
kind of processing from the logical, step-by-step sequential processing of
language that neurology traditionally associates with the language centers
like Broca's area, Wernicke's area, and the arcuate fasciculus. This
special, 'poetic' language must jump around in our brains in unusual ways,
like a kind of exercise."  Ummm, or maybe the brain is already jumping
around, so its processing of language is different.  Or it takes greater
pleasure in the jumping around, so when it does process, and would otherwise
experience boredom (which is the opposite of pleasure, in my opinion, ummm,
my most fervent opinion), it "plays."  It creates, what, melopoeia, if
musically inclined, or the one with a lot of punning and wit and maybe
conceptual twists, or the visual one.  Those who've gotten their Pound know
better.  Here, now, I'm not sure socio-political "threats," ANXIETY, is
necessarily a precursor at all.  The play is simply for pleasure, amusement,
escape from boredom, sometimes leading to monetary award (court poets,
agrarians, rap music, et al) and/or sustenance/livelihoods.
Holland on Lakoff:  "Another group of linguists has developed yet another
claim to linguistic universal: metaphor. George Lakoff and Mark Johnson
(1980) have described metaphor as a process by which we use ideas about a
source, something that we understand pretty well, to understand a target,
something that we understand less well. The example they give (and the one
everyone uses who expounds this theory) is the metaphorical mapping, LOVE IS
A JOURNEY. From this mapping, we can generate metaphorical sentences like:
We're not getting anywhere in this relationship. This relationship is on the
rocks We've lost our way We've come to a dead end We're spinning our wheels
We're getting on swimmingly We're headed for the altar. Or that
country-and-western song, 'We're driving in the fast lane on the freeway of
love.' All of these enable us to talk about something complicated, love, in
terms of something physical and visible and well understood, getting from
here to there."  He forgot "I was born in the backseat of a rambler" and
"going all the way."  Well of course Love is a journey!  Where can I get my
drivers license renewed?
This was interesting, too: "Within this general framework of
source-to-target mapping, one can distinguish "primary" and "secondary"
metaphors. Secondary metaphors use sources from a particular culture like
our fast lanes and freeways. Primary metaphors stem from universal human
experiences, usually physical experiences, like up-down, fast-slow,
hot-cold, near-far, balance-imbalance, and so on. Primary metaphors can and
do occur in, apparently, all cultures."
And this, "If all cultures use this mapping, then this kind of metaphorical
reasoning from source to target must be wired into our brains. Neurologist
Antonio Damasio (1999, p. 347n4) has suggested that this concept of metaphor
matches his insistence on an 'embodied mind.' That is, he argues, our core
sense of self and, indeed, all our higher mental activities are based on the
representation of the body in the brain. Hence, at a deep, physiological
level, our most abstract thinking is grounded in bodily experience. In
effect, our bodies are source domains for the various target domains of our
cognitive processes. And Damasio can point to pathways in the brain that
could be the basis for this kind of hard-wired metaphorical thinking. Very
tentatively, Lakoff and his group have developed neural network simulations
that mimic the metaphorical system of traveling from here to there along a
path." At first it sounds kind of hokey, but then I think of the baby in a
womb, and the brain is getting so much input from Day One (ummm, or maybe a
few weeks later, actually) from the body and what the spinal cord takes in
and such.  So as the brain develops, it just morphs that body sensing
straight over to the way it will later learn to process language.  Do
artists, obviously then, "make things/life/theworld so much more "palpable"
and thus "relate" to the "appreciative" others that much more viscerally
(Read: intimately, at far more powerful levels of the human psyche because
tied closer to the most basically imprinted consciousness centers, or
whatever)?
All for now...  More later, maybe...
(OT: Some argue that a lot of avant garde writing is very "abstract."
Others, including the avant garde writers better readers, I think, argue
that "the abstract" is made more accessible by the better avant-garde
writers...  could be a little bit of both, too, and the real issue is how
much fuss is made about it.)

I love this...How ever did you get the format to stay in an email?  I can
never seem to do that.
What do I like?  How you can read each layer separately, together,
cross-current.  The subject matter is also appealing...

(CATALOGUE COPY...)

Historically, the "penny dreadful" was a common form of popular literature,
lavishly illustrated with garish and grotesque pictures depicting lurid
crimes and shocking romance, circulating cheaply among the lower classes in
19th century England. A century and half later, this motif is revisited
metaphorically  in Gustave Morin's  A Penny Dreadful. This time around, the
crimes remain the same but all the romance is gone.

A Penny Dreadful is a collage novel riding the coat-tails of the corpse of
cinema. It is a self-proclaimed "paper film" which goes to the edge of the
roof to expand the boundaries and expectations of what a suite of visual
texts can be. Foremost among the many concerns driving the collection is
the task of bringing the esoteric genre of the collage novel up to 21st
century standards. A project one decade in the making, A Penny Dreadful is
a large suite of works on paper that are neither literature nor graphic
art, but a hybrid of the two.

Fastidiously informed by an awareness of several marginal strains of
literary activity, A Penny Dreadful is ultimately a blueprint for
"borderblur." When the reader meanders through the nine chapters, a
veritable crazy-quilt of 20th century imagery collides with mongrel
semiotics to produce a culminative effect that is all too rare in graphic
literature. Here is a garage sale of ur-concrete, trapping many fragments
from a shattered consciousness into a jump-cut narrative about "the bad lif=
e."

A Penny Dreadful is a species of flip-book that invites multiple readings.
While no reading is definitive, one major preoccupation is with being a
newsreel of possibility for the uninitiated. A Penny Dreadful is both a
comic-book for shit-disturbers and a tour through the margins where
personal and social collapse are filtered through the lense of politcal
impotence.

160 pages, with an "appendix" by the celebrated Canadian concrete poet jwcu=
rry.

1. "A penny dreadful" was the term coined for small literary works from the
18th century that dealt most explicitly with tales of  horror, gore and
violence. Why did you choose such a title for your book?.

penny dreadfuls, or penny 'bloods' as they were called, hail from mid-19th
century england. they were slight works in terms of their literary value,
but hardly small. in fact, they were enormously popular in their day, with
a very wide circulation, and a big part of their appeal was the fact that
each issue would have a large illustration on the cover which would depict
some sordid act of violence, such as rape, mutilation or cannibalism. the
largely illiiterate 'unwashed masses' would eat this up like it was going
out of style, (though even the royalty got a guilty pleasure out of reading
them as well). they were also serialized so there was a new one every week
or so, with many publishers competing against one another, not unlike the
magazine industry of today! so every issue would re-continue the same story
that had left off the previous week at some dramatic moment in the
propulsion of the story. this is where we get the expression
'cliff-hanger'. most of those stories have since fallen to the way-side,
though quite a few still do live on. 'Robin Hood' was a penny dreadful
whose myth has obviously endured. so is 'Varney the Vampire', the original
story where Bram Stoker got most of his ideas for Dracula. 'Sawney Beane'
was another, 'Sweeney Todd, the demon Barber of Fleet Street' was another.
the list just goes on and on. Traces of this lost culture have definitely
bled over into our culture.

i chose this name for my book because i've been interested in penny
dreadfuls since i was about 10 -- i've always liked scary and demented
stories -- but also because i wanted to make a larger commentary on our
general levels of literacy, particularily in the first world, where we are
all supposed to be literate. in fact we are not. most of us read something
every day, whether its a stop sign or a horoscope, but who really has the
time for marcel proust when arnold schwartzenegger has a new multi-million
dollar movie out? our culture is increasingly becoming a purely visual one.
this is certainly not my idea, nor is it a new one. and since i've been
working with what i like to think are essentially 'literary images' -- the
book is a collection of concrete poerty -- the term 'a penny dreadful'
seemed a very appropriate way to make this commentary on our culture, the
one that places its premiums on the ease and speed of images over the
actual work that is involved with reading the short stories of Saki, to
name just one writer who has more to say than Arnold Schwartzenegger. and
though i don't own a television, everyone else does -- which further
illustrates my point. there are people in the world who would prefer to
passively watch 'the wheel of fortune' over actively reading the poetry of
Paul Celan, and that is something i can't understand. the expression also
speaks of the graphic nature of the content of my book and the bloodthirsty
pictures that were used to illustrate those original 'penny dreadful'
stories way back when.

the last point i'll make about the title of the book is that by adding an A
to the expression 'penny dreadful', i've changed its meaning. "A penny,
dreadful" is the way it should read. and this is a commentary on the
poverty of my life, thus far. whether you know it or not, artists work
harder than most people and they make less money too. that's another
imbalance in our culture that drives me nuts.

2. What were your artistic influences/inspirations in making the book?.

i don't like this question, but i'll try and answer it. the biggest
influence on my work is the life that i lead. all my work comes out of my
life, first and foremost. that is primary. the other artists and writers i
like i can list, but they don't necessarily have any bearing on this book,
or my work in general, so that won't really be helpful. as i mentioned, a
penny dreadful is a collection of concrete poetry. no one in the world even
knows what concrete poetry is, so it would be futile for me to name some of
the writers i like that have also mined this vein. (and i'm not trying to
be vague, i'm simply keeping in mind the readership of UPFRONT magazine...)
since i was a kid i've had a love / hate relationship with comics. i
similarly have a love / hate relationship to the cinema. i read everything:
poets, novelists, philosophers, social-scientists, theorists, art history,
the pulps -- really, a little bit of everything. some of my favorite global
intelligences are: jwcurry, d.a. levy, f.a.nettelbeck,
Bern Porter, Wallace Berman, Roland Topor, E.M.Cioran, Willard S. Bain,
Oyvind Fahlstrom,    Ian Hamilton Finlay, Werner Herzog, Ian Curtis,
F.W.Nietzsche, Joseph Cornell, Mark Laba, Gordon Matta-Clarke, Marcel
Duchamp, Antonin Artaud, Bill Knott, diter rot, ray johnson,     Sidney
Simes, Jess Collins, Gustave Verbeek, Ed Ruscha, Max Ernst, Goya, Ernest
Buckler jr., Alfred Jarry, B.S. Johnson, William S.Burroughs, e.e.cummings,
Northrope Frye, Thorstein Veblen, Cornell Woolrich, Ambrose Bierce,
Heraclitus and Diogenes, just off the top of my head. this list could
easily go on and on until there were 2000 names on it. (& people tell me
constantly that i don't like anything!)

3. I'm told that you, essentially, self-published A Penny  Dreadful. Can
you describe how a local author can go about the same  practice?.

whoever told you that 'a penny dreadful' is self-published is seriously
misinformed. you've seen the book -- its published by insomniac press in
toronto. that's hardly 'self-published'. self-published means you bankroll
the project yourself. with a penny dreadful, insomniac press paid to print
and promote and distribute it and i receive a small royalty on every copy
sold. i'm stepping up to the 'small time'. now, as an author, i must
compete with every other writer, living and dead, past and present. and in
north america alone, there are three hundred thousand books published a
year, so i'm not exactly sitting pretty yet...

as for local authors going about printing up their own work, if they can't
figure out how to do that on their own, they have no business publishing in
the first place. that's just my opinion. its really quite easy, but before
you publish you must have something TO publish in the first place, and
that's not so easy. go and talk to a printer. find a xerox machine and run
copies off and fold and staple your books yourself. just try not to waste
your reader's time -- make sure there is something there before you bother
going through the expense of publishing, because there is already plenty of
garbage in the world. THIS APPLIES EQUALLY TO WEBSITE CULTURE.

4. Do you find self-publishing is a fair means for artists/writers to have
their works further accessible to a broader audience?.

as a matter of fact, there are a whole slew of pro's and con's concerning
self-publishing. one major pro is that when you publish something on your
own you can do whatever the hell you want -- no committee of "experts" are
telling you "no, that won't work, it'll never fly." etc. you get your
manuscript together and then print whatever you had envisioned for the
project and essentially you have the freedom to follow your own hunches.
the other thing is that many publishers are quite stupid people -- they are
myopic from being in the industry for too long, and they no longer have any
idea what will go over in the public sphere. concrete poetry, for example,
has a hard time finding courageous publishers despite the fact that people
have been writing and reading it for at least 100 years. many many great
books by fabulous authors first entered the world through self-publication.
most of the poets in this county first got their foot in the door by
printing their own work first.

one major con of self-publishing is that most of the stuff that is
self-published tends to be of a real low-grade calibre; -- its lacklustre
mediocrity that is simply motivated by vanity. this gives all the authentic
voices within the domain of self-publishing a pretty bad name. that's where
the scorn for self-publishing enters the picture... ye olde "if you had to
pay to have it published, it wasn't worth printing in the first place." of
course, as i've said, there are some major major exceptions to this rule,
so i don't believe the pomposity of that remark one bit. books are just not
created equally.

to answer your question, though, the problem with self-publishing arises
when you now have 2000 copies of the same thing in your bedroom. without
distribution, objects stay put. they don't go anywhere and you then wind up
storing 1943 copies of the same book or cd or whatever, because you've
exhausted your audience in the area in which you live and you have no
audience on the other side of the country because all the copies of your
book or cd are still in your bedroom. that's why distribution is important,
and this is what a publisher can do for you that you can't do for yourself
as a self-publisher, unless you get into the self-distribution racket. so,
obviously its tricky!

5. Are you responsible for the promotion and marketing of A Penny
Dreadful?. If so, what do you find are the most effective marketing tools?.
How involved are you with the promotion of the  book?

the responsibility of the promotion and the marketing of any book rests
squarely on the shoulders of both the publisher and the author, in every
case. that's why authors give readings and do book tours. an effective
marketing tool that i've personally applied to this project was to
internationally spam over 3000 email addresses of art galleries and art
organizations, and magazines and publishers and artists and writers... the
whole nine yards. anyone who is anyone in the culture industry that i had
the email contact address for knows about this book through the press
release i had prepared for this express purpose. i've yet to see if it
worked, but you are interviewing me as a result of that 2 day spam session
last weekend...

6. Did you find it difficult to get the book published by a major
publishing company?

no, they contacted me. they knew about the project because its been in the
works for years and years. but Insomniac Press are hardly a 'major
publishing company'; they're more of a minor one, but still somewhat bigger
than a 'small press'. (these distinctions are hardly important, but i offer
them just the same.)

7. Are you familiar with other local authors such as Sean Byrnes and Lou
Tortolla?. Do you have any association with them? Are you an  advocate of
the local arts, not solely through " common ground", but in other ways?

i can't say i've heard of either Sean Byrnes or Lou Tortolla, and though i
don't know everything, i've been publishing in this city since 1989, among
the many other things i do -- they ought to get out more.

i am an arts advocate in this city to the hilt. i not only run this gallery
virtually by myself (which amounts to a full-time, part-time job) but i do
it for very little money. and i've done it for 2 years. that alone is
enough to make me a patron of the arts in this city. i don't give my money,
i give my time and my energy, which is more important. before i was on
payroll here, i'd been involved with this space going back as far as 1995.
i've written for many of the publications in this city, i've curated shows
here, i've given readings and done performances, i've published a few
projects like the windsor salt, to name just one, i've sat on juries and
steering committees for the arts, i've been a part-time preparator at the
art gallery of windsor for the last 2 years, i try to attend most of the
events and art openings that go on, i'm on a few boards, i've brought
interesting people to this city and i've published 2 of my 4 books here in
this city. i know most people who are and have been involved with the arts.
i enjoy working with artists and i have no intention to stop anytime soon.
on top of that, and maybe even more importantly, i've been participating in
a larger arts discourse with the 'world community' for the last 13 years,
which means that i'm looking outside of windsor too, and have an active
life as an artist outside of this city. i don't really have a reputation as
an artist in this city; i have a reputation as an intense guy with a big
mouth, so this book is coming as a bit of a shock to a lot of people.

8. Is there a clear message you are trying to portray through the pages of
A Penny Dreadful, or do you prefer your audience to internalize their own
meanings from the book?

there are lots of clear messages being portrayed in my book. its a novel
and as such it is a container for one thousand and one different ideas.
every chapter has its own theme and mood, and every page has a different
message. i would like people to reach their own conclusions about the book,
but that doesn't necessarily mean those conclusions will be the right ones!
i have my own ideas about the book, but i built it to be a fun book to
read, one that would cut across a very wide demographic. i think 15 year
olds could just as easily enjoy it as much as 50 year olds and so i
hesitate to say "this book is about what it means to be young, whilte,
male, mis-educated, poor, tormented, alienated and disenfranchised living
in canada during the nineties." it could be about that, but it could also
be a  pop-noir for the 21st century, and therefore nothing more and nothing
less than one big put-on. see, i'm just pulling your leg. its a book of
poems. its a novel. its a philosophic toy for the imagination. its a
fundamental whatsit? its all those things. read it and see for yourself.

9. It seems to me that in certain images of the book, you are critiquing
societal practices (i.e. the "normalcy" of a nuclear family, or even a
capitalist system.) Is this correct? What are your opinions on this?

the book is one long single penetrating and devastating critique of our
society. i'm glad you picked up on that. i'm one of those people who is
extremely unsatisfied with the way that things are and though i think i
know what some solutions might be, i'm hardly going to waste my life being
a politician. that's someone else's job. i simply observe and offer
commentary and hope that it might be of use to someone else who might share
similar positions. either way, i know i feel better after i've had a good
bitch and expelled some of the venom this world inspires in me.

i don't think there is such a thing as a normal nuclear family. as for
capitalism, i have no problem with making money, especially when you work
hard, i just think its a fairly repellant motive when it becomes an end in
itself. that's what has fucked this planet up in the first place, isn't it?
the bottom line is far too often over-rated. i miss the elements of
socialism that canada had going for itself as little as 20 years ago. my
generation missed out on that. -- welcome to canada. don't get sick. don't
lose your job. pay more than the mimimum wage for a package of cigarettes.
bow down, boy! mind the trucks swarming your village. you can't stop
progress so don't even try.... ok, i may not be able to stop those trucks,
or this city's lame municipal government, but that doesn't mean i have to
like it. i write about those kind of things, sometimes.

10. When will the book be available in Canada?

may 1st 2003 is the official date that 'a penny dreadful' hits the streets.
the national launch takes place in toronto, but i won't be in attendance
because i'm being forcibly evicted by the former assholes i used to live
with. this will work to my ultimate benefit, because i'm going to have my
own event in toronto when my life is less chaotic, and everyone who missed
me the first time will make a point to check it out the next. so instead of
making an appearance, i'm making a disappearance, which is cool. the book
will also be available in the united states, england, australia and japan!

11. What are your plans for its release? Do you have events and/or book
signings scheduled?

my partner in crime, miss Oona Mosna and i together have a poetry project
called gongo dodan. gongo dodan will furnish a performance to coincide with
all the promotional events surrounding this project. that basically means
we'll be giving slide-show readings with sounds and other effects. really
lo-fi, but interesting for poetry, i daresay! we've done a few things in
this city and we each have small reputations for rocking boats,
individually and collectively. there are plans to perform / promote the
book in windsor, toronto, detroit, ann arbor, sarnia, st. catherines and
ottawa. more will be tacked on by the publishers if they can pay to send me
to those places. seven cities so far though; this summer.

12. How important do you find A Penny Dreadful in terms of the importance
of local artistic expression?.

on one hand, the book has absolutely nothing to do with windsor, and on the
other hand, i've lived here since 1980 and clearly windsor had something to
do with shaping me. -- or warping me, i'm not entirely sure what windsor
did to me? but undercurrents of some of that are written into the book, and
if windsor wants to claim some of that then i'll not object. in another way
too, this book proves that there are things happening here, and that things
do come out of this city -- not just bands that move on to L.A. after they
hit big.

13. What would you like your readers to extract (most  importantly) from
reading A Penny Dreadful?.

i want people to feel like i've really given them something to chew on and
savour. i worked very very hard on this book, years of my life have been
spent on this book, and i want people to come away from the book aware of
the unique experience i've given them. that's the main thing: that people
enjoy it, because it was made for enjoyment. its a twisted little book, but
also one that i think is fun.

14. What other works have you been involved with?. How have these
influenced the making of A Penny Dreadful, if at  all?.

i've done gallery installations in and out of this city, i've worked in
performance, in and out of this city, i've had work appear in no less than
80 international publications, i've edited several projects begining in
1991, i've published 3 other books, i conduct voluminous letter-mail
correspondences with about 50 people all over the planet, and about triple
that amount in email!, i was a printmaker for 2 years which put me in close
contact with some very famous canadian artists, i've run an art gallery for
2 years, i treeplanted for 2 years, i've hopped freight-trains across this
country and back and gone on a few shorter jaunts, on trains and
hitch-hiking, i consider myself a prankster and i've dabbled in
shit-disturbance as well as street-level interventionist art tactics, which
i'm not at liberty to divulge, i've always basically worked in some form or
another, often more than 2 jobs, if you count my art practise as a job: i
was part of the first wave at the former eclectic cafe and stayed on for 3
years, i was a tooth courier for several years, i used to work in the bingo
industry for most of the arts organizations in this city, last year i
washed dishes to pay my rent, i've lived in a few other cities for spells,
etc. i've gone through about 18 seasons in hell to come out the other end
with a few stories to tell. & i'm 30, going on 60.

15. What is your favorite element of the book, and why?. =20

the part about a penny dreadful that i like the most is the fact that the
ink is sepia. that makes it a really unusual book, and i like that. the
decision to do this was a very early one, made in about 1997, but it has
taken 6 years for me to see whether it would work. its part of a larger
conceptual framework -- i've already started writing my next book, which
will be printed in cyan. so i'm writing a set of blue and brown books, just
like the proto-semiotic philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein. the brown book is
about the past, the blue book is about the future. that's the general idea,
anyway.

the great thing about this sepia aspect of the book is that it is a quiet
homage to a well known local writer named Eugene Macnamara who was at one
time "the king of the small press in canada". He published a book called
'Screens' in 1977, and that book also was printed in sepia, and it became
the model for the sepia in my book. coincidentally, i happened to see him
walking down the street a few days ago and so i ran up to him to give him a
copy of a penny dreadful. i told him "this book is Screens 2003; i used
your book as the sepia model for mine" and he said in his humble way, "oh,
i'm very touched". which was a great compliment. so in canadian literature
in the past 25 years there have been 2 brown books that have come out of
windsor: Eugene Macnamara's and mine. that's a cool windsor fact!

    It is possibly coincidental that Pound has already been evoked on one of
these threaded discourses that wend across my computer screen.  Pound is
referenced by Stewart in her discussion of the transference of emotion
through poetry (Poetry and the Fate of the Senses).  She discusses Pound's
"I" as it becomes "ye" in "On His Own Face in the Glass" and "Coda" where,
as she says, we are shown "the self turning away from its own image in the
desire to recover what is truly its own and what it truly has lost - its own
dead, its own beloved faces in the faces of others."

before this gets swallowed by theory and side-issue-squabbles let me say
that Stewart does a worthy job of tracing the philosophical antecedents to
her conclusion that poetry is privileged in making something of nothing in
its participation both in the "generalizations of inherited systems of
meaning and the particularities of expression...."concrete universals"...the
fate of pain, the fate of sense impression, the fate of emotional outpouring
are the finality of aesthetic form; but, even given this finality, aesthetic
form constantly is put under pressure to change and renew itself in order to
accommodate what time and experience have brought to it." (327 - 328)

a bit defensive but you've demonstrated that poets are able to grapple
directly with these scientific articles in their original form rather than
wait for a theoretician to hand down received wisdom. I feel a little like
David Antin here (pretentiously) encouraging experimentation but there is a
wealth of interesting material in thousands of neuropsych articles on nearby
library shelves or accessible via computer.

Mark,

This really drew me. I returned to it several times today to consider it,
reading, scrolling around for senses of it.

What seems imminent--thus fascinating to me--in Any Time Any Place is three
dimensional movement. The entire piece seems (perhaps b/c of the
intertwining curves) ready to step off the screen/implied page, to start
twirling around the room or the street--like a word-top on its own (in fact
it looks in not a bad way a tiny bit tornado-ish, maybe dust-devilly, she
said, speaking from Texas experience... ).

But it also seems very insistent on being its own alphabetic, integrated
self or phenomena.

Very nice paradoxes in all that.

Thanks for posting it!

On the Genealogy of Machines


Given that machinery is in general (and I am only speaking in general)
created from machinery, one might begin by specifying a chain A -> B -> C,
or, more generally, Mn -> Mn+1 -> Mn+2, of machines. Consider every such
chain a lineage, noting, again in general, that Mn is temporally prior to
Mn+1. Thus Mn "makes" Mn+1 and so forth. [Of course there are issues of
maintenance and repair, and the production of component parts for these
purposes. Before long, the formalism becomes a thicket; hence a beginning
direction is a consideration of a temporally-linear holarchy of fluid sets
and subsets, without contradictory feedback.]

First, -> is transitive; that is, given the series above, Mn -> Mm,
provided Mn and Mm exist within the same lineage, and n < m. [Is an
intransitive lineage possible? It depends on the meaning of ->. One might
consider, for example, an exploding-machine, or a machine whose implicate
ordering is permanently lost, or a stochastic machine. For practical
purposes, this would create a break or rupture in the establishment of
lineage; for theoretical purposes, however, the lineage, on a
practico-material level, remains intact.]

Second, note that -> is non-symmetrical; if Mn -> Mm, then not Mm -> Mn.
And third, -> is non-reflexive; Mn cannot build itself (self-bootstrapping
ab nihilo). [Of course Mm could build Mn at a later time - Mn is then an
equivalent, but not temporally-equivalent, machine. And just as genident-
ity is described by Reichenbach for states and objects, one might have a
genidentity of processes or chains of processes; a machinic lineage is an
example.] [Along with non-reflexivity, identity as a noticing or operation
also disappears. We are dealing with incipient industrializations,
typifications, and so on - see below.]

Now in general, every production is a splay, such that Mn -> {Mn+1}k,
where k references a set of equivalent machines. And further, {M}j ->
{M'}k. This is to be read - a group of disparate machines M operate in
series, parallel, or another holarchic configuration, to produce a series
of equivalent machines M'; the first are indexed by j, and the latter by
k.  Here again it is to be assumed that {M}j are temporally prior to
{M'}k. This formulation is a general lineage; the components j are
transitive as well as the ensemble in its entirety. The ontology is that
of the practico-material substrate of the world-order. [A splay, in this
instance, is a particulate emission. Thus the production of a new model of
camcorder is a splay of equivalent, but non-identical, machines. The
operations of the disparate machines collapse into the fuzzy singularity
of splay - the production of a particular model. Note that any one of the
disparate machines is transitive in relation to the splay and the
descendents of the splay, but this is all sub-set; no one of the disparate
machines produces the splay in its entirety. Every technological object,
every machine, inherits from numerous disparate machines, even if it
itself produces only a singular descendent (for example, a series of
videotapes of a particular format, from a camcorder).]

Given the potential for continuous production, it should be noted as well
that feedback loops of a sort may also be realized. Thus, if M'k itself
produces a component x that can replace a component Mj, then a new
collapse {M}j' is initiated, in which Mx occurs, continuing the production
of M'. Of course this contradicts the ontology of the practico-material
substrate, since we are now talking about a temporally later splay; the
feedback is negated as such in relation to the temporal linearity of the
production. [I see this as a red-herring, whose analysis, inordinately
complex, falls under the aegis of the social philosophy of technology, the
consumption and production of new models, issues of fashion and
functionality, etc. For the moment it is only to be noted that feedback is
never a-temporal, but always after the fact; in an operational amplifier,
for example, the speed of feedback - close to the speed of light in the
return loop - may appear to act synchronously upon events, but this is
only the result of the relative difference between the temporal magnitude
of events and looping - a difference of great magnitude.]

There is no first tool N1; every tool presupposes another. There is no
originary tool N0 as well. [The presupposition is, of course, as fuzzy as
everything else; one might carve a hand-axe with 'natural' elements, or
make a walking-stick by breaking a branch. But the machinic itself is part
and parcel of the body; culture is always technological. Likewise, just as
there is no origin for language, there is no originary tool; the
pointing-finger is a tool for direction, the turning-head a vision-tool,
and so forth. Likewise, there is no implied transcendence as well - only
an inchoate series of fuzzy shifts.]

There is no identity operation; equivalences are defined by models,
typifications, tolerances, and the like. There is forking which results in
equivalence, and collapsed forking which results in collapse-production.
The moment of production is always contains a parasitology of noise and an
energy input; the moment, in fact, plays/splays into issues of
thermodynamic and cybernetic entropy. [Thus the machinic is the self-play
or jostling of the world. And the world is a world of information,
encodings, ruptures, and dissolutions: The world is the aegis of the word.
The world is the aegis of the world.]

According to this model, the machinic is inseparable from the bodies which
augment, prostheticize, and catalyze it; technology and biology are
mutually emergent. [And both are mutually submerged as well - tacit as
well, within the originary non-existent moment of language. The
epistemology at work is one of elision, ellipsis, erasure, gliding...]

Who has traced back even a single lineage, for example, that of a
needle-nosed pliers, into its components, ancestors, materials, entropies,
production energies? After one or two generations, everything is lost; the
machines among us carry the signs of lineage, but these become quickly
inchoate, lost in the heat and fire of molding, forging, mixture, and so
forth. Every machine is an erasure, appearing as if born from nothing,
tending towards everything. Every machine is a stranger among us,
including our own flesh, our own bodies; the world is transformed into a
re/productive mirror. [Every machine cauterizes, eliminates, its ancestry;
in a sense, that is a major characteristic of machinery, whose domain is
that of functionality - a domain within which both history and memory are
intrusions.] [A memory machine is a contradiction in terms; a memory
machine reproduces the other. Within the chain A -> B -> C, every machine,
every term, is isolated; A operates and conspires in the production of B,
but A is already a withdrawal, a cleansing. B has entered another
sub-world altogether, another domain or phenomenological horizon. It is
always the case, and it is in this sense that the world is always the
case.]

For a critical project I'm working on, I am collecting statements by =
artists that discuss the production of one type of art in the mode of =
another. Here are three examples of the kind of statement I am looking =
for:

"We tried to use the cameras the way musicians used their instruments." =
D.A. Pennebaker referring to the making of Don't Look Back.

=20

"I was doing what the cinema was doing." Gertrude Stein describing her =
composition techniques in the Portraits

=20

"One's contemporaries, in the truest sense of the term, are always =
artists who use another medium." Ezra Pound


Any contributions from listmembers to this collection of statements =
would be most appreciated. Backchannel please (I will post the results =
of my query once they have been compiled)

All best,

Scott Pound

Hi all, This is one instance in which, believe it or not, you may actually be
able to make a difference.  -m.

- -- ---AMNINA LAWAL SET TO BE STONED ON 3RD JUNE--- -- -
       The Nigerian Supreme Court has upheld the death sentence for Amina
Lawal, condemned for the crime of adultery on August 19th 2002, to be buried up
to her neck and stoned to death. Her death was postponed so that she could
continue to nurse her baby. Execution is now set for June 3rd.
       If you haven't been following this case, you might like to know that
Amina's baby is regarded as the 'evidence' of her adultery. The father denied
everything when he realised the trouble he was in.
To find out more about sharia law, see
http://www.guardian.co.uk/theissues/article/0,6512,777972,00.html
       Amina's case is being handled by the Spanish branch of Amnesty
International, which is attempting to put together enough signatures to make
the Nigerian government rescind the death sentence. A similar campaign saved
another Nigerian woman, Safiya, condemned in similar circumstances.  By March
4th the petition had amassed over 2,600,000 signatures. It will only take you a
few seconds to sign Amnesty's online petition. Go to the web page
http://www.amnistiaporsafiya.org/
       Enter your first name in the space marked "nombre", last name
("apellidos"), county ("provincia"), country, and in the drop down box pick
"Estados Unidos" (United States)...unless you're timmy and live in Alemania.
Then click on "Seguir" and go to the second page. There you have the option of
entering your email address if you wish to receive follow-up information. In
any case, be sure to click on "aceptar" to have your name added to the petition
list.
       Please sign the petition now, then copy this message into a new email
and send it to everyone in your address book.

Great late-night channeling: I see epiphany early on, but, and most
strikingly, I was very satisfied by the way it didn't close at the ending,
but, rather opened-- you've got some great questions, visions and
circumcribed domains that never stay circumscribed. Thank you for this this
morning.

I know where you and I end
well enough to breathe here un-

tampered-with: a certain perfection
glazing our, lips, like candy
's haze: memories of
the grass hanging from

the trees with our toes, eating clouds
the mind un-

well enough to welcome gluts
of bread-rise in the snakey foam.
I wish I knew what you think of

between this life and the
greatest generation: milking

B-52s from my nipples in whirring
strands, pearls for the beastly
grin I give this old man

cementing his brain with
lived-in furs. He understands

where he ends and I began--

in benign and gingerly ebbing, the

Hi Joel,
Aleksandr Mejirov is a poet of the WW2 generation, whom Evtushenko and other Red Cats considered to be their mentor. Allen Ginsberg went out of his way to visit him in Peredelkino during his trip to Russia in the midsixties. He is a very decent human being, but very conservative poet. I believe he personally knew Pasternak. He also lives right next to you in Portland, Oregon, and I mentioned to him about yr inquiry in our phone chat today. He is over 90 now, and doesn't speak a word of English. If you find Dean (of English? Comparative studies? i am not sure) Sandra Rozencrant in yr university, she can assist you with contacting Mejirov (he says she speaks excellent Russian).
Backchannel if you need his phone number.

Best,
Igor Satanovsky

Dorothy Richardson just came over the wire, a town in central Poland,
several hundred students, or adults, or students, or--everyone meets
in the Red Bus Bar. Grey, steel grey, the skies, the buildings, the
flats in the buildings, and the terms? Equal, the movement of young
people. Sterling. What is One Pound Sterling? The international
teachers in Tomsk all say they came here for the work. In their mid-
to late-20s, out of school, from France, Italy, Spain, Germany,
Russian study in school, English study, fluency in Russian and
English, at the party Sunday listening to voices moving across the
languages, and English, an adjacency, or backdrop, what everybody
knows, has to know, only you have to know how to pretend not to know
it--only how can it be said in so many languages for them, their
generation: There are no jobs? So you travel, country to country, visa
by visa, teaching the Lingua Franca, or Franco, passing by, passing
on. There is a class of youth teaching anything, anywhere, just to get
by. There are many days that appear to me to be circa 1912-1913.

* * *

The School.  The school comprises of five classrooms, a teachers room,
a resources room, an office/bookshop and a social club called "RED BUS
BAR" -  everything at one of the main streets in Opole. It is close to
the railway and bus stations. The bulk of teaching takes place between
3pm and 8 pm. There are also business contracts, some of them are
taught in the morning. Some residential courses for business clients
are also provided.

The school is also an UCLES Examinations Centre (FCE, CAE, CPE), what
creates a good opportunity for teachers to work as oral examiners,
supervisors and invigilators during the session, gaining extra
experience and money. The school is recognised by PASE organisation
(Polish Association for Standards in English). It means the quality of
our service must be up to PASE standards and requirements.

The school started in January 1992. At present it has above 400
students and a wide range of business contracts. Opole is a  relaxed
friendly city with sprawling modern housing estates built around the
old town which runs along the banks of the river Odra.

Local attractions include a large park ten minutes walk from the
school and a large open-air museum. There is a lively cultural scene
with two theatres, a concert hall, and two cinemas which show mainly
English and American films, in English subtitled in Polish.

Opole is the patron city of music in Poland and every June there is a
week long open-air festival with some of the best Polish bands, the
amphitheatre also hosts occasional rock concerts and next door there
is an ice rink. There is a lot of fitness clubs and an indoor swimming
pool. Opole has a good range of shops especially for the day to day
items and a good food market.

The Tatra and Beskidy mountains provide skiing in winter and walking
and climbing in summer. Krakw is one of the most beautiful cities in
Central Europe and a good place for a souvenir shopping. Also well
worth a visit is Zakopane, Poland's winter capital. South of Opole is
a large national park with good facilities for walkers. The Czech
Republic is only a few hours away and there are regular trains and
buses.

Housing: Accommodation is completely free and provided in shared
flats, although some single accommodation might be available, at the
time of writing they all have telephone. Flats are likely to be
adequate as far as space, heating, and distance from school are
concerned, but might not include colour TV, or a washing machine (at
the moment every flat does have a washing machine.

Travel: Teachers, who sign contracts for the whole academic year are
offered a choice of either, a return flight from the U.K. to Poland at
the beginning and end of contract, or a return coach ticket from
London to Opole at the beginning and end of contract, and a return
coach ticket at Christmas. The school decided to offer a choice
because it was felt that the baggage allowance on flights is rather
small. Teachers will always be met, and sent full instructions and a
map before they set off.

There is a good local bus system, which is quite cheap, although most
flats are within walking distance of the school. Rail fares are not
over expensive in Poland, Opole to Warsaw would set you back just over
ten pounds. Local trains are very cheap, and Poland has an extensive
coach network.

General Information: The climate in Poland is more extreme than in the
U.K. It gets very cold in winter and very hot in summer. Teachers are
recommended to bring good winter boots and a winter coat. Good quality
clothes can be expensive in Poland, although there are some good
bargains as well. Teachers might like to think about bringing a supply
of small home comforts, recommended items in a poll of last years
teachers would include Marmite, Branston Pickle, Body Shop Products,
Thermals, a short wave radio for the BBC World Service, and a magazine
subscription.

Oregon, and I mentioned to him about yr inquiry in our phone chat today. He
is over 90 now, and doesn't speak a word of English. If you find Dean (of
English? Comparative studies? i am not sure) Sandra Rozencrant in yr
university, she can assist you with contacting Mejirov (he says she speaks
excellent Russian).

Igor:

Thanks so much for this information.
He lives in my building! I shoot pool with him. But, as you say, he doesn't
speak English.
I asked him if he knew Evtushenko, and he nodded when he heard the name.
Wish I could have a conversation with him. So close yet so far!

Best,
Joel

Scott --

My recent book Days (Lavender Ink, 2002) is an example for your project.
 Much of Days is an effort to make use of the improvisatory qualities of
a Thelonious Monk solo in the domain of words -- similar turns and
twists, similar right-wrong notes, similar humor.  On the back cover,
poet John Gery begins by referring to my "unique adaptation of
Thelonious Monk's rhythms..." and goes on to say "While echoes of sundry
other poets familiar and new find their way into Lazer's syncopated
riffs, his slanting melodies play 'against or out/ of time,' evoking
everyting from the verancular to the vestigial, 'lower limit speech/ to
upper limit/ music.' "  Gery ends with: "And like Monk at his best, Days
often leaves us swimming in a delight and wisdom we can't find words for."

You get the basic drift -- not poems ABOUT jazz, but poems enacting or
embodying (or music-ing foth) the twists, turns, improvisations, joys,
sqwawks, honks, movements of jazz....

Best,

Hank Lazer

I made this website for Beyond Baroque in Venice,CA  to promote a poetry
potluck and group photo event on the BB front lawn called The Big Picture -
the links page is very comprehensive covering the "LA Scene"  and the about
page has a nice essay by Bill Mohr about the history of LA poetry community
or at least its roots:

http://www.beyondbaroque.org/bigpicture/links.html

The link to Next magazine/calendar is a good place to start when you come
out here - just start going to events and you should be plugged in pretty
quickly :-)

Also at the end here - is the essay -  try to filter out the event promo parts.

Towards an Impossible Anthology

By Bill Mohr (March 2002)


Very few group photographs of Los Angeles poets have ever been published
except in the occasional anthology which focuses on Southern California
poetry. The average number of poets in these photographs is less than
twenty, and none of the photographs are accompanied by a list which
identifies the assembled figures. The visual historical record, then, is
very thin, compared to the quantity of material published by poets living
in Los Angeles since the end of World War II. One of the first of these
anthology photographs was included in a collection edited by Paul
Vangelisti, Charles Bukowski, and Neeli Cherri in 1971, entitled simply,
ANTHOLOGY OF L.A. POETS. Bukowksi contributed a thoughtful introduction
which praised the flexibility of Los Angeles as a city which allowed poets
to be alone or to find each other's company with equal ease. The book
itself had a plain, dark brown cover with no art or blurbs whatsoever, as
if to insist that the poets were not interrested in participating in any
kind of marketing campaign whatsoever. By the early seventies, even the
underground had begun to perfect and copyright its scruffiness, but these
poets seemed reluctant to acknowledgte any need to be visible other than in
their own writing. Nevertheless, Vangelisti seems to have coaxed most of
the poets who were in town at the time into gathering on a bright afternoon
on what looks like an outdoor plaza. The setting, according to Vangelisti,
is actually the front of a Greek Orthodox church on DeLongpre Ave., a few
doors away from Bukowski lived in the late 60s and early 70s. Vangelisti
went on to edit another anthology which featured many of these poets, but
the photographs for this larger collection were individual shots.

The first group photograph which featured poets at Beyond Baroque was used
as the cover of a small anthology of the Wednesday night workshop members
edited by Lynn Shoemaker. The picture appears to have been shot at night,
perhaps on a mid-winter evening, as some of the poets are wearing stocking
caps, and several have heavy jackets on. Once again, one is left to guess
at how the faces on the cover might correlate with the authors inside.

The third anthology with a group photograph is significant for its emphasis
on the phenomenon of multi-cultural poetry in Los Angeles. The photograph
by Marlene Alvarado includes about half of the 33 poets whose work appears
in INVOCATION L.A., edited by Michelle T. Clinton, Sesshu Foster, and Naomi
Quinonez. The backdrop of the photograph appears to be downtown Los
Angeles, in the form of several office towers.

All of these photographs give little indication of the scale and intensity
of the communities of poets in Los Angeles during the past fifty years.
Only a month of daily study of magazines such as INVISIBLE CITY, RARA AVIS,
ONTHEBUS, BEYOND BAROQUE NEW, BACHY, TEMBLOR, ARSHILE, THE SUNSET PALMS
HOTEL, BARNEY, VARIEGATION, COASTLINES, CALIFORNIA QUARTERLY, TRACE,
MOMENTUM, LITTLE CAESAR, and SANTA MONICA REVIEW could begin to yield a
sense of the extraordinary diversity of writing which has occurred in this
region. How much is currently going on in Los Angeles. I would estimate
that there are at least 300 poets in the Los Angeles area whose work has
appeared in magazines all across the United States, as well as in
anthologies and recordings. Almost all of these poets know at least one
other serious poet in the area whose work is unknown except to the
reclusive coterie, which is to say that there is a indeterminate second
layer of poets in this city poised to release a large body of intriguing
work.

The difficulty of establishing any precise census is in part due to the
culture industry of the music and film business which dominates the
cultural economy of Los Angeles. Any attempt to survey poets in Los Angeles
will inevitably collide with the limitations which any given group of poets
will impose on their definition of "poet," especially if the work of any
given writer smacks of theatricality. Some poets are extremely skeptical
about the claims which performance poets make for the value of their work.
Other groups savor the work of performance/oral/spoken word poets, while
still insisting that their own poems must work on both the page and out
loud. Regardless of whether the poets fall into the spoken word or the
"stand up" poetry group, the poets in Los Angeles have earned a remarkable
reputation for being consistently vivid readers of their poems.

The need for a comprehensive anthology of Los Angeles poets is greater than
ever before, and yet the scenes continue to multiply at a rate which would
defy anyone's ability to orchestrate such a gathering. Perhaps the group
photograph which Mark Savage will soon take will be the closest anyone can
come at giving the city of Los Angeles an estimate of how many of its
citizens believe in the imaginative potential of this city.

MIME-Version: 1.0

Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

In the interests of maximum market penetration, I wanted to reprint a tiny review
I just got from CHOICE: CURRENT REVIEW FOR ACADEMIC LIBRARIES in case there's
anybody else on this list who loves the poetry of Gregory Corso.  The review
appears in March 2003 Vol. 40 No. 07 in the Humanities/ Language & Literature --
English and American section.

Olson, Kirby.  GREGORY CORSO: DOUBTING THOMIST.  Southern Illinois, 2002.  183p
bibl index afp ISBN 0-8093-2447-4, $40.00.

This book should help bring more readers to a gifted and important US poet.
Olson (SUNY, Delhi) attempts to place Corso's work in a philosophical perspective
that ranges between a Catholic Thomist viewpoint and wildly comic surrealism.
Though he undoubtedly reaches throughout the text (Corso did indeed deny his
Catholicism), Olson makes an interesting case for viewing Corso's work as a quest
to understand the universe in religious terms.  Readers need the holistic view
that emerges from this study to counterbalance the usual view of Corso as merely
entertaining and hilarious.  The book's nine chapters address Corso's concerns,
background, aesthetics, influences, and even a psychiatric evaluation.  Olson
argues persuasively for Corso's importance as a Catholic in the postmodern US
literary canon, based on the profundity and intensity of his questioning.  The
book extends the important work of Michael Skau in his outstanding "A Clown in a
Grave": Complexities and Tensions in the Works of Gregory Corso (CH, Mar '00).
Olson's writing is engaging throughout and he includes a useful bibliography.
Summing Up: Recommended.  All collections of contemporary American poetry.  -- L.
Berk, Ulster County Community College.

Pretty nice review, huh?  The one line that stings is where he says that Corso
did indeed deny his Catholicism.  But he also said, "Once a Catholic always a
Catholic" in an interview in Kentucky in the early nineties that appears in a
tiny chapbook of his stuff that only came out in 100 copies.  But I think this is
apparent throughout his work -- his early Catholic training stayed with him, and
he was like Fred Flintstone putting out the dinosaur.  It kept coming back in the
window after he had put it out.  Not that I'm complaining too much about that
line.  I do reach after what I find important in his work -- an attempt to
understand the world in religious terms. He goes through a lot of different
systems, from Sumerian to Egyptian, and so on, but he always has one foot in the
Catholic world.

I'm reading Corso's letters now just out from New Directions -- an Accidental
Autobiography.  I wish somebody would put together a big collection of Corso
anecdotes.  There are so many funny stories, and it seems that almost everybody I
know has one.  Does anybody know of anything like this in the works?  I think it
would be a best-seller.

in-the-Bowery has served as a venue for public literary events and as a
resource for writers. Housed in St. Mark=B9s Church in-the-Bowery, a landmark
church in Manhattan=B9s East Village, the Poetry Project was the scene of the
only joint reading by Robert Lowell and Allen Ginsberg and has been the sit=
e

Reznikoff, Frank O=B9Hara, Ted Berrigan, and Edwin Denby. Over the years,

integrity of programming that challenges, informs and inspires working
writers, while remaining accessible to the general public. While being
committed to the highest standards of artistic excellence and to preserving
vital literary traditions, the Poetry Project has always encouraged the
participation of new poets with diverse styles. In fact, each year one-thir=
d
of the writers presenting work at the Project are doing so for the first
time. The Poetry Project offers a Wednesday night readings series, a Monday
night reading/performance series, a Friday late-evening events series; thre=
e

Question not backchanneled because your answer may be
of interest to more than me: how about one type of art
in the mode of some other cultural process--my making
poems as long division examples, for instance?  In
fact, I would be very interested in learning of
artists making work in any mode of science.  I've
always wanted to make poems as chemical equations but
never succeeded.  I'm sure there have been
poem/flowcharts. . . .

I agree that posting to the list might be of interest to many as the
definition of 'intermedia synergy' is not really clear, possibly because it
could refer to poetry as a product or as a process.  For example I am often
'synergized' by using the spatial, visceral, or gestural impulses in writing
or drawing but it's possible that the poetic and the spatial (or visceral or
gestural) never achieve the state of a work of art?

I'm not sure what you had in mind in your response, Bob, but I assume you
are referring to use of formulas as algorithhms although the idea of
flowcharts does seem to imply motion along with the flow?

Scott,
If you'd like this as a statement let me know.   I posted it to the list
more to generate others' thoughts or maybe to get  some hormones flowing
through my arteries.

tom bell
not yet a crazy old man
hard but not yet hardening of the
arteries or maybe it's poetry that fills
in the blanks that clogs?

Actually, I've been singing that song for years on the Poetics list.  We
agree.  I'm not sure I understand Derek's argument, if that's what it is.  He
seems to position his "transcendent" simultaneously within and without
language--and that just ain't logical.  Definitely a theological thing
happening there.  Best, Bill

I liked the article quite a bit, but I have one question about criticism of
Gregory Corso's work. Has anyone ever investigated the connections between
Gregory Corso's work and Catholic Mysticism? I cannot pretend to know how
those two would relate, but I think of the question because of a quote from
Jack Kerouac, who (if my memory is correct) stated later in life that in
reality he was a Catholic Mystic.

Of "once a Catholic, always a catholic", I had a friend who refered to this
the "recovering catholic."

We affirm and deny many things (logic) because the nature of words/logic
(the imagination), NOT the nature of things, allows us to affirm and
deny them.



For instance, we think those things which are easiest for us to imagine
are somehow clearer to us -- that we understand what is easy-to-imagine.
Our ability to imagine anything must, logically, be proof that we
understand. One can point to all their friends and they will say "Yes!
This is what *we also* have imagined! You understand correctly." Then we
all hold hands and glory in our understanding.

But...

From my body to other bodies
Angels and bastards interchangeably
Who had better sing and tell stories
Before all will be abstracted
                                        -- Zukofsky, "A-12"

the same as...

We were talking
about the space between us all
and people who hide themselves
behind a wall of illusion
never glimpse the truth
then it's far too late
when they pass away
                                        -- Harrison, "Within You Without
You"

to help you see the Wisdom of 'loosening this dependence' on logic, or
dependence on anything else -- namely to try *receptivity* (tho, maybe
you're a hard-core Elvis-person and just shoot TV-sets) -->
http://dictionary.reference.com/search?&q=receptivity

Reliance on external orders (logic) brings about the *difficulty of
distinguishing* between what is imagination and what, truly, is
understanding (angels and bastards interchangeably).

For instance, words, just as much as the imagination, can be the cause
of many grave errors, unless we take precautions against them
(Coleridge, "Biographia Literaria," Chapter XXII).

This is because words are established in accordance with the crowd,
which is to say they are merely *signs of things* (things as they are
imagined), and are NOT things 'as they are' (the thing itself).

If the above is not known, we may easily take something false to be
true.

When you've seen beyond yourself
then you may find
peace of mind is waiting there
And the time will come
when you see we're all one
and life flows on within you and without you


Take and owe nothing.

Just an added thought: Amnesty International (amnesty.org) is a pretty
reliable source for the facts on cases like this. They have a story
about Amina Lawal on their main page now. They do suggest writing to
Nigerian FEDERAL authorities, but also say that they are keeping quiet
to let the justice system do its job (hopefully by acquitting her in
June).

It is perhaps 'theological' as you dismiss it here but there is too much
psychological and other evidence to dismiss the prelogical by equating it
with the unconscious or cast it in theological terms.  To put it in
flowchart terms like Bob suggested:

one tenth of the iceberg of reality conforms to logic














and one tenth resides in the unconscious or theological where devils wrestle
with angels but the liminal is vast and where we live and poetry resides? If
you stare at that vast space above it might flow into something sensible or
maybe I missed it?

then isn't the applied logic incorrect? And how does one bridge that gap?

WHEN WE WITH REXROTH

A night to celebrate the memory and poetry of Kenneth Rexroth

May 27, 2003 | The Bowery Poetry Club
7:00 =96 9:00 p.m. | 308 Bowery St., New York, NY 10012

On Tuesday, May 27th, the Bowery Poetry Club will celebrate KENNETH
REXROTH. With the 2003 release of THE COMPLETE POEMS OF KENNETH REXROTH,
Copper Canyon Press has introduced some of the most vital American
poetry of the twentieth century to a new generation of readers. To honor
his poems and to remember Rexroth, the editors of the new release Sam
Hamill and Bradford Morrow along with Jessica Hagedorn and Eliot
Weinberger will read from Rexroth=92s poetry and share recollections of
the late poet.

Kenneth Rexroth was born in 1905 in South Bend, Indiana. The author of
nearly sixty books, including translations from the Chinese, Japanese,
Italian, and Swedish, and his Classics and Classics Revisited among
several volumes of essays, he was one of the most original and universal
literary scholars of the century. His vision of brotherhood embodied by
a moral, aesthetic, and spiritual clarity=97unknown to many=97will =
provide
us with a night of a lucid criticism as we ponder the current war with
Iraq and the unrest fostered by our government.

Jessica Hagedorn moved from Manila, Philippines to San Francisco at the
age of fourteen, and became a prot=E9g=E9 of Rexroth. Hagedorn's work
includes poetry, prose, performance art, and music. In addition to two
novels, Hagedorn's books include a collection of poetry and short prose.
She is also the editor of Charlie Chan is Dead.=20

Sam Hamill is the author of thirteen volumes of poetry. Hamill taught in
prisons for fourteen years, in artist-in-residency programs for twenty
years, and has worked extensively with battered women and children. He
is the founding editor of Copper Canyon Press and director of the Port
Townsend Writers' Conference. Hamill currently lives in Port Townsend,
Washington.

Bradford Morrow is the literary executor for the Kenneth Rexroth Trust.
Morrow founded the literary journal Conjunctions in 1981. He is the
author of five novels: Come Sunday, The Almanac Branch, Trinity Fields,
Giovanni's Gift, and most recently Ariel=92s Crossing.

Eliot Weinberger is the author of three collections of essays published
by New Directions, and the editor and translator of works by Octavio
Paz, Jorge Luis Borges, Vicente Huidobro, and Bei Dao. His most recent
books are 9/12 (political articles) and the New Directions Anthology of
Classical Chinese Poetry, which he edited.=20

I know this letter does not have immediate bearing on the making of poetry
but I believe its content is urgent to us as citizens and deserves to be
circulated as widely as possible. The implications are full blown "computer
noir" with direct impact on the representational shape of the country's
governance.
Alerting congressional, state and local reps - and promoting correctional
legislation - appears crucial.
Stephen V

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Letter from actor Peter Coyote to Senator Barbara Boxer:

Dear Barbara,

I'm writing to you about a situation of the greatest urgency. Last year, I
narrated a film called "Unprecedented" by American journalist Greg Palast
(currently writing for the London Guardian). This film documents the illegal
expunging of 54,000 black and overwhelmingly Democratic voters from the
Florida rolls just before the presidential election. We interviewed the
computer company that did the work, filmed their explanations of the
instructions they received and their admissions that they knew that their
instructions would produce massive error. That figure has now been revised
to 91,000.

Jeb Bush was sued, and was supposed to have returned these voters to the
rolls, and did not, which explains his last re-election. The Republicans
have something far worse in mind for the next presidential election and
Democrats need to be prepared. The recent elections of Nebraska  Republican
Chuck Hagel, the loss in Georgia of Max Cleland, wildly popular Vietnam vet,
and the victory of Alabama Governor Bob Riley, along with a handful of other
Republican victories, (all predicted to have been losers by straw polls
which our nation has refined to a high-art) points to an ominous source:
corporate-programmed, computer-controlled, modem-capable voting machine,
recording and tabulating ballots.

You'd think in an open democracy that the government--answerable to all its
citizens, rather than a handful of corporate officers and stockholders--
would program, repair, and control the voting machines. You'd think the
computers that handle our cherished ballots would be open and their software
and programming available for public scrutiny. You'd think there would be a
paper trail of the vote, which could be followed and audited if a there was
evidence of voting fraud or if exit polls disagreed with computerized vote
counts. You'd be wrong.

The Washington, DC publication The Hill
http://www.thehill.com/news/012903/hagel.aspx  has confirmed that former
conservative radio talk-show host and now Republican U.S. Senator Chuck
Hagel was the head of, and continues to own part interest in, the company
that owns the company that installed, programmed, and largely ran the voting
machines that were used by most of the citizens of Nebraska. When
Democrat,Charlie Matulka requested a hand count of the vote in the election
he lost to Hagel, his request was denied because Nebraska had a just-passed
law that prohibits government-employee election workers from looking at the
ballots, even in a recount. The only machines permitted to count votes in
Nebraska, he said, are those made and programmed by the corporation formerly
run by Hagel.

When Bev Harris and The Hill's Alexander Bolton pressed the Chief Counsel
and Director of the Senate Ethics Committee, (the man responsible for
ensuring that FEC disclosures are complete), asking him why he'd not
questioned Hagel's 1995, 1996, and 2001 failures to disclose the details of
his ownership in the company that owned the voting machine company when he
ran for the Senate, the Director reportedly met with Hagel's office on
Friday, January 25, 2003 and Monday, January 27, 2003. After the second
meeting, on the afternoon of January 27th, the Director of the Senate Ethics
Committee resigned his job.

Hagel's surprise victory is a trial-run for the presidential election.
Election 'reform' laws are now prohibiting paper ballots (no trail) and exit
polls, effectively removing all trace and record of votes, making
prosecution of voter fraud virtually impossible. For whatever reasons, the
Democrats decided not to pursue the issue of fraudulence in the last
Presidential election. The three Supreme Court Justices who should have
recused themselves (Scalia, Thomas and O'Connor) were allowed to stand
unchallenged and pass a bizarre one-time only ruling. That they were in
place long before the election demonstrates how clearly the end-game of such
moves was thought out.

Unless the issue of voter fraud is elevated to an issue of national
importance, not only is it highly probably that Democrats will lose again
and again, but eventually voters will "sense" even if they cannot prove,
that elections are rigged, and the current 50% of those boycotting elections
will swell to the majority. Privatization of the vote is tantamount to
turning over the control of democracy to the corporate sector. I urge you to
use your considerable powers and influence to address this issue.

On a Wednesday sentient
with swallows two or three
I grew up in the shade.

Starving, I gathered tufts
in a thickness, the cat-hair
atoning for, which music
ruffled like cochlea between
taut ruddy muscle and the

growing through
my hands and feet

(walking home still
from the video store
last night I was still
walking through rain
of late spring still
dying with a floral
noise and peppered
by the spill of floral
essence). My fingers
are in bloom:

see how they turn
through this growing up
on Wednesday to find
Renee flickers like a
late spring rain in stillness:

(she's already and
always asleep) this
might be a perfection
I hadn't noticed:

eating the voluminous
damage from
years ago.

A cat
licking herself
gets hair-balls
in her belly.
I won't choke!

I won't
make a sound
to displace
my lover's
sleep.

Fashionable Noise: On Digital Poetics
by Brian Kim Stefans

        Atelos is pleased to announce the publication on July 30, 2003
of Fashionable Noise: On Digital Poetics by Brian Kim Stefans.

About the book:=20
        Brian Kim Stefans=92 Fashionable Noise: On Digital Poetics eludes
any singular description =97 it is too various. At once, Fashionable =
Noise
explodes with ingredients of essay, games, and poetry, and it is always
engaging, always thought provoking. How does limitless replication and
change affect a dialogue one might try to have with another poet=92s
words? What=92s so interesting about the hidden code behind the link =
_Walt
Disney_ that misdirects you, takes you to the wrong site? Stefans
confronts these questions, and the ease with which he simultaneously
discusses, investigates, and incorporates those elements that might make
up a digital poetics is astounding. Generating poetry with a computer
program, synthesizing Scots by using an algorithm accompanied by
dictionaries, employing an ICQ chat transcript as the conduit for
delivering a significant discussion on digital poetics: these are just a
few examples of what readers will find in this book. Although =93the
webwork, unlike the earthwork, can never be photographed from a
satellite perspective,=94 Fashionable Noise: On Digital Poetics is on =
the
forefront of mapping out a rapidly emerging, constantly morphing,
virtual terrain.

About the author:=20
        Brian Kim Stefans is the author of Free Space Comix (1998), Gulf
(1998/2000), and Angry Penguins (2000). He has been an active presence
on the internet for several years, editing arras.net (www.arras.net) =97 =
a
ceaselessly original site devoted to new media poetry and poetics =97 =
and
creating works such as the acclaimed Flash poem =93The Dreamlife of
Letters=94 (www.ubu.com/contemp/stefans/dream/) and a setting of the =
=93e=94
chapter of Christian B=F6k=92s Eunoia
(www.arras.net/RNG/flash/eunoia/eunoia_final.html). He is an active
literary and cultural critic, publishing frequently in the Boston
Review, Jacket, and elsewhere. He lives in New York City.

About the project:
        Atelos was founded in 1995 as a project of the nonprofit
foundation Hip=92s Road. Atelos is devoted to publishing, under the sign
of poetry, writing which challenges the conventional definitions of
poetry. All the works published as part of the Atelos project are
commissioned specifically for it, and each is involved in some way with
crossing traditional genre boundaries, including, for example, those
that would separate theory from practice, poetry from prose, essay from
drama, the visual image from the verbal, the literary from the
non-literary, and so forth. The Atelos project when complete will
consist of 50 volumes; Fashionable Noise is volume 14. The project
directors and editors are Lyn Hejinian and Travis Ortiz; the editor for
cover production and design is by Ree Katrak.

You know, I'd like to argue against some of what I said earlier about the
impossibility of asemic knowledge. It seems to me now kind of belligerent
to make such a pronouncement on something like the relationship a believer
might have w/ the divine, and I'd like to retract it.

It it still the case that in every theist faith known to me, the
relationship between god & mortal is carried out through densely
articulated sign-systems, viz. the omen, the teras, the sema, the oth, the
ayah, and the various bird-omens. Like what Daniel Webster said about the
now-fallen Old Man of the Mountain: "But up in the Franconia Mountains God
Almighty has hung out a sign to show that in New England He makes men." I
think this kind of sign is pretty much the template for everything we know.
But I think many religious believers are reluctant to trace their
relationship with the divine to anything so vulgar as an omen, and feel a
genuine intimacy with it that is not mediated by signs. Like the Sufis who
ache for the tickle of God's breath on their face --would you call that
breath a sign? The Qur'an does, when it's blown into Adam's nostrils, but I
bet if you're actually feeling it it's something else entirely.

So if you've had some ecstatic experience with God that was no way a
"vision," or if you enjoy a quietly immanent immanent relationship with him
for which you require no evidence, I'm not going to tell you otherwise. I'm
just going to worship elsewhere LRSN

What am I missing here?  I don't understand your first comment (probably my

Why?  What have you got against the theological?  All of Romanticism circles
the theological.

But I think we're all talking at cross-purposes.  Not unlike the story that
becomes something other via many tellings.  I thought this thread began with
a claim that it was possible to observe the pre-cognitive, to write a poetry
that accesses the pre-cognitive.  The pre-logical was not the issue.  My
point is simply that all ideas, relations, logic, illogic, differences,
identities, et al are products of language, i.e., of a semiotic system
however developed, however "advanced."  Cognition--the process of knowing, of
perception--may begin without language, in the sense of beyond or before it.
But these beginnings are not available to man.  Once anything means for man,
that meaning is produced by, bound by and contingent upon the semiotic
system.  All meaning is.  Once an idea obtains--as soon as observation
becomes meaningful for us, it is semiotic.  If it doesn't mean, it is not
part of our world.  It is not "there" for us.  In other words, language
brings such things into existence for us.

I'm fairly certain that many psychologists/psychoanalysts would agree.  Lacan
certainly believed the unconscious was linguistic.  But where is the
unconscious?  Do we occupy it?  Can we?  If it is somewhere outside of
language, then it's debatable if a "we" or "I" exists in that "place" to
observe.  Do we not surmise its existence by working backward (as I said
previously) from the text, in this case from the text of what we interpret as
the effects of the unconscious on behavior, or on dreams which themselves are
semiotic?
When you think about it, psychoanalysists spend a lot of time listening to
patients talk, guiding patients toward the inner talk that will soothe.

I also had a slight problem with some of the examples presented:  Pound's
"presentation," for one.  Pound's image, that word or series of words which
presents the thing as it is without commentary, without mediation (Pound uses
the term "correspondence" a lot), is not a reference to the pre-cognitive.
If anyone thinks otherwise, I'd love to hear the argument.  I'm open to that,
most definitely.

Pound, like Eliot, also refers to an intellectual and emotional nexus that,
he urges, must be "presented" without excess baggage (like too many
adjectives).  But we must remember that while Pound was writing all this, a
revolution was occuring in linguistics, one that actually began quietly in
the late 19th century, got its legs with Saussure, and didn't really get to
walk around until decades later.  Pound, despite his brilliance, was still
attached to ideas that were on their way out.  Eliot was actually more in
tune with what was happening in linguistics and philosophy (not surprising
since his aborted Ph.D. was to be awarded in the latter discipline).  There
is plenty of evidence in his dissertation and in Four Quartets that he
understood the self and its world as linguistic events.

Anyway, just trying to work out my own confusion re:  this thread.  Best to
all, Bill

anything prelogical automatically becomes logical once it is discussed.
julia kristeva offers an interesting site/non-site with Plato's chora from
_Timeaus_, in _Revolution in Poetic Language_ and goes so far as to say that
it is allowed to posses the qualities of being a non-site because of its
reference to significance (pre-lingual /logical /conscious).  Deleuze and
Guttari also posit this concept in several ways including being and
becoming, especially with their white wall/black hole dichotomy.  with the
white wall being the pre-signifying regime of signs and the black (w)holes
being the opening up of significance, giving rise to an understanding of the
white wall, of the system, however, also destroying the possibility of the
eixstence of this wall beyond a system of signification; the whole white
wall/black hole is understood in the post-signifying regime of signs,
exactly the site of understanding, of reading.

any attempt to elucidate a pre state is doomed to exist in the present.  you
can always say:  'I'm returning to my point,' but that is doomed to a
grammatical direction, propelled forward, your thoughts race even as they
return.  to paraphrase Derrida on Ponge:  the pre is always already present
in the present.

this email was pre sent.

"'concrete operations' precede the acquisition of language, and organize
preverbal semiotic space according to logical categories, which are thereby
shown to prcede or transcend language."-- kristeva, _Revolution in Poetic
Language_.

My post intentionally had a large blank space or canvas but apparently it
failed to come across that way.   I think that this is the preconscious
which is uncharted and at present I see this as roughly the body which is
not accounted for by logical systems which divide 'what is there' into two
categories.  The realm of language is a tenth of the iceberg of 'what is
there' and the realm of the Freudian or Lacanian ucs and Gods and devils is
another tenth on the other end  (the spatial is clearly not any more helpful
in thinking about this than language) which leaves 8 tenths unaccounted for?
(I may well be wrong on percentages)

    At the very least this 8 tenths mediates between the cs. and the ucs.
and this mediation may involve hormones and involve the immune system, etc.
activating switches which might have gray values as well as black and white.
This realm is only now being uncovered by an example of the way it might
work that is familiar to me is the GI system and I know about it because
mine is messed up.  To summarize, there is a theory backed up by some good
scientific evidence that there is more than metaphorically a second brain
located in the GI system that operates independently of the first brain and
when my stomach speaks to me it might discharge gas to the world but also
say "anger" that I speak in language.  both the discharge and the saying of
anger are concrete operations mediate perhaps by cartooning levels measured
in the brain and in the colon but it might perhaps be clearer if you pay a
visit to the colossal colon http://www.preventcancer.org/colossalcolon/

I'm not posting on this as an argument as much as to stimulate thinking as
this is pretty much uncharted territory that poets could explore as well as
theoreticians.

I just caught this thread, as a very irregular list reader of late. I know
Herb's joking about Mathews's review appearing in W magazine. Unfortunately,
Mathews's opinion and actions are and have not been a joke, for decades. For
life today, I'm not sure if it's worth saying any more about it or him. A
variation on Mathews's review can be read as early as 1976, in the preface
he wrote for Keith Richardson's Poetry and the Colonized Mind: Tish (Tish --
a Vancouver magazine founded by Bowering, et al., 1961-69). Richardson's
book is a sorry example of the concept of the social applied to
poetry/poetics in a sheerly ideological, and archly, narrowingly
conservative way -- despite the professed politics of the author. Sentence
e.g.: "Tish imagined that the poet was in the vanguard of global liberation,
an image which had been copied from Charles Olson" (29) -- and that,
apparently, is a bad thing, if you even grant KR's hyperbole.

Some too-painfully-obvious questions: What does Mathews mean by "Canadian"?
Does that include or should it prioritize aboriginal "Canada"? multicultural
"Canada"? What's at all wrong with internationalism? Why is the onus on
Blaser/Zaslove/Nicholls/"you" to organize a conference for Livesay and/or
Purdy and/or "you"? How does he explain that Frank Davey, founding editor of
a magazine Mathews decries (Tish), has spent most of his academic career
writing about Canadian literature, and has still written the best book,
decades later, on Canada's national poet Earle Birney? How does he explain
that poets like Fred Wah, Davey and Bowering have written so much and so
well about history and geography and poetry north of the 49th? And here's
some books "about Canada" by Bowering, for example: The Contemporary
Canadian poem anthology, The Contemporary Canadian poem anthology, Fiction
of contemporary Canada, Great Canadian sports stories, George, Vancouver: a
discovery poem, Rocky mountain foot, Bowering's B.C.: a swashbuckling
history, Seventy-one poems for people, Burning water (and he's also got one
on Prime Ministerial history -- which incidentally would be interesting to
cf. with Sanders's recent 20C history of the USA). And how, anywhere on this
earth, did professor Mathews manage to become such an appalling reader of
poetry? Won't he notice the severely critical and temporal pathos (WWII -->
Vietnam) evoked in the last lines of that Bowering poem, helmet sans soldier
(the poem could even be from GB's 1974 collection, At War with the USA!)??

An interesting irony is it could be readily argued that, in a doubling
counter to Mathews, some of the former Tish poets have dwelled *too much* on
literature in relation to "Canada" since the Vancouver 1963 conference (the
conf. that apparently made Canada in the USA).

Concerning spit flyin' poetics argumentation, and on a personal note of
healthy paranoia, I just want to state for the record that this review by
Matthews is of a markedly different order of seriousness, social
implication, and rhetorical fisticuffing than let's say the "bash-up" I had
with Wershler-Henry as a consequence of a post on Silliman's blog last
October. To put it in a fast, fanciful and sentimental way, if "I" was given
what Poetry magazine got, $1 million, I'd set up an international poetics
institute and would make sure that W-H was there as a primary, vital member.
My sense of Matthews over the last few decades, were he given the
same....there's no need, I think, to finish this sentence.

This is unpretty, outrageous and scary. More signs of domestic
fundamentalist hard time. Larry Felson - a friend and an English teacher at
Oakland High School and quoted here in this article - is also a poet here in

Oakland teacher calls U.S. security agents after teens make in-class
comments threatening President Bush

By Alex Katz, STAFF WRITER
Sunday, May 04, 2003  -  OAKLAND -- Two students at Oakland High School were
interrogated last month by the U.S. Secret Service after allegedly
threatening the life of President Bush in a classroom discussion, school
officials have confirmed.

English teacher Sandy Whitney said she called the Secret Service after two
boys in her English class, both 16, made comments about getting a sniper to
"take care" of Bush.

Oakland High sophomores John and Billy, who did not want their last names
published, said Friday that their comments were made in jest. They said the
April 23 interviews with federal agents left them scared and upset.

Although John admitted he made an ill-worded comment about Bush, one that he
didn't want to repeat Friday, Billy said his only remark was "Bush is
wacked," slang for crazy or deranged.

After the meeting with Secret Service agents, "I was traumatized," John
said. "I was just sitting in class, just looking at the door to see if they
were going to come get me or whatever."

"I was just trying to be funny," Billy said.

The way Whitney remembers it, John "said something like, 'We need a sniper
to take care of Bush,' and Billy said, 'Yeah, I'd do it.'"

The class in question is at times "challenging," Whitney said.

Whitney said she called the San Francisco office of the Secret Service, now
under the umbrella of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, to ask what
her responsibilities were if one of her students had made a threat.

Under federal law, making a threat against the president's life is a crime
punishable by up to five years in prison.

"I wasn't saying, 'Come and get these buzzards,' nothing like that," she
said. "If you say, 'fire' in a crowded theater, that's not a good thing to
do. If you say, 'Let's kill the president,' you have to be prepared for the
consequences."

A few hours after Whitney's call, Oakland High received a visit from U.S.
Secret Service Agents Julie Pharo and Eric Enos, said Principal Clement Mok.

Mok said the agents told him to pull the students out of their sixth period
class. The agents grilled each one separately in a conference room with Mok
present. The boys' parents were not called.

"I can't, in my position, determine what is or is not a national security
threat," Mok said. "It is unusual (for the Secret Service to come to a
school), but we don't get in the way of federal agents trying to do their
jobs."

California law allows peace officers to question students on school grounds
without notifying parents.

"People have a right to free speech, we're not trying to infringe on that,"
said Richard Stribling, a Secret Service official in San Francisco. "But
there is a line there."

Stribling said he did not know about the Oakland High case. He said his
office gets a lot of reports of threats against the president, and agents
determine which ones to follow up on. But it is rare for agents to go to
schools, he said.

The boys said the agents asked questions such as, "Are you a terrorist?",
"What is your opinion of the president?" and "What would you say to the
president if he was here?" Both said they would apologize.

John said the questions were intimidating, and claimed the agents told him
he had no rights after what he had said about Bush.

The agents asked whether his family had guns at home, and whether he
considered himself a good shot, John said. He answered yes to the first
question and no to the second.

Billy said the agents also wanted to know if he had a picture of Bush with a
target on it, and if he had ever been to Washington, D.C.

"I was crying at the moment," Billy recalled. He has not returned to
Whitney's class since the incident.

Some of Whitney's colleagues said they would have used the boys' comments as
an opportunity to discuss the consequences of threats.

"To think the Secret Service would come in, it's just outrageous to me,"
Oakland High English teacher Larry Felson said.

Dorothy Ehrlich, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union's
Northern California office, questioned Mok's decision not to call the boys'
parents.

Legislators in Sacramento are considering a bill backed by the ACLU that
would make it mandatory for high school principals to tell students they can
have a parent present during on-campus police interviews.

"If they thought it was serious enough of an incident to call in the Secret
Service, it should have been serious enough to get the parents involved,"
Ehrlich said.

the signal multiplies


had they a positional sequence,
later to become pronouncement monograms?

time tested measurements
  or those repeat "after-me" conclusions?

where cobalt blue thinkings were
small pebbles under the after strikes

only to be impregnated with repeated examples of shooting=92s
post and post postmortem effects

bolden in blood turned windows
absent, than nothing



to think of a comparison
one is given a character

facts form tunnel means
  and purposeless claw footed engagements

less thought
more address

less impression
more back-account

persistent quotes appear in
certain picture ideas of the air

littered with alternative lag time
only to eclipse to a private dissolve

forgotten little things
forgot even littler things


this left the premise volume counter
  at an  impressionable part two
        1. a photograph was lost
        2. then an entire family

leaving nothing but a disturbed condition
in circular smoke

end periods filled a field of bolted hole rubrics
smoother then a book wet in apology

coda-

imagine if you would
some falling gauze
and a field test

then recall in a vast distant
oil degrees of vagueness
of something doing ahead
in a telephone ring

geez, i don't know about precognition... but just the other day, i
rec'd an envelope in the mails with a little window, in which i see:

        Joe, you are pre-approved for
        a Classic Rock Platinum MasterCard!

        Choose your favorite card design!

let's see:  "Encore" (sillouetted stage with audience arms raised
above heads), "Guitar," "Guitar Solo," or "Turn It Up" (amplifier +/-
knob)...

        Does this Classic Rock Platinum
        MasterCard offer a better value?

        DISTINCTION

        Choose a card that's as individual as
        you are.  Reflect your interests with
        every purchase you make.

and dig it:

        Rely on Capital One...
        the oldest continuously
        operating bankcard
        issuer in the country!

this synchs pretty well, commercially speaking, with cadillac
currently using zeppelin's "rock and roll"---more of the same, i
know... so i trust i don't come off as naive or some such when i say
that, from where i'm sitting, this stinks...

best,

joe

To stare at a blank teal screen
as my palm pilot arms itself
against an insurgance of birds

is to revenge the outpouring inward
of quarks and fissures, a viscous
human thought, in which one can
slide one's fingers around at will,

especially fighting a sliver of hangover
over some crumbs of comfort. You

must have replaced the batteries in
the seasons, or bought an AC
and surge protector for them, because
they glow:

and this noon, just waking, a bit
fried with human thought, I'm
golden brown and crispy, orange
with suffocation, all the rage:

its quite popularly corroborative.
Overseas, soldiers shrink-wrap
this new and familiar war, stickerprice

for retail some dumb pride in
destruction. But I don't
feel like a liberator;

my categorical imperitive isn't
as iterative as a while loop
nested in  shifts of conditional

branches. One could go white
with stolen art.  So I crack
these shells, unscoop their
potential into a glass

of worcestshire or tabasco:
gulp down a pungeant slide
as trees tassle the sky, channel

the wind, over these hardened graves

of human thought.

Joe if the envelope had come from your gut would it have been a Mac Master

I must reply that there can be no thinking without language.  It isn't a

i'm not so sure about this bill...
it's true if you take semiotics as a branch of
linguistics...i.e.---visual thinking occurs in a
"grammar," has a "syntax"----but what if linguistics
were a branch of semiotics?

Do people verbalize what they are doing to themselves as they play
basketball, soccer, ski-jump, or box?

Wouldn't this just get in the way?

Nevertheless, I think you do have to think to play a sport.  I mean, without
any EEG activity it would be kind of hard to play a sport.

Or kiss, or make love, or whatever, no?

If you don't verbalize when you kiss somebody does it mean you didn't kiss
somebody?

CAN you skip along the street AND TELL your body what it is supposed to do?

Maybe this doesn't qualify as experience?

tom, i think i just hate to see "the conquest of cool" taken to such
a patently absurd extreme... i think it's important, too, to be
surprise-able, if you get my drift...

bill:  below is an excerpt from alfred north whitehead's ~modes of
thought~ (1938), which you have to read with due allowance for
whitehead's time and circumstances... perhaps you have already read
it?... in any case this excerpt follows after a discussion of animal
intelligence and vegetable expressiveness and the like:

Of all the ways of expressing thought, beyond question language is
the most important.  It has been held even that language is thought,
and that thought is language.  [I think Whitehead my have Sapir here
in mind, among others] Thus a sentence is the thought.  There are
many learned works in which this doctrine is tacitly presupposed; and
in not a few is it explicitly stated....

[para in which whitehead tries to show how translation e.g. would be
impossible if this were the case, that there persists a "meaning
which lies behind words, syllables, and orders of succession," then:]

Let it be admitted then that language is not the essence of thought.
But this conclusion must be carefully limited.  Apart from language,
the retention of thought, the easy recall of thought, the
interweaving of thought into higher complexity, are all gravely
limited.  Human civilization is an outgrowth of language, and
language is the product of advancing civilization.  Freedom of
thought is made possible by language:  we are thereby released from
complete bondage to the immediacies of mood and circumstance....

[and here's the key statement, i think:]

The denial that language is the essence of thought, is not the
assertion that thought is possible apart from the other activities
associated with it.  Such activities may be termed the expression of
thought.  When these activities satisfy certain conditions, they are
termed a language.  (34-6)

********

naturally i don't offer whitehead as the gospel or some such, but i
think he helps clear up some confusion... and i think a look e.g. at
vygotsky's work on inner speech and such (e.g., ~thought and
language~, ~mind in society~) brings these matters up to date...

that said, i too have a hard time with unmediated visions of the all,
though i'll grant that an examination of where we place our faith (in
whatever---and i can't imagine that any of us operate w/o same, us
atheists incl.) would probably do us all some good...

best,

joe

I've been kinda half-following this thread, but I think Kirby has come up
with a few interesting questions here, namely

"If all experience is by definition linguistic, do animals then experience
experience?"

and

"Do people verbalize what they are doing to themselves as they play
basketball, soccer, ski-jump, or box? Wouldn't this just get in the way?"

to which I'd add . . . are jazz musicians thinking, in language, when they
perform? Aren't they rather thinking in terms of tones, chords, melodies,
patterns? Even though I have to use words to describe my idea, do they?

Which is just to say that I'm surprised Derek R has gotten so much abuse.
What exactly is the point or necessity -- or benefit -- of the opposite
position? Don't people (let alone poets) often have non-verbal experiences?
Aren't such experiences actually rather common? I mean, we could bring in
theology or religion or zen or so-called "cosmic" experience if necessary --
feelings that are characterized by saying that they're "beyond one" -- but
we don't really have to. I just don't understand the necessity of saying
"No, no, you have to go through language FIRST before you can perceive the
thing." Well, why, exactly?

I'm tempted to say that there is no such thing as language without a user.
And that, in any case, there's more to language than logical categories. And
that, in any case, one's extra-linguistic characteristics as a poet --
curiosity, attentiveness, attention, to both words and world -- will always
be important.

An important book in my youth was Owen Barfield's *Poetic Diction* -- some
of you might know it. I recall it now because of the appendices in his 2nd
and 3rd editions where he gave quite useful thumbnail explications of Hume
and Kant's philosophy, which I understand may be at issue here. (If he had
known Whitehead, he might not have needed them!)

The subject-object split, for me, isn't something to be celebrated. It's
something to be overcome.

For starters i would recommend Polyani' _Tacit Dimension and the research
that's been done on this.

Another whole domain that hasn't even been touched on is how does a
serotonin molecule address its receptor in my body or mind?  the only way we
have of communicating on this level to the good serotin is to pour more in
to raise levels and herd them around   Much better if we could sing a
lullaby to the good ones?

Nuh-uh o, Bill. ('No' is a koan).

I think you suffer from thinking too much!

Things are what they are and have *real* essences which we, ourselves,
do not give them. They laugh and they play on the echoing green all
day...

You can play with them and KNOW them if you 'kiss the joy as it flies'
so to speak and avoid FORM.


>| Do animals then experience experience?

They experience it too much. Very primitive, reactive, without much
knowing what's going on (i.e. they haven't the brain-power to unlearn
the stuff they are not smart enough to learn yet!)

____________________________________________

The human mind will reproduce nature as much as possible because it
already possesses, objectively, nature's essence, order, and unity. We
just need to deduce all our ideas from physical things (real entities)
*in accordance* with the series given (parataxis) so that we do not pass
over to abstractions or/and universals (i.e. we do not derive anything
*real* from abstractions/universals and we do not derive any
abstractions/universals from anything *real*).

Abstraction is *negative attention* -->
http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=abstraction

Be evenly derived (no useless additions ~ i.e. categories,
conceptualized ideas, names, etc.) and you will not interrupt the
'intellect' (nature's objective essence, order, and unity).

If you do not approach the intellect with the above awareness and allow
abstractions/universals, you will have/perceive nothing but **extrinsic
denominations,** relations, or at best, with circumstances, all of which
are far removed from the thing 'as it is' (i.e. the thing itself).


>| I'm surprised Derek R has

I'm feeling no abuse. I feel rather giddy (feel like toastin').

I understand what you mean but playing a rhythm is a natural joy.

I am seeking a resource that describes how words in the English language are
divided into syllables. It should involve a set of such rules as

CV - VC
V - CV
V - V

etc. along with any possible exceptions. I have been looking around a bit
and can't find anything. Maybe somebody here knows where to go?

I'd also be interested in locating a database file of English words that has
them broken into syllables. Like a full dictionary of words, not a
single-word search engine. And just the words themselves, not words and
definitions etc.

No, they don't verbalize when they play basketball, but they do hear a
sportscaster do play by play, and when they kiss, they hear movie music.

MONDAY MAY 12 [8:00pm]
MARY ANN SAMYN AND JACQUELINE WATERS
Mary Ann Samyn is the author of Rooms by the Sea, Captivity Narrative, and
Inside the Yellow Dress. Her poems have appeared in Denver Quarterly, Verse=
,
The Ohio Review and elsewhere. She lives in West Virginia. Bim Ramke notes:
"Everything is just about right to describe the scope of this voice, this
amazing book by one of our truly significant poets."

Jacqueline Waters=B9 book, A Minute Without Danger, was published by
Adventures in Poetry in September 2001. More recent poems have appeared in
6x6 and Boston Review, with work forthcoming in Insurance. Bill Berkson
writes: "Jacqueline Waters pours cold water on modern poetry=B9s flagging
aspirations and ironies, and kicks up some new ones. Sharp and candid in
true urban measure, she lines up variable depths...hence poems of high
drama, contemplative, exhilirating."

WEDNESDAY MAY 14 [8:00pm]
BOB PERELMAN AND FRANCIE SHAW
Bob Perelman and Francie Shaw lived in the Bay Area from 1976 to 1990.
There, Shaw had a one-woman installation show at 80 Langton Street and
collaborated extensively with poets. She took part in collaborative
performances with Perelman and musician Larry Ochs; created book covers for
numerous poets, including Robert Grenier, David Bromige and Lyn Hejinian;
designed costumes for the Margaret Jenkins Dance Troupe and sets for Poets
Theater. She taught art at the Sierra School from 1984 until 1990. That yea=
r
she and Perelman moved to Philadelphia, where she taught art at Friends
Select School until 1997. Since then she has shown her work in Philadelphia
and New York (A.I.R. Gallery).

Perelman, a central figure in the group that has become known as the
Language Poets, has edited Hills magazine, organized and curated the Talks
Series, organized performances of the Zukofskys' "A"-24, and participated i=
n
various art ventures, including 80 Langton Street (now Langton Arts) and
Poets Theater. He now teaches at the University of Pennsylvania. He is the
author of 16 books of poetry, including Ten to One and The Future of Memory=
;
and 2 critical books, The Trouble with Genius and The Marginalization of
Poetry. He has edited two collections of poets' talks, Hills Talks and
Writing/Talks. Playing Bodies, Perelman and Shaw's painting/poem
collaboration, is forthcoming from Granary Books later this year.

NASIRIYA, Iraq?The fog of war comes sometimes with a
certain odour, and cutting through its layers, like
cutting through an onion, can bring tears to the eyes.

Such is the case with what is far and away the most
oft-told story of the Persian Gulf War II ? the saga of
Saving Private Lynch.

Branded on to our consciousness by media frenzy, the
flawless midnight rescue of 19-year-old Private First
Class Jessica Lynch hardly bears repeating even a month
after the fact.

Precision teams of U.S. Army Rangers and Navy Seals,
acting on intelligence information and supported by four
helicopter gunships, ended Lynch's nine-day Iraqi
imprisonment in true Rambo style, raising America's
spirits when it needed it most.

All Hollywood could ever hope to have in a movie was there
in this extraordinary feat of rescue ? except, perhaps,
the truth.

So say three Nasiriya doctors, two nurses, one hospital
administrator and local residents interviewed separately
last week in a Toronto Star investigation.

The medical team that cared for Lynch at the hospital
formerly known as Saddam Hospital is only now beginning to
appreciate how grand a myth was built around the four
hours the U.S. raiding party spent with them early on
April Fool's Day.

And they are disappointed.

For Dr. Harith Houssona, 24, who came to consider Lynch a
friend after nurturing her through the worst of her
injuries, the ironies are almost beyond tabulation.

"The most important thing to know is that the Iraqi
soldiers and commanders had left the hospital almost two
days earlier," Houssona said. "The night they left, a few
of the senior medical staff tried to give Jessica back. We
carefully moved her out of intensive care and into an
ambulance and began to drive to the Americans, who were
just one kilometre away. But when the ambulance got within
300 metres, they began to shoot. There wasn't even a
chance to tell them `We have Jessica. Take her.'"

One night later, the raid unfolded. Hassam Hamoud, 35, a
waiter at Nasiriya's al-Diwan Restaurant, describes the
preamble, when he was approached outside his home near the
hospital by U.S. Special Forces troops accompanied by an
Arabic translator from Qatar.

"They asked me if any troops were still in the hospital
and I said `No, they're all gone.' Then they asked about
Uday Hussein, and again, I said `No,'" Hamoud said. "The
translator seemed satisfied with my answers, but the
soldiers were very nervous."

At midnight, the sound of helicopters circling the
hospital's upper floors sent staff scurrying for the x-ray
department ? the only part of the hospital with no outside
windows. The power was cut, followed by small explosions
as the raiding teams blasted through locked doors.

A few minutes later, they heard a man's voice shout, "Go!
Go! Go!" in English. Seconds later, the door burst open
and a red laser light cut through the darkness, trained on
the forehead of the chief resident.

"We were pretty frightened. There were about 40 medical
staff together in the x-ray department," said Dr. Anmar
Uday, 24. "Everyone expected the Americans to come that
day because the city had fallen. But we didn't expect them
to blast through the doors like a Hollywood movie."

Dr. Mudhafer Raazk, 27, observed dryly that two cameramen
and a still photographer, also in uniform, accompanied the
U.S. teams into the hospital. Maybe this was a movie after
all.

Separately, the Iraqi doctors describe how the tension
fell away rapidly once the Americans realized no threat
existed on the premises. A U.S. medic was led to Lynch's
room as others secured the rest of the three-wing
hospital. Several staff and patients were placed in
plastic handcuffs, including, according to Houssona, one
Iraqi civilian who was already immobilized with abdominal
wounds from an earlier explosion.

One group of soldiers returned to the x-ray room to ask
about the bodies of missing U.S. soldiers and was led to a
graveyard opposite the hospital's south wall. All were
dead on arrival, the doctors say.

"The whole thing lasted about four hours," Raazk said.
"When they left, they turned to us and said `Thank you.'
That was it."

The Iraqi medical staff fanned out to assess the damage.
In all, 12 doors were broken, a sterilized operating
theatre contaminated, and the specialized traction bed in
which Lynch had been placed was trashed.

"That was a special bed, the only one like it in the
hospital, but we gave it to Jessica because she was
developing a bed sore," Houssona said.

What bothers Raazk most is not what was said about Lynch's
rescue, so much as what wasn't said about her time in
hospital.

"We all became friends with her, we liked her so much,"
Houssona said. "Especially because we all speak a little
English, we were able to assure her the whole time that
there was no danger, that she would go home soon."

Initial reports indicated Lynch had been shot and stabbed
after emptying her weapon in a pitched battle when her
unit, the U.S. Army's 507th Ordnance Maintenance Company,
was ambushed after its convoy became lost near Nasiriya.

A few days after her release, Lynch's father told
reporters none of the wounds were battle-related. The
Iraqi doctors are more specific. Houssona said the
injuries were blunt in nature, possible stemming from a
fall from her vehicle.

"She was in pretty bad shape. There was blunt trauma,
resulting in compound fractures of the left femur (upper
leg) and the right humerus (upper arm). And also a deep
laceration on her head," Houssona said. "She took two
pints of blood and we stabilized her. The cut required
stitches to close. But the leg and arm injuries were more
serious."

Nasiriya's medical team was going all out at this point,
due to the enormous influx of casualties from throughout
the region. The hospital lists 400 dead and 2,000 wounded
in the span of two weeks before and during Lynch's
eight-day stay.

"Almost all were civilians, but I don't just blame the
Americans," Raazk said. "Many of those casualties were the
fault of the fedayeen , who had been using people as
shields and in some cases just shooting people who
wouldn't fight alongside them. It was horrible."

But they all made a point of giving Lynch the best of
everything, he added. Despite a scarcity of food, extra
juice and cookie were scavenged for their American guest.

They also assigned to Lynch the hospital's most nurturing
nurse, Khalida Shinah. At 43, Shinah has three daughters
close to Lynch's age. She immediately embraced her foreign
patient as one of her own.

"It was so scary for her," Shinah said through a
translator. "Not only was she badly hurt, but she was in a
strange country. I felt more like a mother than a nurse. I
told her again and again, Allah would watch over her. And
many nights I sang her to sleep."

In the first few days, Houssona said the doctors were
somewhat nervous as to whether Iraqi intelligence agents
would show any interest in Lynch. But when the road
between Nasiriya and Baghdad fell to the U.S.-led
coalition, they knew the danger had passed.

"At first, Jessica was very frightened. Everybody was
poking their head in the room to see her and she said 'Do
they want to hurt me?' I told her, `Of course not. They're
just curious. They've never seen anyone like you before.'

"But after a few days, she began to relax. And she really
bonded with Khalida. She told me, 'I'm going to take her
back to America with me."

Three days before the U.S. raid, Lynch had regained enough
strength that the team was ready to proceed with
orthopaedic surgery on her left leg. The procedure
involved cutting through muscle to install a platinum
plate to both ends of the compound fracture. "We only had
three platinum plates left in our supply and at least 100
Iraqis were in need," Raazk said. "But we gave one to
Jessica."

A second surgery, and a second platinum plate, was
scheduled for Lynch's fractured arm. But U.S. forces
removed her before it took place, Raazk said.

Three days after the raid, the doctors had a visit from
one of their U.S. military counterparts. He came, they
say, to thank them for the superb surgery.

"He was an older doctor with gray hair and he wore a
military uniform," Raazk said.

"I told him he was very welcome, that it was our pleasure.
And then I told him: `You do realize you could have just
knocked on the door and we would have wheeled Jessica down
to you, don't you?'

"He was shocked when I told him the real story. That's
when I realized this rescue probably didn't happen for
propaganda reasons. I think this American army is just
such a huge machine, the left hand never knows what the
right hand is doing."

What troubles the staff in Nasiriya most are reports that
Lynch was abused while in their case. All vehemently deny
it.

Told of the allegation through an interpreter, nurse
Shinah wells up with tears. Gathering herself, she
responds quietly: "This is a lie. But why ask me? Why
don't you ask Jessica what kind of treatment she
received?"

But that is easier said than done. At the Pentagon last
week, U.S. Army spokesman Lt.-Col. Ryan Yantis said the
door to Lynch remains closed as she continues her recovery
at Washington's Walter Reed Army Medical Centre.

"Until such time as she wants to talk ? and that's going
to be no time soon, and it may be never at all ? the press
is simply going to have to wait."

Dear M Palmer

        The books listed below may not be what you're looking for, but they do
devote a section or chapter to the syllable more or less in the terms
you've laid out.  Of course, you may already know them.

Roger Lass, Phonology, An Introduction to Basic Concepts, Cambridge UP.
Heinz J, Giegerich, English Phonology, Cambridge.
Peter Ladefoged, A Course in Phonetics, HJB.
Elisabeth O. Selkirk, Phonology and Syntax, MIT.

Also, Willem J.M. Levelt's Speaking, From Intention to Articulation could
be useful; at the least his bibliography would be.  If you haven't read
that book, I'm sure you'd find it worthwhile.  It's very well written,
very thorough.  Might metrical stress theory also be a place to check out
(e.g. Bruce Hayes)?

best,

Thanks, Bruce H, I don't know the books. I will go investigate.

Added question: Is there a place on the Web that has a dictionary database
of words transcribed into their phonetic values? Again, not the individual
words along with all that extra stuff like definitions etc. but just the
words rendered phonetically all by themselves.

Both a bit long in the tooth, I'd think. And I guess I don't remember the

But I remember the unwholesome ones.

Is the question so much whether or not beings always think in language?
Or is it whether any creature (including lynxes and chipmunks) can have
an experience unmediated by signs?  I wonder if animals see the world
even more powerfully in terms of signs than we do--scents, colors,
postures, grunts all signalling various forms of edibility, horniness,
danger.

It struck me--but I could be wrong--that underpinning this terrific
thread is a bias in favor of unmediated experience.  "Life" good,
untroubled by subject-object split, quite possibly a non-existent Eden:
"language" meddlesome if inevitable, all we've got to go on.  But LRSN's
thoughts re: the breath of God got me thinking:  there's Derrida's
semitoics and Paracelsus's.  Sign could mean symbol or emblem as well as
signifier--the effort of the world trying to communicate with us.  Does
anyone remember that early Oingo Boingo video with the face pushing
outwards against that latex wall?  Can we think of language as the
latex--the covering that's always there--and the face the meaning that
erupts by contorting it?

Personally, I'm most apt to feel outside of language when I'm utterly
depressed-- my body and memories seem to point to nothing outside of
themselves, have no wider meanings or connections to the object world
around me.  But come sunshine and I'm back in sync, emblefying with the
best of them.

More vivid than the Oingo Boingo video to me is the one by Thomas Dolby
where he's singing w/ a sheet of silk stretched tight acrosee his face --
"Europa and the Pirate Twins" or something? Were you blinded by science,
back then? LRSN

Precarious, the hold. The edge
nears, with an animation
reminiscent of Wordsworth.
Undercliff, unstable,
images of Kaos obtain.
Those smoky particulars,
those undefines.

The edge
is made of words, the same
Iloveyou's, hateyou's,
that thrive

in what might have been
our song. Precarious

is what we are, each
on topple-verge,
almost about

to fall. Into the babel,
the babble, the speech

stream that pours
never with pause

beneath the precipice of is.



Best

Aren't humans animals?  But of course you mean species other than human.
I'll give it a go.  What I said was that "meaning" is linguistic.  To the
extent that events mean, i.e., that they are bound within cognition
(knowledge), only humans "experience" per se.  The very concept of
"experiencing" is a meaningful linguistic mediation/creation.   Of course, I
don't want to utterly rule out some small degree of experiencing experience
excercised by dogs, dolphins, monkeys, etc.   It no doubt depends on their
participation in a semiotic system that extends beyond simple instinct and
makes possible reflection, comprehension, etc.  But one has to ask if these
creatures live in a meaningful world, if they their sign system creates one
for them, as them.  "Does my dog have a meaningful experience with a
tree--does my dog "experience" the tree?"  Well, my dog is not in possession
of those words, or of the sign system that allows those sounds to be words.
So the questions are for man, as are the answers.  They are man.  The dog,
per se, is only a dog for man.  The dog doesn't exist in a world in which
there are "dogs."  Again, whatever exists beyond meaning for man exists
beyond man's cognition--and even that statement is semiotic.  Best, Bill

I see your point, Lewis.  But how does one "think" the visual without words?
How can we know what we're looking at, what identities obtain?  How can one
communicate to oneself this visual grammar without words?  And if we can't
think it, how can it be there for us?  Isn't the meaning of all images
contingent upon language?  After all, "image," "semiotic," "grammar,"
"syntax," "what if linguistics were a branch of semiotics?"--these are
concepts, ideas, words.  The concept of "language" itself is linguistic.  No?
 If language is merely one branch of semiotics, one type of sign system, then
how is it that it underwrites all thinking, all meaning--how is it that it
brings into existence for man all the other sign systems?  I feel more
confident not separating language and semiotics into distinct compartments,
or privileging one over the other.  Sign systems mean because they are
language.  Language means because it is semiotic.  Best, Bill

From Travis Baker=92s E-Column, "The Week In Theater".

 "There have been certain shows that I have recommended with vague
admiration. Others, I have extolled with giddy delight, or panned with
bubbling venom. One or two (namely my own) I've gotten on my virtual
knees and begged for attention, but in certain rare instances, such as
now, I find myself struggling to put into words such praise as needs be
heaped in one particular direction=85"

"Five women stand on stage and sing. Without accompaniment, alone
and in harmony, with such props as Sunday School Primers, candles and
simple costumes, they sing hymns, campfire songs, old southern ballads
and schoolyard versions of sacred verse. Mr. Torn has kept the staging to
a minimum, allowing the truth and beauty of Lee Ann Brown, Hai-Ting
Chinn, Anne Doerner, Carolyn Kelley and Cynthia Nelson's collected
voices to stand like five perfect flowers in a golden field.

If ever I lie dying, I want these five voices singing me a lullaby. And whe=
n
my eyelids shudder closed, and when that last breath escapes my lips, I
want those five voices to carry me home."

Ah, yes, Castenada's old Don Juan covered that, right?
What's on the tabletop of cognition is "tonal" and the rest
is "nagual" (is that the spelling?). I've often wondered about
hanging a label like "nagual" on all the rest.

Hmm. This is very Marxism and the Philosophy of Languageish, isn't it?
Volosinov actually says a few pages in that erm, "Consciousness becomes
consciousness only once it has been filled with ideological (semiotic)
content." This seems incredibly problematic to me because it disregards any
possible biological determination involved in cognition. If entry into a
semiotic system forms consciousness, then how are we to account for those
unable to enter semiotic systems due to an absence of the senses often
required to do so (sight and sound, especially)?

Reading Helen Keller or Arakawa recently, there is an interesting passage in
which a voice of Helen Keller's (I'm not really sure which voice is coming
through here) describes a dream she has (before learning a language.. "prior
to teacher's coming") in which she eats a bunch of bananas. An analytical
voice (which I imagine to be Gin's as it echoes things she has observed on
other occasions) notes that the dream suggests Helen was able to make
distinctions in the world and was "not quite as underdeveloped as some
accounts have suggested she was." Of course, this is not science, but would
seem to strongly indicate that language is inessential to at least a basic
consciousness..

About the poets:

Jeanne Heuving is a cross-genre writer with current work appearing in
the magazines 26, Bird Dog, News, HOW2, and Tinfish. Her condensed
kunstlerroman, Crossing Cat Street, alternates between journal entries
and experimental prose; recent poetry includes spare, minimalistic
renditions of flowers. Her publications on various twentieth-century
avant-garde writers include the book Omissions Are Not Accidents:
Gender in the Art of Marianne Moore.  A faculty member at the University
of Washington, she is on the editorial advisory board of HOW2, and a
member of the Subtext Collective in Seattle.

Ashley Edwards attends Reed College and plans to pursue graduate study
in poetics at SUNY Buffalo. She is currently working on a multimedia
performance piece entitled "the hamlet incident," an investigation into
the cultural history of ghosts, to be presented at Pacific Switchboard
this summer. She will be published in the first issue of FO.A.RM, and
she is a regular writer for the Organ Review of Arts. Over the summer,
she hopes to give town lectures, interview livestock auctioneers, and
work collaboratively on a zine about copyright law.

i *love* volosinov (bakhtin, i think we know now?), and no doubt we
can slip in "consciousness" for "thought," if we like... but (for
one, and as bergson showed) we can have consciousness w/o being
conscious of it (which would make of such non- (not to say un-)
conscious consciousness something other perhaps than sheer
semiosis)... too, i don't quite accept that "thought" is all there is
to consciousness, to the mind, if we mean by "thought" its
elaboration by and through language... which is perhaps my way of
disagreeing with v, whose "consciousness becomes consciousness" seems
to place a lot of emphasis on "becomes"---does he mean socially, a
sort of social transaction w/o which consciousness would devolve to
minsky's mere "debugging trace" (yes?) or neuro-psychologically
(no?)... which is why i posted the whitehead excerpt, which attempts
to get at other 'modes of thought' (though perhaps the latter word
would need to be ditched altogether to get at what we're getting
at?)...

this isn't to suggest, either, the existence of a "private
language"... but it is to suggest that what we haven't found words
for---may never find?  may continue to find?---is nonetheless no less
real for that... whether this non-utterance/non-thought is a matter
of sheer interiorities, or whether it's identifiable across the
species, perhaps brings us to the cusp of a more chomskian grasp of
linguistic structure and such like... and that's still entirely up
for grabs right now, cogsci or no cogsci...

best,

joe

the only non-lexical, pre-cognitive, etc, experience is and can only be
appreciated subjectively; it is incommunicable for once an attempt is made
to communicate this experience, even to oneself, it becomes 'an experience'.
once it enters into the domain of language (any sign system really) it
subsumes to all of the codes, implicit and explicit, that allow for
communication within said system.  even the most 'radical' texts are broken
down, explained, made logical through essays, theories, methods of
composition, they are  understood.  when we understand, we enter into a
position of subservience relative to whatever we are attempting to
comprehend.  I understand you.  in this light "I do not understand" changes
from a flac for ignorance (even as bliss) into a potentially revolutionary
statement within a hierarchical system of communicable cognition.

I don't think I really understand this debate and if it's been going for several
years I'm sure I won't do credit to it.  However, here's some questions:

If language is inherent in humanity, and there is therefore no pre-linguistic
cognition, how is it that there are so many different languages?

Wouldn't each culture have had to arrive at their own names, their own slang, at
least, for an as yet unnamed experience?

I think this points to the existence of a subject.

This gets into the awkward problem of a soul, a ghost in the machine, and all
that, but I don't think this can be escaped.

What seems to be being asked is what is consciousness.  Nobody has settled this
in science.  I am not sure it can be settled scientifically.  Perhaps the brain
is too baffling for the brain to understand.  I've read somewhere that it is the
most dense item in the universe that we know about.  Dennett among others has
tried to settle the issue, but other neuroscientists disagree, and still nobody
knows.  Matthew Fox has very weird mystical ideas in which he tries to bring back
the concept of the soul.

So we may be barking up an endless tree here.

>Oakland teacher calls U.S. security agents after teens make in-class
>comments threatening President Bush
>
>By Alex Katz, STAFF WRITER
>Sunday, May 04, 2003  -  OAKLAND -- Two students at Oakland High School were
>interrogated last month by the U.S. Secret Service after allegedly
>threatening the life of President Bush in a classroom discussion, school
>officials have confirmed.
>
>English teacher Sandy Whitney said she called the Secret Service after two
>boys in her English class, both 16, made comments about getting a sniper to
>"take care" of Bush.
>
>Oakland High sophomores John and Billy, who did not want their last names
>published, said Friday that their comments were made in jest. They said the
>April 23 interviews with federal agents left them scared and upset.
>
>Although John admitted he made an ill-worded comment about Bush, one that he
>didn't want to repeat Friday, Billy said his only remark was "Bush is
>wacked," slang for crazy or deranged.
>
>After the meeting with Secret Service agents, "I was traumatized," John
>said. "I was just sitting in class, just looking at the door to see if they
>were going to come get me or whatever."
>
>"I was just trying to be funny," Billy said.
>
>The way Whitney remembers it, John "said something like, 'We need a sniper
>to take care of Bush,' and Billy said, 'Yeah, I'd do it.'"
>
>The class in question is at times "challenging," Whitney said.
>
>Whitney said she called the San Francisco office of the Secret Service, now
>under the umbrella of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, to ask what
>her responsibilities were if one of her students had made a threat.
>
>Under federal law, making a threat against the president's life is a crime
>punishable by up to five years in prison.
>
>"I wasn't saying, 'Come and get these buzzards,' nothing like that," she
>said. "If you say, 'fire' in a crowded theater, that's not a good thing to
>do. If you say, 'Let's kill the president,' you have to be prepared for the
>consequences."
>
>A few hours after Whitney's call, Oakland High received a visit from U.S.
>Secret Service Agents Julie Pharo and Eric Enos, said Principal Clement Mok.
>
>Mok said the agents told him to pull the students out of their sixth period
>class. The agents grilled each one separately in a conference room with Mok
>present. The boys' parents were not called.
>
>"I can't, in my position, determine what is or is not a national security
>threat," Mok said. "It is unusual (for the Secret Service to come to a
>school), but we don't get in the way of federal agents trying to do their
>jobs."
>
>California law allows peace officers to question students on school grounds
>without notifying parents.
>
>"People have a right to free speech, we're not trying to infringe on that,"
>said Richard Stribling, a Secret Service official in San Francisco. "But
>there is a line there."
>
>Stribling said he did not know about the Oakland High case. He said his
>office gets a lot of reports of threats against the president, and agents
>determine which ones to follow up on. But it is rare for agents to go to
>schools, he said.
>
>The boys said the agents asked questions such as, "Are you a terrorist?",
>"What is your opinion of the president?" and "What would you say to the
>president if he was here?" Both said they would apologize.
>
>John said the questions were intimidating, and claimed the agents told him
>he had no rights after what he had said about Bush.
>
>The agents asked whether his family had guns at home, and whether he
>considered himself a good shot, John said. He answered yes to the first
>question and no to the second.
>
>Billy said the agents also wanted to know if he had a picture of Bush with a
>target on it, and if he had ever been to Washington, D.C.
>
>"I was crying at the moment," Billy recalled. He has not returned to
>Whitney's class since the incident.
>
>Some of Whitney's colleagues said they would have used the boys' comments as
>an opportunity to discuss the consequences of threats.
>
>"To think the Secret Service would come in, it's just outrageous to me,"
>Oakland High English teacher Larry Felson said.
>
>Dorothy Ehrlich, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union's
>Northern California office, questioned Mok's decision not to call the boys'
>parents.
>
>Legislators in Sacramento are considering a bill backed by the ACLU that
>would make it mandatory for high school principals to tell students they can
>have a parent present during on-campus police interviews.
>
>"If they thought it was serious enough of an incident to call in the Secret
>Service, it should have been serious enough to get the parents involved,"
>Ehrlich said.

wild comparisons to nature this poem at my own expense
so much of a parallel depends upon poems yet unstated antecedents &
the material quality of  honeyed  palpables, a moneyed parable of urinals
wishing for
an independent existence is intoned at the remaining 400 long vowels
on the tail of this bleak end preen wet fallen patches of poetry
wfp of p fields, or not, the world from the surge punctuated by blueness
dazed stirrings of borrowed titles provide retorts to t'human birth of
aeroplanes
these objects are much more modern than the world will ever be
this poem stretches itself out to the length of a leaf (maple, book?) &
gripes down thru vacancy signs, them details perpetually coincidence

Dear colleagues

The daydreams have been suspended because the daydreamer is touring for a
few months. If you are in any of the following cities and would like to meet
for a coffee please BC me. I would like to hear more about your projects,
swap books, ideas etc. My postdoctoral research is on three-dimensional
poetic structures and I'm interested in electronic literature,
neuro-poetics, performance poetry + + +
Hope to hear from you.

and this just in on the prefrontal cortex so relevant to the continually
ongoing discussions on crazy sensitive poets like me:
NIH/National Institute of Mental Health

Gene enhances prefrontal function at a price

Studies of a gene that affects how efficiently the brain's frontal
lobes process information are revealing some untidy consequences of a
tiny variation in its molecular structure and how it may increase
susceptibility to schizophrenia. People with a common version of the
gene associated with more efficient working memory and frontal lobe
information processing may pay a penalty in adverse responses to
amphetamine, in heightened anxiety and sensitivity to pain. Yet,
another common version may slightly bias the brain toward a pattern
of neurochemical activity associated with psychosis, report
researchers at the National Institutes of Health (NIH).

Everyone inherits two copies of the catecho-O-methyltransferase
(COMT) gene, one from each parent. It codes for the enzyme that
metabolizes neurotransmitters like dopamine and norepinephrine and
comes in two common versions. One version, met, contains the amino
acid methionine at a point in its chemical sequence where the other
version, val, contains a valine. Depending on the mix of variants
inherited, a person's COMT genes can be typed met/met, val/val, or
val/met.

"Since both versions of the COMT gene are common in the population -
they've been conserved as the human brain evolved -- it makes sense
that each would confer some advantages and disadvantages," explained
Daniel Weinberger, M.D., National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH),
whose research team, headed by Venkata Mattay, M.D., reports on how
the variants affect the brain's response to amphetamine in the May
13, 2003 Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, already
published online.

"Genes don't directly encode for psychopathology, hallucinations,
delusions and panic attacks. Rather, there is a very complicated path
between a gene's influence on the regulation and function of a
protein and such psychiatric phenomena," added Weinberger. "We're
especially interested in the COMT gene variants because they provide
insight into how a gene affects the way the brain processes
information - and perhaps how this might ultimately increase
susceptibility to schizophrenia." A series of brain imaging studies
by the NIMH researchers have shown that frontal lobe information
processing is impaired in schizophrenia.

Two years ago, the NIMH researchers reported that people with the
val/val variant had evidence of reduced prefrontal dopamine activity
and less efficient prefrontal information processing, along with
slightly increased risk for schizophrenia. People with val/met had
more efficient prefrontal function, and people with met/met the most
efficient. The met variant results in 3-4 times weaker enzyme action,
which is thought to allow for more dopamine activity in the
prefrontal cortex, as the neurotransmitter breaks down more slowly.

Since amphetamine boosts dopamine activity in the prefrontal cortex,
the researchers predicted that the drug would, in effect, correct a
deficiency in people with val/val - that they would experience more
optimal levels of dopamine and perform better on working memory and
other cognitive tasks known to depend on the prefrontal cortex. They
further predicted that people with met/met on amphetamine would
perform worse and their frontal lobes would function less efficiently
as task difficulty increased.

In what the researchers believe is the "first demonstration in humans
of a genetic explanation for individual differences in the brain
response to amphetamine," they asked 27 normal volunteers - 10
val/val, 11 val/met, and 6 met/met - to perform working memory and
other "executive" (abstract reasoning, planning) tasks while their
brain activity was monitored using functional magnetic resonance
imaging (fMRI). In the double-blind, crossover design, subjects were
given either amphetamine or placebo prior to performing the tasks.
Efficiency, or neuronal signal-to-noise ratio, was gauged by how hard
the brain had to work to maintain a given level of task performance.

As predicted, regardless of how hard the working memory task was,
val/val subjects on amphetamine showed more efficient frontal lobe
function - their brains didn't have to work as hard as they did on
placebo to perform quickly and accurately. By contrast, the
efficiency, accuracy and reaction time of met/met subjects on
amphetamine dropped off precipitously, from placebo levels, when the
task reached the hardest of three levels of difficulty, suggesting
that their information processing was compromised. Another test of
frontal lobe function showed a similar pattern. Val/val subjects on
amphetamine appeared similar to met/met individuals at baseline.
Met/met subjects on amphetamine performed worse than subjects with
val/val at baseline.

These results fit a model in which dopamine activity needs to be
neither too low nor too high for optimal prefrontal functioning. The
brain performs most efficiently when dopamine activity is at a
moderate level corresponding to the top of an upside-down "U" (see
diagram below).

"The combined effects on dopamine levels of amphetamine and high
working memory load push individuals with the met/met genotype beyond
the critical threshold at which compensation can be made," suggest
the researchers. They note evidence from other studies that too much
dopamine activity in the prefrontal cortex may disorganize neural
networks by activating inhibitory mechanisms.

Amphetamines and other drugs that affect prefrontal dopamine systems
are used to treat Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD),
and other psychiatric illnesses, and some people respond better than
others to these medications. Noting that it has been difficult to
predict, in advance, which patients might show adverse responses, the
researchers suggest that, after further research, COMT gene type may
become a relevant factor to consider in managing treatment. About
15-20 percent of individuals in populations of European ancestry have
the met/met COMT gene type.

In other recent studies, researchers supported by the National
Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA) have found an
association between met/met and increased anxiety -- and heightened
sensitivity to pain. Yet, the emerging theme from what's being
learned about effects of the COMT gene val/met genetic variation, or
polymorphism, is that it cuts both ways. NIMH's Weinberger says
preliminary evidence suggests that having even one met predicts a
better response on working memory tests in schizophrenia patients
after treatment with an antipsychotic medication. Moreover, there is
new evidence about how the val variant may increase risk for such
psychotic illness.

Mayada Akil, M.D., Joel Kleinman, M.D., and colleagues in the NIMH
Clinical Brain Disorders Branch, examined expression of the gene that
codes for tyrosine hydroxylase, the enzyme that makes dopamine, in
the brains of 23 deceased normal subjects. In the March 15, 2003
Journal of Neuroscience, they report that the gene turns-on more in
neurons projecting to the striatum (an area in the middle of the
brain) in people who inherited two copies of the COMT val variant
than in those with only one copy of the val variant. The higher
expression of the tyrosine hydroxylase gene reflects higher dopamine
synthesis, and presumably, higher activity of dopamine neurons.

Evidence suggests that the val variant likely triggers more dopamine
activity in the striatum indirectly, by dampening prefrontal dopamine
activity. A resulting weak prefrontal signal-to-noise ratio gets
telegraphed to the lower brain areas by other neurons projecting from
the prefrontal cortex, disinhibiting the dopamine neurons projecting
to the striatum, the researchers speculate. Such a seesaw pattern of
decreased dopamine in the prefrontal cortex and increased dopamine in
the striatum has been implicated as a mechanism related to
schizophrenia and psychosis in humans. Animal studies modeling
possible brain mechanisms in schizophrenia have also observed this
pattern.

These val-influenced variations "slightly bias humans toward the
expression of two biological phenomena associated with schizophrenia:
abnormal prefrontal function and up-regulated striatal dopamine
activity," suggest the researchers.

Many mysteries still surround the COMT gene's possible role in
schizophrenia and other psychiatric illness. For example, last Fall a
team of researchers in Israel reported finding strong associations
between other parts of the COMT gene and schizophrenia.

Researchers who participated in the amphetamine study also included:
Drs. Terry Goldberg, Francesco Fera, Ahmad Hariri, Alessandro
Tessitore, Michael Egan, Bhaskar Kolachana, Joseph Callicott, NIMH.
Also participating in the postmortem study were: Drs. Bhaskar
Kolachana, Debora Rothmond, Thomas Hyde, Daniel Weinberger, NIMH.
but a sentence like this:"The higher expression of the tyrosine hydroxylase
gene reflects higher dopamine
synthesis, and presumably, higher activity of dopamine neurons." leaves one
to wonder looking at a photo of this activity just what in the h those
tyrosine hydroxylase genes are saying to their offspring?

Sex differences of brain serotonin synthesis in patients with irritable
bowel syndrome using a-[11C]methyl-l-tryptophan, positron emission
tomography and statistical parametric mapping.

Nakai A, Kumakura Y, Boivin M, Rosa P, Diksic M, D'Souza D, Kersey K.

Fukui Medical University School of Medicine, Fukui, Japan.

BACKGROUND: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is the most common functional
bowel disorder and has a strong predominance in women. Recent data suggest
that the brain may play an important role in the pathophysiology of IBS in
the brain-gut axis. It is strongly suspected that serotonin (5-HT), a
neurotransmitter found in the brain and gut, may be related to the
pathophysiology of IBS. It is reported that a 5-HT3 antagonist is effective
only in female patients with diarrhea-predominant IBS.

OBJECTIVE: In the present study, 5-HT synthesis was measured using positron
emission tomography, with a-[11C]methyl-l-tryptophan as the tracer, in
patients with IBS. The aim of the present study was to compare 5-HT
synthesis in the IBS patients with that in the controls, and to compare 5-HT
synthesis between male and female IBS patients.

METHODS: Six male and six female nonconstipated IBS patients were scanned.
Age-matched healthy volunteers were scanned as controls. Eighty minute
dynamic scans were performed. Functional 5-HT synthesis images were analyzed
using statistical parametric mapping.
RESULTS: 5-HT synthesis was greater only in the female IBS patients in the
right medial temporal gyrus (multimodal sensory association cortex) compared
with the female controls (P<0.001).

CONCLUSIONS: The greater brain 5-HT synthesis in the female IBS patients
than in the controls may be related to the pathological visceral pain
processing of the IBS patients, a larger female predominance of the
disorder, and the sex difference of the efficacy of the 5-HT3 antagonist in
treatment[

and reverting to my poems on watching the war as real reality TV, this study
suggests that seeing Bush waging war was good for my mental health:

MU STUDY SHOWS REALITY TELEVISION HAS POSITIVE IMPACT ON VIEWERS

COLUMBIA, Mo. -- Channel surfers across the country are finding it
increasingly difficult to avoid a reality television program.
According to recent Nielsen ratings, shows such as Survivor, American
Idol, Fear Factor, Big Brother and The Bachelor are attracting more
than 18 million viewers per episode. Many people say these shows
possess no redeeming value and are simply blatant voyeurism. However,
a researcher at the University of Missouri-Columbia discovered these
shows actually have a positive impact on viewers.

"Entertainment needs are met through reality television because these
shows allow people to make comparisons with media images --
comparisons that ultimately help them feel better about themselves
and their personal circumstances," said Cynthia Frisby, assistant
professor of advertising at the Missouri School of Journalism at MU.

In the study, participants ranging in age from 19 to 29 years old --
similar to the 18 to 34 age group most attracted to reality
television -- completed a survey to measure their moods and thoughts
regarding reality television. The survey indicated 78 percent were
regular viewers of reality shows. They then watched a 40-minute
segment of Joe Millionaire while recording their reactions to the
program. Another survey was taken immediately following the episode.

Frisby found that the participant's exposure to reality television
resulted in a positive increase in mood state, with no difference
between men and women. Interestingly, Frisby said, of all the
gratifications obtained, viewers reported watching reality shows
specifically to make comparisons, the factor that determined
entertainment value.

Frisby believes the results of this research can be used to provide
new insights concerning psychological, cognitive and behavioral
processes that motivate television viewing preferences and program
choice.

"Television and other media provide the thrill of observing danger
without allowing people to suffer consequences," Frisby said.
"Audiences know that when the curtain comes down and the lights come
on in the theater, everything is back to the way it is. That's what
reality television does for the regular viewer. These shows are
distracting from today's tragic events and give viewers an outlet for
watching others overcome hardships, escape danger, live in a
rainforest, learn to survive under the roughest conditions, and yes,
find love."

Hi Herb (et al.),

The reading is tonight at 8:00 at South Side on Lamar. From I-30, take the
Lamar St. exit in downtown Dallas and go south on Lamar. It's just a couple
of blocks down the street, big red brick building with HUGE sign on top.
Park at the diner across the street. Take the lobby elevator to the basement
and look for signs. Hope to see you there.

Brian

For those who need a reminder:

Hoa Nguyen and Dale Smith edit the fine literary magazine Skanky Possum and
run Skanky Possum Press from their home in Austin. Please check out their
top-notch website with their constantly changing addendum, The Possum Pouch,
at http://www.skankypossum.com.

Hoa is the author of Dark, Parrot Drum, and Your Ancient See Through. Her
work also appeared in An Anthology of New (American) Poets in 1998. Small
Press Traffic has said accurately of her writing, perhaps paraphrasing
Shahid Ali, that "Her poetry is small in its physical space but looms large
in the psychic state, condensing [...] a variety of domestic and political
details into a web so fine you could pass it through a wedding ring."

Dale is the author of American Rambler, an exacting tour through the
American wilderness alongside explorer Cabeza de Vaca, with constant hints
of Creeley's attention to language and Dorn's attention to the myth of the
American west. Small Press Traffic says of Dale's work that it is always
surprising, ranging from elegiac to formally combustible, but always with a
romantic Western undercurrent. He is a frequent commentator, reviewer, and
interviewer of poetry and poets at places like Jacket and the Austin
Chronicle.

Not usually, but that's not the point.  They wouldn't know they are playing
these games without language, without their participation in that semiotic
system.  The words/concepts of soccer, boxing, etc. wouldn't exist--and
therefore the "games" wouldn't exist.  Actions exist, sure.  Events exist.
But they don't exist "as actions and events" outside of language because they
have no meaning beyond language's borders.  There are no "actions" and
"events" in a dog's world, for example.  Those are concepts man and only man
applies, language applies.

The issue has always been whether language acts as window on a pre-existant
world already charged with meaning, or in fact creates that world within its
hermetic boundaries.  If the latter, then humanity itself is a linguistic
product.  "The thing in itself" is a meaningful idea.  I merely submit that
the thing is always the word, not some object beyond the word.  Eliot clearly
understood this.  Pound was at least at the door, if not quite through it.
On the other hand, Pound's focus was always on language, on clarity against
the vague.  He understood that whether or not "things" come into clear focus
for us, i.e., into being for us, depends on language.  Best, Bill

<< bill:  below is an excerpt from alfred north whitehead's ~modes of
thought~ (1938), which you have to read with due allowance for
whitehead's time and circumstances... perhaps you have already read
it?... in any case this excerpt follows after a discussion of animal
intelligence and vegetable expressiveness and the like:

Of all the ways of expressing thought, beyond question language is
the most important.  It has been held even that language is thought,
and that thought is language.  [I think Whitehead my have Sapir here
in mind, among others] Thus a sentence is the thought.  There are
many learned works in which this doctrine is tacitly presupposed; and
in not a few is it explicitly stated....

[para in which whitehead tries to show how translation e.g. would be
impossible if this were the case, that there persists a "meaning
which lies behind words, syllables, and orders of succession," then:]

Let it be admitted then that language is not the essence of thought.
But this conclusion must be carefully limited.  Apart from language,
the retention of thought, the easy recall of thought, the
interweaving of thought into higher complexity, are all gravely
limited.  Human civilization is an outgrowth of language, and
language is the product of advancing civilization.  Freedom of
thought is made possible by language:  we are thereby released from
complete bondage to the immediacies of mood and circumstance....

[and here's the key statement, i think:]

The denial that language is the essence of thought, is not the
assertion that thought is possible apart from the other activities
associated with it.  Such activities may be termed the expression of
thought.  When these activities satisfy certain conditions, they are
termed a language.  (34-6)

********

naturally i don't offer whitehead as the gospel or some such, but i
think he helps clear up some confusion... and i think a look e.g. at
vygotsky's work on inner speech and such (e.g., ~thought and
language~, ~mind in society~) brings these matters up to date...

that said, i too have a hard time with unmediated visions of the all,
though i'll grant that an examination of where we place our faith (in
whatever---and i can't imagine that any of us operate w/o same, us
atheists incl.) would probably do us all some good...

best,

joe >>

Joe, I have read Whitehead, and the passage you quote is known to me.  But I
thank you mucho for the reminder.  It's been a while since I engaged him.
Yes, Whitehead is a bit out of date, but he certainly was on at least some of
the money.  I've always thought him incomplete on the translation bit.
Translation, i.e., a transparency between languages, is in fact impossible
precisely because of language's structural nature.  Different languages are
structurally different.  But enough overlap occurs to produce meaningful
facsimiles.  And one's own native structure, so to speak, inevitably fills in
blanks.  One may argue that it is precisely the blanks which make the facs
imiles possible (but that's another discussion for another time).

Much of the "confusion" stems from the conventional separation of speech and
writing, as you no doubt know:  speech being the immanent expression of
thought, and writing the also-ran imitation of speech.  What we should do,
actually (and I certainly didn't say this first), is to reverse the
privilege, or rather to erase privilege altogether.  Speech is  writing,
writing is speech, i.e., in order to make meaning, speech must obey the
structure of the semiotic system.  So language, whether spoken or written,
obtains meaning not from any natural nexus with thought (since thought =
language), but rather by participating in the relational semiotic system.

Even nonsense is meaningful as nonsense.  Without language, there would be no
nonsense.  In other words, nonsense makes sense.  The reverse is likewise
true.  Poets often count on this mutual invasion, on the nonsense within
sense, the sense within nonsense.

And I certainly agree with you(as I've already suggested in a previous post)
that one must at least respect faith-based, seeming unmediated (though they
never are, actually) claims.  You never know what you cannot know.  Best,
Bill

bill, check, thanks... i *do* think language is constitutive of
reality... my reason for bringing in whitehead was to suggest that,
even under the rubric of "thought," there might be other "activities"
(whitehead's term) that are constitutive of reality... no doubt
language remains homo sapien's signal semiotic system, if we mean by
this strange word (language, that is) writing, speaking, uttering,
scribbling, reading, translating, and so forth (and if we allow that
it is chiefly from this semiotic system that mathematical languages
usher forth... which might have had something to do with the
logical-mathematical bind russell and whitehead ran into in composing
their ~principia~---but hey, this is an armchair speculation at
best)...

anyway, one of the things that i'm concerned about, too, is how the
discipline of english studies tends to discipline speculation
regarding that which is not language (assuming we can at least point
to such a thing)... clearly poets have, in what some will say is
their occasionally benighted states, presumed an outside to language,
which of course entails language but does not consist solely *of*
language, is not reducible to language, etc., and which is not simply
about the knowledge that comes of signs, either (spicer's theory of
correspondence might fit this bill, b/c his sense of dictation seems
to me to encode alterities of various sorts)... the more radically
empiricist view (i'd say) in which language processing becomes,
strictly speaking, a matter of cognition (= what we used to call
thought), reaches a sort of systemic ne plus ultra in the work e.g.
of mark turner, his notion of "cognitive rhetoric" (see ~reading
minds:  the study of english in the age of cognitive science~)...
can't say i can go, mself, where turner would want us to go...

best,

joe

This sounds very Christian.  In the beginning was the Word, and all that.  Eliot
would have been Anglican, as I recall, so would have been in on this.  Is that
what you mean?  I think I am beginning to understand this idea.

I'm still not sure that I frame the experience of going #2 with words.  I suppose
the control would be to find somebody who is incapable of using words of any
kind, but who still functions, and can go #2, #1, etc., in the right places, and
even manage to flush, and who can maybe play ping pong on the side.  But how
would such a person keep score?

Are you tehn suspicious of language, as in "language is a virus from outer
space," or are you arguing that we should be obedient to the Word, as an Anglican
like Eliot would want us to be?  Or is this a false dichotomy, and there is yet
some other framework?  You mentioned Eliot, so I was thinking of the Anglicanism,
but maybe that's not what was meant.

This in from Nathaniel Tarn in New Mexico, where the police go to some
lengths, it would seem:

HEADLINE OF SANTA FE "NEW MEXICAN," MAY 9, 2003

(Beginning of front page lead article):
"Protesters planning to demonstrate during President Bush's visit to
Santa
Fe this weekend can make a reservation with Santa Fe police ahead of
time
for their arrest.
""Should a person choose to be arrested in order to make their
statement, we
can arrange that upfront" said Police Chief Beverley Lennen.
  " By reserving arrest times, Lennen believes people can avoid getting
hurt
because authorities won't be caught offguard.
.........
"Only performers, ticket-holders and credentialed media will be allowed
entry (for a dance institute performance: Laura B. attending, W. not
sure).
Nobody else will be allowed to approach the building without
consequences,
Lennen said."
  I KID YOU NOT.

I don't think anybody said language determines what will happen in the sense
I think you mean.  Language inscribes meaning to those events, as events.
Language "determines," so to speak, that raw data will be comprehended "as
events."  Free will also is an idea and therefore linguistically contingent
for its very existence as an idea.  Nowhere in the idea of free will is there
a place for complete freedom.  Even the idea posits restrictions.  We are
never free to choose the undoing of choices, for example.  Freedom doesn't
actually come into being until a choice is made, until the will exercises its
power.  But at that very moment freedom is lost since the choice cannot be
undone.  The very exercise of freedom reveals its dependence on the prison.

These restrictions are inevitable since something utterly free would be
non-contingent, and that's impossible.  Everything in the human world depends
on something else for its identity.

As for language's mediation:  those who posit a unified self nevertheless
assume that this self mediates experience.  I suppose one might argue that
mediation necessarily involves an element of determination.  (But this
determinism, a minus for freedom, conceals its own indeterminacy, a
coextensive plus for freedom).  Now if the self is linguistic--see?  There
can be no experience without a self, a subject, right?  Therefore there can
be no experience without language which produces both the subject and the
object.  Of course there can be no absolute division between categories.  The
divide is provisional at best.  Both the subjective and the objective invade
and occupy each other.  Quantum physicists have been dealing with that for a
long time, i.e., the "essential" indeterminacy of the universe.  Considering
what's been going on in Physics, language philosophy seems a bit tame.  Best,
Bill

Well, the Word is God, or Christ, in the scriptures.  It is worth noting that
God speaks ("Let there be light," for example) and light is created.  So
language precedes event.  But here we are still dealing with an absolute,
divine source that is not bound by language.  We have the WORD, not the word
among many words.  Sorry for the confusion, if I'm the cause.

Eliot became "a royalist and a Catholic" because, as he makes clear in his
writings on culture, Europe's loss of cultural homogeneity is tragedy.  No
doubt his disgusting anti-Semitism stems from this belief.

The religion bit is part of that sweep.  Whether or not a God exists (Eliot
appeared to have developed a kind of faith), what matters for Eliot is that
the masses exist as a united culture.  However, Eliot never swerved from the
view that God, the absolute, is unknowable, UN-demonstrable (in that sense
unreal) for man.  We have only the language which posits its existence, and
the language is full of contingencies, the idea of an absolute clearly
dependent on these contingencies.  Irony irony.

All of this can be found, admittedly in strictly philosophical terms, in his
dissertation.  In that dissertation he corrects F. H. Bradley, replacing that
philosopher's claim for a non-mediated immediate experience with his own
"structuralist/deconstructive" view.  In vital ways, this view provides a
precursor to Derrida.  His later essays and poetry maintain this view, but to
get at it one must get past the religious trappings.  Best, Bill

Here is some basic info on Ted Joans, from www.beatmuseum.org:

Ted Joans
Born: July 4, 1928
Place of Birth: Cairo, Illinois=20
Ted Joans was born Theodore Jones on July 4, 1928 on a riverboat in Cairo,=
 Illinois. His father, a riverboat entertainer, put him off the boat in=
 Memphis at age twelve and gave him a trumpet. He is a painter, a trumpeter,=
 and a jazz poet. His jazz poems are collected in a book called "Black=
 Pow-Wow." He earned a degree in Fine Arts from Indiana University, and in=
 1951 joined "the Bohemia of Greenwich Village, USA." He has since recited=
 his poems in coffeehouses in New York and in the middle of Saraha Desert.=
 He has lived in Harlem, New York, Bloomington, Indiana, Haarlem, the=
 Netherlands, and even Timbuktu. His books include:=20
=B7       Funky Jazz Poems=20
=B7       Beat Poems=20
=B7       All of T.J. and No More=20
=B7       The Truth=20
=B7       The Hipsters (a book of collages)=20
=B7       The Truth=20
=B7       Afrodisia=20
=B7       A Black Pow Wow of Jazz Poems=20
His work is characterized by black nationalism, or a black consciousness, a=
 strong rhythm, and a musical language and sensibility closely linked to the=
 blues and most importantly to best of the avant-garde jazz. His style is=
 associated with the oral tradition of African-American writing but also to=
 the Beat Generation. Joans, along with Kerouac, Corso, Ginsberg, and Amiri=
 Baraka began their poetic careers in the artistic haven of Greenwich=
 Village in the late fifties and early sixties. Joans, though, has expanded=
 his work and embraced more serious jazz-inflected sounds, and Black Power.=

Ted was a sweet, kind man, with more than a little amiable conman about=20
him. I knew him over the years in Paris, when he was dividing his time=20
between Timbuktu (winters) and Paris.

Ted was by his own account the inventor of "rent-a-poet," a beat era=20
money-maker. The idea was that otherwise boring people could rent a poet=20
for a party, thereby livening up the event. He claimed to have had a few=20

Ted spoke slowly and softly and incessantly. He was very good company. I'm=

"Poetic form made of language relies on rhythm and musical effects that are
known with our entire bodies, carried forward by poets working out of
tradition and carried over by listeners receiving the work.  In addition,
poetic form relies on effects of meaning that, in their metaphorical and
imaginative reach, cannot be taken up completely in any single moment of
reception.  The semantic dimension of poetry is an open unfolding one,
stemming from both  composition and reception.  No poetic utterance is
absorbed by its context or completed in it's use; as an enduring form,
transmutable across contexts, the poem is always manifold. Paradoxically, it
is the close of artworks that enables the unending open task of such
reception.  What is this task?  It is the task of recognition in the light
of the other, for every work of _poiesis anticipates and is completed by
practices of reception."  Susan Stewart, _Poetry and the Fate of the Senses

-- The reason I went with theology is that this sounds so much like Bishop
Berkeley.  I liked reading his book A Theory of Vision.  He claims that vision is
like a language, and that we have to learn how to see. Subsequent science,
according to Berkeleans has apparently proved him right.  At first, a blind man
who has been made to see looks at a knife and holds his eye, thinking it will cut
his eye because it is sharp.  Only after some time can he understand perspective
and thus distance.  Curves, etc, are all learned.

-- One postmodernist that seems to not go along with the general trend toward the
abolition of the subject is Lyotard.  He has this idea of language games
developed from Wittgenstein.  There are language games that precede us, but he
says that we can ruse with them, change them.  It's sort of like in an actual
basketball game where the game preexists us, but the player can make moves within
the game that aren't announced by the game, or aren't determined (completely) by
the game.  So there is free will, but it is to some extent forced into operating
the way the game asks.

Another way to think about it would be telling a joke.  Even the words pre-exist
you, but the way you tell it is up to you, and everybody will do it slightly
differently.

-- I am having another go at Charles Olson, and reading a Hungarian whose name
escapes me -- Eniko Bollibas or something, and he's saying that Olson's poetics
come out of this kind of quantum physics -- Heisenberg -- Einstein -- he even
says that WCW was writing a similar thing about how Einstein had wiped out time
and space as objective synthetic a prioris and said that they were both
subjective, and would melt into one another.  And Olson is supposedly taking up
where this left off.

Not having read Einstein I was marvelling over this.  I think that since this
time there is some new thing in physics.  Many different dimensions -- dozens
perhaps.  Has this wiped out Einstein, or augmented it?  Can anybody explain this
further?  Science changes so fast.  I kind of get Heisenberg (but I am again not
sure whether Olson really understood this work to the ground the way an
experimental scientist would), but I'm stumped as to how Olson would apply it in
his Max poems, for instance.

Do you mean simply that there's no clear subject, and he takes up one speaker
after another, without clear transitions?

This passage is intriguing and puts to words what I've often had difficulty
expressing.  It's not only "rhythm and musical" effects; I content that that
is only part of it.  Sometimes a poem will lead us to silence, to a state of
"rubato", where the rhythm is free-form to a certain extent.  Then again,
even free-form is a form...I shy away from absolutes myself.  I don't think
that poetry of any type can be squeezed into a mold and left there to dry.
It's organic.  A sentient life form, if you will.

I apologize for not recalling all the finer points of this ongoing
discussion, so perhaps someone could recap for me?

Otherwise, I'll also add that I've experienced this paradoxical unfolding,
shifting, etc.  Poems do morph, shift meaning, etc., depending upon the mood
of the person reading.  I go back to certain poems, see something different.
This is where the nature of aesthetics comes in for me.  When composing my
own poetry, I might  find that there's something I like, something that irks
me, something that I'd change, and so forth.  Taking a poem "as it is", as a
artifact, is something I admit to doing, too--especially when the poets are
no longer on this plane to revise it.

Does this address anything that you've been discussing?

Ter,

I for one am happy to hear aesthetics brought back into the discussion.

Does this imply choice, since there are some poets that are aesthetically better
than others?

Does choice imply a subject?

Subject:      Chicago's HotHouse performance shut down by police
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain

This troubling news comes from Michael Warr, of HotHouse:

HotHouse, the non-profit club well-known not only for its
vibrant, multicultural entertainment, but its enthusiastic
support for other progressive community projects, was raided by
the Chicago Police Department on Friday night.  Put in the
context of growing Chicago police harassment of other
left-of-center organizing projects since the March 20th Lake
Shore Drive protest, this is an attack that we ignore at our
peril.

A rep from the Emergency Response Cmte of the Chicago Coalition
Against War & Racism (CCAWR) spoke with a HotHouse rep earlier
today about what they wanted people to do in support of them.
At this point HotHouse is still deciding their next steps, and
is asking people to assist them by helping publicize the news
about the attack on them.  There is a May 30th court date
regarding the raid, but HotHouse is still deciding how they
would like the community to show its support on that date.
Please stay tuned for details.  HotHouse's message about the
raid follows below.
--CCAWR

HOTHOUSE SHUT DOWN IMMEDIATELY PRIOR TO SOLD-OUT PERFORMANCE OF
LEGENDARY CUBAN BAND ORQUESTA ARAGON

At 8:45 p.m. tonight, Friday May 9, ten undercover officers of
the Chicago Police Department ordered HotHouse, 31 E. Balbo, and
its management to cease and desist all operations, claiming the
non-profit performing arts venue was operating with improper
Public Place of Amusement licenses.

At the time of the citation, HotHouse was transitioning from a 7
p.m. performance to a sold-out 10 p.m. show of the legendary
Cuban charanga band Orquesta Aragon. A crowd of ticketholders to
the 10 p.m. performance had formed an orderly line outside the
venue in anticipation of the concert.

HotHouse management asserts that all licenses for the venue are
in good standing and proper order. Management believes that the
raid, which will cause untold financial losses to the venerable
non-profit cultural center, was politically motivated.

The crowd of ticketholders, many of whom had come from as far
away as Nebraska to see the rare performance of the Cuban
orchestra, left the premises in an orderly manner. The patrons
of HotHouse, along with its management and supporters, are
looking to the City of Chicago and its agencies for answers.

A non-profit performing arts center, HotHouse is dedicated to
exposing audiences to a wide range of cultural expression,
encouraging respect for our ethnic diversity, and promoting a
greater understanding of differing traditions and perspectives.

Saddened by the news about Ted Joans. We were introduced a few years ago by
Charles Borkhuis in Paris. Ted immediately arranged for a wonderful reading
for the three of us in the drop dead beautiful house and garden of a friend
of his. An unforgettable evening that included a surprise performance by
Phoebe Legere whose sultry accordian playing and singing has haunted me ever
since. I learned that Ted loved to travel and frequently did book tours and
readings including many in Africa. Ted liked to tell stories of his beat
days,he was easy going and lots of fun to be around. He called one his
favorite publishers "Nude Erections" (*New Directions*)..I saw Ted once more
a couple of years ago. We spent the day together going to some bookstores. I
had told him about some signed books by him I had purchased from the Skyline
bookstore downtown around 17th and 5th, and the owner, of course, knows Ted.
Then Ted wanted ice cream and we went somewhere and they happened to serve
blue ice cream.. Ted immediately named tthe day our "blue ice cream day,"
I've never forgotten that moment, and I realized that Ted knew something
about memory and imagery that I had planned to discuss next time I see him.
Toni remembers another occasion when she and I went out with Ted and his
companion, a warm, very lovely young woman whose name right now escapes me.
Ted gave us some drawings in exchange for some books. Toni just located a
terrific photo of Ted, his companion, Charles Borkhuis, Toni and myself in
an outdoor cafe in Paris. Ted Joans died one or two days ago at the age of
70.

I'm looking for a few people with whom to study narrative in prose and
fiction.  I live in Berkeley.  My choice would be to read a single writer and
study a great deal of what he/she has written and then move on.  I did this
for several  years with Proust and Walter Benjamin, each of which generated
many related texts.  Anyone in the Bay Area interested?

Dodie Bellamy's Summer Prose Workshop

I will be leading a summer prose workshop, which will meet 10 Monday
evenings in my South of Market apartment from 7 to 10.  The dates:
June 16 through August 25 (no class June 23).

By prose I mean fiction, nonfiction, prose poetry, cross-genre (and
cross-gender) writing including (but not exclusively) anything edgy
or experimental.  It's a good place to present work that feels too
risky or sexy or queer for academic workshops.  The workshops are
totally open-ended.  Five people present a week, scheduling that the
week ahead.  Usually people bring in something 5 pages or less
(copies for everybody) and we critique it that week.  Longer pieces
are also okay, but they need to be handed out a week ahead of time
for people to read.  Each student typically gets a half an hour each
time we critique.  The classes are limited to 8 students.  Lots and
lots of personal attention.  They take place in my South of Market
apartment, which comes complete with snacks and one cat.

If you're interested, please backchannel about cost, work samples, etc.

What a lovely, personal piece on Ted Joans. I knew him a little in England
late summer and fall of 1967 where I read with him and others at the
Edinburgh Festival and sometimes in London. I was young and probably
intimidated not to get to know him as person. But he had a great playful
energy that helped animate whatever scene he was around (and that time a
great love of Hell as presented by Hieronymus B.)  He had a lifetime
dedication to the Bohemian margins and seemed to manage to put up a tent
anywhere and practically survive  (NY, Europe, Mali).  Tho I admit it's been
ages since I have revisited the books - the covers of which(on the
referenced website) still have an innocently wonderful way of  provoking a
serio-comic kind of shameless attention.  I don't know if we are left with
the history of a public character & performer and/or someone whose poetry
will also survive its performed moment as text.


The Bancroft Library at Berkeley acquired Ted Joans' archives a year or so
ago. (They also recently acquired the Gwendolyn Brooks archive and have a
considerable collection of letters - I believe - written by Langston
Hughes).

Of that fifties New York underground - and a writer much more enticed by
social casualties - it was also interesting to see Jack Gelber, the
playwright and author of The Connection recently died. Another astonishing
"realist" cover that had the effect of a needle looking for a hard to find
vein. (Evergreen/Grove Press). Who can forget the seductions of "The Cowboy"
- an actual figure who used to occasionally come to San Francisco plying his
wares to local musicians and totally screwing up otherwise career oriented
lives.

This will tell you more than an email ever possibly could:
http://nomediakings.net

What will you find?
The first installment persevered through various challenges (illness,
intolerant border guards) to create seven memorable events across the
Northeast. The second installment is about to commence with a brand new
gig.

The Perpetual Motion Roadshow is a monthly indie-press showcase on
wheels that features eclectic international talent poets, artists,
writers at small venues in four states and two provinces.

Every month, the Roadshow visits seven cities in one week: Chicago, New
York, Cleveland, Cincinatti, Boston, Toronto, and Montreal. In each
city, the performers will be joined by at least one local favourite. The
second
month's show (May 14-20) will present wide-collar criminal
cartoonist Matt Blackett (http://www.mattbcomic.com) and Kiss Machine
operator-editor Emily Pohl-Weary from Toronto, and Chicago's Bill Brown,

editor of Dream Whip and author of Saugus to the Sea
(http://www.webspotter.com/smartcookie/saugus.html). And, in New York,
the travelling trio will be joined by Vikki, writer and former teenage
armed robber, who will be telling us all about it. Vikki is one of the
editors of the quarterly zine "Tenacious: Writings from Women in Prison"

and the sole editor of the zine "Mama Sez No War."  She also volunteers
at ABC No Rio and at Books Through Bars--New York City.

The Perpetual Motion Roadshow is organized and run by writers, artists,
and performers who believe that independent small publishing is as
important as it is surprising. Theres no corporate budget behind the
Roadshow, just the cooperation of indie-press publishers and admirers
across the northeast, who offer their microphones and their spare
futons. Find out more!

The NYC event happens at 2 pm on Saturday, May 17, at the Soft Skull
Shortwave bookstore in Brooklyn, at 71 Bond St. (corner State). And its

FREE, of course. This will be the New York launch of the newest issue of

Kiss Machine (http://www.kissmachine.org).

Friendly people. Great books and zines. NO BORING READINGS OR
YOUR MONEY BACK.

An Old Story

The Emperor sent me into exile
because the Court Ladies
no longer favoured me.

I tried to appeal
but all I had was a curt

note of dismissal.
You are no longer

one of us, it proclaimed.
Ruminating, far from Rome,
in my Pontic shack

where the rodents nibbled
at my dwindling stocks

and barbaroi threatened
daily with their stones

I mulled my lost causes
and looked for consolation
in the night sky's

ever-rising constellations.



Best

>Nothing Personal / Among the deniers
>By Thomas O'Dwyer
>
>TEXT FOLLOWS FROM WEB SITE INDICATED ABOVE:
>
>"If the victims of genocides cannot depend on the support of the
>descendants of the Holocaust - where on earth will anyone ever find truth
>and justice?
>
>When this column started around three years ago, one of the first people I
>went to meet and write about was Prof. Deborah Lipstadt. She's the
>historian who had just won a place for herself in Jewish legend by
>demolishing once and for all - with the aid of the splendid British
>justice Charles Gray - the lies of Holocaust denier David Irving, who had
>sued her for libel and lost.
>
>Lipstadt was full of praise for the way she had been sustained during the
>long court ordeal by a staunchly supportive media - after all, fighting
>neo-Nazi lies is for all human dignity and safety as well as for Jewish
>justice. How sickening therefore is it to watch the disgusting
>machinations of the Jewish state when it comes to its cowardly refusal to
>speak out stridently against the deniers of the Armenian genocide. If the
>victims of genocides cannot depend on the support of the descendants of
>the Holocaust - when on earth will anyone ever find truth and justice
>anywhere?
>
>After a newspaper item appeared on Sunday saying that a government
>brochure mentioned that a "third generation survivor of the Armenian
>holocaust in 1915" would light a torch at the Independence Day ceremony,
>Turkish embassy hysteria went into its customary overdrive in protest.
>
>In a remarkable act of craven capitulation to denial, the Knesset and
>government caved in and actually printed 2,000 new brochures for the
>ceremony. The revisionist version of history expunged the truth and
>replaced it with a description of the torch-lighter Naomi Nalbandian as a
>"daughter of the long-suffering Armenian people" and her grandparents as
>"survivors of historical Armenia, 1915."
>
>The Ottoman Empire ethnically cleansed and murdered 1.5 million Armenians
>between 1915 and 1918. The Turkish army drove hundreds of thousands of
>Armenians through the Der Zor desert where they died from hunger and
>thirst. What is more, the government sanctioned raids by Turkish soldiers,
>who destroyed whole Armenian villages, not sparing even the women or the
>children. The Armenian population was completely wiped out in Western
>Armenia. About 600,000 survived and now live in various countries of the
>world (including modern Armenia).
>
>Modern Turkey continues to vehemently deny these crimes against humanity
>and fights ferociously around the globe to bury the historical facts. And
>again this week - and not for the first time - we have witnessed the State
>of Israel's complicity in the lie, because it is scared of upsetting its
>only friend in the Muslim states. This is political expediency at its most
>morally bankrupt. Tripping over itself in its stupid defense of the
>untenable Turkish position, the Israeli Foreign Ministry has again and
>again played an active role in suppressing even discussion of the issue.
>
>"Outrageous," is how Deborah Lipstadt, the defeater of deniers, has
>described the Turkish denial. "The Turks have managed to structure this
>debate so that people question whether this really happened." Now
>shouldn't that sound familiar to any Jewish ear? A few months before she
>smashed Irving, Lipstadt was one of 150 scholars and writers who signed a
>Washington Post ad condemning Turkey's persistent denial of the Armenian
>genocide. Among the others signing was no less a person than Prof. Yehuda
>Bauer, the academic director of Yad Vashem. "We and many others have
>accepted the United Nations definition of genocide and there can be no
>argument about [the Armenian case] being genocide," he said at the time.
>
>"I am an Armenian and I have no right to say what is my identity," said
>Nalbandian after the government and the Turks told her what she had really
>meant to say - and would say. She added: "They don't say to second and
>third generations of Holocaust survivors `don't say that,' do they?" What
>if the rest of the world behaved as cravenly in the face of Holocaust
>deniers as Israeli officials do in the face of the Turks?
>
>During a similar row several years ago the then Armenian foreign minister
>said in an interview: "There is some discrepancy between Israel's words
>and their deeds on genocide. Israel has to show a moral authority since we
>have gone through a similar history and experience. What is shocking is
>that there should be any question whatsoever of Israel denying the murder
>of a nation. The sooner the Turks come clean, admit the crimes of their
>great-grandparents, and get it over with, the better for all humanity.
>
>The British for many decades denied responsibility for the Irish potato
>famine that killed an estimated two million people and sent another two
>million into exile - because it was a natural disaster - although history
>recorded full well that the British were taking convoys of food out of
>Ireland under armed guard. It took Tony Blair to admit responsibility 150
>years later, and apologize, to lay the shame to rest.
>
>Turkey's denials of the Armenian massacre will not endure - but the memory
>of Israel's refusal to speak out against the denial just might. "Who,
>after all, speaks today of the annihilation of the Armenians?" asked Adolf
>Hitler when persuading his fellow thugs that a Jewish extermination would
>be tolerated by the West.
>
>Of course there is one Turk you can quote who still commands almost
>reverential respect from his fellow countryman - Kemal Ataturk, the
>legendary founder of the modern nation. In an interview published on
>August 1, 1926 in The Los Angeles Examiner, Ataturk talked about the
>former Young Turks in his country: "These left-overs from the former Young
>Turk Party, who should have been made to account for the millions of our
>Christian subjects who were ruthlessly driven en masse from their homes
>and massacred, have been restive under the Republican rule." When we have
>the word of Ataturk himself, we don't need to be accused of "pandering to
>the views of the enemies and haters of Turks" as one Turkish diplomat once
>wrote to me for daring to question the lie. I assume he meant the Kurds -
>who for decades "didn't exist" either in Turkish myth except as "mountain
>Turks."
>
>The three rulers of Turkey as a triumvirate during the time of the
>genocide were Cemal Pasha, Enver Pasha and Talat Pasha. Of them, British
>Viscount James Bryce said in a speech on October 6, 1915: "The massacres
>are the result of a policy which, as far as can be ascertained, has been
>entertained for some considerable time by the gang of unscrupulous
>adventurers who are now in possession of the government of the Turkish
>Empire."
>
>After the German ambassador persistently brought up the Armenian question
>in 1918, Talat Pasha said "with a smile": "What on earth do you want? The
>question is settled. There are no more Armenians."
>
>Later, Prince Abdul Mecid, the heir apparent to the Ottoman Throne, said
>during an interview: "I refer to those awful massacres. They are the
>greatest stain that has ever disgraced our nation and race. They were
>entirely the work of Talat and Enver. I heard some days before they began
>that they were intended. I went to Istanbul and insisted on seeing Enver.
>I asked him if it was true that they intended to recommence the massacres
>that had been our shame and disgrace under Abdul Hamid. The only reply I
>could get from him was: `It is decided. It is the program.'"

don't blind copy an entire digest back to the list.   How about a little
consideration.

A CALL TO ACTION: PLEASE DISSEMINATE WIDELY

Fight the Consolidation of Police Terrorism in the US:
A call to Action in Seattle, June 2 to 6th, 2003

We, the committee to form a Northwest Federation of
Anarchist Communists, call for a convergence in Seattle,
Washington, home of the WTO protests, to strike at the
heart of the forces whose goals are to undermine all human
rights, criminalize dissent, jail, harass and torture
activists, and
even commit legal murder of people of color and dissidents
alike, in the name of "Homeland Security", "Fighting
Terrorism" and "Criminal Intelligence". We call for all
that have been victimized, or feel that they will become
victimized, by this unprecedented consolidation of police
power to join in solidarity and return to Seattle.

The Law Enforcement Intelligence Unit (LEIU) is holding
its annual conference in Seattle, on June 2,3,4,5 and 6th.
(see
http://www.leiu2003seattle.org/) The organizers of this
conference have invited Attorney General John Ashcroft,
Director of Homeland Security, Tom Ridge (who conspired to
imprison and murder journalist Mumia Abu- Jamal),
Portland Joint Terrorism Task Force member John Cooney;
FBI Assistant Director John Pistole, New York City Police
Deputy Commissioner of Intelligence, and Former CIA agent
David Cohen will attend. The purpose of this conference is
for law enforcement, from local police to the FBI to the
CIA and military, to further consolidate their power and
organization, and to improve "the current state of
intelligence sharing/processing among local and federal
law enforcement agencies; and [to discuss] specifics as
to what local law enforcement can do to better support the
war on terrorism". We all know that the war on terrorism
is a pretext for the war of the State against the
population: people of color, immigrants, and political
activists inside as well as outside the United States.

The topic of their conference include such things as
"Criminal Protest Groups" and "left wing" terrorism. We
all know that people committing such acts as stepping off
of the curb at a demonstration, organizing against the
war, organizing against the rape of our planet, occupying
buildings and workplaces, and destroying capitalism are
considered terrorists by our government. When the
government loses its legitimacy with the people the
response has been to build a system to monitor,
criminalize, imprison, and
murder its subjects, and to remove the line between the
military and the domestic police. We have seen the massive
consolidation of police power after the rise of the
anti-globalization and anti-capitalist movements, the
resurgence in anarchist organization, and the call of the
government to seize Iraqi oil under the pretext of
avenging the horrible tragedy of 9-11.

We have seen the steady rise of the abuse of the police,
from the tear gassing and beatings at WTO, to the murder
of an activist in Genoa. The history is merely being
repeated, since the organization of slave patrols in New
York in 1830's and the centuries of genocide against
native people;
J. Edgar Hoover's repression of Wobblies, anarchists and
socialists during World War 1; the Palmer raids of the
20's; persecution of communists in the 1930's and 1950's;
the murder of Sacco and Vanzetti; The destruction
of the Black Panther Party and the murder of its leaders
in the 1960's; the repression of the American Indian
Movement and frame up of Leonard Peltier; the disruption
of the anti-apartied movement of the 1980's; and now, the
criminalization of Muslims, immigrants, people of color,
native peoples, and activists in the 1990's and to date.
Our resistance to the police state in the US is the
uniting of all people of all color, of all struggles for
self determination, of all defenses against the rape of
Mother Earth, and the struggle against the employing
class.

We call upon all to converge upon Seattle, using whatever
tactics they feel are necessary and prudent to carry out
the goals of their respective organizations and
constituencies; we call all upon all to organize in
affinity groups and coalitions as necessary to resist the
legalized planning for the criminalization of dissent; and
we leave up to
individuals and groups to choose whatever tactics they
deem appropriate to their cause, and that such tactics be
carried out independent of one another when necessary. We
call upon the defense of non-violent activists against the
likely abuse by the police who will likely rise to the
occasion; and we call for this to be the first action of
many to dismantle
the institution of Police Terrorism, disguised as Homeland
Security and its regional manifestations of FBI/law
enforcement partnerships. We must expose this legal crime
network to the people of this country, and destroy any and
all legitimacy they made have.

Corporate America is funding this conference. Starbucks,
7-11 stores, and Microsoft are listed as sponsors.
Microsoft develops the computer infrastructure for citizen
data collection (see http://jps.directtaps.net/) Corporate
America has declared us the enemy, and they are raising
their army of soldiers and intelligence alike to defeat
our resistance to their tyranny. This already happened
last year on the docks on the West Coast of the US, where
the White House called the
leadership of the International Longshore and Warehouse
Union (ILWU) to warn then against striking against the
waterfront employers (the PMA) to protect "national
security", while the employers in an allinace with the
Bush White House and corporate retailers used Taft-Hartley
to fight the
union. This will likely happen with the ILA on the east
coast when their contract expires. Corporate America wants
the cops and military involved in our workplace disputes,
so that they can make us their unquestioning servants
paralyzed by fear.

Our struggle against the proponents of "Homeland Security"
and the emerging police state is our struggle for our
survival, and for the survival of our planet.

In Revolutionary Struggle and Solidarity,

Coordinating Committee for the formation of a Northwest
Federation of Anarchist Communists.

You'll need to track down a copy of the print-edition for
the postage-stamp sized mugshots, but here's the text
of an artickle from yesterday's -Chicago Tribune- that
may be of interest.

Blessing and burden
--------------------

In an informal roundtable, poets, publishers and others suggest ways
to share the wealth of Ruth Lilly's multimillion-dollar bequest

By Maureen N. McLane.

Maureen N. McLane is a poet, book author and junior fellow in Harvard
University's Society of Fellows

May 11, 2003

Late in 2002, Chicago-based Poetry magazine and its parent
organization, the Modern Poetry Association, or MPA, announced that
the association was to receive an estimated $100-million to
$150-million bequest from Ruth Lilly, 87, heir to the Eli Lilly
pharmaceutical fortune.

The bequest created a certain stupefaction, and not just among the
boards of Poetry and the MPA. Upon hearing the news, many
commentators and self-styled culture czars put pen to paper and
finger to keyboard to celebrate, muse and snipe about this
extraordinary windfall.

As any reader of fairy tales knows, gifts can be double-edged: They
can bring delight but also difficulties. Writer Lewis Hyde years ago
made clear in his book "The Gift" that a gift is an offering and a
burden: It binds you, obligates you, ensnares you, even if--as in the
case of the Lilly bequest--it promises to make things possible.

Speaking on behalf of the MPA, President Deborah Cummins, and Joseph
Parisi, executive director and editor of Poetry magazine, seem
grateful and cautious, mindful of the double nature of the gift.

"We recognize the true responsibility as well as the good fortune of
the bequest," Cummins says. "We want to be cautious and precise in
all regards; and this will require a lot more planning than people
understand."

Adds Parisi: "The legal, financial [issues] . . . all have to be
thought about simultaneously; and meanwhile the magazine has to come
out every month. We have to think about all these things in an
integrated way."

Parisi emphasizes that the bequest "will be coming in installments
over thirty years, and . . . is going to be used to form an
endowment." Cummins adds that "one of the clarifications that needs
to be made is that the bequest went to the Modern Poetry Association,
not to the magazine, though obviously Poetry magazine is our most
prominent face."

People in the poetry community are, of course, eager to know what
will be done with the money. While emphasizing that it will take some
time to decide on every allocation, Cummins also says, "we look to
partnering as a way of helping our mission. Are there people out
there doing some of the same things we would like to do?"

Indeed, there may be: The several poets, publishers, editors,
educators and association directors we interviewed made many
suggestions as unofficial consultants, and a number of their ideas
converged: support for education, support for public programming,
support for poets, support for publishing. Here is a selection of
their musings, congratulations, criticism and advice--an informal
roundtable about the Lilly bequest:


Julie Parson-Nesbitt
Member of the editorial board of Tia Chucha Press in Chicago and her
local school council in Chicago

"We need to reach new audiences for poetry. This is an amazing time
for poetry in this country--a lot of young people are into poetry
now. This has a lot to do with hip-hop.

"We need models to motivate kids to read and write. Teachers need
curricula, support, programs in the schools. I work with Young
Chicago Authors, an 11-year-old Chicago organization that provides
creative-writing workshops in Chicago public schools. This might be a
model.

"I hope [the Modern Poetry Association] will work with other literary
organizations and literary programs, because I feel that the literary
community is pretty small and interdependent. There is a critical
lack of poetry publishing in this country. One thing they could
consider is publishing poetry books of their own and supporting other
presses. I would love to see a lot of collaboration between Poetry
magazine and other organizations in Chicago and nationwide--after
all, they have a national readership."


Devin Johnston
Poet and co-publisher of Flood Editions, a small press in Chicago

"Whatever comes of the bequest, you can bet it will produce another
prize. Mother, save us from the redundancy of prizes! They rarely
seem to go to anyone who needs them; and as someone once said, prizes
are for children.

"I do hope that some of that money gets scattered in small
disbursements to shoestring operations. Historically, the Midwest has
not had the institutional support for poetry that one finds in cities
like New York or San Francisco. Poetry could help in that regard.

"More importantly, Poetry could give grants to poets on the basis of
economic need rather than accomplishment. Provision might be made for
poets without health insurance or retirement savings. I can think of
only one organization in the United States specifically addressed to
poets who find themselves in an emergency, such as fire, flood,
eviction, or medical crisis: Poets in Need, at 2639 Russell St.,
Berkeley, CA 94705."


Rebecca Wolff
Poet, editor of the literary and arts magazine Fence, and publisher
of Fence Books in New York

"I can imagine that if it happened to me, it would take a long time
to figure out what to do with it. Maybe they can take that money and
make a little think tank, to think about their editorial policy.

"One reason poetry's become a kind of rockpool is because it's not
part of the curriculum of early learning. It seems that earlier--in
my mother's education--poetry was central to learning language, how
to speak; she can still recite some of them at length. A sense of
poetry as something you could use in your daily life seems to have
disappeared . . . so if someone gave me a hundred million and I was
already established as a foundation, I think I would do something to
promote the early learning of poetry. There are projects like that
but nothing concerted.

"In the grant-giving world there are very few funding opportunities
for publishing because people have decided that poetry should be able
to support itself, that it's a business. . . . It's probably a lot
easier to get grants for performance things and visual stuff."


Haki Madhubuti
Poet, educator and publisher of Third World Press in Chicago

"The first thing is not to do anything--take the money and bank it
and think very seriously about what to do with it.

"Second thing: Give the staff and editors a raise. Men and women who
work in this field are terribly underpaid.

"Third: A deep thank you needs to be issued loud and clear to the grantor.

"Fourth: Reach out to other communities. I read Poetry every month;
I'm not a subscriber, I just buy it off the shelf. This is a problem
we [as publishers and poets] all have--we don't have the resources to
reach other communities with our poetry, with our words. Poetry
magazine should be on all the shelves in all the libraries in the
country--not just in Chicago or in New York but in rural areas, high
schools, in historically black colleges.

"Fifth: I'd suggest that they talk to a financial adviser. . . . At
Third World Press one of the things we did 15 years ago was to buy
property on the South Side of Chicago. Poetry has very small office
space at the Newberry Library.

"Sixth: Consider publishing poetry books.

"It's not like they have to reinvent the wheel--they already invented
the wheel with Poetry magazine."


Eirik Steinhoff
Editor of the quarterly literary magazine Chicago Review

"I will say off the bat that there are more important things than all
this fiddle to be redistributing wealth towards: education, health
care, social services, and so on. That said, I also recognize the
value of cultural capital, and the part, though small, that poetry
plays in that game.

"Whenever poetry--the genre, not the magazine--is the target of
large-scale philanthropic gestures, it's a good sign. In my
experience, philanthropists are an incredibly competitive bunch, and
it takes gestures like Lilly's to cultivate and innovate new areas of
philanthropic attention. If this were the intention, though, the gift
might have been framed as a challenge grant--i.e., 50 percent from
Lilly, 50 percent from other sources. 'Matching funds' is how the
[National Endowment for the Arts] frames it.

"It's a good thing that the money goes to an organization in Chicago,
putting this city back on the map, at least in national news, as a
cultural center. Much more significant than the Lilly gift, to my
mind, are the numerous, home-grown, non-institutional poetry-reading
series that are afoot--in the last two years we've been lucky to have
The Danny's Reading Series, the Chicago Poetry Project, and something
just called the Discrete Series just opened up recently. This is much
more significant than millions of dollars, insofar as it indicates
that there's a lively poetry scene, one that's burgeoning away from
the universities, one that is basically free of charge. The Lilly
millions are just gravy on top, really. You need the poetry first!

"It's a terrible thing for all this money to go to just one
organization. For the MPA to be the sole recipient of this gift is
more than a little troubling, if only because it will allow Poetry
magazine to take the millions as a confirmation of the conservative
turn that the magazine has taken under Parisi--a turn that in fact
betrays the innovative legacy of editorial ecumenicism that the
magazine had in two important moments in the 20th Century: in the
heyday of the moderns--under founding Editor Harriet Monroe--and in
the thick thrill of the postwar generations under the brilliant Henry
Rago. Poetry travels a much narrower circuit than it should for a
magazine with such a legacy, publishing average verse by average
poets, which it will now be distributing to a much larger public.
Perhaps this bequest will allow the much-touted 'open-door' editorial
policy to kick into action again, but none of us is holding our
breath for that."


Marc Kelly Smith
Chicago performance poet, founder of the National Poetry Slam and
slam host at the Green Mill lounge

"It would be nice to have some money in the slam world, and we could
really do something! We reach a giant audience--slammers are in the
schools teaching. I don't think it's a boast for me to say that
Poetry Slam is one of the major forces in heightening audience
awareness of poetry.

"There are other groups in Chicago--Young Chicago Authors, for
example--and in Illinois that are doing all kinds of work out there,
just doing it out of their love of the art. Alice George of Rhino
magazine has been plugging away for years. The Guild Complex [which
runs arts programming and houses Tia Chucha Press]--they still
operate on a shoestring.

"The Slam and Poetry magazine--their roots--they're both
revolutionary outfits, only Poetry magazine moved from revolution to
institution years ago. . . . [But] I've got a feeling that they might
do really great things with [the bequest]."


Alice Quinn
Executive director of the Poetry Society of America, or PSA, and
poetry editor of The New Yorker

"I still consider libraries to be the great waterway [for poetry].
But if you can bring the programming that we do at PSA to other parts
of the country, that would be a great thing. I strongly believe in
having poetry be the anchor of the evening [of a special event] but
welcoming other arts into it.

"Poets' House [in New York City] and PSA came together to talk to
foundations; we realized that we'd be stronger together. If Poetry
magazine wanted to join forces with us, that would be heaven!"

Poetry shouldn't be in isolation; it should live in the world."


William Corbett
Poet, teacher and publisher of Pressed Wafer, a small press in Boston

"I consider this money like gravy--you spread it around like
fertilizer; don't worry about making mistakes. Stay lean and put the
money out to work. Be bold, be generous.

"Put a healthy chunk aside for indigent poets. . . . Spread [the
money] around--but not by creating another bureaucracy, another
publishing organization. Give not to institutions but to poets.

"One thing they could do is buy a hell of a lot of books for
libraries--subsidize libraries on Native American reservations, in
inner cities, etc.

"What's money good for? The same thing it's good for a plumber for:
more wine, more food. . . . [The bequest] won't make one . . . bit of
difference: The poems will get written or they won't. Like Ezra Pound
said, it doesn't matter who writes the good poems, only that they get
written."

"Man knows that there are in the soul tints more bewildering, more
numberless, and more nameless than the colors of an autumn forest. ...Yet he
seriously believes that these things can every one of them, in all their
tones and semi-tones, in all their blends and unions, be accurately
represented by an arbitrary system of grunts and squeals. He believes that
an ordinary civilized stockbroker can really produce out of his own inside
noises which denote all the mysteries of memory and all the agonies of
desire." --Chesterton, quoted by Borges in: Selected Non-Fictions ed. Eliot

Raises the interesting question of whether ten female blue-footed boobies
wld unanimously agree on which male dancing blue-footed booby was the
best.  I'd like to see a study...

this is an amazing festival that happens here. application deadline is

Sound Symposium XII
July 8-18, 2004
International Festival of New Music & the Arts
every second summer in
St. John's, Newfoundland, Canada

There are no limits... Listen...


Sound Symposium is known for breaking boundaries and making connections:
where traditions meet new inventions; different disciplines mix, match and
create magic; late night improv sessions lead into morning workshops, and
the rugged beauty of Newfoundland is as much a part of the show as the
invited artists. Musicians, singers, filmmakers, performance artists,
dancers, actors, visual artists and more from all over the world get
together to share, explore and collaborate.

We invite you to spend some time on this site - check out the sights,
sounds and reviews of past symposia - and open your ears and eyes to our
adventure in sound.

Be part of it. Don't delay - download the 2004 application form HERE.


Deadline is July 15, 2003.



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

From the morning workshops until the last notes of late night jam
sessions, each day of Sound Symposium is brimming with sound activities -
both planned and impromptu.

Since 1983, Sound Symposium has gathered some of the top innovative
musicians and artists from across Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada and
around the world. They congregate in St. John's to soak up the
environment, interact, explore, share, and collaborate. The results are
magic for performers and audience members alike.

Something electric happens when the Symposium's in full swing. Music can
be heard, and seen, everywhere: concert halls, street corners, hills,
parks, pubs, living rooms, WWII bunkers, in the woods and across the
harbour. You may stumble across an installation in a stairwell or a
concert in the belly of a boat.

It all fits in perfectly with the distinctly Newfoundland landscape: the
crashing waves, the jagged cliffs, and the echoes of wind, whales and
seabirds.

The twelfth Symposium promises a new adventure in sound at every turn.
Here are some of the sorts of things we will have in store.

* Please note: all events and guests are subject to change.

Evening Concerts
Our famous evening programs combine the best of jazz, contemporary
classical, world and improvised music with theatre, film and dance. Each
night promises a different blend of the familiar with the unknown -
something for everyone with open ears!

Harbour Symphony
Alerting the entire city that Sound Symposium is here again, a new Harbour
Symphony will echo across St. John's every day at 12:30. Ships take the
form of a giant horn section, taking advantage of the unique acoustics of
the bowl-shaped St. John's harbour. Our Harbour Symphony has made
appearances in Montreal and San Francisco, but nowhere is it more striking
than in St. John's. It's impossible to miss this event, but plan to take a
few minutes out to really listen: the best place to do so is on Signal
Hill.

Workshops
To the experienced artist or curious amateur: try something new! A rare
chance for hands-on learning with internationally respected experts.

Quiet Music Series
As the evening deepens, step into a quiet space - perhaps a living room of
a St. John's heritage home or a darkened art gallery. Get comfortable, and
listen to an exquisite concert of unamplified music performed by Symposium
artists, away from traditional concert halls, background noise and barroom
chatter. After each performance, the audience is welcome to linger, sip a
glass of wine, and mingle with the artists and each other.

Night Music at the Ship Inn
Each night, a different performer or band will take to the stage of the
Ship Inn and warm up the audience with a set of original music. Then the
floor opens up, as Symposium guests and others are invited to join the
jam, and the fun begins. These late night bar shows were among the
highlights of the last festival.


The Ship Inn is a legend in its own right: the birthplace of countless
collaborations, the inspiration for others, and the favoured watering hole
for Newfoundland artists. The atmosphere, music and company will make your
Ship Inn visits ones to remember.

Forums
Deepen your knowledge and attend an informal lecture and discussion, lead
by Symposium guests.

Visions of Sound
Sound Symposium prides itself on bringing cutting-edge installation
artists together to explore the boundaries of sound and visual art. This
coming year will be no exception, with a diverse group of
interdisciplinary artists setting up their pieces in galleries, stairwells
and dramatic outdoor sites. There will be an organized Sound Walk, but
most of the participating galleries and exhibition spaces will have
regular open times. All artists will be on hand at specific times for
discussion. Challenge your perception and open your senses!

Cape Spear Project
Sound Symposium artists join together for late night performance and
improvisation at the easternmost point in North America. The sound of the
waves and wind (and perhaps a whale or two) provide just the backdrop for
music echoing through WWII bunkers. Bring an extra sweater and enjoy the
magic.

Discover the Beauty of Newfoundland
July is a beautiful month in this province make the most of this
opportunity to see the last of the year's icebergs, take a whale and
seabird tour, or hike any of a number of stunning coastal trails. From the
jagged cliffs cutting into the sea to the miniature natural gardens of
mosses and lichens on the barrens, you will be taken in by the landscape.
Feel the space: spend a day at sea, wander the wilderness, or just sit on
the rocks at Cape Spear and watch the waves crash in. Inspiration awaits.

Steven,

I hadn't read this poem in a couple of decades and I goofed it up.  I found it printed
side by side with a Korean translation on the web.  It is also in the Norton Anthology
of Poetry:

The Blue Booby

The blue booby lives
on the bare rocks
of Galapagos
and fears nothing.
It is a simple life:
they live on fish,
and there are few predators.
Also, the males do not
make fools of themselves
chasing after the young
ladies.  Rather,
they gather the blue
objects of the world
and construct from them

a nest -- an occasional
Gaulois package,
a string of beads,
a piece of cloth from
a sailor's suit.  This
replaces the need for
dazzling plumage;
in fact, in the past
fifty million years
the male has grown
considerably duller,
nor can he sing well.
The female, though,

asks little of him--
the blue satisfies her
completely, has
a magical effect
on her.  When she returns
from her day of
gossip and shopping,
she sees he has found her
a new shred of blue foil:
for this she rewards him
with her dark body,
the stars turn slowly
in the blue foil beside them
like the eyes of a mild savior.

                 (1969)

Well, there is nothing about dancing in here.  I don't know how biologically accurate
the poem is regarding the increasing dullness of the booby.  Fifty million years is a
long time to know something about.  And all the things they find are more or less recent
(trash) -- beads, cigarette packages, a fragment of a sailor's suit.  How could it be
that a bird could develop a taste for something that's not in the natural environment?
Anything blue at all seems to go.  Is there any competition?  Same questions I suppose
apply.  Does he have another poem in which some male birds do a dance for the females?

-- I think the question is now why blue, and whether anything blue is equal to anything
else blue.  Do shades of blue count?  Deep blue, or light blue.  Where are the edges of
blue?  Does turquoise at least rate an affectionate tap on the beak?

We'll have to see if we can find a wildlife biologist and ask, or maybe the answers are
on the net somewhere if we look up blue booby mating habits.

If this poem is based on verifiable fact:  Who set up the language game of finding
things blue?  How was it decided, and how is the game perhaps being altered by
increasing occurence of things blue with now so many tourists visiting the Galapagos
since Darwin.

O proud left foot, that ventures quick within
Then soon upon a backward journey lithe.
Anon, once more the gesture, then begin:
Command sinistral pedestal to writhe.
Commence thou then the fervid Hokey-Poke,
A mad gyration, hips in wanton swirl.
To spin! A wilde release from Heaven's yoke.
Blessed dervish! Surely canst go, girl.
The Hoke, the poke - banish now thy doubt

Sad news. (Unfortunately, i am unable to view the
obit without signing in...) For anyone who hasn't
seen the film version of the "Connection" -- it's
well worth checking out. The groundbreaking script
involves an afternoon in the life of a bunch of
junkies waiting for their "connection" in a
stifling NY apartment -- among them a group of
jazz musicians including a young completely
smoking Jackie McClean... the original reality
show! (most of the actors and musicians were in
fact junkies!) the acting is incredible and the
script devastating.

And I may as well throw in my two cents about Ted
Joans: I saw him read not too long ago at Bird &
Beckett in San Francisco; he would always stop in
to read there on his way through town. The place
was packed and it was phenomenal. The things he
could do with a simple theme and his own voice
were truly jazz-like, and it may partially explain
why his books aren't more popular -- it's simply
impossible to get a sense of what they sound like
without hearing him read.

I would like to meet a blue-footed boobie.  In fact, I rather like the
color, blue: cerrulean, sky, turquoise--ah such a palette.
I met a Europan Tentacle Dancer once.  Wrote a poem about him.  He was
cerrulean blue...

On another note, it goes back to that mood thing for me.  Sometimes I'm in
the mood for Shel Silverstein and Dr. Seuss, while other times I want to
read Willie or Corso or...or...

If someone tells me a poet is "good" or that I should just "check them out",
I do.  I often find that there's something there to examine.  Whether I go
out and buy their books or attend their readings is another thing...

Ok..How is this intriguing?  I admit to not having read any of the work
under discussion here.  I could, however, discuss the mind/body

Being neither a theorist of practice nor a practitioner
of theory, I hesitate (not long enough, I see now) to
shoehorn myself in here, but I feel that I must, if only
to point to a little poem by Carl Rakosi I just stumbled
upon, this from *Conjunctions* 16 (its music issue) of
a dozen or so years ago. Enjoy.


Theme



How delightful

                           to discover

on Olympus

                       a god

of Silence

                    (and not a minor

one either).

                      Hail Harpocrates!

How reassuring

                            that you are still here

to protect us

                        against the theorists.


--Carl Rakosi

in *Conjunctions* 16, 1991

This is entirely inaccurate.

Two words: reflexive knowledge. >>

Sorry, this example just proves my point.  Both words/ideas depend on other
words/ideas for their meaning.  "Reflexive" is a cogent idea only because it
is in relation to its contrary (as well as thousands of other words/ideas)
which coexists within the field of language.  Grammatically, anything that
operates reflexively, while aiming to  erase the distance between subject and
object, always ends up placing the subject in the object position,
objectifying it and so changing it, while the subject remains in place as the
knower knowing that object which is to be known.  The reflexive, far from
erasing the distance between subject and object, ends up restoring it.  The
subject which is known can never be the same as the one doing the knowing
since one of them has become an object, not a subject.  The seen depends on
the seer for its identity as seen.  Likewise, the seer cannot come into being
as such unless and until something is seen.

But before we get too comfortable, we must also note that all knowledge is
reflexive precisely because of this interdependency. The mutual occupation
means that subject and object are always within each other, part of the
internal structuring of their definitions.  The subjective guarantees the
coming into being of the objective, and vice versa.

But it is impossible to think a merging of subject/object without the
concepts of subject and object, without the concept of things that don't
merge.  Again, meaning is always conditional.  Any conceptualization of
identity depends on the idea of nonidentity.  The reverse is also true.  This
interdependency is impossible to escape.  The very fact that you offer TWO
words should clue you to your mistake.  "Reflexive knowledge" is a
grammatical structure made up of a noun and an adjective which depend on each
other (in addition to what I said above, since any way you go at this you end
up with indeterminacy, interdependency) to form the idea.  But any one
word--e.g., "independence"--is similarly dependent for its meaning.

Good try, though.  Best always, Bill

this fits a pattern in much of today's media to ignore all but your own
pain--

the Murder of 6 million Jews was not the only genocide of the last century-

1 million Armenians killed from 1915-1923
200,000 Basques killed in the Spanish Civil war
10 million Ukrainians killed by Stalin in the 1930's
9 million Chinese killed by the Japanese in WWII
11 Millions Muslim and Hindu Indians killed after partition of India in 1948
3 million Cambodians killed in 1979
 and many more are all equal to the Jewish Holocaust but no body cares about
these, no films are made and few books find publishers no one is interested
why is that ?

I am at the moment reading and can recommend Clarence D. Ussher's book _An
American Physician in Turkey_ (published 1916) which testifies to the
Armenian massacres in great detail. It's by no means a balanced book (Ussher
was a Christian missionary), but it's not fiction either. Atom Egoyan
(Canadian filmmaker of Armenian descent) used Ussher's book as source
material for his recent film _Ararat_.

Slought Foundation, Philadelphia (http://slought.org) in conjunction with
Chain Arts, is pleased to announce the two-night premier of "SEVEN VEILS
(Poetry in Moving Media)," a multimedia dance-theater piece based on an
adaptation of "Salome" by Thalia Field (Point and Line, New Directions
2000). Innovative choral music composed by Philadelphia-based Alexander
DeVaron provides a complex and often humorous sonic atmosphere for Jamie
Jewett's quirky amalgam of release, butoh and contemporary indonesian dance
styles.

Slought Foundation, Philadelphia encourages new futures for contemporary
life through art and theory. "Dimensional Text" is an event series
collaboration between Chain Arts and Slought Foundation. The dimensional
text series is an investigation into the ways that language can be presented
off the page. It presents language work that steps away from the book, the
podium, the conventional reading or performance.

Biographies:

Thalia Field's collection, POINT AND LINE, was published in 2000 by New
Directions. Her second book, INCARNATE: STORY MATERIAL is forthcoming with
New Directions in 2004 and a multimedia novel, ULULU (SHRAPNEL SCENES), with
film stills by Bill Morrison, is forthcoming from Coffee House Press in
2005. Thalia's performance writing and essays have been published in Theater
magazine and she was a Senior Editor for several years at Conjunctions where
she guest-edited an issue (#28) devoted to experimental music-theater.
Thalia has taught at Bard College, Naropa University and currently teaches
in Brown's Creative Writing program. In 1998 she co-founded the Summer
Writing and Performance Project at Perseverance Theater in Juneau, AK.

Jamie Jewett holds a BA in Movement and Buddhist Studies from Naropa
University and an MFA in Dance and Technology from the Ohio State
University. His dance background includes intensive study of Butoh, and he
has performed at the Joyce Theatre as a company member of Popo and The Go Go
Boys, as well as works by Bebe Miller, David Rousseve and others. A
certified teacher of the Shambhala Dharma Arts, Jewetts work is deeply
influenced by Eastern philosophy of composition. In 2000, Jewett was awarded
a grant from USINDO (the US Indonesian Foundation) to apprentice with
Suprapto Suryodarmo, a contemporary Indonesian Master of dance, ritual
performance and installation art. Through this relationship, Jewett has
taught and performed at a variety of festivals in Java, Bali, New York and
Boulder. Jewett's intermedia dance, "Snowblind", was commissioned by
University of Michigan's IMMEDIA festival in 2002 and his dance-film,
"Auslander", was selected as part of Lincoln Center's Danc!
 e on Camera festival and the Wexner Center's Ohio Film and Video Festival.

Alexander deVaron holds degrees from Connecticut Wesleyan University and
Indiana University, where his teachers included Alvin Lucier, Richard
Winslow, Eugene Brien, and David Dzubay. His works have been performed In
Canada, Europe and throughout the United States. He is the 2003 winner of
the Network For New Music Poetry Project competition, and his music has been
featured by such ensembles as the Tufts New Music Ensemble, the Seattle New
Music Ensemble and the New England Conservatory Cammerata. Over the last
twenty years, Mr. deVaron has combined his study of music with the study of
Buddhism and meditation. Over the course of these years, he has worked
closely with the composer Peter Lieberson to explore the meeting place of
these two traditions. Currently he is pursuing a doctoral degree at Temple
University, where he studies with Maurice Wright and Richard Brodhead.

Sorry, Joe, that it has taken me so long to respond.  We're limited to a
double dose per day by the list.  End of semester push also has put me
behind.  Anyway, I found your post pretty interesting and agree with your
take on Spicer.  I'm also with you that many poets--likely most of them
before modernism, and many during and since--presume an outside to language.
The key word here, of course, is "presume."  Actually I wouldn't argue that
such an outside exists, i.e., that Being transcends man's knowledge.  I would
argue that it doesn't exist for us, for man, outside of language.  I've
always thought of Keats' "Ode to A Nightingale" as forward looking.  Aside
from the influence of his inebriated state, Keat's fleeting epiphany is
ultimately created and contained by the poem itself, by language.  Thanks for
the give and take.  Best, Bill

Great post, Kirby.  Olson intrigues me also.  I do mean that the subject is
never self-identical, that as soon as we know it, know of it, it dresses like
an object.  And that slippage is a crucial aspect of the subject's definition
without which there would be no subject.  Focusing on the subject, we see an
object.  Focusing on the object, we see the subject.  This is because these
concepts are interdependent, relying on each other for their cogency.  And I
am not describing here a simple binary.  Each concept "contains" the other.
The binary does not operate "between" two things, but "within" each thing
where the relational field involves all signs, not merely two.  This, by the
way, was one crucial "discovery" that shifted us from structuralism to
poststructuralism.

As for Einstein, he hasn't been wiped out by a long shot.  However, recent
claims within the scientific community that the speed of light is not
constant haven't done him any good.  Best, Bill

Hi folks.



Doing a favor for David Amram, who is trying to get information to Ted's
companion.



From David's email:



"Can you find out how I could get in touch with Ted's companion to send
my love and do anything I can for his memory. Ted is the one who called
me in 1969 and left a message on my machine
that Jack had died.
  We were old friends from the begining of it all.
  I have great video of him and I performing a long improvised rap duet
together at NYU  in 1994, which his estate should have a copy of."

If anyone has address, phone, etc., please backchannel, and I'll send it
along to David.

Thanks.

Nick,

Make up your own reader.  Anthologies are never sufficient, especially for
the students you describe.  If you pick your favorite poems, your passion for
them will propel your teaching.  Close reading of twenty poems all semester
from different eras and cultures is better than perusing a whole book.

Best, Gloria Frym

Nick -- Gather your faves, representing varied poetries. Ask students to =
bring in copies of their favorites & explain why they care about those =
poems. Have each student keep a 3-ring binder and build your teachable =
text out of poems and by poets you have an interest in and that you care =
about. With anthologies you have to explain away why you choose to not =
use so many of the inclusions, while with your own every poem gets put =
into play. Try to include visual poems, work in translation, spatial =
poetries, sound poetry and performance pieces. Use tapes, CD's or other =
audio-visual formats. With older, state university students I find =
clarity, mature themes [cancer, loss, occupations & labor, adult love, =
etc.] are especially valued examples. JL

Subject:      The Rumsfeld Tablet
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"; format=flowed

Last week, Cecilia Vicuna asked me to read from Armand Schwerner's *The
Tablets* (Orono, Maine: National Poetry Foundation, 1999) at an event she
was organizing at New York's Poets House on May 12 to protest, and lament,
the looting of the Baghdad museum, and other cultural sites. Schwerner's
Tablets is based on a scholar/translator's reconstruction of a set of
Sumero-Arkkadian clay tables from 4,000 years ago, as Schwerner frames the
poem, which is, nonetheless, entirely his own creation.

The event opened with a presentation by Marc Van De Mieroop, of Columbia
University, in which he speculated that the destruction of artifacts that
took place in Iraq last month was part of an American program to wipe out
the cultural past of Iraq. I presented an alternative, equally dark,
speculation: that the destruction might not be the result of a deliberate
American campaign to target Iraqi antiquities but rather a product of the
brutal indifference to culture, foreign and domestic, that has been the
hallmark of the current Executive Branch of the U.S. government.

The evening consisted largely of readings in translation of contemporary
Iraqui poets, almost all poets in exile. Schwerner, who was born in Belgium
in 1929 and came to the U.S. a decade later, is also a poet of exile, but
one who became an American poet; indeed, a native American poet, if you
believe, as I do, that exile is a native, indeed foundational, experience
for American poetry.

A few days after I received Cecilia's invitation, something odd occurred. A
received an email from a trusted confederate in the Washington, D.C. area,
that a new Tablet had been discovered in the subbasement level below the
residence of Paul Wolfowitz. Startling news. Although we can't yet be sure
of authenticity of the Tablet  and our verification team has not been given
enough time with the Tablet to verify it  preliminary evidence suggests
that this Tablet is the work of Donald Rumsfeld and that it was composed
between April 10 and 12. After reading Schwerner's "Tablet II", I gave the
first public reading of the "Rumsfeld Tablet":

I loved the Rakosi poem, but don't think there is any way out of theory except to
learn it and then try to deal with all the problems.

In graduate school I was plagued by this problem of the subject (it has no
attributes, and therefore it doesn't exist, the logic went).  I had a lot of good
theory profs many of them French at the U. of Washington at the time.  Now most
of them have fled for more monied pastures.  At any rate, they confused me a lot.

During this time I happened to go to the Seattle Center and see the Dalai Lama.
I don't know if he could be said to have philosophical standing.  That is, he is
not a trained philosopher, but in the questions I asked him if he read French
philosophy (he was living in France at the time) and whether he knew about the
problems of the subject, about whether or not there was a real world, or whether
the world was only language, and to my amazement, he said he liked to read
contemporary French philosophy, and he laughed.

I can't repeat verbatim what he said, but he said that in Buddhism many of the
issues of contemporary French philosophy were wiped off the board 500 years ago,
and he said that in order to have a community worth living in you need to have
four (un-provable) axioms.

1.  The individual subject exists.

2.  The real world exists.

3.  There is causality between the individual subject and the real world.

4.  Every living thing suffers.

He said that unless a community agreed on these four postulates it's not going to
be a community worth living in.

He said that those four things are like axioms in geometry, postulates.  That is,
they are givens.  And as such, they are fictional, and you can't go below them
and give reasons for their existence.  It is the implications that come out of
them that matter.

I've thought about this in the decade since he said that stuff and more and more
think he's just plain right.  I'm no Buddhist, but those folks (or at least he)
have nailed some things.

I'm not sure if these four things make sense to others, and why he claims they
are necessary axioms in a community, but the main thing is that I think they
emphasize that real people are in a community together, and they are all
suffering all of the time.  The implication of this is that we have to have a
sense of compassion and responsibility.  Without that, no sense of community.  So
he actually posited a fictional subject for the purposes of begetting a real
community.  It seems to me the French are too dependent on logic in spite of
their claiming all power to the imagination.  A good part of the foundations of
philosophy is fictional, like the axioms in geometry and can't be logically
founded.

I'm going in circles.  The Dalai Lama managed to get me situated, but I don't
think you can really quote him in a poetics discussion as having the standing of
say Foucault or Derrida, can you?  Can you quote the Dalai Lama?  The question of
who has standing is curious.  Somehow if you look at the life as fruit of the
philosophy I think the DL is better than MF or GD, but again I think this could
maybe be put down as ad hominem.  I'm amused by MF and GD, but DL is a thing of
wonder -- although what happened to his country should be added to the list of
20th century atrocities.  Somehow we can't really prove whether experience is
made of language or has some kind of substance behind, some experiencing subject,
but the implications that come out of the axiomatic postulates nevertheless have
real consequences.

I liked your post and the philo/religious questions it raises. I think I am
right, however, in wanting to suggest caution on the above expression
(perhaps used as a typical Americano way of saying we are not affiliated or
compromised by devotion or membership in an hierarchical or whatever org?).

My knowledge of Buddhism - still small - is that it is a practice (a process
of mindfulness or paying attention - interior & exterior). No one ever is "a
Buddhist." There is nothing static about it.

Distinctions I hear when someone says, 'I am a poet' as different from "I
write poetry.' Or as a "poet" who just came back from a month of giving
University readings tells me, "I can finally get back to writing; the
simulation of being a poet is over, thank God."

on another list reg Ulmer has this to day about Katherine Hayle's new
_Writing Machines_: "The key is a balance
among legible reference, form adding its own level of meaning, and
reflexivity, evoking the very inscription technologies that normally remain
invisible." and I think the same thoughts is in Charles Baldwin's recent
review of Loss' _E-Poetics.

  I do think the poem just like the body can interpose itself between the
binary poles reflexively in much the same fashion.  In any event something
happens there even if the word reflexive doesn't capture it.

Just because many poets who have thought themselves attuned to what is
"outside language" have channeled that which is outside according to through
channeling, drugs, psychotic vision, or whatever doesn't eliminate this
outside or mean that it is not measurable - my current hypothesis is that it
is in fact the immune system but then I tend to buy into the wonders of
medicine these days.

POG

presents

poets Mark Salerno and Keith Wilson
Saturday, May 24, 7pm

MOCA
(Museum of Contemporary Art)
191 E. Toole Ave. (NW corner of Toole 6th Ave, downtown)

Admission: $5; Students $3

Mark Salerno was born in New York in 1956. He lives in Hollywood, where he
edits Arshile: A Magazine of the Arts. His books of poetry include Hate (96
Tears Press, Los Angeles 1995) and Method (The Figures, Great Barrington, MA
2002). The poet C.D. Wright says of the poetry in Method:

"If these pieces / glimpses / points in review could be molded into popular
songs (happily they resist) I'd buy every cd. Method is a spoken nightscape,
a starry, commiserating agent between Bronk and Creeley, a dry-eyed
testimonial of ambivalent standing between our incurable existential
awareness and bottomless communal longing. Salerno puts a clearheaded list
of key words in circulation and returns to us a plenary of mostly
single-sentence poems, a calvacade of impeccably broken lines, not
forgetting the invisible crack in everything. What little caviling goes on
is directed at the poet acaviling. He is, in all modesty and honesty, "just
doing his job"insuring that what we really think, and what we actually say,
is a tight fit."


Keith Wilson, professor emeritus and former New Mexico State University
poet-in-residence, was born on the Llano Estacado. He grew up in Fort
Sumner, Deming, Carlsbad, Alamogordo, Portland, Ore., and Albuquerque. He
graduated from the U.S. Naval Academy and the University of New  Mexico. He
is the author of more than twenty-five books of poetry including Midwatch,
When Dancing Feet Shatter the Earth, Stone Roses, Lions Gate, Graves
Registry, and Homestead. Wilson has received a Lifetime Achievement Award
from the Border Book Festival, a National Endowment of the Arts Creative
Writing Fellowship, a D.H. Lawrence Creative Fellowship, a Senior
Fulbright-Hayes Fellowship, a P.E.N. America Writing Grant, the New Mexico
Governors Award for Excellence and Achievement in Literature, and New
Mexico State Universitys Westhafer Award.  His most recent book,
Transcendental Studies, published by Tucsons Chax Press, will be available
to the public for the first time at this reading.  Robert Creeley writes of
this book

"This dear book is fact of a long practised care and the wisdom which at
last lets it go. Here are poems as intimate as breathing, recognitions quick
as a lizards moving in the sudden sun. Back of it all is the abiding love
for those ones lived a life with. May this circle forever be unbroken."

POG events are sponsored in part by grants from the Tucson/Pima Arts
Council, the Arizona Commission on the Arts, and the National Endowment for
the Arts.

BOB PERELMAN AND FRANCIE SHAW
Bob Perelman and Francie Shaw lived in the Bay Area from 1976 to 1990.
There, Shaw had a one-woman installation show at 80 Langton Street and
collaborated extensively with poets. She took part in collaborative
performances with Perelman and musician Larry Ochs; created book covers for
numerous poets, including Robert Grenier, David Bromige and Lyn Hejinian;
designed costumes for the Margaret Jenkins Dance Troupe and sets for Poets
Theater. She taught art at the Sierra School from 1984 until 1990. That year
she and Perelman moved to Philadelphia, where she taught art at Friends
Select School until 1997. Since then she has shown her work in Philadelphia
and New York (A.I.R. Gallery).

Perelman, a central figure in the group that has become known as the
Language Poets, has edited Hills magazine, organized and curated the Talks
Series, organized performances of the Zukofskys' "A"-24, and participated in
various art ventures, including 80 Langton Street (now Langton Arts) and
Poets Theater. He now teaches at the University of Pennsylvania. He is the
author of 16 books of poetry, including Ten to One and The Future of Memory;
and 2 critical books, The Trouble with Genius and The Marginalization of
Poetry. He has edited two collections of poets' talks, Hills Talks and
Writing/Talks. Playing Bodies, Perelman and Shaw's painting/poem
collaboration, is forthcoming from Granary Books later this year.  Tonight
they will be presenting Playing Bodies alongside an update of their
1976 collaboration, 11 Romantic Positions.

Stephen,

I was jokingly referring to that political canard where some contender says,
"You're no John F. Kennedy," or "You're no Martin Luther King," so I guess you
could say I knew about the grammar being a bit off, but I like your point.
Identities are fluid underneath any kind of name.  But then I guess this again
has some sort of bearing on the discussion that I'm still not sure I understand.

Does Bill believe that there is nothing outside of language, or only that
language is the limits of what we know at any given time.  For instance, before
the discovery of viruses, people still died from viral contagion.  They just
said to themselves, "Well, I have sinned, so I deserve this."  But in fact it
was a virus they got -- maybe from drinking out of the same communion cup with
somebody who was dying from plague.

I'm willing to go to the limit of saying that language posits limits to what we
know, but that outside of language there are gadzillion things that we don't
know.  I think for instance there are something like a billion different kinds
of beetles (I heard the number once and it was astronomical) and many of them
have yet to be catalogued.  Would Bill argue that they have no real existence
because they haven't yet been catalogued, or only that we are unaware of their
existence?

When I am talking about something outside of language, I am just saying we are
pretty abysmally ignorant.  If Bill agrees with that, then we may be more or
less on the same page.  And I agree that any kind of identity that we have is
provisional and shifting.  This is part of what I find troubling in orthodox
Marxism.  For instance, somebody will say, this person is bourgeois, and this
person is a prole, but tomorrow the fortunes of the bourgeois person could crash
and they could end up getting a job at a McDonald's, while the other could win
the lottery, or find oil on their property, like the Beverly Hillbillies.  At
that point, I suppose their class shifts, and hence their identity, but I've
never really know what identity is supposed to be in Marxism.  Maybe some
neo-Marxists have developed a more fluid notion of class.  Is Joe Strummer of
the Clash a member of the proletariat simply because he has the accent, and acts
like he is from an underclass family although he isn't really?  All this
performance of class that you get a lot is fascinating to me on both sides --
the young woman in the Shaw play who learns a new accent to become upwardly
mobile, or the downwardly mobile people like the Clash that I've read actually
went to the best public schools in England and never lacked anything.

I think the Dalai Lama is positing a kind of soul in his argument that the
subject exists.  It is not a static thing, but rather an active one, but one
that is held accountable in a matrix of responsibility called a community.  It
shifts, but for all practical porpoises, it doesn't.

I guess it's people dying.

A chilling moment in my class room after the market in
Baghdad was bombed by the US Army: three or four
students (a heartbreaking number) really and truly
expressed that they just didn't care. "The price of
war" and all that.

Earlier today I was hearing kind of a public safety
announcement on the radio about this new seatbelt
campaign: saying 82 people die every day from traffic
accidents because they weren't wearing seatbelts.

And of course that made me think about the pure
*constancy* of death at every moment, every second,
all around the world in all the different places
people dying, lots of times awfully, lots of times
simply.

Last month when the duct tape and plastic scare was
happening (was it only last month? that can't be
right: two months ago) I remember sitting in a
classroom, looking out the window over the Hudson
river at the Catskill foothills thinking how strange
it was to be alive when suddenly *anything* could
happen.

And all I could feel, in that end-of-winter-moment was
a quiet prayer  to Whatever Made It, "I am so grateful
to have been alive in this world"

and a feeling of surrender to whatever happened next.
I guess it was an actualization of the second line of
this yogic incantation we always do in yoga class:
"Lead us from the fear of death to knowledge of
immortality."

i realize this has religious underpinnings that might
not be shared by everyone.

But I was thinking this also when Agha Shahid Ali
died. That in all these mystic tradition from St
Teresa to Rumi to Lalla to Hindu mystics there is this
idea of a final transcendant union with the Divine.

In Islam a prayer is uttered whenever one hears of a
death. The rough translation is "From Allah we came,
to Allah we return."

While I never knew what Shahid Ali's religious beliefs
were we at least shared a Muslim upbringing. I liked
to think of him as being born of poetry and then
return to poetry: meaning "prana": meaning That-Which
holds all the molecules together.

What I mean is: the molecules that have converged to
form the planet have only come together
temporarily--they'll make something else when the
planet (inevitably) flies apart.

Poets are not dying; only fulfilling their physical
promise. We will all do this also.

BRAIN HAS A WAY OF DISTORTING MEMORIES

By Carey Goldberg, Globe Staff, 5/13/2003

Bad news for diary enthusiasts and raconteurs: Accumulating evidence
suggests that when it comes to preserving memories, certain things are
better left unsaid. For example, researchers found that when subjects
watched a videotape of a mock bank robbery, those who were asked to describe
the robber in detail just afterward had a harder time identifying him later
than those who had never tried to put their memories into words.

Another experiment found a similar effect with wine-tasting: Sometimes,
describing a wine's flavor made it harder for certain people to pick out the
wine from among others when they were taste-tested later.

Psychologists call this phenomenon ''verbal overshadowing,'' and they have
been studying it for the last dozen years, intrigued by yet another
indication that, though memories may seem as static as snapshots, they are
in fact fluid and vulnerable to distortion.

Psychology professor Jonathan Schooler of the University of Pittsburgh, who
discovered the effect, defines verbal overshadowing as ''situations in which
one tries to describe difficult-to-describe perceptions, thoughts or
feelings, and as a result of that, loses access to the very information
they're trying to describe.''

Ironic, isn't it? You take the trouble to try to record your most ineffable
moments, and just by trying to put them into words, you distort the very
memory you're trying to preserve.

As another prominent researcher, Christian A. Meissner, a psychology
professor at Florida International University, puts it: Verbal overshadowing
''shows that the way you articulate your experience can alter the way you
remember it in the future.''

In fact, work on verbal overshadowing calls into question what for many is
the greatest joy of writing a diary -- the opportunity to chew over various
life events, more exhaustively than even the dearest of friends could
stomach.

Several overshadowing experiments, Schooler said, found that when people
ruminate over feelings, it can interfere with accurately assessing them.
Subjects did much better when they just went with their gut, he said.

But for diehard intellectualizers, there are some heartening aspects to
verbal overshadowing.

For one thing, the wine-tasting experiment found that people who were expert
not only at tasting wine but at describing it lost nothing by putting the
taste into words.

So keeping a diary or retelling experiences could cause no harm for people
who have plenty of practice at it.

Also, verbal overshadowing does not tend to affect memories of things that
lend themselves easily to words anyway, like simple descriptions of actions
or chains of events.

And, in general, Schooler said, ''There's tons of research in memory that
suggests that recording experiences and rehearsal will help you to remember
certain aspects of that experience.''

But just keep in mind that it's a double-edged sword, he said: ''Certain
kinds of distortion may also occur, and they may be particularly pronounced
when you try to explain why you're having the experiences you are and when
you try to describe really ineffable experiences.''

Diaries aside, work on verbal overshadowing has clear implications for law
enforcement and the handling of witnesses. In particular, Meissner said,
''Our research says that if you're going to ask a witness to make a
subsequent identification, maybe it's best not to push them when it comes to
their description of the perpetrator.''

Schooler and Meissner disagree over the underlying mechanism at work in
verbal overshadowing. Meissner sees it as a ''recording problem,'' that
people distort memories as they lay them down or when they retrieve them.
Schooler sees verbal overshadowing more as a sign of conflict between the
parts of the brain used in verbalizing and the parts used for nonverbal
perception of things like faces or maps.

But both seem to agree on the overall lesson. As Meissner put it: ''We need
to be careful about the way we express our memories, because the manner in
which we express something may distort it in the longer term.''

Dear David,

great to hear from you.

I replied to the wrong e-mail. Was at a union meeting last night and found a
stick of chalk in my pocket so wrote 'Joans Lives' on a wall.

You know I'd never disbelieve your mother. Your book must be a hummer if its
better than usual. Wow!

Will bc re address.

best

Randolph

INTRODUCTORY ESSAY
By Harry Polkihorn

"600 WRITERS?"

Let us carefully examine the following statement: There aren't 600
writers worth publishing. If not 600 then how many? 500? 1,000? What if
there were only one writer whose work was worth publishing? Better yet,
what if no writer's work was worth publishing? To complete the picture,
what if all writers' works were worth publishing? Those would be the two
poles of this particular spectrum, none and all. Does the exact, or even
approximate, number matter, if regarded from within the context of a
discourse on aesthetics? No matter how you view it, at some point
considerations of value can no longer be left tacit but must be brought
out into the light of day. Until the Internet develops to its end point,
an editor will always be faced with choices.

How is "worth" to be established? Just to go along with the pragmatic
spirit of our culture, I'm proposing that we start, but not end, with
the quantitative. I believe there are about 260,000,000 people in the
United States of America today. In my imagination I see thousands dying
and thousands more being born each day. Of these 260,000,000 perhaps as
many as half cannot write for one reason or another. Some are too young,
others stricken with illnesses, and so on. We are left with 130,000,000
writers. How many of these 130,000,000 writers' works would be worth
publishing at a given time? Let's discard 99% as being beneath our
notice. That leaves 1%, or 13,000,000. To be conservative, we could
discard a full 99.9% of the 130,000,000, which would leave 130,000
writers whose works are worth publishing. Let's discard another 30,000
just to be safe, leaving 100,000, which becomes a kind of quantitative
horizon of the publishable in the U.S.A. in 2003. Quite a large pool of
writers! In fact, it' s a rushing river of writing, most of which, as we
know, goes definitively and forever unpublished. Thus, without
attempting any form of traditional evaluation of "quality," we can see
very clearly that the chance is quite high that almost all writing of
worth never sees the light of day, a strange state of affairs on the
face of it. (cont)

>
> Ironic, isn't it? You take the trouble to try to record your most

>

>>

You're not going in circles.  Permit me this long quote - I broached a
similar topic on another list and will simply repeat myself here:

"Once, when Allen Ginsberg was in Colorado to do a one-month meditation
retreat, he told his lama, Trungpa Rinpoche, that he was going to bring
little notepads that he would keep by his meditation cushion so he could
write down the beautiful haiku that would flash into his mind after many
hours of meditation.  The lama said, 'Can I see your pads and pens?'
When Ginsberg displayed the tools of his literary trade, the lama
snatched them away, saying that the reason to go into retreat and
meditate is to *stop* collecting and holding on to all those transient
thought bubbles.  He exhorted Ginsberg to be aware of the ongoing
process of transparent awareness itself, rather than getting caught up
in collecting the flotsam and jetsam of the mind and continuously
rearranging its contents in the display cases of artistic ambition.

Ginsberg loved to tell this story because he was still - like all of us
- so attached to displaying beautiful thought bubbles.  The more we
meditate, the more good ideas we seem to get, don't we?  We can't wait
to get back home and tell somebody, write about them, paint them, bottle
them, and market them.  Samsara cologne, nirvana books and tapes,
enlightenment records, greeting cards, and calendars.  Guru Beer! (Yes,
there is such a brand, made in India.)

Nirvana, the end of all our troubles, the extinction of this fire of
craving, is just on the other side of each moment of craving, of hanging
on.  That's where the great 'letting go' comes in and must take place.
Then ultimate peace is right there; total fulfillment, wholeness, the
end of all craving, luminous and profound; simple not complicated;
unfathomable, bottomless, yet inexhaustibly rich.  Not like those little
thought bubbles we are always trying to collect so that at least we have
something to show for ourselves - a whole pile of little thought bubbles
on a pad, big deal!  Is that all we have at the sunset of our lives, a
big, frothy pile of foam?

Of course we love poetry, and we love everything that is sparkling,
original, and fresh.  Still, all that is pale compared to simply
experiencing the absolutely startling, poetic freshness of the present
moment without having to write down, collect, preserve, or fabricate
*anything*.  Then every moment bespeaks truth." - _Awakening the Buddha
Within_, Lama Surya Das

I'd been reading in this book again and bookmarked this passage because
it rung so true for me.  I confess to being in love with "thought
bubbles"; I confess to doubting them;  I confess to the gift of lucid
dreaming, which has given me many beautiful "thought bubbles."  I am
both afraid and thankful that I am on the threshold of fully realizing
fully what Lama Surya Das says is beyond the writing down, collecting,
preserving (*that* is an illusion) or fabricating.  But, to be honest, I
don't know if I'll get there.

I was shocked to hear that Ted had died; I always thought he had discovered=
,
and squirreled away somewhere, the fountain of youth-- and some day would
let us in on the secret.

One Bastille day some years back I was reading this poem with a few student=
s
in the small park at the tip of the Ile Saint-Louis in Paris (incidentally,
the park where Julio Cortazar set his story "Blow Up," later adapted by
Antonioni and De Palma):


=B3Crowds=B2

It is not given to everyone to take a bath in the multitude; to enjoy the
crowd is an art; and only that man can gorge himself with vitality, at the
expense of the human race, whom, in his cradle, a fairy has inspired with
love of disguise and of the mask, with hatred of the home and a passion for
voyaging. =A0

Multitude, solitude: terms that, to the active and fruitful poet, are
synonymous and interchangeable.=A0 A man who cannot people his solitude is no
less incapable of being alone in a busy crowd.=A0 =A0

The poet enjoys the incomparable privilege that he can, at will, be either
himself or another.=A0 Like those wandering spirits that seek a body, he
enters, when he likes, into the person of any man. For him alone all is
vacant; and if certain spaces seem to be closed to him, it is that, to his
eyes, they are not worth the trouble of being visited. =A0

The solitary and pensive pedestrian derives a singular exhilaration from
this universal communion.=A0 That man who can easily wed the crowd knows a
feverish enjoyment which will be eternally denied to the egoist, shut up
like a trunk, and to the lazy man, imprisoned like a mollusc. The poet
adopts as his own all the professions, all the joys and all the miseries
with which circumstance confronts him. =A0

What men call love is very meagre, very restricted and very feeble, compare=
d
to this ineffable orgy, to this holy prostitution of the soul that abandons
itself entirely, poetry and charity included, to the unexpected arrival, to
the passing stranger.=A0

It is good occasionally to bring home to the happy people of this world,
were it only in order to humiliate for a moment their inane pride, that
there is a happiness superior to theirs, vaster and more refined.=A0=A0The
founders of colonies, the pastors of peoples, missionary priests exiled to
the ends of the earth, doubtless know something of this mysterious
drunkenness; and, in the heart of the vast family which their genius has
created for itself, they must laugh sometimes at those who pity them their
destiny that is so unquiet and for their life that is so chaste.



We had concluded reading and were asking ourselves what Baudelaire could
possibly have meant, with this enigmatic figure, "the poet"-- when lo,
appeared just across the park, whispering to a girl in a green coat a fourt=
h
his age, in a dandy scarf . . . Ted Joans!

I called to him and Ted graciously came over to talk to my students-- thoug=
h
we couldn't get a poem out of him ("no bread, no Ted"). He did, however, le=
t
us in on the source of Max Ernst's title for his great work, "Hundred
Headless Woman"-- which came from Ernst's affair with Peggy Guggenheim . . =
.
not that Guggenheim was "hundred headless," but that she lived on rue de la
Femme Sans T=EAte (the statue that lost its head in the revolution still
stands, missing her head, in a third-floor alcove at the corner) about two
blocks from where we were sitting. It's also the street where Baudelaire's
African mistress Jeanne Duval lived. What goes round comes round.

In any case, Baudelaire's words seemed to have conjured the very poet befor=
e
our eyes. Ted had a way of showing up like that (last I'd seen him previous
to this incident was reading his poems in George Whitman's musty little
library with flowers and Notre Dame ringing out the open window). You can
see pictures of him jamming with Kerouac, Ginsberg, Jones/Baraka, Di Prima
and co. in many an old album zutique of Beatnik glory. Ah, legends. "If you
ever see a man walking down the street talking to himself . . . do not fear=
,
it is only the poet. You have nothing to fear from the poet . . . but the
truth."

That "truth" could be little righteous in Ted's case ("it's one thing to si=
t
up in your garret and write your little poems," he once told us around a
pichet of bohemian red, "it's another thing to *be* a poet!"), but I suppos=
e
he connected times and places in ways few of us will ever get to.

HAPPY VISIONS, TED. TRAVEL SAFE.

It's a strange business.

The poem I always think of is Allen Ginsberg's Death News.

"Walking at night on asphalt campus
road by the German Instructor with Glasses
W.C. Williams is dead he said in accent
under the trees in Benares; I stopped and asked
Williams is dead? Enthusiastic and wide-eyed
under the Big Dipper..."

It is as if the Big Dipper is poised to scoop us up at any moment. An old
New Yorker cartoon: a man is climbing a mountain and a giant fly swatter is
positioned ready to end his little life.

I heard Allen speak Death News, and only read it years later. That mournful,
sincere voice floating from the radio. I was in midst of packing, preparing
to leave for Japan, ready to let go a piece of my familiar self. I think we
die piece by piece. Patchen suggested this, in his deathly painful days.
Unlike "falling to pieces," one day the last piece one's self floats away.

Friday memorial for Kirby Doyle -- Beat writer, poet

A memorial poetry reading will be held Friday for Kirby Doyle, a Beat
era poet and writer whose lyrical, evocative verses and brutal, bleakly
humorous prose made him a mainstay of the North Beach literary scene.

Mr. Doyle, 70, died April 5 at Laguna Honda Hospital in San Francisco
after a long illness.

"He was a handsome, big-smiled Irish American rascal," his longtime
friend and fellow poet Michael McClure recalled. "He was an original
Beat, loose- jointed, with a great laugh. His poetry was beautiful
stuff."

Mr. Doyle was a native of San Francisco, a U.S. Army veteran and a self-
admitted poor student.

"I failed every subject it was possible to fail in high school, and got
kicked off the football team for smoking," he once said.

In the 1950s he was a culinary school student and an art major at San
Francisco State University when he began dashing off poetry for the
college literary magazine and several small reviews. In the late 1950s,
he wrote a highly acclaimed set of 36 brief love poems published under
the title "Sapphobones."

"Words like mad exotic birds fluttering/from my thorax/whipping my
speech --

moist and gaudy feathers/gone from my lips upward -- " he wrote.

His friend, the writer and editor Neeli Cherkovski, called Mr. Doyle's
verse "poetry without boundaries that -- in clear, concise, musical
language --

expressed something timeless about the human condition."

Ten years later, Mr. Doyle wrote his first novel, "Happiness Bastard,"
on a long single roll of paper fed into a manual typewriter, in the same
fashion that his contemporary, Jack Kerouac, wrote his famous "On the
Road."

"Happiness Bastard" was a dark, humorous story of a love affair, loosely
based on Mr. Doyle's own struggle with drugs and broken hearts.

In the 1960s and 1970s, Mr. Doyle abandoned writing for long periods,
living alone on Mount Tamalpais and battling drug and alcohol
addictions. In later years, Mr. Doyle worked on an epic poem titled "Pre
American Ode" and a novella titled "White Flesh."


The poetry reading will be held at 7 p.m. Friday at the New College of
California cultural center, 766 Valencia St., San Francisco.

Hi all,

Just a note to let you know that poems 1-10 and 11-20 of the series "My Angie
Dickinson" are now up at http://www.mainstreampoetry.com .  Wedged in between
is an illuminating interview with Robert Pinsky.  I claim the "Dickinson" poems
as my own but I cannot claim to have had any part in the Pinsky interview, much
as I'd like to.

It seems like everything is being printed from and/or on a computer
nowadays. Immateriality is conquering the world. Nonetheless, I would still
like to do a few things the old way via the physical impression of words
onto the page, and I am wondering if this is still a viable option. Maybe a
publisher can tell me.

I want to take a text that I have formatted in Quark Xpress and print it out
using some kind of a digitally interfaced typesetting machine. What I would
like to end up with is for the words to be lightly embossed on the paper as
they are in standard (pre-computer) printing methods. I also am hoping I can
get a variety of different levels of black for the lettering, as is easily
possible in a program like Quark where you can set the shading from 0 to
100%.

So, is there a single printing process that can make this happen? Ideas
and/or links to info would be much appreciated.

Why not just handset the type to begin with?

Ordinarily I'd agree, but this is a "special" interview.  -m.

Call Steve Woodal or Katy Barr at the Center for the Book in San Francisco
(you can find their web site for phone number). Either one will be able to
point to somebody who has expertise in connecting bytes to polymer plates -
perhaps Eric Holub -  which will get the effect you want on texture (the
punch). (Tho "embossment" is the elevation of the letters created by
punching down everything on the page except the letters.) Shading the text
in varieties of blacks is harder to do letter-press (more runs and costly).

"Text" I believe has its origins in Greek and once literally met "to weave".
Which makes a nice intersection with the process of writing - weaving in out
of pixels - on the monitor screen. "Texture", however, in a felt or tactile
sense totally disappears the experience of reading and not touching the
smooth monitor. The absence of which drives many back to letter press and
metal type. (Tho I suspect there are biomorphic computers that you both hug
and get the look and feel the language at hand or "at body" so to speak.
Metal typesetting, paper making and book binding Classes at the Center for
the Book are often full and often full of monitor/key board groggy workers -
hungry for the touch of the real thing.

offset printing, which was the standard immediately pre-computer, and still
is the standard for most commercial printing, has no such "lightly
embossed" effect.

miekal is right, you want letterpress printing. you don't have to hand set
the type as he suggests, but that's one very good way. another is to have a
polymer plate made, but then you also have to print it or have someone
print it for you.

you might contact harold kyle at boxcar press --
<http://www.boxcarpress.com>. as for your "different levels of black," with
letterpress printing you can mix whatever color of grey you like, but you
need a different press run for each color. So you're talking about a
potentially very expensive printing job. of course, you can get the greys
by using half-tones, which can be made into metal or polymer plates, and
with different dot-screens for the half-tones, you can at least approximate
different shades of grey.

commercially, though, even having a small chapbook letterpress-printed, if
you hire someone to do it, can cost at least a few thousand dollars, and it
will cost more for multiple colors.

I'm glad this discussion is taking place here.  Harold Kyle does =
excellent work and has helped me get my own shop organized here in =
Buffalo.  Happily I've just finished printing my first book using =
polymer through-and-through this afternoon.  Although Charles is right =
to point out that the cost can be quite high if you're sending it out to =
a job printer, if you can learn to do it yourself it is actually cheaper =
than photocopies and a lot more fun.  The plates don't deteriorate, =
which means that you can bring the book back into print ten years from =
now, where monotype has to be consistently, and patiently redistributed. =
 As digital fonts continue to improve (the P22 Foundry =
http://www.p22.com/ is one example) the semblance to monotype is =
stunning.    =20

Unlike monotype, polymer combines the fluidity of digital design with a =
traditional letterpress aesthetic and in my opinion, radicalized the =
possibilities of the book.  Gerald Lange has written the most =
authoratatative book on the subject I am aware of, entitled Printing =
digital type on the hand-operated flatbed cylinder press.  Harold sells =
these through Boxcar Press.  If you're near a center for the book, there =
may be a way to learn the process yourself, as there is a deep =
satisfaction in working intimately with the materials.  Also, there is a =
useful directory of resources at =
http://members.aol.com/aapa96/lpress.html.

All Best,

Kyle

offset printing, which was the standard immediately pre-computer, and =
still
is the standard for most commercial printing, has no such "lightly
embossed" effect.

miekal is right, you want letterpress printing. you don't have to hand =
set
the type as he suggests, but that's one very good way. another is to =
have a
polymer plate made, but then you also have to print it or have someone
print it for you.

you might contact harold kyle at boxcar press --
<http://www.boxcarpress.com>. as for your "different levels of black," =
with
letterpress printing you can mix whatever color of grey you like, but =
you
need a different press run for each color. So you're talking about a
potentially very expensive printing job. of course, you can get the =
greys
by using half-tones, which can be made into metal or polymer plates, and
with different dot-screens for the half-tones, you can at least =
approximate
different shades of grey.

commercially, though, even having a small chapbook letterpress-printed, =
if
you hire someone to do it, can cost at least a few thousand dollars, and =
it
will cost more for multiple colors.

Thanks all of you for all the input! My own idea (never tested to see if it
would work) is that I create a series of copper photoetching plates from the
laser-printed pages, and then make the print run myself. That way I can
control the depth of the embossing and also get different shades on the
lettering without having to do multiple ink runs. I will look into this
polymer process, though.

The reasons for me not to do straight hand-typesetting are many. First
because I don't know how and don't really want to learn, and second because
the computer can do things with text that are way too difficult to do by
hand. Also, I want to combine a semi-homemade look with an ultramodern look
so that the two sides get to play off of each other, in the same way that
the materiality -- tactility? -- of the embossing process and the
immateriality of the computerized stage of the process are messed with and
brought into a not quite perfect, but hopefully still beautiful, marriage of
convenience. (Of course, I am planning to have the textual content itself be
partly a reference to all of this and thus achieve an integration of form,
content and medium.)

Dear New York poets:

I'm planning a reading trip to New York spanning Thursday, May 22nd to
Tuesday morning, May 27th. My original plan was to room with a more
monied relative, who will be in town on business at the same time,
expense account for hotel rooms in tow. Unfortunately, this person's
trip has been shortened at the last minute,  leaving me without a place
to stay the nights of Sunday the 25th and Monday the 26th.

Is there anyone in the area who would be willing to put me up for those
two nights? I really can't afford the hotel room for the extra two
nights on my own, though I can afford to buy whatever food I eat, would
be happy to cook for you, etc. I'm pretty quiet and unobtrusive as a
houseguest, no vile habits that I'm aware of (ok, I smoke, but I don't
do that inside even at home). If anyone can help me out with this minor
dilemma, I'd be most grateful.

Thanks,
Taylor Brady

Thank you for the thoughtful clarification Patrick.  Weiner's "Awareness =

substantial point of perpetual inquiry entitled "Journalism - notes on =
Hannah Weiner." =20

I should also mention that this issue is dedicated to Leslie Fiedler =
(1917-2003) and includes a special section on his life and work with =
contributions from Robert Creeley, Raymond Federman & Bill Sylvester.

Speaking About Myself in the Second Person


It is strangely like
moving a body surpassing
the need to live

almost trusting that not you
but another is right there with you
making sky seem the plane
where you are

because you reach it not caring
if you do     the thought
that it is there for you to reach
is enough

the way there    seems to you
very natural

as if you stumble over clouds and yourself
just so you possibly
can see

I don't think David Kennedy is on this list, but The Paper, his English mag
is out with an issue whose dynamic focus is ""Movement Motion Notation" -
with lots of nice stuff on the relationship of walking  (urban and rural)
and making works (poems, books, sculpture), as well as dance and
performance. Interview, essay, and poem contributions include Sean Bonney,
Karen MacCormack, Colin Simms, Stuart Mugridge, Elaine Randell, David
Kennedy, Lawrence Upton and yours truly.

While reading The Paper I was again taken, in a good interview with Stuart
Mugridge (walker, sculptor/ book maker and poet) by a Robert Smithson early
seventies quote, "Many parks and gardens are a recreation of the lost
paradise of Eden, and not the dialectical sites of the present. Parks and
gardens are pictorial in their origin - landscapes created with natural
materials rather than paint. Scenic ideals which surround our national parks
are carriers for a nostalgia for heavenly bliss and eternal calmness. Apart
from the ideal gardens of the past, and their modern counter parts -
national and urban parks, there are more infernal regions - slag heaps,
strip mines and polluted rivers."    That mind set definitely put a
different set of legs on the possibilities of walking directions, urban &
rural landscape views , concepts of the sublime and language making.
(Though when I say that I immediately think Smithson's view is already
presaged by Williams in Patterson - the eye to decay - and Reznikoff's
counter-sublime wanderings & Manhattan materials).     To divert further, it
will be interesting to visit DIA's new indoor mega-sculpture garden when it
opens in Beacon, New York and question whether the sculptural sites (Judd,
Serra, Heizer, DeMaria, Chamberlain, etc.) - within the former and enormous
nineteenth century Nabisco box printing factory - will be viewed and
consumed as a re-invention of an "orderly sublime" -  devoid of any material
inclusion or reference to  Smithson's slag heaps or "infernal regions."
Heah, poets, peripatetic, take all!

Very apt phrase, I think, especially in its psychiatric sense:

  Pronunciation   kEn faeb yE le shEn
   Definition 1. the act or an instance of chatting casually.
   Crossref. Syn.   chat
   Definition 2. in psychiatry, the substitution of fantasy for fact in the
memory.

noun:   (psychiatry) a plausible but imagined memory that fills in gaps in
what is remembered
noun:   an informal conversation
verb:   unconsciously replace fact with fantasy in one's memory (psychiatry)
verb:   have a conference in order to talk something over
verb:   chew the fat; shoot the breeze

I would tend to define it as to spin fables collaboratively which would
apply to most threads, lists, etc. on the internet so I don't know you were
referring to the thread, the list, or to my post?

confraternally yours

http://www.zzoz.com/theater.html

DOOR WIDE OPEN is a memory play. Through the intimate correspondence of
writers
Jack Kerouac and Joyce Johnson, we are swept back to the cultural foment of
the
late fifties. Joyce today, looking back, and Joyce then, living the letters=
,
are our guides. Through the frame of a wiser, more cynical woman confrontin=
g
her younger, more idealistic self, we see Kerouac in the defining moments o=
f
his career, skyrocketing to fame=85and crashing terrifyingly to earth.

Amy Wright (Noises Off, Mrs. Klein, The Accidental Tourist) is the Narrator=
.
Adira Amram, making her professional NYC stage debut, is young Joyce. And
John
Ventimiglia (The Sopranos), in an uncanny portrayal, is Jack Kerouac.

Bringing the era vividly to life is legendary composer and Kerouac
collaborator
David Amram, who will be performing his original, multi-instrumental score
live
at all performances through June 1st (afterwards, his score will be
presented
by musicians hand picked by Mr. Amram.)

Author Joyce Johnson is the author of the novels Come Join The Dance, Bad
Connections & In The Night Caf=E9, the award winning memoir Minor Characters,
and an acclaimed non-fiction account of the Steinberg murder case, What Lis=
a
Knew. A new memoir, Missing Men, will be released next spring.

Director Tony Torn is co-artistic director of Sanctuary Theater Workshop.
Recent directorial credits include Lee Ann Brown=92s song cycle The 13th
Sunday
in Ordinary Time, Chay Costello=92s Pandora=92s Box of Sweets, Juliana Francis=92
The
Baddest Natashas and Box, and J.M. Synge=92s In the Shadow of the Glen. As an
actor, he has worked extensively with directors Richard Foreman and Reza
Abdoh,
and recently played the title role in Shakespeare=92s Titus Andronicus at the
dietheater Kunstlerhaus in Vienna, Austria.

The play is produced by Emmy and Obie award winning actor/director Rip Torn=
,
for Sanctuary Theater Workshop. Hosting the production is Bob Holman=92s
Bowery
Poetry Club, an acclaimed new venue for poetry, theater and music in lower
Manhattan. For reservations and information call the Club at 212-614-0505,

just to put my two cents in....

I got the new issue yesterday and--once having finally settled down with
it--was up till about 2am...

It moves really well, the arrangement--and range--of work helped drawn me
in. Working my way through some of the poems which I might not have been
completely on board with was always rewarding as the next piece would
somehow twist what I'd just read...

Anyway, there are only 400 copies of this journal ( which you really gotta
respect...a poet at a recent conference talked a little about the value of
self-imposed scarcity...I like that..as a solution to the endless piles of
media...)

Oh and one of Rodrigo Toscano's poems in here works great if yr neighbor
playin' hip-hop kinda loud while yr tryin' to read on the back porch...I
mean it goes really well w/ the beats!

This wouldn't be practical for a long book, but for a
book with short texts, one can use a manual typewriter
and, if you want a good tactile quality, vellum paper
(the Clearprint and Bienfang brands work well). I used
this idea for WHITEWALL OF SOUND number 16 (1996)- I
wanted to do an issue that got away from the computer
and the photocopier. I came up with 8 different short
texts; each page had a single word typed on it. The
vellum pages were interleaved with pages cut from a
varity of sources (LIFE magazine, text books,
machinery catalogues, sheets of blueprints, etc.)
Overall, the idea worked well, as the text on the
vellum "floats" above and interacts with the texts and
images on the pages from the books and magazines.

all;
in the past i was looking for a handcarved look for text, and undertook to
handcarve in linoleum an entire age of text - the idea was eventiually
trimmed to consist of justthe last 5 lines of ulysses (in abt 1/2" tall
letters) carved into a single piece of lino and then printed from that
original plate. extremely labour intensive, but it looks good - i wouldnt
recommend it tho, as fixing any mistakes is pretty much impossible...

Maria:

Although I agree with Treece's views, I do think his way of expressing it is
inappropriate for a teacher who is trying to get his students to think for
themselves. I say this with regret, as ignorance of what's happening to this
country abounds, partly because our education system is failing to teach
children the responsibilities of living in a democracy. Civics is not about
saluting the flag, but questioning why it's being saluted. Good teachers
know this, and, like Treece, are frustrated because they are talking into
the prevailing wind, which supports the right-wing, and only flutters the
feathers of the left.

For Bill Austin and others,

I'm still interested in this language topic as it's something I've never really
considered, but want to take it in a Darwinian direction and see where it goes.
Life on the planet is about four billion years old.  It's only the last two
hundred thousand years that we've had homo sapiens.  Before that there's some
kind of missing link -- our closest ancestor I believe is the chimpanzee -- we
share 97% of the same DNA -- and the genetic split with the chimp was four and a
half million years ago.  I don't know what I'm saying yet so be patient as I
fumble my way in the dark.

In graduate school there was a great conference called the Social Bond, organized
by Mikkel Borch-Jacobsen.  Derrida was supposed to come, but he refused to be on
the same bill with Rene Girard, or at least that was the rumor.  Girard is
another heavy-weight in critical theory circles but he's very different -- he's
Catholic -- and his dad ran the Museum of the Popes in Avignon. He was a big
wheel at Stanford for decades.  Brilliant guy, with intelligent disciples.  Eric
Gans, one of these disciples, gave a talk about the origin of language in the
formation of the earliest social bond.

That is, what Gans said is that language began when a tribe of prehistoric people
were eating a mastodon.  When they realized there wasn't going to be enough to go
around, they began to whisper, and to form alliances.  This is where he
speculates that language began -- in a dark plot to sequester calories.

Gans, like his mentor Girard, assumes that there isn't enough to go around, and
that therefore an alliance is made, and those who are in on it scapegoat the
others, and say they are evil and greedy, and kill them, and then they get to eat
the rest of the mastodon in peace and plenty.

Raimonda Modiano, a brilliant Kantian Coleridge scholar from Romania, objected.
She said she felt the origin of language could just as easily have been founded
with an exchange of positive critiques.  In other words, one tribesman would turn
to the other and rub his stomach and say, "Mmmm.  Good."  Kind of like the
Critique of Judgment in Kant, or some kind of aesthetic origin to language.

The question then is WHY DOES LANGUAGE BEGIN?  Certainly there is a prehistory to
language, since as far as we know we are the only animals to use language.  Some
simians can be taught to use it, but it isn't natural to them.  Dolphins do a lot
of verbal chatter but nobody's sure if it's jibber jabber or not.  We use
language.  For what?

I'm aware that this poetics discussion board was put together by poets from the
LANGUAGE group, but I'm not sure what percentage of the people on the list remain
attached to that philosophy, or even how that thought has mutated from its early
days.  My impression is that this school was largely Marxist.  It seems to me
that a Marxist would see the beginning of language in what Deleuze called
"order-words."  In other words language is used by the more powerful to boss
around the less.  So they could say something like in the mastodon scenario, "Get
me nice piece of mastodon, slave."  And have it be carried out.  So there is a
kind of suspicion of language within LANGUAGE (I can't be bothered to put in the
equal signs).

Schopenhauerians, as an aside (this is beginning to be fun for me, as I see my
ideas falling into place even though I don't yet know where they are going),
posit that at the heart of humanity is a monstrous will that urges us to have sex
and kill (my students love this guy and think he's right) but that language is a
way to cover this up.  That is, we are all about sex and murder but forks,
knives, and polite dinner conversation are a way to cover this up.

Beats me what's so.  The first symbol that we have is the Wallendorf Venus, and
then the cave paintings at Lascaux -- only 30,000 years old.  We don't know what
they are about.  From a Darwinian perspective, it seems to me that Marxists have
a solid point about alliances of the powerful, and wanting to create a
counter-alliance of the weaker members to form unions.  This has only been worked
out in the last hundred years.  What remains to be seen is whether we can form
alliances without wars, without scapegoats, and whether language can have a
unifying function within aesthetics, or whether it is only a tool of power, used
for order-words.

I think Deleuze wants to break down order-words, commands, and this would be in
line with what I see LANGUAGE as doing (stop me if I'm way off here) by analyzing
and being suspicious of the imperialistic element in language.  This would assume
that language is almost always evil.

But yet I note in Bernstein's more recent poems at least a turn toward humor.

Humor implies friendship (there can be savage cruel humor, but the kind of humor
I see in his poetry is friendly and even aesthetic in character).

I would love to see the origin of language in humor.  Humor has its bizarre
implications of forming a community as well.

And it's something again that we don't see in animals except again maybe in the
playfulness of dolphins.  Well, certainly insects don't have humor.  Worms don't
have it.  I don't even think birds have it (although parrots can be funny, I
don't think they know they are being funny).  So maybe humor begins with the
afterdinner entertainment after the mastodon has been eaten with somebody
cracking the others up or something.  I don't know -- I would like to think that
somehow humor and beauty have a place in language, and are even at the origins of
it, but perhaps it's too optimistic.

Keats' nightingale is expressing rather sad emotions according to the poem.  So
perhaps at least we can say that animals do have emotional expression.  Darwin
said that they did.  And I think he does believe that they can communicate those
emotions.

Sorry for the long post.  Obviously language fits in with evolution, as it comes
only later in it, and it has allowed us to triumph as a species.  I wanted to
give a long view of it, and put it into a wider perspective, and ask what you
think is its origin.

There's a little more after I quote you.

-- I didn't quite understand what it looks forward to.  Is this a utopian
epiphany that you see in the poem, or is it religious? Keats mentions that the
bird was not born for death!  Does he think the bird is going to heaven?  I
wasn't sure if this is what you were talking about.  Also, Ruth is mentioned at
the end of the poem, giving it an almost gnostic context of all of humanity and
even animals stuck in the wrong place.  I found this weird as I reread it.  Birds
are genetically dinosaurs.  Keats didn't know that, and the Romantics keep using
them as symbols of soul.

Somehow I prefer humor over the complaint of the nightingale, and humanity to
dinosaurs.  I like all the religious groups that use humor -- the Buddhists, the
Sufis, and so on.  I liked the sixties radicals when they were funny -- not just
Lenny Bruce, but also Leary, and the funny poets are the ones I back which is why
I love Corso.  Even Charles Olson can be funny.  I'm hoping that's the direction
of evolution.  I can't bear zealotry or too much piety.

sigh i just can't resist adding my two cents in here. this is actually my
hometown where the cop conducted his 1:30 a.m. inspection. it's strange...i
live in southern china now, so i followed the whole thing on the local
newspaper's website.  i also know many of the people involved, and my mother
happens to be the editor of another paper in the area.

mr. weishaus- your post was very thoughtfully written but with all due
respect, you aren't really in a position to pass judgement on Mr. Treece's
teaching methodology based on this article. His posting of the "idiot boy
king" sign is actually a very insignificant aspect of this whole
bruhaha...his detractors are very blatantly calling for his head not because
of a stupid little sign, but because of his professed politics. And to be
sure , Mr. Treece has never shied away from expressing his own political
views, both in and outside of his class. But what his detractors can't see,
or won't see, is that, in the very best tradition of Confuscious, Mr. Treece
is a teacher by example- by passionately and intelligently articulating his
own political orientation, he challenges his students to do the same.

But of course, some students are not up to that kind of challenge, and some
people have complained that certain political viewpoints are stifled in his
class. But for every one of those complaints, there has been a current or
former student who has stepped forward and essentially made the point that I
just did.

Incidentally, their school budget was just defeated yesterday, for the
second time. A vocal group  threatened to defeat the budget as a protest
against Mr. Treece. It is difficult to say if they were able to make good on
that threat...these are tough economic times and voters across the country
are shooting down school budgets.

Also incidentally, this is the same town that made national headlines last
month because of the national guardswoman who made never-substantiated(to
this day) allegations that she was harrassed and had stones thrown at her by
local high school students.

we're a real hotbed of radicalism, or something.

Circulars is going into hibernation mode for the summer, possibly forever,
on May 31.

It will stay online as a resource of poetry, art, statements, opinions, wtfs
and news stories for future "archeologists of meaning."

New stories will still be posted from time to time, but the new homepage
will primarily be an index of the more than 450 items posted in the past 4
months.

Thanks to all of the contributors, commenters and readers.  There's still
enough bad news to go around, but the intensity of the dissent, at least
online, has slackened -- time to try something different.

-- I didn't quite understand what it looks forward to.  Is this a utopian
epiphany that you see in the poem, or is it religious? Keats mentions that the
bird was not born for death!  Does he think the bird is going to heaven?  I
wasn't sure if this is what you were talking about.  Also, Ruth is mentioned
at
the end of the poem, giving it an almost gnostic context of all of humanity
and

 >>

Kirby, enjoyed your post!  Sorry if my remark seemed vague.  I meant only
that the epiphany Keats refers to might be the experience of writing (or
completing?) the poem, that such intellectual/emotional highs, albeit
transitory, are brought into view through language.  After all, isn't it
Keats' poem that transfigures the bird, that assigns its transcendence.  So
Keats is forward looking (maybe) in that he assumes this experience within
language, and so dips into what language theory will later soak in.  Keats'
concept of negative capability also prefigures 20th century struggles with
the idea of indeterminacy.  Differences obtain, certainly.  But he's
nevertheless on track.

As for the origins of language, your guess is as good as mine.  Maybe each
person you mention has a piece of the action--maybe not.  Vico, I think,
offered sensation as the starting point.  Sounds good.  Or not.  The human
big brain is an obvious factor when it comes to cognition and development.
Wish I could do better than merely add my own speculation to that of others,
professional or otherwise.

One interesting tidbit from contemporary language theory is that origins, w
hatever they might have been, are displaced, lost, at the very moment they do
their thing, at the moment they are recognized.  We cannot know them as
transcending the structural field.  We can only know them as provisional
complexes which always break down into yet more structures.  Any identifiable
beginning immediately becomes an effect (an expression of multiple
structures) and exists within conceptualization, rather than outside or
beyond or before it.  In this sense, it is the impossibility of our
comprehending a self-identical origin which accounts for the concept.  Put
another way--and more generally--one depends on two for its identity as one.
Because there are two, we have the idea of the one, but in fact there is
never (for us) only the one.  And if two is coextensive with one, it doesn't
even make sense to claim that one comes before two.  Now what does that do to
the idea of origins?  Weird, right?

I'm not saying there aren't biological/psychological/etc. causes for things,
or pre-conditions, or something like that.  It's just that we can't know them
as biological/psychological anything until language creates such
designations.  We are always, it seems, at some remove from things as they
are, if they are.

I'm not at all surprised by the antagonism between Girard and Derrida.
Gerard's project was phenomenological.  Derrida's critique of Husserl must
have given him fits.  But I'm guessing here.  Best, Bill

Bill,

Your comment about "birds" is interesting. "Bird" is a central image of
Sufism, and my guess is that the person you are responding to 9from Delhi)
comes from that tradition. I also think "Ode to a Nightingale" is a supreme
poem, and it does possess a "forward motion," that of the bird through the
forest.

"Bird" may be a dead word for the soul in purely 20th century western terms,
but do you think the west is the future of the world or the soul exists in
only a western language? To me that sounds like a dead idea.

Best.

Murat

I think it's the proceedings of the Charles Olson Society, or some

>The question then is WHY DOES LANGUAGE BEGIN?

I think it's better posed as a "how" question than a "why" question. You'll
agree that language depends on the semiotic, i.e. that the possibility of
the meaningful utterance is predicated on the possibility of the sign. As
for what makes the sign possible, you find it in Aristotle (Prior
Analytics, 70a): "That which has something to do with another thing,
whether preceding it or following it or occurring at the same time, is a
sign [semeion] of that thing's being or having happened." In other words,
any datum by which we infer something about the world is a sign; what makes
it possible is the fact of its perceptibly "having to do with" what that
something. So it's a question of association -- an association that is
neither purely "natural" nor "conventional."

I don't know what kind of nut goes public with his or her theory on the
origin of language, but I think I'm about to. What led me to it is the
_Sahibi_ of Ibn Faris (d. 395/1004), where he explains the derivation for
the Arabic word meaning "meaning" [al-ma'ana], giving 2 explanations. The
first is that al-ma'ana is "the thing one wishes and the goal," the idea
being that the meaning of an utterance is located in its speaker's
intention. Simply put, it's what the speaker is trying to say. The second
explanation goes back to the verb from which al-ma'ana is formed: this is
'ana/ya'ni, defined by Ibn Faris as "making manifest" [al-izhar]. This verb
is used of the earth's sending forth vegetation, and of a wineskin which
does not hold liquid but sends it dribbling forth. You'll notice that
though these are not intentional acts, it still makes sense to call them
"expressions," in that something is being sent forth from something else. I
think the intentional (i.e. verbal) sense of al-ma'ana is patterned on the
second, unintentional sense, and that for the utterance to be understood as
a making manifest of emotional content, you need the prior concept of the
"expression." It may be that this concept predates vertebrate life, and I
don't think you need to go outside of Marxism to explain it. What was
Rodney's phrase? "The effort of the world trying to communicate with us."
Is this not the pattern for our efforts to communicate with one another?

If anyone wants to start a separate semiotics list, please let me join. I
worry that the subject may have become tiresome to many on this list. Not
to me though! LRSN

For Murat Nemet-Nejat,

There seems to be a confusion here.  I am from Delhi, New York, not Delhi
India.  The town is misnamed.  It is in the Catskill Mountains near Oneonta New
York and Woodstock NY.  The name is a joke perpetrated by a mapmaker in Albany
on the then mayor of this town who seems according to the guidebooks to have
acted "like a mahatma."  But it was a friendly joke at his expense, done in the
early 1800s.

I am also responsible for the image of the bird in Romanticism as the notion of
the soul, but also linked them to dinosaurs genetically.  there's a lot of ways
to look at birds -- as symbols, and then you could look at them through the
western scientific lense.

Sorry for the mix-up.  Bill's not responsible for that image -- the Romantics
are.  I wasn't really criticizing their idea of the soul, but just noting it,
and wondering if Bill was seeing hope through a Christian lense.  No, he was
seeing it through a poetic lense, he said.

I'm not a Sufi, but I like to read their stuff, especially the wonderful
Nasrudin stories.  They are funny stories.  I just read in French a funny book
by a Sufi psychiatrist named Moussa Nabati who was a student of Emmanuel
Levinas.  It's called L'Humour-Therapie -- where he explains the Nasrudin
stories from within a psychiatric perspective.  His explanations are a little
flat compared to the jokes themselves.

You are probably familiar with these stories.  Nasrudin is a kind of mischievous
Sufi priest.  The humor is a little like The Three Stooges except there is a
spiritual dimension.  Nasrudin's very important in the Gurdjieff tradition, and
I have been trying to do research on comic religious motifs so I've read through
Gurdjieff.  Gurdjieff cites Nasrudin more than anybody else.  I think they are
like folk humor, but have a spiritual side to them that you're supposed to
contemplate.  Here's one I'll quickly translate:

"A peasant accosted Nasrudine:
'I have a pain in my eye.  What do you think I should do?'
'The other day, I had a toothache.  I had it taken out, but do as you like.'"

(p. 46)

So that's what I meant by Sufi humor.  I am not terribly familiar with the
tradition, but find it really kind of fun.  I've never met an actual Sufi,
though.  I grew up Lutheran. Part of the reason I'm doing research on religious
humor is that I have suffered a lot from the lack of humor in the Lutheran
tradition.  Kant puts it down, Hegel barely deals with it, Kierkegaard is funny
when he isn't trembling, but it is not a major aspect of the Lutheran church.
Garrison Keillor is a Lutheran humorist but I don't find him very funny.  So
I've been researching other traditions.  Why should Jews and Sufis have the best
comic traditions?  If anybody knows other funny religious traditions I would be
interested to hear about them.   Lutherans tend toward a kind of piety that I
find a little stupid, frankly.  I especially hate this sentimental image of
Christ.  I would like him to have been a little funnier.  Some theologians claim
that he is but they twist the words very far to try and make them funny.
Anyway, the shrink's take on the joke above is that too often we ask others with
different experiences what we should do, when our experience is individual, and
we have to do what seems right to us, not asking any master but ourselves.  That
sounds right to me, but maybe there is more to it.  This book was my intro to
Nasrudine.

  OLSON was published by the Library of the University of Connecticutt
As I recall it was started, and finished (after about 10 issues, 1974-)
in order to publish material from the Olson archive deposited there after
his death. It's a source for Black Mountain material--syllabii, reading
lists, etc. drafts of various kinds. From recollection it is exclusively
concerned with Olson mss material, rather than interpretative criticism on

Yes, and on my last visit to the archive, the whole run was still =
available for a very reasonable price.  Rutherford is the one to get in =

This summer, use The Critics to help you select your beach reading. And don't forget to let us know what you think of the books, the reviews, the site, by taking advantage of the handy Letters to the Editor feature.

Here's some of what you'll find in this quite tardy installment 5 of the Constant Critic (http://www.constantcritic.com)

Jordan Davis on Loren Goodmans Famous Americans: Disclosure: Loren Goodmans time at Columbia coincided with mine. While I generally follow. Publishers Weeklys lead in preferring not to talk about first books of poems, and given that my eyebrows arch automatically when I see other critics praise their friends, I would feel remiss if I failed to alert the reading public to Goodmans work.

Christine Hume on John DAgatas The Next American Essay: The best anthologies are in the spirit of turning the tourist into a traveler; the worst pander to our tastes for the sentimental (grandmother and New Formalist poems) or sensational (victims and New (American) poems); they satisfy by way of consumerism.

Ray McDaniel on Ais Dread: I am very fond of her Cruelty (1973), I am pleased by the textures of her Killing Floor (1979), there are moments in which her Sin (1986) is compelling. Her Fate (1991), however, is a bit dim; her Greed (1993) gets the best of her, and her new and collected Vice (1999) is more or less what it claims to be. And now her Dread, the title of which nearly prohibits further comment.

RON CHARLES: Beyond Jayson Blair
Christian Science Monitor Service


The Christian Science Monitor
(May 15, 2003 5:24 p.m. EDT) - The scandal over fabricated stories by
New York Times reporter Jayson Blair continues to develop. Media
critics who called for the resignation of Mr. Blair's senior editors
were stunned to learn yesterday that the Times has no senior editors.

When reporters from several other New York papers went to the Times'
historic headquarters on 43rd Street, they discovered only a Starbucks
and a dry cleaner. Apparently, the legendary newspaper was merely an
elaborate hoax started by Alexander Rankoff, a Romanian prankster who
came to America in 1851.

Although the Times once claimed to have 1.2 million subscribers,
federal auditors have so far been able to locate only six, all
descendants of Mr. Rankoff.

A reporter with the New York Post said, "I don't understand how we
could have missed this. Sure, there have always been suspicions about
the Times, but everybody was always claiming to read it, so it seemed
like a real newspaper."

A senior editor with the Boston Globe, which was purchased by the New
York Times Co. in 1993, reportedly was "alarmed" by news that the Times
does not and, in fact, has never existed. "This is a major blow to the
homogeneity of the news business," he said, requesting his name not be
used. "Without the Times to tell us what to print, papers around the
country might panic. We could have an epidemic of editorial
independence on our hands."

New Yorkers are taking the latest revelation in stride. Indeed, many
said they weren't surprised. "A 38-page style section but no comics?"
scoffed one cab driver. "Come on!"

Leading intellectuals expressed regret at news of the Times'
nonexistence and quickly began removing references to the Times from
their resumes.

"This is another great loss to American culture," said Gore Vidal.
"Now, more than ever, people interested in ideas that matter will have
to rely on 'Lingua Franca.'" (Calls to Mr. Gore's home to confirm his
comments were not returned, leading to speculation that he does not
exist.)

A statement from The Pulitzer Prize Board, which confessed to having
awarded 89 prizes to the Times, said the foundation was considering a
number of changes to guard against fraudulent or nonexistent entries in
the future. "It's now clear," the statement said, "that we should open
all the submission envelopes before awarding Pulitzer Prizes."

At a press conference earlier this week, a White House spokesman
sounded vindicated: "This administration has always behaved as though
the press doesn't exist, and now the American people are starting to
see the wisdom of that approach. When they need to know something
important, we'll tell them ourselves."

Is this, too, a prank?
While I have seen the CSM and their reading rooms (although these don't seem
as prevalent as they used to), perhaps it's "all" an elaborate hoax.
Consider all of the historic events that some people think were
fabricated...

Hi Jane. I'm at Emily's now and I don't have your
message about the posters and I can't remember what you
said. You thought about dropping them off? It's too
late for that, I suppose. But I'll check my e-mail in
the morning--if there's another way you can get them to
me tomorrow, let me know.

Subject:      neurology and the origin of language
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

There is an interesting article re neurology and synaesthesia in the May
2003 issue of Scientific American that makes some points re the possible
connection of metaphoric thinking and cross-wiring in the brain.
Specifically re the origin of language, the article, by Vilayanur S.
Ramachandran and Edward M. Hubbard, states:

    "Our studies of the neurobiological basis of synesthesia suggest
that a facility for metaphor--for seeing deep links between
superficially dissimilar and unrelated things--provided a key seed for
the eventual emergence of language. . . Assume our ancentral hominids
communicated mainly through emotional grunts, groans, howls and shrieks,
which are known to be produced by the right hemisphere and an area in
the frontal lobes concerned with emotion.  Later the hominids developed
a rudimentary gestural system that became gradually more elaborate . . .
If such gestures were translated through synkinesia into movements of
the mouth and face muscles, and if emotional guttural utterances were
channeled through these mouth and tongue movements, the result could
have been the first spoken words. How would we import syntax, the rules
for using words and phrases in language, into this scheme?  We believe
that the evolution of tool use by hominids may have played an important
role.  For example, the tool-building sequence--first shape the hammer's
head, then attach it to a handle, then chop the meat--resembles the
embedding of clauses within larger sentences.  Following the lead of
psychologist Patricia Greenfield of the University of California at Los
Angeles, we propose that frontal brain areas that evolved for
subassembly in tool use may later have been co-opted for a complete
novel function--joining words into phrases and sentences."

    I think that their point that the evolution of specific activities
(such as tool making) could have influenced language syntax is

the best book on jewish humor is freud's jokes and their relation to
the unconscious.  basically he wanted to write a book celebrating
jewish jokes --by which is meant jokes within the jewish culture, not
anti-semitic jokes about jews (sometimes people misunderstand this
distinction) --and this is what became of it.

News: Civil & Human Rights
Tempers flare as US attacks gas sellers in Baghdad
by Majid Jarrar and Salaam Al-Jubouri, Al-Muajaha
14 May 2003
Modified: 01:20:57 PM
Newspaper Web Special
http://www.almuajaha.com

BAGHDAD (14 MAY 2003) ? Hamed Mehson Alaiwi never expected
to be attacked by the American military. Alaiwi, a former
government employee, re-sells gasoline on the street in
order to support his family in post-war Iraq. Until today,
his new job seemed harmless. Daily, he fills his large,
gallon-sized gas cans at the Abu Qlam gas station and goes
in search of thirsty cars. Street sales of gasoline have
exploded in Baghdad since the war ended and gas shortages
began.

Gas stations throughout Baghdad have been ordered by the
US to stop selling gas to re-sellers and only let people
fill their cars, in order to cut down on crowding. When a
group of Iraqis carrying gas cans, including Alaiwi,
approached Abu Qlam at 1:30pm today, US soldiers stationed
there without a translator told the group in English that
they couldn't fill their cans. When the Iraqis continued
to approach the station, either not understanding or
ignoring the order, the soldiers shouted at them to stop,
and the Iraqis ran away. The soldiers pursued the group,
and pistol-whipped Alaiwi when they caught him, leaving
two, prominent welts on his forehead. The soldiers then
destroyed the gas cans with their knives.

Alaiwi was confused and angry after the beating. I never
attached them, they suddenly attacked me. They beat me
with their guns, and threatened me with a knife. When they
came, they were supposed to give us our freedom, not
assault us. He [the soldier] insulted me. If he was an
Iraqi, I would kill him. But he is an American, and I
can?t do anything, Alaiwi said.

Ahmed, an eyewitness to the attack, commented, The fight
today was nothing. A few days ago, an old man quarreled
with the Americans and they kicked him in the head. Every
day such situations happen.

Smith, one of the US soldiers stationed at Abu Qlam, said,
People were standing in line waiting to buy gasoline, and
these guys came with their gallon cans in order to get
gasoline to sell in the street. We told them not to do
that. They ignored us, and when we ordered him to stop,
they ran away. Smith continued, People who run from us are
bad people.

Hoopra, one of the soldiers who allegedly participated in
the beating, said, What guys? and turned away when asked
about the attack.

Rundown cars, filled with hot, sweating people, line the
street in front of Abu Qlam gas station, in Baghdad's
Karrada district. Gasoline is only available at this
station between 9am and 3pm daily. Before the war,
gasoline was cheaper than water in Iraq. Today, people
speculate that the US is purposefully causing the
shortages in order to teach Iraqis a lesson in the true
value of their resources.

Ghassan Al-Zubaidi, a high school student working at the
gas station, complained after the beating, The Americans
came for the freedom? That's all lies. They came, occupied
us, and stole our oil. They wanted this [bad situation]
for our country. They robbed, and they looted, and they
burned all the Ministries, except the Ministry of Oil,
which wasn't touched, because they wanted the oil. George
Bush is a son-of-a-bitch.

Murat, good to hear from you.  Of course I don't think that western ideas,
particularly those that are faith based, do or will or should dominate
everywhere.  That would be silly.  I'm not even sure that "bird" is a dead
word for soul in western discourse.  On the other hand, I once used the word
in a poem wherein the joke involved just that deadness, so who knows?  I do
think that semiotic verities apply across the board, i.e., that all languages
are subsets of LANGUAGE, are fields of relations, of interdependent
"elements."  What may appear to us as individual or--at the top of the
heap--self-identical, isn't.  Though the appearance rates as one of tricky
language's master achievements (the self, as just one example)  Best, Bill

i just wanted to follow up on my post about the police officer in Vermont
who went into a classroom in the middle of the night.
i didn't mean to come off as high-handed in my last post- the point i wanted
to make is one i think the many teachers on this list will understand
perfectly:

when it comes right down to it, as a teacher, what is the alternative to
teaching your convictions?   i strongly suspect there isn't an alternative.
the liberal high school teacher's detractors have said things like "he needs
to be teaching straight history, just the facts."
coming right on the heels of assertions that the teacher was "disrespectful"
to the president....well, i think it becomes pretty clear what their idea of
"straight history" and "the facts" is.

I concur.  And we "all" know that history has been, is, and will continue to
be manipulated to suit the needs--and purpose--of the history scribes...

With a few exceptions, of course...

Well, this is tricky.  I'm a teacher, I don't like what the cop did, and I
think the "idiot boy king" comment is funny and telling.  But *as* a
teacher, I wouldn't have introduced that comment into the classroom (or
the bulletin board).  For two reasons: the first is that I agree with the
administrator who said a comment that strongly worded makes it difficult
for students to disagree with the teacher; the second is that I'm usually
trying to get my students to articulate actual arguments, to do something
more articulate than simple name-calling.  Imagine yourself on the other
side of that "argument" (i mean the teacher's comment) and see how hard it
is to have a discussion.

Hello all:
I was wondering if anyone could refer me to poetry/prose that takes on
advertising, commericials, etc. in either form or content (or both).
Thank you!

I taught in the jails for many years.  Your situation is much more ideal,
because you don't, unfortunately for your students, have a high turnover.  As
for poetry to bring in, personally, I started with international poets who'd
been incarcerated and moved in and out of that.  With some notable
exceptions, I found that the incarcerated would rather read poetry that
doesn't deal with directly  with incarceration.
       There is one tremendous book of poems recently out by a French
Moroccan poet, Abdulaatif Laabi (City Lights Books), called The World's
Embrace.   It's bilingual.  This poet was imprisoned for 8 years simply for
writing poetry.  It is one of the most beautiful books of poetry dealing with
war and love and nationalisms I've ever encountered.  He writes with a simple
vocabularly, very accessible like Williams, yet very deep.
       If you want to weigh your reading with women, I can give you a lengthy
list of women writing in something like the poem in prose.  Some contemporary
and some older.  Please back channel.

My Best,

Gloria Frym

Depends on what you mean by "takes on" -- there's a poem by Ginsberg titled
"Personals Ad," which really is a personals ad. There's a song by Neil
Young, I think it's on Sleeps with Angels, titled "Piece of Crap," in which
a part of the chorus goes something like

         saw it on the tube
         bought it on the phone
         when I got it home it was
         a piece of crap

that I've always rather liked. There are certainly moments in Olson's
Maximus where he takes on the everywhere-present advertising that kills
everything else.

Barbara Cole's Situation Comedies is one of my recent favorites. It is =

Strange Weather Lately

By Kurt Vonnegut | 5.9.03

The following is adapted from a Clemens Lecture presented in April
for the Mark Twain House in Hartford, Connecticut.

--------------

First things first: I want it clearly understood that this mustache
I'm wearing is my father's mustache. I should have brought his
photograph. My big brother Bernie, now dead, a physical chemist who
discovered that silver iodide can sometimes make it snow or rain, he
wore it, too.

Speaking of weather: Mark Twain said some readers complained that
there wasn't enough weather in his stories. So he wrote some weather,
which they could insert wherever they thought it would help some.

Mark Twain was said to have shed a tear of gratitude and
incredulousness when honored for his writing by Oxford University in
England. And I should shed a tear, surely, having been asked at the
age of 80, and because of what I myself have written, to speak under
the auspices of the sacred Mark Twain House here in Hartford.

What other American landmark is as sacred to me as the Mark Twain
House? The Lincoln Memorial in Washington, D.C. Mark Twain and
Abraham Lincoln were country boys from Middle America, and both of
them made the American people laugh at themselves and appreciate
really important, really moral jokes.

I note that construction has stopped of a Mark Twain Museum here in
Hartford - behind the carriage house of the Mark Twain House at 351
Farmington Avenue.

Work persons have been sent home from that site because American
"conservatives," as they call themselves, on Wall Street and at the
head of so many of our corporations, have stolen a major fraction of
our private savings, have ruined investors and employees by means of
fraud and outright piracy.

Shock and awe.

And now, having installed themselves as our federal government, or
taken control of it from outside, they have squandered our public
treasury and then some. They have created a public debt of such
appalling magnitude that our descendants, for whom we had such high
hopes, will come into this world as poor as church mice.

Shock and awe.

What are the conservatives doing with all the money and power that
used to belong to all of us? They are telling us to be absolutely
terrified, and to run around in circles like chickens with their
heads cut off. But they will save us. They are making us take off our
shoes at airports. Can anybody here think of a more hilarious
practical joke than that one?

Smile, America. You're on Candid Camera.

And they have turned loose a myriad of our high-tech weapons, each
one costing more than a hundred high schools, on a Third World
country, in order to shock and awe human beings like us, like Adam
and Eve, between the Tigris and Euphrates Rivers.

The other day I asked former Yankees pitcher Jim Bouton what he
thought of our great victory over Iraq, and he said, "Mohammed Ali
versus Mr. Rogers."

What are conservatives? They are people who will move heaven and
earth, if they have to, who will ruin a company or a country or a
planet, to prove to us and to themselves that they are superior to
everybody else, except for their pals. They take good care of their
pals, keep them out of jail-and so on.

Conservatives are crazy as bedbugs. They are bullies.

Shock and awe.

Class war? You bet.

They have proved their superiority to admirers of Abraham Lincoln and
Mark Twain and Jesus of Nazareth, with an able assist from
television, making inconsequential our protests against their war.

What has happened to us? We have suffered a technological calamity.
Television is now our form of government.

On what grounds did we protest their war? I could name many, but I
need name only one, which is common sense.

Be that as it may, construction of the Mark Twain Museum will sooner
or later be resumed. And I, the son and grandson of Indiana
architects, seize this opportunity to suggest a feature which I hope
will be included in the completed structure, words to be chiseled
into the capstone over the main entrance.

Here is what I think would be fun to put up there, and Mark Twain
loved fun more than anything. I have tinkered with something famous
he said, which is: "Be good and you will be lonesome." That is from
Following the Equator. OK?

So envision what a majestic front entrance the Mark Twain Museum will
have someday. And imagine that these words have been chiseled into
the noble capstone and painted gold:

Be good and you will be lonesome most places, but not here, not here.

One of the most humiliated and heartbroken pieces Twain ever wrote
was about the slaughter of 600 Moro men, women and children by our
soldiers during our liberation of the people of the Philippines after
the Spanish-American War. Our brave commander was Leonard Wood, who
now has a fort named after him. Fort Leonard Wood.

What did Abraham Lincoln have to say about such American imperialist
wars? Those are wars which, on one noble pretext or another, actually
aim to increase the natural resources and pools of tame labor
available to the richest Americans who have the best political
connections.

And it is almost always a mistake to mention Abraham Lincoln in a
speech about something or somebody else. He always steals the show. I
am about to quote him.

Lincoln was only a Congressman when he said in 1848 what I am about
to echo. He was heartbroken and humiliated by our war on Mexico,
which had never attacked us.

We were making California our own, and a lot of other people and
properties, and doing it as though butchering Mexican soldiers who
were only defending their homeland against invaders wasn't murder.

What other stuff besides California? Well, Texas, New Mexico, Utah,
Nevada, Arizona, and parts of Colorado and Wyoming.

The person congressman Lincoln had in mind when he said what he said
was James Polk, our president at the time. Abraham Lincoln said of
Polk, his president, our armed forces' commander-in-chief: "Trusting
to escape scrutiny by fixing the public gaze upon the exceeding
brightness of military glory, that attractive rainbow that rises in
showers of blood -that serpent's eye, that charms to destroy, he
plunged into war."

Holy smokes! I almost said, "Holy shit!" And I thought I was a writer!

Do you know we actually captured Mexico City during the Mexican War?
Why isn't that a national holiday? And why isn't the face of James
Polk up on Mount Rushmore, along with Ronald Reagan's?

What made Mexico so evil back in the 1840s, well before our Civil
War, is that slavery was illegal there. Remember the Alamo?

My great-grandfather's name was Clemens Vonnegut. Small world, small
world. This piquant coincidence is not a fabrication. Clemens
Vonnegut called himself a "freethinker," an antique word for
humanist. He was a hardware merchant in Indianapolis.

So, 120 years ago, say, there was one man who was both Clemens and
Vonnegut. I would have liked being such a person a lot. I only wish I
could have been such a person tonight.

I claim no blood relationship with Samuel Clemens of Hannibal,
Missouri. "Clemens," as a first name, is, I believe, like the name
"Clementine," derived from the adjective "clement." To be clement is
to be lenient and compassionate, or, in the case of weather,
perfectly heavenly.

So there's weather again.

I am sure I am not alone on this list for having tried having a day job in
the "naming" or "branding" industry and/or writing ads. Even in the poetry
business it's an inevitable part of running any Publishing House, small or
large, coming up with a tag line and/or photograph to promote the poet.
Sales are about aiming the advert arrow  at the heart, brain & wallet.
Depending on "the product" it can feel either totally scuzzy or totally
alright, true to its origins, etc. etc.

One of once more famous incidents of a poet's hand on the ad making side is
Lew Welch's oft repeated sixties & seventies TV Ad Mantra:

Raid Kills Bugs Dead

No, Lew did not stay in that business.

Essentially _Minutes of the Charles Olson Society_ is the continuation
of _Olson: The Journal of the Charles Olson Archives_ and can be had by
sending Ralph Maud a nominal sum:

Ralph Maud
1104 Maple St.
Vancouver, BC, Canada
V6J 3R6


Some of you will know Maud's work from _Charles Olson's Reading: A
Biography_ (Southern Illinois UP, 1996). A biography of a bibliography!

I agree with you, Steven.

Being that our country has its face up its butt right now, I can appreciate
how difficult it would be not to inject one's own views into the classroom.
It takes discipline not to. But this, I suggest, is part of a teacher's job
description. The classroom is where children are suppossed to learn not how
to think as their teacher thinks, or their parents, their church, the
media...but how to think for themselves.

First name that pops up for me is Kenneth Fearing. Here's
the second section of "Aphrodite Metropolis":

II.

"Myrtle loves Harry"--It is sometimes hard to remember a
        thing like that,
Hard to think about it, and no one knows what to do with it
        when he has it,
So write it out on a billboard that stands under the yellow
        light of an "L" platform among popcorn wrappers and
        crushed cigars,
A poster that says "Mama I Love Crispy Wafers So."
Leave it on a placard where somebody else gave a blonde
        lady a pencil moustache, and another perplexed citizen
        deposited:
"Jesus Saves. Jesus Saves."
One can lay this bundle down there with the others,
And never lose it, or forget it, or want it.
"Myrtle loves Harry."
They live somewhere.

Thank you for your suggestions.   I should clarify that by "take on," I
didn't necessarily mean poetry that was "anti" advertising/capitalism in
some simplistic way.   Rather, I was much more interested in finding pieces
that incorporated and investigated the complicated formal and recursive
terrain of advertising.  "Take on" is a broad term-- perhaps not the most
appropriate, but certainly not one that assumes a strictly (or boring)
adversarial stance.

In relation to David Buuck's attempt to problematize this subject, I
recently read an essay by Paul Twitchell called "In Praise of Consumerism."
(It was reprinted in the book I use for my comp class called *Seeing &
Writing 2* -- about which I'd appreciate some back-channel comments if
anyone knows it).

Anyway, he starts off with a 1923 statement about advertising by one Helen
Landon Cass, which reads, in part

"Sell them their dreams. Sell them what they longed for and hoped for and
almost despaired of having. Sell them hats by splashing sunlight across
them. Sell them dreams -- dreams of country clubs and proms and visions of
what might happen if only. After all, people don't buy things to have
things. They buy things to work for them. They buy hope . . ."

And he says this can be read in one of two ways, by a melancholy Marxist who
sees it a barely veiled indictment of capitalism, or by an unrepentant
capitalist who knows consumers demand meaning. "Snake oil to the cynic is
often holy water to the eager."

But here are the two paragraphs that really got to me, which I quote in
full:

"I think that much of our current refusal to consider the liberating role of
consumption is the result of who has been doing the describing. Since the
1960s, the primary 'readers' of the commercial 'text' have been the
well-tended and tenured members of the academy. For any number of reasons --
the most obvious being their low levels of disposable income (!), average
age, and gender, and the fact that these critics are selling a competing
product, high-cult (which is also coated with its own dream values) -- the
academy has casually passed off as 'hegemonic brainwashing' what seems to
me, at least, a self-evident truth about human nature: we like having
stuff."

Then come a few more paragraphs, and then this utterly damning graph:

"Needless to say, in such a system [the sexist materialist hegemonic
advertising system] the only safe place to be is tenured, underpaid,
self-defined as marginalized, teaching two days a week for nine months a
year, and writing really perceptive social criticism that your colleagues
can pretend to read. Or rather, you *would* be writing such articles if only
you could find the time."

OUCH!

Apologies for the two long posts today, but this . . .

"Circulars is going into hibernation mode for the summer, possibly
forever, on May 31."

. . . is one of the sadder stories of the year.

Brian's great service in making available an electronic forum of poetic
dissent against the war should be a benchmark for any future efforts to
democratize the web.

It's also, unfortunately, a sign that the so-called "political poetry" of
the last few months was nothing of the kind, but more of a knee-jerk
reaction to the invasion of Iraq -- an event that few of more than
cheerleader mentality can welcome, but also a dead end as a "subject" for
any poetry that would seek to last longer than a few moments.

And I say that while realizing that "the test of time" is a bogus criteria
for judging poems. But I mean, really -- what happens to all those "Poets
Against the War" now that the war's over? It must be time to start
monitoring our portfolios again while making fun of Robert Pinsky and
epateing le bourgeoise . . . oh, and of course, having high-level
discussions about whether the thing is really real or just made that way by
language, that's always a good one . . .

(I was wondering if anyone remembered the little anecdote, in Cage's
*Silence*, about Suzuki Roshi being asked, after a three-day conference on
the nature of reality with other esteemed academics and religious leaders,
whether the table he was sitting at was real. And he said "Of course it's
real!")

(Oh, and that story about Jayson Blair from the *Christian Science Monitor*?
Totally true. And Swift really did mean to eat those babies.)

I don't really mean to sound misanthropic, but it's been a pretty wretched
century so far. Have you noticed?

Brian says . . . "There's still enough bad news to go around, but the
intensity of the dissent, at least online, has slackened -- time to try
something different."

It's true that the intensity of the dissent has slackened, but why? The
accommodation to the invasion is rather startling. The *Times* cautiously
asks where the weapons might be (but then, who listens to them? They lie.)
The Democratic "electable" wing of the party says any candidate who's not
strong on defense -- anyone who thought the invasion was the wrong move (not
to mention illegal, immoral, venal, short-sighted and suicidal to any
lasting peace in the region) -- can't be elected. The media, of course,
falls in line. Let's not even talk about Fox News, soon to own even more
media outlets in your neighborhood . . .

Here's the familiar but reliable Noam Chomsky on this question (from an
interview with David Barsamian published in *Monthly Review*):

"DB: You've described the level of public protest and resistance to the Iraq
war as "unprecedented"; never before has there been so much opposition
before a war began. Where is that resistance going?

"NC: I don't know any way to predict human affairs. It will go the way
people decide it will go. There are many possibilities. It should intensify.
The tasks are now much greater and more serious than they were before. On
the other hand, it's harder. It's just psychologically easier to organize to
oppose a military attack than it is to oppose a long-standing program of
imperial ambition, of which this attack is one phase, and of which others
are going to come next. That takes more thought, more dedication, more
long-term engagement. It's the difference between deciding, okay, I'm in
this for the long haul and saying, okay, I'm going out to a demonstration
tomorrow and then back home. Those are choices, all of them. The same in the
civil rights movement, the women's movement, anything."

Despite my antipathy, these days, for all things Texas, I'm rooting for
Steve Nash, the Canadian point guard of the Dallas Mavericks, with his
eternal bad hair day and anti-imperial sentiments. I'm rooting for all of us
who have been sickened and disillusioned by the coup d'etat of the homicidal
bunch of maniacs currently running the American government. And I'm rooting
for "something different" -- for a poetry that continues to monitor and
respond to this low point in our history.

>The rationale for this event is to place the focus on what

>language.
>
>This event is offered as a venue for articulating the social implications

>your translation activity, and to speak to the impetuses for why you
>translate, what you do with linguistic obstacles, and what the larger

Subject:      writing which destabilises place
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

Hi  folks

I am currently writing a book for tertiary level students on  creative
writing strageies.  I have a chapter on place/city and want some really
good examples of pieces which destabilise the idea of a fixed place by
moving from place to place. I'm particularly interested in finding
experimental prose written in short sections, in which each section
revolves round a particualr location, but these locations are never welded
seamlessly together.

I know that a lot of the experimental writing we write and read does this
kind of thing in one way or another: obviously the disjunctiveness of most
language writing means that it intrinsically moves from one space to
another.  And I've written pieces like this myself! But i'd like to produce
more variety of example, and ones which seem to foreground this particular
issue.  I'm interested in texts which destabilise place and also text which
illustrate time-space compression.

Would be glad of your thoughts on this: and if any of you have written
anything yourselves which you feel fits the bill, let me know.

Hazel

my new life by inspiron 3800


i had winme replaced by redhat 7, which ran lean, in spite of lack of
sound support. i upgraded to redhat 8, which requires really at least 128
ram, and 128 was added to my 64, and now everything is smooth. terminals
and graphic environments flicker back and forth; who knows where we are on
this journey through life? as basho says, 'days and months are travellers
of eternity.'

Walkups by Lance Blomgren (Conundrum press, Montreal) is an experimental
novel / collection of short prose in which each short chapter takes
place in a different apartment in the city, as the unidentified
protagonist/ narrator/ pov moves from place to place. It was a big hit
in Montreal, interrogating as it does the supposed essence of that
particular place.

Check out the novel "Cunning" by Laura Moriarty
published by Spuyten Duyvil--it sounds *exactly* like
what you describe.

Subject:        writing which destabilises place
Hi  folks

I am currently writing a book for tertiary level students on  creative
writing strageies.  I have a chapter on place/city and want some really
good examples of pieces which destabilise the idea of a fixed place by
moving from place to place. I'm particularly interested in finding
experimental prose written in short sections, in which each section
revolves round a particualr location, but these locations are never =
welded
seamlessly together.

I know that a lot of the experimental writing we write and read does =
this
kind of thing in one way or another: obviously the disjunctiveness of =
most
language writing means that it intrinsically moves from one space to
another.  And I've written pieces like this myself! But i'd like to =
produce
more variety of example, and ones which seem to foreground this =
particular
issue.  I'm interested in texts which destabilise place and also text =
which
illustrate time-space compression.

Would be glad of your thoughts on this: and if any of you have written
anything yourselves which you feel fits the bill, let me know.

Hazel

(the bolozone is an anarchist/activist housing collective in St Louis
who bought a few properties from the city & was in the process of
remodellng them... mIEKAL)


eport from press conference
by imc 5:55pm Fri May 16 '03    article#9070

         here is what I observed at the Press Conference at 3:30

Law Advisor Justin Meehan (attorney at law, 2734 Lafayette, St. Louis,
MO 63104 phone (314) 772 9494 fax (314) 772 3604) invited the press to
his office to speak with people who'd witnessed today's events.

Don Fitz, organizer for the Greens and the Biodevastation Conference,
spoke about the raids. He said that they were an effort to deny people
their first amendment rights. He thought that the police arrested
people to prevent them from participating in the conference. The
housing violations were simply a pretext, and that they were planned
"days ago."

Chris McClarren was in the van that was pulled over this morning. Three
different groups interrogated each person in the van. The first were
uniformed police. The second were detectives with badges, but in plain
clothes. The third were plainclothes as well, without badges. They
would not identify themselves, even after Chris asked who they were.
This group videotapped each person holding their ID next to their face.
THey also searched the entire van.

When Chris tried to get the names and badge number from the police, but
they ripped their badges and name tags off as soon as she tried to get
the information. One person in the van was detained because she did not
have an ID with her. The driver of the car was arrested for seatbelt
violations and for having what the police are calling a "controlled
substance" in the car - Vitamin C pills.

Chris also thought that the police had a pre-determined list of people
that they were looking to arrest.

A St. Louis Post Dispatch photographer was also arrested.

An unnamed eye witness described the raid at the Bolozone, a co-housing
project on Illinois Street. He saw 6 vehicles arrive at the house
during breakfast. Several cop cars, an inspector's car, a large truck
(empty) and a board-up truck (carrying boards to board up the house)
arrived. The cops put zip-ties on everyone and arrested about 10-15
people. The inspector went through the house, which is undergoing rehab
to keep the house up to code, and looked for violations.

The police began to remove things from the house, including 16
bicycles, duffel bags, slilts, tools from the workshop, and puppets.
One cop took a beer bottle from the house and put a rag on the top, and
showed it to the other cops, saying he'd found it that way in the house
(implying that it was a maltov cocktail). Other cops were placing
candles into sponges and putting them in the house.

An eye witness from CAMP was also there. She described a similar scene.
The police brought inspectors to the building to look for violations.
Several people were arrested. The building was searched and a bunch of
stuff was taken. Police took papers, puppets and posters. Police also
took one person's computer. There is a police line surrounding the
building and no one is allowed to enter it.

The lawyer was trying to get everyone's names so he could bail people
out. The lawyer's phone number is 314 772 9494

Dear Hazel,

       I'd look at the writings of Deleuze and Guattari, then contact Pierre
Jouris at SUNY Albany for his work on "Nomadism."  The novels of Carol Maso
may offer some interesting strategies, especially Ava, which is a
hypnotizing, circular text-- it is set in a dying woman's mind.
       For very contemporary "prose" exploratory writing, I recommend the
works of the young writer Renee Gladman, although her writing rather more
deals with time.  But one cannot determine place in her narrative, which is
interesting.
       For time/space compression, I highly recommend the short pieces of
Lydia Davis and Grace Paley.  Their narratives are rather straightforward,
but an immense amount of time is often attenuated in a small amount of words.

Best, Gloria Frym

The Figure the Day Makes

                -M = Missing data
                * = Data may not provide a valid measure of conditions.

One slight room may gently mock another.
If the basin-wide percent of average value is flagged as potentially
invalid, care should be taken to evaluate if the value is representative
of conditions in the basin.

Snow water equivalent percent of average represents the snow water
equivalent found at selected motel sites in or near the basin
compared to the average value for those sites today.

The total precipitation percent of average represents the total precipitation
(beginning October 1st) found at selected motel sites in or near the basin
compared to the average value for those sites on this day.
Contact your state water supply staff for assistance.

Reference period for average conditions is 1961-90.
Provisional data, subject to revision.

+

Conditions = the water site conditions measured near the basin's
motels beginning in May.

Reference for average of wide validity compared to any staff
day when Truth knocks at your door.

When I heard her voice behind his door, I flagged the site
for further evaluation. Compared to the truth of God, -M

your words* were just heavy breathing.
I came out of my room, hoping, as always,

for the best.

+

Reference for average of invalid sentiments*
at selected sites proved hard to find. The god of cancer
rendered assistance.

Reading Canone Inverso brightened my day,
comparatively speaking, your voice
for selected conditions, wider than my choice of berths.

Equivalent water sites can be measured for
selected conditions, he purred.
(Value for t = average author?)

Or maybe I shouldn't cite their figures -M
for fear of misreading day conditions.

+

If trying the first door doesn't work, then try
the second, and, if that doesn't work, the third, etc.

Just don't expect the staff to come running to your assistance.
-One or two may try to reach out to you, but

well . . . other fish to fry, as you already know. Who can
speak for those without tongues? All I have is a voice.

Moshi Moshi

Hello Nikuko. We will make an agreement. Your presence will be in my echo.
You will be a reflection of my language, otherwise a disappearance. Is
this a political gesture? I'm not sure. It will be up to you to decide.
I'm fine. How are you? I'm here to see if you can live through me. I
recognize this sounds absurd, but who knows? Stranger things have
happened.
I didn't come naked and broken to you at all! I came in good will, just to
see if your erasure will effect anything. After all, people don't think
you're alive in the first place! Moshi moshi?
I thought you might speak Japanese, a language I don't know, but then this
standard telephone greeting, a pause or gap in the conversation.
Why should it bother me? Nothing bothers me at this point.
It doesn't, Nikuko - you're confusing, your mixing my words.
Yes, I did say that. You'll be erased forever except through this text.
Your words will be a dead whisper. Nothing will remain...
Yes, it is such a healthy way!
I have no desires for you at all, Nikuko, no matter what you do with your
panties. I don't even have desires for "panties" or any other seven-letter
word!
What don't you understand? I'm trying to draw you out of yourself...
Yes, moshi moshi! What do you think of it?
I'm not going through anything in my life! Hell, everything is good at the
moment! You're not helping very much with my project.
And I have no interest whatsoever in turning you on or fucking you! What's
got into you? Nikuko, whatever are you about?
The boys don't say anything about this. They're elsewhere. I'd ask you to
look around, but I don't think you have eyes....
There's no real reason to any of this. It might be just a pre-text to a
text, a pre-text to writing a text -
I'm not yearning or crying, Nikuko; I'm not programmed to do that -
I've been looking at that, or rather looking at the screen. Moshi moshi,
and nothing happens at all. No matter what I do, nothing happens. Even my
imagination is at a loss here. How absurd!
I'd love you like crazy if I had to pay! What do you have in mind?
What makes me believe that? That you keep coming on to me, as if all you
want to do is fuck. Nikuko, this is print, nothing more. And you're not
really saying anything at all.
It doesn't explain a single thing!
If there is some girl, it's not you!
Positive!
Moshi moshi?
Yes, and now you're going in circles, the dialog is closing in, closing
down, we're all near the stage of disembodied memory and loss.
Your frocks are irrelevant here, your politics are more important,
whatever is embedded within you.
I'm not afraid; there is no pain or perhaps too much pain to go around.
I don't think so.
I'm sure from my own experience and travels. I can hear the voice now, but
it's not your voice of course...
I didn't come any way, broken or naked or otherwise... I'll end, I'm
coming to an end now, and goodbye...
Goodbye

Please please don't ever leave me.

Yes, Chris, I was just thinking there was something "Lingua-centric" or
"writer-centric" about the way question was posed. And that the question can
be reversed to ask about the way place destabilizes writing.

Which I think is a constantly fresh question. I am thinking political now.
The way Baghdad as a place is now in combat with the prescriptive neo-con
"road map" language that a liberated Baghdad would immediately embrace. The
"democratic" prescription - in fact - is being totally destabilized by place
(in fact, it appears, through out the country). Whatever emerges as
"stable", the place will definitely reshape the language quite differently
than presribed (including the veiled subtexts beneath the "democratic" one)

In my experience the language usually emerges best through a contest between
space-time and whatever equipment (words) that I bring to it. (I guess
that's a good old fashioned dialectic).

I remember teaching in Nigeria and trying to describe Wordsworth's
"daffodil"  in a landscape without a real daffodil. As teacher I was
'destabilized' as were "the students." Somehow the poem was not destabilized
- it just got another angle of vision than it would get in a northern
climate- providing (perhaps) a post-colonial mystery instead of a Victorian
sentiment.   (This was before a virtual hook-up could Google in a picture of
a daffodil -  which puts a whole new layer of access on transactions between
place and language).

I've gone on too long, but I am glad you raised the question.

Tribute and Benefit for Stan Brakhage (1933-2003)

In tribute to one of the great pioneers of the avant-garde film and a
distinguished former faculty member of the School of the Art
Institute of Chicago, the Gene Siskel Film Center presents a group of
the final films of Stan Brakhage, who died of cancer on March 9. The
program includes: ASCENSION, 2002, 3 min.; MAX, 2002, 4 min.; THE
JESUS TRILOGY AND CODA, 2001, 20 min.; RESURRECTUS EST, 2002, 9 min.;
and PANELS FOR THE WALLS OF HEAVEN, 2002, 35 min. All Brakhage films
are 16mm, color, and silent. The program also includes a videotaped
interview with Brakhage, made a few weeks before his death, in which
he discusses these works (2002, Pip Chodorov, 24 min.). (BS)

Admission is $8, with no discounts. Passes and member blue tickets
will not be valid. All proceeds for the screening directly benefit
the family of Stan Brakhage. This program is made possible in part by
the sponsorship of the Chicago Review.

The illustrations are nice, is about all I can say. I hope FC doesn't emerge
as the designated authority on Brakhage's work, as he is a moron. We need
more people to write about Brakhage with knowledge and authority, to put
gnats like FC in their place.

On a semi-related topic I believe Ralph Maud is still
looking for a place to house his reconstructed version of
Olson's library. I know he also wants to set up an Olson
museum in Gloucester. If anyone is interested in either of
these projects please backchannel. AV

Hi All,
I'm going to live in  Mexico City this summer for all of July and August on a
writer's residency. I'm writing to ask for any suggestions and advice on how
to make the most of it. Also if anyone has any updates on fines levied on US
citizens who travel to Cuba from Mexico City.

Best,

great surprising event especially Kirby's daughter, Kelley, speaking of =
her view of Kirby as both icon and psychotic - Michael Mclure about =
Kirbys pad in 57 near Batman Gallery, everyone grabbed onto a different =
part of the elephant and so we saw Kirby in all his facets. I spoke of =
his interactions of his days with me at the Oracle and read from an =
article he wrote for the Oracle - In prose he wrote like he talked so it =
was very direct and he ended his article with a short very direct =
uncluttered chinese style poem;

Poem To A Mountain Girl

...and in your sleep I awake here,
have eaten an orange
have gone to the creek and bathed
listening to its thin and liquid speech
its joy to run so free and clean
Now, returning to this ragged tent
sanctuary to your sleep, your real sleep,
I wish for you waking
so that we together could take cool pause
at the hidden pond I found down stream
our bodies quick and chilled
by the water,
our bodies breathing - holding

Now, as pen point and shadow
touch this page
I look up almost stunned to
know that from your sleep you have loved me.
and from my awakening I have loved you back

For Bill Austin, Murat Nemet-Nejat, Steven Vincent, et al.

I can't help but want to continue this thread as I'm enjoying your posts.  You are
all more scientifically theoretical than I am.  I am just intuiting my way, but
through aesthetics, mainly, rather than through linguistics.

I have been slow to respond due to the end of the semester but now I have a chance
to drag this into deeper water.

I'm not sure if this has been discussed -- the aesthetics of 9/11.  It was
impressive.  The plane entering the building, the huge building falling.  It
participated in the aesthetics of the sublime.  In fact it was all about this
impressive, big God that we seem to share with the Islamic tradition, and then the
question is meant to arise: whose side is he on?

Bush's counterattack (he needed a bigger canvas than Afghanistan to make his case)
was actually called SHOCK and AWE.  This is a clear reference to the aesthetics of
the sublime set forth by Edmund Burke, and then clarified and intensified in the
Critique of Judgment by Immanuel Kant.

Kant says that big things like the sea, waterfalls, the stars at night remind us
that there is a God.  I'm not sure how much Islamic aesthetics accepts this idea.
It's a totally blank slate to me.  They are not permitted to have a pictorial
tradition, but it seemed to me that Bin Laden and Al Qaida have an intuitive
understanding of this tradition.  They like to work on big canvases and make
terrific tragedies.

I'm sort of disgusted by this because it lacks a sense of humor.  Kant himself
denies that the humorous is ever aesthetic.  He says that humor is based on a
disappointment of expectations, and on the incongruous.  It's just a page or two
in the Critique of Judgment.

I've been trying to rebuild the comic as an important aesthetic and political
criterion.  Just fumbling toward this idea intuitively that democracy requires
humor.  Kenneth Burke wrote that a cult of comedy was humanity's only hope for the
future.  We're not getting this from the extremists, who prefer the Shock and Awe
of the Aesthetics of the Sublime.

What I'm trying to think about is a scaled down aesthetic of the comic picturesque
-- difficult but amusing, the way that say, Seinfeld can be at its best for
instance when he's trying to decide whether soup by itself can be a meal.  This
doesn't seem to have come from the Old Testament, but from a quite different
tradition that is apparently developed as another kind of tradition within Judaism
the way that the Sufis developed a kind of humor inside the Islamic tradition.
Somehow I think that this tradition has to be developed but to do so requires
another view of God altogether.  A god of small moments, of the enjoyment of the
mist arising from a newly opened orange, etc.  Maybe even a clownish God.

It's something different going on in the brain.  The picturesque is not in the
limbic system but primarily in the neo-cortex -- you have to think about it.  The
sublime is something awesome that goes down into the most primitive aspects of the
brain.  You almost can't think about it.  It's shock and awe.

It's difficult to stay in the neo-cortex (the area where almost all higher
thinking is done according to MacLean) when you are also thinking about politics.
So what we have  is a tradition where Tennyson has seemed to be more important
than Edward Lear, for instance, because we tend to privilege that deeper area of
the brain.  But now I notice lots of poets turning towards comedy and a distrust
of the great maneuvers of tragedy with its aesthetics of retaliation from Creon in
Antigone, and Clytemnestra on Agamemnon, up through MacBeth, etc. Tate, Lux,
Gudding, and many other poets turning towards humor.

A lot of writers like Gregory Corso, Andrei Codrescu, Philippe Soupault have tried
to develop a piquant humor within surrealism and to stay away from the grand
moments of the sublime.  This self-consciously small tradition that develpps
comedy in the place of tragedy may also develop friendship rather than the deep
hatred and Huge Principles of the current actors on the political stage.  I have
been wondering if there is stand-up comedy within extremist circles in either
Hamas, Al-Qaida, or whomever, or what they think of it.  Is it a purely secular
thing?  It seems to me that the Bush administration shares this appreciation of
the big sublime gesture.  Perhaps but only perhaps quieter aesthetic traditions
would make for a more lasting piece than this militarization of aesthetics that we
see going on where each side strives for a bigger and more shocking spectacle.  I
have no idea what a comic picturesque war would look like -- maybe leafleting
Baghdad with funny pictures of Saddam with a big nose or something, or maybe
Al-Qaida would have done better to have comedy training camps and to send trained
comedians who would slowly infiltrate the Tonight Show to get their viewpoint
across would have been much more fun and probably would have been less costly to
them, and us, and would have been more efficacious.  But meanwhile we're still
stuck with this humorless and dare I say rather gauche aesthetics of the military
sublime based on a tragic view of the divine.

Singer-Poet Rod McKuen Ends Exile, Gains Purpose

Sun May 18, 9:24 AM ET

By Steve James

NEW YORK (Reuters) - It would be all too easy to dismiss Rod McKuen as a
has-been and an old fogy.


After all, the poet, composer and singer just turned 70 at a time when
young rappers and nubile singer-songwriters rule the roost in what
passes today for performance poetry.


For good measure, McKuen, who is emerging from nearly a decade of
self-imposed isolation due to depression, thinks rap is "crap" and young
people today don't have the work ethics of their elders.


His image as a relic of days gone by was sealed too by his recent
Carnegie Hall show, which attracted the mostly gray-beard and blue-rinse
brigade.


But that's precisely the point, says the man who has sold 75 million
books of poetry and written such classic songs as "Love's Been Good to
Me" for Frank Sinatra (news) and "If You Go Away/Ne Me Quitte Pas," with
Jacques Brel.


McKuen, who has been a voice for his generation, be it the Beats in the
1950s or the Hippies during the Vietnam era, is still articulating the
thoughts and fears of those people who, like him, became parents and are
now grandparents.


"Getting old is like masturbation. You don't have to dress up any more,
and you only have to please yourself," McKuen said. "You only have to
prove things to yourself.


"I dreamed all my life of entertaining seniors. I am sick and tired of
seeing them warehoused," he told Reuters in a recent interview. "Nobody
entertains these people, so it will be free to people over 60," he said
of the tour that features him singing and reading his poetry.


Snowy-haired and bearded as he was in his 40s, the man who has written
some 1,500 songs credits this activism on behalf of older people with
giving him new purpose in life. That, along with Prozac, helped him
emerge from a long period of self-imposed exile from public life.


"IF YOU GO AWAY, AS I KNOW YOU MUST..."


"I woke up one morning in the early '90s and felt I had the whole weight
of the world on me. It was clinical depression.


"I never left the yard in three years and for five years I didn't answer
the phone," said McKuen, sipping a martini in a Manhattan hotel.


A doctor finally prescribed Prozac and within three months the hermit
phase ended. "Bingo! I vowed to never fall into a state like that again.



"I regret I didn't take personal responsibility sooner, but I want
people to know you can be cured. Life has been good and I don't want to
feel sorry for myself," he said.


McKuen is back touring in support of his latest work -- "A Safe Place to
Land" -- a book of poems with two CDs, which he sells over the Internet
from his California home for $40.


Having bought back the rights to most of his songs, recordings and TV
shows, McKuen is pretty much self-sufficient although the current tour
is sponsored by computer maker Hewlett-Packard Co. for whom he is now
acting as a spokesman as it targets older consumers.


McKuen was born in a Salvation Army hospital and never knew his father.
He left home at 11 and worked as a cowhand, a lumberjack, a ditch
digger, railroad worker and even a rodeo cowboy. He served in the Army
in Korea, was a contract player at Universal Studios and sang with the
Lionel Hampton band.





WRITING TO EXPLAIN

"I had less than four years formal education in my life," he said. "I
lived with my grandparents and we were less than poor. I learned to read
off the newspapers on the wall, that's how I learned to read Jack
London."

Asked to define himself, this man who has written poetry and songs, had
his film music nominated for Academy Awards (news - web sites) ("The
Prime of Miss Jean Brodie" and "A Boy Named Charlie Brown") and written
a best-seller about child abuse ("Finding My Father") thinks long and
hard before answering.

"I am best as a performer. I consider myself a singer-songwriter," he
finally replied. "I always wrote to explain my life, so writing is not a
goal, but a by-product.

"People often say 'I live for my art.' Bullshit! If you are given a
talent it's to be used. It's not in the private domain."

Summing up, McKuen harks back to the song he wrote for his idol,
Sinatra. "Life has been good to me and love has been good to me," he
said. "I've made a lot of money ... and spent it!"

Please join Rodrigo and I in lifting a glass of... something to, uh...
ourselves, Tuesday, May 27th, to celebrate the launch of his excellent book
of poems, Platform, and my curious book of essays and poems, Fashionable
Noise: On Digital Poetics, both just out from Atelos Press.

Where: Spoonbill and Sugartown bookstore, in the charming, little celebrated
gated community of Williamsburg, Brooklyn, on 218 Bedford Avenue.  It's the
L train, stupide! (as zee French might say) -- zee Bedford stop, head south
a few blocks.

What time: 7-9 (hours of the "magic light").

There will be wine, cheese, olives and depending on our attitudes toward
formalities a brief reading, but I doubt it.  I'm planning on selling my
book on at a slight discount -- $10 ($3 off) -- don't know what Rodrigo's
plans are but he might do the same.  Get it while it's cheap.  Tell friends
to get it while it's cheap.  Tell everyone.

Please read (but don't believe) the promo info below to be further persuaded
of the necessity of your presence at this event.  And there's nothing better
than a Tuesday night of loitering on the streets of Wburg!

Cheers,
Brian

Rodrigo Toscano's Platform is a political one; his writings are predicated
on the political conditions of contemporary life. But his work is not (and
will never be) predicted by those conditions; indeed, outwitting, unnerving,
and outspeaking the forces and figures clinging to control is one of his
signal artistic strategies. It would be correct to read Platform as a
triumphant product of precise and complex labor (thus adding to the
tradition set by of Louis Zukofsky). But where the spirit of Johann
Sebastian Bach informed Zukofsky's work, we would suggest that it is the
spirit of the Teatro Campesino that informs Toscano's  his poems carry out
brilliantly creative interventions. The works is bitingly inventive and yet
delicately meticulous; outrageous, funny, anti-hypocritical, and
"unfuckingrightgaggable," Platform is victory for the political intelligence
whose exercise is now, more than ever, a human necessity.

Rodrigo Toscano grew up in San Diego. After a few years in the San Francisco
Bay Area working as a social worker and an activist within the labor
movement, he moved to New York, where he continues this work. He is a
nationally influential writer, whose work along the intersections of social
and aesthetic activism is adding new dimensions to contemporary poetics.

Platform is Rodrigo Toscano's third book. His first book, The Disparities,
was published jointly by Green Integer and O Books in 2002. His second book,
Partisans (which, due to a variety of circumstances, came out before his
first), was published in 1999 by O Books.

Brian Kim Stefans' Fashionable Noise: On Digital Poetics eludes any singular
description  it is too various. At once, Fashionable Noise explodes with
ingredients of essay, games, and poetry, and it is always engaging, always
thought provoking. How does limitless replication and change affect a
dialogue one might try to have with another poet's words? What's so
interesting about the hidden code behind the link Walt Disney that
misdirects you, takes you to the wrong site? Stefans confronts these
questions, and the ease with which he simultaneously discusses,
investigates, and incorporates those elements that might make up a digital
poetics is astounding. Generating poetry with a computer program,
synthesizing Scots by using an algorithm accompanied by dictionaries,
employing an ICQ chat transcript as the conduit for delivering a significant
discussion on digital poetics: these are just a few examples of what readers
will find in this book. Although "the webwork, unlike the earthwork, can
never be photographed from a satellite perspective," Fashionable Noise: On
Digital Poetics is on the forefront of mapping out a rapidly emerging,
constantly morphing, virtual terrain.

Brian Kim Stefans is the author of Free Space Comix (1998), Gulf
(1998/2000), and Angry Penguins (2000). He has been an active presence on
the internet for several years, editing arras.net  a ceaselessly original
site devoted to new media poetry and poetics  and creating works such as
the acclaimed Flash poem "The Dreamlife of Letters" and a setting of the "e"
chapter of Christian Bk's Christian Bk's Eunoia. He is an active literary
and cultural critic, publishing frequently in the Boston Review, Jacket, and
elsewhere. He lives in New York City.

The Machines

Some machines came early,
others, late. Outside their own time,
the world doesn't really have room for them.

Heron's fountain, atl-atl, voltaic pile.
The famed mine shaft machinery in Falun. Curiosities:
The "pneumatic corn-sweep"
*Una macchina per riscaldare i piedi*

The machines that we notice are those
from another century: they seem to be placeless.
They become obvious, take on meaning.

Yet just what they mean, nobody knows.

The hydraulic mine device: an apparatus
with two shafts, which run in opposite directions,
made to convey force out over great distances.
What does the hydraulic mine device mean?

*The mines in the Harz anno 1723*

The lithograph swarms with people. Men,
as tiny as flies, ride up and down in the baskets.
And next to the foaming waterfall, illustration figure *j*,
"La Grande Machine," which runs all the drive-belts.

It would indeed be conceivable
that steam engine and general-mechanical-instrument,
Heron's fountain and voltaic pile
might all be combined. No one has done it.
Residue of possibilities.

A foreign language that no one has ever spoken.
And, strictly speaking, grammar itself
is another machine,
emitting, from the midst of innumerable sequences,
the mutter of communication:
"instruments of reproduction," the "procreative numbers"
"outcries," "stifled whispers."

When the words disappear, the grammar remains,
and that's what we call: a machine. Yet what it means,
nobody knows. A foreign language.

A totally foreign language.
A totally foreign language.
A totally foreign language.

The lithograph swarms with people. Words,
as tiny as flies, ride up and down in the baskets,
and next to the foaming waterfall, illustration figure *j*,
"La Grande Machine," which runs all the drive-belts.


--Lars Gustafsson, tr. Harriett Watts


from *Journey to the Center of the Earth*, 1966
in *The Stillness of the World before Bach*

In a message dated 5/18/03 2:51:20 PM, olsonjk@DELHI.EDU writes:

<< Kant says that big things like the sea, waterfalls, the stars at night
remind us
that there is a God.  I'm not sure how much Islamic aesthetics accepts this
idea.
It's a totally blank slate to me.  They are not permitted to have a pictorial
tradition, but it seemed to me that Bin Laden and Al Qaida have an intuitive
understanding of this tradition.  They like to work on big canvases and make
terrific tragedies. >>

Actually, but for 9/11, the attacks haven't been all that "terrific."  But I
get your point.  I doubt that Bin Laden thinks about the aesthetics of the
sublime (a redundancy?).  I could be wrong.  The Twin Towers symbolized U.S.
financial power, of course.  But that's a fairly obvious and flat
correspondence.  Since Allah is "the light that caresses the world," Bin
Laden need not rely on intuition any more than anyone else who embraces
religion.  The sublime is very much a part of Islamic tradition.  I do agree
with Stockhausen that 9/11 was a work of art, in the sense that horror is
always an aesthetic event.

<<I'm sort of disgusted by this because it lacks a sense of humor.  Kant
himself
denies that the humorous is ever aesthetic.  He says that humor is based on a
disappointment of expectations, and on the incongruous.  It's just a page or
two
in the Critique of Judgment.

I've been trying to rebuild the comic as an important aesthetic and political
criterion.  Just fumbling toward this idea intuitively that democracy requires
humor.  Kenneth Burke wrote that a cult of comedy was humanity's only hope
for the
future.  We're not getting this from the extremists, who prefer the Shock and
Awe
of the Aesthetics of the Sublime.>>

I think both were a bit extreme in their views.  Tragedy and comedy are
Siamese twins.  We are dogged by both faces, always.

<<What I'm trying to think about is a scaled down aesthetic of the comic
picturesque
-- difficult but amusing, the way that say, Seinfeld can be at its best for
instance when he's trying to decide whether soup by itself can be a meal.
This
doesn't seem to have come from the Old Testament, but from a quite different
tradition that is apparently developed as another kind of tradition within
Judaism
the way that the Sufis developed a kind of humor inside the Islamic tradition.
Somehow I think that this tradition has to be developed but to do so requires
another view of God altogether.  A god of small moments, of the enjoyment of
the
mist arising from a newly opened orange, etc.  Maybe even a clownish God.>>

We went down this road with the ancient Greeks, and later with the Vikings.
Aspects of pantheism and the Tao also relevant, as is Wicca.  After all,
you're describing the worship of nature, basically.  Clearly the god of the
Old Testament is not so different from what the Greeks imaged in terms of
anger and tricksterism (e.g., the "got ya" in the case of Abraham and Isaac).
 If we revisit what you describe, will things be better or worse.  I don't
know.  Perhaps we're already there.

<<It's something different going on in the brain.  The picturesque is not in
the
limbic system but primarily in the neo-cortex -- you have to think about it.
The
sublime is something awesome that goes down into the most primitive aspects
of the
brain.  You almost can't think about it.  It's shock and awe.z>>

This I'm not willing to assume.  But who knows?  I absolutely agree that you
have to "think about it."  That's what I've been saying.  The sublime,
however, does not escape this ring of language, of ideas.  You say you almost
can't think about it.  I say you must think it if it is to exist for you.
"Primitive" humans could think; they had the sublime because they had
language (and plenty of hallucinogens).  Before that, before language, there
was perhaps ONLY the primitive aspects of the brain, i.e., tissue and
chemicals and electrical impulses and unmediated (unknown) sensations.  The
idea such things carry aesthetic weight is just that:  an idea.  Aesthetics,
front to back, is ideational.

<<A lot of writers like Gregory Corso, Andrei Codrescu, Philippe Soupault
have tried
to develop a piquant humor within surrealism and to stay away from the grand
moments of the sublime.>>

I agree.  But doesn't this reaction have much to do with a sense of
powerlessness, a sense that the individual "means" nothing.  We find this
idea growing throughout modernism into postmodernism, in Beckett, in the best
works of Bob Dylan, in the death of the subject.  How can poets compete with
huge figures like Eliot who marked the end of tragedy as the most tragic
event of all?  When faced with a waste land, one can only rebuild in small
measures.  And, of course, the spread of pluralism in the west dispersed, and
so weakened, the effects (the import) of tragedy.  If we are powerless in a
world dominated by corporate concerns and religious fanaticism, then the
aesthetics of the absurd become an inevitable refuge.

But consider that both tragedy and comedy carry the other's trace,
internalize the other.  The fact is that life is tragedy in Aristotelian
terms.  Human beings aspire, but bear (bare) a tragic flaw (our very
humanity).  This is an important aspect of what has given meaning to our
lives, at least so far:  our story, the romance we all live.  Even those who
resist this view fall in love, have children, hopes for their children, etc.
And they cry, or dance, or something, at funerals.  From one point of view,
life repeats these small tears, each one a metonym for the grand tragedy.
From another point of view, the seemingly endless repetition seems absurd,
pointless.

<< I have no idea what a comic picturesque war would look like>>

Maybe we're already there.  Baudrillard wrote that the Gulf War did not
happen.  What he meant was that reality has become fiction, fiction reality.
The media, for one, has exchanged "real life" (if there ever was such a
thing) for a simulacrum.

I enjoy your posts also.  Best, Bill

I was a tad uneasy at the description of Tomlinson in 'Who is Charles
Tomlinson: a cautionary tale'. Granted, his work has its limitations, but
given the cultural environment he was writing in it deserves respect. I've
met him twice: once a decade and more ago, when I found him a bit 'icy', and
once the other year, when I discovered this rather sweet old buffer who was
very friendly and likeable. It's not that I don't have reservations about
the writing, but too I have them about Bunting or David Jones as well, and I
can't agree with your comments on Hughes, true, he was a very uneven writer,
I detest some of his stuff, but to call him a 'duffer' is going too far.
Without examining the question of any writer's level of intellectual
capacity all that matters is what a writer is capable of producing at their
best.

In my brain the hum of flipping

charg'd the noon with something

After having a book signed by one of the poets


I reflect on
how the afternoon sits
between the words
and the faces
that go with them.

These faces (weve seen
in the backs of books)
now taken away

like gifts well likely
forget in the unwrapping.

Oh, I see, MWP: 'tis the season where we use the Poetics List to slur
sans substance, is it? Why don't you spell out your brief vs. Camper?
Otherwise we'll be tossing rotten eggs and calling people who aren't
here "gnats" and "morons," which seems a rather tedious way to go.

I dunno where you're writing from, but I can think of no one in
Chicago who's done more for Brakhage or for experimental film than
Fred Camper (via his work in the -Chicago Reader-). Furthermore, the
webpage of Brakhage links that Fred maintains
(http://www.fredcamper.com/Film/BrakhageL.html) hardly seems the labor
of a "gnat." If anything there's too much "knowledge and authority" there.

So: do you care to substantiate and elaborate on your comment, MWP,
or shd we just pass your slur off as another Poetics List graffito?

Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; format=flowed

the shift key is a backwoods town, as Donne pointed out
William Wormswork to jam up that early bird, for 124 years the bird
stood at a safe distance & inched forward in slo-mo
a landmark of center-holding, a bird so obscure she couldn't even
BUY a cat-bite, you don't need too big a bucket to tote this poem
if you print this out you can fold it into a bird & enact this story for
the edification of your children, but free up plenty of time because
the bird has 35 years to go before she, or WW, hits the spot

A new book of poetic, fictive, and theoretical experiments and engagements
with belief and disbelief, edited by Robert Corbett and Rebecca Brown,

Camper's pathetic scribblings speak for themselves. They show the mind of
somebody who doesn't know how to see film and who relies on stock analyses
and wild analogies that bear only the most tenuous relationship to the
object being described. If his is the ultimate in experimental film support,
then I can only pray for its swift demise. To cite specific examples from
Mr. C's words would mean that I would have to refresh my reading of him,
which is a drudgery I have no desire to revisit. Brakhage has befriended
many great poets and his work speaks with a poet's voice. In my view, poets
are the ones who should be writing about him and keeping his voice alive,
not some dull-witted pedant who hasn't an ounce of poetry in his veins.

Gnat swatted.

Dear poetry friends,

I'm holding in  my hand a yellowing mass-market paperback of the
_Mentor Book of Major American Poets_.  This edition from 1960 is
still in print.  It begins with Edward Taylor and ends with Hart
Crane. (Actually it ends with Auden--- wha??)   (and there's no
Bradstreet!!)  This book is no good.

I need like a Norton Anthology of American Poetry, Anne Bradstreet
through 1975 or something.  Not a book that attempts to bring the
record right up to current, but something that at least has Ashbery
and Ginsberg in it.  With good footnotes, etc.

Suggestions?  I'm sure one of you book wonks out there can tell me
exactly what I need.

Estimably,
Aaron S. Belz

Rae--this happens to  me all the time. My computer seems deaf to  the
distinction itoffers between listwide and private. So good to meet up in
Seattle. Your new poems are a thrill and I only wish 'd heard more.I'm sorry
if  went on too long--that spabnish poem was a bear.Be well--David

Transmissions and Empires


the following list of representative countries and domains was gathered
from google - the first 100 entries of the (anglicized) country name
filtered to the domain. the british commonwealth has a strong showing; the
u.s. is weak, taking .com, .mil, etc. for granted. some countries divide
among others. google of course is never neutral, and the search was in the
linguistic empire of english.

Wish I had been there. But not really, because then I might not have
made it to the Wah Bash in Calgary; anyway, I want to report that the
latter was a hoot at all times, and also that Bromige's new poems,
read here in Vancouver by the poet, were spectacularly good.

Preliminary investigation into the controlled breakdown of meaning.

A PEEK UNDER THE HOOD: What I am doing here is interweaving a text (Text A)
with itself (Text B), selecting from Text A at its current position if the
binary control-pattern is 0, and from Text B's current position if it is a
1. The pattern being used in this particular case is:

$tptA = "0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 6 5 4 3 2 1";
$tptB = "7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0 1 2 3 4 5 6";

A Spy Machine of Darpa's Dreams

By Noah Shachtman
Story location: http://www.wired.com/news/business/0,1367,58909,00.html

02:00 AM May. 20, 2003 PT

It's a memory aid! A robotic assistant! An epidemic detector! An
all-seeing, ultra-intrusive spying program!

The Pentagon is about to embark on a stunningly ambitious research
project designed to gather every conceivable bit of information about a
person's life, index it and make it searchable.

What national security experts and civil libertarians want to know is,
why would the Defense Department want to do such a thing?

The embryonic LifeLog program would dump everything an individual does
into a giant database: every e-mail sent or received, every picture
taken, every Web page surfed, every phone call made, every TV show
watched, every magazine read.

All of this -- and more -- would combine with information gleaned from a
variety of sources: a GPS transmitter to keep tabs on where that person
went; audio-visual sensors to capture what he or she sees or says; and
biomedical monitors to keep track of the individual's health.

This gigantic amalgamation of personal information could then be used to
"trace the 'threads' of an individual's life," to see exactly how a
relationship or events developed, according to a briefing from the
Defense Advanced Projects Research Agency, LifeLog's sponsor.

Someone with access to the database could "retrieve a specific thread of
past transactions, or recall an experience from a few seconds ago or
from many years earlier . by using a search-engine interface."

On the surface, the project seems like the latest in a long line of
Darpa's "blue sky" research efforts, most of which never make it out of
the lab. But Steven Aftergood, a defense analyst with the Federation of
American Scientists, says he is worried.

With its controversial Total Information Awareness database project,
Darpa already is planning on tracking all of an individual's
"transactional data" -- like what we buy and who gets our e-mail.

Aftergood said he believes LifeLog could go far beyond that, adding
physical information (like how we feel) and media data (like what we
read) to this transactional data.

"LifeLog has the potential to become something like 'TIA cubed,'" he
said.

In the private sector, a number of LifeLog-like efforts already are
underway to digitally archive one's life -- to create a "surrogate
memory," as minicomputer pioneer Gordon Bell calls it.

Bell, now with Microsoft, scans all his letters and memos, records his
conversations, saves all the Web pages he's visited and e-mails he's
received and puts them into an electronic storehouse dubbed MyLifeBits.

Darpa's LifeLog would take this concept several steps further by
tracking where people go and what they see.

That makes the project similar to the work of University of Toronto
professor Steve Mann. Since his teen years in the 1970s, Mann, a
self-styled "cyborg," has worn a camera and an array of sensors to
record his existence. He claims he's convinced 20 to 30 of his current
and former students to do the same. It's all part of an experiment into
"existential technology" and "the metaphysics of free will."

Darpa isn't quite so philosophical about LifeLog. But the agency does
see some potential battlefield uses for the program.

"The technology could allow the military to develop computerized
assistants for warfighters and commanders that can be more effective
because they can easily access the user's past experiences," Darpa
spokeswoman Jan Walker speculated in an e-mail.

It also could allow the military to develop more efficient computerized
training systems, she said: Computers could remember how each student
learns and interacts with the training system, then tailor the lessons
accordingly.

John Pike, director of defense think tank GlobalSecurity.org, said he
finds the explanations "hard to believe."

"It looks like an outgrowth of Total Information Awareness and other
Darpa homeland security surveillance programs," he added in an e-mail.

Sure, LifeLog could be used to train robotic assistants. But it also
could become a way to profile suspected terrorists, said Cory Doctorow,
with the Electronic Frontier Foundation. In other words, Osama bin
Laden's agent takes a walk around the block at 10 each morning, buys a
bagel and a newspaper at the corner store and then calls his mother. You
do the same things -- so maybe you're an al Qaeda member, too!

"The more that an individual's characteristic behavior patterns --
'routines, relationships, and habits' -- can be represented in digital
form, the easier it would become to distinguish among different

Scientists analyst, wrote in an e-mail.

In its LifeLog report, Darpa makes some nods to privacy protection, like
when it suggests that "properly anonymized access to LifeLog data might
support medical research and the early detection of an emerging
epidemic."

But before these grand plans get underway, LifeLog will start small.
Right now, Darpa is asking industry and academics to submit proposals
for 18-month research efforts, with a possible 24-month extension.
(Darpa is not sure yet how much money it will sink into the program.)

The researchers will be the centerpiece of their own study.

Dear Aaron,  I like Cary Nelson's Modern American Poetry anthology (2000) =
which has the added benefit of a very useful and burgeoning website.  But =
it's really 20th century, with Whitman and Dickinson.  Glad to hear you're =
insistent on Bradstreet: maybe a claim could be made for her as a 20th =
century poet: certainly her subject matter would qualify her.  Don't know =
how she got away with breaking so many rules.  Early Americanists out =
there: please explain.

Dear poetry friends,

I'm holding in  my hand a yellowing mass-market paperback of the
_Mentor Book of Major American Poets_.  This edition from 1960 is
still in print.  It begins with Edward Taylor and ends with Hart
Crane. (Actually it ends with Auden--- wha??)   (and there's no
Bradstreet!!)  This book is no good.

I need like a Norton Anthology of American Poetry, Anne Bradstreet
through 1975 or something.  Not a book that attempts to bring the
record right up to current, but something that at least has Ashbery
and Ginsberg in it.  With good footnotes, etc.

Suggestions?  I'm sure one of you book wonks out there can tell me
exactly what I need.

Estimably,
Aaron S. Belz

There's a range of noteworthy "word & music" events happening in NYC in
early June which the Electronic Music Foundation is producing on June
3, 4 and 5 at the Chelsea Art Museum, W 22nd Street and 11th Avenue.
It's one of the most beautiful spaces in New York. Check it out:

Concert 1
Tuesday, June 3 at 8pm.
Words & Music

Chris Mann's Plato Songs. The space as larynx: F is always in speaker
5, A is always speaker 7, T is always 12 .... 16 speakers, 42 phonemes,
1 voice, real-time spectral analysis software solution by Holland
Hopson and R. Luke DuBois, text by Chris Mann.

Joel Chadabe's Many Times Chris. Mann reads and Chadabe electronically
multiplies and transforms his voice, sending it around the room, left,
right, up, down, everywhere, so that it all becomes a fascinating
verbal and musical fabric.

Joan La Barbara / Kenneth Goldsmith's 73 Poems. La Barbara performs her
timbral settings and transformations of Kenneth Goldsmith's words,
bringing poetry and sound into an intimate symbiosis.


Concert 2
Wednesday, June 4 at 8pm
Ne(x)tworks

Ne(x)tworks is a new group of performing composers presenting a program
of original electro-acoustic music, including previews of two new
operas by Kenji Bunch and Joan La Barbara in addition to works by other
members of the group.

                            Joan La Barbara, voice

Alvin Lucier Retrospective

A conversation at 6pm with this sound art pioneer.

Then at 8 ...

Music for Solo Performer, for performer with EEG pickup, amplifiers,
and percussion instruments. Lucier transmits his amplified alpha brain
waves to vibrate percussion instruments placed around the hall.

Bird and Person Dyning, for performer with microphones, amplifiers,
loudspeakers and electric birdcall. Lucier utilizes time delays between
birdcalls and microphones to produce heterodyning which results in
phantom sound images.

Disappearances, for string quartet. The Ne(x)tworks string quartet,
realizing Lucier's poetic and musical instructions, alters timbre and
produces special acoustic phenomena through slight variations in
intonation.

Wave Songs, for female voice with pure wave oscillators, based on 11
Wave Paintings of artist Lee Lozano. Joan La Barbara sings with
precisely pitched intonation, exploring the musical space between pure
waves and slow pulsing rhythms resulting from the delicate interaction
of live performer microtonally interacting with oscillators.

Ron <ron.silliman@VERIZON.NET>:
A Spy Machine of Darpa's Dreams

By Noah Shachtman
Story location:
http://www.wired.com/news/business/0,1367,58909,00.html

02:00 AM May. 20, 2003 PT

It's a memory aid! A robotic assistant! An epidemic
detector! An
all-seeing, ultra-intrusive spying program!

The Pentagon is about to embark on a stunningly
ambitious research
project designed to gather every conceivable bit of
information about a
person's life, index it and make it searchable.

What national security experts and civil libertarians
want to know is,
why would the Defense Department want to do such a
thing?

The embryonic LifeLog program would dump everything an
individual does
into a giant database: every e-mail sent or received,
every picture
taken, every Web page surfed, every phone call made,
every TV show
watched, every magazine read.

All of this -- and more -- would combine with
information gleaned from a
variety of sources: a GPS transmitter to keep tabs on
where that person
went; audio-visual sensors to capture what he or she
sees or says; and
biomedical monitors to keep track of the individual's
health.

This gigantic amalgamation of personal information
could then be used to
"trace the 'threads' of an individual's life," to see
exactly how a
relationship or events developed, according to a
briefing from the
Defense Advanced Projects Research Agency, LifeLog's
sponsor.

Someone with access to the database could "retrieve a
specific thread of
past transactions, or recall an experience from a few
seconds ago or
from many years earlier . by using a search-engine
interface."

On the surface, the project seems like the latest in a
long line of
Darpa's "blue sky" research efforts, most of which
never make it out of
the lab. But Steven Aftergood, a defense analyst with
the Federation of
American Scientists, says he is worried.

With its controversial Total Information Awareness
database project,
Darpa already is planning on tracking all of an
individual's
"transactional data" -- like what we buy and who gets
our e-mail.

Aftergood said he believes LifeLog could go far beyond
that, adding
physical information (like how we feel) and media data
(like what we
read) to this transactional data.

"LifeLog has the potential to become something like
'TIA cubed,'" he
said.

In the private sector, a number of LifeLog-like
efforts already are
underway to digitally archive one's life -- to create
a "surrogate
memory," as minicomputer pioneer Gordon Bell calls it.

Bell, now with Microsoft, scans all his letters and
memos, records his
conversations, saves all the Web pages he's visited
and e-mails he's
received and puts them into an electronic storehouse
dubbed MyLifeBits.

Darpa's LifeLog would take this concept several steps
further by
tracking where people go and what they see.

That makes the project similar to the work of
University of Toronto
professor Steve Mann. Since his teen years in the
1970s, Mann, a
self-styled "cyborg," has worn a camera and an array
of sensors to
record his existence. He claims he's convinced 20 to
30 of his current
and former students to do the same. It's all part of
an experiment into
"existential technology" and "the metaphysics of free
will."

Darpa isn't quite so philosophical about LifeLog. But
the agency does
see some potential battlefield uses for the program.

"The technology could allow the military to develop
computerized
assistants for warfighters and commanders that can be
more effective
because they can easily access the user's past
experiences," Darpa
spokeswoman Jan Walker speculated in an e-mail.

It also could allow the military to develop more
efficient computerized
training systems, she said: Computers could remember
how each student
learns and interacts with the training system, then
tailor the lessons
accordingly.

John Pike, director of defense think tank
GlobalSecurity.org, said he
finds the explanations "hard to believe."

"It looks like an outgrowth of Total Information
Awareness and other
Darpa homeland security surveillance programs," he
added in an e-mail.

Sure, LifeLog could be used to train robotic
assistants. But it also
could become a way to profile suspected terrorists,
said Cory Doctorow,
with the Electronic Frontier Foundation. In other
words, Osama bin
Laden's agent takes a walk around the block at 10 each
morning, buys a
bagel and a newspaper at the corner store and then
calls his mother. You
do the same things -- so maybe you're an al Qaeda
member, too!

"The more that an individual's characteristic behavior
patterns --
'routines, relationships, and habits' -- can be
represented in digital
form, the easier it would become to distinguish among
different
individuals, or to monitor one," Aftergood, the
Federation of American
Scientists analyst, wrote in an e-mail.

In its LifeLog report, Darpa makes some nods to
privacy protection, like
when it suggests that "properly anonymized access to
LifeLog data might
support medical research and the early detection of an
emerging
epidemic."

But before these grand plans get underway, LifeLog
will start small.
Right now, Darpa is asking industry and academics to
submit proposals
for 18-month research efforts, with a possible
24-month extension.
(Darpa is not sure yet how much money it will sink
into the program.)

The researchers will be the centerpiece of their own
study.

Like a game show, winning this Darpa prize eventually
will earn the
lucky scientists a trip for three to Washington, D.C.
Except on this
excursion, every participating scientist's e-mail to
the travel agent,
every padded bar bill and every mad lunge for a cab
will be monitored,
categorized and later dissected.

Dear Aaron and all,

In fact, Norton has just put out an anthology called
_The Norton Anthology of Modern and Contemporary
Poetry_.  It's enormous--two volumes--but starts with
Whitman, so probably not early enough for you, Aaron,
but it's still pretty cool.  It includes a lot of
rather unusual suspects (Reznikoff, Oppen) along with
the more typical fare, plus poetics.  I'm personally
pretty psyched about it.

Arielle

Hi everyone,

I am teaching a junior-level required advanced
composition course in a management program (at the
Culinary Institute of America). This semester  I
decided to focus the course on writings about war and
tried to choose books that focused more on how folks
experience war, and how they represent war, and maybe
less directly on what the particular politics of a
given war were, though when and how the question of
the politics comes in provides our most fruitful
discussions.

The problem is that I required the book "9/12" by
Eliot Weinberger based on how it was described to me
("personal account of a New York City resident the day
after, the week after, the month after, and the year
after 9/11/01"); I'm finding it specifically political
and mostly political.

The other books I'm using are The Things They Carry by
Tim O'Brien, A Novel Without a Name by Duong Thu
Huoung, Memory for Forgetfulness by Mahmoud Darwish,
Azimuth by Rachel Tzvia Back, and Bosnia Elegies by
Adrian Oktenberg.

So my double question is

1) am I copping out by not wanting to use "9/12" for
its blatant and fierce politics? (Even Darwish, in the
particular book I'm using, touches on the politics
only lightly)
2) does anyone know of any powerful, human 9/11
writing that I might use in the course, regardless of
what I decide about "9/12"?

It's not quite an "academic" question--I teach at a
small, fairly conservative school. Whether or not I
will take heat for my classroom choice is (seriously)
of no real concern to me in this book selection; what
*is* a concern is the integrity of the students'
education: what I can expect them to learn if I
sweeten it, what I can expect them to reject because
it comes on too strong.

I'm looking forward to hearing some good advice from
you gang.

Kazim

F Marinetti's Futurist Cookbook. It's been awhile since I've looked at it
and I can't find it in my collection (and I even published an English
translation in late eighties when I was the director at Bedford Arts,
Publishers! Thieves in the house!)    But it's a wonderful book that I wd
particularly recommend for use at the culinary institute. His dining room
installations are as imaginative as they get, and not one recipe is edible.

What this has to do with war - recent or past - I am not sure. Marinetti's
futurism turned into fascism and support of Mussolini.

If it has been reprinted (it was a very popular book for us, The Book Club
even picked it up)  I do recommend the book as a device to challenge and
humor the sincerity of the fundamentalist gourmet techno obsessive   (and
maybe that fundamentalist attitude has something to do with the way people
construct and support wars among other things?)

Good luck on the pedagogic grill!

My suggestion for the person looking for the anthology
of American contemporary poetry is to look at these
edited by Roger Weingarten and Jack Myers:

New American Poets of the 80's
New American Poets of the 90's
Poets of the New Millenium

Almost certainly not consciously.  What interests me about him though is that he
is always dressed elegantly, and looks good, even in combat fatigues.  Also, he is
a poet.  He has about twenty poems that I know were translated into Dutch, but to
my knowledge they haven't been translated into English.  He is apparently a good
stylist and knows the traditions of Arabic poetry and refers to them in his poems.

I think they are possibly different.  Comedy is immanent, almost Darwinian,
tragedy on the other hand was originally developed in deference to Dionysos, at
least in the classical western tradition.  Already Aristotle didn't understand
comedy from within a religious framework but they had a religious perspective.

What I think about a lot is the adequacy of a given language to reality.  For
instance, some languages are totally inadequate.  Not just obsolete, but
completely in reference to a world view that makes one less able to understand
reality.  For instance, astrology is completely inadequate.  It never had any
reference to reality.  Perhaps a more extreme example would be phrenology.  Hegel,
in one of two jokes in the Phenomenology, said that anybody who thinks that the
bumps on peoples' heads determines their character deserves a bump on the head.

Although I am a Lutheran, I am also and insistently a Darwinian, because I think
the language developed by Darwin is adequate, that is, that it explains reality.
How I get out of this is that Luther had a two kingdoms' idea in which heaven was
different than this world.  This world runs on its own terms.  I see Darwin's
understanding of this world as pretty exact.

Comedy is about the struggle for survival.  Wit is one of the better tools
needed.  And a good understanding of the world, developed through an understanding
of immanence.

So I see the language that Bush and Bin Laden as using (along with many others) as
not exactly conducive to understanding but mired in the aesthetics of tragedy.
Because of their language systems they must talk in terms of sacrifice, and
because of this, to act requires violence.

In comedy this isn't necessarily so.  For instance, in P.G. Wodehouse entire
novels go by without even a reference to death.  The only violence in one book is
a water-bottle is popped at the foot of Bertie's bed.  So the aesthetic of the
book doesn't require bloodshed.


> After all,
> you're describing the worship of nature, basically.

-- Not worship of it, but rusing within it.



> But consider that both tragedy and comedy carry the other's trace,
> internalize the other.  The fact is that life is tragedy in Aristotelian
> terms.  Human beings aspire, but bear (bare) a tragic flaw (our very

-- We don't have the book on comedy but it points in a different direction.
Towards a comedy of survival -- the structure of a tragedy is that it goes from
good to bad.  In comedy it goes from bad to good.  The Three Stooges end up
married and working as brain surgeons.

This needn't be absurdism.  It can be based on two kingdoms' ideology -- already
operating throughout Kant, Kierkegaard, Tillich, and others.  The idea that this
world is an animal world (best described by Darwin) but somehow still under a
divinity who leaves it to us.  According to many Islamists, this bipartite
structure is not part of that tradition, but it is strong in Lutheran thought.
America is only 3% Lutheran, so the ideas of that strand are only known through
northern European philosophy of the 19th century, I suppose.

Bush is not a two kingdoms' thinker.  He wants God to rule here right now.  I hate
this idea.  Somebody was bringing up Kant a while back.  The reason he's cool is
that he separates ethics and aesthetics, this world and the next.  Two kingdoms.
This is what Lyotard is getting at when he talks about separating the domains
under postmodernism after Kant.  It's not absurdism as in Beckett.  There's hope
in it.

I think the Sufis are on to something similar when they say, "Go ahead and look
for God, but tie up your camel first."

As the stunted attention-span of the mainstream-media loses focus on the

We created this webpage of war and ruin for your input.

sacrifice your life for your country?/ Do you believe that someone who
does not support the head of your country is a traitor?/ Is your country
at peace?/Is your country at war?/ Do you believe suicide bombers are
cowards?

I'm still missing the substance of your criticism, MWP. It's
self-evidently vague and lazy invective, so far as I can see.

"Pathetic scribblings"? "Dull-witted pedant"? This is just
name-calling! What's next? Face-painting? You've pulled a nice twist
by accusing Camper of both "stock analyses" and "wild analogies"
("wild analogies" actually might be rather poetic, yes?), but it
sounds to me like you're just making that up. In fact, when you
declare that Camper's criticism "bear[s] only the most tenuous
relationship to the object being described," you make it sound like
you've seen the films Camper is reviewing in the link I forwarded.
But in fact you haven't even read the review!?!

The holier-than-thou dogma vis-a-vis Camper that you're trying to
traffick in, MWP, is coming across as little more than ill-informed
and shallow calumny. Your short-circuiting obsession with Camper is
distracting the rest of us from Brakhage. Spare us your stale bile.
Better still, take it to Frameworks (http://www.hi-beam.net/fw.html),
where I'm sure you'll find many welcome readers, and where Camper
himself can respond to the cross-eyed castigations you're trying and
failing to pin on him. You're peddling malicious generalizations that
float free from any objective standard -- that shd be apparent to any
level-headed participant in this forum who takes the time to consider
the evidence.

        *

I haven't seen -Panels for the Walls of Heaven-, but Camper's
description of it strikes me as responsible to what late-Brakhage
handpainted filmwork I have seen; his description is certainly remote
from anything "stock" or "wild." In fact, there's so little writing
on Brakhage's late work I'm not even certain what a "stock analysis"
of it would look like -- perhaps something that dusted off a few
Annette Michelson tropisms to see how they worked with the new stuff,
or that tried to squeeze the late-films into the strong reading that
P. Adams
Sitney supplied in -Visionary Cinema-? One of Camper's most valuable
contributions to Brakhage scholarship is the caution with which he
handles the critical dogmas that invariably barnacles the work. True,
he runs the risk of turning his own position into something of a
dogma -- isn't this always the case? Nathless, it was Brakhage
himself who recommended to Criterion that Camper be the primary
consultant for the DVD they'll be releasing later this year. (See
http://www.criterionco.com/asp/release.asp?id=184 for details about
that release. While I'm pasting in links, checkout the transcripts
from a radio show Brakhage did in the early 1980s (another resource
courtesy of Camper):
http://www.fredcamper.com/Brakhage/TestofTime.html -- in them
Brakhage speaks about a heaping range of music, poetry, film, drama,
and much more.)

        *

Brakhage's last films are being screened in Chicago this evening (at
the Film Center, 7:45). With any luck I'll see one or two of you
there.

Stephen Vincent's wonderful Walking, with a dandy photo of Stephen on the
back, is still available to list members from Junction Press at 20% off
cover, which makes it a ridiculous $7.20, +$3.00 for package and postage.
Backchannel for details.

the boy stood on the burning deck
his father brave was dead -
the ship was sinking rapidly -
the chaplain turned and said

sing out, my lad, the tearful strains
will god almighty reach -
it's time to pray and time to die
no longer time to preach -

the boy took heed and left his perch
against the stalwart mast -
and boy and preacher sang to god

i'd look back thru the POETIX archives; charles bernstein, brian
stefans, gary sullivan, lee ann brown and others all wrote long
firsthand accounts of life in NYC during and after 9/11. they were
quite beautiful, emotional and not political.
ps what do you teach at the CIA?  i've got a friend who wants to take
a short course on baking.

Maria,

so bizarre to read your simple query on what someone teaches at the culinary
institute, because, after u mention NYC and 9/11 and not being political, u
refer to culinary institute as CIA. These times get the mind bending, they do.

as ever,

Will a Spell-Check Check G=E0idhlig? =20

By Andrew Heavens=20
Story location: http://www.wired.com/news/culture/0,1284,58778,00.html

02:00 AM May. 21, 2003 PT

Scottish Gaelic, one of the Western world's least spoken languages,
could get a boost toward survival from Microsoft.=20

Speakers of the ancient tongue -- used by just 58,650 people and falling
-- plan to ask Microsoft managers to include a custom spell-checker with
the language in the Office suite.=20

The outcome of their talks could have wider implications for speakers of
other minority languages, from Icelandic to Catalan, who have long
campaigned for customized versions of Microsoft's ubiquitous software.=20

Campaigners said a Gaelic spell-checker could help reverse its slow
decline.=20

The number of Scottish Gaelic speakers has fallen 11 percent in the last
10 years to an all time low, according to the latest U.K. census figures
released in February. Most were concentrated in rural areas in the north
of Scotland.=20

Allan Campbell, chief executive of Bord na G=E0idhlig, or the Gaelic
Board, in Inverness said a spell-checker would give students and other
speakers the confidence to overcome centuries of dominance by Scotland's
English-speaking establishment.=20

"One of our main problems is that there are thousands of people who
speak the language but can't read or write it," said Campbell. "It
wasn't encouraged in school."=20

Gaelic folklore is full of old stories of teachers literally beating the
language out of children.=20

"Over the years, Gaelic speakers were taught that it wasn't really a
worthy language," said Campbell. "It was just something for consenting
adults in private. The idea of having a spell-checker would be a huge
boost for people who feel their Gaelic is not up to scratch."=20

A spell-checker, he said, would give people more confidence to use the
language in everything from school essays and e-mails to business and
government correspondence. It would also standardize Scottish Gaelic
spelling which, until recently, varied from region to region.=20

If Microsoft gives the go-ahead for Scottish Gaelic, supporters will
have a head start on the process of actually building a spell-checker.
They will be able to build on an engine that's already been developed
for Irish Gaelic (a closely related language) and released by Microsoft
in February.=20

A team from the European Language Institute, which specializes in
writing dictionaries for all languages used by local governments in
Europe, has already started developing a database of 65,000 Scottish
Gaelic words for a trial version.=20

Leo McNeir, who is leading the language team, will need to build his
lexicon up to 250,000 for the final version. After that, Microsoft would
test it to make sure it doesn't clash with any of its software packages.
If the testing period for Irish is anything to go by, that could take up
to two years.=20

"This would be a real coming of age for Scottish Gaelic," said McNeir.
"It would be a rite of passage for what is a lovely, lyrical, delicate
language."=20

The Scottish Gaelic delegation, which plans to visit Microsoft's office
in Dublin, Ireland, will include representatives of Bord na G=E0idhlig =
and
the development agency Comunn na G=E0idhlig, as well as people from The
University of Dublin, Trinity College and the Linguistics Institute of
Ireland who worked on the Irish Gaelic spell-checker.=20

A Microsoft representative said he could not comment on their request
ahead of the meeting.=20

Microsoft's Office suite currently ships in 18 languages and the company
has been persuaded to support minority tongues in the past. It developed
a version of Windows for Nynorsk -- Norway's second language -- in
December, reportedly after Norway threatened to boycott Microsoft
software in its schools. It will also "translate" Windows into Dzongkha,
a language spoken in Bhutan, after a charity agreed to fund the
development work.=20

Nicholas Ostler of the English Foundation for Endangered Languages said
Scottish Gaelic is currently 1,135th in the table of about 2,000 known
languages with fully developed written systems. In all, about 6,800
languages exist, most only spoken.=20

While Gaelic is definitely suffering, he added, it has a long way to go
before it reaches the position occupied by about 50 languages that have
only one surviving speaker. Among those is Eyak, spoken by Marie Smith
from Prince William Sound in Alaska.=20

The spread of television and the Internet to even the most remote
corners of the world is taking most of the blame for the decline of
minority languages, said Ostler. Some linguists estimate that up to 90
percent could be gone by the end of the century.=20

_6 Regurgitive Rules of InterNet.Art_


1. _No 4.Thought_

This [re]hashed & dangerous method of preempting meaning has everything
2
do with the concussive nature of the potential audience. Make sure 2
instill great clunking swathes of theoretical loadings in all work, no
matter how small or insignificant. Be sure to mask the quality of the
work[s] with liberal amounts of anti_progressive rhetoric in order 2
ensure
substantial post-post_modemist [read: interpreted as modernism]
interest.


2. _No M.mersion_

The No M.mersion rule is all 2 do with FX. Rampantly use FX predicated
on
the cartesian or the sensory [ie visuality overcoding] in all
InterNet.art,
regardless of appropriateness or relevancy.


3. _No More InterNet.art 4 the Sake of X.pression_

No more InterNet.art will be produced using x.pression as a template or
process. Anything that can b traced 2 a verifiable transitive or
predominant aesthetic is 2 be rejected as hackneyed [ie overcoded] + is
2 b
thoroughly & rigorously laughed at.


4. _No Simulacra_

There is to b no use of discernable representation. This includes any
type
of format, form, or function including overt referencing, appropriation,
reappropriation, construction, structure, deconstruction,
deappropriation,
rehashing, sampling, digitizing, reworking, mixing, layering,
Foucaulting
etc, blah. This is man[out]dated in order 2 develop a static, isolated
feel
that reflects the current economic-budgeting trend 2wards parochial
orientation [read: insularisation] + destruction of any burgeoning
sense of
reticulated spaces.


5. _No Subject_

There will b no references in any Internet.artworks that xplicitly
refer to
_subject_. Instead, make sure 2 drench your works with substantial
amounts
of pre-packaged scene_approved lingo that references manifesto-like
assignations or quasi-radical directives.


6. _No Connection_.

There is 2 b no connection in the promotion or distribution of
InterNet.art
unless this material can b adequately subverted via the ability of
said_artists 2 project a believable authority[-aping]/critiquer stance.
If
this is realized at the xpense of establishing context or sustained
conceptual rigor, all the betta.

<< What I think about a lot is the adequacy of a given language to reality.
For
instance, some languages are totally inadequate.  Not just obsolete, but
completely in reference to a world view that makes one less able to understand
reality. >>

You're clearly working off a couple of assumptions here.  You assume a
single, stable reality "out there," waiting to be xeroxed by language,
disappointed by a given language's limitations.  I'm not at all sure that's
the case.  I don't know how such a determination might be achieved.  If a
given language seems inadequate, isn't that because LANGUAGE (in the form of
another "tongue"--say, English as opposed to Latin) has created a different
dominant "reality."   Quantum mechanics seems more sympathetic to that view.
Your assumption harkens back to Newtonian physics, a point of view Einstein
dismissed quite a long time ago.  Of course, science could very well do a 180
degree turn one day, and land again in Newton's lap.

As for Astrology--well, yes, its ontological value is suspect in the language
of a more sophisticated science, to say the least.  But every system carries
within it the flaw that will dispel it, including whichever world view is
current.  Is Astrology dismissed because it is inadequate to reality, or
because a different semiotics has created a different system?  And has it
really been dismissed?  Has Latin?  Don't they endure within the dominant
system as ghosts, as deviances necessary to the dominant system's identity
and expressive function?  Like an internal organ that cannot be felt but
whose presence is nevertheless crucial to the body's functioning?  An example
relevant to this list might be the former and illusory, severe division
between art and science.  It's been clear for a long time now that science
and art collapse into one another.  Again, the quantum world indicates that
this interdependency, this weave, has always obtained.  Working as a
scientist, one may not "feel" the art, and vice versa.  Yet each discipline
both identifies and undermines the other.

<<Although I am a Lutheran, I am also and insistently a Darwinian, because I
think
the language developed by Darwin is adequate, that is, that it explains
reality.
How I get out of this is that Luther had a two kingdoms' idea in which heaven
was
different than this world.  This world runs on its own terms.  I see Darwin's
understanding of this world as pretty exact.>>

Though I respect your faith, and Murat's, I can't follow you there.  So I'll
leave that bit alone.  The details of Darwinian evolution theory have been
pounded by science, as I'm sure you know, though in the general Darwin still
rules.

<<Not worship of it, but rusing within it.>>

Rusing within nature?  Not sure what you mean, but that's probably my
failing.  Getting a tad gooey about the mist an orange gives off (your
example)--if that's "rusing," then I'm with you.

<<-- We don't have the book on comedy but it points in a different direction.
Towards a comedy of survival -- the structure of a tragedy is that it goes
from
good to bad.  In comedy it goes from bad to good.  The Three Stooges end up
married and working as brain surgeons.>>

Well, this sort of linear thinking has long been suspect.  I don't think it
works this way.  But you could be right.  Believe me, I wouldn't mind a
little bad to good in the world.  But I don't think one can "survive" without
the other.  "Nature cultures" (most of them "primitive") understood that good
and evil walked the road together.  This fairly recent obsession--on the part
of techno cultures--with eliminating evil (e.g., Bush and Islamic
fundamentalism which is also, ironically, a techno culture) can, at best,
repress evil (along with the human)--where it inevitably becomes more and
more powerful, more and more antagonistic, more and more dangerous, more and
more dominant, more and more HUMAN.  After all, good can only defeat evil by
becoming evil, by employing evil's methods, fighting fire with fire, so to
speak.  History teaches us that the destruction of evil always leaves evil in
charge.  Absurd?  You bet.

    You write:  (quoted from Dave Elkins' email)
"I'm more interested
in the type of truth to be found in the artistic process (for lack of a
better term) that cannot be found in any other way.  Paul Tillich pointed to
this when he said that artistic symbols open up dimensions of our inner
lives that cannot be accessed in any other way.  Tillich pointed out, for
example, that when one attends a great play, there is a type of revelation
that sometimes occurs that changes one forever.  It's what the Greeks called
aleitheia -- a deeper kind of truth.  Psychotherapy depends on this same
kind of process that artists who paint, sculpt, write know so well.   It's a
type of truth whose process of discovery has better analogues in the
creative process than in the scientific process.

Dunno, but Frank O'Hara said "Nobody should experience anything they don't =
need to, if they don't like poetry bully for them, I like the movies too.  =
And after all, only Whitman and Crane and Williams, of the American poets, =
are better than the movies."  He then went on to improve immeasurably (as =
boxers are to y-fronts) on Frost's tennis net analogy: "As for measure and =
other technical apparatus, that's just common sense: if you're going to =
buy a pair of pants you want them to be tight enough so everyone will want =
to go to bed with you."

Maired, Arielle, and others who responded to my request--- I
appreciate these book suggestions and will likely order these books.
After hours of perusing lists of anthologies, I think I found the very
one, however:

  The New Oxford Book of American Verse
  by Richard Ellmann (Editor)

  * Hardcover: 1128 pages ; Dimensions (in inches): 2.10 x 8.75 x 5.76
  * Publisher: Oxford University Press; (October 1976)
  * ISBN: 0195020588


It begins with Bradstreet and carries on right past Ginsberg and into
the seventies!!  I have yet to see a hard copy, but on first blush it
seems exactly what I've been seeking.

Thanks, all,
Aaron

Dear Friends:

Some of you may be interested in what is stated in the text of the

Kathy Halbreich, Director
Walker Art Center
725 Vineland Place
Minneapolis, MN 55403
USA
fax: 612 375 7618

May 16, 2003

Kathy Halbreich,

We are writing to express our deep sadness at the decision taken by
the Walker Art Center to dismiss Steve Dietz and to terminate the
curatorial programme of new media initiatives and to implore you to
not forget your institution's own mandate: to support (by presenting,
interpreting, collecting and preserving) the media arts of our time.
The new media arts community is shocked, outraged, frustrated,
appalled and disappointed. As Tate webcasting curator Honor Harger
has written, "the Walker's support of artists using technology over
the past 5 - 10 years has been highly significant in raising the
profile of new media art within cultural institutions around the
world. It is hard to imagine the new media art landscape without
Gallery 9."

It is not just Gallery 9 and the landmark digital arts study
collection Steve created our community fears losing. We fear for the
Walker's extensive expansion and the failed realization of the new
media galleries and flexible technological spaces which Steve helped
design. Moreover we fear for continuation of the new media
programming of other museums worldwide which followed Steve's lead
and were able to convince their board members, directors and funders
to support emerging media by holding up the (democratic, socially
engaged) example of the Walker. Steve's leadership in the field has
been one of the most progressive forces within the genre of new
media, one of the most rapidly developing fields of our time, and to
lose his example is nothing short of tragic.

We find it hard to imagine how Walker could feel confident proceeding
into the global age it so well expouses without Steve as part of its
team. (As Walker-commissioned artist Jon Winet wrote regarding your
staff layoffs, "we'd put Steve in the top seven most important staff
at the Walker, not number 140-147" - seven being the number of people
you've dismissed to balance your fy04 budget). His work consistently
demonstrated "a critical understanding of what a center for
contemporary art should be about", in the words of Berlin-based
curator Andreas Broeckmann. He is in his curating both "thoughtful
and conceptual, really taking what has happened online seriously, and
not just looking at technology or the browser. He even tried to build
some kind of historical knowledge about net art, a knowledge again
not based on the 'technological ethos' alone" writes Amsterdam-based
critic Josephine Bosma. Louisiana-based artist and curator Patrick
Lichty writes that if we are to take the "long view of new media as a
historical movement - an airplane which we're building while zipping
through the sky as we speak - to shape the construction of such an
undertaking, we need scholars, curators, writers, and artists." Steve
Dietz's role at Walker was fundamental to the construction of our
movement.

Whitney Museum new media curator Christiane Paul writes that, "we all
know that education and new media are the areas that usually
experience the most severe cuts in times of economic recession. What
is highly unusual, however, is that a museum or arts center would cut
the program that has established the institution as the leading one
in the whole country - which is what the new media initiatives
program at the Walker did, largely thanks to Steve Dietz. This cut
comes at a time when the rest of the world is gearing up its new
media efforts (and the US has been behind on that end in the first
place). If US institutions do not at least maintain the new media
initiatives they have built so far, they may have to spend millions
in the near future to catch up with the rest of the world."

We lament your decision and hope you are aware of what you have lost
and of the respect and support that Steve's work holds worldwide,
from artists and museum professionals alike. We urge you to act
responsibly towards Gallery 9, and to conserve and continue to
present both the digital arts study collection and the new media
projects which were commissioned by Walker during Steve's tenure.
They are an invaluable part of Walker's - and hence our community's -
collections and resources and history.

Sincerely yours,

Sarah Cook, former WAC intern, new media curator and co-editor, CRUMB

I was wondering if anybody out there shares my enthusiam for Vernon
Frazer's on-going opus, 'Improvisations' ?
To me it seems a 21st century 'alternative' masterpiece unfolding before
our eyes.
The work portrays an austere aura and drives one to delve deep into it
labrinthine context.
Drawing inspiration from the LANGUAGE, Projective and Beat 'Schools', it
appears Vernon has mined them of their treasure, transforming these finer
aspects to create a monument which I think will stand
amidst the greatest 'avant-garde' works of the 20th and 21st centuries.
I commend 'Muse Apprentice Guild', 'Sidereality',  'X-Stream' and 'Big
Bridge', among others, for having  the 'vision' to appreciate
'Improvisations'  inherent literary significance.
'It's got the Stuff' !
Onward and Upward Vernon !!!

What O'Hara said, in "Personism: A Manifesto," was, "And after all, only
Whitman and Crane and Williams, of the American poets, are better than the
movies."  However, I think there might be another famous quote, by O'Hara or
someone else, that we're conflating with this.  Can't quite put my finger on
it.

-- The ability to verify is the standard practice of science, or so I thought.
I'm borrwing this formula from Karl Popper which is no doubt dated.  He wrote that
in the thirties.  Since astrology doesn't make any sense within that framework,
it's toast.  At least in so far as science goes.  Phrenology, the same.  I don't
think that contemporary science would say that anything goes, but I'm not part of
that world.  Don't they have any standards either?  Not even the belief in
objective truth?  There used to be the four transcendentals -- truth, goodness,
beauty, and unity (I'm not sure about the fourth) laid out by Aristotle.  Now
they've all been junked in favor of immanence in most postmodern theory.  So
there's no absolutes any longer at least in postmodernism.  I thought they hold on
to objective truth in the scientific realm.  To get into scientific journals I
don't think you can propose astrology as a serious science.  Or phrenology.
Without offering proof that is verifiable.  I could be wrong. I don't know much
about that realm.

> really been dismissed?

-- By scientists, yes. Can you find a serious scientist (someone working in a
state university, for instance) who supports astrology?  I'd be amazed, but
wonders never cease.

>

> Has Latin?

-- This is different, isn't it.  Hard to put my finger on how it's different.  But
you have to know Latin in order to read 2000 years worth of history, theology,
etc.  So it has a value to historians.  A lot of good philosophy appears in Latin
until the 1800s.  I'm not sure if you see any qualitative difference between
phrenology and Latin as areas of inquiry.  Hard to put my finger on that.  Is this
relativism run amok, or are you playing devil's advocate?  My wheels spin!

> Rusing within nature?  Not sure what you mean, but that's probably my
> failing.  Getting a tad gooey about the mist an orange gives off (your
> example)--if that's "rusing," then I'm with you.

-- The term rusing comes from Lyotard.  It means to negotiate within any given
language game.  What's funny is that we have totally different languages and are
still trying to talk to each other.  I think I'm going to try and track down the
feller that quoted Tillich on another thread.  Could it be that there's another
Lutheran interested in poetry?  Track me down if there's another Lutheran anywhere
in this list.  I can't find a single American poet who was a practicing Lutheran.
Does anybody know of any?  There ought to have been some in Minnesota, but I don't
know of any.

History teaches us that the destruction of evil always leaves evil in charge.

-- You can't destroy evil.  It's a permanent part of the picture.  I think I agree
with you here but for totally different reasons.  It's funny that we can still
speak and agree even though we begin from totally different perspectives that
seemingly have no point of convergeance.  But now I'm getting a little bit
frustrated since we can't seem to agree on basic stuff like whether or not
anything exists, and if it does, whether it's communicable, and if it's
communicable, whether it's comprehensible, to go back to Gorgias and the sophists,
who posit that kind of position.

Yours truly,

-- Kirby O.

Colleagues:

I'd like to second Dale's words regarding Lee Chapman. Lee is a person whose editing ability,
insight and good taste is everywhere apparent in her magazine, First Intensity. If any of you have
need of the services of an editor or pre-press professional, you would be well advised to contact
her.

In addition, I'm sure that she could use a check for a subscription to First Intensity from each
person on this board. It must be obvious to every poet, writer, artist, editor, publisher and
academic here that without our day-in and day-out support, there can be no magazines, no locus of
discourse, no place of discovery and no pleasure for pleasure's sake.

(But let's not tell anyone in the current administration about that last one.)

This got spit out of my computer today when I wasn't looking. I am posting
it here, but don't ask me why.

Net Art is an illusion. There is no "network" out there. Only minds that
connect on a contingency basis. Promulgating a notion of network, let alone
any kind of interaction within same, is the new metaphysics. But then old
habits die hard, especially among those with visions and dreams that always
lie conveniently beyond the reach.

The "at least as good as" formulation probably goes back to Pound's
statement that poetry should be as least as good as prose.  Oppen, by the
way, torqued this to say poetry should be as least as good as silence.

Nothing is better than silence! It's what makes the words go round.

The quote queried about comes from Charles Bernstein:

(interviewer) In one of your essays you say that poetry should be at
least as interesting as television. How do you make it so?

(CB) That's a rewriting of a statement by Ezra Pound that said
"poetry should at least be as exciting as prose." Poetry, at its best, is
one of the richest kinds of artworks that's being done right now, in
terms of the scope of references and energy of the writing. It seems
to me that the only reason to do poetry is to make it more exciting
than what can be done in any other medium. If I was going to tell a
conventional story, why not do it as a film or television script? It can
compete best by doing things that the other commercially
constrained, narrative-driven media can't do. <...>


The above is from City Paper
(http://citypaper.net/articles/102397/20Q.Bernstein.shtml). Not sure
which essay is referenced. Flipped through the pieces I've read in
_Content's Dreams_ and didn't come across it.-----------------------------

Cranial


These texts are cranial; they spider google, collect/collapse, as if
google were the world-lightning of the net, those waveforms pointing to
convulsive solitons, moments of sudden and implicit revelation, turned out
matrices of phenomenal submergences. The world-lightning ruptures, creates
symptoms without direction, shadow-glows of truths close to toppling,
anything but absolute facticity. Furious cumulonimbus cauterizes any
conceivable functionality. You've got to understand the incomprehension of
the symbolic, and google is such evidence; the world temporarily gives
way, only to close again on confusion, cues and clues. Of this I haven't
learned but a name which collapses: "Alan Sondheim" or a new hiatus: "at",
"7" "au", "56" "br", "2" "ca", "19" "cc", "1" "com", "245" "de", "18"
"dk", "3" "edu", "139" "hu", "1" "ie", "1" "it", "1" "jp", "3" "net", "40"

Within the top thousand, a collection of domains centered on organization,

Here are some links to articles about Paris Connection (http://vispo.com/thefrenchartists ).
Think I probably posted an announcement when the project launched in Feb. 2003, but thought you
might want to check out some reviews and discussion of it.

Paris Connection focusses on the web.art being done in Paris by six artists: Jean-Jacques Birg,
Nicolas Clauss, Frdric Durieu, Jean-Luc Lamarque, Antoine Schmitt, and servovalve. Via
interviews, profiles and other writings, Paris Connection offers perspective on the artists
individually and as a loosely-knit group. It isn't a curation of their work; it's a project in
critical media about their work. Paris Connection features writing about their work by Helen
Thorington, Regina Clia Pinto, Roberto Simanowski, Carrie Noland, and me. It was co-published
and co-produced by four sites around the world: turbulence.org (New York); dichtung-digital.de
(Berlin); arteonline.arq.br (Rio); and coriolisweb.org (Toronto); it's presented in English,
French, Spanish, and Portuguese.

Poet Anne Waldman will read from her new book

DARK ARCANA / Afterimage or Glow
Photographs by Patti Smith

on Friday, May 30th from 5 to 7PM

at the Bowery Poetry Club (308 Bowery, NY, NY 10012) 212-614-0505

and YOU are invited to attend!  Admission is Free!

Cash bar and food is available.

Waldman's book will be for sale and she will sign copies. Taylor Mead will
follow her performance and he will make everybody scream with joy!


This is one of Waldman's most important poems; a feverish inspection of the
damage still being wrought by the Vietnam War on a society struggling to
preserve its unique culture and natural beauty. The photographs by Rock
icon, poet and photographer Patti Smith, which accompany the text, fit so
well, and accentuate the passionate ironies of the poem. She and husband
Oliver Ray had traveled extensively through Vietnam and captured some
extraordinary images. Waldman even dedicates the book to them.

Dark Arcana/Afterimage or Glow was the 2002 winner of the Heaven Bone Press
International Chapbook Competition. The work is contained in its entirety
within Waldman's forthcoming Iovis III: The Eternal War. This book is one o=
f
the first published glimpses into that eagerly anticipated third volume of
her 'magnum opus' Iovis.


Here's what Eleni Sikelianos wrote after she read Waldman's new book-length
poem:

=B3Dragon-like history=B2 rises up to haunt us again, and, as we have learned
from our =B3appointment[s] with calamity,=B2 the war is never over.  Once again
our worrier/warrior-of-words, keen-eyed observer Commandante Waldman leads
us into the fray through the =B3stench of colonialism,=B2 through the dark
=B3fruit of our destiny,=B2 and right into battle =8B the battle to win back the
world.




=8BEleni Sikelianos




and Alan Gilbert had to say:

Vietnam is not a ghost. And it's not a movie, either. Rather, Vietnam has
left an imprint on history that even the most overweening empires will neve=
r
be able to efface. In Dark Arcana/Afterimage or Glow, nomadic poet and
scholar Anne Waldman finds traces of these imprints in the fragments of
war's memory, both personal and shared. =B3What is it like to be colonial?=B2
Waldman asks. The colonial can never know itself. But at its edges, past it=
s
=B3afterimage or glow,=B2 understanding and knowledge are wrestled from ruin.

Dark Arcana/Afterimage or Glow is available for $12.95 (plus $1.00 Shipping
and Handling) by order direct from Heaven Bone Press (P.O. Box 486, Chester=
,
NY 10918) Wholesale and bookstore inquiries welcome.

-- The ability to verify is the standard practice of science, or so I thought.
I'm borrwing this formula from Karl Popper which is no doubt dated.  He wrote
that
in the thirties.  Since astrology doesn't make any sense within that
framework,
it's toast.  At least in so far as science goes.  Phrenology, the same.  I
don't
think that contemporary science would say that anything goes, but I'm not
part of
that world.  Don't they have any standards either?  Not even the belief in
objective truth?  There used to be the four transcendentals -- truth,
goodness,
beauty, and unity (I'm not sure about the fourth) laid out by Aristotle.  Now
they've all been junked in favor of immanence in most postmodern theory.  So
there's no absolutes any longer at least in postmodernism.  I thought they
hold on
to objective truth in the scientific realm.  To get into scientific journals I
don't think you can propose astrology as a serious science.  Or phrenology.
Without offering proof that is verifiable.  I could be wrong. I don't know
much
about that realm.

-- By scientists, yes. Can you find a serious scientist (someone working in a
state university, for instance) who supports astrology?  I'd be amazed, but
wonders never cease.

>

> Has Latin?

-- This is different, isn't it.  Hard to put my finger on how it's different.
 But
you have to know Latin in order to read 2000 years worth of history, theology,
etc.  So it has a value to historians.  A lot of good philosophy appears in
Latin
until the 1800s.  I'm not sure if you see any qualitative difference between
phrenology and Latin as areas of inquiry.  Hard to put my finger on that.  Is
this
relativism run amok, or are you playing devil's advocate?  My wheels spin!

> Rusing within nature?  Not sure what you mean, but that's probably my
> failing.  Getting a tad gooey about the mist an orange gives off (your

-- The term rusing comes from Lyotard.  It means to negotiate within any given
language game.  What's funny is that we have totally different languages and
are
still trying to talk to each other.  I think I'm going to try and track down
the
feller that quoted Tillich on another thread.  Could it be that there's
another
Lutheran interested in poetry?  Track me down if there's another Lutheran
anywhere
in this list.  I can't find a single American poet who was a practicing
Lutheran.
Does anybody know of any?  There ought to have been some in Minnesota, but I
don't
know of any.

History teaches us that the destruction of evil always leaves evil in charge.

-- You can't destroy evil.  It's a permanent part of the picture.  I think I
agree
with you here but for totally different reasons.  It's funny that we can still
speak and agree even though we begin from totally different perspectives that
seemingly have no point of convergeance.  But now I'm getting a little bit
frustrated since we can't seem to agree on basic stuff like whether or not
anything exists, and if it does, whether it's communicable, and if it's
communicable, whether it's comprehensible, to go back to Gorgias and the
sophists,
who posit that kind of position.

Yours truly,

-- Kirby O. >>

Kirby,

Have a great trip!  I'm heading to Spain.  Like you, I'm a tad worn out,
though obviously I love this stuff.  So one more push.

We do converge, here and there.  That's unavoidable, I think.  It's just that
what you seem to accept as absolute, sort of, I comprehend as provisional at
best.  Perhaps (perhaps not) you're more at ease with the positivist's view of
a fairly stable universe whose laws are available to us as they "really" are,
independent of us.  This, of course, signals a crucial difference between
positivism and quantum interrogation.  Whether or not something is verifiable
matters in both cases.  However, the positivists tend to accept what is verified
as some object out there without us.  I'm saying, along with quantum
scientists, that what is out there is mediated by the tools (e.g., cyclotrons, or the
subject created by language) we use to "discover" it, to verify it.

But consider that science has been "rewritten" many times.  Newton was
corrected by Einstein; and the quantum guys have given us a strong dose of
indeterminacy which has been verified as much as anything can be, via laboratory
testing.  So we shouldn't be surprised that our assumptions, our world views--yours
and mine--aren't as reliable as we'd like to think.  Sorry to frustrate you.
I understand, and respect, how and why you feel that way.  It may be that your
basic assumptions are not mine.  That's why we are having this extended
conversation.  I, for one, have enjoyed it.  I could spend this time with those who
agree with me, but that wouldn't be so interesting.  If the point is for one
of us to convince the other, well, that probably won't happen.  I never
expected it to happen.  For me the sharing of ideas is enough.

As for astrology--I make no claim for the current empirical viability of
astrology as serious science.  I completely agree with how you put it:  that
within a certain framework, astrology is toast.  (On the other hand cause and
effect is likewise suspect, at least according to David Hume.  And his framework is
pretty compelling.)  I am saying that whichever view of the universe
currently obtains, it carries within it, as a necessary aspect of its definition, its
contraries.  For example, the Copernican universe makes sense to us as an idea
largely because it does not "dismiss" the Ptolemaic one, in the sense of
banishing it from our science.  If the Ptolemaic view were completely undone, we
wouldn't learn about it, know about it.  It is still there as an idea helping
to make sense of the Copernican view, part of the "rightness" of the Copernican
view.  So "wrong ideas" are not so much dismissed as repressed, so to speak.
Both views continue "in play."  And it sometimes happens that privilege is
reversed, wrong becomes right, right becomes wrong.  The speed of light, for
example--long held to be constant by all serious scientists--maybe ain't
according to the latest findings.

I am certainly not promoting relativism, or sophistry.  Nor am I promoting
absolutism.  Not anymore than a scientist who explains that the chair you are
sitting on is not actually solid--that it is made of atoms which are 99% space,
and the reason you don't fall through it is that electromagnetic forces repel
each other and provide the "illusion" of solidity--is telling you to always
stand.  The chair bit is basic science.  It's explanation, not promotion.  I
never said you shouldn't sit on the chair.  We do tend to "gravitate" (a little
Newton here) toward what makes us comfortable.  From one point of view there
certainly exists the solid chair.  The "fact" is that our world is created and
contained by different points of view.  This also is scientifically verifiable.
 The absolute is always very much with us as an idea.  Relativism (at least
the radical kind--there is more than one kind) "dismisses" hierarchies within
its theoretical framework.  What I'm doing, in part, is explaining how and why
they can never be dismissed.  They are inevitable.  Language guarantees that.

If it seems to you that I'm going in circles, you might appreciate the
process.  The circle is a traditional symbol for godhead, eternity, etc.  The circle
has no beginning and no end.  It surely suggests the frustration inherent in
linear thinking, in any search for a final cause (Aristotle), for an absolute
free of its existence as idea, for god at the end of the rainbow.  Even
traditional views of god assume that he is without beginning, without end, i.e.,
beyond our comprehension, beyond objectivity and subjectivity.  One cannot
arrive, finally, at god since god does not occupy a position of finality.  Placing
god outside of the circle where he may ultimately be reached makes no sense
since that positions god outside of himself.  If that doesn't spin some heads, I
don't know what will.  (Of course it is always more comfortable not to ask too
many questions, to just sit on the chair and shut up.)  I'm just pointing out
what traditional religion conceals within its dogma.  The contradiction
within religion (within any notion of an absolute) is, of course, necessary to the
existence, and persuasiveness, of the teaching.  Without the idea of god as
circle, man would just be pursuing himself (which may be what he is doing
anyway), i.e., a creature with a beginning and an end.  Without the idea of a god
who occupies no end and is therefore unreachable (whose position is
indeterminate), our idea of a transcendent
god/absolute/source/creator/origin/self-identity as someone/something to arrive at, to find, to know would not exist for us.
One idea lives within the other, depends on the other, makes possible the
other.

I appreciate your refreshing my memory re:  Lyotard.  It IS interesting that
we agree on some things while working from different perspectives.  That's a
big part of the fun as far as I'm concerned, along with the obvious that you're
very well read.  Thanks mucho for the give and take.

Best always, Bill

There's an ad running for this new rollercoaster called "Zonga" at a Bay
Area amusement park, in which the voice-over guy says,
"In Swahili, 'zonga' means 'twisted.' "
Can anyone on the list verify whether this is true? Thanks, I'm all ears LRSN

Ha! Thank you, Eileen, this is great. So "zonga" is the infinitive, & not
passive participle? Interesting how the passive verb doesn't appear to mean
"to be twisted" but "to have things twisted/wound around one." Those
rollercoaster maniacs LRSN

Sex life should be at least as consistent as sleeping life.

Work should be at least as satisfying as pain.

Thought should be at least as persistent as money

Money should be at least as idiotic as Spring.

Love should be at least as enlightening as waking life.

Ezra Pound should be at least as unrelenting as Frank O'Hara.

Poetry should be at least as crazy as economic regression formulas.

Life should be at least as  interesting as death.

Conversely, prose should be as well written as poetry.  Just pound on
its head.

Bill, I'm camping, but it's so cold we're inside the ranger's cabin.  No mosquitoes because they can't fly if it's under 60, but
the legs are cold.

Happy trip to Spain!

I can't really say anything much because I haven't read quantum theory so I give up at this point until I get a chance, but
since my only interest is in aesthetics at this point I probably won't get to it this summer.  But didn't Einstein say that a
theory had to be elegant, had to be, or else it couldn't be true?  Also, didn't he say that God didn't play at dice, or
something.

I suppose there are some scientists who think the universe is butt-ugly these days.  Glad to have made you gooey with the mist
from oranges!  I saw a blue indigo bird today.  Also butterflies.  There was a partial rainbow.  Thought of you, but no new
arguments.  Ok, I asked the ranger if I could borrow his computer for a few minutes and now had better get back to camping.
What book should I read to brush up on quantum theory and all that for beginners?

Hi Kirby!  I also get off on camping, believe it or not.  Nothing like the
smell of breakfast floating into the tent.  Try Brian Greene's The Elegant
Universe (speaking of Einstein).  It's a good layman's read.

Yes, Einstein did say that god doesn't play dice with the universe.  God
plays monopoly.  Just kidding.  Enjoy your time away from time!  Best always, Bill

There is an exhibit by the modernist woodworker Wharton Esherick at
SOFA. If you don't know the guy's work, I heartily recommend it. His
home here in Paoli(now a tiny museum on a very out-of-the-way road up
the mountain behind Valley Forge) is a revelation to visit -- from the
near-total absence of right angles in its architecture to the furniture
made out of recycled hammer handles to the giant sculpture "pit" or
studio to the bed literally atop a filing cabinet for his drawings to
the use of a mastodon tusk for a banister up the spiral staircase. It's
a view into the modernism of the likes of Marsden Hartley et al that
will open your senses & deepen your historical understanding.

There is a good article on Esherick in today's Inky:

http://www.philly.com/mld/inquirer/5924889.htm

The SOFA show (for Sculpture Objects & Functional Art) will run from
Thursday through June 1 at the Seventh Regiment Armory, Park Avenue and
67th Street, New York. Tickets: $16; 1-800-563-7632

http://www.sofaexpo.com

Robert Aibel will speak at noon next Friday on "Aesthetics in the Work
of Wharton Esherick: From Cubism to Organic Design."

Moderne Gallery, 111 N. Third St., Philadelphia, will present "Masters
of the American Craft and Studio Furniture Movement: 1922-1988" from
June 10 to Aug. 9, including works by Esherick, George Nakashima,
Wendell Castle, and Sam Maloof; 215-923-8536

The Wharton Esherick Museum in Paoli is open by reservation only, $9
admission, $4 children under 12; 610-644-5822.

NOMADS + RESIDENTS at White Box
Friday, May 23rd, 7:00 PM

"Inappropriate Adjustments"

Nomads & Residents invites you to an evening of presentations by, Nina Katchadourian, Zlatko Kopljar, Nebojsa Seric - Shoba and Heidie Giannotti.

This session will bring together four artists from two highly different settings, the US and the Balkans, who are separately working with their existing social, ethical and natural limits of the world they take as their own. No matter whether their practice is triggered by the extremes and by the absurdities of this world, of war, of hermetic institutionalism, of urban ecology, or of nature and constructed nature, their work may tell of a certain inappropriate act of adjusting both the reality and to reality.

PUZZLE PARADE "UNDER CONSTRUCTION"

>From Monday May 27th come to White Box and view Puzzle Parade through the window as it materializes.

Puzzle Parade is an oversized, immense site-specific painting generated by a collective of five New Formalist Danish painters.  Over the course of five days - from May 25 to May 29 - and open to daily public scrutiny, the selected artists will complete a puzzle.  In this Puzzle Parade, each player works within a particular block of space while collectively sharing the larger terrain. According to the agreed game rules, they will tip off, tackle, guard, box out and switch their counter pictorial markings in the pursuit of creating a crooked, humorous and surprising set of abstract stories. The entire exercise provides viewers with a close encounter of how painting moves into the realm of performance, sculpture and installation.

Puzzle Parade opens Thursday, May 29, 2003 6 - 8 pm

Bill

as you know i agree strongly with your need to bring in the issue of
verification here.  It's a good word for evoking the intractability of the
problem.  The problem being whether language diverges from "reality" or is
its own reality.

As for astrology, since it lacks inductive power and is not falsifiable in
the least, I can hardly find anyone serious about science to include it in
the science realm.  However, conversely, I'd say much of what we call
"science" today is not very different from astrology.

samuel delany's _Nova_ (at least I think it was Nova) is set in the future
with a human society that is post-science.  In this book, humans have
already realized that the scientific method was just a convoluted mechanism
for projecting a person's will onto nature and reimagining it.  in this
society, the tarot becomes the divining rod of humans, because of the
tarot's ability to elicit complex, creative, and personal insights from its
readers.  A sort of tool useful for leveraging the unconscious and all its
myriad connections to things well beyond the capacity of consciousness.  the
tarot then taps into this will behind science to project one's will onto
present and future reality.  it's a fairly interesting and insightful take
on science.  science is realized as an elaborate scheme for extending one's
will upon the universe, documented entirely in one's personal perceptual and
linguistic categories.  we *make* the world just as we observe it, and
insodoing we make ourselves.

Paul Feyerabend was able to point out a complimentary problem (complimentary
to the contemporary problem of the general human ignorance of the projective
aspects of the scientific method) with contemporary science--it's become a
religion.  To Feyerabend, 17th and 18th century science was an instrument of
liberation and enlightenment.  It encouraged man to question inherited
beliefs.  Feyerabend felt that modern science has deteriorated into a
"stupid religion."  His reasons?  1. Scientific "facts" are taught at a very
early age, in the same way religious "facts" were taught a century ago.  2.
Science doesn't receive the criticism that society gets even at elementary
level.  3.  The judgement of scientists is received in much the same way as
the judgments of the bishop and cardinal were accepted.  4.  Science has
become as oppressive as the ideologies it once had to fight.  5.  Heretics
in science are sanctioned.

One of Feyerabend's solutions for this was to encourage the separation of
science and religion.   I worked as a researcher for the NIH for a few
years, and lemme tell you, Feyerabend's analysis is right-on.  It explains
about 95% of the reasons I ultimately abandoned a career in cancer research.
I would add that the religiosity of science, at least when it comes to
cancer research, is at least in part a consequence of economics.  Too much
money to be made from millions dying from cancer and long, drawn-out
treatments that at best offer only remission.  Cancer research is more of a
power pyramid for the researchers and oncologists than a raft of pioneers
searching along the banks of knowledge.

Now for Feyerabend, the power structure and power-gesturing of scientific
authorities is perhaps best embodied by self-appointed
scientist-"debunkers."  Like the folks that write for the "Skeptical
Enquirer."  You know the type, the scientists who come out of the woodwork
to name Wilhelm Reich the quack of the century for Time magazine while
failing to explain exactly why Reich was wrong, or what's worse, why he
deserves to be called a "quack."  Bravely fighting pseud-science =
brandishing weighty authoritave rhetorics.

Feyerabend wrote:

"Modern astrology is in many respects similar to early mediaeval astronomy:
it inherited interesting and profound ideas, but it distorted them, and
replaced them by caricatures more adapted to the limited understanding of
its practitioners. The caricatures are not used for research; there is no
attempt to proceed into new domains and to enlarge our knowledge of
extra-terrestrial influences; they simply serve as a reservoir of naive
rules and phrases suited to impress the ignorant. Yet this is not the
objection raised by our scientists. They do not criticize the air of
stagnation that has been permitted to obscure the basic assumptions of
astrology, they criticize these basic assumptions themselves and in the
process turn their own subjects into caricatures. It is interesting to see
how closely both parties approach in other in ignorance, conceit and the
wish for easy power over minds."

Astrology seems, then, to employ many of the beliefs that its
scientific-debunker-crtitics use for their own basis of critique.  It is
becoming harder and harder to honestly distinguish between such
religious-ish systems as astrology and the science practiced by astrology's
scientist-critics.  Far be it from a scientist-critic to actually
investigate the possibility of the influence of planets and stars on the
behavior of humans.  Instead astrologers are just swept under the rug with
cheap "first assumption" critiques from scientists, critiques loaded with
authoritative language-gesturing.  Any freshman university philosophy
student can attack first assumptions....

I'm borrwing this formula from Karl Popper which is no doubt dated.  He
wrote
that
in the thirties.  Since astrology doesn't make any sense within that
framework,
it's toast.  At least in so far as science goes.  Phrenology, the same.  I
don't
think that contemporary science would say that anything goes, but I'm not
part of
that world.  Don't they have any standards either?  Not even the belief in
objective truth?  There used to be the four transcendentals -- truth,
goodness,
beauty, and unity (I'm not sure about the fourth) laid out by Aristotle.
Now
they've all been junked in favor of immanence in most postmodern theory.  So
there's no absolutes any longer at least in postmodernism.  I thought they
hold on
to objective truth in the scientific realm.  To get into scientific journals
I
don't think you can propose astrology as a serious science.  Or phrenology.
Without offering proof that is verifiable.  I could be wrong. I don't know
much
about that realm.

-- By scientists, yes. Can you find a serious scientist (someone working in
a
state university, for instance) who supports astrology?  I'd be amazed, but
wonders never cease.

 But
you have to know Latin in order to read 2000 years worth of history,
theology,
etc.  So it has a value to historians.  A lot of good philosophy appears in
Latin
until the 1800s.  I'm not sure if you see any qualitative difference between
phrenology and Latin as areas of inquiry.  Hard to put my finger on that.
Is
this
relativism run amok, or are you playing devil's advocate?  My wheels spin!

> Rusing within nature?  Not sure what you mean, but that's probably my

-- The term rusing comes from Lyotard.  It means to negotiate within any
given
language game.  What's funny is that we have totally different languages and
are
still trying to talk to each other.  I think I'm going to try and track down
the
feller that quoted Tillich on another thread.  Could it be that there's
another
Lutheran interested in poetry?  Track me down if there's another Lutheran
anywhere
in this list.  I can't find a single American poet who was a practicing
Lutheran.
Does anybody know of any?  There ought to have been some in Minnesota, but I
don't
know of any.

History teaches us that the destruction of evil always leaves evil in
charge.

-- You can't destroy evil.  It's a permanent part of the picture.  I think I
agree
with you here but for totally different reasons.  It's funny that we can
still
speak and agree even though we begin from totally different perspectives
that
seemingly have no point of convergeance.  But now I'm getting a little bit
frustrated since we can't seem to agree on basic stuff like whether or not
anything exists, and if it does, whether it's communicable, and if it's
communicable, whether it's comprehensible, to go back to Gorgias and the
sophists,
who posit that kind of position.

Yours truly,

-- Kirby O. >>

Kirby,

Have a great trip!  I'm heading to Spain.  Like you, I'm a tad worn out,
though obviously I love this stuff.  So one more push.

We do converge, here and there.  That's unavoidable, I think.  It's just
that
what you seem to accept as absolute, sort of, I comprehend as provisional at
best.  Perhaps (perhaps not) you're more at ease with the positivist's view
of
a fairly stable universe whose laws are available to us as they "really"
are,
independent of us.  This, of course, signals a crucial difference between
positivism and quantum interrogation.  Whether or not something is
verifiable
matters in both cases.  However, the positivists tend to accept what is
verified
as some object out there without us.  I'm saying, along with quantum
scientists, that what is out there is mediated by the tools (e.g.,
cyclotrons, or the
subject created by language) we use to "discover" it, to verify it.

But consider that science has been "rewritten" many times.  Newton was
corrected by Einstein; and the quantum guys have given us a strong dose of
indeterminacy which has been verified as much as anything can be, via
laboratory
testing.  So we shouldn't be surprised that our assumptions, our world
views--yours
and mine--aren't as reliable as we'd like to think.  Sorry to frustrate you.
I understand, and respect, how and why you feel that way.  It may be that
your
basic assumptions are not mine.  That's why we are having this extended
conversation.  I, for one, have enjoyed it.  I could spend this time with
those who
agree with me, but that wouldn't be so interesting.  If the point is for one
of us to convince the other, well, that probably won't happen.  I never
expected it to happen.  For me the sharing of ideas is enough.

As for astrology--I make no claim for the current empirical viability of
astrology as serious science.  I completely agree with how you put it:  that
within a certain framework, astrology is toast.  (On the other hand cause
and
effect is likewise suspect, at least according to David Hume.  And his
framework is
pretty compelling.)  I am saying that whichever view of the universe
currently obtains, it carries within it, as a necessary aspect of its
definition, its
contraries.  For example, the Copernican universe makes sense to us as an
idea
largely because it does not "dismiss" the Ptolemaic one, in the sense of
banishing it from our science.  If the Ptolemaic view were completely
undone, we
wouldn't learn about it, know about it.  It is still there as an idea
helping
to make sense of the Copernican view, part of the "rightness" of the
Copernican
view.  So "wrong ideas" are not so much dismissed as repressed, so to speak.
Both views continue "in play."  And it sometimes happens that privilege is
reversed, wrong becomes right, right becomes wrong.  The speed of light, for
example--long held to be constant by all serious scientists--maybe ain't
according to the latest findings.

I am certainly not promoting relativism, or sophistry.  Nor am I promoting
absolutism.  Not anymore than a scientist who explains that the chair you
are
sitting on is not actually solid--that it is made of atoms which are 99%
space,
and the reason you don't fall through it is that electromagnetic forces
repel
each other and provide the "illusion" of solidity--is telling you to always
stand.  The chair bit is basic science.  It's explanation, not promotion.  I
never said you shouldn't sit on the chair.  We do tend to "gravitate" (a
little
Newton here) toward what makes us comfortable.  From one point of view there
certainly exists the solid chair.  The "fact" is that our world is created
and
contained by different points of view.  This also is scientifically
verifiable.
 The absolute is always very much with us as an idea.  Relativism (at least
the radical kind--there is more than one kind) "dismisses" hierarchies
within
its theoretical framework.  What I'm doing, in part, is explaining how and
why
they can never be dismissed.  They are inevitable.  Language guarantees
that.

If it seems to you that I'm going in circles, you might appreciate the
process.  The circle is a traditional symbol for godhead, eternity, etc.
The circle
has no beginning and no end.  It surely suggests the frustration inherent in
linear thinking, in any search for a final cause (Aristotle), for an
absolute
free of its existence as idea, for god at the end of the rainbow.  Even
traditional views of god assume that he is without beginning, without end,
i.e.,
beyond our comprehension, beyond objectivity and subjectivity.  One cannot
arrive, finally, at god since god does not occupy a position of finality.
Placing
god outside of the circle where he may ultimately be reached makes no sense
since that positions god outside of himself.  If that doesn't spin some
heads, I
don't know what will.  (Of course it is always more comfortable not to ask
too
many questions, to just sit on the chair and shut up.)  I'm just pointing
out
what traditional religion conceals within its dogma.  The contradiction
within religion (within any notion of an absolute) is, of course, necessary
to the
existence, and persuasiveness, of the teaching.  Without the idea of god as
circle, man would just be pursuing himself (which may be what he is doing
anyway), i.e., a creature with a beginning and an end.  Without the idea of
a god
who occupies no end and is therefore unreachable (whose position is
indeterminate), our idea of a transcendent
god/absolute/source/creator/origin/self-identity as someone/something to
arrive at, to find, to know would not exist for us.
One idea lives within the other, depends on the other, makes possible the
other.

I appreciate your refreshing my memory re:  Lyotard.  It IS interesting that
we agree on some things while working from different perspectives.  That's a
big part of the fun as far as I'm concerned, along with the obvious that
you're
very well read.  Thanks mucho for the give and take.

Best always, Bill

poets Mark Salerno and Keith Wilson
Saturday, May 24, 7pm

Admission: $5; Students $3

Mark Salerno was born in New York in 1956. He lives in Hollywood, where he
edits Arshile: A Magazine of the Arts. His books of poetry include Hate (96
Tears Press, Los Angeles 1995) and Method (The Figures, Great Barrington, MA
2002). The poet C.D. Wright says of the poetry in Method:

"If these pieces / glimpses / points in review could be molded into popular
songs (happily they resist) I'd buy every cd. Method is a spoken nightscape,
a starry, commiserating agent between Bronk and Creeley, a dry-eyed
testimonial of ambivalent standing between our incurable existential
awareness and bottomless communal longing. Salerno puts a clearheaded list
of key words in circulation and returns to us a plenary of mostly
single-sentence poems, a calvacade of impeccably broken lines, not
forgetting the invisible crack in everything. What little caviling goes on
is directed at the poet acaviling. He is, in all modesty and honesty, "just
doing his job"insuring that what we really think, and what we actually say,
is a tight fit."


Keith Wilson, professor emeritus and former New Mexico State University
poet-in-residence, was born on the Llano Estacado. He grew up in Fort
Sumner, Deming, Carlsbad, Alamogordo, Portland, Ore., and Albuquerque. He
graduated from the U.S. Naval Academy and the University of New  Mexico. He
is the author of more than twenty-five books of poetry including Midwatch,
When Dancing Feet Shatter the Earth, Stone Roses, Lions Gate, Graves
Registry, and Homestead. Wilson has received a Lifetime Achievement Award
from the Border Book Festival, a National Endowment of the Arts Creative
Writing Fellowship, a D.H. Lawrence Creative Fellowship, a Senior
Fulbright-Hayes Fellowship, a P.E.N. America Writing Grant, the New Mexico
Governors Award for Excellence and Achievement in Literature, and New
Mexico State Universitys Westhafer Award.  His most recent book,
Transcendental Studies, published by Tucsons Chax Press, will be available
to the public for the first time at this reading.  Robert Creeley writes of
this book

"This dear book is fact of a long practised care and the wisdom which at
last lets it go. Here are poems as intimate as breathing, recognitions quick
as a lizards moving in the sudden sun. Back of it all is the abiding love
for those ones lived a life with. May this circle forever be unbroken."

Subject:      gravity's elbow (language and world)
In-Reply-To:  <179.1ac077c6.2bffe7a5@aol.com>
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII

Every now and then this "language and world" thread comes around and I
always find myself tempted to try to say something about it (I haven't
seen everything that's been said this time around, but I'm thinking
particularly of the recent provocative exchange under the title "Astrology
and Science").  It seems to me that the fact that we shape our world
through language is indisputable, but it also seems to me that the matter
(have to get this pun out of my system at some point) becomes trickier
when we start trying to think about whether anything external to us exists
at all.  Quantum physics often pops up, as it has here, as a reminder that
the presence of the observer fundamentally influences, or even
constitutes, whatever we might want to call "reality."  And, of course,
there's also the question of perception itself, and the way our sensory
apparatus constructs our experience.  Linguistics, physics, biology-work
in all these disciplines (leaving out others, like philosophy) confronts
us with the constructed, the partial, the relative.  So why do I still
find myself resisting the strongest formulations of what I'll call by way
of shorthand the "languaged" view of reality?  I guess some part of me
still gets a charge out of Berkeley kicking that stone and saying to the
radical skeptic "I refute thee thus."  Of course the stone could be an
illusion:  B. could be floating in a pod in the matrix dreaming both
stones and kicks.  Nevertheless his body would be there, and if the AI's
wanted to keep him alive it would have to make concessions to that body's
biology, making sure it was fed (if only by that black soup simmered from
bodies of dead humans), and so on.  If be were dreaming an illusion, it
still wouldn't be an illusion with no rules, coming out of nowhere (how
did he come to dream about stones, not to mention legs and feet in the
first place?)  We are embodied, our intelligence is embodied, our brains
are embodied, and yes, this embodiment means that we construct the world
in a particular way.  But it also means that the world constructs us.
That our bodies (and so our intelligence, our language) have evolved under
particular conditions and constraints not of our making.  What are these
"conditions and constraints" if not external reality?

Immediately, I want to qualify my position by pointing out that the
scenario I've just described, or perhaps it's better to say my description
of it, is flawed in its reliance on a too crude opposition between "self"
and "external reality," "us" and "out there."  To be sure, observer and
world are looped in the most complex fashion.  But the exaggeration is
necessary, perhaps, to remind us that we are "formed" by the world even as
we also "form" it.   Hayles's book on the posthuman, which I was reading
not too long ago, gives an interesting account of the role the frog brain
played in Maturana and Varela's formulation of autopoietic theory, which
Hayles describes as an "epistemological revolution" precisely because of
the crucial role it gives to the "observer."  After studying froggie
perception in detail, and modeling the circuitry of the frog visual
system, M and V were able to see exactly how the frog brain constructed
its world, that frog's were constructed to see small, fast-moving objects
(like flies-for-dinner) but not large slow-moving objects (like Chilean
biologists).  And, of course, we humans perform the same sort of
perceptual and cognitive tricks when "look" and "listen" and "feel" and
"smell" and "think."  But we wouldn't do any of it the same way if we
started with different givens, if we (but who would "we" be?) had managed
somehow to evolve on Mars, say, rather than on Earth.   Around the time of
that Social Text hoax scandal with the physicist who wrote the essay full
of made-up pomo science, I remember scientists cracking jokes about pomo
theorists falling out of windows and not be able to talk their way out of
gravity, and I thought the scientists had a pretty good point (even as I
also think that science is a culturally and historically and economically
constructed enterprise, and that the ideal of "objectivity" is often just
a crock).

So there's gravity, as an example of those conditions and constraints I
mentioned before, and it happens to be a whole lot more "pressing" on
Earth than on Mars, and our bodies, including eyes, ears, hands, lips,
tongues, larynxes, brains, have evolved accordingly.  Interesting, too, to
think about how morphology, the shape of things, inflects any force or law
we can imagine, including gravity itself, so that gravity on Earth is far
from constant, despite the "mean" figure one can pluck from a chart (32
feet per second per second), depending on such factors as: the centrifugal
force due to the Earth's rotation; elevation on the earth's surface; tidal
variations (which depend on the movements of sun and moon, and which
therefore introduce time into the equation); and underground densities.
So, yes, the cosmos itself is embodied; it exists whether or not I think
it exists (though who knows, it may exist in a different way depending on
what I decide!).  And when we posit a world made entirely of and by
language we may be performing something like the kind of operation we
carry out when we imagine ideal mathematical worlds.  So the
"constructivist" approach that seems to start out from such historicist,
relativist premises can end up becoming a kind of idealism?  Hmmm,
interesting, and that seems to be where I'm ending up for now, since it's
time to go feed the baby (and I'm pretty sure he does exist, with his
pre-languaged needs and desires, like hunger).

For me at least, all this has implications of poetry, but I've run out of
steam, so I won't try to go into them here.  I have worked intermittently
on a series of poems under the title IN/SIDE/OUT, a title intended to
suggest something about the complexities of internal/external relations.

This time around this discussion I'm stuck on the question why poets feel
the need to appeal to philosophy and/or physics to support 'visions' of
reality?

Although currently under some psychological 'fire' as you note (perhaps
inadvertently, Steve) constructivist psychology may offer a glimmer here.

Enjoy--

Also, summer reading

Vas: by Steve Tomasula
is an amazing combo of art / vispo / comic book materials thrown
together under the old Flatliner theme of geometry. We passed this book
to station hill & they did a gorgeous production of a brilliant book.

MS: by Mike Magee
it is the use of rhythm that moves the ms. & the black Irish poem is
held in high esteem by 4 out of 5 interns. Hottest book of the summer.
Beware: cover causes eyestrain.

>  25. BEI DAO

I am only now getting to some back numbers of the list
& see a query regarding New Directions' decision to
use "traditional" rather than "simplified" characters
for the en face of a volume of Bei Dao's poems.  The
writer seemed to think this was a political gesture,
inclining towards Taiwan/HK and against PRC.  But the
difference between the orthographies is not a simple
political issue.  In my experience, most literate
Chinese can handle both simplified and complex forms
of characters.  There are plenty of books published in
the PRC using traditional/complex forms of characters
-- they tend to be history, classical literature,
philosophy, etc, from the pre-modern period.  When I
started learning to read Chinese myself, back in the
late Ming dynasty, my Chinese friends always told me
that the complex forms looked better, more elegant,
but that for writing it was better to use the
simplified forms.  In fact, the simplified forms were
mostly in common use in writing before the communists
imposed them on everything.  so if anything, Bei Dao
having en face text in fanti zi rather than jianhua zi
is probably to make it look classier, fancier, more
upscale, like printing a menu in French.
But I have no idea what New Directions was thinking.
Ask Elliot Weinberger.
Also, if you are learning Chinese to read Bei Dao
that's great, but you have a big treat ahead  since
the 19 Old Poems or Ruan Ji or Du Fu or Ouyang Xiu or
Lu You or lots of others will also be accessible to
you and that is really amazing writing.
As for Bei Dao being the airport/translatorese Chinese
poet, what's wrong with that?  the echoes between
Chinese and Anglo/Franco literary traditions are
immense resounding back and forth.  Who slams P.
Auster or E. Hemingway for writing in special English?
These are my opinions for today.

Whether external reality exists or not, what seems important to me is
that we _understand_ the world through language -- we make meaning
through language.  Let's just pretend for a second that a piece of
visual art exists.  Visual art is no less reality because it (usually)
denies language; but how we make meaning from a piece of visual art is
through language.

Subject: gravity's elbow (language and world)

Every now and then this "language and world" thread comes around and I
always find myself tempted to try to say something about it (I haven't
seen everything that's been said this time around, but I'm thinking
particularly of the recent provocative exchange under the title
"Astrology
and Science").  It seems to me that the fact that we shape our world
through language is indisputable, but it also seems to me that the
matter
(have to get this pun out of my system at some point) becomes trickier
when we start trying to think about whether anything external to us
exists
at all.  Quantum physics often pops up, as it has here, as a reminder
that
the presence of the observer fundamentally influences, or even
constitutes, whatever we might want to call "reality."  And, of course,
there's also the question of perception itself, and the way our sensory
apparatus constructs our experience.  Linguistics, physics, biology-work
in all these disciplines (leaving out others, like philosophy) confronts
us with the constructed, the partial, the relative.  So why do I still
find myself resisting the strongest formulations of what I'll call by
way
of shorthand the "languaged" view of reality?  I guess some part of me
still gets a charge out of Berkeley kicking that stone and saying to the
radical skeptic "I refute thee thus."  Of course the stone could be an
illusion:  B. could be floating in a pod in the matrix dreaming both
stones and kicks.  Nevertheless his body would be there, and if the AI's
wanted to keep him alive it would have to make concessions to that
body's
biology, making sure it was fed (if only by that black soup simmered
from
bodies of dead humans), and so on.  If be were dreaming an illusion, it
still wouldn't be an illusion with no rules, coming out of nowhere (how
did he come to dream about stones, not to mention legs and feet in the
first place?)  We are embodied, our intelligence is embodied, our brains
are embodied, and yes, this embodiment means that we construct the world
in a particular way.  But it also means that the world constructs us.
That our bodies (and so our intelligence, our language) have evolved
under
particular conditions and constraints not of our making.  What are these
"conditions and constraints" if not external reality?

Immediately, I want to qualify my position by pointing out that the
scenario I've just described, or perhaps it's better to say my
description
of it, is flawed in its reliance on a too crude opposition between
"self"
and "external reality," "us" and "out there."  To be sure, observer and
world are looped in the most complex fashion.  But the exaggeration is
necessary, perhaps, to remind us that we are "formed" by the world even
as
we also "form" it.   Hayles's book on the posthuman, which I was reading
not too long ago, gives an interesting account of the role the frog
brain
played in Maturana and Varela's formulation of autopoietic theory, which
Hayles describes as an "epistemological revolution" precisely because of
the crucial role it gives to the "observer."  After studying froggie
perception in detail, and modeling the circuitry of the frog visual
system, M and V were able to see exactly how the frog brain constructed
its world, that frog's were constructed to see small, fast-moving
objects
(like flies-for-dinner) but not large slow-moving objects (like Chilean
biologists).  And, of course, we humans perform the same sort of
perceptual and cognitive tricks when "look" and "listen" and "feel" and
"smell" and "think."  But we wouldn't do any of it the same way if we
started with different givens, if we (but who would "we" be?) had
managed
somehow to evolve on Mars, say, rather than on Earth.   Around the time
of
that Social Text hoax scandal with the physicist who wrote the essay
full
of made-up pomo science, I remember scientists cracking jokes about pomo
theorists falling out of windows and not be able to talk their way out
of
gravity, and I thought the scientists had a pretty good point (even as I
also think that science is a culturally and historically and
economically
constructed enterprise, and that the ideal of "objectivity" is often
just
a crock).

So there's gravity, as an example of those conditions and constraints I
mentioned before, and it happens to be a whole lot more "pressing" on
Earth than on Mars, and our bodies, including eyes, ears, hands, lips,
tongues, larynxes, brains, have evolved accordingly.  Interesting, too,
to
think about how morphology, the shape of things, inflects any force or
law
we can imagine, including gravity itself, so that gravity on Earth is
far
from constant, despite the "mean" figure one can pluck from a chart (32
feet per second per second), depending on such factors as: the
centrifugal
force due to the Earth's rotation; elevation on the earth's surface;
tidal
variations (which depend on the movements of sun and moon, and which
therefore introduce time into the equation); and underground densities.
So, yes, the cosmos itself is embodied; it exists whether or not I think
it exists (though who knows, it may exist in a different way depending
on
what I decide!).  And when we posit a world made entirely of and by
language we may be performing something like the kind of operation we
carry out when we imagine ideal mathematical worlds.  So the
"constructivist" approach that seems to start out from such historicist,
relativist premises can end up becoming a kind of idealism?  Hmmm,
interesting, and that seems to be where I'm ending up for now, since
it's
time to go feed the baby (and I'm pretty sure he does exist, with his
pre-languaged needs and desires, like hunger).

For me at least, all this has implications of poetry, but I've run out
of

Yes, this is probably true.  But this, for me, is the "weak" linguacentric
position, not the "strong" one I was trying to address in my post.
Anything we say and think will be, in some sense, "languaged"; the
question for me is whether we feel the need to have that saying and
thinking address the possibility of reality "outside" language.  How one
answers that question has implications for how one writes poetry.

I might also say, though, that the question of "meaning" in visual art is
a slippery one as well.  In so far as "meaning" consists of talking, or
even thinking to oneself, about the art in some more or less articulate
way, then yes, this happens "through language."  But what about the sort
of more or less instantaneous, pre-verbal response one might have to the
first sight of the artwork.  What kind of "meaning" is this?  Does it come
"through language"?  I'm not sure of the answers to those questions.

Steve,
     It might be useful to turn the question around slightly and ask if
language or other semiotic symbols can grasp and convey to others what is
there prior to language?  This is a question that makes sense
neuorologically and psychologically.

Tom--Well, I would say, no, language *cannot* convey this experience.  And
that's what I find interesting.  Language can convey an approximation, a
representation that has to include a difference.  For me that kind of
slippage is part of what makes language, especially poetry,
interesting.  Now, textual  "differences" and slips and gaps are all the
theoretical rage these days, and that discourse is relevant to what I'm
interested in, but again there's a difference.  Mostly these slips and
gaps are examined only as textual phenomena, i.e. phenomena that arise out
of the way texts work.  But I'm interested in thinking about language
while keeping a (meta)physical sense of things, so that some of the slips
that intrigue me are what you might call primal ones.  We do *try* to
convey, we *want* to convey, and this attempt to put across what probably
cannot be communicated is something that moves me in some of the poetry I
like best.     steve

There is no 'other.'

The whole idea of language and symbol is 'to demarcate to create
boundaries' (security) which *in reality* cannot exist.

In reality, all things are ONE so that 'the razor cuts itself,' etc.

To step in/out, point at things, and say 'this is that,' and 'that is
this,' you must *necessarily* remove yourself from 'what is' (reality)
and the **accordance** through which it is (natural unity).

IF you go with the flow, one is not compelled to 'grasp and convey'
since one is always 'with' both beginning & end.

Certainty-of-arrival is *being* -- going with the flow -- as
contemporary as one can get, as up-to-date as possible, as *precise* as
'what is' (i.e. what exists ~ reality).

This is in opposition to attempting to know *in part* what one already
*is* in whole.

Hi,

I'm trying to locate the text in which Paul Bowles
discusses violence during Ramadan in Morocco, women
working magic on men with slips of paper closed in
jackknives, and a man who kills his wife because her
lack of salt-use convinces him she's a demon. I
believe they're all from the same essay and that it
was written in the mid-70's. Thanks.

well...yes...


truth is, language looks awful unnatural from this
angle...because, yes, it IS predicated on creating
boundaries (subject, predicate) which may in fact not
exist at all---if we're to take ANYTHING to REALLY
exist (i remain unconvinced, but willing to go along
with it--it's just so damned interesting...)

i always felt this quite keenly back in the acid
daze...LSD was hard to write on, precisely because in
it one was aware of the intense blurring of these
boundaries...felt, in fact, these distinctions to be
false...(the challenge was, and is, carrying this past
cheat sheets like LSD into the quotidian---i
unfortunately need these boundaries in my daily life,
but there are these beautiful moments, absolutely
straight and gorgeously sober, staring at say rain
over light that i feel again that blurring, feel the
unity in it all)---

of course, i could be completely wrong (i reserve the
right to contradict myself continually)---

an interesting aside: programming languages are
perhaps the most demarcated uses of these
boundaries...the most regimented of grammars...how
does one say i love you in cobol?

There is no 'other.'

The whole idea of language and symbol is 'to demarcate
to create
boundaries' (security) which *in reality* cannot
exist.

In reality, all things are ONE so that 'the razor cuts
itself,' etc.

To step in/out, point at things, and say 'this is
that,' and 'that is
this,' you must *necessarily* remove yourself from
'what is' (reality)
and the **accordance** through which it is (natural
unity).

IF you go with the flow, one is not compelled to
'grasp and convey'
since one is always 'with' both beginning & end.

Certainty-of-arrival is *being* -- going with the flow
-- as
contemporary as one can get, as up-to-date as
possible, as *precise* as
'what is' (i.e. what exists ~ reality).

This is in opposition to attempting to know *in part*
what one already
*is* in whole.

THE "F"-WORD (FUCK) STYLEGUIDE
BY RAY FEDERMAN (find it in "prefatory works" under the muse menu)
www.muse-apprentice-guild.com
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

                                * * *

Perhaps one of the most interesting and colorful words today is the word
"fuck".

It is the one magical word which just by its sound can describe pain,
pleasure, love, and hate.

                                * * *

In language, "fuck" falls into many grammatical categories.

It can be used as a verb, both transitive"John fucked Mary"

and intransitive "Mary was fucked by John"

It can be an action verb "John really gives a fuck"

a passive verb "Mary really doesn't give a fuck"

an adverb "Mary is fucking interested in John"

or as a noun "Mary is a terrific fuck"

It can also be used as an adjective "Mary is fucking beautiful"

or an interjection "Fuck! I'm late for my date with Mary"

It can even be used as a conjunction "Mary is easy, fuck she's also
stupid"

As you can see, there are very few words with the overall versatility of

the word "fuck".

aside from its sexual connotations, this incredible word can be used to
describe many situations :

1. Greetings "How the fuck are ya?"

2. Fraud "I got fucked by the car dealer."

3. Resignation "Oh, fuck it!"

4. Trouble "I guess I'm fucked now."

5. Aggression "FUCK YOU!"

6. Disgust "Fuck me."

7. Confusion "What the fuck.......?"

8. Difficulty "I don't understand this fucking business!"

9. Despair "Fucked again..."

10. Pleasure "I fucking couldn't be happier."

11. Displeasure "What the fuck is going on here?"

12. Lost "Where the fuck are we."

Please join Rodrigo and I in lifting a glass of... something to, uh...
ourselves...

Tuesday, May 27th...

to celebrate the launch of our books just out from Atelos Press.

Where: Spoonbill and Sugartown bookstore...

it's the L train, Bedford stop, head south a few blocks to "mini mall" (just
after Earwax records).

http://www.spoonbillbooks.com/

What time: 7-9.

There will be wine, cheese, olives, maybe a reading.

Both books will be on sale at discount.

Some of us will go out for dinner afterwards somewhere near and cheap.

Please read (but don't believe) the hype below:

***

Rodrigo Toscano's Platform is a political one; his writings are predicated
on the political conditions of contemporary life. But his work is not (and
will never be) predicted by those conditions; indeed, outwitting, unnerving,
and outspeaking the forces and figures clinging to control is one of his
signal artistic strategies. It would be correct to read Platform as a
triumphant product of precise and complex labor (thus adding to the
tradition set by of Louis Zukofsky). But where the spirit of Johann
Sebastian Bach informed Zukofsky's work, we would suggest that it is the
spirit of the Teatro Campesino that informs Toscano's  his poems carry out
brilliantly creative interventions. The works is bitingly inventive and yet
delicately meticulous; outrageous, funny, anti-hypocritical, and
"unfuckingrightgaggable," Platform is victory for the political intelligence
whose exercise is now, more than ever, a human necessity.

Rodrigo Toscano grew up in San Diego. After a few years in the San Francisco
Bay Area working as a social worker and an activist within the labor
movement, he moved to New York, where he continues this work. He is a
nationally influential writer, whose work along the intersections of social
and aesthetic activism is adding new dimensions to contemporary poetics.

Platform is Rodrigo Toscano's third book. His first book, The Disparities,
was published jointly by Green Integer and O Books in 2002. His second book,
Partisans (which, due to a variety of circumstances, came out before his
first), was published in 1999 by O Books.

Brian Kim Stefans' Fashionable Noise: On Digital Poetics eludes any singular
description  it is too various. At once, Fashionable Noise explodes with
ingredients of essay, games, and poetry, and it is always engaging, always
thought provoking. How does limitless replication and change affect a
dialogue one might try to have with another poet's words? What's so
interesting about the hidden code behind the link Walt Disney that
misdirects you, takes you to the wrong site? Stefans confronts these
questions, and the ease with which he simultaneously discusses,
investigates, and incorporates those elements that might make up a digital
poetics is astounding. Generating poetry with a computer program,
synthesizing Scots by using an algorithm accompanied by dictionaries,
employing an ICQ chat transcript as the conduit for delivering a significant
discussion on digital poetics: these are just a few examples of what readers
will find in this book. Although "the webwork, unlike the earthwork, can
never be photographed from a satellite perspective," Fashionable Noise: On
Digital Poetics is on the forefront of mapping out a rapidly emerging,
constantly morphing, virtual terrain.

Brian Kim Stefans is the author of Free Space Comix (1998), Gulf
(1998/2000), and Angry Penguins (2000). He has been an active presence on
the internet for several years, editing arras.net  a ceaselessly original
site devoted to new media poetry and poetics  and creating works such as
the acclaimed Flash poem "The Dreamlife of Letters" and a setting of the "e"
chapter of Christian Bk's Christian Bk's Eunoia. He is an active literary
and cultural critic, publishing frequently in the Boston Review, Jacket, and
elsewhere. He lives in New York City.

I liked this evocation of Ted Joans as the reality of Baudelaire's poet.  Before
Joans gets forgotten in this thread do you think you could type out one of Joans'
more important poems?  I don't know his work at all.  Corso refers to him several
times in his letters just out, usually rather negatively.  He refers to this thing
of him charging people for his presence as a negative aspect.  But Corso did pretty
much the same thing.  You had to pay him to get his signature in a book, for
instance.  The rate wasn't much -- five bucks in the seventies.  It probably went up
after that.  Poets don't make any money on royalties so to make a living you have to
be a bit shameless I imagine.  At any rate, what are Joans' most important poems?
Are any short enough to be typed out?

Stop me before I sign again!

Unless people start paying me $5 apiece, I will go out and sign every book I
can get my hands on in an effort to get my name out to people. I will be
doing this indiscriminately, signing good books and bad, and even signing
books that have already been signed by others. Once I have signed all the
books I can, I will start signing paintings, body parts, etc. So send me $5
right now and I will leave your books alone. Otherwise, beware of the serial
signer!

a time to stand-in - presents


say standing
say staining in advance
a thought in waiting
in a series of signals
  a serious image wont mind hard to find objects
working in progress with something all together syncopation
almost to say continues standing continues location

a logos chiseled with pretext
up down over-an-out here today spot and gone =93x=94
tomorrows not moving
standing =93not upon the order of going but go at once *
gather and remain; to stagnate; not to flow.
or the black water of pomptina stands. **

replacing another for another for
endure tolerate fate for
fast fall flung stained varnished vacuum and a spiral
standing still inevitable per served as guides to standards

a butterfly approaches a string of hope
advance though thought amplification
they then remember a deliverance
something mentioned

the thigh bone is connected to a simple pebble in past tense
thorn thread of a different something altogether
nonapologetic fills everything
photographic stand-ins advance
to three times . . . sinking ***

Ted wasn't, in my humble, a very good poet, but he was an extraordinarily
sweet and compassionate man. He was also a very good self-publicist. His
early rent-a-poet gigs were also meant as a send-up of the relationship of
the bourgeosie and the arts--the poet at the fancy soiree as a token, in
the sense of token representative, but also in the sense of a value
conveyed by his presence, a validation of a social position he didn't
share. This of course predates the modern bourgeoisie by a few millenia. In
Ted's hands it was a kind of perfoprmance art.

I miss listening to him.

Mark

Dearest Lewis:

Your original request, word for word, which I believe I satisfied exactly,
went as follows:

*****
how does one say i love you in cobol?

bliss
l
*****

I provided the COBOL way of saying it.  So why the CAPS SHOUTING in response
to my satisfaction of your request?  How to say "I love you" in COBOL.
There it is.  Is there something you are trying to express to me that is,
umm, between the lines that I'm simply missing?

Lewis, if I say "I love you," am I expressing it or am I merely typing it?
I think the answer to that question is the answer to your question.

And the answer is, you have no idea.

Love is a first-person phenomenon, whether that first-person be a human,
dog, or computer.  Therefore, you have no idea, and no matter what I say,
you still will have no idea.  That's the nature of love.  It's a mystery, an
unverifiable state.  It's a specific kind of the age-old general problem of
other minds.  But the first-person experience of love or of being or of hate
or of sadness or joy is a certainty beyond expression of that experience.
Which, oddly enough, makes certainty irrelevant.

Patrick

Unfortunately Nick seems not to be attending this thread but I'm struck with
the similarity to effective therapeutic communication where for me what the
client wants to articulate seems to be in his/her body or reside in the air

Locate I
love you some-
where in

teeth and
eyes, bite
it but

take care not
to hurt, you
want so

much so
little. Words
say everything.

I
love you
again,

then what
is emptiness
for. To

fill, fill.
I heard words
and words full

of holes
aching. Speech
is a mouth.

   Sorry to confuse..the poem OF COURSE is Ted's...
you can hear his voice in it..tho i never heard him read it..
he had a contentious relationship with Langston..as do we all both fathers and sons..and esp. spiritual fathers and sons..i think it belies the oft expressed view that Ted wasn't a wunderful poet..he certainly was an uneven one..and T.J..that's thank joans for that...who cares if its any good...the Norton Anth..Henry L. Gates...yo man..harry..

Dear, sweet Patrick,

love the examination of the "uncertainty" of love you
express here...

didn't mean to shout, only to bold...

yes, this code says i love you, but it doesn't really
use COBOL to do it...it uses to COBOL to print i love
you...there's nothing of love in the COBOL here, but
much about the output stream---

my original point was about how regimented code
is...so, you can get code to output any string you
want it to, but how do you get the code itself to
express love? because here the love isn't in the
language, it's in OUR language---and granted, the
COBOL isn't the machine's language either, but...



but i really do like your examination, your
explanation here!

bliss

Dearest Lewis:

Your original request, word for word, which I believe
I satisfied exactly,
went as follows:

*****
how does one say i love you in cobol?

bliss
l
*****

I provided the COBOL way of saying it.  So why the
CAPS SHOUTING in response
to my satisfaction of your request?  How to say "I
love you" in COBOL.
There it is.  Is there something you are trying to
express to me that is,
umm, between the lines that I'm simply missing?

Lewis, if I say "I love you," am I expressing it or am
I merely typing it?
I think the answer to that question is the answer to
your question.

And the answer is, you have no idea.

Love is a first-person phenomenon, whether that
first-person be a human,
dog, or computer.  Therefore, you have no idea, and no
matter what I say,
you still will have no idea.  That's the nature of
love.  It's a mystery, an
unverifiable state.  It's a specific kind of the
age-old general problem of
other minds.  But the first-person experience of love
or of being or of hate
or of sadness or joy is a certainty beyond expression
of that experience.
Which, oddly enough, makes certainty irrelevant.

Patrick

MIME-Version: 1.0

Could anybody explain what speech-act theory is, and whether it impact on our
conversation regarding extra-linguistic reality?  Does it mean that speech is
granted the status of an act, or something like that?

Does that bring language any more into the realm of the "real"?

I think that Saussure never meant to create a closed linguistic world.  He only
did so in order to clarify linguistic concepts.  He used organic metaphors.  He
said that the real of the signified was one side of a leaf, its signifier
another side.  He also did say that trees exist.  Even Lacan has the idea that
the realm of the real does in fact exist.

So I've been wondering where this whole idea that the real is only known through
its signifiers came from.  It could have come from Berkeley, but when you read
Berkeley you become inordinately aware of the real. Plus, he cheats.  He only
talks about singular large objects, like castles, sitting on the retina.  He
never talks about actually playing hopscotch, or anything more active than this,
in order to make his case that this world is God's language (a wonderful idea
with horrible implications if you start to think about SARS or even LYME's
DISEASE, which I spent the week pondering).

Does Derrida completely eclipse the real?

To some extent this IS a tendency in French postmodernism, but they never go
this far.  Lyotard says simply that when we speak it is something outside of
language, a subject, who is speaking.  He uses Frege to ground this.

What I think is needed is a language, a set of ideas, that is adequate to
reality.  That is, I pose language as something in between a subject and a real,
somewhat as the Dalai Lama posed causality.  With responsibility as a necessary
adjunct.  That is, if you are going to talk about an ideology then you also have
to pose consequences or else we are just in nowhere land.  What are the results
of choosing a spouse for instance through astrology?

What are the consequences of choosing employees via phrenology?

The kind of solipsism posited by everything is language sorta negates
consequences, methinks, although it's damned hard to move Bill Austin off this
post, and I'm not even going to try -- he's too clever.

So, what I think needs doing is to elaborate a language that has positive
effects.  I more or less think that Madison's Bill of Rights does achieve this.
I'm less sure of astrology or phrenology, to put it very mildly.  Madison's
Hobbesian view of human nature combined with his Lockean optimism has resulted
in a good sharp sense of checks and balances, combined with good possibilities
for all.  Thus it may fit into speech-act theory which I haven't looked up as um
creating a realm of possible human transactions that disbar exclusionary
radicalism from either right or left, and are inclusive, instead.

This kind of exclusion seems to me the remaining problem with the French left,
if they still matter to people (I think they are good mostly for laughs, but
laughter is not altogether a bad thing).  For instance, in the infamous History
of Sexuality by Foucault, he actually implies it's ok for a little girl to be
raped and used sexually by a field hand (pp. 30-32).  He says what's the
problem?  This is French village life!  This sort of language creates the
possibility for other kinds of actions.  Somehow the idea of judgment of
anything either right or wrong disappeared in the French left.

Language has to lay down clarity on some things -- like that child rape is
wrong, no?  Otherwise, what kind of society have you got?  This is where
religious language steps in -- the causality and the responsibility of the Dalai
Lama, or the Ten Commandments given to Moses.  It seems that Bill Austin isn't
going to grant any language any stronger values preference over any other
language.  Somehow if you don't have a real to refer to - the real of others'
suffering, for instance, you just float in an ether of meaninglessness.  So
therefore I think we have to posit as a minimal reality a kind of faith in
others' suffering.

~ *Yeats' too-smug phrase: 'clicked shut like a box'
__________________________________________


One shouldn't knock hard-headed maximal closure (hyperdetermination),
because it, *itself,* is the best evidence we have of impossibility
(uncertainty) -- which is to say maximal closure is not merely
'unbelievable,' but 'impossible.'

"The greatest poverty," said Wallace Stevens, "is not to live / In a
physical world . . . ."

And Keats, in describing 'Negative Capability' in his "Letters," was not
rejecting the epigrammatic as genre, but, as Romantic poet, he was
rejecting a 'style and attitude' rather than a *form.*

Which leads into:

>| http://ronsilliman.blogspot.com/#94779501
>|
>| Certainty is not the opposite of doubt, but rather
>| certainty is the opposite of complexity


Yes! And this is more how I like to think about -- that "strong and
wrong [is more useful] than weak and right."

Which is to say:

>| The relationship between certainty & doubt,
>| simplicity & complexity, intersects with poetry
>| at many different points & angles

...the same as the simple 'Law of Causes and Effects' produces
demonstrations/relations so great as to be infinite (Spinoza).

(Which is to say -- every observed effect in the universe, every
scientific law, every implement devised and built by engineers, every
trivial action of every animal, plant, and mineral in the known
universe, demonstrates the validity of the Law of Causes and Effects. Or
said differently, all these demonstrations fail to disprove the Law.)

In other words, by placing all-your-eggs in empiricism's leaky basket,
you achieve nothing more than what you set out to do.

Therefore, it is more useful to self-actualize, or rather, find
*contentment* (strong/certain action) with 'what is,' even if being
"smug," since this hyperdetermination is equally valid, and, in
addition, 'engenders repose' (generosity).

Hi all,

We've begun the massive job of cataloging the small press publications we've
acquired here at Boog City over the past 12 years, anticipating a late summer,
early fall opening of our nonlending small press library. (We'll be keeping
some hours, and also working on a by appointment basis for researchers and the
interested general public.)

If anyone is interested in assisting with this cataloging project, please
backchannel. There's no cash involved, but, as with all boog ventures, we can
fill yr belly with food, yr shelves with a vast array of small press ephemera,
and yr mind with the musings of our editorial staff.

as ever,
David

My apologies. It is indeed a Ted Joans poem. As I'd never before seen
any of Joans' work, I got cornfused and credited Po Nudel.

I still like the poem, regardless of the author.

Good comments, Lewis.

The warmth of words, the love they can radiate, comes from the etymology
within them,
while there's a coldness to code, because it has no past that is not our
present.
Code isn't human language yet, but a tool, like an obsidian knife that some
poets
 are using to try and whittle a ring.

Regards,
Joel

Subject:      Dispersion
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII

Dispersion


The spews and emissions of the universe are of fundamental consequence;
from plasmas through aerodynamics, particle fields through one-to-many
electromagnetic transmitters, dispersion characterizes the world. Objects
are temporary at best; objects cohere, disperse, decay, splinter,
dissolve, discharge, as in decathexis. What cathects is temporary at best;
'defuge' is a basic process that sloughs attentivity and value. As groups
form and dissolve, temporary genidentity structures local flows; one
participates, drops out, identifies, decathects, and so forth, from birth
to death; after death, the aura of effects transforms and continues, while
the name and provenance become increasingly remote.

Dispersion occurs on-line and off (Rheingold's Smart Mobs); packet
transmission itself is both dispersion and coalescence. If a site does not
acknowledge, error messages may be returned to the transmitter, as if they
were growing fainter (they do not) with each passing communication, until
the time limit is reached; then everything stops. Lost messages constantly
float, as do disconnected webpages, dead-ended links, any forms of
interruptions within the temporary flows and stases that constitute both
inter- and intranets.

Writing or programming or producing within these spaces, these paradigms,
(which themselves are in flux) is problematic; hardware and software,
languages and protocols, die out. There is an apocalyptic air to what can
only be labeled _dispersion production,_ an air of disappearance which
pervades the work produced; nothing is as permanent as modernism. What
remains is the remnants or residue of audience, for whom the work is
peripheral; instead, it is the political economy of the structure and
state-space of the work, in terms of communality and accessibility, that
determines its relative value. Genre, typology, typification, become
irrelevant, replaced by situational analysis. What is functional is the
occasion and occasioning of speech.

And speech is not only _parole,_ momentary enunciation; it parasitizes
writing and inscription. Inscriptive production problematizes and
occasions dispersion production; dispersion production problematizes and
occasions inscriptive production through speech and other communicative
acts.

We are mistaken to the extent we desire the occasion to override the
occasional. The occasional is the kernel (to the extent that the kernel
absorbs identity) of infinity; the disappearance of identity is also the
disappearance of all products of labor, piecemeal or otherwise. That is
why we say, "Nothing matters at all, except you!" "I am nothing without my
fans!" "The use-value is replaced by the exchange value!" "You are
everything to me!"

MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII

Nikuko-Dispersion


Nikuko-Dispersion is language independent, programming independent,
context-free, protocol independent. Nikuko-Dispersion is digital-eternal,
infinitely duplicated, the phenomenology of equivalence. The structure of
Nikuko-Dispersion is that of transmissions and receptions, transmittings
and receivings, a structure of residues and flows.

The digital-eternal is no such thing in praxis, therefore no such thing.
Masteries and technologies erode, are forsaken. Every potential well is
statistical at best. There are no ultimate solutions.

Nikuko-Dispersion is Nikuko-Filter, transformations in which the Nikuko
kernel is parasitic, the coloration of flux, just as all avatars are
filters. Someday we will find all entities, processes, continuums, states,
and operators are filters, that the cosmos is a collocation of filters and
jostlings of filters.

Nikuko-Filter adapts to languages, programs, and protocols. Nikuko-Filter
is an adaptation. Filter and Dispersion are equivalent; one is not the
parasitic on the other, nor is one the object to the process of the other.

What holds for Nikuko-Filter, Nikuko-Dispersion, holds for N-Filter,
N-Dispersion, where N is ontologically equivalent and dispersed among
traditional process- and entity-oriented ontologies. These transform-
ations are understood as fundamental to the universe in its entirety.

(Think of Filter-Dispersion, _difilter,_ _difiltering,_ _difiltration._
Any neologism will do.)

Thanks for the heads up, Tom. As for slippage, what about looking at this
from a temporal point of view,for example, a la Fitzgerald's idea that "We
beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly to the past? I
always think of these final lines of The Great Gatsby, in the sense that
what frequently appears as opacity, distortion or confusion may operate
linguistically or lexically as switching stations for  overlapping time
zones (memory): language keeps pushing us closer to reality, the
provocations that won't be accounted for. In psychoanalysis language at one
moment leads, at another follows, definer and defined, as in the process of
creating the poem. In poetry and in psychoanalysis, the "rules" of language
give way to and are reshaped by a quest for encompassment of experience, not
precision or accountability to received modes of classifying, describing or
explaining it.

Sorry if I'm a bit scattered here at 3am, post blogging. Did want to chime
in, though.

NTHPOSITION'S TIMES NEW ROMAN ANTHOLOGY NOW AVAILABLE ONLINE

Nthposition.com - the London-based online magazine which was active in =
promoting peaceful poetic protest during the anti-war campaign - has now =
released a ground-breaking e-book anthology of poems against 21st =
century empire.  The anthology - which it is hoped will be shared with =
poets and readers world-wide - is meant to continue to keep the issues =
raised by US/UK/UN occupation of Iraq in the pubic eye.

Mainstream media attention has drifted since the heady days of protest =
in January-March, now nearly as much a mirage as the non-existent WOMD =
used as a pretext for the illegal war on Iraq.  By focusing on poems =
which relate to themes of empire, colonization and anti-globalization, =
TIMES NEW ROMAN provides a rallying cry to those not just opposed to =
"war" but unchecked superpower expansion - and proposes a new role for =
poets, when being against war is no longer enough in itself.

The collection can be found at http://www.nthposition.com/timesnew.html =
in a form suitable for reading onscreen.  It also features powerful =
never-before-seen photos from the 1968 protests in Paris in stark =
counterpoint.  A chapbook version - which can be easily printed, copied =
and made into books for personal use or public readings - will be online =
end-of-week.  Everyone is encourage to copy and host these books on =
their own sites.  We would like to better our record, which saw =
Nthposition's 100 Poets Against The War downloaded over 150,000 times, =
inspiring readings and demonstrations from Tokyo to Toronto, Seattle to =
Oxford, Moscow to New York.

The poets in the collection are from Australia, Canada, Iraq, Ireland, =
India, the UK and the United States, among other places.  These poets =
offer a spectrum of compelling voices, from emerging to well-known, from =
traditional to avant-garde, and have all kindly donated their work to =
this project.  They are:

Adam Dressler, Audrey Ogilvie, Barbara Jane Reyes, Brentley Frazer, =
Catherine Kidd, Cathy Barber, Charles Bernstein, Todd Colby, Clive =
Matson, Daphne Gottlieb, Eleni Zisimatos Auerbach, Eileen Tabios, Eva =

"Renga - a collaboration by 11 artists".
Based on the ancient Japanese verse form of the same
name which translates as "linked verse",
"Renga" involved 11 artists, 5 British, 5 US and one
from Mexico, taking turns to continue
a piece of work over a 2 month period.
Artists were encouraged simply to respond honestly to
the work so far and no requirement
of stylistic unity was placed upon them.
All contributions had to include a forward link and
the pieces are now linked in a circle.
It is possible to start anywhere in the sequence.

US plans death camp
Herald Sun
26may03

http://www.news.com.au/common/story_page/0,4057,6494000%255E2,00.html

THE US has floated plans to turn Guantanamo Bay into a
death camp, with its own death row and execution chamber.

Prisoners would be tried, convicted and executed without
leaving its boundaries, without a jury and without right
of appeal, The Mail on Sunday newspaper reported
yesterday.

The plans were revealed by Major-General Geoffrey Miller,
who is in charge of 680 suspects from 43 countries,
including two Australians.

The suspects have been held at Camp Delta on Cuba without
charge for 18 months.

General Miller said building a death row was one plan.
Another was to have a permanent jail, with possibly an
execution chamber.

The Mail on Sunday reported the move is seen as logical by
the US, which has been attacked worldwide for breaching
the Geneva Convention on prisoners of war since it
established the camp at a naval base to hold alleged
terrorists from Afghanistan.

But it has horrified human rights groups and lawyers
representing detainees.

They see it as the clearest indication America has no
intention of falling in line with internationally
recognised justice.

The US has already said detainees would be tried by
tribunals, without juries or appeals to a higher court.
Detainees will be allowed only US lawyers.

British activist Stephen Jakobi, of Fair Trials Abroad,
said: "The US is kicking and screaming against any
pressure to conform with British or any other kind of
international justice."

American law professor Jonathan Turley, who has led US
civil rights group protests against the military tribunals
planned to hear cases at Guantanamo Bay, said: "It is not
surprising the authorities are building a death row
because they have said they plan to try capital cases
before these tribunals.

"This camp was created to execute people. The
administration has no interest in long-term prison
sentences for people it regards as hard-core terrorists."

Britain admitted it had been kept in the dark about the
plans.

A Downing St spokesman said: "The US Government is well
aware of the British Government's position on the death
penalty."

Just catching up with the digests and wanted to second the
recommendation for Mike Magee's terrific __MS__.  The subject's deep,
the beats phat, the cover freaky.  A great work to seek and enjoy with
summer here and the students gone.

No argument, Steve.  Of course the body--its physiology/senses--exercise a
crucial influence/limitation.  After all, language is cradled by brain matter.
It's just that everything you've written above is inscribed as, well,
language, as is external reality if we are to know it.  Could you think these things
without language?  Nope.  But I get from what you've written that you
understand that.

You wonder why, despite cogent arguments, you feel the need to resist.
Interesting.  Is such resistance less rooted in argument than in a psychology?  Any
ideas on this?

I withdraw my promise to shut up.  I love this stuff.  Sue me.  Best, Bill

<<Could anybody explain what speech-act theory is, and whether it impact on
our
conversation regarding extra-linguistic reality?  Does it mean that speech is
granted the status of an act, or something like that?


Does that bring language any more into the realm of the "real"?


I think that Saussure never meant to create a closed linguistic world.  He
only
did so in order to clarify linguistic concepts.  He used organic metaphors.
He
said that the real of the signified was one side of a leaf, its signifier
another side.  He also did say that trees exist.  Even Lacan has the idea that
the realm of the real does in fact exist.


So I've been wondering where this whole idea that the real is only known
through
its signifiers came from.>>

Kirby,

This does not follow from that.  Saussure's use of metaphors, organic or
otherwise, does not do any injury to the view that meaning is a product of
language.  In fact, metaphors are a pretty good indication that "nature" is
meaningful as nature precisely because its value/identity is produced by language.  For
Saussure, the signifier and signified are both parts of the word.  Of course
trees exist.  But they are not "trees" until the word appears, until that word
functions within language.  The name, Kirby, for example, would be a
combination of meaningless sounds if it were not part of a semiotic system.  It
certainly could not designate a person, especially since the word "person" wouldn't
function as a meaningful concept either.  It does follow from what Saussure
and Lacan wrote that knowledge is semiotic.  Consider Lacan's idea of the mirror
je.  There can be no "je' without the word, and the word signifies a
signified that is a kind of fiction (the mirror image).  This is a gross
oversimplification of Lacan, but for the sake of space . . . .  Even the subconscious, for
Lacan, is linguistic.

The idea that "the real is only known through its signifiers" does come from
the people you mention, or rather is promoted by them since they were not the
only scholars at work on the issue.

Speech-act theory, of which Lyotard and Rorty make use (though they both move
in and out), shifts the source of truth-value from a priori centers to
performative/rhetorical dispersals.  In other words, the "truth" of a statement
(language again) depends not on the controlling and unifying power of reason, but
on its persuasiveness.  This amounts to a kind of consensus theory.  TRUTH in
the metaphysical sense takes a beating from these guys.  Both men are radical
pragmatists and interrogate reason/the rational to the point of dismissing
it--at least they think they're dismissing it.  Ironically, it is Derrida who
argues for reason and truth, not as absolutes, but as provisional sites that one
can never escape.  He demonstrates that any attempt to dismantle metaphysical
truth-value/reason must operate within the scaffolding of metaphysics/reason,
and so ends up restoring (re-privileging) the very thing one is trying to
undo.  Any critique of logocentrism inevitably works within the borders of meta
physics, simultaneously dismantling and restoring.  This is indeterminacy, Kirby.
 American deconstructionists completely misread Derrida on this matter.

Speech-act theory finds a part time comrade in Husserl who worships at the
altar of the logos (a priori principles, god, etc.), unlike Lyotard and Rorty
who take sledgehammers to it.  For Husserl, truth is apprehended via a
structure's repeatability (e.g., geometry).  He argues that a structure's infinite
repeatability reactivates the structure's self-identical, absolute origin, its a
priori source which prefigures the structure and is available to a self-present
comprehension (cf. Descartes).  So contact with the origin is possible for
Husserl who effectively argues for a stable logocentric development based on
truths that cannot be questioned since thinking is impossible without them.

Derrida does a pretty neat number on the guy.  In sum, he points out that
Husserl cannot make his arguments without language, cannot deploy his concepts
without language (writing/inscription--of which speech is a variety since spoken
"acts" must obey the same rules as writing in order to be meaningful, to be
"speech").  So here we are again.  Husserl's a priori "ideal" is possible
(cogent) only within a system rooted in interdependency, indeterminacy.

Sorry to take up so much of your time.  I hope there's something new here for
you, and I'm not just repeating myself.  You did ask.  I'll shut up now.
Promise.

Best, Bill

Interesting questions, Bill.  I'm afraid I don't have any deep insights
into my own psychology here.  I think I think I feel the need to resist
because I don't very often, at least among poets, encounter the position
that I'm trying to articulate.  And I think the super- strong
linguacentric position seems to
lead too easily to a kind of hubristic feeling that we can invent
*everything* through language (e.g., there was an old Langpo aphorism that
went something like "language control = thought control = reality
control").

I've been trying like hell not to quote
Oppen here, since that's what I usually do in these situations, but oh
well, here goes.  I like a couple of statements of his (among many
others).  The first is that the poem must be concerned with a fact it did
not create--the world.  The second is that his job as a poet is to
discover, not invent.

But I'm not arguing for any kind of escape from language.  I know it's
what we've got--and it can be a lot of fun.

Steve

Bill,

Don't worry about shutting up.  My only fear is that you might cave.  Don't do that.  I enjoy
tring to find an alternate route in behind this seemingly impregnable theory of yours.  Just
tell me: who's the best linguist, are who are the best set of linguists (school) that argue
for an extra-linguistic reality that language merely ahem describes?  Does that exist
anywhere?

It seemed to me that Lacan does argue that there are three levels of reality -- the real, the
imaginary, and the symbolic.  He posits the real, but argues that we are always in the
imaginary.

I saw a great interview with Jennifer Flowers once where she was talking about then-president
Clinton, and how he called his testicles, "the boys."  Here is the phallus, that is, the
president of the country, the ruler, and all that, and his penis had a real to it (I am trying
to get this down to biological reality all the time as I think that I then have the best
chance of escaping the flight of the signifier), which means that either it does or it doesn't
"function" in any given encounter with Ms. Flowers -- she claimed it always did, but it is
technically within reason that it might at some point not come through for him -- so it is the
real, that is the penis; the symbolic, which is the phallus, the great office-holder of the
probably not-exclusively oral office -- and in between is the imaginary: the boys.

Lacan seems to argue that all three of these levels do exist, but we are always on the
spectrum flying between the real and the symbolic.

The interview was conducted by Geraldo Rivera in about 1994.  I was reading a lot of Lacan at
the time.

Would you agree with my breakdown of Clinton as seen by Ms. Flowers?

That is, that there is a real penis, and a symbolic phallus, in this scenario?

I'm not sure where to put "the boys" here, except into the imaginary.  Would that be where you
were to put them?

It's not my fault that we end up back at the penis.  It's Freud's fault.  He started this
mess, and it is because of him that this has become such a big thing in French theory.  That
is, if you can get the signifiers to change camps, then women can not only hold the phallus,
as in Jennifer Flower's case, they can actually represent it, if that's right, such as a judge
like Sandra Day O'Connor being able to bang the gavel right there with Clarence Thomas.  The
gavel being the symbolic phallus.  Or the scepter.  This began with politics, I think -- and
the use of psychoanalysis -- to get the web of language to move in new directions, so that it
didn't discriminate against anyone on the basis of biology.  Simone de B's Second Sex is all
about this, too.

But I think that in order to do this, they have to shove biology well into the background.
I'm confused as to how far this has gone, and how far it ought to go, but it's the same thing
that we're still arguing about in the culture: should women serve front-line duty in combat,
should women be firemen, etc.  That's the real USE of this, so far as I can see, and perhaps
the reason it's held to so strongly.

It's not just a technical point at all, right?

It wasn't with Berkeley either, but he was trying to defend another set of goods having to do
with his duties as a bishop.

I thought the Joans poem packed a wallop.  If I hadn't read the commentary, I
would have thought he was praising Langston Hughes for creating such a strong
rich world, but you're saying that he actually was criticizing Hughes for his
limited vocabulary and range of subject matter?  That's even more interesting.
Did Joans consider himself to be a surrealist?  I know that he knew Breton, and
in the biographical piece on the crowd he was said to have known the origins of
the Max ERnst image of the 100 heads.  Was he then a student/practitioner of
surrealism?  Is that why he was criticizing Langston Hughes -- for his social
realistic Marxist aesthetics?  He does say at the end of the poem that he was
the greatest black poet.  Is he criticizing then black poetry (or even protest
poetry) generally?

Kirby, if you can handle, so to speak, a recommendation, I suggest you get
yourself into the Guggenheim - or if you are near San Francisco, the Castro
Theater - for Mathew Barney's Cremaster 3 - which is, I think, an
aesthetically astonishing and imaginatively exhaustive interior exploration
of the "heroic" life of the American phallus via the interior (mostly) of
New York's Chrysler building.  If Hart Crane's celebration of the Brooklyn
Bridge is a hymn to the American industrial sublime, the Chrysler Building
(fiftie's model cars crushing and vanquishing Gary Gilmore's dark hearse in
the otherwise empty art deco lobby, Richard Serra as mega builder/demonic
father in the tower, and the Beuys-esque dark comedic Barney ascent via
elevator shaft cables) is the Bridge's sublime dark inverse.     The work
definitely gives a much greater "epic fix" on whatever might define male
gender possibilities and terrors than anything else I know on the
contemporary visual level or perhaps any other medium.
In the Bay Area the Castro - which is just the right interior architecture
for the film - is showing 3-4 through Thursday, and the other two sections
subsequently.

I'd be interested in other takes on Barney's adventure. The work is so
lit-cultural-poetic - it will be nice to know if there is some good writing
about the work by poets rather than folks who keep inside the limits of art
crit.

a lot of time together, the ties among them soon will be the equivalent of=

Ruef also has found that people tend to be more creative and innovative=20

Kirby,
     I think I recall that this discussion had its roots in the end of
theory and theorists where I would have to place Freud and Lacan
psychologically (speaking, so-to-speak?) along with big name philosophers
and linguists.  As Nick agreed (I don't necessarily need to include you in
this extreme statement, Nick), these writing and language-based
theoreticians are not really of much interest in the REALITY of day-to-day
practical therapy or healing.  Thus, it is quite serendipitous that this
came across my screen from another list today
http://implicit.harvard.edu/implicit as implicit knowledge is part of
burgeoning hard-science biased experimental research literature documenting
the rEALITY of the preconscious. [it might be that there is an 'unconscious'
or preconscious bias toward languge-based thought on this list?  In any
event, try it, you might like it]
     I think Antin, for example, should be read along with this literature.
I also think the stuff Pennebaker is working on is quite relevant, as well .
I wish I had the energy to put something together here but it is really
quite readable stuff (if you ignore or use a blank marker for the scientific
terms) but I just may be a weirdo in that I anticipate the arrival of the
new Journal of Clinical and Consuting Psychology as I   anticipate the
latest poetics compendium.

Yep.  He did cheat.  For one, he does not apply the same doubt to god's

I'm not sure if we agree or disagree on this.  I don't see how biology has
been shoved into the background.  Language theory doesn't really change
anything.  We still live in a world of chairs and tables.  It just explains how things
mean.

Don't know of any.  That's pre-20th century.  I agree with everything you
said about Clinton's penis.  But maybe I shouldn't be so quick to agree.  I've
never actually seen Clinton's penis.  I have no interest in Clinton's penis.
All I have to go on is Flowers' "WORD!!!!" for it.  Just kidding.

I never said nothing was real.  Again, the difference is between what is
"purely" external to language (noumena?  Hume's Impressions?) and its
meaning/mediation by language.  We live in the imaginary, right?  We are bound to and by
that mediation.  How does one escape this world of words?  I guess for most of
us regressing to infancy is out of the question.  Death probably works, but
I'm against it.

Doesn't everything?  Romanticism was twisted into Napoleon.  Nietzsche was

The idea that anyone, or any group, can control the structural evolution of
language is silly.  But that doesn't stop some people from trying and from
deluding themselves that they've succeeded.  Every attempt to limit discourse--to
set the agenda, so to speak--results in the roaring return of the banished.
But of course you're right to worry.  Few things more dangerous than the

As usual, I have very little time to contribute to this rather fascinating discussion. But I couldn't resist! What is compelling about this thread?

First, no, we couldn't think "these things" without language, but the question, I thought was could we think without language. Following the arguments of Maturana & Varela, everything thinks - is cognizant - not only without language, but without a brain! This relatively new "discovery" has led to those in AI to dramatically rethink the possibilities of AI.. thus we now have ALife, etc. No doubt language is important, but we have to consider it along with everything else we organisms are doing. So much for language being in brain matter.

Following on from that, Bill's post presupposes a 'knowable' external reality, as though there is this absolute in the first place. Santiago theory also posits the idea of "bringing forth" the world, rather than the world just existing, which would help get us out of all these dates dualisms, would it not? Anyhow, wouldn't language in this case be not referring to something "in the world" but something we experience as the world, determined by our physiological structure, environment, etc?

AS for the Cremaster. Interesting someone bought this up here. I just spent the weekend arguing over Matt Barney's project at the Nippori Bathhouse. Now, only one of us had actually been to see his work, the rest of us were basing our opinions on the HUGE silver tome that has flooded (walled in?) Tokyo art book shops. Basically, I don't really like what he's doing at all. It seems to be all spectacle and shock, and short on ideas, rather like the YBA's. The glossy book just reinforces the shock value for me. The view of the Cremaster as the American Phallus is entertaining. However, since male gender possibilities are hardly new, I haven't worked out why a mutilated version should be of any more interest. I did Rocky Horror in my teens.

If you want poetic art projects, why not check out Eduardo Kac? http://www.ekac.org I know of one listee who has written about him.

Sorry if my reply seems a little abbreviated.

-Ben

No argument, Steve.  Of course the body--its physiology/senses--exercise a
crucial influence/limitation.  After all, language is cradled by brain matter.
It's just that everything you've written above is inscribed as, well,
language, as is external reality if we are to know it.  Could you think these things
without language?  Nope.  But I get from what you've written that you
understand that.


You wonder why, despite cogent arguments, you feel the need to resist.
Interesting.  Is such resistance less rooted in argument than in a psychology?  Any
ideas on this?


I withdraw my promise to shut up.  I love this stuff.  Sue me.  Best, Bill

excellent piece, alan. i don't agree with some of it, as you might surmise, but the drift and
topics are things i also have been thinking about, and your piece addresses many of these
eloquently. yes, the work is peripheral to most. but is it to you? i don't think it is to me. it
is to those who primarily seek an occassion for their own speech. of course, the lists are, by
their nature, dialogical and no individual post stands out like no letter on a page stands out.

i wonder how much work it would take to make some software that would crawl a list, download all
the posts, and then provide an excellent inteface into the list so that it was sortable and
searchable (via an index) and the links worked and so on. and so that you could also delete
posts. though if it's searchable nicely and sortable via name and thread and all that, it
becomes less necessary to provide things like deletion in order to provide an interesting
literary experience.

many lists are now searchable and sortable, etc, but usually the interfaces are not particularly
rich and the operations are slow.

a good spider and a good index builder would be the first steps here. i'm using atomz for my
search engine on my site, and that builds a good index... anyway, you see the drift, toward
creating something that could go on a CD, say, and would provide an interesting literary
experience, a list reader.

could also have it be able to connect to the list, if it were ongoing, and check for new posts,
perhaps.

a fundable project. even a commercial product, perhaps, in the end, if it were general enough to
be used on just about any list.

I should add that Cremaster is also full of humor or, I guess the fancy
word, the "comedic." Which belies the narcissistic, or "spectacle shock"
lang used  to dismiss it - which was my impulse before I saw it. And I think
it is also a mis-configuration to define or delimit the work as a "gay'
property (perhaps akin to an expensive variation on Herb Ritts). Granted the
work is not without homo-erotic tension, but the intellectual, literary and
aesthetic smarts here are much more ambitious - taking on issues of male
conquest in a larger American frame of which what is gay and androgynous are
but significant elements of the film's drama and history.

Still new to his films, I would like to hear more from others who are more
familiar with what they see is going on.

 I hope, like Stephen and Ben, that others can contribute here. Stephen says
he's new to Barney's films, Ben reports on a discussion in which only one
person had seen the work. My experience is similar in that I spent two and
half hours at the Guggenheim only to realise I needed to spend a week there.
First because the films seem to be at the heart of the projects and they'r
not programmed so that you can see them in a day or two. The installations
are like spin offs or displays of props etc. The other thing is that the
work is extremely ambitious and complex, obsessive in many ways--indeed in
these respects it is about as far removed from the YBAs as you can get. I
should say I've seen many videos and sculpture shows and the reason why I
wanted to go the the Guggenheim show is I found his work consistently
compelling visually, I can go on, but that should be it for now.

Luciano Berio, 77, Composer of Mind and Heart, Dies
By PAUL GRIFFITHS

Luciano Berio, an Italian composer whose many compositions, ranging=20
from chamber music to large-scale orchestral works and from operas to=20
songs, combined innovative imagination and analytical depth with a=20
richly sensuous feeling for sound and form, died yesterday in Rome. He=20=

was 77.

An outstanding orchestral and vocal composer who was perhaps most=20
remarked upon for his works with solo voice, he was especially known=20
during his long residence in New York City for conducting his own works=20=

with the Juilliard Ensemble, which he founded.

Mr. Berio's love for music was exuberantly promiscuous, and it drew him=20=

close to Italian opera (especially Monteverdi and Verdi), 20th-century=20=

modernism (especially Stravinsky), popular music (the Beatles, jazz),=20
the great Romantic symphonists (Schubert, Brahms, Mahler) and folk=20
songs from around the world. All gave him models for original=20
compositions or arrangements, or for works that were neither entirely=20
new nor entirely old, works in which threads of the old could be=20
combined with new strands. An outstanding example is the middle=20
movement of his "Sinfonia" for orchestra and vocal octet (1968-9),=20
where the entire scherzo from Mahler's "Resurrection" Symphony rolls=20
along, supporting a tapestry of short quotations, new ideas and spoken=20=

interjections. Even when his music is ostensibly original it conveys a=20=

homage to the past. For him to write an opera, a concerto, a string=20
quartet or a piece for solo clarinet was to contribute to a tradition.=20=

That did not mean following traditional forms, which would have been=20
far from his thinking. Rather, the piece would emerge and develop as if=20=

it were a memory, evoking textures and situations from the past.

Mr. Berio was born on Oct. 24, 1925, into a musical family long=20
resident in the Ligurian coastal town of Oneglia. His grandfather was=20
his first teacher, and he grew up surrounded by chamber music.=20
Immediately after World War II he entered the Milan Conservatory, where=20=

he studied composition with Giorgio Federico Ghedini, whose neo-Baroque=20=

style was an early influence, along with the music of Stravinsky.

Among his fellow students was the American singer Cathy Berberian, whom=20=

he married in 1950, and with whom he made frequent visits to the United=20=

States, encountering a fellow Italian, Luigi Dallapiccola, at=20
Tanglewood and electronic music in New York. Under these influences he=20=

entered the modernist stream with works like "Chamber Music" (1953), a=20=

set of James Joyce songs he wrote for Ms. Berberian to sing with=20
clarinet, cello and harp.

A meeting with another Italian, Bruno Maderna, brought him to the=20
Darmstadt summer school, the annual meeting place in Germany for the=20
European avant-garde. He attended regularly between 1954 and 1959, and=20=

so came to know Pierre Boulez, Karlheinz Stockhausen, Gyorgy Ligeti,=20
Mauricio Kagel among others. Contributing to their endeavors for=20
radical innovation, he produced his most complicated conceptions,=20
notably "Tempi Concertati" for flute, violin, two pianos and four=20
instrumental groups (1958-9).

Other works of this period include his first electronic pieces. He was=20=

co-director with Maderna of a studio for electronic music at the Milan=20=

station of Italian radio and produced one of the early classics of tape=20=

music: "Thema (Omaggio a Joyce)" (1958), based on a recording of Ms.=20
Berberian's reading from Joyce's "Ulysses." In the same year, with=20
"Sequenza I" for flute, he instituted a series of solo studies, each=20
considering the history, performance style and aura of an instrument.=20
By the time of his death he had composed 14 such pieces, for most of=20
the standard Western instruments, including the human voice.

As patterns of virtuosity, these pieces often prompted elaboration. For=20=

example, "Sequenza VI" (1967), which has a viola player scrubbing=20
vigorously at tremolo chords, generated in succession "Chemins II" for=20=

the same viola player with nonet (1967), "Chemins III" for the viola=20
with orchestra (1967), "Chemins IIb" for small orchestra (1969), a=20
score from which the original solo viola has disappeared, and "Chemins=20=

IIc" (1972), in which it has been replaced by a bass clarinet. Here Mr.=20=

Berio was using his own music in the ways he often used others' music,=20=

as material to be analyzed, explored, imitated and developed.

Meanwhile, he was pursuing his fascination with the human voice and=20
with the drama of song.

Mr. Berio's first composition for the theater, "Passaggio," had its=20
premiere at the Piccola Scala in Milan in 1963 and was a provocative=20
expression of its sole female character's subjection to social=20
pressures. Subsequently his dramatic works became more poetic than=20
political. "Laborintus II" (1965) is based on an anticapitalist poem by=20=

his longstanding friend Edoardo Sanguineti, but the music provides a=20
gorgeous, dreamlike flow of imagery for voices and chamber orchestra,=20
more engulfing than supporting the reciter.

Between 1963 and 1971 Mr. Berio lived largely in New York with his=20
Japanese-American second wife, Susan. He taught at the Juilliard=20
School, where he founded the Juilliard Ensemble, and became more active=20=

as a conductor. He wrote "Sinfonia" for Leonard Bernstein and the=20
Philharmonic, and his first full-scale opera, simply called "Opera,"=20
for the Santa Fe Opera, which produced it in 1970.

In 1972 he returned to Italy, to a house on the edge of the hill town=20
of Radicondoli, near Siena. In the mid-70's he became a co-director of=20=

Mr. Boulez's computer music institute in Paris, which he left in 1980=20
to establish his own facility in Florence, Tempo Reale.

His biggest work of the decade after "Opera" was "Coro," for 40 singers=20=

and 40 instrumentalists (1975-6), an interweaving of folksong-inspired=20=

melodies with massive choral settings of words by Pablo Neruda,=20
contrasting individual freedom with oppressive authority. He then=20
returned to opera for two collaborations with Italo Calvino: "Una vera=20=

storia," first performed in Florence in 1982, and "Un re in Ascolto,"=20
written for the 1984 Salzburg Festival.

Both these works were, like "Opera," deconstructions of the genre. The=20=

first part of "Una Vera Storia" is a theatrical analysis of Verdi's "Il=20=

Trovatore," the second a new synthesis of the discovered=20
musical-dramatic elements. "Un re in Ascolto," which was given its=20
American premiere by the Lyric Opera of Chicago in 1996, reworks parts=20=

of Shakespeare's "Tempest" in a form in which rehearsal, performance=20
and memory coalesce.

Narrative is still more dissolved in "Outis," first performed at La=20
Scala, Milan, in 1996. The opera is loosely based on the myth of=20
Odysseus and incorporates 20th-century images of assassination, exile=20
and genocide. "Cronaca del Luogo," performed at the 1999 Salzburg=20
Festival, was a return to the format of "Passaggio," with a single=20
female character but now representing the heroic women of the Hebrew=20
Bible.

The concern with Jewish subject matter in these later operas =97 as well=20=

as in the magnificent "Ofanim" for instrumental groups, children's=20
voices, electronic resources and, again, a solo female vocalist=20
(1988-97) =97 was stimulated by his third wife, the Israeli-born Talia=20=

Packer Berio, who was as important an influence on the music he wrote=20
in his 60's and 70's as Berberian had been in his 20's and 30's. Ms.=20
Packer Berio created the libretto for "Cronaca del Luogo" and also drew=20=

her husband's attention to the symphonic sketches by Schubert that he=20
used in "Rendering" for orchestra (1988-90).

Other late orchestral works, notably "Formazioni" (1985-7) and=20
"Concerto II" with solo piano (1988-90), show Mr. Berio's continuing=20
ability to find new ways for the orchestra to speak, vividly and=20
beautifully, while solo instruments went on having their say as he=20
extended the "Sequenza" series. But perhaps his most personal and=20
powerful achievements are works centered on a solo female voice, all=20
the way from "Chamber Music" to "Cronaca del Luogo": music that=20
celebrates an individual's capacity, even in an unhearing world, to go=20=

on expressing pathos, love and imagination.

He is survived by Ms. Packer Berio, of Radicondoli and Florence, and by=20=

two daughters, two sons and two grandchildren.

   game girl advance

   home features archives about

   May 23, 2003
   matthew barney versus donkey kong
   Barney versus Donkey Kong From the Editor:=20

        In this month's feature, Wayne Bremser compares the properties
of
        Donkey Kong to the aesthetics of Matthew Barney's provocative
film,
        Cremaster 3. Wayne is a writer and old-school game enthusiast.
His
        current projects include Harlem.org, a jazz history site, and
        BeatThief.com. It's obvious from his writing that he is skilled
and
        smart; but you should also know that he brandishes a positively
wicked
        sense of humor, too. He lives in San Francisco and is working on
his
        first novel.

   Matthew Barney's Cremaster 3 begins a serious negotiation between art
   and video games. There have been exhibits and books celebrating game
   design in recent years, while digital art has introduced
interactivity
   into museums. Painters have created canvases with game characters.
   Cremaster 3 lacks the obvious cultural references, but its absurdity,
   repetition, level design and use of landscape as narrative
establishes
   a stronger connection to video games than these other works.

   Despite the popularity of the Cremaster films, only a small
percentage
   of museumgoers have ever seen an art film. After twenty-five years of
   cultural relevance, video games still do not have a serious place in
   museums and galleries. Cremaster 3 is important not only because it
   has attracted a wider audience to an art film, but also because it is
   one of the first works of contemporary art to incorporate video game
   narrative.
   film and game adaptations=20

   Most museums and galleries have ignored games, while technological
   progress has drawn mainstream film and games together. This
   relationship can be charted by the number of games adapted from
films.
   More recently, a number of films have been based on popular video
   games. Most of these films have been terrible.

   Faced with adaptation, a film director has less freedom than a game
   designer. Technology limitations are small obstacles compared to a
   mainstream film audience that will not accept the absurd and abstract
   elements found in games. Audiences will not watch a film that has no
   spoken dialogue, forcing the film director to make her video game
star
   speak for two painful hours.

   While nuances of character remain a challenge for many designers,
   games have been able to capture film environments for quite some
time.
   Film to game adaptation is more successful because the medium forces
a
   reduction of plot and character without sacrificing a film's
narrative
   world.

   Beyond adaptation, several directors have been able to translate the
   compelling elements of the game medium into original films. One of
the
   first successful attempts was Tron, which distilled sweeping, cool
   blue silent film landscapes from early games like Battlezone and
   Missile Command. Incorporating graceful motion and an element of
   minimalist abstraction, the film's gladiatorial sequences are
   wonderful cinema. Audiences didn't respond; Tron's arcade adaptation
   was more popular and profitable than the film.

   Twenty years after Tron, Cremaster 3 presents a mythic narrative
   cobbled together from Masonic legend and Matthew Barney's
   self-referential symbols. This is the last film in Barney's five
   Cremaster films, named after the muscle that controls the rising and
   lowering of the testicles. Without the expectations of a mainstream
   film audience and the responsibilities of a commercial director,
   Barney has the freedom to create a film loaded with the repetitive,
   ritualistic and quasi-mythical elements commonly found in video
games.
   Offering three dialogue-free hours of whimsy and discomfort,
Cremaster
   3 is an art world adaptation of Donkey Kong.

   At a Cremaster 3 screening Richard Flood, the chief curator of the
   Walker Art Center, mentioned that he had recently seen Gangs of New
   York. He wondered whether Barney was "a better director than Martin
   Scorsese." Answering himself, Flood said, "I think he might be."
   Critics and curators should not be concerned with the comparison of
   art films to commercial films, Matthew Barney versus Martin Scorsese.
   Cinema's journey to get into the museum is over. Today's struggle
   concerns Matthew Barney versus Donkey Kong.

 | The Masons and Hiram Abiff

millions

 | Tracing their origin back to biblical times, Freemasons celebrate the

 | Fellowcraft, Master Mason, Mark Master, etc). Barney's character in
 | the film, the Entered Apprentice appears at the bottom of the order
 | (represented by diagrams of steps or ladders). As a rite of passage,
 | the candidate for Master Mason will be taken through a ritual of
three
 | stages, which simulates the experience Abiff went through holding
onto
 | his secrets and integrity against his three attackers.

   The plot of Cremaster 3 is taken from the Masonic order and the myth
   of Hiram Abiff (see sidebar), but the narrative center of the film is
   found in its architectural spaces. Before being populated with
   adversaries, spaces in Cremaster 3 and video games are transformed
   sculpturally to create an arena for action. Barney and game designers
   look for strong visual landscapes that are ripe for a character's
   running, jumping, smashing and climbing.

   Barney's locations include a heavy layer of personal and cultural
   meaning that game designers often ignore. He builds and qualifies
   levels with variations on color and light, giving the viewer signs
   about the amount of danger the protagonist faces. The majority of the
   film takes place in the Chrysler Building and the Guggenheim Museum
in
   New York. The interiors have been altered to remove the buildings
from
   reality, much in the way a game that relies on real locations focuses
   on certain details and erases others to establish a backdrop that
   enhances game play without getting in the way of it.

   Both Barney's Entered Apprentice and Mario climb structures modified
   from what architects have intended. In the Chrysler Building Barney
   ascends the elevator shaft, which exposes the building's innards. In
   the rivets degree of Donkey Kong, Mario must climb around an exposed,
   unfinished structure, walking over rivets to remove them. The perfect
   disorder of the titled girders in the ramps degree of Donkey Kong,
   transformed by an enormous jumping ape, match the perfect order of
the
   ramps in Guggenheim rotunda, created by the most famous American
   architect. A climbing rig allows Barney to scale the rotunda,
   bypassing the ramps.

   In both Cremaster 3 and Donkey Kong, reaching the top level of the
   structures both rewards the protagonist and punishes him for hubris.
   When Mario reaches the top of the steel structures, Donkey Kong finds
   a way to take Pauline away to the next screen. When Barney's Entered
   Apprentice reaches the top of the Chrysler Building the film cuts to
a
   scene where he suffers a setback: his teeth are knocked out.

   [guggvkong.jpg]

   The Entered Apprentice is then placed in the Guggenheim sequence,
   which opens with naked women that introduce players to each level of
   the game. The scene feels like a parody of a television quiz show
   mixed with a video game's level introductions. Recall Donkey Kong
   asking the player, without a wink, "How high can you get?"

 | "This scene was shot in the rotunda of the Guggenheim Museum on the
 | different levels and feels almost like a video game. There are five
 | levels, which take on five different allegories of the five Cremaster
 | chapters [films]." - Matthew Barney

   In Donkey Kong and Cremaster 3 levels are determined by a combination
   of architecture and dangers that await the protagonist. Each ramp of
   the Guggenheim features a test, symbolizing Barney's five Cremaster
   chapters, his own quasi-Masonic ritual of passage, an artist testing
   his own artistic progress. Barney uses the museum space as an
   interface to both confront and create art. With the tools of a Mason,
   Barney calculates and smashes his way to the top of the rotunda,
   leaving a trail of work cobbled together from shards of previous
   generations.

   Donkey Kong (arcade version) has four degrees:

     * Ramps: Mario must climb steel beams that the ape has titled by
his
       ferocious jumping.
     * Girders: Mario must deconstruct a girder structure by removing a
       series of rivets. Kong tumbles to ground.
     * Elevators: Mario must jump between a set of fast moving elevators
       to reach Pauline.
     * Factory: In a pie factory with moving conveyor belts.

   Guggenheim in Cremaster 3 has five degrees:

     * Order of the Rainbow for Girls: Duck the legs of Rockette-style
       women in bunny suits.
     * Agnostic Front versus Murphy's Law: Recover Masonic tools in
floor
       between two 1980's hardcore bands in a battle of the bands.
     * Aimee Mullins: Battle beautiful woman that transforms into a
       deadly cat.
     * Five Points of Fellowship: Assemble one of Barney's sculptures.
     * Richard Serra: Confront the sculptor tossing Vaseline.

   characters and myth=20

   Donkey Kong's myth of a man fighting a giant ape on a skyscraper has
   its origin in the King Kong films. After being captured in the jungle
   and brought to the city by greedy men, the largest ape in the world
   climbs the tallest building in New York where he fights humans to the
   death. Cremaster 3 is based on the Masonic myth of Hiram Abiff, the
   architect of Solomon's Temple. Barney uses the Chrysler Building as a
   character to play the temple.

   The construction worker Mario moves in pursuit of Pauline, while
   Barney's construction worker, the Entered Apprentice, climbs in
   pursuit of the architect, Hiram Abiff. Both workers are presented
with
   a single facial expression, no dialogue and no significant character
   development except their determination to move ever upwards.

   [barney.mario.jpg]

   The hubris of the Entered Apprentice and Mario is both awarded and
   punished. The ability to honor the rites is highly valued in Masonic
   culture. During his climb of the Chrysler Building, Barney's Entered
   Apprentice bypasses rites by casting rather than carving a Masonic
   stone. He is punished by having his teeth knocked out. By jumping for
   a hammer, Mario also gets the chance for an easier climb to the top.
   The hammer gives Mario the power to smash the barrels headed towards
   him. If he stays confident for too long, the hammer vanishes, leaving
   him dashing into the deadly barrels.

   Game designers populate levels with a higher concentration of
   adversaries than friends. These minor adversaries have varying
degrees
   of animosity towards the player. Upon the player's entrance to a new
   screen, level-specific characters charge immediately or wait for a
   trigger, which allows a player to observe sentries walking a beat,
   workers building, monsters feeding or shitting.

   The minor adversary plays an important role in Cremaster 3. With the
   camera disconnected from the Entered Apprentice, Barney allows the
   audience to observe ceremonies and rituals of level-specific
   characters, showing us what awaits the climber at the top of the
   Chrysler Building. These characters include a group of Freemasons
   smoking cigars, the Cloud Club Barman and Aimee Mullins playing the
   Entered Motivate.

   At the top of the Chrysler Building, the Entered Apprentice interacts
   with the Cloud Club Barman in silent-era comedy scene. Because of the
   tilted bar, representing the uneven structure of the unfinished
   temple, the Barman can't quite deliver a glass of beer to Barney
   without spilling it. Besides recalling the physical humor of Chaplin
   or Harold Lloyd, the scene evokes Tapper and Burger Time, funny, yet
   stressful early video games in which players faced the never-ending
   production of food and beverage.

   The rhythms of adversaries vary dramatically in Barney's Chrysler and
   Guggenheim sequences. Characters in the Chrysler sequence move slowly
   and deliberately, arranging things, cutting potatoes, smoking cigars.
   There is a feeling of the organic ritual operating in the world of
the
   late 1920s, bodies in synch with the turning wheels of industry. Even
   the dread evoked in the lobby by the 1967 Imperials smashing the 1938
   Imperial results from a precise rhythm and slow edits that give the
   viewer time to anticipate. In the Guggenheim sequence the absurd mix
   of adversaries are kicking, dancing and flailing. The atmosphere and
   tempo of the cast recall Fellini's Roma and Satyricon.

   [women.jpg]

   (fay wray, pauline, aimee mullins, hungry like the wolf)

   Model, athlete and double amputee Aimee Mullins plays the two primary
   female characters. Many early video games, including Donkey Kong,
also
   had singular female roles, where women played the fetishized captive,
   goal, and prize saved for the end of the game. Barney fixates on
   Mullins' truncated limbs, sculpting fetishes, elaborate prosthetic
   legs for her to wear.

   Barney dances with Mullins in the Guggenheim sequence, symbolizing
the
   moment at which the fetus becomes either male or female. She morphs
   into a feline and tussles with him, but he easily strikes her down.
   This sexy pussy that scratches clich=E9 takes form in a scene
   reminiscent of Duran Duran's "Hungry Like the Wolf" video. Undertones
   of bestiality are also significant in the King Kong films, but are
   stripped away by the primitive graphics and animation of Donkey Kong.

=20
[serra.kong1.jpg]

   Richard Serra plays Donkey Kong, waiting at the top of both New York
   buildings. Serra is one of the most famous living sculptors, a great
   white man from the previous century, Picasso-like in appearance,
gruff
   and bald. He maintains this persona playing two roles in the film.
   Both Barney and Serra are Yale alumni and, by placing him at the top
   of the order in both sequences, Barney makes it clear that he
   considers Serra the most important artist of the previous generation.
   With this casting, Barney praises Serra as Master Mason, but also
   winks at the art world's Warholian order of celebrity.

=20
[serra.kong2.jpg]

   In the Chrysler sequence Serra plays Hiram Abiff, the Architect of
   Solomon's Temple. He wears a sharp suit and waits at the top of the
   building drawing and constructing two pillars of black metal plates
(a
   reference to temple pillars Jachin and Boaz). In the Guggenheim
   sequence, Serra plays himself, donning an apron and tools with which
   to mold hot metals. While Donkey Kong tosses barrels at Mario that
   catch fire and populate the ramps with happy, dancing demons, Barney
   engages Frank Lloyd Wright's architecture with his own hot stuff.

   [serra.kong3.jpg]

   Richard Serra tosses melted Vaseline at the top level of the
   Guggenheim, which trickles down the rotunda. Vaseline is one of many
   materials, including tapioca, which Barney has become famous for
   using. The tossing is a reference to some of Serra's most important
   work. Using molten lead thrown against a wall, Serra performed the
   physical dance of Jackson Pollack's dripping and tossing, challenging
   the assumption that sculpture is a static object on a pedestal that
is
   separate from the space around it. Barney challenges the need a
   sculptor like Serra has to create any physical object, instead making
   his sculpture exist as characters in films. While Mario causes the
ape
   to fall several stories onto his head, Barney castrates his Donkey
   Kong, robbing the older artist of his material of choice.

   discount myths=20

   The art world has suffered a deficiency of myth in the past fifty
   years. Critics are both impressed and confounded by Matthew Barney as
   mythmaker. In an article titled "Strange Sensation" Time's Richard
   Lacayo calls Barney a "gee-whiz mythomaniac." "OK, it's weird,"
writes
   Jonathan Jones for the UK's Guardian. These critics are aware that
   Barney's film is inspired by the Hiram Abiff myth, but are swept away
   by fact that he dabbles in myth at all. They never refer to video
   games, where myths are a dime a dozen, where characters regularly
   morph shape and gender.

=20
[starwarscremaster.jpg]

   At the same time that they are overwhelmed by the films, critics have
   routinely panned the sculpture that Barney has created for the
   Cremaster series. Some snidely compare filling the Guggenheim with
   artifacts from the films to the "The Magic Of Myth" museum show of
   Star Wars costumes and props

   The Guggenheim exhibit allows Barney to show Cremaster 3 in the
   physical space in which the film was set; an opportunity never given
   to a game designer. Barney transforms the rotunda like a designer
   would. Flags and icons adorn different levels of the museum. Sounds
   echo through the spiraling chamber. A spaceship attached to the
   ceiling delivers scenes from Cremaster 3 on five video monitors. The
   exhibit feels like a visit to watch movies and play video games in
the
   finished basement of a wealthy childhood friend. The first gallery
has
   elaborate cases that Barney has designed for videodisc and DVD
   versions of the films. From these discs at the bottom level, up to
the
   giant fantasy television that dominates the top of the rotunda, the
   Cremaster exhibit is an exaltation of video, but without the game
   depicted in the film.

   Barney uses the building as an interface, confronting the Guggenheim
   with the goal of creating a single piece of art. Barney wants each
   piece of sculpture, each of video screen and the museum itself to
   organically fuse into one experience. The exhibit is another
masculine
   battle, an arm-wrestling match. Will Barney be able to reign in the
   landscape and make it work for the piece? The stakes are high: If the
   art merely reacts to the space it becomes decoration for the rotunda.

   The most significant thing Barney has changed in the museum is the
   light. A giant blue object covers the skylight of the building. In
the
   midday sun, this dims the light and casts a blue tinge. The blanket
of
   blue material is in the shape of the Cremaster logo.

   Both the film and exhibit are heavily branded. Like Freemasons, game
   designers and advertisers, Barney pays careful attention to logos,
   colors, flags and uniforms. During its three hours, the film
sometimes
   feels more like an advertisement for Barney's imagination than a
myth.
   The epic cinematography is not unlike Ridley Scott's famous 1984
   Macintosh television ad. We are hammered with serious faces and
   statuesque bodies. Shots of Barney climbing the elevator shaft could
   be adopted by a financial firm to advertise its perseverance. By
tying
   the disparate elements with the thread of ritual and mythology,
   Cremaster 3 is mythic without imparting an actual story.

   In both the film and the exhibit, this absence of story keeps the
   viewer at a distance. The film reaches its most visually luscious
   point with women in bunny suits kicking, two hardcore bands thrashing
   and Matthew Barney climbing, dancing and tumbling though the
   Guggenheim. It feels like watching a foreign sport that you do not
   know the rules of. Barney rejects the inviting qualities of film
   narrative and creates a virtual space between viewer and art that
   mimics the feeling of seeing a large piece of classical sculpture in
a
   museum. Don't get too close and don't touch. We aren't called to join
   the parade like we are in a Fellini film. We don't feel emotionally
   involved like we do in a good musical, action film or video game. We
   never get to play.

   Experiencing Cremaster 3 in the exhibit space of the Guggenheim
   bridges the distance between viewer and art, but there is also a
sense
   of loss. You are the Entered Apprentice moving up the ramps. You are
   in the landscape of the game, but there are no adversaries. It's like
   arriving to engage in LARP (live action role play), but finding
nobody
   dressed as alchemists and orcs. Even the Star Wars exhibit had
   mannequins dressed in costumes. Looking down from the top level of
the
   museum, you see no punk bands or dancers. You see no naked women
   frolicking in the fountain. What you see are museumgoers gawking up
at
   the video screens with their backs turned to the sculpture.

   While the film successfully alters the narrative landscape of the
   Guggenheim to inspire characters to dance, climb and interact with
   objects, the exhibit's use of the space obliterates the impulse to
   action. Watching Barney on a giant video monitor toss white plastic
   sculpture as you stand in the same space, next to the same objects
   does more than just distract you from the sculpture. It taunts you.
   The museum interface keeps your body still as the video images
   violently tease you with Barney's body in action. Kafka would have
   enjoyed this situation. Characters peek out from film stills on the
   walls, their stoic faces and muted voices whispering: Pick it up and
   throw it. At the same time the giant monitors scream at you: You are
   helpless. You cannot climb. You cannot pick up the objects. You
cannot
   throw them. You cannot be the epic hero. If you listen to Barney's
   characters, if the art inspires you to action, you will be thrown out
   on your ass to wander aimlessly around Central Park.

   Barney may have successfully re-imagined the Guggenheim in the film,
   but despite placing his logo over the building and changing its
light,
   despite the overwhelming combination of video and sculpture, the
   Cremaster exhibit fails to conquer the museum's interface.
   the future of video games and art

   A game adaptation of Cremaster 3 could include all of its characters,
   sculpture, mythical elements and action. You could climb the rotunda,
   pick up objects and toss them. You could confront punk rockers and
   legless felines. Why would a game designer want to create this game?
   The effort could be the first game recognized as a relevant piece of
   contemporary art. It could be more compelling than the film or the
   exhibit. It could even be a great game.

   The dialogue between those that create games and those that decide
   what is art has just started. Adaptation and the exchange of ideas
   will expand what is considered fine art and what is considered a
video
   game. The critical feedback that artists and cinematographers are
used
   to will force designers to view their work as part of the larger
   continuum of art. This will spawn some bloated egos and boring games,
   but a wider set of influences and greater personal responsibility
will
   inspire game designers to create engaging works of art that are also
   fun to play.

        The Cremaster films open today at the Castro Theatre in San
Francisco.

Hi all,  I'm pasting below a leter to the editor I just sent to the New Yorker
regarding Janet Malcolm's insipid piece on Gertrude Stein.  The "outing" of
Stein as a fascist sympathizer dispenses with all historical and personal
nuance (what must she think of Pound?!) and the discussion of Stein's writing
is completely idiotic.  I try to be a bit more politic in the letter itself but
that's the upshot.  If anyone else was as annoyed as I was reading this (I
could barely get through the damn thing) I'd encourage you to send your own
letter to themail@newyorker.com.  If enough people send they'll have to print
at least one I'd imagine.  Suddenly Alice Quinn's incomprehensible tenure as
Poetry Editor is starting to make more sense!   -m.

****************
Dear Editor,

Whatever useful biographical information is contained in Janet Malcolms
"Gertrude Steins War" (June 2nd) is marred by her bizarrely vindictive tone
and transparent dislike for Steins writing.  Malcolm describes Stein as simply
"oozing" the thousands of pages she produced over a lifetime, relying on a
classic misogynist stereotype regarding women writers (Hawthorne chose the word
"scribbling").  William Carlos Williams and Ralph Ellison considered her work
brilliant, as do a host of vital contemporary American poets including Susan
Howe, John Ashbery, Robert Creeley  and Harryette Mullen.  Malcolm simply lumps
all who appreciate Steins writing under the heading "new Stein critics," the
better to dismiss them summarily.  Surely the New Yorkers readers deserve
better than the facile innuendo and pop-psychologizing that mark this articles
every page.  Malcolm calls "the arrogant desire to impose a narrative on the
stray bits and pieces of a life" a "crucial biographers trait."  Well, Malcolm
certainly has this trait in spades.

Sincerely,

Michael Magee

Thanks for the thoughtful reply Steven.

I want to quickly say that "To be sure, observer and world are looped in the
most complex fashion" seems not so sure at all.  In fact the ULTIMATE nature
of the relationship or existence of the relationship between observer and
world is as intractable as intractability itself.  This subject is nothing
but a series of speculations without a simgle drop of falsifiability.

We frequently hear the following positions:

observer and reality are distinct
observer and reality are inseparable but language provides a distinction
there is no reality external to the observer
there are no observers or observations only one reality

and so on.

But all of them have this in common: none of them can be examined in terms
of knowledge.  Hell, they can't be understood very well at all when put in
the following context: they are, undoubtedly, all utterances, statements,
etc.   That's about all we know.  Their truth values, their certainties,
etc., simply cannot be accessed.  More precisely, I can't even be sure if
their truth values can be accessed, but no one would ever know.  Knowing
whether or not there is a reality external to me is on par with knowing
there is life after death.  It's something that is entirely unknowable.  It
makes for charlatanism, cults, protection from charges of fraud, and
wonderful tax breaks, but that's about it.

I keep going back to Borges' infinite library of Babel where people comb
through the infinite stacks looking for the ultimate book of truth.  Borges'
point is both simple and profound: assuming one of these people in the
infinite library found the ultimate book of truth, how would that person
KNOW he or she found the book of truth?  What about the next book, with one
changed letter?  Or the one on the next shelf, with one changed word?  Or
the book down the hall, with one different sentence?  Or the book that is
exactly the same but half of the statements are negated?

Borges realized what I think Spicer realized, that the ambiguity of the
statement that expresses the intractability also expresses the metatruth of
the situation and illustrates the impossibility of having any basis for
being so sure.  For Spicer, I think his intractable problem surrounded the
notion of self in particular.

And, me too Steven.  I also like to write about this sort of thing.  There's
quite a parallel between knowing the relationship between observer and
reality and knowing what happens after death: the fantasy of knowing the
unknowable pitted against the knowledge of the limits of the knowable.

So now I've said all of that, I have to retreat a little and say I do like
very much this concept of observer and reality looped together.  My own
solution has been to try, mainly through poems, of trying to take these
apparently divergent and contradictory metaphysical positions and adhere to
them at the same time.  I call this "the blessed contradiction."  Because it
is anything but blessed.  It's altogether maddening and unfathomable but at
once it feels full of awe and melancholy.

I mean, I just cannot escape the grip of Spicer's first poem from his
"Language"

This ocean, humiliating in its disguises
Tougher than anything.
No one listens to poetry.  The ocean
Does not mean to be listened to.  A drop
Or crash of water.  It means
Nothing.
It
Is bread and water
Pepper and salt.  The death
That young men hope for.  Aimlessly
It pounds the shore.  White and aimless signals.  no
one listens to poetry.

Or this from the "graphemics" section, number 6:


You flicker.
If I move my finger through a
        candleflame, I know that there
        is nothing there.  But if I hold my
        finger there a few minutes longer,
It blisters.
This is an act of will and the flame is
        is not really there for the candle, I
Am writing my own will.
Or does the flame cast shadows?
        At Hiroshima, I hear, the shadows
        of the victims were as is photographed
        into concrete building blocks.
Or does it flicker?  Or are we both
        candles and fingers?
Or do they both point us to the
        grapheme on the concrete wall--
The space between it
Where the shadow and the flame are one?



Importantly, the space between the grapheme and the wall itself is nothing,
zip.  So where the shadow and flame are one is, appropriately nowhere.  But
apparently a nowhere certainly worth writing about....


Thanks for the note.

Patrick

Subject:      gravity's elbow (language and world)


Every now and then this "language and world" thread comes around and I
always find myself tempted to try to say something about it (I haven't
seen everything that's been said this time around, but I'm thinking
particularly of the recent provocative exchange under the title "Astrology
and Science").  It seems to me that the fact that we shape our world
through language is indisputable, but it also seems to me that the matter
(have to get this pun out of my system at some point) becomes trickier
when we start trying to think about whether anything external to us exists
at all.  Quantum physics often pops up, as it has here, as a reminder that
the presence of the observer fundamentally influences, or even
constitutes, whatever we might want to call "reality."  And, of course,
there's also the question of perception itself, and the way our sensory
apparatus constructs our experience.  Linguistics, physics, biology-work
in all these disciplines (leaving out others, like philosophy) confronts
us with the constructed, the partial, the relative.  So why do I still
find myself resisting the strongest formulations of what I'll call by way
of shorthand the "languaged" view of reality?  I guess some part of me
still gets a charge out of Berkeley kicking that stone and saying to the
radical skeptic "I refute thee thus."  Of course the stone could be an
illusion:  B. could be floating in a pod in the matrix dreaming both
stones and kicks.  Nevertheless his body would be there, and if the AI's
wanted to keep him alive it would have to make concessions to that body's
biology, making sure it was fed (if only by that black soup simmered from
bodies of dead humans), and so on.  If be were dreaming an illusion, it
still wouldn't be an illusion with no rules, coming out of nowhere (how
did he come to dream about stones, not to mention legs and feet in the
first place?)  We are embodied, our intelligence is embodied, our brains
are embodied, and yes, this embodiment means that we construct the world
in a particular way.  But it also means that the world constructs us.
That our bodies (and so our intelligence, our language) have evolved under
particular conditions and constraints not of our making.  What are these
"conditions and constraints" if not external reality? [....]

Luciano Berio, 77, Composer of Mind and Heart, Dies
By PAUL GRIFFITHS

Luciano Berio, an Italian composer whose many compositions, ranging =20
from chamber music to large-scale orchestral works and from operas to =20
songs, combined innovative imagination and analytical depth with a =20
richly sensuous feeling for sound and form, died yesterday in Rome. He =20
was 77.

An outstanding orchestral and vocal composer who was perhaps most =20
remarked upon for his works with solo voice, he was especially known =20
during his long residence in New York City for conducting his own works =20
with the Juilliard Ensemble, which he founded.

Mr. Berio's love for music was exuberantly promiscuous, and it drew him =20
close to Italian opera (especially Monteverdi and Verdi), 20th-century =20
modernism (especially Stravinsky), popular music (the Beatles, jazz), =20
the great Romantic symphonists (Schubert, Brahms, Mahler) and folk =20
songs from around the world. All gave him models for original =20
compositions or arrangements, or for works that were neither entirely =20
new nor entirely old, works in which threads of the old could be =20
combined with new strands. An outstanding example is the middle =20
movement of his "Sinfonia" for orchestra and vocal octet (1968-9), =20
where the entire scherzo from Mahler's "Resurrection" Symphony rolls =20
along, supporting a tapestry of short quotations, new ideas and spoken =20
interjections. Even when his music is ostensibly original it conveys a =20
homage to the past. For him to write an opera, a concerto, a string =20
quartet or a piece for solo clarinet was to contribute to a tradition. =20
That did not mean following traditional forms, which would have been =20
far from his thinking. Rather, the piece would emerge and develop as if =20
it were a memory, evoking textures and situations from the past.

Mr. Berio was born on Oct. 24, 1925, into a musical family long =20
resident in the Ligurian coastal town of Oneglia. His grandfather was =20
his first teacher, and he grew up surrounded by chamber music. =20
Immediately after World War II he entered the Milan Conservatory, where =20
he studied composition with Giorgio Federico Ghedini, whose neo-Baroque =20
style was an early influence, along with the music of Stravinsky.

Among his fellow students was the American singer Cathy Berberian, whom =20
he married in 1950, and with whom he made frequent visits to the United =20
States, encountering a fellow Italian, Luigi Dallapiccola, at =20
Tanglewood and electronic music in New York. Under these influences he =20
entered the modernist stream with works like "Chamber Music" (1953), a =20
set of James Joyce songs he wrote for Ms. Berberian to sing with =20
clarinet, cello and harp.

A meeting with another Italian, Bruno Maderna, brought him to the =20
Darmstadt summer school, the annual meeting place in Germany for the =20
European avant-garde. He attended regularly between 1954 and 1959, and =20
so came to know Pierre Boulez, Karlheinz Stockhausen, Gyorgy Ligeti, =20
Mauricio Kagel among others. Contributing to their endeavors for =20
radical innovation, he produced his most complicated conceptions, =20
notably "Tempi Concertati" for flute, violin, two pianos and four =20
instrumental groups (1958-9).

Other works of this period include his first electronic pieces. He was =20
co-director with Maderna of a studio for electronic music at the Milan =20
station of Italian radio and produced one of the early classics of tape =20
music: "Thema (Omaggio a Joyce)" (1958), based on a recording of Ms. =20
Berberian's reading from Joyce's "Ulysses." In the same year, with =20
"Sequenza I" for flute, he instituted a series of solo studies, each =20
considering the history, performance style and aura of an instrument. =20
By the time of his death he had composed 14 such pieces, for most of =20
the standard Western instruments, including the human voice.

As patterns of virtuosity, these pieces often prompted elaboration. For =20
example, "Sequenza VI" (1967), which has a viola player scrubbing =20
vigorously at tremolo chords, generated in succession "Chemins II" for =20
the same viola player with nonet (1967), "Chemins III" for the viola =20
with orchestra (1967), "Chemins IIb" for small orchestra (1969), a =20
score from which the original solo viola has disappeared, and "Chemins =20
IIc" (1972), in which it has been replaced by a bass clarinet. Here Mr. =20
Berio was using his own music in the ways he often used others' music, =20
as material to be analyzed, explored, imitated and developed.

Meanwhile, he was pursuing his fascination with the human voice and =20
with the drama of song.

Mr. Berio's first composition for the theater, "Passaggio," had its =20
premiere at the Piccola Scala in Milan in 1963 and was a provocative =20
expression of its sole female character's subjection to social =20
pressures. Subsequently his dramatic works became more poetic than =20
political. "Laborintus II" (1965) is based on an anticapitalist poem by =20
his longstanding friend Edoardo Sanguineti, but the music provides a =20
gorgeous, dreamlike flow of imagery for voices and chamber orchestra, =20
more engulfing than supporting the reciter.

Between 1963 and 1971 Mr. Berio lived largely in New York with his =20
Japanese-American second wife, Susan. He taught at the Juilliard =20
School, where he founded the Juilliard Ensemble, and became more active =20
as a conductor. He wrote "Sinfonia" for Leonard Bernstein and the =20
Philharmonic, and his first full-scale opera, simply called "Opera," =20
for the Santa Fe Opera, which produced it in 1970.

In 1972 he returned to Italy, to a house on the edge of the hill town =20
of Radicondoli, near Siena. In the mid-70's he became a co-director of =20
Mr. Boulez's computer music institute in Paris, which he left in 1980 =20
to establish his own facility in Florence, Tempo Reale.

His biggest work of the decade after "Opera" was "Coro," for 40 singers =20
and 40 instrumentalists (1975-6), an interweaving of folksong-inspired =20
melodies with massive choral settings of words by Pablo Neruda, =20
contrasting individual freedom with oppressive authority. He then =20
returned to opera for two collaborations with Italo Calvino: "Una vera =20
storia," first performed in Florence in 1982, and "Un re in Ascolto," =20
written for the 1984 Salzburg Festival.

Both these works were, like "Opera," deconstructions of the genre. The =20
first part of "Una Vera Storia" is a theatrical analysis of Verdi's "Il =20
Trovatore," the second a new synthesis of the discovered =20
musical-dramatic elements. "Un re in Ascolto," which was given its =20
American premiere by the Lyric Opera of Chicago in 1996, reworks parts =20
of Shakespeare's "Tempest" in a form in which rehearsal, performance =20
and memory coalesce.

Narrative is still more dissolved in "Outis," first performed at La =20
Scala, Milan, in 1996. The opera is loosely based on the myth of =20
Odysseus and incorporates 20th-century images of assassination, exile =20
and genocide. "Cronaca del Luogo," performed at the 1999 Salzburg =20
Festival, was a return to the format of "Passaggio," with a single =20
female character but now representing the heroic women of the Hebrew =20
Bible.

The concern with Jewish subject matter in these later operas =E2=80=94 as=
 well =20
as in the magnificent "Ofanim" for instrumental groups, children's =20
voices, electronic resources and, again, a solo female vocalist =20
(1988-97) =E2=80=94 was stimulated by his third wife, the Israeli-born Ta=
lia =20
Packer Berio, who was as important an influence on the music he wrote =20
in his 60's and 70's as Berberian had been in his 20's and 30's. Ms. =20
Packer Berio created the libretto for "Cronaca del Luogo" and also drew =20
her husband's attention to the symphonic sketches by Schubert that he =20
used in "Rendering" for orchestra (1988-90).

Other late orchestral works, notably "Formazioni" (1985-7) and =20
"Concerto II" with solo piano (1988-90), show Mr. Berio's continuing =20
ability to find new ways for the orchestra to speak, vividly and =20
beautifully, while solo instruments went on having their say as he =20
extended the "Sequenza" series. But perhaps his most personal and =20
powerful achievements are works centered on a solo female voice, all =20
the way from "Chamber Music" to "Cronaca del Luogo": music that =20
celebrates an individual's capacity, even in an unhearing world, to go =20
on expressing pathos, love and imagination.

He is survived by Ms. Packer Berio, of Radicondoli and Florence, and by =20
two daughters, two sons and two grandchildren.

Yes, although it probably isn't a setting per se because it's purely
instrumental (Buchla synthesizer).

Great polyrhythmic section in the middle that did a wonderful job of

Thanks, Anastasios, so much for sharing, some of the Masonic underpinnings
of both Cremaster and the Chrysler building. During the Civil Rights
movements in the sixties, I always remember some blacks saying the Masons
and the Masonic Order were the real ones running the whole show from the
Feds on down to small town America. I never quite got it cause I did not
investigate. But I always wondered about the two characters from Mason
leadership who showed up for my  "34 degree Mason" grandfather's funeral an=
d
claim as much space and time as the preacher during which they invoked  som=
e
curious sounding and undecipherable invocations. (No they did not pull out
at the compass and the hammer from a leather carrying case and do a number
on the body in the open coffin).

However I think it important to say that Barney is taking the Masonic shtic=
k
(ritual game) and turning it upside down, unveiling and - in what is a
counter ritual - shaking out the darkness behind the complexities and
repressions in this Masonic (male) game. (I don't do Donkey Kong so I don't
know if DK has any of that kind of reverb). (Now there's a concept! New
poetry as "reverb" - instead of deadening or predictable "oldverb."!)

Maybe Barney is able to do - and in some sense "get away" with - what he
does because he never entirely separates from a kind of stage and level of
entertainment -  the circus clown that can both undress himself and the
crowd - warts and all - while at the same time use theatrical and
aesthetically entrancing visual  devices to keep everyone  awestruck,
disbelieving, while mixing up humor, beauty and horror - and still leave th=
e
stage strutting.=20

Is there a poetry current that is equal in repertoire and cultural ambition=
?
And does Barney read contemporary poets/novelists for influence? Or should
these even be questions?

Joel,

Do you posit any connections between your question below and the long thread
about the nature of reality to which we've been treated these last weeks?

That is, if external reality is totally a phenomenon of language, wouldn't
that, to some degree, deflect concern about it? After all, "countless
buildings, infrastructure, and cultural assets" . . . those are all just
words. "Eight to ten thousand Iraqi civilians . . ." but what is a civilian,
really? Perhaps they don't even really exist. Or the variant, we can never
*know* that they do . . . so let's just leave things to the professionals,
the warrior caste, the people in the know . . .

I don't want to seem like a complete philistine here, even though I probably
am. I think any thoughtful person realizes there's an issue here. It was
good to see those Spicer poems in Patrick's recent post, for example. But
what that work has always meant for me is that poets negotiate the
ever-shifting space between subject and object, word and reality -- that
that's our province, our fate, the waterfront we cover. It's not something
to argue about, particularly, it's something to explore. Words hold on to
the real, he said; they're no more useful in themselves than rope. That's
one way to put it.

But philosophical parlor games don't mirror the world I know. They have no
relevance to it. And Oppen quotes, Steve, are very much to the point. (So is
Eliot Weinberger's preface to the recent *Collected Poems* edited by Michael
Davidson.)

Charles Bernstein told me last month that recent conversations about the
relationship between poetry and politics reminded him of those in the 1930s.
That got me thinking about the famous dispute between Benjamin and Adorno,
which I'll summarize in another post. But for now, there might be any number
of reasons why the public at large aren't talking about the middle east any
more; the war, after all, is off their TV screens, not worthy of the May
sweeps (American Idol is more edifying than American Idolater). But for
poets not to be speaking about it . . . well, I couldn't say. Other than to
repeat what I said about ten days ago: that flood of poems against the war
had a short shelf life, partly because they weren't political. We don't even
know what a political poem is.

The Emperor recluded
to the Palace, to its glow
of innerness. The Court

servants woke, sensing
accusations of inaction.

'Not so' they cried out
at the hapless population

in words of proclamation.
Oh fuck, that rhymes, I thought

and what might have been
scattered like pigeons
over the mush of sky.

'Not I, not I' I claimed
as the shite fell

somewhat on my head
and his Highness settled

in comfort on his bed.

I suspect that the reason we're not talking about the war on the list is
not very mysterious--there's almost total agreement in this crowd, and
saying amen gets very boring. It also doesn't serve much purpose.

Is it in our minds every waking moment? Is it a constant source of
depression and consternation? I can't speak for others except those I in
fact speak with, but it is for me and those around me, and I assume it is
for most of those I can't speak for.

In the various ways one votes the votes of me and mine have been counted
and discounted. One goes on casting the vote in all those ways. meanwhile I
talk about other things except when there's a reason to talk about the war.

Shared anger I guess is like an open fire--comforting on a cold night. But
when the discussion is among ourselves it doesn't accomplishg much else.

beliefs.  In the new millenium, the prevailing view seems to ever=20
more closely reflect the "Washington consensus": that America can and=20
must bring democracy fashioned in its own image to a radically=20
reconfigured Middle East.  Blecher describes not only the=20
questionable logic that this new consensus entails and the=20
fundamentally contemptuous narrative of world history and culture=20
that it reflects.  He also shows that while those who have=20
articulated these views claim that the new era is marked by=20
unprecedented historical transformations that have altered the=20
international political climate -- September 11th being the clarion=20
call -- these same intellectuals and policy figures conceal what is=20
perhaps the most significant change: the American leadership's=20
willingness to invade, control and remake entire regions of the world=20
in the name of bringing "freedom."  This "imperial enthusiasm" is at=20
the heart of the recent political convergence of traditional liberals=20
and neo-conservatives; it is an attitude that informs what Blecher=20
describes as a new and deeply troubling iteration of the old=20
complicity between power and knowledge.  --LS]

March 2003

As the Bush administration struggled to find a justification for=20
launching an attack on Iraq, churning out sketchy intelligence=20
reports about Iraq's weapons of mass destruction and links with=20
al-Qaeda, Washington wordsmiths produced their own grist for the war=20
mill: the prospect of a democratic pax americana in the Middle East.=20
The importance of the pundits' contribution to the war machine should=20
not be underestimated. As the task of swaying public opinion grew=20
more difficult, rhetoric around freedom and democracy has become ever=20
more central. In the weeks after September 11, 2001, George W. Bush=20
did not talk of remaking the Middle East. But in successive State of=20
the Union addresses, commencement speeches, press conferences and=20
televised appeals to the nation, Bush showed increasing faith in the=20
ability of the US to extirpate tyranny and implant freedom in this=20
agonized region.

Presidents did not always profess belief in the region's democratic=20
potential, nor did the intellectuals who served them. At the time of=20
the 1991 Gulf war, shapers of public opinion such as Bernard Lewis=20
and Daniel Pipes toed the first Bush administration's line that=20
Washington should not aim to democratize the Middle East. But by the=20
leadup to the junior Bush's war on Iraq, the same thinkers and=20
pundits had reoriented their policy prescriptions, in many cases=20
directly contradicting their writings of a decade ago. Employing=20
their prodigious skills to trumpet the golden age of democracy, they=20
have set aside their former convictions to serve power.

The push for American Empire has arisen from the convergence of=20
diverse ideological streams. Reaganite neo-conservatives such as=20
William Kristol and Robert Kagan leveraged the language of national=20
security to ally themselves with unreconstructed Cold Warriors like=20
Donald Rumsfeld and Dick Cheney. Yet given the lukewarm popular=20
support for the war in Iraq, the march to war could not have=20
succeeded without the assistance of Establishment academics and=20
journalists such as Fouad Ajami and Thomas Friedman, whose mainstream=20
credentials legitimized the administration's agenda among those who=20
otherwise might have been opposed. Rooted in the language of national=20
security and democracy, American Empire has been enabled by a=20
convergence -- not the congruence -- of political agendas.=20
Neo-conservatives, traditional conservatives and plain old-fashioned=20
liberals have formed a coalition of Iraq hawks whose spilling of ink=20
has been but a pale precursor to the spilling of Iraqi blood.

Those Elusive Jeffersonians

The first Gulf war was fought with little optimism and no sense of=20
historical mission.  Democracy reigned triumphant, but not in the=20
Arab world. With the fall of the USSR and the Communist regimes of=20
Eastern Europe, the US won the Cold War not through invasion or=20
occupation, but through a long-term test of endurance. The eviction=20
of Iraq from Kuwait notwithstanding, US interests continued to be=20
served by Cold War strategy in the post-Gulf war Middle East.=20
Containment targeted Iran and Iraq. Belief in the importance of=20
regional policemen, rooted in the Nixon Doctrine, dictated alliance=20
formation. Stability was provided by Egypt, Israel, Turkey and Saudi=20
Arabia, their undemocratic features not only overlooked but=20
encouraged. These limited goals were reflected in Bush the Elder's=20
war aims: securing Saudi oil fields, reversing Iraqi aggression in=20
Kuwait and restoring Kuwait's ruling family.

The Middle East, it seemed, had been left out of the democratic=20
revolution. As Colin Powell, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff=20
under Bush the Elder, told a press briefing in 1992:

Saddam Hussein is a terrible person, he is a threat to his own=20
people. I think his people would be better off with a different=20
leader, but there is this sort of romantic notion that if Saddam=20
Hussein got hit by a bus tomorrow, some Jeffersonian democrat is=20
waiting in the wings to hold popular elections. (Laughter.) You're=20
going to get -- guess what -- probably another Saddam Hussein. It=20
will take a little while for them to paint the pictures all over the=20
walls again -- (laughter) -- but there should be no illusions about=20
the nature of that country or its society. And the American people=20
and all of the people who second-guess us now would have been=20
outraged if we had gone on to Baghdad and we found ourselves in=20
Baghdad with American soldiers patrolling the streets two years later=20
still looking for Jefferson. (Laughter.)

Disarming his audience with jocular racism, Powell expressed his=20
government's pessimism about bringing democracy to the Middle East.=20
Eleven years later, on the eve of a new Gulf war, Powell would say=20
that a US victory "could fundamentally reshape the Middle East in a=20
powerful, positive way,"[1] but in the early 1990s, the US=20
administration believed that democracy could be achieved only through=20
mass popular action. President Bush called on Iraqis to "take matters=20
into their own hands," encouraging them to do what peoples across=20
Eastern Europe had done to topple their own undemocratic regimes.=20
Prior to April 1991, even hawkish groups such as the Committee for=20
Security and Progress in the Gulf -- a forerunner to the group of the=20
same name formed in 1998 -- limited their agendas to reversing the=20
Iraqi invasion of Kuwait. Then the brutal repression of Kurdish and=20
Shi'i rebellions convinced the neo-conservative wing of the=20
Republican Party of the necessity of overthrowing Saddam Hussein. In=20
April 1991, a spate of editorials and op-eds in the Wall Street=20
Journal urged the US to intervene to protect the Shi'a and Kurds. The=20
importance of regime change was articulated as a moral necessity, yet=20
today's shapers of public opinion had little to say about democracy=20
per se.

Democracy did not figure high on the list of US priorities for most=20
of the past decade. One could argue, in fact, that the Middle East=20
became a good deal less democratic over these years. Jordan and Egypt=20
reversed the limited democratic reforms they had instituted in the=20
1980s. After Islamists won the 1992 vote in Algeria, the ruling party=20
canceled the elections, leading to a bloody civil war. In Palestine=20
Yasser Arafat, with the support and encouragement of Israel and the=20
United States, set up a nightwatchman quasi-state that spent more=20
than one third of its budget on the police and security apparatus.=20
The "Damascus spring" that followed the death of Syrian President=20
Hafiz al-Asad in June 2000 has morphed into a bitter cold winter of=20
despair. The hints in the early 1990s that the Saudi monarchy would=20
implement democratic reforms, including a consultative council,=20
evaporated; the regime, in the face of mounting internal criticism,=20
repressed dissent even more brutally. Faced with similar pressures,=20
until quite recently the ruling family in Bahrain also refused to=20
open its political system, kicking off a period of civil unrest.=20
Yemen endured a civil war, which ended with the occupation of the=20
south by the north under the guise of unification. In the 1999=20
election, Yemeni president Ali Abdallah Salih supposedly garnered=20
more than 96 percent of the vote -- a margin that is relatively low=20
by the standards of the region, where elections have become an index=20
of repression, not choice.

Perhaps the most egregious example is Kuwait. After promising=20
democratic reforms in return for the US backing, the Al Sabah family=20
failed to reinstate the constitution, delayed elections for the=20
National Assembly and still does not permit women to vote. When=20
questioned about the ruling family's poor record, Bush retorted, "The=20
war wasn't fought about democracy in Kuwait." Privately, the Kuwaitis=20
were getting the same message.  Nazir Al Sabah, the Kuwaiti=20
ambassador, reported: "I saw the president the other day on Friday=20
(June 7, [1991]) and he walked up to me in the White House and said:=20
'Listen, Mr. Ambassador, we didn't fight this war for democracy or=20
those [war] trials. Don't be intimidated by what's going on.'"[2]=20
Deputy Assistant Secretary of State David Mack found himself turning=20
verbal somersaults to avoid calling for democracy, instead calling=20
upon Kuwait's rulers to "maximize internal political participation in=20
accordance with all traditional institutions."[3]

James Schlesinger, a former defense secretary, forthrightly summed up=20
the US position on democracy in the Middle East: "Do we seriously=20
want to change the institutions of Saudi Arabia? The brief answer is=20
no; over the years we have sought to preserve these institutions,=20
sometimes in preference to more democratic forces coursing throughout=20
the region. King Fahd [of Saudi Arabia] has stated quite=20
unequivocally that democratic institutions are not appropriate for=20
this society. What is interesting is that we do not seem to=20
disagree."[4]

Same Pipes, Different Tune

Today's Iraq hawks agreed fully with the administration's position.=20
Soon after the invasion of Kuwait in August 1990, they warned that=20
democracy was unlikely to come to the Middle East. Daniel Pipes,=20
director of the Middle East Forum and founder of Campus Watch, a=20
website dedicated to policing academics who study the Middle East,=20
pushed the line that Hussein's successor would be someone in the=20
military. Succession would be based on power, not principles, leading=20
Pipes to echo Bush's position that a "stable, defensible and=20
non-bellicose" Iraq was the best conceivable outcome.[5] Democracy=20
did not figure in the equation. If the Iraqi regime was to be=20
overthrown, it would be through a popular uprising, not foreign=20
intervention: "It is now up to the Iraqis themselves to dispose of=20
Saddam Hussein and his evil clique." Such a result was likely, Pipes=20
thought.  On the first anniversary of the Gulf war, Pipes incorrectly=20
predicted, "Desert Storm is likely to lead to Saddam's eventual=20
overthrow."[6]

Like Colin Powell, Pipes in late 1991 preferred to see Saddam Hussein=20
remain in power:

Iraqis, their neighbors and the outside world have all been served=20
reasonably well by the delicate balance of power of the past nine=20
months which leaves Iraq neither too strong nor too weak. And we=20
still are. Yet this balance is a one-time thing; when undone, it is=20
permanently gone. Now, as then, getting rid of Saddam increases the=20
prospects of Iraqi civil war, Iranian and Syrian expansionism,=20
Kurdish irredentism and Turkish instability. Do we really want to=20
open these cans of worms?

The only way to avoid these consequences of toppling Hussein,=20
according to Pipes, was "a very intrusive and protracted US military=20
presence in Iraq." He counseled against such a course:

And here we revert to last year's dilemma: after American forces=20
directly unseat Saddam and occupy Iraq, what next? There were no good=20
answers to this question in 1990, and there are none today. If the=20
administration calculates costs, it will reach the same prudent=20
conclusion it reached early in 1991: don't stimulate regional havoc,=20
don't take direct responsibility for deciding the future of Iraq and=20
don't risk losing American lives -- probably many more than were lost=20
in Desert Storm -- on behalf of vague and undefined aims. We all want=20
Saddam gone; but unless Americans are prepared for an unlimited=20
occupation of Iraq, we'd do better letting the Iraqis get rid of=20
him.[7]

Given this persuasive case against occupying Iraq, one could easily=20
mistake Pipes for an anti-war activist. It was not, however, a sense=20
of solidarity with the Iraqi people that motivated these sentiments,=20
as the following calumny reveals:

[The Middle East] is also a region which marches to its own beat, and=20
nearly immune to such happy global developments as democratization,=20
increased respect for human rights and greater scope for the=20
market.... Details shift but the basic picture remains surprisingly=20
stagnant.

Americans should learn to keep their aspirations modest when it comes=20
to the Middle East. With the exception of the Middle East's two=20
democracies, Turkey and Israel, Washington should keep its distance.=20
To get too involved permits the misdeeds and failures of others to=20
become our own. Our will and our means are limited: we probably=20
cannot reconstruct Iraq as we did Japan or Germany. Nor is our=20
example likely to prevail; Egyptians and Saudis have little use for=20
our political system.

The Daniel Pipes of 1992 is characterized by an unmitigated pessimism=20
about the prospects for Middle East democracy. Even Germany and=20
Japan, which later would become examples of successful US=20
nation-building, are inappropriate models for "stagnant" Arab=20
societies mired in the past. For all its strength, US power was seen=20
as limited, to be used sparingly, in a region that had been bypassed=20
by the New World Order:

This is not a call for disengagement, much less isolationism. As in=20
the case of Iraqi aggression, the US government should use its=20
influence to address specific problems: the security of Israel, the=20
stability of moderate Arab regimes, the free-flow of oil, and the=20
suppression of terrorism. But it must know its limits and not believe=20
that the region is amenable to improvements along American lines.[8]

A decade after the 1991 Gulf war, Pipes has radically changed his=20
tune. Abandoning his previous concerns about the complications that=20
would arise from a US occupation of Iraq, he urged George W. Bush to=20
move on Baghdad: "the risks are overrated."[9] In 2002, on MSNBC's=20
"Buchanan and Press," he directly contradicted his earlier comments=20
about the potential for Arab democracy: "It's in our interests that=20
they modernize and it's in our interests to help them modernize and I=20
think we know how. We are very modern and we can help them. Look,=20
we've done that elsewhere. Look, for example, at Japan. We defeated=20
the Japanese and then we guided them towards a democracy. We did the=20
same with Germany. We should be doing the same thing with Iraq."=20
Japan and Germany suddenly have become viable models for the region=20
to emulate. The US occupation of Iraq might not be so bad, since the=20
US now has the opportunity to "modernize" the Middle East, or in=20
terms of what Pipes rejected in 1992, the region now seems to be=20
"amenable to improvements along American lines." The US-led New World=20
Order has finally made it to the Middle East: "The United States=20
cannot pass up a unique chance to remake the world's most politically=20
fevered region."[10] Pipes has become a supporter of American Empire.

Same Hama, Different Rules

Pipes is not the only figure to have reversed himself. Thomas=20
Friedman, journalist and self-appointed itinerant ambassador,=20
established his credentials as a Middle East expert with his first=20
book, From Beirut to Jerusalem. Therein he coined the term "Hama=20
rules" (referring to Hafiz al-Asad's bloody repression of Islamist=20
revolts in the Syrian city of Hama) to describe the guiding principle=20
of politics in the Middle East: rule or die. This truculent logic=20
informed his take on the Gulf war of 1990-91, which he saw as a=20
mechanism to restore the status quo: "This war was not about=20
healing.... This war was never about competing visions for the future=20
of the Arab world. It was about a thief who had to be stopped."[11]=20
By 2003, he had decided the US was powerful enough to break the hold=20
of Hama rules and create real change in the Middle East: "[O]ur kids=20
will have a better chance of growing up in a safer world if we help=20
put Iraq on a more progressive path and stimulate some real change in=20
an Arab world that is badly in need of reform."[12]

Or take Richard Haass, director of the State Department's Policy=20
Planning Staff. In 1997, he described the notion that the US would be=20
the world's only great power as "beyond our reach.... It simply is=20
not doable." In terms of democracy, he stated forthrightly: "Primacy=20
cannot be confused with hegemony. The United States cannot compel=20
others to become more democratic."[13] By 2002, he had become a=20
spokesman for what the US could do instead of what it could not do to=20
spread democracy: "By failing to help foster gradual paths to=20
democratization in many of our important relationships -- by creating=20
what might be called a 'democratic exception' -- we missed an=20
opportunity to help these countries became more stable, more=20
prosperous, more peaceful and more adaptable to the stresses of a=20
globalizing world. It is not in our interest -- or that of the people=20
living in the Muslim world -- for the United States to continue this=20
exception. US policy will be more actively engaged in supporting=20
democratic trends in the Muslim world than ever before."[14]

Intellectuals who made their reputation within the academy have been=20
no more consistent. Take, for instance, Fouad Ajami. In 1990, Ajami=20
railed against the prospect of the US bringing democracy to the=20
Middle East: "The US is in the Gulf to defend order.... We're not=20
there to impose our rules. The injection of questions of democracy=20
into the debate is completely inappropriate."[15] Yet 13 years later,=20
he advocates precisely such an injection. In a  recent article in=20
Foreign Affairs, Ajami rejects the restraint with which the US=20
conducted itself in 1991, arguing that the "dread of=20
'nation-building' must be cast aside." Ajami throws in his lot with=20
those who "envisage a more profound American role in Arab political=20
life: the spearheading of a reformist project that seeks to modernize=20
and transform the Arab landscape. Iraq would be the starting point,=20
and beyond lies an Arab political and economic tradition and culture=20
whose agonies and failures have been on cruel display." As with=20
Pipes, the rehabilitation of Japan gives Ajami hope that an "opening=20
for democracy" is emerging in the Middle East: "The theatrics and=20
megalomania of Douglas MacArthur may belong to a bygone age, but Iraq=20
could do worse than having the interim stewardship of a modern-day=20
high commissioner who would help usher it toward a normal world."=20
While the advertising consultants try to steer the US administration=20
away from the language of empire, intellectuals are not constrained=20
by marketing strategies. Ajami's rhetoric confirms that the Mandate=20
-- the internationally sanctioned occupation of the inter-war period=20
that aimed to "raise up subject peoples" -- is the imperial form of=20
choice for Iraq.[16]

"Bernard Has Taught Us How"

Bernard Lewis rejects Ajami's open invocation of empire, yet his=20
writings mesh with the American imperial agenda. Overall, Lewis has=20
evinced a remarkable continuity over his half-century career, yet on=20
the narrow issue of what the US can do to remake the Middle East, he=20
too seems to have shifted his position over the past decade. In 1990,=20
laying the roots for Samuel Huntington's later work, Lewis wrote the=20
world faced a "clash of civilizations" that pitted "Judeo-Christian"=20
against "Muslim" culture. Islam was not monolithic, Lewis was quick=20
to point out, as "fundamentalism" was only one of many Islamic=20
traditions: "There are others, more tolerant, more open, that helped=20
to inspire the great achievements of Islamic civilization in the=20
past, and we may hope that these other traditions will in time=20
prevail." It is specifically violent Islam that has shaped Lewis'=20
recent cultural theorizing and authorizes his prescriptions for US=20
policy, yet he was more catholic in presenting the dilemmas that=20
confronted the region in the wake of the 1991 Gulf war: "[T]here will=20
be a hard struggle, in which we of the West can do little or nothing.=20
Even the attempt might do harm, for these are issues that Muslims=20
must decide among themselves."[17]

Decide among themselves. This rhetoric of choice has been a=20
consistent feature of Lewis's thought for more than 50 years, dating=20
to his first monograph, The Arabs in History. In 1950, Lewis wrote=20
that Arabs, faced with "problems of readjustment," had three choices:=20
taking on some version of "modern civilization," rejecting "the West=20
and all its works, pursuing the mirage of a return to the lost=20
theocratic ideal" or "renewing their society from within, meeting the=20
West on terms of equal cooperation." Over the next four decades, the=20
Arabs did not live up the hope Lewis had placed in them, but the Gulf=20
war seemed to widen the space for the Arabs to make the right choice.=20
In the rebellion of the Kurds and the Shi'a, he saw the possibility=20
of a new age:

It may turn out that the civil war that destroyed Lebanon was a pilot=20
project for the whole region, and that with very few exceptions=20
states will disintegrate into a chaos of squabbling, fighting sects,=20
tribes and regions.... Or it may be that the peoples of the region=20
will free themselves at last from the politics of bribery, cajolery,=20
blackmail and force, and find their way to the freer and better life=20
to which they have so long aspired. The important change is that the=20
choice is now their own.[18]

Even as Saddam Hussein slaughtered the Kurds and Shi'a, Lewis=20
retained his conviction that only the peoples of the region could=20
remake their future: "For the first time in more than two centuries,=20
this choice is entirely their own.... Those who care about the Middle=20
East and its peoples can only hope that they will choose well and=20
soon."[19]

Today, Lewis is still waiting for the Arabs to figure it out. His=20
recent bestseller, What Went Wrong?, like his The Middle East: A=20
Brief History of the Past 2,000 Years, presents a familiar choice:

If the peoples of the Middle East continue on their present path, the=20
suicide bomber may become a metaphor for the whole region, and there=20
will be no escape from a downward spiral of hate and spite, rage and=20
self-pity, poverty and oppression, culminating sooner or later in yet=20
another alien domination.... If they can abandon grievance and=20
victimhood, settle their differences, and join their talents,=20
energies, and resources in a common creative endeavor, than they can=20
once again make the Middle East, in modern times as it was in=20
antiquity and the Middle Ages, a major center of civilization. For=20
the time being, the choice is their own.[20]

The rhetoric of choice implies agnosticism about what the future=20
holds. As Lewis wondered during the 1991 Gulf war, "Will there be=20
more of the same, or can one really hope for democratization in the=20
Arab world?"[21] This agnosticism, however, is disingenuous because=20
it is embedded in a historical narrative that removes the uncertainty=20
that lies at the root of any real question. The narrative of his book=20
-- in fact, his entire oeuvre -- updates "decline theory," that is,=20
the notion that the Ottoman Empire was once a great civilization but=20
began a steady and uninterrupted decline in the sixteenth century.=20
Lewis extends this methodology from Ottoman history into the popular=20
realm, showing how Arab "problems of readjustment" (1950) or their=20
"spiral of hate and rage" (2003) stem from their inability to cope=20
with the modern world. This overarching trajectory removes the=20
uncertainty that Lewis affects; it is not a question of his=20
earnestness, but rather the pessimism that suffuses his writing. He=20
would have us believe that history is bi-directional, but the inertia=20
of his narrative runs in one direction only. Without someone or=20
something to arrest the decline, his structure -- if not his words --=20
tell us that the Middle East is destined only for more of the same.

Enter imperial America and it neo-conservative architects. US=20
hegemony, for Lewis, offers the hope of rescuing a fallen people from=20
their state of degradation. Not only will the US promote values of=20
freedom and democracy; it promises salvation as the one power that=20
can stand against the inexorable historical trajectory that is=20
pulling the Middle East downward. George W. Bush recently articulated=20
this historical mission: "We meet here during a crucial period in the=20
history of our nation and of the civilized world. Part of that=20
history was written by others; the rest will be written by us."[22]=20
Theorists of decline such as Lewis could not agree more. As they=20
would have it, ever since Ottoman vitality petered out four centuries=20
ago, the West has provided the ideas, inspiration and means to move=20
the Middle East into the modern world. Left to their own devices,=20
Arabs are destined to remain in the misery they have chosen for=20
themselves. This explains why Lewis wrote in 1996 -- when internal=20
opposition constituted the only possible path to toppling Hussein --=20
that "in Iraq and Syria, an overthrow of the present dictators is=20
unlikely to lead to the immediate establishment of a workable=20
democracy."[23]

The neo-conservatives, for their part, appreciate Lewis since he=20
provides more than just an air of academic respectability for the=20
administration's program. He offers a raison d'etre for US hegemony=20
in the Middle East. Paul Wolfowitz, the administration's main=20
proponent for toppling Saddam Hussein, told a conference in Tel Aviv,=20
"Bernard has taught [us] how to understand the complex and important=20
history of the Middle East and use it to guide us where we will go=20
next to build a better world for generations."[24] In 1998, Lewis=20
signed an open letter to President Bill Clinton that called for the=20
toppling of Saddam Hussein with a massive bombing campaign and, if=20
need be, ground troops. Co-signers included not only the=20
neo-conservative pundits William Kristol and Robert Kagan, and the=20
=FCber-hawk Richard Perle, but also Bush appointees who have shaped the=20
administration's policy: Elliott Abrams, Richard Armitage, John=20
Bolton, Douglas Feith, Zalmay Khalilzad, Donald Rumsfeld and Paul=20
Wolfowitz.

These blossoming links explain why Lewis was invited to participate=20
in a meeting of the Defense Advisory Board on September 19, 2001 and=20
subsequent meetings with Bush and Cheney. Lewis won't say what was=20
discussed at these meetings, but they are said to have been=20
influential in promoting Wolfowitz's agenda to attack Iraq.[25] One=20
report characterized Lewis as endorsing the line that the US "was=20
guilty of 'betrayals'" of the Iraqi people when it failed to support=20
their uprisings in both 1991 and 1995. He promoted the Iraqi=20
oppositional groups as viable, as the best hope for stable democracy=20
in the Middle East.[26] He told Bush and Cheney, like other=20
officials, that the time had come to act for the peoples of Iraq.[27]=20
By late 2002, as the US war machine was gearing up, he told a=20
conference at AEI that he is "cautiously optimistic" about the=20
prospect for developing a democratic regime in Iraq.[28] Elsewhere,=20
he declared himself "very optimistic" about a post-war Iraq:

I think Iraq in many way is the most advanced, most developed of the=20
Arab countries.... Although all this has suffered terrible damage at=20
the hands of Saddam Hussein, it has not been entirely destroyed. I=20
see the possibility of a genuinely enlightened and progressive and --=20
yes, I will say the word -- democratic regime arising in a=20
post-Saddam Iraq.[29]

Lewis has remained consistent in his assessment that even the most=20
optimistic of scenarios will come to pass slowly. In 1996, he wrote:=20
"Democracy cannot be born like Aphrodite from the sea foam. It comes=20
in slow stages."[30] More recently, he said that the US cannot simply=20
install an American-style democracy; it is "unrealistic" to think=20
that a political system can be engineered overnight, especially if it=20
appears to be the result of "forced change by an external force."[31]=20
Today, however, the US can create the conditions under which Iraqi=20
and Middle Eastern peoples might make, at long last, the correct=20
choice. US tutelage will arrest their centuries-long period of=20
decline and restore the grandeur of antiquity. For the Lewis of 2003,=20
unlike the Lewis of 1990, the West has an active role to play in this=20
process. The agnostic has become a believer.

Making the Right Choice

Like the stewards of American policy, Lewis thinks that political=20
culture can be remade by simply opening the playing field and=20
allowing Iraqis to make the right choice. While some in the State=20
Department do not find the democracy domino theory credible,[32] the=20
neo-conservatives have been assuming that once Iraq gets on the right=20
track, other countries will hop on the democratic bandwagon. Choice,=20
however, has not always been a viable mechanism for change, since at=20
certain moments when peoples of the Middle East have made choices --=20
in Iran in 1953, for example -- the US forcibly reversed them. The=20
rhetoric of choice obscures the fact that US policy will necessarily=20
involve the use of military might. Administration officials have=20
spoken only vaguely about their plans for specific countries, but=20
when they do, one gets the feeling that the spread of democracy might=20
not be smooth as their optimistic rhetoric implies. When=20
Undersecretary of State John Bolton found himself in front of a=20
friendly crowd in Israel, for instance, he proclaimed with=20
uncharacteristic forthrightness "that he has no doubt America will=20
attack Iraq, and that it will be necessary to deal with threats from=20
Syria, Iran and North Korea afterwards."[33] Democracy, it seems,=20
will grow out of the barrel of a gun.

Yet even once the democratic "choice" is made, US interests will not=20
be assured, since new democratic polities could disregard US cues.=20
French and German democracy has not been a great boon to the current=20
administration. Iraq's non-democratic neighbors are providing the=20
greatest assistance to the US, whereas relatively democratic Turkey=20
has caused consternation among Washington planners. Even beyond the=20
war, continued US support for Israel, demands for basing rights and=20
efforts to extract greater oil profits could inflame public opinion,=20
which in turn would produce restraints on governmental cooperation.=20
At the very least, a government accountable to its people would=20
demand concessions from the US in exchange for cooperation, which is=20
perhaps why Douglas Feith recommended to an AEI conference in 1998=20
that the US push a notion of democracy built around limited=20
government and personal freedoms, not majority rule.[34] Bernard=20
Lewis is similarly apprehensive about democracy running amok. While=20
he rails against the "deep-seated, insidious prejudice...[that] Arabs=20
are incapable of democratic institutions," he nevertheless cautions=20
that "we should be realistic in our expectations. Democracy is strong=20
medicine, which has to be administered in small gradually increasing=20
doses otherwise you risk killing the patient"; Hitler, after all,=20
came to power "in a free and fair election."[35] Lewis worries that=20
that democracy will give Arabs the chance to choose wrongly,=20
disappointing him once again, as they have done repeatedly over his=20
career. For Feith and Lewis, democracy needs to be scaled back, lest=20
the US actually get the robust democracy that the Bush administration=20
claims to want.

Conservative intellectuals in the US, for their part, have not=20
hesitated to make the right choice, allying themselves with US=20
Empire. They have recently attacked the field of Middle East Studies=20
for failing to pay homage to the "essentially beneficent role in the=20
world" that the US plays.[36] In dubbing the entire field a=20
"failure," servants of empire such as Martin Kramer have implied that=20
scholarship on the Middle East is of value only inasmuch as it=20
supports US policy. By this standard, the Iraq hawks have succeeded=20
mightily. Accommodating themselves to the political fashion of the=20
day, they have prioritized political expediency over intellectual=20
rigor and consistency. Middle East academics have been accused of=20
"groupthink" and illegitimately politicizing their scholarship, but=20
ironically, it is the Iraq hawks whose work is politicized in the=20
most literal sense, reflecting policy groupthink and the Washington=20
consensus. Are Japan and Germany suitable models for reconstructing=20
Iraq? Is the "injection of the question of democracy" in the Middle=20
East appropriate? Is the region "amenable to improvements along=20
American lines"? Can the US military create the conditions for=20
democracy? The Iraq hawks now answer these questions in the=20
affirmative even though very little has changed in the region to give=20
hope to the partisans of democracy.

Much has changed elsewhere, of course. The murder of over 3,000=20
civilians on September 11 gave renewed impetus to American hegemony=20
and stripped away the public's hesitation to project force around the=20
globe. It is this change that accounts for the consensus that=20
includes establishment commentators and neo-conservative=20
rabble-rousers. As they would have it, the potential for=20
democratization has arisen from the fortuitous coincidence of Saddam=20
Hussein's obstinacy and American beneficence. Leaving aside the=20
question of US intentions, this formulation omits a third aspect of=20
the current historical conjuncture: the newfound American willingness=20
to occupy nations and remake them in its image. The US has used force=20
on previous occasions to overthrow governments. What distinguishes=20
the current moment -- and the Iraq hawks' about-face since the 1991=20
Gulf war -- is the apparent zeal to inculcate a new set of political=20
and cultural sensitivities among an entire people. This imperial=20
enthusiasm is specious, however, in that talk of democracy is little=20
more than a mechanism for creating compliant states that will=20
"choose" to further US interests. As the US military has wielded its=20
weapons in the service of American Empire, so too have its=20
intellectual boosters.

Talk about "vaporware" ,in today's London's Independent:

Intelligence leaves no doubt that Iraq continues to possess and conceal
lethal weapons
George Bush, Us President 18 March, 2003

We are asked to accept Saddam decided to destroy those weapons. I say that
such a claim is palpably absurd
Tony Blair, Prime Minister 18 March, 2003

Saddam's removal is necessary to eradicate the threat from his weapons of
mass destruction
Jack Straw, Foreign Secretary 2 April, 2003

Before people crow about the absence of weapons of mass destruction, I
suggest they wait a bit
Tony Blair 28 April, 2003

It is possible Iraqi leaders decided they would destroy them prior to the
conflict
Donald Rumsfeld, US Defence Secretary 28 May, 2003

I guess what's most depressing - from the point of view of being a citizen -
is that we in the hands of language manipulated and directed by what amounts
to an evangelical coup in which some odd concept of the grail can only be
achieved by enormous repressive power veiled in textual deception (i.e.,
blatant lies).
I don't think it's worthwhile to beat each other up for being more
politically impotent than the next person.  Iraq seems clearly on the way to
becoming a U.S led police state disaster.  My suspicion is that the Peace
Movement - national and international  - is just beginning to move again (in
horror at facts on both domestic and Iraqi ground) and things are going to
inevitably crack open.  A knee-jerk pacifism - that easily blinds itself and
folds up shop - is the most immediate enemy to this process.  The making of
poems -moving forward - may be entirely an after thought. Or what springs up
as a consequence taking stands. Though - here on the West Coast - many poets
and artists were conscientious objectors during world war II (and wrote and
published in the US detention camps) their work did not really flourish
until after the war, as the work of many others in the late forties.

Old enough to be a little patient - tho frustrated - here!

Consider the Poet

who walks in a stony field behind his plow
turning up old flints
adze-heads and the bones of ptarmigan,
who lives in terror of tea-leaves
ink-blots and mendicant feathers,
who spends his tears on jujubes,
and on feast-days
pulls coins from dirty ears
to the applause of grass-blades;

whose overcoat is specked with the dandruff
of alphabets; a salamander
born in the hospitable lava, he
traffics in scoriac mysteries
and scalds the hands of those
who put trust in him:

Arbiter of waters, Nuncio of the wild iris,
Ishmaelite among the tenements of eyes,
you salute each morning the flags
which flutter in the cottonwoods
and bear in your lung the deadly flower
of recollection.

though I am not  proponent of queer marriage (the terms does not seem
to coincide) nonetheless, to restrict ones right to practice what ever
simplistic  and silly ritual one chooses is like restricting one from
"walking in the park," entering certain shops, or having to go the the
back of the bus speak. this all has an air of apartheid, and in this
country there is this constant push wether through legesative means,
the military or overt hatered a constant battle line. in San Francisco
alone last year there was 270 hate crimes. I do not know what the rest
of the country is like, but I do know this is suppose to be a city of
tolerance. and this is not just a national practice there is still the
round ups and imprisonment of gay men in egypt, a Hijra was refused the
right to hold office in India because the counts decide what gender the
individual was, and the office was for a woman... its time to face up
to the fact that what is going on with the bush's international policy
is being reflected onto queers and little or nothing is said about
it... which all seems a little to easy and privileged....

Gay marriage ban reintroduced in HouseAnn Rostow, Gay.com /
PlanetOut.com Network
Wednesday, May 28, 2003 / 04:45 PM


The Human Rights Campaign lashed out at the authors of an anti-gay
constitutional amendment Wednesday, calling the Federal Marriage
Amendment a "divisive and discriminatory" attempt to "treat one group
of citizens differently than everybody else."

Introduced May 21 in the U.S. House of Representatives for the second
year in a row, the amendment seeks to embed a ban on same-sex marriage
into the text of the U.S. Constitution. If passed, it would signal the
end of all efforts to legalize same-sex relationships, as well as a
permanent prohibition on granting gay couples "the legal incidents" of
marriage.

The Federal Marriage Amendment is arguably a last gasp of conservative
Christians, who are fighting a losing battle against the rise of gay
and lesbian families and their increasing status in society. A recent
Gallup poll suggested 6 in 10 Americans support giving legal rights to
same-sex couples.

In June or July, the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court will rule on
the legalization of same-sex marriage, or perhaps civil unions, in the
Bay State. Gay activists have their fingers crossed that the justices
will issue a favorable opinion. In New Jersey, a similar right-to-marry
case will be argued in a lower court next month.

Legal marriages for same-sex couples in Belgium will begin June 16 of
this year. And the leaders of four out of five of Canada's main
political parties issued statements Tuesday, urging the federal
government to legalize same-sex marriage in view of three recent
provincial court decisions.

Although 37 states have passed "Defense of Marriage Acts," designed to
protect states from having to recognize a legal gay marriage from
outside state borders, most legal analysts from the right and the left
believe that these laws will one day be deemed unconstitutional.
Without a new amendment to the U.S. Constitution, it seems clear that
states must respect the "public acts, records and judicial
proceedings," of every other state, a mandate that would apply to the
recognition of a Boston marriage, or a Newark, N.J., one.

On Tuesday, Texas Gov. Rick Perry signed a Defense of Marriage Act into
law, adding the Lone Star State to the list of those with anti-marriage
statutes.

Passage of a new constitutional amendment is a nearly impossible feat.
An amendment must first pass a joint session of Congress by a
supermajority of two-thirds. Then, the amendment must be ratified by
the legislatures of 38 states within 10 years. Since the repeal of
prohibition, the Constitution has been amended just six times, while
hundreds of proposals have died along the long road to passage.

This year's amendment does not have a Senate companion and is unlikely
to make progress. However, once a state like Massachusetts or New
Jersey makes gay rights history by legalizing same-sex marriage, a
federal amendment could get wider support.

Now here's an interesting statement. It's been discussed, of course; and
written about, of course. And after all the rhetoric, this comes out! Ground
Zero.

It was a lovefest last night at the Poetry Project at St. Mark's Church, and=
=20
deservedly so. Maureen Owen is moving to Denver.

Miles Champion introduced Maureen, for what he told us was her 57th=20
appearance as a reader at the Church, and it wasn=E2=80=99t your typical PoP=
roj introduction.=20
Miles didn=E2=80=99t dissect the work himself, choosing to defer to the late=
 Fielding=20
Dawson--=E2=80=9CThe new book by Maureen Owen is the best book since the las=
t book by=20
Maureen Owen=E2=80=9D--and the great Alice Notley.=20

Instead, Miles talked of what Maureen means to this poetic community, the=20
example she sets forth through her own work and her late magazine Telephone=20=
and=20
still extant press, Telephone Books, and how she demonstrates how one can li=
ve=20
the life of a poet. It was the first introduction I ever heard that had me=20
near tears, and, afterwards, as we all told Miles how wonderful his words we=
re, I=20
discovered I wasn=E2=80=99t alone.

Parish Hall was packed, with a decent mix of generations and genders, but=20
what disappointed me was the dearth of women poets of my generation in the c=
rowd.=20
(Though rocking ladies were in the crowd, including Kimberly Lyons, Martha=20
King, Marcella Durand, Corina Copp, Joanna Fuhrman, Brenda Iijima, Alison=20
Dorfman, Betsy Andrews, Africa Wayne, Patricia Spears Jones, and Erica Kaufm=
an.)=20

I had one women poet call me that afternoon, and I said I=E2=80=99ll see you=
 tonight,=20
and she said what do u mean, and I said Maureen=E2=80=99s reading tonight, a=
nd she=20
said I don=E2=80=99t think I=E2=80=99m gonna make it. Now, normally, I go ok=
ay, and move on to=20
goodbyes, but this time I was like, no, you must go and pay homage to Mauree=
n=20
tonight, she=E2=80=99s moving to Denver, you have to honor her. And the poet=
 said=20
maybe I=E2=80=99ll see you later to shut me up and then didn=E2=80=99t show.=
=20

One thing I=E2=80=99ve learned in this thing Bob Holman endearingly calls po=
biz is=20
you are nowhere without those who came before you, plain and simple Santayan=
a.=20
As a poet-publisher I honor those who paved the way for me, Lawrence=20
Ferlinghetti, Hettie Jones, d.a. levy, Ed Sanders, Maureen Owen, Lewis Warsh=
, and too=20
many others to name, from this and previous generations. These people who de=
vote=20
their lives to their community and their art. These people who may not be so=
=20
flashy but who simply get it done.

It was nice to see one of those people, Maureen, open to a standing ovation=20
following Miles=E2=80=99 words. And what was even better was to watch her de=
liver.=20

She talked of her problems with titles, and then read titles that were=20
amazing, almost poems themselves:

Natasha Drives to the Grand Canyon

The Chinese Family=E2=80=99s Parrot Speaks Chinese, I Do Not

Not Every Restaurant that Attracts Celebrities Has an Attitude

I Don=E2=80=99t Suppose the Nieces Could be More Serious Than They Were Toni=
ght

She reads a series of eight poems based on postcards she has, and, after=20
three poems, goes, =E2=80=9CI probably shouldn=E2=80=99t say this, ah, why n=
ot,=E2=80=9D and tells us=20
that the poems she just read are based on postcards and she shows them to us=
,=20
saying that she knows they=E2=80=99re too small for everyone to see. And the=
n she=20
continues to read the remainder of the series, showing us the postcards with=
 a little=20
flip of her hand.

And she delivered solid lines throughout the night:

the soaked arm of her silk underwear

for instance, Key West is tired of chickens in the road

The word kangaroo in the aboriginal language simply means I don=E2=80=99t un=
derstand

Proving once again that Madonna doesn=E2=80=99t care what we wear

Haircuts in London are very pretty backward

There=E2=80=99s one last chance to see Maureen in action before she heads to=
 the=20
Rockies. This coming Wed., June 4, at 7:00 p.m., at the Poetry Project at St=
.=20

When I see an American Flag, I see a bandage staunching the country's
self-inflicted wounds. It happens when a country's leadership, its
privileged, its elite, works to keep power at all costs, in treasure and in
blood. Not telling his people the truth, Saddam was no different than what
George Bush and his team, which includes a growing segment of the media,
tells their country. Misinformation is not misreading, but a trickle of
blood from the collective mouth, a zip of red. Is the artist alive, or
speaking to the dead?

First, no, we couldn't think "these things" without language, but the
question, I thought was could we think without language. Following the arguments of
Maturana & Varela, everything thinks - is cognizant - not only without
language, but without a brain! This relatively new "discovery" has led to those in AI
to dramatically rethink the possibilities of AI.. thus we now have ALife, etc.
No doubt language is important, but we have to consider it along with
everything else we organisms are doing. So much for language being in brain matter.

Following on from that, Bill's post presupposes a 'knowable' external
reality, as though there is this absolute in the first place. >>

Ben,

I admit I'm no expert on M and V, but what reading I've done does not suggest
that they locate cognition in rocks, which is what your post suggests.  The
focus, as far as I can tell, is on living systems and interactions within
nervous systems (brain required) which produce derivative, not literal, versions of
experience.  Nothing here thus far to suggest there is no external reality.
Quite the opposite, in fact.  Biology is a necessary component.  They seem to
privilege its structural "verities." There is no conflict between what I've
said re:  language and what Maturana and Varela say about interactive systems,
interdependent systems.  Clearly these guys have been influenced big time by
Structuralism.

In addition, their concept of "languaging" involves two or more people
occupying each other, "orienting" themselves in each other.  An interesting analog
to what I've been saying about language, that it functions as an interactive
system, that meaning occurs within and not merely without or between the
elements of that system since each element is a crucial internal component of the
others.  Signification depends on this interaction.  I see nothing in M and V,
thus far, that does injury to what I've been saying.  Their "redefinition" of
cognition seems quite in line with contemporary language theory.  And so far I
see nothing to suggest that meaning occurs beyond semiotics. These guys do seem
to have appropriated the determinism that always lurked in Structuralism,
whereas the poststructuralist view emphasizes indeterminacy.  Even Barthes came
over to Derrida's side.  As I said, I'm not fluent enough in autopoiesis to
know what changes these guys made to their theory down the line, since the early
1980s, if any.

More recently, Chaos Theory is one good example of how any claim for
determinism can go awry.  Actually, I never insisted on an external reality (in fact,
I insisted from my earliest posts on the subject that what, if anything, lies
beyond language is unknowable), but I see no reason to deny one.  If M &V deny
one, I haven't come across that aspect of their theory yet.  However,
Maturana and Varela do seem to offer a fixed structure (a la that old horse,
Structuralism) which controls activity. I can't say at this point if they consider the
fixity of such structures absolute or provisional.  If the former, then I
can't agree.  Structures evolve, and there is always something lurking in the
structure that cannot be accounted for, some resistance to the structure's
operation which both permits that operation and undermines it.  But M's and V's
position is no doubt useful, especially for the social sciences.

Of course I may be mistaken, not knowing as much about autopoiesis as I
should.  Perhaps this interactive model has been transfigured into a claim that
computers "think."  Come to "think" of it, rocks also have interactive systems
that both synchronically and diachronically exchange information, so to speak.
They're called electrons.  But are they cognizant, i.e., aware, as your post
suggests?  Don't they put people far far away for such ideas?  Just kidding.

I'd of course appreciate your pointing me toward what in M's and V's
discourse rejects an external reality.  Nothing I've read thus far does.  A claim for
knowledge as mediation (not literal) is not a dismissal of externality.
Still, M and V seem to play in the same general ballpark as the
structuralists/poststructuralists, so I feel fairly comfortable with what I've read thus far.
I've no argument with their ideas re:  contextualization, for example.  Far from
it.

But consider that whatever anyone says about anything can only be said within
language's landscape of indeterminacy.  M's and V's ideas are only possible
as inscriptions.  It seems language always has the last word.

Does this "seeming" Q.E.D. linguacentricity?  I would argue that language
itself resists that position.  After all, everything anyone says suggesting the
hegemony of language is meaningful only within language which also produces the
contraries to what is said.  What is said--its meaningfulness--depends on
those contraries, carries those contraries within it.  Identity dissolves in di
fference.  Difference dissolves in identity.

Thanks for your very interesting post.

Best,
Bill

Maybe it should be called THE BIG DUNCE? (see story below)


The (Toronto) Globe and Mail
28 May 2003           Front Page

9/11 film makes hero of Bush
TV movie, made with White House help, gives revised account of
President's day

By DOUG SAUNDERS
Wednesday, May 28, 2003 - Page A1

Trapped on the other side of the country aboard Air Force One, the
President has lost his cool: "If some tinhorn terrorist wants me, tell
him to come and get me! I'll be at home! Waiting for the bastard!"

His Secret Service chief seems taken aback. "But Mr. President . . ."

The President brusquely interrupts him. "Try Commander-in-Chief. Whose
present command is: Take the President home!"

Was this George W. Bush's moment of resolve on Sept. 11, 2001? Well, not
exactly. Actually, the scene took place this month, on a Toronto sound
stage.The histrionics, filmed for a two-hour TV movie to be broadcast
this September, are as close as you can get to an official White House
account of its activities at the outset of the war on terrorism.

Written and produced by a White House insider with the close
co-operation of Mr. Bush and his top officials, The Big Dance represents
an unusually close merger of Washington's ambitions and Hollywood's
movie machinery.

A copy of the script obtained by The Globe and Mail reveals a prime-time
drama starring a nearly infallible, heroic president with little or no
dissension in his ranks and a penchant for delivering articulate,
stirring, off-the-cuff addresses to colleagues.

That the whole thing was filmed in Canada and is eligible for financial
aid from Canadian taxpayers, and that its loyal Republican
writer-producer is a Canadian citizen best known for his adaptation of
The Apprenticeship of Duddy Kravitz, are ironies that will be lost on
most of its American viewers when it airs on the Showtime network this
fall.

While the film is intended for U.S. viewers, it is produced in
collaboration with Toronto-based Dufferin Gate Productions in order to
take advantage of Canadian government incentives. It is eligible for the
federal Film or Video Production Services Tax Credit, the Ontario Film
and Television Production Services Tax Credit and a federal tax-shelter
program, which together could result in hundreds of thousands of dollars
in Canadian government cheques being sent to the producers.

Lionel Chetwynd, the film's creator, sees nothing untoward about his
role as the semi-official White House apologist in Hollywood. For him,
having a well-connected Republican create the movie was a way to get the
official message around what he sees as an entertainment industry packed
with liberals and Democrats.

"A feeding frenzy had started to develop around this story, and a lot of
people who wanted to do this story had a very clear political agenda,
very clear," Mr. Chetwynd said in an interview from his Los Angeles home
yesterday.

"My own view of the administration is somewhat more sympathetic than,
say, Alec Baldwin's. . . . In fact, I'm technically a member of the
administration [Mr. Chetwynd sits on the President's Committee on the
Arts and Humanities], so I let it be known that I was also interested in
doing it. I threw myself on the mercies of my friend Karl Rove."

Mr. Rove is the President's chief political adviser, so this was not a
typical Hollywood pitch. But then, Mr. Chetwynd is not a typical
Hollywood writer-producer: He is founder of the Wednesday Morning Club,
an organization for the movie colony's relatively small band of
Republicans, and he led the White House's efforts to enlist Hollywood's
support after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.

Mr. Chetwynd's script is based on lengthy interviews with Mr. Bush, Mr.
Rove, top aide Andy Card, retiring White House press aide Ari Fleischer,
Defence Secretary Donald Rumsfeld and other Republican officials in the
White House and the Pentagon. He says every scene and line of dialogue
was described to him by an insider or taken from credible reports.

Yet compared with other journalistic accounts of the period, the movie
is clearly an effort to reconstruct Mr. Bush as a determined and
principled military leader. The public image of Mr. Bush -- who avoided
military service in Vietnam and who has often been derided as a doe-eyed
naif on satirical TV shows -- is a key concern to White House
communications officials, many of them friends of Mr. Chetwynd.

While Mr. Chetwynd says he principally wanted to tell a good story, the
movie's mission gives it a distinctly different tint from other such
accounts.

The scene aboard Air Force One is offered in several other accounts --
but most of them present Mr. Bush as worried as he asks to go home. An
account published by the British Daily Telegraph has him saying: "I'm
not going to do it [appear on TV] from an Air Force base. Not while
folks are under the rubble. I'm coming home."

Bob Woodward, the Washington Post reporter, recounts a line similar to
Mr. Chetwynd's in his book Bush At War: "We need to get back to
Washington. We don't need some tinhorn terrorist to scare us off. The
American people want to know where their President is." But it is a
complaint, not an order.

In accounts such as Mr. Woodward's, Mr. Bush seems uncertain, and spends
a lot of time approving proposals from his aides. In this movie, Mr.
Bush delivers long, stirring speeches that immediately become policy.

Mr. Chetwynd said that he did not write such scenes principally to
bolster the image of Mr. Bush, but that the image was a concern."The
belittling of the President really irritated me, but I didn't start out
on a crusade," he said. "I wanted to show . . . how he was able in that
moment to grab hold of things as a leader in those critical days."

Hi Jim - This is really of great interest to me. There have been, in print
of course, highly edited list readers - for example the ReadMe that came
out of Nettime. But it would be fantastic to have material available and
searchable on a cdrom. I know from Google Hacks that Google is highly
configurable; another possibility would be using a form of grep to search
across files and indexes.

I tend to go for magazine cdroms - the Linux Journal has an excellent one.

As far as peripherality is concerned, I think at least for myself, my work
is central; I wouldn't be able to proceed without believing that. I think
that is also true for a lot of writers. But I do feel as if technology and
technological dispersion is going to swamp what passes for 'art' and for
'artworks,' no matter how advanced; I keep thinking of the 30 million in
Japan doing SMS for example, the material in Rheingold's Smart Mobs, and
the fact that wireless is, I believe, exponentially outpacing the growth
of the Net itself. And standard email is beginning swamped as well, by
spam - just as Usenet was/is - I was off for a day, and had 666 messages
when I returned. Without constant culling, or changing my address, my
account will crash at this point.

People see this list primarily, I believe, as a critical exchange-about -
the emphasis being on the 'about' that points elsewhere, vectors out of
the region, even the ontology of being online. For some of us, and I think
you might feel this way to some extent, the list, and all lists, are
ongoing works/productions in themselves - certainly Wryting and Nettime
come across that way - as do Empyre (where I follow your critical writing
of course), Syndicate, etc. Poetics seems almost bipolar in content - in
the sense that some people see it as a distributive electronic mode, and
others as referent ultimately to talk/seminar/print...

Sorry for the meandering. I do think that in the long run, distribution
and dispersion will becoming increasingly of import - and in a very
un-McLuhanesque way. For myself, I've been thinking of the universe itself
less in terms of state/process, and more as dispersion/filtering, and am
trying to write to that effect.

Robert Creeley, YESTERDAYS (pub. Dec 2002)
5.5 x 7 inches, 24 pages, hand sewn
Recent poems
$15

Ron Silliman writes in his blog
http://ronsilliman.blogspot.com/2003_04_01_ronsilliman_archive.html#92214661.
Between his New Direction volumes, Robert Creeley has developed a pattern
of issuing one or more small chapbooks in the interim  they engage his
long-standing commitment to the small press scene and are often a relief
against the bland uniform packaging that is the ND trademark. None of these
chapbooks has been simpler, nor more elegant or delightful than Yesterdays,
Creeley's latest from Chax Press. Charles Alexander, who learned the book
arts directly from Walter Hamady, the Yoda of fine press printing, is
himself a master craftsman with a rare sense of just when to assert himself
in the process. With Yesterdays, Alexander has taken the lowest key
approach, letting Creeley's text do all the heavy lifting.
As well it does. These pieces are among the very best of Creeley's recent
work, which means that as a reader I'm virtually hopping up & down with
excitement at each new poem. Viz:
As I rode out one morning
just at break of day
a pain came upon me
unexpectedly

As I thought one day
not to think anymore,
I thought again,
caught, and could not stop

Were I the horse I rode,
were I the bridge I crossed,
were I a tree
unable to move,

the lake would have
no reflections,
the sweet, soft air
no sounds.

So I hear, I see,
tell still the echoing story
of all that lives in a forest,
all that surrounds me.

A continuous sequence of poems

Recalling Pound at his lyrical best, the image containing multiple

delight.

(excerpt from Figures: 32 Poems)
Society is all but rude
To this delicious solitude.

.

All you can eat.

.

In the midst of great happiness
listen to the voice inside you crying
'desist, desist.'

.

Swan-luminous night.

.

Golden
as a crust of bread.

The smell of grapes.
Lost
amid vine-clad.

.

A careful man
dips his brush   the tip
a cone of black.

.

Like a swan's neck.

MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="US-ASCII"
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

does anyone else get the sense that barney in his symbol-mindedness was
trying to create something that generates interpretation?  i mean, i really
don't think the work was built around any prefabricated personal cosmology,
as the hype surrounding it would have you believe.  i think it just looks
like it was to those not intimate with artistic inspiration and madness
of artistic pursuit.

also i don't think m barney's work does anything to the *detriment* of
masonry.  if anything he's marketed masonry to a new generation.  he's made
it new.  he's made it exotic, sexy.

now don't get me wrong, I found the whole guggenheim thing fascinating.  and
once the cycle hits dvd i'll add it to my collection.  but i don't find it
beyond reproach or analysis.

(Barney's work reminds me of something Zappa presaged parodically in his
Joe's Garage: Appliantology's L Ron Hoover who encourages Joe to stay in the
closet where it's "a lot of fun...fifty bucks please":

Joe:
Oh oh oh mystical Advisor
What is my problem,
tell me
can you see?

L. Ron Hoover:
Well, you have nothing to fear, my son!
You are a Latent Appliance Fetishist,
it appears to me!

Joe:
That all seems very, very strange.
I never crazed a toaster or a color TV.

L. Ron:
A Latent Appliance Fetishist is a person who refuses to admit to his or
herself
that sexual gratification can only be achieved through the use of
MACHINES...
Get the picture?

Joe:
Are you telling me
I should come out
of the closet now
Mr. Ron?

L. Ron Hoover:
No, my son!
You must go into THE CLOSET
And you will have
a lot of fun!
That's where they all live,
So if you want an appliance to love you
you'll have to go in there 'n' get you one

Joe:
Well...that seems simple enough....

L. Ron:
Yes, but if you want a really GOOD one,
you'll have to learn a foreign language...

Joe:
German, for instance?

L. Ron:
That's right...a lot of really cute ones come from over there!
(fifty bucks, please).
)

It only makes sense to rent out the entire Guggenheim for such a purpose as
marketing masonry to the new generation.  ok not "rent" to be precise, but
money's involved, and lots of it, in barney's work.  which, by the way, the
money spent is fine with me.  but it is indicative.  there's an allure to it
all with its opulent surfaces and polyvalently fetishistic sexual
opportunities.  please don't anyone be so stupid as to equate what i'm
saying with the suggestion that barney's motive was to market masonry.
that's a bit reductionist.  i am saying it does serve that purpose.

i think many web artists and epoets could benefit from barney's apparent
sense of craft: the production value (the polish, the level of detail) of
barney's work is perhaps its most valuable and in a deeper sense most
underwhelming asset.  that is to say, for visual art, especially animated
visual art, rich surfaces are important, essential even, but they are not
an end but instead a means.  barney certainly doesn't try to pass off
monstrously ugly and uncrafted garbage as art.  his color palettes work.
his compositions work. none of it looks slapdash.  the work appears as if
it is the produce of some suffocating amount of self-criticism.  i imagine
barney's garbage pail for artistic rejects to be enormous.  to his credit.
as art for art's sake, barney's work succeeds.  what might be most
fascinating is how he actually put it all together, how he managed the work,
how he made it, etc.  the shot of the jcrew model coming out of the elevator
perhaps embodies the numerous conflicts in barney's works.  i do consider
conflict to be an asset, however.  with all the apparent layers, I wanted
more layers.

barney is also obviously a master of juxtaposition, and the popularity of
the cremaster cycle marks the changing of an era in popular perception and
valuation of visual art.  the common man or woman will become less and less
likely to poster their homes with the works of degas or vangogh and more
likely poster their homes instead with the works of duchamp, ernst, and
magritte.  juxtaposition sells.

is the issue not 'whether' but 'how'?  As any medically literate (e.g.,
http://www.chcs.org/resource/pdf/hl3.pdf) general practitioner or
gastroenterologist will tell you there does seem to be a 'second brain'
(Gershon) that speaks digestion, etc. intependent of the guy on top and
communicates with the same substances (e.g., serotonin) as the guy on top
does.  if we can decipher gut language are we on speaking terms with the
preconsciuos?  Or is this just metaphor and not metonym?

I love these short blip intakes from the various, Charles. In the name of
commerce you've managed to give us a delightful E-anthology!
Suddenly all the little things become large. As for an instant example, I
just bought a "uni-ball, Smooth, Real Smooth. Vision", it's a pen! at
Walgreens, which carries this wonderful little warning:

Important: when traveling on a plane,
remember to uncap the pen
with the tip facing "upward" to
 reduce any risk of leakage."

What poets may suffer in Vision in flight! Darkened pockets.

we need at least a third logical term to handle this: as-if.

each human variously draws a line separating "as-if self" from "as-if
not-self".
consider: are your dreams you? are your mistakes you? are your pains you?
(someone i knew once said, "Everything I can see to the horizon is part of
me.")
is your city you? is your nation you? ...

Language: sounds = "as-if things".

"as-if" is prior to language. dogs have "mine" but not "me".

But, Mike, why on earth should anyone care what the
New Yorker has to say about poetry?  When was the last
time it published any poetry or criticism on any
poetry by a living author that uses techniques not in
wide use by 1978 at the very latest?

I suspect that it is their innate need for diversity
that causes creative people to have relatively many
"weak ties of acquaintanceship" rather than their
relatively many "weak ties of acquaintanceship" that
cause their creativity.  Interesting thoughts, though.

 I am visiting Boston soon: between  June 14 and 21.  I would like to know
what a poet is to do there. News of  readings would be great.  (I can do one
myself should a last minute opportunity appear for a poet from the end of
the earth). I am also interested in art exhibitions.

Kamau Brathwaite's _Middle Passages_
is the new featured poem in CYBERGRAPHIA
http://cg.bard.edu


previous poems...
Diane Glancy's "Fodder"
Alice Notley's "White Phosphorus"
Charles Bernstein's "Defence of Poetry"



****

The "featured poem" aspect of Cybergraphia is a year long project that
will present twelve contemporary poems, a brief bio and some discussion
about the author, and a discussion of one or more possible way(s) to
teach the poem. This, in its entirety, is designed to be a sort of
mini-anthology introduction to the terrain of innovative contemporary
poetry. The emphasis in Cybergraphia is not on craft or expertise or
canon formation. These works, ones that might be called "avant garde" or
"innovative," are featured because they encourage active, generative,
and speculative thinking; because they stretch or reconfigure language
in exciting ways.

If a poem is still in print, there is a link to the publisher's website.
Poems posted here are copyright protected. Do not download the poem from
this site or photocopy the poem for classroom use. Instead show your
support for contemporary writing by ordering the author's work for your
class.

The pedagogical discussion presented here is provisional and always
being revised. It is presented as just one option, not the only one. The
site draws heavily from the teaching strategies of the Institute for
Writing and Thinking at Bard College. The Institute privileges teaching
models that are experiential in the sense that practice and theory
support each other and that encourage collaborative learning methods in
which reading, writing, and thinking are active processes. See also,

Perhaps Nick might have some thoughts here, but 'as-if' brings in a whole
realm of 'psychoanalysis' and precognition (Winnicott and the Brits, for
example) that the old standbys like the Freudians and Lacanians never let
into the academic discourse arena?

Even though she's not on the approved reading list here, Stewart does bring
in Marx and Adorno in a way that is of interest to me as 'championing'
poetry as social rather than antisocial in its basic impulse and I think
relates to Pennebaker's and others findings on suicidal poets
http://homepage.psy.utexas.edu/homepage/faculty/pennebaker/reprints/Suicidal
Poets.PDF
which suggest that suicidality has less to do with poetry than it does with
narcissism of those poets.

Thanks Patrick, also for this. Love the Zappa song ref.
Barney is not about to enter or win a "dry wall" masonry building
competition!
There is that wonderfully squeamish fecal and/or spermatic side to Barney's
work - that viscerally connects to the usually shocked sight of the parent
who discovers his young young child in the bath tub joyously playing boats
or whatever with his poops.

Then Barney does refine the surfaces, as you suggest, and loves to collide
contrary material, leather to metal, etc.

"Indulging the obscene Baroque" is the fancy crit phrase that the B "oeuvre"
does bring to mind, well, at least my mind.

of course, such 'list reader' could be written as a 'plugin' to Outlook Express (in Visual
Basic) and so on, so that it would just plug in to  the email client many people use, and would
thereby come equipped as a real email client. but that has its problems, not least of which is
repackaging such a commercial product on CD.

the thing i'm thinking of would essentially be for reading lists that were dead. this has some
utility. but kind of depressing.

one's email client is quite a sophisticated application which has thousands of person-hours of
development time in it. but there are many email clients across many platforms. i know you use
Pine. I use Outlook.

let's slow down a bit, if we may, please, Alan. What is "technological dispersion", or what are
some of the primary factors in it? And in what sense would they then "swamp what passes for
'art'"?

What are some of the key growths in wireless that are independent of the Net?

So is the fate of Usenet an example of a more general type of fate posited by Rheingold for
public network technologies? Usenet is still used, and in some ways is superior to email lists
('get next 100 messages', for example, is something you can do with a Usenet client), but it
certainly isn't as widely used as it used to be. i suppose that the spamming of the Usenet lists
was a big factor here. Also, the delivery mechanism is initiated when you connect to the group,
rather than the automatic delivery that happens with email lists. And the Usenet groups are
carried (or not) like 'channels' by one's Internet Service Provider whereas there is no such
involvement of the ISP in the email lists to which one subscribes.

Yes, I have enjoyed participating in various email lists as dialogical evolutions in poetics of
digital art. As ongoing works/productions in themselves (hence my interest in possibly making a
'list reader').

It seems that when we look at the growth of particular email lists, we see them proceeding with
some focus and concentration at first and then they blur into a kind of 'dispersion' through
sheer diversity of the interests of those on the list. Into a wide range of announcements
(distribution)...people begin to talk at one another rather than with one another. To the point
where it loses its function as a publication and becomes more like a huge bulletin board.

Un-McLuhanesque in what way?

the universe itself. hmm.

Outline for the 27 May British Council Lecture

[see
http://hypobololemaioi.com/hyoeides/harm.html
for a view of the Poetic
through WB's 1930s Paris-Berlin-Moscow filter]

I. Description of the method of the Arcades Project
        A. Book reconstructed from manuscript (1950 Adorno reference)
        B. Montage (simultaneity of perception; planes & dimensions of
        reference; non-linear narrative; series & assemblages: "Film:
        unfolding of all the forms of perception, the tempos and
        rhythms, which lie preformed in today's machines" [K3,3].
        C. Quotation (multiple and contradictory points of view - not
        citations of authorities)
        D. Aphorism & Fragment (the notation, not the finished thought
        E. Against Academicism (which separates Past from Present &
        makes a museum out of art / thought / culture)

II. What were the arcades themselves? The first shopping centers,
architectures of display ("The arcades are a center of commerce in
luxury items" - Paris, the Capital of the 19th C.)
        A. The arcades as mid-19th century architectures not simply a
        place where you would go to buy what you needed, but an
        architecture of display where a society and its economy
        exhibited to the masses of people in the urban centers the
        luxury goods and the dream life the display of these goods
        inspired. The arcades as Dream Factories. The subjectivity of
        the consumer begins to be constructed at this time on a mass
        scale. How?
        B. The advent of the mechanical image (photography) and the
        pressure of the development of the image on language. Visual
        communications challenge traditional conceptions of the
        relationship between writing and thought. "The primary
        interest of allegory is not linguistic but optical. 'Images
        --my great, my primitive passion' (Baudelaire [J59,u].
        "Images in the collective consciousness in which the new is
        permeated with the old." "For the painted sky of summer that
        looks down from the arcades in the reading room of the
        Bibliotheque Nationale in Paris" (N1,50.

III. The arcades of mid-19th century Paris & Berlin metamorphose
(morph) into the Internet at the end of the millenium, only 150 years
later. Parallels: Imagination & Virtuality, New Velocities:
        A. The 'convolutes': Fashion; Iron Construction;
        Exhibitions/Advertising; Baudelaire; Dream City & Dream House;
        The Flaneur; Panorama; Modes of Lighting; Photography;
        Reproduction Technology
        B. [B2,1]: "A kindred problem arose with the advent of new
        velocities, which gave life an altered rhythm.... For
        example, in posters. 'These images of a day or an hour...
        symbolize to a higher degree the sudden, shock-filled,
        multiform life that carries us away.' Maurice Talmeyr,
        La Cite du sang ( Paris, 1901).
        C. "Arcades are houses or passages having no outside
        --like the dream." [L1a,1].
        D. Arcades. Iron & Electronic architectures: "it remained only
        to connect these isolated sections to one another in order to
        constitute a network ... embracing the whole city" [and]
        "Remarkable propensity for structures that convey and connect
        --as, of course, the arcades do." [E2a,4].
        E. Fashion. "The loop-the-loop came on the scene, and
        Parisians seized on this entertainment with a frenzy."
        "And it is not surprising that a chronicler adds apocalyptic
        prophecies to this connection and foretells a time when people
        will have been blinded by the effects of too much electric
        light and maddened by the tempo of news reporting.
        --Paris en songe, 1863.
        F. Iron & Glass construction. "Iron is, for us, only
        artificially compressed durability and tenacity"
        (1907). Volatility of building materials. The Eiffel Tower.
        G. Exhibitions/Advertising. "Falser colors are possible in the
        arcades." (Digitalization). "'Another new word: la reclame
        (advertisement). Will it make a fortune?' Nadar, Quand j'etais
        photographe, Paris 1900)." [G2a,10].
        H. Baudelaire. Allegory. Word & Image. The Ragpicker. "Perhaps
        only Leopardi, Edgar Poe, and Dostoevsky experienced such a
        dearth of happiness, such a power of desolation. Round about
        him, this century, which in other respects seems so
        flourishing, takes on the terrible aspect of a desert."
        Edmond Jaloux, 1921.
                1. Isolation, estrangement, increasing
                artificiality of existence. "The poet has made his
                dwelling in space itself, one could say
                --or in the abyss." [J69a,5].
                2. Poetry and the literary market: feuilleton.
                3. "Realism--a repulsive insult flung in the face of
                every analytic writer" (CB)

IV. AURA: 'The threat to aura posed by the experience of shock'
DEFINITION OF THE AURA AS THE AURA OF DISTANCE OPENED UP WITH THE
LOOK THAT AWAKENS IN AN OBJECT PERCEIVED [J47 a,1] THE GAZE IN WHICH
THE MAGIC OF DISTANCE IS EXTINGUISHED [J47a,1] FOR THE DECLINE OF THE
AURA, ONE THING WITHIN THE REALM OF MASS PRODUCTION IS OF OVERRIDING
IMPORTANCE: THE MASSIVE REPRODUCTION OF THE IMAGE [J60a,4].
        A. Pedagogic side of this undertaking: 'To educate the
        image-making medium within us, raising it to a stereoscopic and
        dimensional seeing into the depths of historical shadows."
        [N1,8].
        B. At issue, in other words, is the attempt to grasp an
        economic process as perceptible Ur-phenomenon, from out of
        which proceed all manifestations of life in the arcades
        [N1a,6].
        C. "The history that showed things 'as they really were' was
        the strongest narcotic of the [19th] century." [N3,4]
                1. "The dreaming collective knows no history. Events
                pass before it as always identical and always new."
                [S2,1]
                2. "In fantastic montage--nerve and electrical wire
                not infrequently meet (and that the vegetal nervous
                system in particular operates, as a limiting form,
                to mediate between the world of organism and the world
                of technology ... this telegraphic image of
                exchange" [S9,3]
                3. The Glare of the Screen: Poe in the Philosophy of
                Furniture. "Glare is a leading error in the philosophy
                of American household decoration.... We are violently
                enamored of gas and of glass. The former is totally
                inadmissible within doors. Its harsh and unsteady
                light offends. No one having both brains and eyes will
                use it." (Poe, quoted by Baudelaire).
                4. Photography & Panorama. "What makes the first
                photographs so incomparable is perhaps this: that they
                present the earliest image of the encounter of machine
                and man." [y4a,2]. The snapshot - its technological
                function in the mechanism and its sterilizing function
                in the experience.

V. Conclusion: Virtuality, Simulation, Instant communication, Masks &
Masquerading, Chance & Fictitious encounters, Communications networks,
Multimedia-sound & moving image, digital editing, smooth surfaces &
the appearance of the appearance (mirroring) - the prototypes of these
contemporary concepts among a host of others can be traced back to the
mid-19th cent. and the arcades - though by saying Benjamin looked
forward by working backwards is not to claim for the Arcades Project
the status of a prophetic text, nor even canonical text: what can be
learned from these pages is that the present misrecognizes itself -
whether the present then or the present now - a term like globalism
for example, might be the very opposite of the shocks and ruptures
being pushed forward from the past

Bob, For my money Alice Quinn is the worst poetry editor on the planet -- she
chooses absolutely atrocious poems, and the situation is only made worse by the
fact that she'll occasionally let a big name poet like Ashbery slide through
(which I don't hold against Ashbery incidentally - why not have the NYer's
readers read him instead of some crappy poem by Pinsky et al, whatever the bad
editorial intentions).  I myself am not so smug about the NYer as a whole.  I
think its a halfway decent mag with many intelligent readers -- some of their
writers (Seymour Hirsch, Schjeldahl, Anthony Lane, Jon Lee Anderson come to
mind) are pretty damn good.  So why not try to let the readership know that
they shouldn't take Malcolm's word on Stein?  Language is a site of social
contestation.  I'm not content to preach to my little choir of good poetry
lovers.  I suppose my experience teaching Stein plays into this -- students who
have never been exposed to anything like Stein sometimes end up loving her and
when this happens they walk away with a very different relationship to their
own language.  Much more so than Malcolm's blunt critique of Stein's supposed
fascist sympathies, I was put off by her disdain for the writing -- which she
reads as a simple attention-grab by the simple-minded overconfident baby in the
bourgeois family.  Why should those NYer readers unfamiliar with Stein not be
informed that their getting a stupid, narrow-minded portrait here?  Stein
herself treated poetry as action and my writing to the NYer was done in that
spirit.

Dear Wystan,
One thing a poet can do is meet other poets.  I'm already hoping to meet =
Trevor Joyce and Ann Fisher-Wirth in Boston or Providence in June.  Would =
you like to meet too?  I live in Providence, which is well worth a visit.  =
It's an hour by bus or train from Boston.  I could take you to the =
terrific John Hay collection of 20th century poetry at Brown University.  =
Another great thing to do, if you can, is go to Provincetown: that's 2-3 =
hrs by Bonanza Bus from Boston.  The great poet Alan Dugan lives nearby in =
Truro and there is usually some action around the Fine Arts Work Center.  =
But the Boston dudes will kill me for touting Providence and Provincetown =
(I'm glad there aren't any more towns around here beginning with "Prov," =
like "Provisionaltown" or "Probablytown"..)as Boston itself is bursting =
with poets and poetry and bookstores and stuff.

 I am visiting Boston soon: between  June 14 and 21.  I would like to know
what a poet is to do there. News of  readings would be great.  (I can do =
one
myself should a last minute opportunity appear for a poet from the end of
the earth). I am also interested in art exhibitions.

Hi all,

Poems 1-50 of my ongoing serial "My Angie Dickinson" are now up at:

http://myangiedickinson.blogspot.com

Go have a looksee!

Here's a recent one:


#49

Divorce is not Granted  by the Pope 
Married to Henry VIII 
A trip to Bermuda is over in weeks
So the Wife can become  serious 

A teenager "dates"  the daughter 
Tries to "get through" eight songs
The kids on Astro Orbiter
Were Known as "affinity" groups 

In the future a cutting-edge android
In the form of a boy-sheath 
The full-length matching sequined skirt
The Puritan strain rides underneath



-m.

  PUZZLE PARADE
May 29 - June 28, 2003
Opening reception: May 29th, 2003 6 - 8 pm

Curated by Maria Gadegaard

Malene Bach
Milena Bonifacini
Nils Erik Gjerdevik
Malene Landgreen
Bodil Nielsen

Puzzle Parade is an oversized, immense site-specific painting generated
by a collective of five New Formalist Danish painters.

Structured as a purely aesthetic game of odds and chance, and informed
by the premises of Color Field painting filtered through Northern Light
sensibilities, this project offers a broad study that explores the
possibilities, range and limits of painting by using as its playing
field White Box's challenging architectural exhibition space.

Over the course of five days - from May 25 to May 29 - and open to daily
public scrutiny, the selected artists will complete a puzzle.  In this
Puzzle Parade, each player works within a particular block of space
while collectively sharing the larger terrain. According to the agreed
game rules, they will tip off, tackle, guard, box out and switch their
counter pictorial markings in the pursuit of creating a crooked,
humorous and surprising set of abstract stories.

Digital images of the work will be posted on the White Box web site
www.whiteboxny.org daily during the installation process.

This project was made possible by the support of the Danish Contemporary
Art Foundation, The Royal Danish Consulate, Engineer Ernst B. Sund
Foundation and the Asta and Jul. P. Justesen Foundation.

Viewing hours: Tuesday-Saturday 11am - 6pm.

White Box is a 501[c][3] not-for-profit arts organization.

I agree with what you say here.  When I was in college I used to get the
NYer just for the amazing Pauline Kael film reviews.  Then after she left,
and as I got deeper into poetry, I boycotted the mag for years on
principle.  A few years a ago a good subscription deal, along with a move
to a city, brought me back, and now I'm a regular reader, even tho the mag
often infuriates me.  What's really astounding, as you suggest, is that
some of the political and cultural writing in the mag is quite good
(Hersch is especially astute on politics), and even some of the fiction is
strong, while the poetry editing remains absolutely, unbelievably
atrocious.  So yes, there have to be some intelligent readers of the mag
to whom one might be able to speak with an informed letter (or whole bunch
of
letters) on the subject of poetry.  If this happened often enough, maybe
they'd figure out they were doing something wrong...

You know how when you're following a certain line, or lines, of inquiry
various stuff starts to jump out at you from disparate sources, setting up
some sort of strange resonance network?  Here's a fairly "random"
grouping.

--

"Now, having dined, comfortably lying in my overstuffed lounge chair, I am
holding a pencil and a piece of paper.  My brow is unfurrowed because I
have dismissed all concern from my mind.  My thinking seems something
separate from me.  I can see it.  It rises and falls...but that is its
only activity.  To remind it that it is my thinking and that its duty is
to make itself evident, I grasp the pencil."
(Svevo, Zeno's Conscience)

--

"As soon as I see, it is necessary that the vision (as is so well
indicated by the double meaning of the word) be doubled with a
complementary vision or with another vision: myself seen from without,
such as another would see me, installed in the midst of the visible,
occupied in considering it from a certain spot." [This chimes
interestingly with autopoietic insistence on the role of the observer.]
(Merleau-Ponty, The Visible and the Invisible)

--

"To consent to language signifies to act in such a way that, in the
abysmal experience of the taking place of language, in the removal of the
voice, another Voice is disclosed to man, and along with this are also
disclosed the dimension of being and the moral risk of nothingness." [And
Bill asked about my "resistance"!  But of course, one must consent.]
(Giorgio Agamben, Language and Death, cited by Taggart writing on Oppen)

--
"The doors are too small, and the steps are made of dough!"
(Murder, My Sweet, film adaptation of Chandler's  Farewell, My Lovely,
directed by Dmytryk, who went on, but the way, to get blacklisted.
Marlowe has just been drugged up at a "sanitarium" run by the mob.)
[Liked this one as a reminder of the subjective nature of
perception/experience, and it seemed especially hilarious to me last night
since I had just had abdominal surgery yesterday (nothing too serious) and
was woozy with pain-killers.  And today I get to keep making the choice
between a rather painfully "embodied" state and a fuzzily floating head,
which is why I'm sitting here typing out quotes instead of doing the stuff
I should be doing...]

-- I once read in an alternative grocery store newsletter that to simply
rearrange the shelves in the store creates an impression that everything
is new again and customers buy 20% more, and the staff works 20% harder.

This might have to do with neural organization -- and bear again on
reality vs. language.

I've also read that going new places in old age can keep a person
feeling younger, and keep their mind sharp.  So that people who are rich
and have the money to travel live longer.

Again this is probably neural to a great extent.

Once a place becomes old the neurons aren't firing as much, or something
like this?

Mark,  your point is very interesting here.  The reason I'm not talking about the
war is that I feel abysmally ignorant about that part of the world (as well as
most other things).  Since the WTC attack I've read Bernard Lewis, Edward Said,
and Abu-Khalil, and several others, watched CNN, etc.  But I still don't know.
Last night they had all these men who had been in Saddam's torture chambers on --
going into the places and showing the weird gadgets that he attached to their
ears and genitals.  I thought, he needed to be attacked.  But, from the air?  And
who are all these people?  In the city of Mosul, for instance, there are a
million and a half Christians.  That's to the north.  Well, there used to be five
million of them fifty years ago.  They've been slaughtered, and they've also
left.  They make up a big percentage of what passes for a middle class in Iraq.
They are the last people on earth to speak Aramaic, the language that Christ
spoke.  Mosul, in fact, is the newest name for what used to be Ninevah!  Ninevah
was propagandized by Jonah, after he got out of the whale.  And so you'd think --
ok, these people would probably be on our side.  But the Kurds, who are also on
our side, apparently, have themselves slaughtered several hundred thousand of
these Christians.  And Saddam's men have butchered them, too.  And then it turns
out that Saddam likes the Christians better than the Shiites.  In fact, his vice
president was a Christian from this group, and this vice president is responsible
for some of the tragedies.  It's so perplexing, so utterly mixed up, that it
really is like looking into a can of worms.  Add the oil motives, add the British
history in the region, the Russians want it, the Kuwaitis ARE blocking the Iraqi
access to the sea, and it beats me.  Early on when the war started I thought I
knew what was going on, and now I'm just getting more and more confused every day
the more I learn.  I don't see any thesis, any argument, any clear logic for
improving the situation.  Wrapping American flags around Saddam's head wasn't a
good idea.  But I don't know what is. I don't really know if the situation has
been worsened or made better for the average Iraqi, if such a mythical creature
could be said to exist.  It's certainly changed.  Now just when I was beginning
to get up to speed on this Iraq issue there's a full-blown horror show in the
Congo.  These histories are endlessly deep.  And people have a sense in these
older places that goes back sometimes thousands of years.

I once talked to a nice civilized Serbian man who runs a big hotel in the Pocono
Mountains.  He was a professional soccer player in Germany when the Croats came
and butchered his entire family.  He's the only person left.  So I asked him if
he had any sympathy for the Bosnian Muslims.  Hell no, he said, they've only been
there 600 years!  They're interlopers!

That seems a long time to bear a grudge, no?  But how bombs are going to help
beats me.

Or conversely how knocking over the WTC towers is going to help is equally beyond
me.  Isn't it like scratching poison ivy?

Personally, I'm in favor of setting up a democracy in Iraq, but I don't think it
can be easily done.  It worked in Germany, Japan, and some other places after
WWII, though, so I'm not sure.

So who wants to hear from a guy who isn't sure about what he's talking about,
anyway?

Mike

I was reading the article this morning over
breakfast -- between surfing for good cartoons and
gagging over the atrocious poetry -- and I have to
say it didn't raise my hackles as it seems to have
done yours. In fact I broke out laughing in
delight while reading out loud the bits of Stein
they'd printed -- perhaps the opposite effect it
was intended to have in this context?

I'm not done with the article, so maybe it hasn't
hit me yet. I did read the part about the
"oozing," and it struck me as the typical
middle-brow skepticism that seems to surround the
act of serious writing. Stein DID say after all
that a half an hour of writing was plenty for her,
but that was after YEARS of famously staying up
all night to work on writing then sleeping till
noon. Nowhere does Malcolm acknowledge this fact,
nor how on earth a work as immense as "The Making
of Americans" could have been done on 30 minutes a
day of writing -- er, excuse me, "oozing" out
text.

Frankly I'm not terribly interested in whether
Stein voted Republican or Democrat, and I
certainly don't want to encourage a thread on this
note. But I noticed that you didn't mention the
"outing" in your actual letter -- is that because
it's more of a contextual argument, or are there
factual errors here?

Hi all,  I'm pasting below a leter to the editor I
just sent to the New Yorker
regarding Janet Malcolm's insipid piece on
Gertrude Stein.  The "outing" of
Stein as a fascist sympathizer dispenses with all
historical and personal
nuance (what must she think of Pound?!) and the
discussion of Stein's writing
is completely idiotic.  I try to be a bit more
politic in the letter itself but
that's the upshot.  If anyone else was as annoyed
as I was reading this (I
could barely get through the damn thing) I'd
encourage you to send your own
letter to themail@newyorker.com.  If enough people
send they'll have to print
at least one I'd imagine.  Suddenly Alice Quinn's
incomprehensible tenure as
Poetry Editor is starting to make more
nse!   -m.

****************
Dear Editor,

Whatever useful biographical information is
contained in Janet Malcolms
"Gertrude Steins War" (June 2nd) is marred by her
bizarrely vindictive tone
and transparent dislike for Steins writing.
Malcolm describes Stein as simply
"oozing" the thousands of pages she produced over
a lifetime, relying on a
classic misogynist stereotype regarding women
writers (Hawthorne chose the word
"scribbling").  William Carlos Williams and Ralph
Ellison considered her work
brilliant, as do a host of vital contemporary
American poets including Susan
Howe, John Ashbery, Robert Creeley  and Harryette
Mullen.  Malcolm simply lumps
all who appreciate Steins writing under the
heading "new Stein critics," the
better to dismiss them summarily.  Surely the New
Yorkers readers deserve
better than the facile innuendo and
pop-psychologizing that mark this articles
every page.  Malcolm calls "the arrogant desire to
impose a narrative on the
stray bits and pieces of a life" a "crucial
biographers trait."  Well, Malcolm
certainly has this trait in spades.

Sincerely,

Michael Magee

The only magazine that runs more atrocious poetry than the New Yorker
(discounting Ashbery and a few anomalous pieces that slip in) is The Nation.
 Granted they often have decent book reviews, but the poems are
embarassing--this is what the politically progressive and radical readership
has to eat as poetry. There should be dietary laws....

swiveled sweat imagination, still mine habits art driftwood-draped
emptied head went away like a Venusian waving gaily out the spaceship window

    everywhere on the radio, interpretation is overlooked
          the channel is slipping, confidence can well afford it
          looking out like the statue his strength kept current
    as was bidden by the bone-setters, gripped with a knack for
                          war-psychosis...

             you have to start it just for the record, only
                          making it lewder
             betrayal isolated on the spur of his years
                       engaged eccentricities
                          go for caution

                  it was time to go, old spoilsport
       the miseries of this Hurlothrumbo period pray for disguise

Actually--she didn't. That was Edward Burns who let her in.



Here I thought Ulla Dydo an eminently sensible person as well as a
brilliant Stein scholar.  But you have to have rocks in your head to invite
Janet "The Punisher" Malcolm into your apartment.  Hasn't she ever seen any
Hammer films?  Once you invite one over your threshold, you're mince meat!!!

Kirby:

You make some excellent points. We're all confused, but that's the point.
People who think they know the right course for others are blind to
themselves. Complexity is an attribute of the Postmodern God.
Even if Iraq heals, America is not on a path to heal itself, but on one
that, daily, is creating more internal, and external, bleeding. We need a
revolution in consciousness first, in ethics, then, before politics can
begin make sense.

Thanks Stephen.

Isn't there something there in Barney's work (all over it, really) that in
some way *celebrates* some perceived higher-order beauty in all the madness
and exploitation of the Machine?  Is it not then unsurprising, then, that
for Cremaster 3 Barney won the first Hugo Boss Prize?  Hugo Boss the member
of the Nazi Party who designed those Nazi military uniforms, jack boots and
all?  Wondrous exploitative fetishism, put to work for the grandiose and
malignant (and at least partly Masonic, interestingly enough) causes of the
SS?  I can understand a philosophical acceptance of the Machine, of
accepting the way things are, but not without a simultaneous rejection of
and resistance to that Machine.  Just to contextualize Barney's work, it's
the Freemasons and Skull and Bones that at least indirectly provided Barney
with a significant amount of his money.  But enough with the externals.  I
guess I just wanted Barney's work to do more.  For me the Cremaster films
seem to further legitimize the Big Machine and the Rules of the Game.

I find it a bit disappointing that sexual repression and forced gender roles
function in Barney's work as part of a higher and more beautiful order,
purposed for a greater and more gorgeous end, and that the most perfect
release from the chains of such repression is through the myth of Hiram
Abiff the Master Mason conflated into a story of the building of the
Chrysler building (Cremaster 3).  That the Master Mason is fellow Yaleie
Richard Serra is not at all suspect, clubby even?  Maybe it's a joke wink
wink but there you have it: wink wink (ho hum).

All that vaseline for Barney seems to make sense only in the context of the
masonic myth and the its resonance with male sexual frustration (e.g., the
bar made of cooled vaseline with the masonic tools in the middle) and just
benefits the status quo.  The machine entering the body in all of its holes.
There's nothing very critical or culturally ambitious about it.  It's almost
as if Barney brought the production values of a cutting-edge Hollywood
sci-fi film (I can't help but see the white spaceships of Star Wars in my
mind's eye when seeing Barney's work) to the art world.  More money, more
surface, more complacency, less insight.  Chilled Vaseline "gives good
face": it has a sort of marvelous plastic pearlescence.

I honestly don't find his work shocking or upsetting or obscene in the
least.  Not in the art world.  Call me a jaded observer.  I don't even find
Nan Goldin's more recent work obscene (which I saw in Chelsea NYC in late
March) any more, but instead tired, cheap, exploitative, pathetic.
Obscenity was writ large in the 70s and 80s art universe, from Acconci's
jacking off performance piece to Piss Christ, that controversial crucifix in
a jar of piss.  It's hard to top 20 years of offenses.  (Personally I like
the challenge....)  I can easily find much more ambitiously offensive art in
Kent Johnson's "Miseries of Poetry" or in Gabe Gudding's doodie-talk.

I do however find Barney's work sumptuous, seductive: a world I want to fuck
in, dine in, sleep in, dream in.  The Beauty of the Machine.  The Perfect
Madison Avenue Moment.  And I find his work extraordinarily polished as
well.  I wish visual artists would at least take a page from Barney's book
of craft, use it as a sort of standard of surface beauty.

I found the best material juxtaposition was the black wedding satin.  I want
to *live* in that room, but it's the sort of room that has the appearance of
requiring some sins in exchange for its ownership, the sort of atrocities
that mark the halls of power and domination.  But that satin is gorgeous.
Sullied purity.  Is it confounding or reinforcing such categories?

To be honest I'm having some serious doubts about my own line of
questioning, particularly when it comes to Barney's examinations of sexual
and gender differentiation, because I think they play on assumptions that I
find to be stupid in the first place.  I want to avoid silly discussions of
*artistic intent*:  I'm incredibly skeptical of the wave of critics
chattering about "Barney's personal cosmology."   Such criticism serves to
mystify the work and hold it up (on a pedestal? hmmm) as if the work and the
artist were above us, out of reach, greater than us, deified and canonized.
Instead I want to consider how Barney's Cremaster Cycle functions, the
structures from which it oozes and the architectures into which it seeps.

"Indulging the obscene baroque": good phrase, Stephen.  I think we can find
it in Peter Greenaway's films as well, though in a much more conventional,
and dare I say, less stylistic way?  Never thought I'd say Greenaway's work
was less stylistic than someone else's.

Thanks Patrick, also for this. Love the Zappa song ref.
Barney is not about to enter or win a "dry wall" masonry building
competition!
There is that wonderfully squeamish fecal and/or spermatic side to Barney's
work - that viscerally connects to the usually shocked sight of the parent
who discovers his young young child in the bath tub joyously playing boats
or whatever with his poops.

Then he does refine the surfaces, as you suggest, and loves to collide
contrary material surfaces, leather to metal, etc.

"Indulging the obscene Baroque" is the fancy crit phrase that the B "oeuvre"
does bring to mind, well, at least my mind.

I'm sure they understand that the weekly Calvin Trillin "Deadline
Poet" piece is doggerel. Trillin is almost proud in claiming the term
when he talks about it.

But the magazine less frequently (once or twice a month) also
publishes poetry further back, in the "Books & the Arts" section,
that they clearly don't think of as doggerel, by some of the same
writers you see in the New Yorker, and also offers an annual juried
prize in poetry.

U.S. Insiders Say Iraq Intel Deliberately Skewed



By Jim Wolf

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A growing number of U.S. national security
professionals are accusing the Bush administration of slanting the facts
and hijacking the $30 billion intelligence apparatus to justify its rush
to war in Iraq (news - web sites).



A key target is a four-person Pentagon (news - web sites) team that
reviewed material gathered by other intelligence outfits for any missed
bits that might have tied Iraqi President Saddam Hussein (news - web
sites) to banned weapons or terrorist groups.



This team, self-mockingly called the Cabal, "cherry-picked the
intelligence stream" in a bid to portray Iraq as an imminent threat,
said Patrick Lang, a former head of worldwide human intelligence
gathering for the Defense Intelligence Agency, which coordinates
military intelligence.


The DIA was "exploited and abused and bypassed in the process of making
the case for war in Iraq based on the presence of WMD," or weapons of
mass destruction, he added in a phone interview. He said the CIA (news -
web sites) had "no guts at all" to resist the allegedly deliberate
skewing of intelligence by a Pentagon that he said was now dominating
U.S. foreign policy.


Vince Cannistraro, a former chief of Central Intelligence Agency (news -
web sites) counterterrorist operations, said he knew of serving
intelligence officers who blame the Pentagon for playing up "fraudulent"
intelligence, "a lot of it sourced from the Iraqi National Congress of
Ahmad Chalabi."


The INC, which brought together groups opposed to Saddam, worked closely
with the Pentagon to build a for the early use of force in Iraq.


"There are current intelligence officials who believe it is a scandal,"
he said in a telephone interview. They believe the administration,
before going to war, had a "moral obligation to use the best information
available, not just information that fits your preconceived ideas."


CHEMICAL WEAPONS REPORT 'SIMPLY WRONG'


The top Marine Corps officer in Iraq, Lt. Gen. James Conway, said on
Friday U.S. intelligence was "simply wrong" in leading military
commanders to fear troops were likely to be attacked with chemical
weapons in the March invasion of Iraq that ousted Saddam.


Richard Perle, a Chalabi backer and member of the Defense Policy Board
that advises Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld, defended the four-person
unit in a television interview.


"They established beyond any doubt that there were connections that had
gone unnoticed in previous intelligence analysis," he said on the PBS
NewsHour Thursday.


A Pentagon spokesman, Marine Lt. Col. David Lapan, said the team in
question analyzed links among terrorist groups and alleged state
sponsors and shared conclusions with the CIA.


"In one case, a briefing was presented to Director of Central
Intelligence Tenet. It dealt with the links between Iraq and al Qaeda,"
the group blamed for the Sept. 2001 attacks on the United States, he
said.


Tenet denied charges the intelligence community, on which the United
States spends more than $30 billion a year, had skewed its analysis to
fit a political agenda, a cardinal sin for professionals meant to tell
the truth regardless of politics.


"I'm enormously proud of the work of our analysts," he said in a
statement on Friday ahead of an internal review. "The integrity of our
process has been maintained throughout and any suggestion to the
contrary is simply wrong."


Tenet sat conspicuously behind Secretary of State Colin Powell (news -
web sites) during a key Feb. 5 presentation to the U.N. Security Council
arguing Iraq represented an ominous and urgent threat -- as if to lend
the CIA's credibility to the presentation, replete with satellite
photos.


Powell said Friday his presentation was "the best analytic product that
we could have put up."


SHAPED 'FROM THE TOP DOWN'

Greg Thielmann, who retired in September after 25 years in the State
Department, the last four in the Bureau of Intelligence and Research
working on weapons, said it appeared to him that intelligence had been
shaped "from the top down."

"The normal processing of establishing accurate intelligence was
sidestepped" in the runup to invading Iraq, said David Albright, a
former U.N. weapons inspector who is president of the Institute for
Science and International Security and who deals with U.S. intelligence
officers.

Anger among security professionals appears widespread. Veteran
Intelligence Professionals for Sanity, a group that says it is made up
mostly of CIA intelligence analysts, wrote to U.S. President George Bush
May 1 to hit what they called "a policy and intelligence fiasco of
monumental proportions."

"In intelligence there is one unpardonable sin -- cooking intelligence
to the recipe of high policy," it wrote. "There is ample indication this
has been done with respect to Iraq."

Bill,

I will admit that there were some gross ambiguities in my last post.

Of course, M&V wouldn't claim that rocks are cognizant; I should not have
said "everything," but "every living thing." And yes, even the basic slime
molds!

The difficulty coming to M&V, however, is to really understand what they
mean by 'reality.' I concur that it would be absurd for a pair of biologists
to deny external reality! For them reality is constructed by the organism
(autopoietic system) as a result of it's interaction with the world. Because
our interaction with the world is dependant upon, among other things, our
physical structure, nervous system, and most importantly our role as
observers 'reality' is somewhat relative. The point in this regard is not
that 'external reality' doesn't exist, but that it is not absolute. If you'd
like a reference for this, here is a link:
http://www.enolagaia.com/LetLen&Bas(1997).html
And for a wonderful library of information on autopoiesis:
http://www.informatik.umu.se/~rwhit/AT.html (though the guy running the site
belongs to the US military - is autopoiesis as an idea split in the manner
of cybernetics?)

Languaging, you're right, is orienting behavior and is dependent upon the
interactions between two or more individuals. And in this regard does make
an interesting compliment to your point about language. However, I think
there is more at play in meaning making than just language. For M&V so
called "emotioning" is at the root of language, and beneath this is a whole
bundle of ideas about the person, the person's particular placement in a
particular environment, the person's relationship with her body, and the
body's organization itself.

According to M&A, as far as I understand them, structure does play a large
part in what an organism can and can't do ("what an organism will do is
limited by what it can do"), but its role as an observer is also critical.
In the "Tree of Knowledge" they relate the story of the Bengali (Indian?)
"Wolf Children"  as an example of the role of the observer and the organism.
The two girls in question of course were human physiologically, but because
they were raised by wolves and had no other human contact, behaved as a
wolfs (running on all fours, eating raw meat from the floor, rising with the
opossums,  etc) in all respects. After they were recovered (taken?), one of
them died -  M&V paint the death as a result of emotional separation from
her wolf family as I remember - and the other learned to walk on two legs
(but preferred all fours) and, I think, speak a little. This would indicate
to me a fair deal of structural adaptability, rather than the determinism
you suppose.

Of course, there is plenty beyond language that is knowable. If you remember
Hume's formulation of experience, i.e. we can't know anything until we've
had an impression of it, it was pointed out (by who, I completely forget)
that were we to look at a shaded color scheme and one shade was taken out,
even if we had not had the experience of it, we would still notice it's
absence. Is this any different for language?


My point is not that language is unimportant for forming abstract thoughts,
in fact I agree wholeheartedly! But it is not necessary for awareness - or
cognition, if you prefer. When one acts with language, there is much else
going on environmentally and biologically that shades production and
understanding (even idiolect does not go far enough).  To the extent that we
have this recursive relationship with the environment, so too do we have
this relationship with language, which is environmental, after all. That
gives language an important position, no doubt, but not hegemony.

Anyhow, it seems Steven has actually already said most of this, and much
more eloquently.

Best,
Ben

Joel . . . Kirby . . . (and indirectly, Mark) . . .

Please allow me to respectfully disagree with your most recent posts to the
Buffalo Poetics List.

I'm confused about many things -- among them, love, sex, poetry -- but one
of the few things I'm not confused about (and have NEVER been confused
about) has been the absolute idiocy, venality and corruption of the Baby
Bush administration.

"September 11" -- rather than change anything -- only cemented that idee
fixe. (I can give you websites. If you don't know them already, I'd rather
not.)

(What was confusing was, you know, "Twin Peaks" -- in 1992 -- but since then
((and after just seeing the prequel on IFC}} -- not much, sorry.)

What -- is it some central idea of post-modernism that one has to be
confused now?

These assholes MEAN IT! They're not the "loyal opposition" -- they're
homicidal, ignorant, short-sighted, born-again EMPIRE MONGERS . . . this is
serious business!

"Oh, is it really that bad? Hasn't it been bad before? Can't I just go on
blogging?" "Oh, the blogging community is SO misunderstood."

Total Information Awareness has been changed to "Terrorist Information
Awareness" . . . Oh! Great! It's OK now!!!

I mean . . . you've read "Bernard Lewis"???? Kirby -- you seem like an
intelligent young man (unless, of course, you used to live in Seattle and
we've met) -- but really, there is absolutely NO reason to be confused about
some things; our invasion of Iraq was absolutely, positively, morally,
politically, aesthetically (and any other "ly" you can think of) . . .
WRONG.

"I am unequivocally opposed to the war against Iraq" -- Barry Watten. (And
who, knowing anything about me, would ever think that I would ever be
quoting Barry with approval?) Hi Barry. I liked your piece about the 60s.
I'll write to you about it soon.

The growing questions about no weapons of mass destruction (just surfacing
*now*!) is a start, a nice little puncture wound in the so far bulletproof
vest of Official Orthodoxy, but still only a very small impediment; Robert
Byrd's recent speech (surely available on google now) about the truth
eventually coming out still seems impossibly idealistic. How any conscious,
sentient human can be "confused" about what's occurred so far this century
is absolutely mind-boggling to me.

To take just the recent invasion -- maybe the majority of the people in Iraq
who are still alive will eventually gather together and form some sort of
half-assed only moderately corrupt state with only minimal direction from
its overlords -- it's possible. Would that prove us "right" to have done
this? Do the ends . . . fellow Marxists . . . really justify the means?

So Mark, everyone on this list isn't in such lock-step agreement as you
surmise. As witness, these quotes . . .

"Mark, your point is very interesting here.  The reason I'm not talking
about the war is that I feel abysmally ignorant about that part of the world
(as well as most other things).  Since the WTC attack I've read Bernard
Lewis, . . ."

Technological Dispersion - dispersing technologies like wireless PDA,
cellphone, etc. People make their audiences as they go along; think of all
the webcams out there for example. I see this networking - AIM etc. as
well - as producing free-flowing literatures, videos, interactivities, far
removed from artists.

I find it useful summarizing a lot of people; he does well with Lawrence

Cellular in general, WiFi etc. Rheingold believes for better or worse that
these technologies will outpace the Net, just as the Net has outpaced
print. I tend to agree with him. I did a lot of in-town CB radio
monitoring and analysis in the 80s, seeing new forms of communication
appear that had nothing to do with language as we know it, for example
repetitive signoffs that would run for 10-15 minutes.

Of course I agree with you here. I wasn't thinking of Rheingold - I'm not
sure he goes into this. But it's something I've noticed repeatedly; it
began with the phone and, for example, anti-phone-spam laws in some states
like New York.

It highly depends on the list. Cybermind has remained a community, even
with several posters 'issuing' daily. No one talks at each other there.
I'd say the same for imitationpoetics. There is a 'natural history' of
lists posts that has been going around since the early 90s - I think it
still holds. Lists are incredibly fluid, and their behavior depends on
topic, moderation, community, list crises, governance back-channel and
on-list, etc.

Because it won't be the characteristics of the dispersion, but the
characteristics of the residue, in part determined by community, that will
create the quality and content of what's being distributed/dispersed.

Nope, the New York Review of Books tops (bottoms) them all. Witht the one
virtue that they rarely publish more than two poems in an issue.

There's an interesting piece in the current (June) Harper's, "The Last
Americans: Environmental Collapse and the End of Civilization," by Jared
Diamond, a professor of geography and environmental health services at UCLA.
He speaks to ancient civilizations and how they collapsed because of their
depletion of their environment, and relates this to our current situation.

George,

You are clearly an optimist.  If we Americans could stop thinking of
ourselves as top dog, both global watchdog (however ridiculous) and
morally superior to everyone else in terms of human rights and others,
then maybe we could start really healing the very real rifts in this
country -- maybe we really could have a country of the people, by the
people, for the people.  Maybe.  I'm not so sure.  But I'm sure that
this attitude of the American Century gets in our way.  So many people
out of work!!!!!

CPoeticos,

Here are some notes I've made toward getting a handle on how poetry flows in
the brain.  I'd appreciate any comments you might have.

Thanks,

BB

============================

Time, Consciousness, and Poetry

Let us start with Walter Freemans observation that consciousness occurs in
discrete moments lasting on the order of 100-130 msec. Each moment consists
in electrical activity that spans an entire hemisphere. The moments in the
two hemipsheres are independent of one another. In order to estimate the
number of moments of consciousness that transpire during Kubla Khan I read
the poem aloud several times and timed my reading using a stop watch. The
table below show six timings. The first column is the duration of the
reading in seconds; the  second column is the number of moments at the rate
of 7/second.

seconds    moments

137        959
128        896
129        903
142        994
139        973
134        938

Thus we have between 900 and 1000 moments of consciousness needed to perform
Kubla Khan. Actually, its double that, since each hemisphere has its own
stream of moments. So what?  What I think is that its reasonable to think
about what those moments are needed for.

Lets start with Wallace Chafes Discourse, Consciousness, and Time. He
talks about the substantive intonation unit as a basic unit of discourse.
His notion is that the (fragment of an) idea to be rendered into speech is
present in consciousness at the beginning of the intonation unit. It is then
rendered into speech in one all-but-irrevocable action that is about five
words long in his sample. You can abort the rendering for whatever reason,
resulting in a fragmentary unit. Otherwise, the idea is rendered into speech
and were ready for another one  or to relinquish conversational turn. As
the substantive intonation unit is roughly equivalent to a line of poetry, I
will simply refer to a line.

Kubla Khan consists of 54 lines; assuming Chafe is correct, that accounts
for 5% of our conscious moments. Further, KK has a rich rhyme scheme,
requiring attention to line ends. Lets say thats another 5% accounted for.
Further, while line beginnings and endings are distant from one another on
the page, they are, of course, cheek-by-jowl in performance. So, weve got a
lot of obligatory action at relatively fixed points in the poem (though KK
uses a variety of line lengths).

Let us get a reasonably skilled reader to recite the poem while hooked up to
Freemans EEG machine. Well record the reading and the EEG. Will those line
breaks exhibit a distinctive signature in the EEG?  I do not know, but its
something to look for. But theres surely more.

For example, consider these lines, from the middle of the first movement:

And from this chasm, with ceaseless turmoil seething
As if this earth in fast thick pants were breathing,
A mighty fountain momently was forced:
Amid whose swift half-intermitted burst
Huge fragements vaulted like rebounding hail,
Of chaffy grain beneath the thresher's flail:
And 'mid these dancing rocks at once and ever
It flung up momently the sacred river.

As Reuven Tsur and I have independently observed, syntax and rhyme are out
of synch here. Synctactically we have two triplets followed by a couplet;
but the rhyme is four rhymed couplets. This is the only place in the first
movement where syntax and rhyme get out of synch. The second movement
exhibits the same form, a middle section of desynchronization flanked by two
synchronized sections.  Would this pattern show up in the EEG?

Recall that Freeman has observed that the two hemispheres have independent
moments of consciousness. One might speculate that the left hemisphere is
handling language syntax while the right is dealing with rhyme (and other
sound patterning). What happens to the relationship between the hemispheres
as Coleridge plays with syntax/sound synchrony?

Now lets do the same with This Lime-Tree Bower My Prison. LTB is a bit
longer than KK, and consists entirely of unrhymed pentameter. Would its EEG
signature thus be distinctly different from KKs?  Again, I do not know.

Surely these different phenomena involve different neural dynamics. Thats
not the issue. The issue is whether or not we can detect some of these
differences in EEG recordings. Its rather like trying to deduce the
mechanical features of an engine by listening to the noise it makes in
different operating conditions. The noise is simply a side-effect of its
operation, but it is systematically correlated with engine events. If you
cant look directly at those engine events, then listen to the noise.

The point of using poetry in EEG investigation of brain function is that it
is highly structured and thus more likely to provoke distinct electrical
signatures. The point of comparing KK traces with LTB traces is that they
are so distinctly different that we have some reasonable hope of being able
to related differences in EEG signature to differences in the poems.

tom, for what it's worth, i counted 1,132 moments of consciousness in
reading through this rather fascinating report -- about the same as what
it takes for me to get through an entire William Saffire article in the
Times magazine

CPoeticos,

Here are some notes I've made toward getting a handle on how poetry
flows in the brain.  I'd appreciate any comments you might have.

Thanks,

BB

=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=
=3D=3D=3D

Time, Consciousness, and Poetry

Let us start with Walter Freeman=B9s observation that consciousness =
occurs
in discrete moments lasting on the order of 100-130 msec. Each moment
consists in electrical activity that spans an entire hemisphere. The
moments in the two hemipsheres are independent of one another. In order
to estimate the number of moments of consciousness that transpire during
=B3Kubla Khan=B2 I read the poem aloud several times and timed my =
reading
using a stop watch. The table below show six timings. The first column
is the duration of the reading in seconds; the  second column is the
number of moments at the rate of 7/second.

seconds    moments

137        959
128        896
129        903
142        994
139        973
134        938

Thus we have between 900 and 1000 moments of consciousness needed to
perform =B3Kubla Khan.=B2 Actually, it=B9s double that, since each =
hemisphere
has its own stream of moments. So what?  What I think is that it=B9s
reasonable to think about what those moments are needed for.

Let=B9s start with Wallace Chafe=B9s Discourse, Consciousness, and Time. =
He
talks about the substantive intonation unit as a basic unit of
discourse. His notion is that the (fragment of an) idea to be rendered
into speech is present in consciousness at the beginning of the
intonation unit. It is then rendered into speech in one
all-but-irrevocable action that is about five words long in his sample.
You can abort the rendering for whatever reason, resulting in a
fragmentary unit. Otherwise, the idea is rendered into speech and =
we=B9re
ready for another one =AD or to relinquish conversational turn. As the
substantive intonation unit is roughly equivalent to a line of poetry, I
will simply refer to a line.

=B3Kubla Khan=B2 consists of 54 lines; assuming Chafe is correct, that
accounts for 5% of our conscious moments. Further, KK has a rich rhyme
scheme, requiring attention to line ends. Let=B9s say that=B9s another =
5%
accounted for. Further, while line beginnings and endings are distant
from one another on the page, they are, of course, cheek-by-jowl in
performance. So, we=B9ve got a lot of obligatory action at relatively
fixed points in the poem (though KK uses a variety of line lengths).

Let us get a reasonably skilled reader to recite the poem while hooked
up to Freeman=B9s EEG machine. We=B9ll record the reading and the EEG. =
Will
those line breaks exhibit a distinctive signature in the EEG?  I do not
know, but it=B9s something to look for. But there=B9s surely more.

For example, consider these lines, from the middle of the first
movement:

And from this chasm, with ceaseless turmoil seething
As if this earth in fast thick pants were breathing,
A mighty fountain momently was forced:
Amid whose swift half-intermitted burst
Huge fragements vaulted like rebounding hail,
Of chaffy grain beneath the thresher's flail:
And 'mid these dancing rocks at once and ever
It flung up momently the sacred river.

As Reuven Tsur and I have independently observed, syntax and rhyme are
out of synch here. Synctactically we have two triplets followed by a
couplet; but the rhyme is four rhymed couplets. This is the only place
in the first movement where syntax and rhyme get out of synch. The
second movement exhibits the same form, a middle section of
desynchronization flanked by two synchronized sections.  Would this
pattern show up in the EEG?

Recall that Freeman has observed that the two hemispheres have
independent moments of consciousness. One might speculate that the left
hemisphere is handling language syntax while the right is dealing with
rhyme (and other sound patterning). What happens to the relationship
between the hemispheres as Coleridge plays with syntax/sound synchrony?

Now let=B9s do the same with =B3This Lime-Tree Bower My Prison.=B2 LTB =
is a
bit longer than KK, and consists entirely of unrhymed pentameter. Would
its EEG signature thus be distinctly different from KKs?  Again, I do
not know.

Surely these different phenomena involve different neural dynamics.
That=B9s not the issue. The issue is whether or not we can detect some =
of
these differences in EEG recordings. It=B9s rather like trying to deduce
the mechanical features of an engine by listening to the noise it makes
in different operating conditions. The noise is simply a side-effect of
its operation, but it is systematically correlated with engine events.
If you can=B9t look directly at those engine events, then listen to the
noise.

The point of using poetry in EEG investigation of brain function is that
it is highly structured and thus more likely to provoke distinct
electrical signatures. The point of comparing KK traces with LTB traces
is that they are so distinctly different that we have some reasonable
hope of being able to related differences in EEG signature to
differences in the poems.

Dear Bill Austin,

It may be true that I have rocks in my head for trying to express anything but
the party line in regard to Iraq (and the rocks would therefore be a form of
consciousness), but I wanted to get back to a more peaceful topic with a more
civil interlocuter (thanks to Kazim Ali and Mark Weiss and the others willing to
provide room for discussion, though!).

I was thinking about the Principia Mathematica, which I've never read, but a
math scholar once told me on a plane trip that what Russell was attempting to do
was to verify, or prove, that one plus one equals two.  After ten years he
realized he couldn't do it, and the way this was glossed was that Russell
realized there was no such thing as two of any one thing.  So, even two Eberhard
#2 pencils, fresh out of the factory, are not the same.  They occupy different
points in time and space, and they will have different futures: different kids
chewing on them, and so on.

So from this I got thinking -- that even basic math doesn't really describe the
world but is dependent on stereotypes.  "One" being a stereotype.  Like, there
are all kinds of different shades of blue (I didn't quite understand the shading
issue, but missed the original post) but we still say the word blue to cover
them when we say the "blue" car just went past.

Meanwhile, Eyes are for looking, Charles Olson keeps saying.

Then he says on p. 40 of the Maximus Poems (this seems to be a common text to
most people reading on this board?):

"There may be no more names than there are objects
There can be no more verbs than there are actions."

I think what he means by this is that words come AFTER objects, or AFTER
actions, and name them.

So the real is first.

And eyes are for looking out of, means that there's something out there.  He
keeps throughout the poem talking about the sea, and sailors, and going back to
Homer, and trying to even get before that, to a time when action was the thing.
I think this is also what he's trying to get at with his interest in SPACE.

Pound was working in a similar vein (I think) when in the ABC of Reading he was
talking about how Louis Agassiz wanted his students to really look at a sunfish,
and not be trapped in the verbiage that they had inherited, but to keep looking
at it, and to see its endless complexity.  (Perhaps this is even Keats' negative
capability?)  Holding the mind open as long as possible instead of jumping to an
easy conclusion to get rid of the problems of what I guess would be called today
cognitive dissonance.

The little paragraph is on the bottom of p. 17 of the ABC.  It's a very strong
paradigm that sticks with you, and I'm sure you remember it, but I'm typing it
in for anybody whose copy is in storage:

"No man is equipped for modern thinking until he has understood the anecdote of
Agassiz and the fish:

     A post-graduate student equipped with honours and diplomas went to Agassiz
to receive the final and finishing touches.  The great man offered him a small
fish and told him to describe it.
     Post-Graduate Student: 'That's only a sunfish.'
    Agassiz:  'I know that.  Write a description of it.'
    After a few minutes the student returned with the description of the Ichthus
Heliodiplodokus, or whatever term is used to conceal the common sunfish from
vulgar knowledge, family of Heliichtherinkus, etc., as found in textbooks of the
subject.
    Agassiz again told the student to describe the fish.
    The student produced a four-page essay.  Agassiz then told him to look at
the fish.  At the end of three weeks the fish was in an advanced state of
decomposition, but the student knew something about it." (Chapter One 16-17).

It seems to me that what both Pound and Olson are saying is that there's
something outside of language, and that the first thing is to look and
experience, and only then language begins.

Perhaps they're mistaken.

Or perhaps I'm mistaken about them. Maybe even Agassiz was mistaken?  Or maybe
Pound misunderstood Agassiz.

It just seems to me that words are useful stereotypes that can help us begin to
communicate across the incommunicability of actual experience, but that words
are a kind of simple tool developed by a still relatively simple species, in
order to understand and communicate about a very complex world.  We're so
simple.  I feel that almost everything remains a mystery, and will remain.
We're like cats watching a movie, and trying to get the plot.

By the way are you related to the important British philosopher of language
whose name if I recall is J.L. Austin?

Hi, All--

For an interesting twist on new ways to raise consciousness toward questions
of ethics and political action, has anyone else had a look around this
website?

Alan--I'm intrigued as to why you chose a Hawaiian text for your
Philosophy and Colonialism piece.  Can you say more about this piece,
what the source text was, why you chose it, why you thought it
important to include the Hawaiian (which I'm presuming you don't speak)
and so on.  I'm intrigued that it begins with the word "hanai," since
I'm very interested in native Hawaiian hanai practice.

In 1971, I think, Berio came to Santa Fe to oversee
the premier of his work "opera" at the Santa Fe Opera.
 With him came the company of the Open Theater, the
next wave, so to speak, of the Living Theater with
many of the same participants. The Open Theater
production featured some of it's most famous
creations, the Monster being the one that comes to
mind.  In the middle of the opera a group of terrified
children huddled on the stage and cried and moaned.
The highly conventional Santa Fe Opera audience was
appalled.  People stood and yelled at the stage, threw
things, and walked out in droves. It was a great
moment in music and politics.
Several members of the Open Theater, most notably Lee
Worley and Dale Whitt, stayed on in Santa Fe and
formed a new company, "Wit's End", of which I was a
member.  We performed for roughly 5 years,  with a
shifting crew, doing increasingly anarchic
improvisation-based theater. The need to eat meant we
all worked day jobs and eventually couldn't stay awake
long enough to keep doing our highly physical brand of
theater..
"Opera" was our inspiration. Berio's powerful,
mind-bending music cried out for controled anarchy.

Just kidding you, George. "Unhelpful" and related words
are Bush/Rummy-speak for such things as expressions of
opposition, street demonstrations, etc. etc.
