The Lenny Paschen monologue, from The Lenny Paschen Show
The three librettos I wrote for Ben Yarmolinsky in the early 1990s =20
used vernacular American forms to create contemporary operas with a =20
social and historical address. Blind Witness News (1990) and The Lenny =20=

Paschen Show (1992) used the typical format of late-night TV, while =20
The Subject (1991) starts with a psychoanalytic session.

Lenny is the final work of the trilogy. Much of the opening monologue, =20=

to be presented at this event, was cut, for reasons of length, from =20
the final libretto.

In its typical process of canceling sense, television is, of course, =20
the offense to meaning that is addressed in The Lenny Paschen Show. =20
Lenny Paschen is a gladiator in an electronic age=97a hot fighter in a =20=

cool medium (and he may also cut against the grain of the lyric =20
impulse within opera). Lenny is trapped from the start, yet his =20
struggle for moral discourse makes this opera a fin de millennia =20
version of Die Meistersinger=97sans masters, sans paradise, all songs. =20=

Lenny seems to preach that we can get beyond the puppetry of TV =20
personas, but, as he also insists, he remains a puppet of his own =20
devices. The Lenny Paschen Show uses the tools at hand, especially the =20=

tradition of black, often abrasive, comedy to explore the worlds =20
flaunted by, and also hidden within, one of the central formats of =20
commercial TV.

As some of you know, I began work at the beginning of July as co-Executive
Director of the 31-year-old non-profit Friends of Ballona Wetlands, L.A.'s
preeminent wetlands education and restoration group.  To learn more about
us, go here: http://www.ballonafriends.org.

 One of the conditions of my signing was that I wanted the Friends to start
a blog, which I hope will be a DAILY destination for people who care about
wetlands preservation and the larger environmental/crisis of soul issues
that arise from habitat loss, urbanization, etc.  It's a broad subject, and
I will interpret it broadly.

The Friends board has approved my request to edit a five-to-seven-day-a-wee=
k
daily "magazine," to begin soon, with different segments/columnists each
day, like Monday essays, Tuesday local Ballona sightings and news, Wednesda=
y
local history, Thursday FAQs about wetlands (what's an "indicator species?"
etc.), Friday poetry, Saturday Best of Reader Contributions, and, maybe eve=
n
Sunday Comix and Opinion.

 Thus, this appeal to you for new, unpublished work, in poetry, fiction,
essays, art, book reviews, or even comics, that is somehow wetlands,
estuary, swamp, bog, fen, river, ocean, etc., oriented. Forests are probabl=
y
out, since we're a wetlands in a semi-desert ecosystem.

 I'd like to publish your original work (at the usual non-profit,
hat-in-hand rates, i.e. free) on the blog, and potentially in a "Best Of"
hard-copy anthology.  Those rights only; all other rights are yours.  I can
offer a reciprocal link to your blog, website, or book site, so you benefit
from networking.  Also, given enough notice, I often help out-of-town poets
I admire book readings in Los Angeles or San Francisco.  And finally, The
Friends have a few events of our own coming up, and I am trying to shake
loose funding from donors to pay readers.

Our blog audience is people who are concerned about environmental issues,
and who have varying degrees of literary sophistication.  I don't know that
concrete poetry will work, or that most of them could slog through *The
Cantos* without a playbook, but I am certain that (off the top of my head,
in no particular order) *In a Station of the Metro* would fly, as would
Stevens' *Anecdote of Men By the Thousands*, Rilke's *The Way In*, Oliver's
*Some Questions You Might Ask*, Pattiann Rogers' *Dream of the Marsh Wren*,
Abani's *Muir Woods*, Kabir's *The Clay Jug*, Lisa Jarnot's *Everything I
Know About Corn*, Yusef Komunyakaa's *Ode to the Maggot*, Harryette Mullen'=
s
*Kills Bugs Dead*, Ritsos' *The Models*, Levertov's *The Reminder*, Ursula
K. Le Guin's *Riding on the Coast Starlight*, Richard Shelton's *Sonora for
Sale*, David St. John's *Iris, *even Jack Gilbert's *Haunted Importantly*
=85etc.

My bias is toward "ecopoetry," which is not nature poetry, per se, but much
harder to define.  James Englehardt, in an essay in Octopus Magazine <
http://www.octopusmagazine.com/issue09/engelhardt.htm>, suggests this:  The
ecopoem is connected to the world, and this implies responsibility.  Like
other poetic models that assume a connection and engagement (feminism,
Marxism, witness, etc.), ecopoetry is surrounded by questions of
ethics.  Should
the ecopoem *do* something in the world?  But how can a poem be said to
accomplish anything?

Scott Bryson's book "Ecopoetry" also has a number of wonderful essays and
definitions.  But don't get too hung up in definitions; I'll know what I
like when I see it.

As for essayists, I'm looking for the next Wendell Berry, Barry Lopez,
Oliver Sacks, Lewis Thomas, Lynn Margulis and Dorion Sagan, Bill McKibben,
Michael Pollan, Terry Tempest Williams, Susan Griffin=97or all of *them* an=
d
more.  Good, straight-ahead stylists who combine clarity, lyricism, and
science.

As for fiction, I'm on less firm ground as an editor, but Kaaren Kitchell,
Antioch MFA and member of WOMPO, will be our fiction editor, so your work i=
s
in good hands.

AND, if you write reviews, I'm interested specifically in your reviews
of poetry collections that advance the craft and push the boundaries of
"nature" or "ecopoetry."

We have plenty of local photography, but if you have fine art or
illustrations, feel free to submit those or direct me to where on the
Web I can secure a quality JPEG.

I already have poetry submissions from Annie Finch,
Janet Burroway, Ron Koertge, Tony Barnstone, Ann Fisher-Wirth, Christopher
Merrill, Ellen Bass, C.J. Sage and Linda Pastan, to name just a handful, so
you will be in good company.

While I'm writing to you from a specific, unique place, the Ballona
Wetlands, consider my request an appeal from a juncture, if you will, of
soul and territory, a juncture that calls to mind one of my favorite quotes
from the poet/essayist Wendell Berry:

*This is the phenomenon of edge or margin that we know to be one of the
powerful attractions of a diversified landscape, both to wildlife and to
humans.  The human eye itself seems drawn to such margins, hungering for th=
e
difference made in the countryside by a hedgy fencerow, a stream, or a grov=
e
of trees.  And we know that these margins are biologically rich, the meetin=
g
of two kinds of habitat.***

Write to me from the rich margins where you and the outer world overlap.  A=
s
Novalis wrote, *The seat of the soul is where the inner world and the outer=
*
* **world meet.  Where they overlap, it is in every point of the** **
overlap.*

To the mundane:  Please submit, if you choose, documents in Microsoft Word,
any version before 2008.  I'm not sure we'll be able to deal with complex
formatting in poems, but I'll do my best.  MANDATORY:  With your
submission, write me a paragraph about your nearest estuary, wetlands,
swamp, bog, fen or most inspiring body of water to run in the introduction
to your piece, and tell ME specifically where it is.  I would like to link
our readers to the specific natural place that most moves and inspires our
contributors.  I may even put in a Google Map link to the area (one of our
contributors, Michael Salcman, sails Chesapeake Bay, for example; Janet
Burroway walks in Florida), as I would if I were running (I wish, but I
don't know how to reach her yet) a Mary Oliver poem and would spotlight
Provincetown on Cape Cod.

Again, if you want to see what the blog will look like, it will resemble th=
e
rest of our site, http://www.ballonafriends.org.  I look forward to
receiving your work.
Thank you,

Richard Beban

Diasporic Avant-Gardes draws into dialogue two=20
differing traditions of poetic practice: the=20
diasporic and the avant-garde.  This=20
interdisciplinary collection examines the=20
unacknowledged affinities (and crucial=20
differences) between avant-garde and diasporic=20
formal strategies and social formations. The=20
essays foreground the creation of experimental=20
forms and investigate the specific contexts of=20
cultural displacement and language use that inform their poetics.


Praise for Diasporic Avant-Gardes

=93This is an important, indeed a crucial project.=20
It will constitute a formative contribution to=20
the discussion of an expanded field of=20
contemporary poetics. The claim the essays make,=20
quite properly, amounts less to a positivity than=20
a negative solidarity that respects the radical=20
particularity of writers and/or movements while=20
noticing their common refusal of traditional=20
forms and identity politics. The aim in bringing=20
these essays together is to create dialogues=20
across difference that expose, nonetheless,=20
important strategic similarities among a variety=20
of radical experimental writings.=94=ADAdalaide=20
Morris, John C. Gerber Professor of English, University of Iowa

=93Diasporic Avant Gardes opens up innovative ways=20
of reading diasporic poetic texts in terms of=20
avant garde experimentation and goes even further=20
to suggest that avant gardes need to be read=20
diasporically.  It demonstrates convincingly the=20
importance of avant garde negation to the=20
earliest poetic experiments in the diaspora as=20
well as the close relation of avant garde=20
movements to the dislocations of European=20
colonization and global displacement. The result=20
is a superb collection of essays that=20
imaginatively merges the experimental and the=20
theoretical, a globalized imagination and=20
critical daring.=94=ADJ. Michael Dash, Professor of French, New York=
 University

=93This is an important book, among the best=20
critical anthologies I've read in recent years.=20
It is welcome proof that border crossing, of any=20
kind, is a creative act. In rich, varied ways the=20
contributors find form and feeling in what is=20
articulated along the border lines. Most=20
impressively, this volume itself, like the=20
subject it describes, functions as a contact=20
zone, where innovation as much as alienation=20
perform their dizzying, difficult dance.=94=ADAmitava=20
Kumar, author of Passport Photos

=93The thirteen splendid essays collected in this=20
volume delineate how surprising and unexpected=20
affinities link together diasporic and=20
avant-garde poetry: art forms that have emerged=20
from very different social locations and seem to=20
have incommensurable and irreconcilable goals.=20
Noland and Watten=92s generative collection enables=20
us to see that diasporic and avant garde poets=20
alike view domination, displacement, and=20
dispersal as central aspects of modernity, that=20
both groups resort to formal experimentation in=20
response to social instability.  By comparing and=20
contrasting the similar (although not identical)=20
ways that these poets artfully render the foreign=20
as familiar and the familiar as foreign,=20
Diasporic Avant Gardes shows how the people of=20
the world can be strangely united by the very=20
things that seem to divide us.=94=ADGeorge Lipsitz,=20

__________________________________
THEN, join us for a *Dialogues* writing lab, co-sponsored by Nonsite
collective, where Frank Sherlock and CAConrad discuss poetic interventions
into the present, past and future life of the city.

Saturday September 12, 2009
at 935 Natoma Street in San Francisco
(btwn. 10th and 11th and btwn. Mission and Howard)
Close to Van Ness and Market (Muni) or Civic Center (BART)
admission $25/$20 for SPT members and students

This from the leaders:

The City Real & Imagined project is a collaborative documentary of both
concrete and psychic place, exercising imaginations that are shared in the
commons. It is at heart a working of public space in a time of post-9/11
hegemonic decline. Preparations for the death of Baghdad's children had
begun, and the displacement of the working poor in Philadelphia was already
underway. Two poets with very different experiences within the same city
they share wandered together to let the streets shape the form of the poem
with its histories and possibilities. CAConrad and Frank Sherlock will
discuss their influences and approaches to the project, the collaborative
process, and the mutual impact on their re-imaginings of the Philadelphia
they live in.

For further investigation, visit the Nonsite Collective website for this:

Subject:      Chax Press presents new work by Joel Bettridge
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable

Dear Friends:



Joel Bettridge's new book, *Presocratic Blues*, has just been published by
Chax Press. You may order the book from our web site at http://chax.org, or
telephone us at 520-620-1626.





Reviews:

In *Presocratic Blues* the presocratics walk among us, obsessed with the
everyday: the rain, the bar, the blues. And the poems that result are full
of correspondence, of discovery in the Spicerian sense. These are poems tha=
t
remind us that behind every simple moment is a larger question about the
universe and humanity=E2=80=99s place in it.=E2=80=A8=E2=80=94 Juliana Spah=
r

In *Presocratic Blues*, Joel Bettridge takes us back home, back to that poo=
r
old actuality at the presocratic horizon of thought and matter. But we are
no happier for it. We go down to the river, a Heraclitan flux that just
keeps rolling, witness to despair and wicked deeds. These are sharply
intelligent poems, full of acerbic wit, absurdity, and heartbreak. =E2=80=
=94 Devin
Johnston

We breathe in Greek and exhale the pure products of Americana; a vernacular
philosophy. Joel Bettridge not only knows this but has strummed it in poems
witty, raucous, and bluesy. =E2=80=94 Charles Bernstein





Back Cover:



We now call them the Presocratics. Their writings come down to us in pieces=
:
Heraclitus claimed, =E2=80=9CYou cannot step twice into the same river, for=
 other
waters and yet others go ever flowing on=E2=80=9D; we have Zeno arguing tha=
t motion
does not exist, an arrow needing to go halfway to the target before strikin=
g
it, but needing to go half way of that half way first, and so on. In how
they were right in the wrongest ways, and wrong in the rightest we hear our
better thoughts; their fragments call to mind the blues: in their graves
perhaps, these philosophers hear themselves in its songs, for their singers=
,
too, glimpsed instances, like heartbreak, exhaustion, being broke, or drunk=
,
or trying to hold onto a faith; in these Hellenistic remnants we hear the
echoes of Blind Willie Johnson=E2=80=99s apologetics and Bessie Smith=E2=80=
=99s epistemology
of love. Anaxagoras also sang on steps advising passersby that all objects
contain elements of all other objects: the much bigger, for instance, has
the small in it, but it has mostly huge. They, like us, were between
religion and science=E2=80=94between the mysticism of the everyday and the =
shifting
ground of understanding. They too were smitten and baffled by what could be
seen and touched, and by events.

Dear all,

My thanks to the many who generously sent me citations for criticism on
lyric--

I ran across the following citation:

Antoine Caze, "Conceptual Lyricism: Abstract Constructions of the Self in
Recent American Poetry"
in Mark DuCharme's (great) essay "Radical Lyricality."

However, the essay is no longer at the web address listed. Any ideas about
where/how to get it? Or any of Caze's other works?

Thanks for any thoughts--Judith

Judith,

One text that I don't think has been mentioned, though perhaps I missed it:=
 Robert von Hallberg's *Lyric Power* (Chicago, 2008).

You are invited to attend two exciting events happening on Saturday,
September 12th --

The World Listening Project will facilitate a soundwalk which will happen by
and around the Michael Reese Hospital campus (10 a.m.-11 a.m.). Soundmarks
during this soundwalk will include the chainlink fence along the perimeter
of the Michael Reese Hospital campus; the wind in the trees in front of the
Singer Pavilion; a security guard's car tires rolling over gravel on the MRH
campus; traffic on Lake Shore Drive; demolition and earthmoving equipment
being operated at MRH; bikers, pedestrians, and automobile
drivers/passengers on the streets by MRH; and trains traveling the
north-south tracks (between MRH and LSD).

This soundwalk will start on the northwest corner of 31st St. and Cottage
Grove Dr. We will walk along the fenced-in perimeter of the MRH campus in a
clockwise direction, and then we will turn around and return to the
soundwalk's starting point. This soundwalk is free and open to the public;
it is being organized by Chad Clark, Jennifer Mosier, Norman Long, Eric
Leonardson, and Dan Godston.

Following the soundwalk, a Bauhaus9090 performance event will happen in
Chicago's Bauhaus District, beginning at 11:30 a.m. Jamie Kazay, Matthew
Barton, Amanda Marbais, Kevin Kilroy, and Dan Godston will read selections
of their poetry. Alpha Bruton will be painting in performance. This event
will happen in Lake Meadows Park (3117 S. Rhodes Ave., Chicago, IL 60616,
http://tinyurl.com/mksn77).

These events are free and open to the public.

RECENTLY CLOUDS by Jess Mynes and Aaron Tieger

Four years in the making, the long awaited followup to COLTSFOOT INSULARITY (Fewer & Further, 2005) sees these two poets and friends once again charting vernal manifestations in pastorals both interior and exterior. Written in correspondence in May, 2005, these poems mix and remix and emerge as a unique, faceted thing.

PHANTASMAL REPEATS by Guillermo Parra

Spare, abstract, thoughtful, the poems in PHANTASMAL REPEATS move sneakily within an insular, ambient framework. They are self-referential to an extent but still viscerally linked to the world at large.

Available in two eye-catching color schemes: red on curry or red on pool.

OUT ANOTHER by Michael Carr

In Michael Carr's OUT ANOTHER a mentholated wind blows the reader from deja to jamais vu and back, in a poemscape that lies distinctively in between. These poems, like continental noir, present a facade that may or may not be real.

END NOTEBOOK by Geoffrey Olsen

Of END NOTEBOOK, Brenda Iijima writes "Subtle ambient registrations accrue and gracefully dissipate in Geoff Olsen's End Notebook. Sensitive to atmospheric pressures these gestural phrasings shimmer. There is no subtext here but being, itself."

SUMMER POEMS by Aaron Tieger

Limited edition pamphlet. Short poems of heat and despair.

DOKUMENT by Catherine Meng

In a sequence populated by iconic and diverse figures from Peachy Peach and Glenn Gould to Bon Jovi and someone called Bullet, Meng writes a fragmentary lyricism informed by the book's epigraph (from Philip Roth): "It's impossible to report anything faithfully other than one's own temperature; everything is allegory."

Please visit http://www.petrichord.com for cover images, sample poems, and to purchase any of these titles.

Hi,

I've been meaning to reply to this, but can only do so briefly now--I
have no access to my books, which are in storage following a minor
natural disaster.

But according to some notes, see page 449 of the Scroggins bio for
details on the preparation of the index.

Following the trail of index entries for "a," "the," and "an" is an
interesting and frustrating enterprise, but it's interesting to note
that initial (no pun intended) citations of "a" in the index lead us to
instances related to Bach. As for "the," its first citation at page 175
quotes Paul Zukofsky saying "The horse bends down." And subsequent
instance of "the" seem to associate that article with family, Paul in
particular--but others might read these instances differently.

Or it might all turn out to be a numerical joke. The index cites 71
instances of "a," 73 of "the," and 40 of "an." That's 184 articles, or
in roman numerals CLXXXIV, which might indicate "Celia Louis 1934."
Those with Poem of a Life handy might track down possible details there.
According to Wickipedia, Celia and Louis met in '33, and Louis began
working for the WPA (on an index, as it happens) in 1934. But Wickipedia
is often imprecise.

Lots of interesting things happen in the index, which invites creative
speculation often difficult to support. E.g., the three words most
frequently cited in the index are, in descending order, "man," "eye,"
and "day." Call me crazy, but to my ears, these words--while naming
important "themes" in the poem--also partially echo the first words of
the Iliad -- "menin aiede." If Zukofsky didn't intend this echo (and he
probably didn't), he would have loved the serendipity.

More on this when I get my books back. It would be fun to keep this
thread alive: I don't understand why the index doesn't get more
attention. Panel somewhere, anyone?

Now, if one applies a word processor to that task -is that something to cry
or laugh over?

Zukofsky, processed out.

_______________


On Thursday, September 10th, 2009, IMRAM, the annual Irish-language
literary festival, will present a special evening of performances in
homage to the life & poetry of M=E1ire Mhac an tSaoi.

This event will take place at 6:30 p.m. at EAGLAIS =DAINIT=C9IREACH (the
Unitarian Church), 112 West St. Stephen=92s Green in Dublin, Ireland.

M=E1ire Mhac an tSaoi was born in 1922.  She is one of the most
important figures in contemporary Irish literature.  She has a
knowledge of the Munster dialect of Irish that is second-to-none.  Her
technical mastery of traditional forms melds with potent
self-expression to produce modern poetry of grace & delicacy.  Indeed,
the poetry of M=E1ire Mhac an tSaoi is centered, in the Zen sense of
centered.  Her collections of poetry include "Margadh na Saoire,"
"Codladh an Ghaisc=EDgh," "An Galar Dubhach," & "Shoa agus D=E1nta Eile."

Yes.  Illustrating why electronic copies of works are an important research
tool that publishers should make available, even to people who aren't going
to point powerful linguistics weighing & measuring tools at them.
And why learning to write an index and learning to word process index codes
and word counts / locations are two different things.  Um, as I played
around with in 2D&I.

For instance, Daniel Ladinsky's translations of the Persian poet Hafiz
(published by Penguin under the title *The Gift*) are pure inventions, not
one single translation having a corresponding version in Persion even though
the book sold in many thousands.

Subject:      Sheila Watson conference, University of Toronto, Oct 23-24, 2009

Registration is now open for a two day event at the University of St.

Sheila Watson. The event includes a reception, the opening of Watson's
Archives, a dramatic rendering of her classic The Double Hook, a formal
lunch with a toast by George Bowering, as well as three panels, one of
which consists of George Bowering, Elizabeth Hay (moderator), Daphne
Marlatt, Michael Ondaatje, and Jane Urquhart who will discuss Watsons
influence and legacy. Join us for what promises to be a not-to-be missed
event for anyone interested in Canadian literature and the arts.The cost

This regarding the workshop:

The City Real & Imagined project is a collaborative documentary of both
concrete and psychic place, exercising imaginations that are shared in the
commons. It is at heart a working of public space in a time of post-9/11
hegemonic decline. Preparations for the death of Baghdad's children had
begun, and the displacement of the working poor in Philadelphia was already
underway. Two poets with very different experiences within the same city
they share wandered together to let the streets shape the form of the poem
with its histories and possibilities. CAConrad and Frank Sherlock will
discuss their influences and approaches to the project, the collaborative
process, and the mutual impact on their re-imaginings of the Philadelphia
they live in.

Subject:      Poesia Eletr=?iso-8859-1?Q?=F4nica_?= by Jorge Luiz Antonio
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; format=flowed; charset="iso-8859-1";
              reply-type=original

Brazil's Jorge Luiz Antonio has published a book (which comes with a CD)
about "electronic poetry" called Poesia Eletrônica (198 pages). My
congratulations and thanks go out to him. Congratulations because I know he
has been working on this for many years and I know some of the trials and
tribulations he experienced through the process. Thanks because a visual
poem of mine is on the cover, the CD, and the interface to the CD-and the
art is printed and presented exceptionally well. So this is not an objective
notice about Jorge's book, but one from a friend of his.

The book (which is in Portuguese) contains a three-page preface in English
by Chris Funkhouser-who has written the first book on the history of digital
poetry. Among other things, Funkhouser looks at the way Antonio explores the
notion of how electronic poetry involves "negotiations with digital
processes":

"With software, the programming generally involves establishing frameworks
in which disparate elements-whether the different elements of a visual
scenario, or files that contain different verbal passages-negotiate with one
another, and are negotiated by the viewer. In the creation of
automatically-generated text, graphical works, or hypertexts, artists
present a virtual object that the user negotiates by plotting a course
through the multiple dimensions or constellations of language. When we
realize that all digital poetry involves some type of link, the importance
of negotiation is further heightened. In hypertext, the link (as in
node-to-node connection) is the primary mechanism by which a reader
negotiates text. In graphical and multimedia poems (which foreground sonic
and visual elements), different elements of the works are composed together
as simultaneities. Text-generators present another type of linking, between
the algorithm/program and the text as it comes to the reader. Links-literal
or conceptual-are always present in this extended environment; the
activation of computer coding creates a textual spark that is the foundation
on which any digital poem is built."
Chris Funkhouser

'Navigation' is related to 'negotiation' but they aren't quite the same
thing. 'Negotiation' encompasses 'navigation' but goes beyond it into
dialogue and protocol, for instance. It also involves the intermedial, as
Funkhouser points out, in negotiation between the elements of different
media. And there are other wheels for "electronic poetry in negotiation with
digital processes".

Although the book is largely in Portuguese, the CD contains much material in
English. There's an introduction by Jorge and, also, chapter 1 has been
translated into English.  Here is a passage from chapter 1:

"The technopoet is put, as the romantic poet, as a technodemiurge. The
romantic poet's reaction against the Industrial Revolution, creating a
subjective world, ideal, paradisiacal, resembles the one of the technopoet,
that, facing the technopoly is overpowering. It is a technocentric world
that offers him/her also a poetic language. The central question is to
subvert the technological language, transforming it into a technopoetical
language. This way, the culture doesn't surrender to the technology, but it
receives the poet's intervention, which turns the technology into another
form of poetic communication. These procedures become, then, a poeticizing
of computational technology."
Jorge Luiz Antonio

We might also say that the "poeticizing of computational technology" gets
some blood pumping through this technological extension of humanity, turning
it from a cold metal claw into something through which human fluids and
feeling flow.

 The section of the CD that features critical/theoretical texts contains
more than 100 texts that range internationally around the world from works
by Jean-Pierre Balpe (in French) to Friedrich Block (he's German but the
texts are in English) to Alejandro Banda (Chile), Augusto de Campos (in
Portuguese), Chris Funkhouser, Eduardo Kac, Ladislao Pablo (Argentina), and
many others.

The CD also contains a wealth of electronic poetry and texts about the art.
The poetry section contains work or works by over 200 artists. In a variety
of languages. From modernist poetry to contemporary computer poetry. With
emphasis on work from Brazil and South America. It's quite a remarkable
resource.

The CD also contains an 86-page chronology of digital poetry from 1959 to
the present complete with graphics and, in many cases, links.

There's also an extensive bibliography with links, on the CD.

I'm very impressed with what Jorge has accomplished. Of course, I wish I
understood Portuguese! But there is much English in the package-and much
digital poetry that can be understood independent of any particular
language.

Finally, I'd like to give you contact information so you can obtain a copy
of the book yourself. There are only somewhere between 250 and 500 copies of
it available, and you have to contact Jorge himself to get a copy, although
the book will be published in a bilingual edition, at some point, in the
USA.

Jorge's email address is jlantonio@uol.com.br . Jorge says "People can buy
the book on line by asking me. There are three ways to send money: PayPal
account, bank transference, and post office international payment order. The
other alternative is to offer an exchange of books and/or CD-ROMs."

You might also want to visit his blog at http://jlantonio.blog.uol.com.br .
He also maintains a list of links to Brazilian digital poetry at
http://vispo.com/misc/BrazilianDigitalPoetry.htm .

I'd like to see him sing Barthes while Van Halen back him on guitar. But Goldsmith must leave ample room for Van Halen to let loose with a solo.

For the first of the Fall 09 Small Press in the Archive lectures, please
join us this Tuesday, September 15th @3:30 p.m. for a talk by Elizabeth
Bonapfel:

"Form in Fragments:  Voice, Apostrophe, and Punctuation in James
Joyce's *Finnegans
Wake *Small Press Editions"

This talk will be held in The Poetry Collection, 420 Capen. This event is
free and open to the public.


********

Small Press in the Archive Lecture Series dedicates itself to the
study of poetry outside the traditional literary historical plot. The
lectures in this series draw on materials in The Poetry Collection, at
SUNY Buffalo in order to explore community/discourse formations, the
status of ephemera and the making of genre, the conditions of literary
production, transatlantic cross-pollinations in and between specific
magazines, the careers of poets, the role of book art, and how the
little magazine functions in the making of the avant-garde.

tom taylor has passed away after a long struggle with cancer. as a writer,
publisher, and photographer as a writer, a publisher, and photograper he
performed a vital part of the literary community. many of us are very sad

Dear Poeticists,

If you would like to write a review of one of these books please contact me
at p.brown62@gmail.com

cris cheek's 'part: short life housing'

Ed Roberson's The New Wing of the Labyrinth:
The New Wing of the Labyrinth (ISBN 978-0-935162-42-4, $15, 83 pp.) is
Ed Roberson's eighth full-length book of poetry. It is a taut,
intricately interwoven series of poems that presents an unsentimental
yet harrowing encounter with the finality of life: "where do we go /
but to die into immunity in this life / the thousand deaths that
evolve us." Roberson is a recent recipient of the Poetry Society of
America's Shelley Memorial Award.

Norman Fischer's Questions/Places/Voices/Seasons:
Norman Fischer's Questions/Places/Voices/Seasons (ISBN
978-0-935162-43-1, $16, 180 pp.) continues and expands the innovative
meditational poetry he has explored in earlier books, such as Slowly
but Dearly and I Was Blown Back. The two long serial poems that anchor
Questions/Places/Voices/Seasons, "Charlotte's Way" and "Seasons," will
feel quite familiar to Fischer's readers. But he also inaugurates a
new form of writing in this book in which he inhabits the voices of
others, such as Alberto Caeiro, Reb Yosl of Kemenetz, Elena Rivera,
and Saigyo Hoshi.

Thanks once again,
Pam Brown

Thumbing through recipes
I find a photograph of her
as a marionette
lounging among cushions
in a room filled
with parsed sentences.
I reach for my cutting board

downtown).

BYOB.  The conference is not associated with any university or
organization except for Series A (which is not really an organization
at all).  Feel free to come and throw your voice into the conversation

Subject:      post _ moot: call for proposals
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=ISO-8859-1

Call for creative proposals papers / performances / presentations (deadline
November 20th).


post _ moot: a 2nd convocation of unorthodox cultural and poetic practices


April 22-25, 2010, Miami University of Ohio


The second Post-Moot Convocation, an international conference to be held at
Miami in spring of 2010 to foster creative exchange among poets in the early
21st Century, will present papers / performances / presentations on a range
of contemporary issues in poetics.

Topics will likely include but will not be restricted to (we welcome other
formulations):

- ecopoetics
- issues of writing and power
- postconceptualist poetics
- performance and performance writing
- spatiality
- the book as object
- poetic economies
- sound / noise
- versions
- state of lyric
- signifying on older poetic traditions
- translation
- electronic archives

Proposals should take account of the fact that upwards of 50 people are
likely to be included in the program. In other words we can consider
presentations that have extended duration, but we hope not to get into
exhaustive parallel paneling and hope for proposals of between 15-25 mins on
average. We have a variety of presentation / performance venues available,
dependent upon proposals. We can host work by participants unable to attend
in person.

We look forwards to hearing from you: the post _ moot collective (Maria
Auxiliadora Alvarez, Tammy Brown, cris cheek, WIlliam R. Howe, Cathy Wagner)

please respond to: postmoot@gmail.com


ps

post _ moot 1 occurred in 2006, with generous participation from Michael
Basinski, Brian Brown, Peter Castaldo, Rachel Chase, cris cheek, Pete
Drummond, Steph Elstro, Alan Golding, K. Lorraine Graham, Kevin R. Hollo,
William R. Howe, jUStin katKO, Claire Keys, Steven Paul Lansky, Kirsten
Lavers, Mel Nichols, Tom Orange, Camille Paloque-Berges, Nicole Proctor,
Linda Russo, Rod Smith, Joshua Strauss, Rodrigo Toscano, Keith Tuma, Mark
Wallace, Leigh Waltz, Tyrone Williams, Aaron Yandrich.

post _ moot featured readings; screenings; book launches; a bookateria;

New McCarthyism: Fear of Science and the War on
Rationality

 	Parts of America are slipping back toward the
 	Dark Ages, when fear of knowledge and science
 	led to an impoverishment of civilization.

By Peter Gleick, Pacific Institute

Alternet.org - Posted on September 10, 2009

http://www.alternet.org/story/142520/

As more and more of the world looks to knowledge,
education and science as the routes out of poverty and
conflict, parts of America seems to be slipping back
toward the Dark Ages, when fear of knowledge and
science led to an impoverishment of civilization that
had lasting effects for centuries.

I've recently returned from two weeks in northern
Europe, and a series of scientific water meetings and
discussions with people from over 130 countries. They
read the news from the United States with incredulity.
America is still seen as the place to come for aspiring
students and scientists around the world. Our public
universities, despite assaults on budgets, independence
and knowledge, still struggle to maintain their
excellence. But my friends and colleagues from overseas
are increasingly shocked, as are many of us in the
U.S., by the expanding efforts of home-grown extremists
to undermine rational discourse, eliminate the use of
fact and science in policymaking, and shut down public
debate over the vital issues of our times through hate,
vitriol, and ad hominem attacks.

Looking through the eyes of my overseas colleagues,
what do we see?

We see a debate over providing health care to every
American that is based -- not on facts or civilized
discourse -- but on screaming mobs shutting down public
discussions and the use of straw man arguments to
promote fear among the public and policymakers. Yet
every major country of Europe provides basic health
care for its population.

We see President Obama appoint one of the nation's best
scientists in the areas of energy, environment, and
national security -- Dr. John Holdren -- to be his
Science Advisor, and then have right-wing mouthpieces
like Glenn Beck spread ad hominem lies about him
because of their fear that facts and actual science may
once again inform presidential action. This should be a
recognizable tactic to us -- lying about a person to
diminish their effectiveness. In fact, these extremists
want to undermine the forward-looking policies that
would prevent the very draconian measures they say they
deplore.

We see unambiguous evidence that climate change is
already affecting human health and the global economy
-- evidence often collected by world-leading American
scientists and scientific institutions -- while public
opinion polls show that the American people continue to
be misled about the risks facing us by conservative
pundits who ignore, misunderstand, or intentionally
misuse that science to mislead the public into fear of
change. Yet we already see huge economic and
environmental opportunities in adapting to the reality
of climate change.

Fear is an effective tool -- as hate groups and
extremists know. It is no accident that repressive
regimes of all kinds -- fascists, the Nazis, Stalin,
religious states, madrasses -- use tools of hatred,
anti-intellectualism, and fear to control knowledge,
universities, and intellectuals. Fear grows best when
sown in fields of ignorance, while science,
rationality, and education are the greatest weapons
modern societies have against irrational fear. No
wonder Beck and his ilk have intellectuals in their
sights; so do the leaders of Iran, and Burma, and the
Taliban, and North Korea, for similar reasons.

What does this have to do with water -- the ostensible
focus of my blog? Nothing and everything. I try to
focus on numbers here and what they mean for
international and local water issues. Yet water policy,
or any policy, must also be based on rationality,
facts, and civil discourse. Similarly, solving any bad
water contamination problem requires one of two
approaches: don't let the contamination into our water
supply in the first place, or apply the right filters
to clean it up when it does. The same rule applies to
those who would pollute our public discourse with hate
and noise: don't let their vitriol into our media
supply or filter it out before it can poison our
democracy.

Cultural Writing. Edited by Cara Benson, with contributors Paul Raskin, Bar=
t Bridger Woodstrup, Julie Sadler, David Zuga, Jason Zuga, and Monica de la=
 Torre. As is painfully obvious for many a religious leader and many a psyc=
hic, predicting the future is an indeterminate business. The work collected=
 in PREDICTIONS takes that indeterminancy as a starting point and celebrate=
s it. A futurist points to how the question of the future, once a matter fo=
r dreamers and philosophers, has moved to the center of development and sci=
entific agendas. Several artists, well aware that accelerating changes to t=
he environment require that we learn quickly, suggest how art might help us=
 to understand and to rethink the interface between old technologies and ne=
w technologies in this time of environmental crisis. A writer and a scienti=
st team up to tell an alternate story of evolution. And a poet writes, "Pre=
dictions acquire full meaning when they apply to the, until then,
 unimaginable." =0A=0A=A0=0A=A0Here's a link to its page at Small Press Dis=

when the means by which viewers navigate a web site are interesting, viewers
are more likely to navigate the site.

partly toward that end, and also to make the vispo.com home page simply more
attractive and informative about what is available on the site, i've written
some javascript for http://vispo.com that randomly selects one of over 200
graphics for the background of the homepage. i selected the 200+ images from
the thousands on vispo.com by eyeballing them to see if they worked as a
background on the homepage. most of the images were made with dbCinema; some
with The Pen. And whatnot.

the best way to view several of these images is to visit http://vispo.com
and either
1. click the colorful VIsPO logo repeatedly
2. click the little white triangle repeatedly
3. if you're on a PC, Ctrl+r reloads the page.

if you're on a PC, the F11 key toggles fullscreen viewing. fullscreen
viewing is recommended for vispo.com. this is not a blog.

Buffalo List,
Last night I had a chance to attend "Ah! Opera No-Opera" written by poet =
Martine Bellen and composer David Rosenboom performed at the Redcat =
Theatre in LA which will play Sept. 17-18. I highly recommend it.  =
Thrilling music, intense song and dance, and read-aloud materials with =
light projections and audience interactive to some extent--great.  Also =
interesting as an extension of this work are both the renewed interest =
in Buddhist sutras as scripts meant to be performed and experienced and =
the much-anticipated new translation of the Diamond sutra by a Stanford =
professor Paul Harrison due in 2010.  He reconsiders several things and =
translation choices reading the is/is not not so much as mystical =
negativity but a sort of nuanced definition to things as, he phrase it, =
fluid and more relational.

Poetry Season is upon us! Here=B9s the info on our first reading of the year,
Fall workshops, and a bus ride with our friends at The Foundry Theatre:

Wednesday, September 23, 8 PM

Prismatic Publics:=20
Nicole Brossard, Margaret Christakos & Catriona Strang

A reading to celebrate Prismatic Publics: Innovative Canadian Women=B9s Poetr=
y
and Poetics edited by Kate Eichhorn and Heather Milne, published by Coach
House. The anthology provides an opportunity to trace the diverse networks,
influences, dialogues, dialectics, and interventions that continue make the
work of Canada=B9s innovative women writers a powerful force in avant-garde
writing around the world.

Nicole Brossard has published more than thirty books, including Museum of
Bone and Water, The Aerial Letter and Mauve Desert. Her contribution and
influence to Quebec and francophone poetry is major. In 1965, she co-founde=
d
the literary periodical La barre du jour and, in 1976, the feminist journal
Les t=EAtes de pioche. In 2006, she won the Canada Council=B9s prestigious
Molson Prize for lifetime achievement. Her collection Notebook of Roses and
Civilization was shortlisted for the 2008 Griffin Poetry Prize. Her most
recent book is the novel Fences in Breathing. Brossard will be introduced b=
y
Susan Holbrook.=20

Margaret Christakos=B9 work has shown consistent interest in feminist and
recombinant poetics, process writing and seriality. She is the author of
seven books of poetry and a novel. A new collection, Purple, is forthcoming
in 2010. She runs =8CInfluency: A Toronto Poetry Salon=B9 twice annually,
through the University of Toronto=B9s School of Continuing Studies. Christako=
s
will be introduced by Rachel Zolf.

Catriona Strang=B9s latest book, co-written with the late Nancy Shaw, is=A0
Light Sweet Crude. Other works include Cold Trip and Busted, both co-writte=
n
with=A0 Nancy Shaw. She is a founding member of the Institute for Domestic
Research, and frequently collaborates with fellow institute member, compose=
r
Jacqueline Leggatt, and with clarinetist Fran=E7ois Houle, with whom she
recorded =8CThe Clamourous Alphabet=B9 (Periplum). She is currently working on
=8CExtrafine Imperial Twankay=B9, a long work based on the history of tea.
Strang will be introduced by Kate Eichhorn.

This event is co-presented with Coach House Books and D=E9l=E9gation g=E9n=E9rale d=
u
Qu=E9bec.


Building Architecture, Landscapes & Poems =AD Vito Acconci


Vito Acconci will be teaching a ten-week long Tuesday evening workshop,
beginning October 6, 2009. The class will meet in the Parish Hall from
7-9pm.

Poetry from another direction: poetry =8Ccaused by=B9 architecture & design=8A

Architectural materials & words as matter (=8Cconcrete=B9 words, not
abstractions =AD William Carlos Williams=B9 =8CNo idea but in things=B9); the
structure =AD the engineering =AD of a building & sentence-structure
(diagramming a sentence & plans/section in architecture); scripts (narrativ=
e
scripts, film scripts) & computer-scripting in architecture); punctuation =AD
like Emily Dickinson=B9s dashes =8B & the time taken to walk through a building=
,
through a city, through landscape); Roget=B9s Thesaurus as a geography, a
terrain, of words (the dictionary is from the mechanical age, while Roget=B9s
Thesaurus presages the internet)=8A

We might read Michel Butor=B9s Mobile (traveling through the United States in
words, cities & rivers & mountains scrawled across the page); but we=B9ll als=
o
see the beginning of Alain Robbe-Grillet/Alain Resnais=B9 Last Year At
Marienbad (the camera traversing corridor after corridor as the narrator=B9s
voice performs a travelogue & a hypnotism); & we=B9ll listen to Vladislav
Delay & Alva Noto (music & architecture are the same: each makes a
surrounding, a context, an ambience =AD you can do other things while
listening to music, you do other things while in the middle of architecture=
,
both architecture & music engender multi-attention, the keynote of the 21st
century)=8A

From a background of poetry & then art, Vito Acconci became a
designer/architect & formed Acconci Studio in 1988.=A0 They=B9ve recently built
a person-made island that twists from bowl to dome in Graz & a clothing
store as soft as clothing in Tokyo; they=B9re working on a strip-mall makeove=
r
in the U.S. & a floating park over a railroad in Vienna.=A0 He still begins
projects with words.


Poetry and Magic =AD Mitch Highfill

Mitch Highfill will be teaching a ten-week long Friday evening workshop,
beginning October 9, 2009. The class will meet in the Parish Hall from
7-9pm.

This workshop takes the work of Jack Spicer and =B3the practice of the
outside=B2 as a starting point. We will explore different technologies long
associated with magic (technologies such as spells, sigils and divination)
to generate writing, both in and out of the workshop setting. We will work
with sources as diverse as Gerard de Nerval, Christopher Dewdney and W.S.
Burroughs. A magical approach to poetics will include such concepts as the
Muse, the Duende and the lore accompanying these ideas. The goal here is to
gain access to writing that is not limited by the habits of personality or
the predilections of the poet, but can expand our ranges to include what
Robin Blaser called the outside. We might also consider the more mundane bu=
t
equally interesting usage of the word magic, that is to say, sleight of
hand, or prestidigitation. What does a stage magician have in common with
the writer? There will be lots of reading and writing in this workshop.

Mitch Highfill is a poet and Tarot consultant who lives in Brooklyn. He is
the author of several books, including Moth Light (Abraham Lincoln) and
REBIS (Open Mouth).


Drawing the Boundaries of a Fire =AD Paolo Javier

Paolo Javier will be teaching a ten-week long Saturday afternoon workshop,
beginning October 10, 2009. The class will meet in the Parish Hall from 12-=
2
pm.

Since the advent of the modern cartoon strip, poets, artists, and
poet-artists alike have turned to its language as a vital source for
innovation in their own practice. We will explore such a tradition.=A0The
presence of the poetic in the modern comic book will be a focus of our
writing and discussion, and we will experiment with its potential through a
diverse practice.=A0Collaboration between participants will be required for
selected exercises, and encouraged throughout the workshop.=A0

Paolo Javier is the author of LMFAO (OMG!), Goldfish Kisses (Sona Books), 6=
0
lv bo(e)mbs (O Books), and the time at the end of this writing (Ahadada
Books). He is currently working on OBB,=A0a multimedia poetry comic, with
artist Ernest Concepcion, and publishes 2nd Ave Poetry.


The workshop fee is $350, which includes a one year Sustaining Poetry
Project membership and tuition for any and all spring and fall classes.
Reservations are required due to limited class space, and payment must be
received in advance. Caps on class sizes, if in effect, will be determined
by workshop leaders. If you would like to reserve a spot in a class, please
send an email to info (at) poetryproject (dot) org or call 212-674-0910.

illiam Carlos Williams=C2=A0embarked upon a poem of place in which a city m=
ight be seen to mirror the forms of a man's mind, and the classic Paterson =
was born. In this course, we will consider techniques of documentary poetic=
s, the poetics of place, and eco-conversation. How can an artist, particula=
rly a writer, interact with particular loci and its data, real or imagined?=
 What forms of dialog with the environment are possible? What non-languaged=
 information can be included in the poem? We will look at and make our own =
work that interacts with the flora and fauna, layers of history, shifting p=
opulations, quotidian rhythms and mythologies of time-space. We might engag=

print edition of the journal will be available soon through Chax Press. For
ordering or subscription information, contact editor Tim Peterson at
EOAGH.Editor@gmail.com
*EOAGH: A Journal of the Arts* is concerned with reading as a process, the
productive chaos of investigative poetic work. These acts of attention
explore the close listening inherent not just in writing but also in being
written. Inspired by Whitman's assertion that "Reading is a gymnast's act,"
we see readings as embodied, interdisciplinary responses that engage with
one's environment through ekphrasis, phenomenology, queering, and the
pursuit of conceptual complexity/density. We seek poetry, prose, articles,
and readings that address these concerns in contemporary avant-garde,
experimental, and innovative writing.

"Each time we don't say what we wanna say we're dying!"
--Yoko Ono, from "YES, I'M A WITCH"

Belgrade Pride will march in the streets for queer pride and tolerance
this coming Sunday.  This, despite graffiti PROMISING violence against
the marchers.  The Serbian Orthodox Church claims that it does not
support the impending violence against the group, yet also has told
the news that the march is akin to "Sodom and Gomorrah."  Similarly,
president Boris Tadic REFUSES to endorse the march, claiming to uphold
Serbia's laws against discrimination.  The violence is clearly
sanctioned by both church and state indirectly, and if I had the money
I'd be over there right now to march with them!

In fact if I had the money I'd fly over there with me the remaining
members of the Philly Gay Mafia, the vicious, tough guys who used to
patrol and protect our streets in the Philadelphia queer community
back in the 1980s when violence against us was practically encouraged
by police.

My hope is that the marchers are as ready as they possibly can be for
what is about to happen to them.  My hope too is that the government
takes action to at the very least protect the marchers in their simple
act of walking together in the streets.  The violence to come has
literally been written on the walls of Belgrade.

In solidarity with Belgrade Pride,
CAConrad

I'm doing some winnowing here in NYC and have about two
boxes of old correspondence with various lit'ry lowlifes going
back to the early 70s.

Do they find a new home somewhere or do are they destined
for the fire?

Any suggestions appreciated--*backchannel only*, please.

Williamsburg, Brooklyn

JENNIFER KARMIN's text-sound epic Aaaaaaaaaaalice will be published by Flim=
 Forum Press in 2009. She curates the Red Rover Series and is a founding me=
mber of the public art group Anti Gravity Surprise. Her multidisciplinary p=
rojects have been presented at festivals, artist-run spaces, and on city st=
reets across the U.S. and Japan. At home in Chicago, she teaches creative w=
riting to immigrants at Truman College and works as a Poet in Residence for=
 the public schools. New poems are published in the journals Cannot Exist, =
Otoliths, Plath Profiles, and anthologized in Come Together: Imagine Peace =
(Bottom Dog Press), Not A Muse (Haven Books), and The City Visible: Chicago=
 Poetry for the New Century (Cracked Slab Books).

ESTELA LAMAT was born at the age of eight in the backyard of the house. She=
 has conducted meticulous nocturnal studies of sleeplessness, of stellar ch=
ances and causalities. Tamer of cats, enologist by nose, left-handed, and e=
pileptic, she has never been in a workshop; she has never entered any conte=
sts; nor has she won any literary awards.=20

MICHAEL LEONG's poetry career began in the sixth grade when he won his firs=
t and only poetry prize in Mr. Harrison=E2=80=99s class for a haiku about a=
 snake. Since then, he has received degrees in English and Creative Writing=
 from Dartmouth College, Sarah Lawrence College, and Rutgers University and=
 has published poems and translations in journals such as Action Yes, Bird =
Dog, Double Room, jubilat, Marginalia, Opium Magazine, Pindeldyboz, and Tin=
 House. He is the author of I, the Worst of All (blazeVOX [books], 2009), a=
 translation of the Chilean poet Estela Lamat, and e.s.p. (Silenced Press, =
2009). He currently lives in New York City.=20

_______________


On Tuesday, September 22, 2009, IMRAM, the annual Irish-language
literary festival, will present an evening of controversy & debate on
the issue of "Tradition and/or Innovation."

This debate will take place at 7:00 p.m. in the Irish Writers' Centre,
19 Parnell Square in Dublin, Ireland.  Admission is free.

PUBLIC LECTURE & DEBATE

Does the Irish language have a modern literary culture?  Or, have
universities limited literary discussion to folkloric texts that have
little to say to urban readers?  Can poetry & literature in Irish
survive if the rural Gaeltacht dies?  Can a modern literary culture
emerge from an urban creolized form of Irish?

Has the Irish-language become the prisoner of sociologists,
anthropologists, government bureaucrats & educators who have
constricted & suffocated the possibilities to such an extent that the
very survival of the language itself has been called into question?

Will literary innovation ever be tolerated in Ireland?

These are the questions that Tom=E1s Mac S=EDom=F3in raises in his IMRAM
talk, "An D=FAchas agus an Nua" (Tradition & Innovation).  D=E1ith=ED =D3
h=D3g=E1in, Professor of Folklore at University College Dublin, will reply
to the lecture, & IMRAM invites all with a serious interest in Irish
poetry & literature to join in this crucial debate.

Tuesday,
22 September 2009,
7:00 p.m.,
IRISH WRITERS' CENTRE,
19 Parnell Square,
Dublin, Ireland

Dear Amy

I almost never try to write a poem in such an instance. I just write
something else instead: a story, an essay, etc. If for some reason I feel
compelled to write a poem because of external pressure or internal angst, I
make use of some compositional procedure. So produce something aleatory or
conceptual or work with found text, something that takes the onus off of me
as a creator and shifts my focus onto working with language more as an
editor or sculptor.

Jonathan

I do several things.

Sometimes, I build collages of pics from Google Image searches put into
Microsoft Paint.

I also change my contextual perception. In other words, sometimes I feel too
pressured to "write a poem" and so I go to (either physically, mentally or
figuratively (using the internet)) a location that breaks my notions of what
a poem should be. The Internet is great for this. In the past I've used
Craigslist Missed Connections, comment boxes, forums, Netflix and Amazon
review-writing formats. I compose within these formats (providing an
"audience" of sorts), sometimes I post it, sometimes I don't. Sometimes this
causes Internet "weirdness" to happen:
http://blog.rifftrax.com/2008/08/07/helpful-product-reviews/

E.g., "Joke Invisible Dog Leash"

I'm giving this toy's educational value five stars. I've learned more in
Georgia. Sometimes value is reflected in how we learn not to act. The dog
died because I let her run free. There was no escape, and no run. No run
that we were captives to an action. A service entrance left the dog loose.
The dog's being loose -- lack of smell - meant I was unable to give it meat.
Nutrition was usually left outside the service entrance. The dog went
through the entry, changing its name. A truck then came at very fast paces.
I wanted to run and tell my momma on ya'll. I broke. Time till entry? She
was a yelper. I was given a few seconds with the pile. Puddled, our
interaction lacked a fluid. I soon pupped and found pain was involved. My
fault, crazy at the end and leashed - air being left in a flat to sour - lay
down to perform the angel in creamed corn I would not be hungry enough to
eat.

I haven't had that problem for years but I would say reading would be =
the
key. I often begin the morning reading and later find myself writing and
wondering "When did that reading turn into this writing?" briefly before =
I
turn back to I consider a word or a line.

Revising also pours me back in.

Regarding the upcoming poetry conference:

*Advancing Feminist Poetics and Activism: A Gathering*

Thursday September 24th, 2009 - Friday September 25th, 2009*
City University of New York Graduate Center
New York, New York

For the complete schedule, try this link below:

http://belladonnaseries.org/adfemposchedule.html

*Each panel on women's poetics -- running concurrently -- looks
fascinating.  It will be hard to choose which one.
Of course I want to plug my own (below, from the program):

Room 4 [Panel 16]:*
*Visuality and the Image:
A Reading and Discussion with Ann Lauterbach, Mei-mei Berssenbrugge and
Laura Hinton *
*Chair:* Laura Hinton
*Panelists: *Mei-mei Berssenbrugge, Ann Lauterbach
*Description*: This session takes the form of readings by and conversation
with Mei-mei Berssenbrugge, Ann Lauterbach, and Laura Hinton. Framed as a
performative inquiry into women=92s particular use of the image, both in
feminist and activist contexts, we'll consider the stakes in image-making
for a gender that Mary Ann Doane has suggested bears a socialized =93close
proximity=94 to the image itself.

There will be a poetry-film / "slide show" as part of this panel, to includ=
e
the verbal-visual collaboration issues addressed recently by this Poetics
List. Hope to see some of you there.

Stand on your head for ten minutes.  Back bends are also useful - they
cleanse the nerves.  Perhaps a lack of inspiration is caused by the toxins
that build up in our body from living in the modern world.  Make yourself
sweat, then scrub off the dead skin before the toxins are reabsorbed.  And
make sure to rehydrate.  Lack of inspiration could also be caused by
dehydration.  Tapas - the fire of effort, to burn through the lack of
clarity, the impurity, the processed sugar.  Then there's also mula-bandha.

I remind myself that there is no real need for me to write poems, except =
that my happiness depends on it.
Otherwise there are plenty of great poems already.  And plenty of people =
busy writing more.  This attitude doesn't really help of course.  But =
poetry can be seasonal.  Sometimes the thing that most interests is =
something else.

I haven't had that problem for years but I would say reading would be the
key. I often begin the morning reading and later find myself writing and
wondering "When did that reading turn into this writing?" briefly before I
turn back to I consider a word or a line.

Revising also pours me back in.

Want to write a poem but the pen's not moving?  How do you get going =
again?
 Rituals? Return to a certain poet?  Take a walk?  Look up poetry =
exercises?
 Open the Spanish wine?
Just wondering!

Sentimental? Who would?
Creeley, when he first mentioned his practice, said that he favoured
Ch. Parker.

Petty crime, perhaps shoplifting. Changing the order of everyday
things--if you put on your undies first try instead a sock, then
shirt, etc. Flagellation. Extreme religious hysteria. Drugs. A car
crash. A life-threatening illness.The illness or death of the
beloved. Join the foreign legion. Eat something really awful.

Or decide there are too many poems in the world already and only
write when you really need to. As far as I know there's no assigned quota.

yes creeley told me he learned to write--of course this is a partial
statement--from listening to charlie parker at the hi-hat on boylston st in

I usually have a long-term project in mind for such eventualities.
Currently, for instance, there's my tarot project, so if I haven't written
my daily poem and the evening's drawing on, I pick a card. I also find that
if I'm stuck after a line or a few words, using traditional form can be  a
help, even though I usually revise such pieces against the rules.

Unlike some others here, I've never found music to be of help--while writing
prose yes, but for poetry I find it tends to suffocate the subtle rhythms.

Now, when the difficult days start to outnumber the ones with flow, I know
it's time to move.

i think them the juices
and the flowing again the poems

no need to take up anybody else's time. no paper and ink wasted. no
further storage requirements. i can think the entirety of the work,
its means of production and circulation. i can think the promotional
tour, the mixed reviews, the feeling of falling on deaf ears (i've
always found that turn of phrase hilarious), the abjection and
humiliation of obscurity, the thought of being rediscovered on a
distant planet at some undesignated time in the future . . .

You could write a poem about the difficulty of writing poems when
you're not inspired to write. It certainly would engage.

Well, the normal route is to pick up a collection by a favorite poet and feed on the poems, but I prefer the undesirable: feeding on the work of a poet you hate most!

Want to write a poem but the pen's not moving?  How do you get going again?  Rituals? Return to a certain poet?  Take a walk?  Look up poetry exercises?  Open the Spanish wine?
Just wondering!

I look at some of my previous work, especially unfinished poems, and =
that stimulates my interest and energy level.  Sometimes I grab one of =
my journals, any of them -- just grab one -- and pop it open wherever.  =
I usually find within a page or two something to use as a springboard =
for a new poem.  I do the same thing with music (I am a songwriter).  =
I'll pick up the guitar and play and sing a few old songs of mine, or =
cover songs, then before I know it, I'm starting to play around with new =
ideas.=20

Attempt to halt the flow of time without the use of hallucinogens, then
examine and analyse your emotional responses when you realise that your
efforts are futile - also you'll realise, concurrently that it is far easier
to write a poem!

it's a really old vaudeville line--who knows who originated it, as it is
"lost inthe sands of time"--
a lot of the great comics of the early 20th century had gotten their starts
with traveling burlesque shows, vaudeville acts, making the circuit of the
"Borscht Belt" and so forth--

most of the lines the Marx brothers used were a combination of things they
had perfected through years of work on stage as well as an amalgam of
various other people's jokes and routines, as one comedian would take a bit
from one comedian here, another there, and mix them al together into
something new in arrangement

60 to 85%  (if not more) of woody allen's work is all recycled "Borscht
Belt" routines and one liners, Yiddish jokes, things from the radio etc

w c field,s charlie chaplin cary  grant (a terrific physical comedian out of
English vaudeville) buster keaton--the list goes on and on of the old time
vaudevillians who became famous first on stage and then in the cinema--

i think the way  overblown appreciate of woody allen does a great disservice
to the tradition he comes out of--which is very old, going back to traveling
entertainers in russia, germany, poland--created in many coutnries by
generations of professional trsaveling comics who could also do -hysical
comedy to accompany  the verbal barbs--and gymnastics--Fields for example
was the great billiards and balncing act of his time, considered the best in
the world, and traveled as far away as Australia as well as across Europe--
so as to travel across language barriers (including those between differing
groups of immigrants in the usa) physical acts and comedy were a necessity
in a way not understood nor practised that much anymore--(outside of grafix
and comix)

the marx brothers themselves were from austria

a common form of humor in the usa since the early 19th century had been the
mix-ups caused by the immigrant or the not very educated persons attempts to
describe something to a regular speaker of american--with incredibly screwy
results--

(i think i wrote here  the tradition of mark twain and artemus ward in which
not only pronunciation of words but their appearance on pages naps catlogues
etc--is distorted into completely new and wild beings, events,
personages--by a form of homophonic reading whch translates misread
wordsinto homphonic misreadings creating ever more confusion and distance
fro the original as it goes along, passed from one person to the next--
one of the problems being that until later in the 19th century there was no
standard spelling for much of the american language--
even a lot of abe lincoln's celebrated humor is often based on these imense
gaps between the written and spoken which result in wide gaffes--


t.s. eliot was a huge fan of English vaudeville and music hall and wrote an
essay on it--

if you look at a lot of the history of French painting and poetry and prose
as well between roughly 18815 and the first world war, it is hugely indebted
to the dance hall, the cafe with perfrormances,  circus, to vaudeville, to
the bicycle racers on the huge tracks in the city where one could lean up
against th the barrier and feeling the sucking in of the air as the racers
passed by

woody allen came along at a time when alot of second and third generation
americans had stopped bothering with the entertainment their elders, which
stank of the booze and saw dust days, the old school comedians alternating
one liners with a physical comedy act or balancing twenty million dishes on
the head of a screwdriver and then doing something else with the screwdriver
when the dishes fell--or juggling, which was w c fileds' main forte--the
world's ,ost juggler--who added spoken assaults on logic, reality so-called,
the Law-- to his crazed balancing and juggling acts--

woody allen was the person who performed the old school acts slightly or
vastly  watered down and less crude for the younger generation too
embarrassed to go to the shows with mom and dad--in short he made a style of
comedy acceptable to college students and dates wh o otherwise would not
have touched it with a ten foot pole--

a friend of mine and his father took me to some of the old Borscht Belt
shows in NY State and they were great! --the real origins of so many acts
were there--

Groucho's line could have come from any kind of immigrant comedian--Italian
German
Russian, Polish, Czech, Spanish--al of whom would not be welcome at many a
club just as these comedians would nopt be welcome today at the clubs woody
allen played

which
one is measured, the eyechart becomes instead a horizon of possibility!

Interaction (the only word for it!) with these pieces gives one much to thi=
nk
about, and a timely, wry twist to all the anxiety that seems to be in the a=
ir
these days about a "public" health option...

Geof=E2=80=99s essay on this work appears in vol. 6, along with a stellar a=
rray of
=E2=80=98fidgetglyphs=E2=80=99.

*
60 pps, perfectbound in letterpress wrappers; $10

Part landscape poem, part action painting, part astral projection--in this
collaborative piece between artist and poet, the agent of enunciation speak=
s
herself into a near crystalline silence: =E2=80=9Cdearest i am writing this=
 to you from
above"...

New blog post:

'Another Day for Kent Johnson'
=20
A new book by Kent Johnson is now available. It's called Day and is publish=
ed by Blazevox. It has had some good reviews, including the following by Ju=
liana Spahr:
'If the 836-pp. Day established Kenny Goldsmith as without a doubt the lead=
ing conceptual poet of his time, the 836-pp. Day by Kent Johnson may well b=
e remembered for nudging the politics of Conceptual Poetry out of blithely =
affirmative, institutional framings, and into truly negational critical spa=
ces'.
Commendation indeed, if not for the fact that Johnson=E2=80=99s Day is an e=
xact reproduction of Goldsmith=E2=80=99s =E2=80=9Cwork=E2=80=9D. I=E2=80=99=
ve put =E2=80=9Cwork=E2=80=9D in quotes because Goldsmith would readily agr=
ee that the work in question was not =E2=80=9Ccreated=E2=80=9D by him in an=
y authorial sense. He describes his working procedure for the book ........=

author writing, 20 years later, on a Mediterranean island.

Jean Daive=92s impressive oeuvre alternates between poetry, narration =20=

Dear Chicago, Dear Everyone...

Has everyone had a look at this latest article by Kent Johnson about
The New Chicago School of Poetry?  Here's the link:
http://www.digitalemunction.com/2009/09/08/guest-post-the-new-chicago-school-of-poetry-by-kent-johnson/

I have respect for his work and opinions, and even his enthusiasms
displayed in this article.  What I wonder though is HOW do the Chicago
poets feel about what he wrote?  In particular to the WAY he frames
his praise by knocking other poetry communities in the country?

THIS was something I had hoped to read in the COMMENTS box, but of
course, as you will see, that became one big weird argument about
WHICH non-Chicago poet called it first!  It's really silly, but worth
a laugh or two to say the least!

There are some very big statements and judgements made, and I'm
wondering how everyone feels, especially the Chicago poets.

interestingly, the "set pieces" and other physical comedy -- as well as cgi
and animation -- are what make films get better international grosses now:
 no dubbing necessary for those bits
probably also a huge factor in Jackie Chan -- that Peking Opera training
meeting the physical comedy of the silents --

but wikiquote said John Galsworthy?

This evening will feature three different artists/groups, which use the
online virtual world of Second Life as a medium for performance art.
Launched in 2003 by Linden Labs, Second Life (SL) hit widespread
popularity in 2006. In this 3D-rendered world, people across the world
share a networked space with unique avatars. With a completely
user-generated environment, SL enables a rich world of artistic
possibilities.

Alan Sondheim along with Foofwa d'Imobilite will present a performance
using the aesthetics of the Second Life environment to create an
experimental choreography; Lily & Honglei will present The Merry-go-around
a virtual installation addressing a series of environmental issues in
todays China; Second Front has discovered a virtual crypt within Second
Life and are inviting the public to witness its opening. Together, these
three short performances (12-15 minutes each) will sample some of the
contemporary trends in Second Life performance art.
The performances will be followed by a brief panel discussion and a
subsequent launch party of Avvie Road  the second DVD of Second Fronts
performance works.

People: Alan Sondheim (with Foofwa d'Imobilite), Lily & Honglei, Patrick

"Seducing Velasquez is a collection of nervy, impish, unconventional
dramatic works that draw their strength from Stetco's rigorous
investigations into the connection between verbal, visual, and physical
languages and from the innovative performance traditions associated with
the author's native Romania.  These plays are witty and marvelous, in
the mode of the best absurdist art, and are welcome interventions into
the American theater scene."

I presume the "blurbs" in support of Johnson's book are also appropriated or
fabricated. This is a clever joke, but I don't see how it is conceptually
interesting. Unlike Goldsmith's DAY, which recontextualized text in an
"uncreative" gesture (a Duchampian raising of "journalistic" prose into the
realm of poetry), and thus produced a rich text, replete with previously
dormant meaning, Johnson's DAY does little more than repeat the gesture, and
thus the only significance it seems to hold is to question the validity of
assigning such a work to any single, particular author, something already
implicit in Goldsmith's project and only superficially interesting in the
first place.

with Frank Sherlock at THE EcoNvergence CONFERENCE, hope to see you
there:  http://www.econvergence.org/

There's also a poetry reading after Chomsky that we're all taking part
in.  Is Chomsky married?  He's the kind of older man I've been
dreaming of, you know????  YEAH!  Just let him talk and talk and talk,
LOVE to hear that man talk about the destruction of our world and how
we're going to find our way back to wholeness

Ouch! Number 9 sounds like a compulsive disorder, something close to one of
the chapters in the film, "Criminal Minds." Anyway, set things on fire, but
think FBI.

Dear Everyone,

PS This weekend, while in NY for the advancing feminist poetries and
politics conf, which gave me enough fuel for my hungry brain for ages -- &
afterwards made me aware thru emails of various political sub-groups within
it, I got CA Conrad's Elvis book, and couldn't stop reading it. CA you are a
scene unto yourself.

Boston feels like an English village in comparison to NY, & it seems to be
that many of the innovative reading series take place in NY or Calif tho of
course other places like Providence & here to a much smaller degree.

Met Jennifer Karmin at the conf--she is from Chicago & she graciously
invited me to read in the Red Rover series some time next year--she talked
about how as much as she found the conf exciting she felt it wasn't
particularly inclusive. Is Chicago exclusive? Dunno.

Here in Boston the innovative scene is mostly younger guys, which is
inevitable maybe, with a few oldsters like Joel Sloman & me who are on the
fringes.

At the conf I heard/met Vanessa Place, Chris Tysh, who's in Detroit, Jeanne
Heuving, who teaches at the U of Washington in Seattle, Mei Mei B, Kathleen
Fraser (Calif & Rome), Eileen Myles--where is she?--zippy women,
individuated women who are doing new things, dispersed--this is part of the
new community. And a new worldwide movement for human rights for women.

Conceptual poetry seems to be another newest thing, and tho I am not
inclined to practice it myself, the theory is edgy & exciting. And Canadian
women poets from Coach House Press gave a reading at the Bowery Poetry Club.

Tony Trigilio & I once taught at Northeastern U in Boston together & he is a
sweetie.

But maybe the online community is as close as we get.

But I think any generalities incl ones I have just made are suspect.

Ruth

Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"; format=flowed

In this month's essay, Writing from the (Proletariat) Bones, we move
away from the subject of poetry and delve into fiction, specifically
a polemic about the short stories being published in Canadian
periodicals these days. Do they represent the experience of Canadians
today, people coping with layoffs, sickness, domestic violence, drug
addiction, teens and aging parents?

Former Ottawa writer, now disgruntled Victoria, BC resident, Jeff Fry
questions the lack of representation for the underprivileged in
contemporary Canadian fiction citing prize winning stories from
current issues of the literary periodicals Grain and Prism Magazine
as prime culprits. Fry links privilege to a lack of experience with
failure and struggle for the writer. He suggests that this lack of
experience with failure can lead to a lack of imagination and
creativity in the text.

How have I never stumbled across Larry Levis until my 38th year? =A0Is it b=
ecause he didn't belong to any particular "school"? =A0Maybe I've just been=
 living in the New York box....?
The poems I've been reading in his posthumous book, edited by his friend an=
d former teacher, Philip Levine, ELEGY, are worth diving into. =A0Just orde=
red WINTER STARS, supposed to be a step up from Elegy. =A0Take a look at "A=
nastasia and Sandman" (tho the stanza breaks are off, I believe) from Elegy=

"superficially interesting" is very precise.

Subject:      An urgent note from Roland Prevost: save jwcurry & Room 302 Books!

john curry, certainly a world class poet living in our community, is
presently facing almost certain eviction.

Stephen Brockwell alerted me of this precarious situation, by phone, and
asked if I would get the word out, most recently at the TREE Reading
Series on September 22, where we were able to scare up enough to cover one
of his 5 months owed rent & save his telephone service.

currys been in constant production of his own and hundreds of others work
since 1979. hes mainly ineligible for grants. His bookstore is mainly an
unused resource. His archive documenting the growth of avant-garde writing
in Canada is one of the key collections in the country. Nicky Drumbolis
has said: curry and his work are the best-kept secret in Canada.

Since time is of the essence, if currys to avoid eviction, there are a few
ways you can help:

	Start to use his goddamn store!

	Room 302 Books is the only bookstore in Canada ever to focus
specifically on the avant-garde and overlooked outsiders, specializing in
concrete/visual/sound poetries (mainly Canadian) with a stock of over
20,000 mainly rare titles, including elusive ephemera, and probably the
only source of most of jwcurrys various imprints and titles (which number
in the thousands). currys current lists finally focus on his own work as
artist & publisher, virtually the first time everything thats (still)
available has been made commonly available. You can purchase bookstore
IOUs (or set up an account) today in any amount for those whod like to do
that.

	Subscribe to Curvd H&z, currys serial imprint. donor subscriptions
(please indicate) of $100 or more get « the stash in a sampling of available
titles from various of his imprints immediately, the remaining « put on
account for forthcoming titles.

	Donate outright.

I would like to encourage you to donate something so as to keep this
excellent bookstore, publisher, archive and artist alive, and at the same
time help prevent currys eviction from his apartment. For those whod like
to purchase bookstore IOUs, Id ask you to write (#302-880 Somerset Street
West, Ottawa Canada K1R 6R7) or call him at (613) 233 0417. Please
contribute as you can.

Roland Prevost (with collusions with curry)

1 - The conceptually interesting point might be that although the germ wa=
s
implicit, it was followed to its logical, appropriative conclusion. Doing=
 so
with this particular work seems apt.

2 - Have you read both?

3 - I prefer Kent's.

4 - I haven't read it.

5 - So....at least one or two "enlightened" poets are discussing two "boo=
ks"
neither has intentions of ever completely reading? Quite a startling
thought! How can we discuss if we don't?=20

6 - What would it even mean to read both?=20

Thanks for the opportunity to jump into the list!

It's interesting, Jonathan, that you'd defend Goldsmith's DAY (and
dismiss Johnson's DAY) in the name of originality ("produced a rich
text, replete with previously dormant meaning"), when this is the
regime of value that Goldsmith explicitly and repeatedly rejects. (See
Goldsmith, internet, passim.) I presume that you, like many other
people, accept that rejection as a pose, a mere mockery of public
modesty, even though Goldsmith, apparently, does not see it that way.
("In fact, every time I have to proofread [my books] before sending
them off to the publisher, I fall asleep repeatedly. You really don't
need to read my books to get the idea of what they're like; you just
need to know the general concept.")

Or maybe you take Goldsmith's word for it that "In conceptual writing
the idea or concept is the most important aspect of the work. When an
author uses a conceptual form of writing, it means that all of the
planning and decisions are made beforehand and the execution is a
perfunctory affair." If that's the case, then tell me, please, what
makes Goldsmith's idea interesting? Given that the same idea has been
had, and executed, by thousands of others, including Richard Prince,
Sherri Levine, and anyone who's "written" a found poem, why should we
see Goldsmith's project as any more or any less interesting than
Johnson's?

But here's a thought: what if the dismissal of Kent's DAY as
"superficially interesting" was exactly the point of his project? I
don't say that it is; Kent can speak to that (or could, if he weren't
banned from this list, though I'm sure he'll find a way to participate
somehow). But what if? What if one took the annoyed response to
Johnson's DAY as exactly the reaction he wanted, since it proved the
fact--which you may take to be obvious, but which no one seems willing
to publicly acknowledge--that there is a bright line between the kind
of people whose uncreative writing allows them to reap every reward
the culture industry has to offer=97publication, glossy magazine
interviews, fellowships and tenured academic positions--and those
whose *identical* uncreative writing gets them shunned as wannabes?
And what if that bright line has nothing to do with the work, or the
ideas behind the work, and everything to do with the fact that one has
gone to the right schools, lived in the right cities, and licked the
right boots? I think you'd have to admit that it's a superficially
interesting thought, at the very least.

I got a massive charge of energy when I first read about this guy in New =
York City re-typing the New York Times.  I think I read it in the New York =
Times actually! Could it be?  I've met Kenny Goldsmith since then but I =
still see that first Kenneth of my imagination (a bald guy, a little like =
Stanely Tucci) in his apartment stacked with New York Timeses. =20

The charge was in the concept.  You can read the book or not (I haven't).  =
You can order it for the library (I have).  There's quite a heft to it.  =
Often there's a sweet tension between the conceptual and the material in =
Kenny's work.  Writer of wooden books.  Sculptor of provocation.  He's an =
artist.

Kent's gesture has the status of a joke for me.  It's a bit funny.  And, =
materially, I like the idea of Geoffrey Gatza getting deliveries from =
Amazon, sticking on stickers, filling orders for $250 .... well, maybe =
not.   Perhaps there isn't a performance dimension.

Bobby Baird's original (!) 6/3/08 comment to Harriet fits its skin better:

"And so here=E2=80=99s my question: who gets to be an uncreative genius? =
And more importantly: on what grounds? If I recreate Day=E2=80=93an =
achievement, one must admit, that would be even more uncreative than the =
=E2=80=9Coriginal=E2=80=9D=E2=80=93am I a genius? Will The Figures publish =
it under my name? Will Publisher=E2=80=99s Weekly review it? Will I be =
invited to speak at the next Conceptual Poetics conference on the basis of =
it?"
http://www.poetryfoundation.org/harriet/2008/05/marjorie-perloffs-unorigina=
l-genius/

He answers the question in his next paragraph, which is a bit dreary.  At =
least Kent's gesture locates itself in the paragraph with most energy.
