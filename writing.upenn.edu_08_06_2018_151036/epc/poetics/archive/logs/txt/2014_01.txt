MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=windows-1252
Content-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable

On this first day of the year 2014, one countdown ends and another begins.
This new countdown has nothing to do with the gradual fading of 2013 and
the celebratory lauding of 2014, but instead ushers in a new social
project: on the 4th of January, *Wish4[0] *begins.

As extensive use of mobile devices such as smart phones, wearables and
tablets has become the norm, it=92s apparent how networked/online
communication has become a crucial component of our everyday news and
entertainment cycles, as well as a critical social tool. In the resultant
infoglut we=92ve willingly created [and to which we seem quite content to
constantly expose ourselves], privacy concerns are prompting pushbacks
against oversharing and the incessant rush of accelerating digital news.
And yet, deliberate poetic responses to such critical social issues seem
constantly overlooked and underutilised=85

=85which is where* Wish4[0]* comes in. Once a day, for 40 days, a digital
literature work will be posted to
wishforyouand.me<http://wishforyouand.me/about/>.
Each work will take as its immediate inspiration a headline, or item, drawn
from the electronic news cycle of that specific day...

DevilHouse is an imprint of AngelHousePress with a goal to explore &
investigate the transgressive in creative work. http://devilhousepress.com/

Note that the site includes a call for submission for transgressive
literature & a series of interviews with transgressive writers &
publishers, Sean Moreland, M. Christian, Kathlean Bradean & Mark
McCawley. I'd love to have more participants in the interviews by
artists, poets, novelists, short story writers, musicians, playwrights,
film makers etc...

=93S=E9amas Cain described his play about the =91Conamara=92

him joined in this by Bridget Connelly of UC Berkeley,

who found out late in life that she too came from this

background.  An excerpt from Cain's Gaelic play was

performed.  The =91Language, literature and society=92

theme was introduced with another contribution from

Cain, featured here, on innovative Irish writers,

both autochthonous and diasporic, surely part

of the healing of our country.=94

Dear Drunken Boat Friends,

Drunken Boat, international online journal of the arts, is pleased to announce the release of DB#18! DB#18 features special folios on Debt, our pervasive economic and psychological condition; the Ocean, which delves into the depths of nautical and marine life that surrounds us; the Librotraficante movement to smuggle banned books back into Arizona and Texas to counter the hostile anti-immigration legislation enacted there; and video_dumbo, the annual festival of international contemporary video art that has emerged over the last decade as a crucial exhibition platform for emerging filmmaker and media artists.

Additionally, we are pleased to showcase our regular features on Fiction, Poetry, and Reviews.

Please join us at AWP in Seattle to celebrate the launch of DB#18, and welcome our new Managing Editor, Erica Mena. We will be co-hosting a performance with Ugly Duckling Presse, Ahsahta and Les Figues Press on Friday, February 28th, @ 7pm at the Alibi Room (85 Pike Street, #410, Post Alley) in Seattle, WA.

And keep an eye on our blog to find out more about what we are planning for 2014, our 15th year in existence!

Drunken Boat is a non-profit organization and magazine/book publisher that depends on reader support for its existence. Drunken Boat Issue #18 is now live at drunkenboat.com/db18 - enjoy!

This is a poetry equally committed to language as a tool with social
obligations and language as an art material obligated to reveal its own
beauty. King=92s language does both magnificently.

Hi friends,

Facing Pages, the biennial festival of independent print magazines,
perhaps Europe's largest, is coming up again this March, and they are
currently looking for magazines to include in their big exhibition. If
you'd like to be included, all you have to do (it seems) is send 2
copies of your mag and contact info@facingpages.orgto let them know it's
coming.

To find out more and to see if it's a good fit for you, their website is
here: http://www.facingpages.org

I'm not associated with the organization so please direct any questions
to Facing Pages themselves.

Happy new year! I hope to see many of you in Seattle soon!

Megan

I'd like to make members of this list aware of the "Engaged Humanities
and the Creative Life" MA program at Pacifica Graduate Institute. It is
a hybrid on-line/low residency program, although students look forward
to the 4-day residentials because of the beauty of the campus, which is
in the hills a few miles south of Santa Barbara, CA.:
http://www.pacifica.edu/

Such distinguished scholars as mythologist Joseph Campbell, psychologist
James Hillman, Religious Studies professor David L. Miller, and
philosopher Edward S. Casey have taught there. The present Chair is
literary critic, Susan Rowland: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MXHCIYefgsc

The Engaged Humanities program values both scholarship and creativity,
with an emphasis on Depth (Jungian) Psychology:

Public Dialog from the Cybermind Conference, 1996

Please go to http://www.alansondheim.org/cyberconf.txt

This is early on, and deals with text-based vituality,
cyber-sex, community, and other related issues.
Thought it would be of interest again, even with all
its faults. The conference was held in Perth. We used
a MOO, newsgroup, CuSee-Me, and other online means to
communicate to the world at large.

P'layout Intrusions. By Rosaire Appel
p'layout =3D page layout.

I noticed finally that I've been noticing page layouts for while, a long
while even, perhaps since childhood. I remember how pictures and words were
dispersed in those first books. Maybe everyone does. The subject is: the
arrangement of information on a flat surface =97 not in terms of good and b=
ad
design =97 but as a language in its own right. It's a language that has a l=
ot
of formality, like architecture. Books, newspapers, magazines of course =97
contemporary and historic =97 and also ancient writing on papyrus, on stone=
,
on clay=85.

No doubt my (abstract) comics are inspired by this also. I'm not
researching however, I'm not even thinking about it: I'm just noticing it
in the world =97 and exploring it on the page. The foundations of these
compositions were blocks of newspaper text to which I added shards from my
own commercially-printed book proofs. They're collages of layouts =97 with
additions and subtractions =97 suggestive, allusive.

features the flotsam and jetsam of partially hidden dialogue; language as
an exploded view--as a blur doused in ink. Here, the possibilities of space
and displacement form in a marriage of images and text that boast this
inaccessible, yet very accessible decomposition-- laying out form and
anti-form, while suggesting the possibilities of the impossible.
=97Matina Stamatakis

The pages of P'Layout Intrusions by Rosaire Appel unfold like a graphic
novel, a near wordless journey through text turned geography. Organic
shapes and columnar panels invite us to narrate for ourselves the action of
Appel's thoughtful collage sequence.
=97Robin F. Brox

Rosaire Appel's Intrusions Playout is one book of visual poetry that will
register on seismographs all over the world. Each page is in the midst of
topsy-turvy seismic activity: fault-blocks of text upturning, image-magma
under immense pressure erupting into space, molten lava bursting into
flame. Bring a hard hat readers!

century art, typography, computer graphics, visual & concrete poetry
movements & the art of the copier have been combined. Each issue is

Dear Professor Hinton,

I am currently at work on a book chapter on the work of Jayne Cortez. The bo=
ok as a whole treats the relationship between innovative writing and music; t=
he Cortez chapter is the last in the book. The chapter title is, "Eurydice T=
akes the Mic," and it frames Cortez's practice in relation to the Orphic tra=
dition linking poetry and music. I would very much appreciate the opportunit=
y to air this argument at the ALA. Please let me know if you would be willin=
g to consider a fully formed abstract.

Thank you, and all best.

I honor the translation that resists normalization-that way lies dead and
charred surfaces. These paragraphs began with an off-handed promise to read
a friend's translations of selected poems by Paul Celan and that promise has
led me to a careful reading of Derrida's Sovereignties, especially
"Shibboleth." Comments on Pierre Joris' The Meridian: Paul Celan and Susan
H. Gillespie's Corona: Selected Poems of Paul Celan are embedded in this
post.

Founded to celebrate the 150th anniversary of the City of Ottawa, Canada's
glorious capital city, "ottawater," and its chemical formula/logo
"O2(H2O)," is a poetry annual produced exclusively on-line, in both
readable and printable pdf formats, and found at
(http://www.ottawater.com). An anthology focusing on Ottawa poets and
poetics, its first issue appeared in January 2005, 150 years after old
Bytown became the City of Ottawa.

Long seen only as a town still echoing its origins as a backwater
Victorian lumber town, and made up of bureaucrats and technocrats, and a
more conservative poetics, "ottawater," edited by Ottawa-born writer,
editor and publisher rob mclennan, exists to remind readers of what work
is happening, and has been happening for years, despite government types
insisting on repeating that the arts in Ottawa is about to begin. We say
instead: we have always been here.

Subject:      Robert Zend: Poet without Borders
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=ISO-8859-1

As some of you are aware, during the past few months I've been writing  an
illustrated exploration of the life and work of Robert Zend (1929-1985),
avant-garde Hungarian-Canadian poet and artist. It features photographs,
poetry, concrete poetry, collages, typewriter art, and fiction, some of it
never before made public. Special attention is given to Zend's cosmopolitan
literary spirit, including his international influences and affinities.
I'll be posting installments twice a week on my blog, Rogue Embryo.


This has been a joyful and fascinating project, made possible by the kind
assistance of many people, including members of the Zend family (Janine
Zend, Natalie Zend, and Ibi Gabori) and the curators of the Zend fonds at
the University of Toronto Library, Media Commons (Rachel Beattie and Brock
Silversides), among others.


Here is the address for the first installment, "Preface with Portraits":


http://rogueembryo.com/2013/12/04/robert-zend-1929-1985-poet-without-borders-preface-with-portraits/


If you'd like to receive notices of further installments, please feel free
to subscribe to Rogue Embryo. Kindly spread the word to any who may be
interested in this topic. Your feedback and comments are most welcome.


Warm wishes,

Camlle Martin

I started the Poetics List in late 1993, just after I came to Buffalo and
co-founded the Poetics Program and a little while before the founding of the
Electronic Poetry Center. At that time the this list was a radically new
format. But it has been over ten years since I left Buffalo; it is not longer
viable for me to continue to sponsor the list.

I want to thanks the list moderators, a role first introduced in 1999: Joel
Kuszai, Chris Alexander, Lori Emerson, and our longest serving moderator Amy
King. I am grateful to them for the work they have done.

While I have not been active on the list in recent years, I do follow the posts.
And over the years the list has been great company and the origin of friendships
for many of us and some great conversations.

More information on the list at
http://epc.buffalo.edu/poetics/poeticslist.html

The archives should remain in place.

debris and I won't have to know or remember anything anymore and Google can
just kick what's left around the street until the lenses are the last things
there and you walk along and find them on the sidwalk and take them and do new
things with them I won't have to know a damn thing about what you do with them

Thanks for list, Charles.
It has been an invaluable source of information and community.
Sometimes it's time to call it a day.
If this announcement means the list will be no more, I'll miss it.

Hi Folks: Re the links to the San Francisco Bay Area Poetry Reading history
(1958 - 1977) that I put up last night, There seems to be either a real
long wait or overload(!) trouble on the website, Shaping San Francisco.
Will appreciate your patience and I will re-announce when the links are hot
again.

Yes, chiming in as well. Thanks, Charles. The poetics list opened a
world up to me, a world that has continued to grow and deepen, even as
the list itself took a background role after a number of years.

The community of the List was the heart of its value for me. To follow
Mairead's question, is the List shutting down?

I began reading the Poetics List while working at book stores and bars in
Chicago, as-yet completely uncommitted to any particular direction for my
life. I picked up A Poetics with my staff discount at the Seminary Coop
Bookstore, and then stumbled onto the list somehow. I started to get
serious about poetry, and then, two years later, began the PhD program at
UB. Like most of us, I haven't really been active on the list in years, but
it played a very real role in my life. Thanks, Charles.

Dear Charles,
thank you for getting us all in touch via this great list!

I would want to take the opportunity here to say that via this list I got
to know the American poetry magazines, publishers, small presses etc.
As a result of that, I'm happy to announce that in the fall of this year,
Three Rooms Press in New York will publish an English and experimental
poetry book of mine, entitled "This is Belgian Chocolate". I will be coming
to New York for the presentation of the book and for a series of lectures
on (defining and how to analyze) visual poetry and readings/performances.
If any of you know venues or is interested in having me, please get in
touch for a bio, information....
You can find a sample of my performance work here:
http://youtu.be/AMwYDO-x2d0

Thank you again Charles for making the networking and information sharing,
calls and publication information possible. We (or at least I) will truly
miss this.

With lots of greetings from Brussels, Belgium on the other side of the
Atlantic.
All the best,

Philip

Charles;

Thank you for providing this list for some many years.
I do hope someone will take it up for another generation, as it's
important that poets keep talking to each other.

Warm Regards,
Joel

Charles,

It's been a great venue and I've met many lifetime companions through =
the list and its offshoots, so thank you for providing the opportunity.

The list is ending just as my first full-length book is becoming =
available from Blaze Vox books next month. In that I've registered =
unhappiness with the commercial nature of the list in recent years, it's =
appropriately paradoxical that my last post in this company would be to =
supply that link:

=
http://www.blazevox.org/index.php/Shop/new-releases/scholarship-by-joe-saf=
die-367/

Best regards to all far-flung correspondents. "If the Poetics List =
didn't exist, it would have to be invented" (?).

Thanks, Charles. The list has been important in my life. I started =
reading it and the Electronic Poetry Center in 1995. I'd print out =
interesting essays by you, Charles, and others, and I'd leave them in =
the coffee shop where I hosted a weekly poetry reading series in =
Victoria Canada. The essays always disappeared; people appreciated them. =
The list introduced me to many interesting poets and their poetics over =
the years.

The list was the strongest internationalist element in English poetry =
for many years, I think.=20

Many thanks, Charles, for such egalitarian use of your considerable =
'cultural capital' in creating the list and the Electronic Poetry Center =
with Loss and others. Well done. Very well done.

I too am sad to see the list go and hope that someone else will sponsor another one with such a scope. I have rarely posted but have listened intently and as a poet in the provinces learned much about the poetic landscape.

Thanks, Charles, for the service rendered to us all,

Dear Charles and everyone on "the List" --

I add my thanks to the long list of List thank-yous.  What a great
innovation in its time, Charles -- adding to all your incredible
accomplishments.  You've brought so many of together through this forum
over years.  While I often don't respond to individual posts, I read a lot
of what I receive.  I, too, have learned more about the small press and
poetics issues by reading this List.  I will be sad to open my gmail
account and not have the list-serve showing up.

Something to think about:  Does anyone else have the institutional
tech-support to start up a Poetics List 2 and take over the current email
list if so?  My university is hopelessly under-equipped technically.  But
for the poetry professors out there at tech-savvy (and better funded)
colleges, perhaps one of you could consider taking this project on.

While internet journals are not quite the same thing as a Listserve, there
is the tradition of changing institutional venues with the example of
Jacket / Jacket2 -- and How2 may have changed its institutional server
facilities midstream at least once (and will again if it ever comes back --
there's another forum that I dearly miss!)

Good wishes to you all,

Laura

Thanks, Charles, and all, for the list and your presence in my life over
the years. As a young-ish poet of the autodidact variety, one who relied on
it heavily for tidbits of information, leads to other areas of exploration,
promptings for reflection, and a sense of poetic community while I had none
in my "physical" life, it hurts to have it end. And the activity I dreamed
of instigating, once I came out of lurkdom and pleaded to these fellow
poets to share more, will have to pass in regret.

I wonder if someone is willing to carry the torch elsewhere? Or what lists
others would recommend to ease the pain?

Well, damn! I'm sorry to see the list go, but I guess you're right, its time
has come (gone). I'll miss it, and --well, THANKS, to everyone concerned. It
was a good ride. What next, I wonder (but the next is probably here already,
just like tomorrow).

I've been a lurker in recent years; not so when I first was on the list a
long time ago.  But the list has been an invaluable source of "deep gossip,"
a sense of what is going in in the diffuse, dispersed poetry communities.  I
will miss it, and I hope something besides Facebook emerges to take its
place.

Charles, perhaps a final American Graffiti moment to tell us where they =
are now, the men and women who started this strange utopian project and =
whose names were once as familiar to me as my own?

Maybe that's the urge of the novelist, not the poet.

Thanks for doing this,

I'm going to miss it.  I've discovered some interesting  journals and
websites here, and met interesting people.  All of whom were gracious to me
even when I was clueless.  Since my day job is stay-at-home dad, it's been
a great connection into the greater world of poetry.

So long and thanks for all the fish.

Best,
Marc Thompson

Before there was blogging, before there was Facebook, before there were so
many newer sites I don't know much about,  there was the Buffalo Poetics
List as a gathering place for poets and their friends. A toast, as mIEKAL
said, to Charles and to all who participated."So we row on..."

Charles,

Thank you for a useful and
inspiring forum that has sustained
and promoted a unique poetic
community for many years.

(Also want to point out re: recent posts that there were feminist and
other poetics newsgroups before that got spammed into close to non-
existence, and the BBS systems carried similar - lists/listserves were
only one of the early forms of dissemination. That said, however - )

I do wish the list could continue under other auspices; it provides an
incredible service that really can't be replaced by IM or Facebook
pages... It's difficult enough to find out about poetry/poetics events,
publications, content, even with the list; without it, those of us out of
the imminent NYC scene are a bit at a loss -

- Alan

Dear Charles,

Me too.

The Poetics list has been a great resource for me, especially living, as I
do, in Sydney Australia.
I loved the early discussions and I have met some invaluable longterm
poetry friends on this list.

Thank you,
Every best wish to you & fellow poeticists,
Pam

Salute

Nothing, this spume, virgin verse
Only to point to the cup;
So afar many a troupe
Of sirens drowns in reverse.

We navigate, O my diverse
Friends, me now on the poop
You the sumptuous prow to reap
Lightnings and seasons perverse;

A fine ivresse brings me
Fearless of its very pitch
To bear upright this salute

Solitude, reef, star
To whatever is worth
The white concern of our sheet.

One thing that will be sorely lacking After Poetics List is a virtual space
for  calls for poetry of a more experimental, conceptual, language and/or
multi-media hybrid aesthetic.  The on-line general versions of such lists
that I've found are hopelessly muddled with a zillion publications, many of
which are alien to radical  "innovative work."

Without defining what that is (I'm not gonna do that), the PL has provided
some narrowing of that gap. It's been a huge service, just for posting
practical poetics info. and announcements to a more specific audience.

As large as it is, Poetics List has a kind of community impetus and pulse.

Thus, unless someone knows about an alternative space serving this function
already, we might, for example, start a Facebook page that is updated
monthly with those announcement type materials.  I don't know how this
would work. There should still be a moderator.  (Amy, are you still
available? Any volunteers?)

Ironically, since I am a blogger and do all kinds of interactive work
myself, Facebook is the software I am least familiar with.  And I don't
like the advertising and snoop-ware.   I would have to investigate these
possibilities.  But I'm happy to try to get something going.

We also need a space to announce calls for papers for conferences on
poetics, advertisements for new blog poetics posts and journals, even a
space for remembrances of those poets who've passed.

Please advise.  You can backchannel me at my personal email for on-going
discussion:
laurahinton12@gmail.com.

And you can "friend" me on Facebook if you are interested in being on a
potential list:

I wonder how many people are subbed to the Poetics list?  It would be a
simple matter to start another list..

$400 artist/writer looking for a cheap room (Victoria)
I'm looking to rent a room anywhere biking distance to Oak
Bay. Central locations ideal. I work at a BC Liquor store
and I am leaving my apartment Aug 1st. I am extremely clean
and organized. I barely ever drink alcohol these days. I do
smoke pot every once in a while and cigarettes outside
occasionally.
I am considerate, and quiet. I don't have much stuff except
recording equipment I will store in the corner of my room. I
like to write music quietly (for the most part) in the
mornings. Cheaper the better, I'm learning to live with
less.

I am a marine ecologist and young professional working at
Cal Poly. During times off I like to surf, ski (especially
backcountry), climb/boulder, do adventures of all sorts,
listen to music (I have 400+ vinyl records), brew beer and
make wine (I'm not very good at it, but hey), work on the
house/property, and of course eat good food with good
friends. I am hoping to find like-minded renters who are fun
and adventurous, as well as respectful of this beautiful
house and our neighborhood.

Rent is $1000 (master bedroom) or $900 (regular bedroom) per
month, plus utilities.

Master Bedroom with walk-in closet. Slider off Living room
to private patio & garden area & storage unit. Nicely
landscaped community grounds, community pool & Clubhouse.

Really Nice Fully Furnished Bedroom. $375 month. $125
deposit. Queen bed, dresser, lamps, TV, Table w/chair, and
loveseat. 1 mile W of downtown The Dalles. Large yard with a
country like setting. Good parking, Rent includes utilities,
cable, internet. Includes all linens, towels, bedding. Share
kitchen appliances and accessories, bathroom with
tub-shower, laundry room with washer and dryer. Cat okay, if
you already have one. 541-980-933four

HOW ABOUT A CURRENT TESTIMONY OF SEEING GOD'S LOVE IN
ACTION?

ANYONE GOT AN EXTRA TRAILER FOR THE HOMELESS???
P L E A S E H E L P ! ! ! ~ CALL MARK @ 805-391-4008
LOOKING FOR A TRAILER FOR YOU TO DONATE OR LOAN OUT FOR A
WHILE THAT IS 25' OR LESS SO CAN HAVE A HOME FOR TWO
HOMELESS PEOPLE. ~ PLEASE PRAY ABOUT IT & CALL ME. THANKS,
MARK
Looking to help some homeless people have a place to live.
Need to either borrow or have you donate 25' or less
trailer's to move into trailer park in Atascadero. The fee
is half the price of renting one already in place (for empty
space). Most homeless who receive some income can afford
that if they do not have to pay for the space with trailer
included. I will make a commitment to follow through with
trailer condition & if one homeless person does not work
out, will make sure some other homeless get the opportunity.
If you have such a trailer or know someone who is willing to
donate one, please let me know. If someone had a space to
park the trailer with R.V. hook ups walking distance to
town, that woi
Thanks & God bless you. ~ Call Mark Nellesen @ 805-391-4009

Alan,

I knew that when I made the point about the Buffalo Listserv preceding
blogging, someone would supply corrected information. If this was years ago
I might have even guessed that it would be you! Seeing your work on here is
one of the things I have missed, and having heard you've recently moved, I
hope all is going well with you!

Best wishes,
Nick

For those of you sad to lose something so valuable to the world of poetry

I could host a poetics list by creating a poetics list category at Listen an=

http://www.listenandbeheard.net/poetry/
Registered users could post to that category. It could be moderated, but not=
 by me entirely....

If there's interest just let me know.

I think, one way or another, the list should continue; Fb is bad for a
number of reasons: it's noisy, the feeds are noisy, the privacy settings
are arcane, things get lost in the mix, the constant advertising -
including advertising in the midst of the feeds now - is bad, it's easy to
spoof or hack, there are too many bells and whistles graphics, the mobile
apps are limited, the software keeps trying to get you to fill out more
personal information, discussions are often derailed, and a monthly
updating of anything online is simply too slow at this point. Email is far
more secure, leaner, runs on a variety of clients, is easy to use on
mobile, and comes to you; you can also save emails in a directory for
future reference. I'd like to see someone take over the list at this point
and I hope that Charles would allow it to continue running until that
might be a real possibility, at least a week or two.

Thanks, Alan

Please add my appreciation of Charles and the list managers to all of the c=
ollected expressions thus far. No future representation of poetry and poeti=
cs of the last 20 years will be sufficient without taking into account the =
community, activity, and influence of the Poetics list.=20

As for ways to carry forward (re: Laura Hinton and others), I would think t=
hat an invitation-only blog (through Wordpress, for example) would work sim=
ilarly to this listserv, though I'm not sure a digest option would be possi=
ble.=20

With gratitude,
Brian Clements

Subject: What will be missed =85

One thing that will be sorely lacking After Poetics List is a virtual space
for  calls for poetry of a more experimental, conceptual, language and/or
multi-media hybrid aesthetic.  The on-line general versions of such lists
that I've found are hopelessly muddled with a zillion publications, many of
which are alien to radical  "innovative work."

Without defining what that is (I'm not gonna do that), the PL has provided
some narrowing of that gap. It's been a huge service, just for posting
practical poetics info. and announcements to a more specific audience.

As large as it is, Poetics List has a kind of community impetus and pulse.

Thus, unless someone knows about an alternative space serving this function
already, we might, for example, start a Facebook page that is updated
monthly with those announcement type materials.  I don't know how this
would work. There should still be a moderator.  (Amy, are you still
available? Any volunteers?)

Ironically, since I am a blogger and do all kinds of interactive work
myself, Facebook is the software I am least familiar with.  And I don't
like the advertising and snoop-ware.   I would have to investigate these
possibilities.  But I'm happy to try to get something going.

We also need a space to announce calls for papers for conferences on
poetics, advertisements for new blog poetics posts and journals, even a
space for remembrances of those poets who've passed.

Please advise.  You can backchannel me at my personal email for on-going
discussion:

And you can "friend" me on Facebook if you are interested in being on a
potential list:

The Robinson Jeffers listserv has been shuffled around from one academic =

at this point, the Association is working to move it to a non-academic =

but I know it is being done.  I believe the RJA is looking to move the =
listserv to Dotster, which hosts the RJA website.

In response to Laura Hinton and others wanting to continue the conversati=
on. I=20
too am in support of trying to continue the list in another format, and t=
he idea of=20
a Wordpress based discussion forum could work well. There are server load=
=20
issues with the email format of a list serv in that most server accounts =
have a=20
limit on the number of emails that can be sent per hour, so a list like t=
his could=20
potentially overwhelm such an account (university or corporate server acc=
ounts=20
don't have these restrictions, but are also expensive). So, a Wordpress h=
osted=20
discussion forum, without the mass email sending requirements might be a=20=

solution to this. It would need to be hosted on its own server (not at=20=

Wordpres.com) so that we could customize as needed (maybe have category=20=

filters so you can look for discussions, calls for work, etc.). I could h=
ost it on the=20
Chicago School of Poetics site, but I'd like to see if there is any inter=
est in this=20
first as it would be some work to set up.

Also, you can back channel me at: poet@francescolevato.com

Many thanks to Charles and all the moderators for providing this resource=
.

Best,
Francesco

I am with Alan. I hate to see things go. Facebook has derailed us all.

And thank you to Charles Bernstein, and all who have worked hard to keep
this list going.
Best wishes,

Count me in on this project.   I love Wordpress =85 the only problem I've h=
ad
is dealing with a volume of users on a given site (ie., students), but it
sounds like your server can handle that.  I've used Wordpress now many
times; the free software is clean to use and it can look great.  And I
agree with Alan that Facebook has all those problems.

I'm looking forward to working with you, Francesco.  Poetics List 2
everyone?

I am grateful for the many notes posted here in response to the closing of
the Poetics List. I want to thank, especially, Amy King, who has kept the
list going for the past years with considerable dedication and effort: her
generosity and acuity is appreciated. There seems considerable interest in
starting something new to take up where this list has left off. And it must be
new, to meet the demands of the present. Onward!

Amy is a force of nature, as are you, Charles.
Thank you both, and all moderators and generous contributors.
I think Jonathan said it best, with poetry (for a shaky second I thought he
had actually *just written that!*).
It's great to see the energy being picked up too.
The list has died!  Long live the list!

Jim

I just looked at this site, and see several people from the Poetics List
are already involved.
I like email discussion lists for conversation and announcements better
than blogs, and this looks to me the way to continue this list.

Best Regards,
Joel

Say what you will about Facebook, it does have certain advantages over =
lists. Though I would like to see something better emerge that people =
will use as widely.

One of the advantages is that you don't have to get information from =
people who bore you. You can just block their posts. I know lots of =
poets don't like that idea, of people being able to easily block others =
from their info feed, but it's clearly a very good thing. A list is like =
being in one single room with everyone subscribed to the list. It gets =
old in a hurry. Windbags get at least equal time with more interesting =
folks.

The Facebook options on what information you get and to whom you send =
info are much more granular than list options. Those sorts of options =
are important, and they never materialized in listserv software. Lists =
needed a more contemporary architecture of the group, of discussion, and =
of the missive concerning who receives it based on permissions.

a hybrid interface of facebook/twitter/blog/listserv would involve a bit
more design but in the end could operate effortlessly. the real question is
moderation or no moderation.'

I also think a discussion list would be the best way to go.

I become more aware each semester, as new internet courses, super sites, a=

This reminds me a bit of the old days.  I'm actually reading what everybody=
 posts=2C because there's a genuine discussion=2C an exchange.  Who knew?

I neglected to thank Charles in my earlier post=2C as well as everyone else=
 who has been involved.  I think Amy King's tenure as listmod=2C though=2C =
has been particularly noteworthy.  I think she deserves special thanks=2C w=
hether or not you agree with Miekal=97 and I certainly think he has a point=
=97 that moderation has not served the list well in the long run.  Whether =
or not *moderation* is good for the list or not=2C though=2C is an entirely=
 separate matter from the various moderators themselves.  All have been ver=
y good=2C but Amy King did it for incredibly long=2C and her tenure seems t=
o have been seamless=2C without controversy.  (I say 'seems=2C' of course=
=2C because I haven't been reading every post=2C like I did in the old days=
.)

This list=2C clearly=2C has been a special exchange for many of us=2C at le=
ast at some time or another=2C and that energy still exists and clearly (no=
t just for myself) needs another outlet.  I am hoping we can collectively f=
igure out how to channel it.  I agree with those who said (as I previously =
said) that FB is not a good medium for such an exchange.  I personally like=
 the listserv/email technological model=2C but that may not work for most p=
eople=2C especially as technology evolves.  I agree that the need exists=2C=
 not just for discussion and exchange of ideas=2C but for basic information=
 as to what's going on.  I never thought that calls for work or publication=
 announcements were inherently less important than exchange of ideas.  Alan=
 Sondheim usefully points out that for those of us who do not live in NYC o=
r=2C perhaps=2C SF=2C the List is a much-needed vehicle to grasp the full s=
cope of literary activity in our time=2C much less to figure out where=2C w=
hen or if we want to "submit."  The fact of moderation has limited the spon=
taneity of exchange=2C and as a result exchange itself.  Yet it is ALSO tru=
e that flamers and narcissists=2C when they arise (and they will=2C eventua=
lly) need to quietly and efficiently be moved aside.  Can there be spontane=
ity within moderation?  Can there be collective ways of dealing with the fl=
amers which bypass listmods?  Who knows?

Let the Poetics List 2 begin=2C either through institutional sponsorship or=
 "under that table=2C" so to speak.  (And=2C thinking ecologically=2C I won=
der which model would be more sustainable=2C for a generation or more.)

Laura Hinton=2C I'm in=97 whatever evolves.

What's that Pound line about "commerce between us?"

Yours in (poetic) struggle=97

Self-moderation among adults could go a long way, mIEKAL aND, on the other
hand, besides being "OLD" since the beginning, how many adults are around
here?

I logically wanted to write the opposite, since your mail invited for a
"let it go free". The mysteries of writing.

Obviously, I'm a fan of the most minimal moderation possible, but poetry
and logorrhea seem to go hand in hand.  Quite frankly it's a bit of delight
to see all these all posting their fond farewells, I had no idea so many of
these folks were still subscribed since a lot of them haven't posted in
years.  Digital community is the real work=97takes attention and care.  And
restraint.

mIEKAL, aren't Lists part of the digital world, though in a "primitive,"
what Chris calls prehistoric sort of way? Jim believes, I think, that if
technology enable something to be done digitally, then it should be done.

Hi, Mark,

I think by "moderation" mIEKAL meant not a moderator, but the imposition of
restraint. I agree with mIEKAL that moderation served us badly. At the end,
while it helped the List survive as a central posting medium to announce
poetry events and publications, it resulted in the atrophy of the List as a
forum for heated intellectual exchange.

Someone should consolidate the various proposals put forward, and if she
or he can put a structure in place quickly, please announce, so that the
list population could sign up. Otherwise you might not be able to reach
all the folks who would benefit from the transfer.

Thanks, Alan

I agree. A wordpress site would be great for the list, better than a Faceboo=
k page. That's why I offered to host at first. But I have limited resources,=
 so I certainly don't covet the hosting part...

I could help a little on the wordpress side of things. Since everyone would h=
ave the option to subscribe to particular threads, moderation might not be a=
s necessary as it was perceived to be in the list format. Those who like a l=
ist, could still get their list in an email.

All those presently on the list could be sent a one time invitation to join t=
he new one, if Charles would be comfortable with that.

I am an active administrator in several Facebook pages, most function with
minimal moderation overseen by 3 or 4 admins. They seem to work pretty
seamlessly with the occasional outbursts of course. On the positive side,
they can be set up in a matter of minutes and can be migrated to different
platforms at a moment's notice if necessary. Coordinating the page with
Twitter and other sites is a real plus. All in all I think it is fabulous
that people want to see the idea survive.

On Facebook or on a blog or whatever, posts can be moderated by the =
'owner' of the discussion. On Facebook, that's whomever's wall the =
discussion originates on. The role of moderator is decentralized. Rather =
than one big moderator there are as many as there are discussions. I =
think that's quite a useful model. Having no moderators at all is not an =
option for most serious forums.

All of the lists that I'm on have declined in traffic or interest, becoming more bulletin boards than anything else. I suspect that Facebook has largely replaced them.

I think it is true that Facebook has largely replaced "lists," but the qual=
ity of discussions has not been as good.=20


For many many years Poetics and WomPo were my lifeline, and I miss the lite=
rary discussions and even the fights we used to have. The back and forth wa=
s sustained over long periods and I used to love reading about a thread for=
 days and perhaps weeks on end. I met like-minded folks and, for me, it fil=
led the gap between when I finished grad school in 93 and was thrust out in=
to the 'real world" where I often had to take mindless day jobs just to get=
 by.


Thank you for this list! I was sometimes an avid participant and other time=
s a lurker but always grateful for its existence.

I first thank Charles and Amy for all the hard work that goes into keeping =
something like this going. Ironically=2C I live in NYC now moving from Bflo=
 in '04=2C but I found the list incredibly informative in all ways - events=
=2C calls for work=2C thoughts on poetics - and even tho I lived in one of =
those cultural center cities=2C I the list still kept me informed of things=
 I wouldn't know about otherwise. While I didn't join til the mid 00's I tr=
uly feel it fosters a sense of community. There were many things and even n=
yc events posted on this list that I did not find out about otherwise.  (tr=
ue=2C i'm not on FB...)

I think Tyrone and Alan have some really good points and I hope to be in on=
 the next list. I agree that FB is not going to do it for many reasons that=
 Alan stated. Some of you may be aware of a similar list but in the innovat=
ive/experimental film world called Frameworks and it's still a heady mix of=
 opinion/personal exchanges=2C very robust calls for work=2C queries on fil=
ms/sources/artists and curatorial leads. Most experimental film fests put t=
heir calls out there=3B though I'm not sure if that could be replicated wit=
h all poetry journals - it would be great if the list was made known someho=
w to interested parties. I know there's things like Harriet the Poetry Foun=
dation blog=2C but while it does perhaps have some similarities it is not a=
 personal exchange email list that can be more intimate and focused on inno=
vative poetics.

I do hope the list can continue as Francesco wishes and perhaps garner the =
current folks and get new folks in.

Thank you Charles=2C Alan=2C Tyrone=2C Jonathan for all the eloquent words =
said these last couple days.

I just checked out the Wordpress site initiated by Francesco ... It looks gr=
eat!  It will run more like an Internet thread site (message board), per sub=
ject category....and might even be more practical and topic-oriented than th=
e out-going Listserve model.  The message board might encourage more active p=
articipation on given specific subjects.=20

 Francesco needs volunteers, though, to help monitor the flow of posts.

Subject:      New discussion board open
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="ISO-8859-1"

Ok, I have a first run of the new discussion board online at:

http://poeticslist.chicagoschoolofpoetics.com/

This is just a start. If the discussion board proves useful in continuing=
 the work=20
of the Buffalo Poetics List, I will work to update and improve it based o=
n=20
member suggestions (I have a forum set up to post suggestions). Also, ple=
ase=20
feel free leave any feedback you may have in the =93Feedback=94 forum.

Some initial notes:

The design of the discussion board is minimalist. I didn=92t want the int=
erface to=20
interfere with usability. I am open to suggestions though.&#8232;

There seemed to be a balance of pros and cons for moving the list discuss=
ions to=20
Facebook or other social media platforms, so I=92m going to try and addre=
ss some=20
of those suggestions in the current discussion board=92s functionality. &=
amp;#8232;

Filtering posts: while we can block posts from certain users (as on FB), =
I thought=20
implementing a way to filter posts by category (if you chose) would be us=
eful.=20
So, I=92ve added a series of category tags to start with for this purpose=
=20
(publications, book releases, announcements, opportunities, discussion, e=
vents,=20
readings, and submissions). When you post you can also suggest your own t=
ags=20
to expand on this list.&#8232;

Notifications to your FB wall: I will be creating a FB page that will aut=
omatically=20
be receiving posts made to the discussion board for those of you who woul=
d=20
rather follow the list on FB.&#8232;
Twitter: for those of you would would rather receive list notifications v=
ia twitter,=20
I=92ve set up an account for the list @PoeticsList. The discussion baord =
will=20
automatically tweet new posts to this Twitter feed (this is in the works =
but will=20
be ready soon).&#8232;

A note on moderation: to avoid the board being spammed by trolls or autom=
ated=20
spambots, I think it=92s best to keep it a moderated discussion. So, it w=
ill still be a=20
short wait before your post is approved. I could use some volunteer moder=
ators=20
to help, so if you=92re interested please email me at:=20
poeticslist@chicagoschoolofpoetics.com&#8232;

Registration: again, to avoid spam we will need to have users register be=
fore=20
they can post. There=92s no approval process, just register and start pos=
ting.&#8232;

Hosting: I=92m hosting this on the CSoP=92s server, but it is intended fo=
r all members=20
of the former Buffalo Poetics List. So, rather than having you go to CSoP=
=92s main=20
website to access the board, I installed it on a subdomain. When you clic=
k on the=20
link listed above you will be taken directly into the discusion board.&am=
p;#8232;

And finally, the Buffalo Poetics List has been a daily stop for me for ma=
ny years.=20
I appreciate all the list has offered and the community involved in it. S=
etting up=20
the Poetics List @ Chicago School of Poetics is just a way for me to give=
 back to=20
that community. I hope you ind it useful.


Best,
Francesco Levato

I'm working on an initial run of a discussion board that incorporates some
of the
ideas brought up so far. Sorry for my absence after my initial post, but
it's taken
a bit to set this up. I should have a link ready to post to ugh new
discussion
board later today and I'll post that along with some additional thoughts on

project.

To those of you who have expressed interest in helping, thank you, I could

it. We'll definitely need moderators, so please back channel me at

You cannot politically defy the institutions when all you
really wanted was to be clasped to their bosoms and hope in
time to be cherished under the very framework of oppressive
values you are thinking of overcoming. That would be
co-optation, revolution only in the sense of a circulation
of elites rather than the extirpation of the very impulses
of elitism.

Thank you for this list Charles.

As a mere 'blow-in' of seven years lurking, this list has been
inspirational and informative, providing a connection to an otherworld I'd
rarely encounter otherwise.

Thanks to all who posted and gave it life.

Michael.

I think monitoring is ultimately a good thing. The internet is a place
where people feel free to be abusive and say things they would never say in
public.

I had a bad experience with this with Roxann Gay. She published an article
I wrote on disability poetics (ok, it was the wrong forum) but people wrote
in ruthlessly mocking me... one guy wrote "Is having a small dick a
disability?"

I know this is difficult because the question becomes "who is the
gatekeeper?" and the moderation becomes at their personal discretion. Amy
King, in fact, was a good person to do this because she has a wide
awareness of prejudice. Most people do not. Most people do not even think
of prejudice against disability and have their own prejices, so it is not
something people willingly stand up against.

I guess I am just saying that if you have controversial views, not even
snarky ones or fighting for the sake of fighting, but truly controversial
views (but this i mean my view that poets and people with disabilities have
nothing wrong with them and should be treated as equals in the poetry
community, employment, dating and sexuality) you are going to be attacked.
When I called Paul Guest on letting himself be called 'invalid" on his book
cover by John Ashbery. I was brutally attacked, and Guest actually won that
discussion. HE WON THE RIGHT TO HAVE SOMEONE CALL HIM AN INVALID~!
CONGRATUALTIONS!

All I am saying is having a moderator helps people like me who are trying
to put forth controversial opinions and are also sensitive and loving and
have a super hard time being attacked. Love, Jennifer

When does "controversial" turn into "abusive"?  Is there a clear
demarcation? For instance, is irony abusive and sincerity controversial?

Contraversial to me means putting forth an unpopular opinion in a tempered
manner. It used to be gay rights, or rights for people of color, now, for
me, it's any resistance against disability as anything but a tradegty or
something to be avoided.

Abuse is name calling. Putting people down. Cruel comments that don't add
to the discussion - such as Paul Guest calling my writing and arguments
that quality of a bad first-year writing student. Or when some guys from a
list-serv read my blog post regarding the word retarded and posted my
picture on their site ruthlessly making fun of me and attacking me and
emailed me at the university to make sure I looked at it, Or the times I
have been told online that I am a disgrace to all disabled people and
should shut up. That is abuse... have you had this happen to you?

 Last posts, but change is good, seems to be facing towards further.
Thank you Charles and each set of moderators who made it work for so long.
Signed up a long time ago but not early, internet access a problem.
Since with sporadic, intermittent, then continuous access those email
reminders of poets & past poetic pleasantries/ platitudes/ plaints/ pleas/
rants were often fun. Though I have mostly lurked it did mean I was not as
cut off.
I thought Alan Sondheim, Jim Andrews, Amy Ballardini and MiKEAL aND above
were all sounding out useful pointers
Best,
Catherine Walsh..

Murat (and others),

I'm just curious if you feel your ideas and self have ever been attacked on
the internet to this degree? I even had a poet write to tell me that she
quit the WomPo list because of my beliefs of disability.

Hi, reJennifer,

As far as I am concerned with, the hardest thing the poet suffers from the
public is indifference. I am not questioning your right to put forward or
defend or argue for your position. If they are truly controversial, as you
say you are, people will react to it, not necessarily the way you like. It
means they read what you wrote. You can respond or ignore them. There have
always been poets with disabilities. Homer, if an actual person, was blind.
Alexander Pope was a dwarf. I am sure others can add to the list.
Generalizing the term, all of us have our weaknesses and strength. The
interactions of both create the quality, the nature of the work.

Dear everyone --

Note that Francesco Levato has started up a WORDPRESS INCARNATION of our
Poetics List.  But you have to sign up for the site yourselves.  We are not
collecting emails!

As per his earlier message below, you just go to the link:

http://poeticslist.chicagoschoolofpoetics.com/

Follow the instructions to log in.   I did this no problem.  (Feel free to
backchannel me if you have an issue. I'll see if I can help you solve it.)

And great news -- Amy King has agreed to moderate!

I just wanted to re-annouince this new development so you all sign on, and
also to note we should heartily thank Francesco and now Amy for making this
continuation of a moderated posting Poetics List site possible.

In gratitude to both,
Laura

Well, all the years of lurking, reading, clicking links are over. Thanks to
Charles for starting it all and to everyone who kept it going, and here's
to the next stage.

Best to all

It's better than the movies.  Comments, rebuttals, gratitudes, future lives.
In the cold and snow, thank you for a warm weekend with endless conversation.
And to Charles who began something that has sustained so many poets.  To
Amy for taking up the reins and now again, to begin anew with a cast that
puts the Oscars barely in competition.  Yes, I'm a lurker but now digging in.
Thank you for this amazing opportunity. And deepest gratitude.

That said=2C I believe what Jennifer is describing is abusive responses to =

ur point=2C Jennifer=2C unless I misread you=2C is that some of the respons=

I also think we should thank Francesco and Amy.  This is thankless work for=

an set now that might make this process easier/more transparent going forwa=
rd?  Amy=2C what ground rules have you used (or which ones would you sugges=

I think this might be an important discussion to have sooner than later.

I've helped shape the moderation guidelines for music forums before, and
the main concerns I've seen formulated surround spamming (by bots and
individuals), breaking forum rules, and acts of disrespect, aggression,
etc. Spamming and rule-breaking I've found to be generally self-evident,
disrespect/aggression a bunch of blurry lines. It can help if there are
multiple moderators, and a moderators' thread where questionable behavior
is brought for review and action, whether by unanimity, majority, whatever.
It can also help to have moderator behavior open for questioning, and have
at least one rotating moderator spot if someone's willing to manage that
and there are enough willing participants.

Mark,

Of course, Larry Eigner is behind all these discussions.

I am aware there is a difference between disagreement and abuse, but I
don't think that distinction in the periphery is always that clear. A
response that has an emotional edge to it (why should there not be if the
issues are important), may possibly seen by the other party as abusive
while it may not be so. For instance, is an ironic or sarcastic response
abusive? That is why I began this discussion by asking that question.

Hi Mark,

Thank you so much for your support - it makes me feel really heard.

You mentioned Eigner. I am writing a biography on him, doing some archival
work, and assisting with permissions for his works. It's a non-stop
adventure.

Yes, I haven't spoken about irt publicly, but once I wrote a "column" on my
blog about using the word 'retarded." Some creeps got ahold of my
photograph and put my picture up on their list-serv mocking me ruthlessly.
They emailed me both at home and Montclair state (where I taught) to make
sure I saw it.

This was devastating. I also got quite a bit of slack for calling Paul
Guest out on letting Ashbery refer to him as "invalid" as did also mary
Kerr. You would think that respecting the rights of people with
disabilities is a no-brainer. But, really, it is controversial and when I
speak up often I am shot down or ignored. Although I realize that my opions
are extreme...I for example am perfectly happy having cerebral palsy - it's
just who I am! But most want to pity you or believe you would be better off
abled and that you wish for that. When you say - I'm disabled and happy
with who I am - people will react strongly and negatively.

That said, I haven't had much trouble on the list, here. I think Amy has
been a gem. And I have chosen to speak up minimally here because (really) I
feel as a girl poet, I am speaking into an empty well & many of my comments
are just ignored. Also, since I am uber-sensitive, I am attempting to back
away from the internet entirely.

I did take issue, recently, with some criticism here that I felt critized
Lisa Jarnot, instead of her writing, and I wrote about that. But, overall,
the list has been pretty safe for me and I met some wonderful folks, namely
my assistant, Eric.

Hi - We've been running the wryting-l list since around 1994, when it
started as fiction-of-philosophy; it's a list for experimental writing and
announcements as well. You can find out more and join through

http://clc.wvu.edu/projects/wryting_l

The list is unmoderated.

Please have a look; I think it would be of interest to anyone subscribed
to Poetics.

- Thanks, Alan

The University at Buffalo is launching a new MA in Innovative Writing
Program--a unique form of graduate study in creative writing, closely
intertwining the practice of writing with literary and aesthetic
inquiries. Our hope is to create an environment in which new forms of
writing will flourish. Poetry. Fiction. Hybrid forms. Digital and
electronic media. However innovation takes place.

Faculty:
Myung Mi Kim, Judith Goldman, Nnedi Okorafor, Christina Milletti and
Dimitri Anastasopoulos

For more information, visit:
http://www.buffalo.edu/content/cas/english/graduate/ma-certificate-in-innovative-writing.html

Application deadline: Feb 1...though we expect to accept applications on
a rolling basis this first year.
Please share with your colleagues and students!

Hi everyone,

I, too, have mainly lurked on this list.  But I have enjoyed the
announcements and discussions immensely.  Thanks to Charles and Amy for all
their hard work.  Look forward to seeing you all on the interface,

>> $400 artist/writer looking for a cheap room (Victoria)
>> I'm looking to rent a room anywhere biking distance to Oak
>> Bay. Central locations ideal. I work at a BC Liquor store
>> and I am leaving my apartment Aug 1st. I am extremely clean
>> and organized. I barely ever drink alcohol these days. I do
>> smoke pot every once in a while and cigarettes outside
>> occasionally.
>> I am considerate, and quiet. I don't have much stuff except
>> recording equipment I will store in the corner of my room. I
>> like to write music quietly (for the most part) in the
>> mornings. Cheaper the better, I'm learning to live with
>> less.
>>
>> I am a marine ecologist and young professional working at
>> Cal Poly. During times off I like to surf, ski (especially
>> backcountry), climb/boulder, do adventures of all sorts,
>> listen to music (I have 400+ vinyl records), brew beer and
>> make wine (I'm not very good at it, but hey), work on the
>> house/property, and of course eat good food with good
>> friends. I am hoping to find like-minded renters who are fun
>> and adventurous, as well as respectful of this beautiful
>> house and our neighborhood.
>>
>> Rent is $1000 (master bedroom) or $900 (regular bedroom) per
>> month, plus utilities.
>>
>> Master Bedroom with walk-in closet. Slider off Living room

>> cable, internet. Includes all linens, towels, bedding. Share

>> Looking to help some homeless people have a place to live.
>> Need to either borrow or have you donate 25' or less

Girl poet. That has a quaint sound, but I like it. Is it ok with you girls? I am in my 70s, so I can adopt any new language level. Girl poets. I welcome you. Maybe I can whip up some biscuits. Come visit me, please. Write!

Hi Mark,

Thank you so much for your support - it makes me feel really heard.

You mentioned Eigner. I am writing a biography on him, doing some archival
work, and assisting with permissions for his works. It's a non-stop
adventure.

Yes, I haven't spoken about irt publicly, but once I wrote a "column" on my
blog about using the word 'retarded." Some creeps got ahold of my
photograph and put my picture up on their list-serv mocking me ruthlessly.
They emailed me both at home and Montclair state (where I taught) to make
sure I saw it.

This was devastating. I also got quite a bit of slack for calling Paul
Guest out on letting Ashbery refer to him as "invalid" as did also mary
Kerr. You would think that respecting the rights of people with
disabilities is a no-brainer. But, really, it is controversial and when I
speak up often I am shot down or ignored. Although I realize that my opions
are extreme...I for example am perfectly happy having cerebral palsy - it's
just who I am! But most want to pity you or believe you would be better off
abled and that you wish for that. When you say - I'm disabled and happy
with who I am - people will react strongly and negatively.

That said, I haven't had much trouble on the list, here. I think Amy has
been a gem. And I have chosen to speak up minimally here because (really) I
feel as a girl poet, I am speaking into an empty well & many of my comments
are just ignored. Also, since I am uber-sensitive, I am attempting to back
away from the internet entirely.

I did take issue, recently, with some criticism here that I felt critized
Lisa Jarnot, instead of her writing, and I wrote about that. But, overall,
the list has been pretty safe for me and I met some wonderful folks, namely
my assistant, Eric.

That said, I believe what Jennifer is describing is abusive responses to
her position. Look, anyone is entitled to his or her opinion (expressed
appropriately, and with appropriate regard for others). Murat has a point
that if you know it will be seen as "controversial" (I myself don't
necessarily see why that would be the case, based on what Jennifer writes)
then you should expect, and be prepared for, some pushback. However, your
point, Jennifer, unless I misread you, is that some of the responses you
have received have gone *beyond* controversy toward abuse or borderline
abuse. And I find that stunning. I'm not sure what to tell you except, if
you can find the courage, don't let yourself be silenced. And if you need
supporters in these (did you say they were online?) forums, maybe some of
the members of this list would be willing to turn out electronically to
call abuse what it is. I'd be willing. Send me a message, including info
on how to create an account, if that happens again. Perhaps also provide
more details/context.
Is anyone else in? It's really not cool to behave abusively toward the
differently abled, whether online or in person. Let's call that behavior
out.

Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

Kenning Editions is proud to announce the publication of /Tarnac, a
preparatory act
<http://www.kenningeditions.com/shop/tarnac-a-preparatory-act/>/, by
Jean-Marie Gleize--translated from the French by Joshua Clover, Abigail
Lang, and Bonnie Roy. The book is available at a discount: $12.00
through Friday when you purchase directly from the press.

Published in 2011 by Editions du Seuil, /Tarnac, un acte préparatoire/
interrogates in poetic form the fallout from and precedent for the
notorious cause célèbre of the "Tarnac Nine"---associated with the
Invisible Committee, pseudonymous authors of /The Coming Insurrection/.
It is his Anglo-American debut full-length, though as editor of the
journal /Nioques/, he is well-known to American readers for, among other
things, importing to France the work of some more daring poets from the
U.S. In translation, /Tarnac/, a preparatory act not only lends insight
into radical aesthetic politics that characterize ongoing
transatlantic---indeed global---intellectual affinities, but it
introduces to American readers an inestimably important figure of French
letters.

    Jean-Marie Gleize considers the implication of an arrest for
    something "preparatory," that is, something like speech. // Can a
    poem (a preliminary act) be insurrectionary? // Poem as "black
    positive" as in a photograph of a dark surface--Charles Bernstein

Poetry / Literature, Paperback, 176 pages, ISBN: 9780984647538, details
and orders here.
<http://www.kenningeditions.com/shop/tarnac-a-preparatory-act/>

You will also enjoy a discount if you subscribe to receive Tarnac, The
Compleat Purge by Trisha Low, and PQRS by Patrick Durgin, bundled for
$35.00. <http://www.kenningeditions.com/shop/kenning-editions-subscription/>

re-Jennifer,

I said "Larry Eigner is behind all these discussions" both because, in our
time, he is the prominent poet with disabilities and also because I was
aware you are writing a biography of him.

I must say the reaction to your column about the word "retarded" you
described is beyond the pale. I was not referring to that kind of atrocious
behaviour. On the other hand, if Paul Guest is O.K. with being described as
"invalid" by Ashbery, what right do you have to object to it? I am aware
that "invalid" has the connotation "mot valid" in it. Is that your
objection, the suggestion that  disabilities make a person invalid?

By the way, Tom Savage suffers from epilepsy. There is another (his name
eludes me now) who suffers from Tourette Syndrome.

Ciao,
Murat

Hi - Can we have a list somewhere - before time runs out - of all the
possibilities for the Poetics Diaspora?

We're running Wryting, at
http://clc.wvu.edu/projects/wryting_l
for creative work and announcements;

there's another Poetics list that Amy is running?
and there's New-Poetics and the Poetics forum?

- Please clarify; what worries me is redundancy or dispersion here -

Thanks greatly, Alan

dear jennifer--

i am reading the iliad right now to teach it in a few hours. it is no
accident to me that "crippled" hephaestus is the god of fire and makes for
achilles his most beautiful shield that contains the whole world in it.

Jennifer Bartlett!

Hi Murat, The list is dying and so is my energy. I am including some links
of my work that might explain better... this is a long and tedious topic
with many turns and ideas. I feel like you are not quite getting it. 

Without reliving the trauma of the Guest thing. Yes. My disagreement with
Guest was allowing himself to be referred as NOT VALID - i.e. put down on
his book cover, disempowered and put in the victim role for sake of sales.
I see it this way - if someone had used the word nigger, fag or bitch in a
blurb, we'd never hear the end of it. However, people are so attached to
their concept of disability that this kind of thing goes unnoticed and then
defended (as you are here). Guest has every right to call himself and
invalid and let Mary Kerr and others to it. I have every right to challenge
and question that decision. Question: Would you defend the poet is it where
the case of a blurb with a racial slur?

I do not use the word SUFFERING FROM in terms of disability. Every
corporeal body is or will be full of various types of suffering. To say
someone "suffers from" cerebral palsy is degrading and makes a neurotical
difference into a disease - which it is not.

Girl poet-  I say that a big ironically. But I do consider myself a
feisty, sexy "girl" but my father is Lee Bartlett and, therefore,
genetically, I can talk circles around any man and probably drink them
under the table too.

Murat,

For the sake of humoring me, next time you bring up a poet with a
disability would you just say "they have" instead of "suffers from." Have
you read Beauty is a Verb? Have you heard of it? BTW, are you friends with
my good friend Fanny Howe? I saw a picture of you two on FB?

Jennifer,

I do not get what I am not getting. As I wrote, I did guess that your
objection to "invalid" is the suggestion of "not valid" embedded in the
word, when deconstructed. But why should Guest react to the word the way
you do? Do you mean that he was upset by that use, but kept his mouth shut
for monetary or other reasons. If so, you neither say or suggest that.

The word "nigger" has a history of abuse, violence, oppression around it.
In that sense, it has an objective aura of abuse around it. "Invalid"
(accent on the first syllable) has no such history. Are you saying that
that history is "buried," there, and you are criticizing Guest for his lack
of consciousness of this fact?

Ciao,

Murat

Jennifer,

That was a picture taken of us at The Poetry Project during a break. We
were discussing Charles Olson's prose. I was saying with its odd colloquial
inversions, particularly in a work like *The Mayan Letters*, Olson's prose
had a greater impact on me than his poetry. If I remember correctly, she
seemed to agree with me.

Come to think of it, "disability" has the suggestion of being "un-able"
embedded in it. But you do not object to it the way you object to
"invalid." What is the difference?

As your poem suggests, being disabled may sharpen one's insight as a poet
into the insanities of the "valid" world. In the hands of a poet, a
"weakness" may be transformed into strength. Dickinson say, "I play at
riches...." In "Questions of Accent" I make a similar argument. Tiresias's
blindness goes hand in hand with his prophesy. But that does not mean these
people do not suffer from their disabilities. I will keep using '"suffer
from disabilities."

Ciao,

Murat

The Harvest from a Field on Fire
Five Poems by Rachel Kubie

These poems stem from the Moral Monday protests in North Carolina this past
summer. Rachel Kubie is one of more than 940 arrestees who engaged in civil
disobedience at the legislative building in Raleigh. *

How to get Arrested
a preacher calls from the fields behind the senate
self-portrait with HB 589
In the Wild
how to keep a country

Rachel Kubie is a public reference librarian in Charlotte, NC. She attended the
Writing Seminars at Johns Hopkins "and had the good luck to study under Allen
Grossman there." She also has the MLS from Catholic University in DC. Her work
has appeared in Drunken Boat, Oyster Boy Review, Rattapallax, Rhino, Sou'wester,
and Potomac Review among other magazines, and in the anthologies Imperial
Messages: 100 Modern Parables (2nd ed.) and Final Harvest: Jewish Writing from
St. Louis.
      The five poems in The Harvest from a Field on Fire took shape as drafts in
the Tupelo Press online 30/30 project (during which poets attempt to post 30
drafts in 30 days).

Spread the word. Far and wide,

* House Bill 589, with massive changes to voting laws, was rushed through the
North Carolina legislature with almost no public notice in the late summer of
2013. It was introduced on the heels of the Shelby County v. Holder Supreme
Court case which struck down part of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, and it
enacts voting practices that the VRA would not have allowed, especially in
Southern states and counties where voter repression and intimidation had long
been common practice from the reconstruction to the civil rights movement.
      Among many changes, the new law allows vigilante poll watchers, and the
direct challenging of voters at the polls, requires strict forms of
identification beyond a voter registration card, shortens early voting, halts
programs to help older teens register for the first time, and places other
restrictions on qualifications and access to voting (including not allowing
polls to remain open for long lines during elections).
      The new law is being challenged by a number of groups, including the NAACP,
the League of Women Voters, and now the US Department of Justice. It introduces
the most severe restrictions on voting in the country.

Many thanks to Charles for this listserv, which proved an education in a
poetics and opportunity to meet new-to-me artists!  Many thanks to all
moderators, especially Amy (the only moderator during my stint here)!

No greater honor than a word from Groucho:
Hello, I must be going.
I cannot stay,
I came to say
I must be going.
I'm glad I came
but just the same
I must be going.

Showghi=92s prose poems leave the map behind and take us into a place =
where apparently simple everyday scenes turn, by a little=20
stretch of language, into the unpredictable und strange.
As Farhad Shoghi has said, he starts working from a word that he =
respects for its uncertainty and aims for
the exact spot (in landscape or thought) where the word can come back to =
itself, beyond fixed meaning or
purpose.

Farhad Showghi  was born in Prague in 1961 and grew up in Germany and =
Iran. He now lives as a
psychiatrist in Hamburg. Beside ENDE DES STADPLANS, our present book, he =
has published DIE

affiliation, these bibliographies, by nature must coincide with national
program requirements and professional regulations. Other lists could be
created, in the future, to carry those grassroots, community, collective,
vanity and other self-published venues to save any grassroots people too
far removed from the academy to have access to legitimate presses.

Poetics +++, last post from the wilderness, and thanks

To Poetics list, I wrote of broken symmetry, in the midst of a
discussion dreams are made of; there was much discussion of the
Poetics list, and In fumbling about the Poetics list, making a
decision:  the world is in the world. The Poetics list considers
hypertext, from which dreams are made of; there was much talk of
the Poetics list, and In fumbling about the Poetics list, making
a decision that the world is, after all, the world, the world is
in the world. Dear Poetics list, I am impaled by culture,
willingly take center stage, the world is in the world.

The Poetics List is no longer active. Email delivery has been discontinued. Web archives will remain.

It has been over ten years since I left Buffalo; it is no longer viable for me
to continue to sponsor this list. So, as of today, the Poetics List has been
discontinued. We are maintaing and hope to improve, the list archive.

The Poetics List EPC page will continue to have current information on the
archive:
http://epc.buffalo.edu/poetics/poeticslist.html

And, as the old Poetics List has ended, a new one is beginning. Francesco Levato
of the Chicago School of Poetics has started the Poetics List 2.0 -- which has
many features not possible to offer via the Liserv format:
<<<http://poeticslist.chicagoschoolofpoetics.com/>>>

*********

I started the Poetics List in late 1993, just after I came to Buffalo and
co-founded the Poetics Program and a little while before the founding of the
Electronic Poetry Center. When the list began, a email-based discussion group
was a radically new format. There was no web interface and no way to filter
messages. Emails were read and written via on-line ascii systems. During the
first six years of the list, a deep and wide ranging discussion developed among
the few hundred of us actively participating. I asked that the list address not
be publicized so that we could keep the discussion to those with shared
interests and that the list not become a general interest poetry forum. Much of
the spirit of the early list was captured by Joel Kuszai, who edited Poetics@,
for which I wrote the introduction. This ROOF book is available free in as
epub, mobi, or pdf; or via Amazon. Or you can also explore the early Poetics
List archive  (1993-1996).
http://epc.buffalo.edu/poetics/poeticslist.html

The list was unmoderated until 1999. At that time, many of us involved in early
forms of social media were confronted by flaming, spam, and trolls -- before
having those words for them. While some people objected to our move to list
moderation, an unmoderated list ended up driving away or silencing people I
wanted to be part of our discussion while at the same time giving free reign to
those hostile to the list's basic orientation (which, regrettably, I was far too
slow to realize). A no-holds barred unmoderated offshoot of the Poetics List was
started but didn't last long. (I take up issues around editing the Poetics List
in an essay in "Electronic Pies in the Poetry Skies" in Attack of the Difficult
Poems <http://www.electronicbookreview.com/thread/technocapitalism/poetic>.)

In any case, the care free days of the early list were over before the new
Millenium opened its eyes. By that time, the list had become a rare open forum
for the discussion of, and exchange of information about, unconventional poetry
and poetics: you didn't have to be at a bar in New York or a cafe in San
Francisco, or to know anybody on a scene, or to be enrolled in a program: all
you needed to participate was an active interest.  So I was determined to keep
the thing afloat and with the help of a succession of list moderators, we did,
peaking at about 1500 subscribers, with many more readers via the web.

Like PennSound and the EPC, the Poetics List has been housed in a non-profit,
non-commercial space with no advertising, no snooping on reader's or posters'
web activity, and privacy of our subscriber email list. This building of
noncommercial web space has been a foundational principal for all three sites.
For many of the long-term participants of the Poetics List, it became a very
personal space of friendship and exchange, argument and disagreement, as well a
place to find or post information about new books and publications and web
links. Participants relied on the list for contact with those with shared
poetry interests and as a means of getting in touch with one another. It was a
life-line.

The advent of user-friendly blog sites provided welcome access for poets to
create new forums, key alternatives to what the list initially offered. In the
last several years, Facebook and Twitter have, for many of us, made Listserv
programs less significant.

Here is how I formulated the aims of the list, in consultation with Joel Kusai
and Chris Alexander, starting about 2000:

<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<
Our aim is to support, inform, and extend those directions in poetry that are
committed to innovations, renovations, and investigations of form and/or/as
content, to the questioning of received forms and styles, and to the creation
of the otherwise unimagined, untried, unexpected, improbable, and impossible.
While we recognize that other lists may sponsor other possibilities for
exchange, we request that those participating in this forum keep in mind the
specialized and focused nature of this project and respect our decision to
operate a moderated list. The Poetics List exists to support and encourage
divergent points of view on innovative forms of modern and contemporary poetry
and poetics, and we are committed to doing what is necessary to preserve this
space for such dialog.

Please note that this list is primarily concerned with discussions of poetry and
poetics. We strongly encourage subscribers to post information, including web
links, relating to publications (print and internet), reading series, and blogs
that they have coordinated, edited or published, or in which they appear. Such
announcements constitute a core function of this list. Brief reviews of poetry
events and publications (print or digital) are always welcome.

The Poetics List is not a forum for a general discussion of poetry or for the
exchange of poems. Queries for contact information, messages intended for just
a few subscribers, "flame" messages, and free-standing personal poems or
journal entries will, in general, not be forwarded to the list.

Also, please note that the Poetics List is not a "chat" list and we discourage
the posting of  very short messages intended for only a few subscribers.
Personal queries and off-topic submissions will not be posted.
