There was a great brouhaha about finding "new" ED poems in the letters
years back.  A bit like the fellow who set Thomas Wolf's purple prose
in broken lines and titling them "A Stone, A Leaf, A Door."Nothing new
there, but just throwing some of ED's prose poemesque letters in high
relief.

Lew Turco of The Book of Forms did a similar reworking.  In all these
cases the power of the language is all ED's and the gimmick is the
whosit poet who treats the text.  Jess

Dear Jim--

Thanks so much for your enthusiasm.
http://www.blazevox.org/index.php/Shop/Poetry/city-bird-selected-poems-1991-2009-by-millie-niss-edited-by-martha-deed-192/

As for Horse Fuck Rock --  I agree.  One of the funniest and certainly
the dirtiest piece Millie ever wrote.  And editors are scared-to-death
of it.  Not Geoffrey of Blazevox perhaps.  But I didn't include it,
because this is primarily a selection of Millie's poems.  HFR is rather
clearly fiction.  Not even of the "flash" variety (which is included).

I am continuing to send some of her work around, and am on the lookout
for a place for HFR to land.

All best,
Martha

My 2008 conceptual novel LOCAL COLOUR is now available online as a
downloadable PDF at Craig Dworkin's exceptional resource "eclipse":

http://derekbeaulieu.wordpress.com/2011/01/31/local-colour/

Local Colour is a page-by-page interpretation of Paul Auster=B9s 72=ADpage
novella Ghosts. Ghosts concerns itself with Blue, a private detective hired
by a mysterious character named White to transcribe the actions of Black, a
denizen of Brooklyn Heights. As Blue reports his findings, the reader
becomes more aware of the intricate relationship between Black and White,
and a tactile awareness of the role of colour spreads through the narrative=
.

 Local Colour removes the entirety of Auster=B9s text, leaving only chromatic
words=8Bproper nouns or not=8Bspread across the page as dollops of paint on a
palette. What remains is the written equivalent of ambient music=8Bwords whic=
h
are meant to seen but not read. The colours, through repetition, build a
suspense and crescendo which is loosened from traditional narrative into a
more pixellated construction.

Who was it that reduced SH to tears? Figuratively speaking, of course.
SH found violence in the wilderness of American literary history. Your
classmate found it in the seminar that you attended. Cameron sounds
like a very compassionate teacher.

=0ANorthwestern University Press: http://is.gd/4FMoM2=0A=0AIn much the same=
 way that photography forced painting to move in new directions, the advent=
 of the World Wide Web, with its proliferation of easily transferable and m=
anipulated text, forces us to think about writing, creativity, and the mate=
riality of language in new ways. In Against Expression, editors Craig Dwork=
in and Kenneth Goldsmith present the most innovative works responding to th=
e challenges posed by these developments. Charles Bernstein has described c=
onceptual poetry as "poetry pregnant with thought." Against Expression, the=
 premier anthology of conceptual writing, presents work that is by turns th=
oughtful, funny, provocative, and disturbing. Dworkin and Goldsmith, two of=
 the leading spokespersons and practitioners of conceptual writing, chart t=
he trajectory of the conceptual aesthetic from early precursors including S=
amuel Beckett and Marcel Duchamp to the most prominent of today's writers. =
Nearly all of the major avant-garde groups of the
 past century are represented here, including Dada, OuLiPo, L=3DA=3DN=3DG=
=3DU=3DA=3DG=3DE, and Flarf to name just a few, but all the writers are uni=
ted in their imaginative appropriation of found and generated texts and the=
ir exploration of nonexpressive language. Against Expression is a timely co=
llection and an invaluable resource for readers and writers alike.=0A=0AAut=

"With so many subjects represented =97 most everything has an article on
Wikipedia =97 the gender disparity often shows up in terms of emphasis. A
topic generally restricted to teenage girls, like friendship
bracelets<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friendship_bracelet>,
can seem short at four paragraphs *when compared with lengthy articles on
something boys might favor*, like, toy soldiers or baseball cards, whose
voluminous entry includes a detailed chronological history of the subject.
[Emphasis added.]

For anyone who doubts how deep these systemic problems run..

Yes, I read this too, and it was shocking.  But this is why Wikipedia is not
a reliable source for information.  In my experience, many of its articles
are written by zealous amateurs or zealous zealots.  In my area of expertise
[which is Vedic and Sanskrit] most of the articles have been repeatedly
highjacked by right-wing Hindu fundamentalists.

The fact that women contributors to Wikipedia amount to as little as 13%
indicates that men are far more zealous zealots that women are.  So, yes, if
we want to fix this, all of us feminists should become more zealous than the
real hardcore zealots.  Shout louder, I guess, is how Wikipedia works.

=A0Hi all,

I'm working on expanding a cannon centered around....well, the term
that I'm deliberately avoiding here is Beat Writers--(since women were
decidedly excluded from direct recognition)

But what if we create a cannon around the techniques. Are there any
post-WWII women writers that used some of the techniques discussed in
Howl?

--who dreamt and made incarnate gaps in Time & Space through images
juxtaposed, and trapped the archangel of the soulbetween 2 visual
images and joined the elemental verbs and set the noun and dash of
consciousness together jumping with sensation of Pater Omnipotens
Aeterna Deus

--to recreate the syntax and measure of poor human prose and stand
before you speechless and intelligent and shaking with shame, rejected
yet confessing out the soul to conform to the rhythm of thought in his
naked and endless head,

They may have come slightly earlier or slightly later...maybe they
didn't live in San Francisco or New York. Maybe they didn't graduate
from Harvard or Columbia...

But they'd have spoken about Dharma perhaps? Mabe Whitman and Blake were he=
roes?

Who would the beats have admired had they not been so full of their
own prejudices?

Or am I asking the wrong questions?

How would you reformulate this cannon? I know there's the book Women
Beat Poets but that's not quite what I'm after...

Thanks for your help.

Bone Bouquet seeks to publish the best new writing by female poets,
from artists both established and emerging. We are especially
interested in work that is unpredictable, poems that have both sass
and authority. We look for poetry, interviews, craft essays, and
reviews of chapbooks/books of poetry (please limit reviews to those
that address books published in the last two years) as well as visual
art for our covers. Simultaneous submissions are fine, as long as we
are notified when work is accepted elsewhere. Bone Bouquet only
accepts previously unpublished work; we request first electronic
rights, and would like to archive your work on the site. Please note
that your work first appeared in Bone Bouquet if it is reprinted
elsewhere on the web or in print.

The best way to get a sense of what kind of work we value is to read
previous issues, indeed, to buy a copy of issue 2.1, which contains
work by Arielle Greenberg, Jennifer Firestone, and others.

We look forward to reading your work!

All best,

In I IS AN OTHER, James Geary shows how every aspect of our lives, from th=
e power of advertisements to the housing bubble bust to President Obama=E2=
=80=99s political rhetoric, is molded by metaphor.
=20
For lovers of language and fans of Blink and Freakonomics, James Geary=E2=
=80=99s I IS AN OTHER: The Secret Life of Metaphor and How It Shapes the=
 Way We See the World (Harper/ HarperCollins Publishers; $19.99/$25.99 Can=
; ISBN 13: 9780061710285; on-sale 2/8/2011) offers a fascinating look at=
 metaphors and their influence in every aspect of our lives, from art to=
 medicine, psychology to the stock market. Witty, persuasive, and original=
, I is an Other showcases how a simple way with words, which in the past=
 was considered only a tool for poets, is really a driving force in our so=
ciety.
=20
We utter about one metaphor for every 10 to 25 words, or about six metapho=
rs a minute. =E2=80=9CIt is the East, and Juliet is the sun!=E2=80=9D is=
 one of Shakespeare=E2=80=99s most famous lines and one of the most well=
 known metaphors in literature. But metaphor is much more than a mere lite=
rary device employed by love-struck poets when they refer to their girlfri=
ends as interstellar masses of incandescent gas. In this fascinating and=
 entertaining book, Geary demonstrates how metaphor affects financial deci=
sion-making, how metaphor lurks behind effective advertisements, how metap=
hor inspires learning and discovery, and how metaphor can be used as a too=
l to achieve emotional insight and psychological change.
=20
The book=E2=80=99s unusual title comes from 19th-century French poet Arthu=
r Rimbaud, who believed that metaphor=E2=80=94the equation of one thing wi=
th another, completely different thing, of I with an other=E2=80=94was the=
 basis not just of poetry but of all creative thought.
=20
In I Is an Other, Geary takes readers from Aristotle=E2=80=99s investigati=
on of metaphor right up to the latest neuroscientific insights into how me=
taphor works in the brain. Along the way, he demonstrates how new research=
 in the social and cognitive sciences makes it increasingly plain that met=
aphor influences our attitudes, beliefs, and actions in surprising, hidden=
, and often oddball ways. He details how metaphor has finally leapt off th=
e page and landed with a mighty splash right in the middle of our stream=
 of consciousness.
=20
James Geary is the author of the New York Times bestseller The World in a=
 Phrase and Geary=E2=80=99s Guide to the World=E2=80=99s Great Aphorists,=
 both of which celebrate the witty and thought-provoking art of the aphori=
sm. Geary is editor of Ode, a magazine about optimism and positive news,=
 and a regular contributor to Popular Science. He is the former editor of=
 the European edition of Time, based in London.=20

 http://www.ted.com/talks/james_geary_metaphorically_speaking.html. =20
James Geary can discuss:=20
=C2=B7 Why metaphors (in the form of visual imagery) are crucial to the cr=
eation of memorable ads and successful brands
=C2=B7 How metaphors are used in financial commentary and how they can dra=
matically affect personal financial decisions
=C2=B7 The essential role of metaphorical thinking in business innovation=
=20
=C2=B7 What metaphor tells us about everything from motivating others to=
 navigating office politics
=C2=B7 How metaphor can be used to form public opinion and shape political=
 debate
=C2=B7 What life is like without metaphor, as experienced by some people=
 with autism spectrum disorders, who have difficulty using and understandi=
ng figurative language=20
=20
I IS AN OTHER will open your eyes to the secret life of metaphor and its=
 role in swinging elections, moving markets, and powerfully influencing da=
ily life. I hope you will consider it for features and reviews and its aut=
hor for interviews. I look forward to speaking with you soon.

I think that the characterization of Wikipedia editors as zealots is =
unfair. Enthusiasts? Volunteeers? Certainly some topics are "hijacked."

Is that word unfortunate or intentional?

Perhaps it's that some topics are prone to be "hijacked" by "zealots"? =
And that the fault is not the medium? Maybe the problem of zealotry is a =
side-effect of the openness? Is it necessary to assume that openness is =
an invitation to shout and bully?

The absence of obvious zealots in the Encyclopedia Britannica, or the =
classroom, or the museum, is no guarantee that that a single, =
authoritarian view does not rule the content.

Maybe shouting and competition is better than silence, or the muted =
tones of arranged consent?

I do not intend to hijack the gender issue.

I think the best solution is for more women to work on Wikipedia.

Is it possible to argue that women are making more pragmatic investments =
of energy? In other forms of publication? Is digested knowledge and =
authority less palatable to women? (I mean, aside from the fact that =
they have been and continue to be often beaten back from those modes?)

Is there a way to focus on ability and possibility rather than =
disability.

(I have to admit part of my argument here is deriving from my urge to =
defend Susan Howe in another thread of conversation.)

ARTHUR ECHO by CAConrad & Thom Donovan

A (Soma)tic collaboration, ARTHUR ECHO documents a Winter 2009 day
Conrad and Donovan spent listening to cellist Arthur Russell's WORLD OF
ECHO on a twelve-hour loop in a five-story Philadelphia house. This
chapbook appropriately inhabits the pop music tradition of the split
single, as both poets tune into Russell's masterpiece to generate
separate sets of notes on occult topics like angel milk & rock salt, the
nutritive body, ecophenomenology, and lyric poetry. A unique tribute to
Russell that conjures a reverberant portrait of close-listening and
vital friendship from perceptual flux.

 Wow, you've got it figured out, and so fast!  It's always women's fault, ain't
it?  It's never about the conditions, the posting climate, or anything more
complex than just:  it's your fault if you don't join in!   Not, why aren't
women willing to assert their opinions in public?  Is there something going on
in the structure, the people participating, etc.  Must just be some innate
glitch in the female matrix - nothing to do with reception, how women's ideas
are received, etc.  --As we can see through some of the wonderful hostility
expressed through the years in the archives of this very listserv!

ED suffered from serious problems with her vision for years--that's one
useful point to keep in mind when considering "non-sexist"
transcriptions of her texts.  She also apparently sometimes wrote in the
near dark--and there is indeed a draft of a poem with lines that run off
the page.

Most of the poems were worksheets, which explains the word lists included
with the poems.  You'll find something similar in the manuscripts of
other poets: gaps and possible insertions. Though the idea of an
open-ended, interactive poem is an intriguing one, and ED was certainly
bright enough to have invented a poetics that would have allowed it,
given the times in which she wrote and her own habits of reading and
writing, I don't believe that was her intention.

Thomas Johnson's clarifications of Ed's poems allowed scholarship,
including Howe's, to proceed.  Up to the Johnson text, there were
"correct" versions coming from the Vinnie/Austin Dickinson/Todd
manuscripts vs. the Susan Gilbert & daughter manuscripts side of the war
between the houses.  (The whole fascinating story is laid out in the
book Ancestors' Brocades.)  Far from being a sexist projecting maleness
on female texts, Johnson made possible the serious Dickinson scholarship
that only really began in the 1960's.

Howe did a service, by directing us back to the materiality of
Dickinson's texts.  That's important, but suggesting that the politics
of gender had anything to do with Johnson's  edition is hard to
justify.  The point is--one has to begin to begin--and Johnson did just
that.  I think everyone involved in Dickinson scholarship owes Johnson a
great deal because without his collecting and clarifying the corpus, the
full range of Ed's subject matter and the breath-taking sweep of her
mind had not been apparent.

Those Marquette professors were really outraged by Howe's
impressionistic interpretations of HER Emily Dickinson, as well as by
the gender stuff and Thomas Johnson. I understood their outrage. I like
Howe's poetry, but I think her take on Dickinson  allows us to turn
away from the text itself and see what's not really there--and that--in
Cameron's seminar at Johns Hopkins--was something this amazing mind did
not allow us to do.  She said that that mode of non-dealing with the
text--that impressionistic mode--was what had plagued ED's work up to
the start of the 1960's. Once again take a look at Lyric Time is an
amazing book.

From what I've read of Susan Howe's poetry--I don't see any
similarities between her lapidary, "flat" style and ED's
luminosities.  Lorine Niedecker has also be called a 20th century Emily
Dickinson and outside of the fact that she was a she and wrote shorter
poems and wrote about nature, her "flat" style seems closer to Stephen
Crane's "pills" than ED's poems.

The one thing for certain is Howe's transcriptions are more exact / precise / accurate / faithful representations of ED's actual notebook than any I've seen.  Based on facsimile, of course.  And from here we're off and running with the charge of sexism, the manner in which the little leaves have been treated, on lock down, utterly transfigured, obliterated white space dashes cross outs circles whatnot.

Sorry if it was not clear, it was my seminar mate who was driven to tears
by Cameron--not Susan Howe.  The Hopkins seminar started out "standing
room only" and by the end was reduced to a handful of stalwarts.  I
loved it.  Jess

In much the same way that photography forced painting to move in new dir=
ections, the advent of the World Wide Web, with its proliferation of eas=
ily transferable and manipulated text, forces us to think about writing,=
 creativity, and the materiality of language in new ways. In Against Exp=
ression, editors Craig Dworkin and Kenneth Goldsmith present the most in=
novative works responding to the challenges posed by these developments.=
 Charles Bernstein has described conceptual poetry as "poetry pregnant w=
ith thought." Against Expression, the premier anthology of conceptual wr=
iting, presents work that is by turns thoughtful, funny, provocative, an=
d disturbing. Dworkin and Goldsmith, two of the leading spokespersons an=
d practitioners of conceptual writing, chart the trajectory of the conce=
ptual aesthetic from early precursors including Samuel Beckett and Marce=
l Duchamp to the most prominent of today's writers. Nearly all of the ma=
jor avant-garde groups of the
 past century are represented here, including Dada, OuLiPo, L=3DA=3DN=3D=
G=3DU=3DA=3DG=3DE, and Flarf to name just a few, but all the writers are=
 united in their imaginative appropriation of found and generated texts =

Bravely stated, Amy.  The hostility is there.  So we stay off line.  We
don't answer list serves.  We don't get promotions.  We don't TRY to
compete.  We don't expect publication, really.   We know when it's not "our
game."  Every attempt to overcome -- is a huge effort to overcome.

We get tired.

Is this a world of our own making?  Perhaps.  But until EVERYONE addresses
the politics, women will be more valued as baby-makers and not text-makers.
We will continue to live in our own shadows (with a few brave exceptions).
We will continue to fight every step -- for what should be obvious: equal
consideration and full artist / thinking-being humanity.

It continues to be an astounding phenomena, this subtle and not-so-subtle
prejudice well into the 21st century (only, really, a number). In some ways,
it appears to be getting worse out there in this decade for women.  The
consciousness is:  oh, we've already solved that problem.  So, let's not
seek out the women writers and the women's perspectives into our magazines.
After all, that is old 70's stuff.
And we who keep raising the issues:  we are the "whiners."

Thanks for giving me fodder for my introduction tonight to my graduate
seminar in Women's Experimental Poetics.  I hate that we have to have these
classes, by the way, that separate the women from the Boys.  And yet I teach
them.  The world, contrary to popular expectation, is not yet remade ... in
a supposedly post-feminist society.

I look forward to the hostility provoked for having expressed my opinions in
the matter.

Laura

I'd love to know more about, guesses even, about Emily Dickinson's own
potential library. What would have constituted the 'trivia' for her? We
already have a direction with Martha Werner's book on the ephemeral poems
and 'scatters.' I'm curious though about the books and essays that her
various interlocutors may have brought her way. I wonder if someone here has
a find they'd like to share.

... one thing I thought interesting was how Dickinson wrote on scraps of
paper... adrift in paper seemingly (even if kept in drawers and pockets of
her dress) from which she perhaps assembled poems... and descriptions of
Olson's house near the end of his life (especially) and the last Maximus

Of course there are the obvious contemporary poet/dharma
practitioners--Diane diPrima, Joanne Kyger, then Anne Waldman, Patti Smith
and  Barbara Moraff--all Buddhist practitioners.  Then, there are legions of
poets (both men and women)  who studied with Allen over the years at Naropa,
Brooklyn College and elsewhere where they were introduced to his pedagogy.
Personally, I think its a great idea to move beyond the Beat boundaries and
focus on women poets practicing the dharma who were influenced by him since
Ginsberg's progression as a dharma practitiioner and teacher at the Jack
Kerouac School which he co-founded with Anne Waldman went beyond earlier
'Beat' limitations. He mentored a lot of men AND women poets. I count myself
among his many students both in the dharma and poetics during the years I
knew him at Naropa (1983-89) and then in his office as an employee from
1989-1994.

There are many links online to his dharma Poetics teaching materials
including  his Mind Writing Slogans and other handouts. The Mind Writing
Slogans were developed out of his more worldly Cosmopolitan Greetings to
embody the traditional Buddhist tripartite logic of ground, path and
fruition. As Patrick notes many women were influenced or taught by him who
may not necessarily be dharma practitioners.

Years ago a friend slipped me a cassette of a young Om Khalsoum recorded li=
ve in what sounds like a cafe full of appreciative audience members - I was=
 told that members of her family provided the musical accompaniment.

I've never heard Khaltsoum sound so secular and sexy. The sound quality of =
the recording isn't that great, but who cares?  Her voice is youthful and e=
xquisite.

I made a cd of it (about 38 minutes long) and managed to create a .wav file=
 - it's pretty large, but it's available for the downloading here:

The Turkish poet Orhan Veli's last poem was found on a paper wrapped around
his toothbrush. He died of brain hemorrhage at the age of 33.

The Dickinson family's library is at Harvard's Houghton Library, and
it's now being digitized, complete with editorial notes calling
attention to things like the books that Dickinson cut up for
illustrations that she sewed into her letters with tiny loops of pink
thread.

And thanks to Jesse Glass for his tribute to Thomas H. Johnson. It's
true that a Johnson text brought Sharon Cameron to grief at one point in
_Lyric Time_, where her densely argued discussion of what looks like a
break in "I tie my hat, I crease my shawl" (Johnson's poem no. 443) is
based entirely on a transcription error. As R. W. Franklin had already
demonstrated by the time Cameron wrote, J443 looks as if it breaks in
the middle because it consists of the end of one poem attached to the
beginning of another. Still, somebody had to produce the first real
edition of Dickinson, and that somebody was Johnson.

While we're at it (and as long as we're talking about women and
Wikipedia), let's also remember Johnson's collaborator Theodora Ward,
who contributed the Johnson edition's extremely useful subject index.
The 1998 Franklin edition supersedes Johnson's, but because it's
strictly an exercise in textual scholarship it doesn't even have a
subject index. Johnson and Ward never forgot that the poems are poems.

I discuss Todd-Higginson, Bianchi, Johnson, and Franklin in my
"Bibliographical Essay," in _A Historical Guide to Emily Dickinson_, ed.
Vivian R. Pollak (Oxford University Press, 2004). Shameless commercial:
every book in Oxford's Historical Guide series has a chapter boringly
titled "Bibliographical Essay," but Dickinson's publication history is
not just interesting but luridly, soap-operatically interesting. Lyndall
Gordon's new biography of Dickinson, _Lives Like Loaded Guns_ (Viking,
2010), brings the history up to date with the story of how the
manuscripts got to Harvard, but unfortunately this book can't be relied
on. I mention some reasons on my blog at

Two provocative essays from the current issue of *Chicago Review*, "55:3/4:
Essays for Robert von Hallberg," are now viewable online: Keith
Tuma's "After the Bubble" and Peter O'Leary's "Apocalypticism: A Way Forward
for Poetry." In very different ways, these essays address the disappearance
of the American avant-garde and its relation to program culture. We're
interested in hearing what readers think of these essays, so drop us a
letter (by email or mail mail) for possible inclusion in the upcoming
issue.

Also, for a limited time, subscribe for one year ($25 in the US) and receive
the current issue for free. Your first paid issue is in production now and
due out in the spring: "56:1, New Italian Writing," a survey of exciting
work by young Italian poets, critics, and fiction writers. Please mention
this offer in the "Comments" section of the online order form.

thanks so much for this Camille.

In 1987 Sianed Jones and myself traveled in the oases of the Western Sahara
with violin and voice and her terrific voice, playing in cafes by night and
being taught Om Khalsoum tunes by day to playback in the evenings . . i've
loved the sinew of these tunes . . much like the shifting sands in the
desert (i know that a pathetic way of describing it but travel those roads
and you will understand how it works . . one day the road has to go this way
because of the sands and another day another route must be taken because the
sands have moved). I'd recommend Dimi Mint Abba from Mauritania and Fanta
Damba from Mali along similar lines. But Om Khalsoum is surely the
progenitor and on later excursions her band gets downright funky!

Glad to hear that Irish women poets are out there fighting hard and making
waves (being part Irish myself, if an American hybrid version).

But please note that women are NOT the "fairer sex."  Never have been, never
will be.  Think about the assumptions such a phrase implies.  Does the "fair
sex" write poetry?  What kind?  Does "it" have a voice?  "Fair" -- according
to whom, whose value, whose gaze?

I've enjoyed Oum Khalsoum for more than 30 years. I didn't know this
recording. So thanks very much for making it available. To my ear it sounds
middle period (1940s?) but I could be completely wrong.

thanks so much for this Camille.

In 1987 Sianed Jones and myself traveled in the oases of the Western Sahara
with violin and voice and her terrific voice, playing in cafes by night and
being taught Om Khalsoum tunes by day to playback in the evenings . . i've
loved the sinew of these tunes . . much like the shifting sands in the
desert (i know that a pathetic way of describing it but travel those roads
and you will understand how it works . . one day the road has to go this way
because of the sands and another day another route must be taken because the
sands have moved). I'd recommend Dimi Mint Abba from Mauritania and Fanta
Damba from Mali along similar lines. But Om Khalsoum is surely the
progenitor and on later excursions her band gets downright funky!

Well sure, Jonathan, this is what scholarship is all about. Good that
the mistake was uncovered and that we're brought that much closer to an
understanding of ED's work. Surely what Johnson and Cameron did was
provisional scholarship of the 1950's and 1980's--It appears that you
have surpassed both. I salute you. Jess

Hi Jared,

Points more than understood.

First I think it's important to say that ANY discussion about ED on this
list is a good one. Her work is vital for all of us.  My experience of
S. Cameron's class was necessary for me, in retrospect, because it
taught me to read a text closely and not to rely on history, biography,
politics or my own imagination for an answer.  We identified the
riddling structure of some of ED's poems, her startling use of the
English Metaphysicals and her use of capitalization to create
"near"-metaphor.  But more than that, Cameron took me to places in
ED's work that I did not suspect existed and showed me how truly
original she is.  She showed me the profound questioning of science and
religion that went on in her work, the presence-in-absence of Dickinson
most powerful poems, and the use of violent and explosive images.  In
addition, Cameron provided a closely-reasoned context for ED's work, as
well as a tremendous range of resources for the study of ED's poetry
and prose.  She absolutely knew her stuff and she was absolutely keen to
impart it sometimes in a direct manner that was hard for some students
to take.  The boundaries were clear.  We were not allowed to bring
projective verse into the seminar, or visual poetry, or to interpret the
dots, lines, and other methods of punctuation as marks that might direct
one to "sing" a Dickinson text, or to point to word lists and call
them clouds or integral parts of the performance of the poem (as
interesting as this idea may be--Richard Howard pointed this out in
another class in another context).  Johnson was not deified in the
seminar, but he was seen exactly for what he was--a collector of all the
texts then extant, and someone who provided a clear place to start.

Dickinson published what--5 poems in her life time--maybe 7, but I think
it's 5--and her work was edited and edited badly by Mabel Loomis Todd
and Susan Gilbert Dickinson's side of the war between the houses.
These were the people who truly tried to intervene and "rewrite"
Dickinson--not Johnson. These editings continued in the anthologies that
appeared through the 1950's and even into the 60's.  It wasn't until
Johnson collected all of the poems that we began to get a real picture
of Dickinson and the range of her work.  Up to then, of course, the
dozen famous poems appeared in their "corrected" version along with a
healthy dose of the Myth of Emily Dickinson.

My question is, before Johnson and his "sexist" agenda (!), ED's work
was being handled with a lot less textual care, and was distorted by
those men and women who wished to glorify the myth of ED at the expense
of any real understanding of her work.

If one did not attempt to clarify the problematic handwriting, the
possible sequences in the fascicles, the punctuation, which probably had
more to do with bad eyesight than anything else, how could one begin to
understand anything of Dickinson and do what scholarship is supposed to
do: bring us closer to an appreciation and an understanding of the
author's work.

If one lacks the ability to read a text with precision, then photographs
of problematic handwriting will not help that person at all. ED's work
is extremely difficult even with provisional clarifications of text.

This is the question I asked Susan Howe herself: How does one present a
"non-sexist" (in her words) non-interventionist ED?  It seems to me
that the only way we could is by presenting photographs of the texts as
they are and refraining from all commentary.

But here's my point: I believe that Susan Howe presents the verso of the
same old Emily Dickinson myth: she allows those who do not wish to come
to grips with the work itself to turn away in the name of something
else.  Instead of the giddy old spinster with the brilliant mind who
dresses all in white and writes so well about nature and death, we have
the "poet" held back by family, friends, males, society, who leaves
behind texts that should be seen for themselves and for themselves only
and in exactly the condition in which they were left, maugre bad
eyesight and writing in the dark, and that somehow this will allow us to
see word clouds and almost anything else we want to retrospectively see
in the manuscripts of that poet and consider them part of "my" Emily
Dickinson and no one else'.  This was exactly the case before
Johnson's edition and it effectively closes down ED to anything but
subjective "easy" appreciations of the work, which means that most
sympathetic readers will wave a hand and pass by.

While Jesse makes some very reasonable points=2C it seems to me that Jared =
does as well.  In particular=2C while Johnson's scholarship is important (a=
s I think everyone would acknowledge=2C including Susan Howe)=2C the questi=
on remains as to what degree the extant text is the editor's and to what de=
gree the poet's.  This is a valid question=2C Jesse=2C even if you don't fi=
nd Howe's analysis persuasive (and I'm not saying it's definitive=2C though=
 surely you wouldn't say that Johnson's is either=2C right?).=20

This is also a valid question of most poets' work=97 what is the definitive=
 text?=97 but in Dickinson's case the question is important because there w=
as never a published body of work approved by the poet herself.  And also=
=2C because of the gender dynamics (the male editor and the unpublished=2C =
"naive" female poet=2C etc.=2C etc.)  So=2C even if you find Howe's argumen=
t lacking=97 and I am certainly open to considering your position on that=
=97 I wonder about your evident opposition to Howe.  You note that your pro=
fessors at the time were appalled (I forget if that's your exact word=2C bu=
t I think it's close enough.)  But you no longer are a student=2C and even =
if your professors didn't like Howe's work that doesn't prove it has no val=
idity.  (Such an argument would be a logical fallacy called Appeal to Autho=
rity.)  Of course=2C I don't think that's the argument you're making.  You'=
re much too smart for that.  And I hope we can genuinely & honestly agree t=
o disagree about this=97 because I don't agree with you=2C but I respect yo=
ur opinion.  From the point of view of scholarship (much less poesis)=2C it=
 seems more important to raise intelligent questions than to have all the a=
nswers already laid out in order.  (Or perhaps you disagree with that too?)

From my curiosity alone=2C I definitely side with Howe=97 and I hope that y=
ou can respect my dissenting opinion=2C even though I doubt you will agree.

In friendship=2C

I do want to get my hands on Cameron's book.  Especially re "no projective.=

e=2C which doesn't really interest me=2C much would seem to be a function o=
f circumstance rather than intent.  What interests me more is the translati=
on / transcription of the original leaves.  As you say=2C mere photos of th=
e pages won't suffice.  So none of this here or before is / was meant to do=
wnplay the serious textual scholarship of Johnsons=2C Franklins=2C Morses e=
t al.  Imagine "our" ED without them...

I'm looking here at some photocopies of Howe's unpublished typographic tran=

I hope the gaps and whatnot come through intact over the e-waves=2C though =
they perhaps won't -- I've also eliminated the dizzying identifying materia=

Howe: "I have tried to match the poems in type=2C as nearly as possible=2C =
to the Franklin edition of The Manuscript Books. In translating Dickinson's=
 handwriting into type I have not followed standard typesetting conventions=
. I have paid attention to space between handwritten words. I have broken t=
he lines exactly as she broke them. I have
 tried to match the spacing between words in the lists at the end of=20
poems. I have not been able to pay attention to spaces between letters. I
 think that in the later poetry such spacing is a part of the meaning.=20
Dickinson's frequent use of the dash was noted in the Johnson edition=2C=20
but he regularized these marks. I know that in some books printed during
 the nineteenth century=2C variant readings were sometimes supplied at the
 end of a page=2C and they were marked by a sort of cross. The History of N=
ew England from 1630 to 1649=2C
 by John Winthrop=2C edited by James Savage=2C and published in Boston in=20
1826=2C is a good example of such practice=3B however=2C if there were more=
=20
than two words=2C a number was used for the second one=2C and in other book=
s
 the number of crosses increased for each word. Emily Dickinson had=20
enough humor to read these variants as found poems. She was her own=20
publisher and could do as she liked with her texts. These were the days=20
of Edward Lear and Lewis Carroll=3B liberties were taken in print..."

Thanks, Jess, but agh no! All I did in that little chapter was write a
history of the scholarship and criticism done by others.

As long as I'm being modest, though, let me update the chapter by saying
that I now appreciate Franklin's edition a lot more than I used to. The
big difference between the Johnson edition and the Franklin edition is
in the chronology of the poems, and I was slow to understand how
important that is. Franklin's groupings of the poems really let you see
Dickinson's mind in action -- encountering Emerson in one
chronologically related group of poems, for instance, or developing her
"I've got plenty o' nothin'" theme in another.

And in the classroom I solve the problem of Franklin's missing subject
index by distributing a pair of xeroxes: the subject index from the
Johnson edition and the Johnson-number-to-Franklin-number conversion
table from the Franklin edition (the 3-volume variorum only,
unfortunately). I've posted a PDF of that reading aid under "Class
material" on my web page at http://jonathanmorse.net .

Those who were at the last Soundeye festival in Cork may like to know that
Geoffrey Squires' *Abstract Lyrics*, which he read there, is now available
as an ebook at www.shearsman.com

SoundEye 2011 will be the fifteenth anniversary of the festival, so it=92s
going to be a good one. It will take place in Cork, Ireland on the 13th

More details as we get things settled.

Thanks for this, Mark.  The Marquette professors were not MY professors!
:-)  Howe came to Milwaukee to give a presentation of her Emily
Dickinson at Marquette.

Dr. Cameron of JHU knew nothing of Susan Howe's work at the time, and
maybe still doesn't.  Her Lyric Time is a fine, thought-provoking book.
 Please take a look at it, Mark.

I read Susan Howe's book when it first came out and had a chance to talk
to her about her ideas all those many years ago in Milwaukee.

Jared did a pretty good job of describing the main idea of the book--I
guess those were his "points".

I describe my "point" in another e-mail, but I think you could help
yourself out of your confusion by reading Cameron's book and then
taking a look at Susan Howe's book.

Every best wish,

Jesse

>While Jesse makes some very reasonable points, it seems to me that Jared does as well.  In particular, while Johnson's scholarship is important (as I think everyone would acknowledge, including Susan Howe), the question remains as to what degree the extant text is the editor's and to what degree the poet's.  This is a valid question, Jesse, even if you don't find Howe's analysis persuasive (and I'm not saying it's definitive, though surely you wouldn't say that Johnson's is either, right?).
>
>This is also a valid question of most poets' work&#65533; what is the definitive text?&#65533; but in Dickinson's case the question is important because there was never a published body of work approved by the poet herself.  And also, because of the gender dynamics (the male editor and the unpublished, "naive" female poet, etc., etc.)  So, even if you find Howe's argument lacking&#65533; and I am certainly open to considering your position on that&#65533; I wonder about your evident opposition to Howe.  You note that your professors at the time were appalled (I forget if that's your exact word, but I think it's close enough.)  But you no longer are a student, and even if your professors didn't like Howe's work that doesn't prove it has no validity.  (Such an argument would be a logical fallacy called Appeal to Authority.)  Of course, I don't think that's the argument you're making.  You're much too smart for that.  And I hope we can genuinely & honestly agree to disagree abo
 ut this&#65533; because I don't agree with you, but I respect your opinion.  From the point of view of scholarship (much less poesis), it seems more important to raise intelligent questions than to have all the answers already laid out in order.  (Or perhaps you disagree with that too?)

HISTORIC DIARY (poems)
Tony Trigilio
BlazeVOX [books], 2011

"Tony Trigilio's HISTORIC DIARY (named after Lee Harvey Oswald's account
of his time in the Soviet Union) excavates the nightmarish record of the
first Kennedy assassination, its auguries and aftermath, with a blue
fury and an obsessive zeal that border on the Talmudic. What he finds
there goes beyond chilling to a pure-product-of-America craziness that
makes me tremble for my country. 'I am waiting // for someone to / ride
me, the / locomotive of history,' Trigilio writes, and his ticket beyond
the grave takes us, willy-nilly, on this scarifying, brilliant, and
disturbing ride."

--Rachel Loden

"'Hegel makes no sense when everyone is looking at you,' confides the
protagonist of Tony Trigilio's HISTORIC DIARY, and he's speaking from
experience.  In this extraordinary work of imaginative reconstruction,
Trigilio assembles a postmodernist Warren Commission Report from
archival research, obituaries, interviews, and historical broadcasts
surrounding the assassination of John F. Kennedy, only to discover, in
the chaos of evidence, rumor, and falsehood, that no dialectical method
can offer his speaker an escape from the prison house of paranoia.  By
composing what Ezra Pound would have called 'a poem including history'
from this harrowing litany of Cold War casualties, however, he offers
his reader the stark consolation of an elegy for the truth itself: 'This
is the story of what never happened, written ahead of time.'"

--Srikanth Reddy

"Richly varied and deeply brave, HISTORIC DIARY is both a page-turner
that takes you into remote corners of the Kennedy assassination
controversy, and a bold postmodernist collage of poetic styles, voices,
and forms. This fine book will keep you rereading and reworking the
fragments the poet offers until you are left with not only an oblique
but fascinating portrait of Lee Harvey Oswald and the times in which he
lived, but also a challenging poetic exploration of the nature of
history itself."

--Martha Collins

Adam Fieled's Equations is in print now from Blue & Yellow Dog Press:

http://www.lulu.com/product/paperback/equations/14600597

"A recession has hit America at such an angle that everything has been called
into question. The thoughtlessness of fin de siecle America has been replaced by
mistrust, envy, and defensiveness. In this atmosphere, new imperatives emerge:
to sort out wheat from chaff, gold from dross, truth from fiction. These
imperatives are enacted in solitude, as the poet takes a scalpel to the body of
his experiences. Adam Fieled's Equations is a vivid manifestation of a new,
scrupulous American consciousness. It is the effort of a poet to elevate the
carnal with intellect, and to create a memorable chiasmus between them. The
frigidity of post-modern verse is replaced by a new romanticism, that is not
romantic. That is the central endeavor here, and it is performed with panache."

Jared,

How to you know "presuming to lead" is not "presuming to God"?

Well, there's already a problem, Jared, and that's with the dashes.
Dickinson's dashes are one of the most difficult aspects of her mss.
Sometimes they "float" above the gap, sometimes "sink" below.
Sometimes they're slanting like accent marks, sometimes they're dots
of various sizes.  (A Bit like Blackburn's floating periods.)  They
take other forms too--length is variable as well.  Here's the question:
what are we to make of them in any transcription?  Thomas Johnson
regularized them into the now familiar dash, but shouldn't Susan Howe
and anyone following after give the most accurate representation of the
so-called dashes?

And shouldn't they mean something too?  I mean, if the word lists are to
be included, then certainly this aspect of Dickinson should not be
ignored. Or should it?

 New Year, New Titles, New
Directions<http://furniturepressbooks.com/2011/02/09/new-year-new-titles-ne=
w-directions/>

First we have to congratulate the winner of the 2010 Furniture Press Poetry
Prize, Joshua Ware, whose manuscript *Homage to Homage to Homage to
Creeley*was chosen by the incomparable crypto-Hellenist, Magus
Magnus <http://furniturepressbooks.com/books/magnuspride/>, out of a
stunning variety of noteworthy submissions. We=92re proud (and honored!) to
publish the collection later this year, which will be available by the firs=
t
of the Cruellest Month.

In the next year, Furniture Press Books will also publish a variety of both
playful and challenging texts, including Elizabeth Savage=92s *Grammar*, a
tripped up nursery of shifting rhymes, rhythms and intricate lyrics,
and Ryan Eckes=92 *Old News*, a well-crafted collection of places, receipts=
,
headlines and stories =96 a most welcome offering in light of today=92s oft=
en
distanced (and distancing) reportage. We also have some fantastic news from
j. hastain and Johannes Goranss=F6n, who will be releasing their pages to u=
s
in the coming months.

In chapbook news, we have just finished pressing Nicole Mauro=92s *Tea Part=
y
Poems <http://furniturepressbooks.com/chaps/mauroteaparty/>*, a
faux-llaboration between Sarah Palin and Emily Dickinson, designed and
printed by the marvelous Jodi Hoover. Palin says of the collection, =93The
America I know and love is not one in which my parents or my baby with Down
Syndrome will have to stand in front of Obama=92s =91death panel=92 so his
bureaucrats can decide, based on a subjective judgment of their =91level of
productivity in society,=92 whether they are worthy of Nicole Mauro=92s Tea
Party Poems. Such a system is downright evil.=94 William Allegrezza, editor=
 of
Moria Books <http://www.moriapoetry.com/ebooks.html>, and Garin Cycholl
unleash their version of the Mississippi, *Aquinas*, which will be our firs=
t
large format collection with a soft cover. And! More loosy goosery from
Elizabeth Savage: Jane & Page or Sister Goose, an urgent take on image and
its schizophrenic counterpart. And when all is said and done, David Stone,
editor of Blackbird, an international anthology of art, poetry, prose,
visual poetry and media art, will unveil something sensuous, sinuous,
Stone-y.

Thanks to all who have invested energy, time, resources, capital and sweat
into making Furniture Press Books what it is.

Dear Everyone;

I recently began using a wide-screen monitor, and found that some pages =
of my "Reality Too-Blog" project of three years ago weren't holding =
position on the screen.
So I decided to redesign the format, and slightly update the =
introduction page.=20
Also, redistributing the project gives me the opportunity to include =
some new friends and colleagues.

What you're saying makes sense=2C though I'm not really in a position to sa=

floating or sinking dash doesn't seem intentional -- and here the reader is=
=2C speculating on intention --=20

Murat pointed out the line "presuming to lead" vs. "presuming to God" -- is=
 it "l" or "G?" -- and the fact that there's a choice there for the reader =
-- Howe chooses "lead" -- and as he wrote off-list=2C the choice is perhaps=
 "ideologically determined."  Howe's "guilty" of her choices in the transcr=
iption=2C but there's a faithfulness and recognition there that I've found =
lacking in others.  Or at least of a sort different from others and one I i=
dentify with more readily.  Higginson consistently told Dickinson she neede=
d to polish her verse (perhaps in the ways the early transcribers would)=2C=
 and Dickinson consistently refused.  She'd appear to insist here.  Even so=
=2C despite her insisting re the rough and rude=2C and this is interesting=
=2C she continually sought Higginson's ear.  Dickinson seems rather stubbor=
nly intentional=2C and my sense is Howe is exceptional in her recognition o=
f that.  But again=2C your point is well taken=2C as here things drifting i=

Hi Jared,

ED's manuscripts are on-line, I believe, and the consistencies of those
diacritical marks (as some insist the dashes are) are available for all
to see, but I would suggest that ED in cyberspace is a different, and
perhaps "non-authentic" presentation of ED's texts as they were
clearly meant to be read within the parameters of "book" technology of
the mid to late 19the century.

In order to do justice to the intention of the author, it's therefore
necessary to hold the poems in one's hand in as fragmentary a condition
as possible.  This is necessary to appreciate the sculptural--indeed the
haptic--qualities of Dickinson's "shaped" poems.  No, photographs are
not enough for this--ED clearly meant that some of her poems should be
published on scraps of paper of various tactile qualities, some sewn
together and kept in drawer-like enclosures (which should be reproduced)
and some presented appended to gifts (which should be reconstructed) or
flowers (live versions of which should be appended to the poem in
question and replaced as needed--thus maintaining the necessary
olfactory environment, which is yet another element of the author's
intention and indeed of the meaning of the poem itself, which should be
rightfully restored and conserved in order for accuracy to be
maintained).

The author's intention is certainly clear at least on this point: ED's
gift and flower-as-gift-poems should be presented intact and not
separated from their respective objects.  Thomas Johnson is not the only
scholar guilty of disrespecting ED's work and imposing a particularly
reductive view on her corpus, in this respect.

But, Jared, I would suggest that you take a look at those dashes as they
appear in the original manuscripts.  Take a few hours, or take a life
time, and report back.  Their use is about as consistent as other points
in Ed's handwriting and should be worth a whole new branch of Dickinson
study.

I haven't read all that'd be necessary to do so, but i have read some (and apologies for crossed wires -- that link was from the Birth-Mark!!! which, when it comes to Howe, i prefer.  thickets and my onw carelessness:). That said I'd say, with hesitation, that the floating or sinking dash doesn't seem intentional -- and here the reader is, speculating on intention --

>Murat pointed out the line "presuming to lead" vs. "presuming to God" -- is it "l" or "G?" -- and the fact that there's a choice there for the reader -- Howe chooses "lead" -- and as he wrote off-list, the choice is perhaps "ideologically determined."  Howe's "guilty" of her choices in the transcription, but there's a faithfulness and recognition there that I've found lacking in others.  Or at least of a sort different from others and one I identify with more readily.  Higginson consistently told Dickinson she needed to polish her verse (perhaps in the ways the early transcribers would), and Dickinson consistently refused.  She'd appear to insist here.  Even so, despite her insisting re the rough and rude, and this is interesting, she continually sought Higginson's ear.  Dickinson seems rather stubbornly intentional, and my sense is Howe is exceptional in her recognition of that.  But again, your point is well taken, as here things drifting into into intention which, as you
 indicated, D scholars in good faith attempt to understand..

Cynthia Arrieu-King and George Quasha reading in Cadmium series,
Kingston, NY

Saturday, February 12, 2011 at 2pm

The Gallery at R&F Handmade Paints
84 Ten Broeck Avenue
Kingston, NY 12401


A $5 donation is suggested.

For directions please visit R&F's website <http://www.rfpaints.com/>.

*Cynthia Arrieu-King *is an assistant professor of creative writing at
Stockton College and former Kundiman fellow. Her book /People are Tiny
in Paintings of China/ was released from Octopus Books in 2010. Her work
has or will appear this year in /Witness/, /Boston Review /and /Jacket/.
She lives near Atlantic City.

*George Quasha *works across mediums to explore principles in common
within language, sculpture, drawing, video, sound, installation, and
performance. Solo exhibitions of axial stones and axial drawings include
the Baumgartner Gallery in New York (Chelsea), the Slought Foundation in
Philadelphia, and at the Samuel Dorsky Museum of Art at SUNY New Paltz.
This work is featured in the published book, /Axial Stones: An Art of
Precarious Balance/, Foreword by Carter Ratcliff (North Atlantic Books:
Berkeley, 2006). In 2006 awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship in video art. A
new book, /An Art of Limina: Gary Hill's Works and Writings/, Foreword
by Lynne Cooke, is out from Ediciones Poligrafa (Barcelona), in
collaboration with Charles Stein (distrib. D.A.P. in US). 14 other books
include poetry (/Somapoetics/, /Giving the Lily Back Her Hands/, /Ainu
Dreams /[with Chie Hasegawa], /Preverbs/; anthologies (/America a
Prophecy /[with Jerome Rothenberg], /Open Poetry /[with Ronald Gross],
/An Active Anthology /[with Susan Quasha], /The Station Hill Blanchot
Reader/ [with Charles Stein]); and writing on art (/Gary Hill: Language
Willing/; with Charles Stein: /Tall Ships/, /HanD HearD/liminal
objects/, /Viewer/).

In the Gallery at R&F:

/Waxing Geometric/, a solo exhibition by painter, *Astrid Fitzgerald*.
The show will run from February 5th through March 19th, 2011. There will
be an opening reception for the artist and informal gallery talk on
Saturday, February 5th, from 5 to 7 p.m.

For Astrid Fitzgerald, painting is a spiritual pursuit and a path to
self-knowledge. Fitzgerald's work privileges the universal over the
personal, and is characterized by simple geometric elements. Her study
of Perennial Philosophy led to an appreciation of the Golden Mean, and
for over twenty-five years now, her work has explored philosophical
geometry, including the Fibonacci sequence, the Pythagorean Theorem and,
most importantly, the Golden Mean proportion, a unique ratio preferred
by nature as the most advantageous geometry for growth and energy
conservation.

If there is a common thread to my work it is the desire to uncover the
inner order in the world of appearances. I have always agreed with
Emerson's observation that "We must trust the perfection of the creation
so far as to believe that whatever curiosity the order of things has
awakened in our minds, the order of things can satisfy." -- Astrid
Fitzgerald

Born and educated in Switzerland, Astrid Fitzgerald has been living in
New York since 1961. Her work has been featured in over twenty solo
exhibitions in Europe, Asia and the United States, and included in over
40 group exhibitions. Fitzgerald's work is represented in many public,
private and corporate collections, including the Aldrich Contemporary
Art Museum, Ridgefield, CN; Wellesley College, Wellesley, MA; Marymount
College, Tarrytown, NY; Credit Suisse, NYC; and PES Architects, Nagoya,
Japan. An installation by Fitzgerald was selected to represent the US at
the ArtCanal Exposition in Le Landeron, Switzerland in 2002. She has
lectured on the Golden Mean proportion in art, and is the author of /An
Artist's Book of Inspiration---A Collection of Thoughts on Art, Artists,
and Creativity /(Lindisfarne Books, 1996) and /Being Consciousness
Bliss---A Seeker's Guide /(Lindisfarne Books, 2002). Fitzgerald
currently lives and works in Kerhonkson, New York.

He is the author of two books, Who Opens (Kenning Editions, 2006) and
Left Having (Kenning Editions, forthcoming) as well as chapbooks from
Hand Held Editions, Instance press, Answer Tag Press and the Chicago

language-based performance and music scores.

Anne-E Wood's work has appeared in journals like Tin House, New
Letters, Agni, Gargoyle, Other Voices, The Chicago Quarterly Review

Merche Blasco formed Burbuja as a vehicle for her own musical
exploration. Since its conception she has composed music to accompany
the sculptures of Lucy Orta at the Venice biennale, collaborated with
Chicks on Speed and composed soundtracks for videos and installations
by the artists of FABRICA (Italy) and HANGAR (Barcelona). For the last
year Burbuja has been enormously enriched by the musician Maitane
Beaumont and, for this performance, they will present a special
project together.

For some reason, I'm reminded irresistibly of Blake -- how many people
bother to read the Songs of Innocence and Experience (let alone the
Prophetic Books) in facsimile, let alone anything more authentic?

Then there's (to push this back even further) the little monograph
signatures that Thomas Wyatt placed beside some of the poems contained in
the Egerton manuscript ...

I once spent an hour at the British Library, trying to write out (staring at
the MS through glass) the specific notation that Wyatt placed beside some of
his poems.

An instructive experience ...

But comes down to it, I prefer to read Wyatt in a nicely-printed modernised
spelling edition.

For what that's worth.

Small Press in the Archive Lecture Series presents

Today @ 3:00 pm

Thom Donovan
"Meta-discourse and the (post-digital) book"
420 Capen, The Poetry Collection

Thom writes of his talk-performance this afternoon, " People are encouraged
to bring devices that feed to Twitter, Facebook, blogs (tho I suspect you
won't even have to prompt this) in the spirit of some of the stuff I am
talking about. They are also encouraged to write things down and upload
content later, if they would prefer to go the analogue to digital route
(feedback with delay)."

*Small Press in the Archive Lecture Series dedicates itself to the study of
poetry outside the traditional literary historical plot. The
lectures in this series draw on materials in The Poetry Collection, at SUNY
Buffalo in order to explore community/discourse formations, the status of
ephemera and the making of genre, the conditions of literary production,
transatlantic cross-pollinations in and between specific magazines, the
careers of poets, the role of book art, and how the little magazine
functions in the making of the avant-garde.*

Outside an abandoned school, a war rages.
Inside, three kids have been performing an unsupervised rendition of "King =
Lear" for years.
Further inside, the mad King debates the purpose of theater with his Fool, =
a licensed therapist.

Music of many kinds! The history of madness! Wild nature! The politics of p=
arenting! Courtroom drama! Strange poetry! Complex emotional events! Debate=
s on the social function of art! Friendship! Structural intricacy!=20

You will witness legendary tales from story time, and be served a small sna=
ck from our partially functioning cafeteria. You will also, at times, hear =
some Shakespeare.


"A crazy, densely layered, absurd riff on King Lear... Masterful acting, im=

I don't think there's anything clear about=20

world decisions faced by any publishing poet.=20
Like, no publisher will deliver the poems with a flower.

I'm also not convinced of the authority of the=20

indeed intended as such they're pretty awful, and=20
the rhymes and meters, which stay pretty close to=20
the hymnal, argue that there's no such intention.=20
The paper on which the fascicles are written=20
looks to me like binder's trim. (Has anybody=20
checked this out? It would be good to know at=20
least what papers they are.) Arrangement of verse=20
on them seems dictated by their narrowness rather than any aesthetic=
 decision.

We'll never know. We can be reasonably confident=20
that she wasn't trying to anticipate Williams or to mimic Whitman.

Best,

CFP for Open Letter

“Negotiating the Social Bond of Poetics”
Edited by Nancy Gillespie and Peter Jaeger

The idea for this issue of Open Letter developed out of a year long
series of poetry readings and critical seminars run by Nancy Gillespie
at the Kootenay School of Writing in Vancouver, under the title
“Negotiating the Social Bond of Poetics.” The series drew on Jacques
Lacan’s concept of the “four discourses,” in particular his Seminar
XVII: The Other Side of Psychoanalysis (published in English for the
first time in 2007). Delivered shortly after the May 1968 events in
Paris, this seminar engages with social interaction and its relation to
language and power. Key to the seminar are Lacan’s four structures of
discourses—i.e., the discourse of the Master, the University, the
Hysteric, and the Analyst—and how these discourses form different social
bonds for the subject.
We are looking for critical writing and poetry that responds to the
questions below: Although Lacan’s seminar was first presented 40 years
ago, it is arguable that Lacan’s scepticism of the '68 events, and his
assertion that the discourse of the University was becoming a new
Master’s discourse, foresaw the dawn of a new ethos of capitalism that
we now call Neo-Liberalism. Can returning to Lacan’s theory now offer
new and useful methods of criticism? Is Lacan’s theory of the “four
discourses” useful for rethinking how we engage with and disseminate
poetry and poetics? Can poetics operate like the discourse of the
Analyst to create a different social bond through language? Is Lacan’s
concept of the structure of the four discourses useful for us today,
particularly as we head into financial cuts in the arts and academia
which may limit interventions in hegemonic discourses?

Please send critical proposals to gillespie.nancy@googlemail.com and
poetry proposals or declarations of intention to
p.jaeger@roehampton.ac.uk by March 15th, 2011.
We are also interested in work that blurs these boundaries, which should
be sent to both of us.
Complete work will be requested by mid-August 2011.

We'll, I've been working the Ouija board pretty hard since posting on
this topic and have made a few break-throughs as far as ED's ultimate
intentions for her fascicles.  Next step: scrying stones as per John
Dee, Edward Kelly and Joseph Smith.  My TV-watching table has been
scratched, rapped, and rotated repeatedly when I mention both the names
Emily and Susan (for some 1855ish reason) and I've been picking up
whispered female voices on blank tapes in the middle of the day.  Stay
tuned for transcendental illumination, Mark and all the list ladies who
haven't yet breathed a word on this subject.  (Yes, I've noticed!
:-)) Laughing sans Let-up,  Jess of Japan

Hello, all!



The theater/new music group I work with, the Nonsense Company, will be
performing our newest play, STORM STILL, at PS122 in New York City,
starting a week from today. I think it will be of interest to poets
(and others). I hope some of you can make it.





all the best,





Andy G. =






STORM STILL


written and performed by the Nonsense Company


(Ryan Higgins, Andy Gricevich and Rick Burkhardt)


February 19th through March 6th, 2011


8 p.m. (Sunday shows at 6 p.m.)


PS122


150 1st Avenue, New York NY


http://www.nonsensecompany.com





STORM STILL
Outside an abandoned school, a war rages.
Inside, three kids have been performing an unsupervised rendition of "Ki=
ng Lear" for years.
Further inside, the mad King debates the purpose of theater with his Foo=
l, a licensed therapist.

Music of many kinds! The history of madness! Wild nature! The politics o=
f parenting! Courtroom drama! Strange poetry! Complex emotional events! =
Debates on the social function of art! Friendship! Structural intricacy!=
 =


You will witness legendary tales from story time, and be served a small =
snack from our partially functioning cafeteria. You will also, at times,=
 hear some Shakespeare.


"A crazy, densely layered, absurd riff on King Lear... Masterful acting,=
 impeccable timing, beautiful language and magical sound effects =E2=80=94=
 a book will literally talk =E2=80=94 plus moments that are completely w=
eird... It's hard to keep your eyes or ears off it. Must see!"

Richard Chin, Twin Cities Pioneer Press


"Razor-sharp dissections of youth, power, and purpose... If you ever tho=
ught your therapist was a fool,
wait until you see this."

Chalk Editions recently published THREE LONGPOEMS, which I wrote during =
my "transitional period" in 1999-2000, after Peter Ganick's Potes & =
Poets Press gave me a crash course in contemporary poetics.. Note that I =
wrote "GROUND ZERO" at least a year before the World Trade Center site =
acquired the name after the 9/11 attack. In this poem, Ground Zero =
refers to the nuclear testing grounds in the southwestern United Stales =
and to trumpeter Bill Dixon's approach to free improvisation.

Subject:      Emily Dickinson and "the Learned Blacksmith" Elihu Burrit--A
              Possible Source (of many) for "I like to see it lap the Miles--"
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

Every time I scan through the back issues of the Clarksville (TN.)
Chronicle, I find another gem.  In the Jan. 20the, 1846 issue, I
stumbled across the fine writing of a remarkable gentleman who called
himself "The Learned Blacksmith."  Similar to another working class
autodidact, the Scottish stone-carver Hugh Miller, Burritt had a
distinct gift for languages, and a flair for descriptive writing.
Largely forgotten today, Burritt was no doubt well known to Emily
Dickinson both in his popular volumes, and in his numerous newspaper
appearances over the years.  (ED was a reader of newspapers and
magazines--see the great study of popular culture's influence on
American lit Beneath the American Renaissance.)

ED's "I like to see it lap the Miles--" dates (according to Seward)
from the 1850's, but I can't doubt but that a poet of her gifts would
not have been struck by Burritt's description of an "iron horse"
enough to have remembered it.

Here is the passage from the paper.

"The Steam Horse

Elihu Burritt has a better fancy for a steam horse than we remember to
have met elsewhere before.  This is his way of describing him:

I love to see one of those huge creatures, with sinews of brass and
muscles of iron, strut forth from his smoky stable, and saluting the
long train of cars with a dozen sonorous puffs from his iron nostrils,
fall gently back into his harness.  There he stands, champing and
foaming upon the iron track, his great heart a furnace of glowing coals;
lymphatic blood is boiling in his veins; the strength of a thousand
horses is nerving his sinews, he pants to be gone.  He would 'snake'
St. Peter's across the desert of Sahara, if he could be fairly hitched
to it; but there is a little sober-eyed man in the saddle who holds him
with a finger, who can take away his breath in a moment, should he grow
restive and vicious.  I am always deeply interested in this man; for
begrimed as he may be with coal, diluted in oil and steam, I habitually
regard him as the genius of the whole machinery, as the physical mind of
that huge steam horse."

ED's poem:

I like to see it lap the Miles--
And lick the Valleys up--
And stop to feed itself at Tanks--
And then--prodigious step

Around a Pile of Mountains--
And supercilious peer
In Shanties--by the sides of Roads--
And then a Quarry pare

To fit its Ribs
And crawl between
Complaining all the while
In horrid--hooting stanza--
Then chase itself down Hill--

And neigh like Boanerges--
Then--punctual as a Star
Stop--docile and omnipotent
At its own stable door.

Of course, ED's poem goes well beyond Burritt's description in boldness
of invention and plain linguistic brilliance, but still the similarities
give one pause.  Jess

David Wolach is editor of Wheelhouse Magazine & Press and an active
participant in Nonsite Collective. Wolach's first full-length poetry
collection, Occultations, has just been published by Black Radish
Books. Other books include the multi-media transliteration plus
chapbook, Prefab Eulogies Volume 1: Nothings Houses (BlazeVox
[books], 2010), the full-length Hospitalogy (chapbook forth. from
Scantily Clad Press, 2011), and book alter(ed) (Ungovernable Press,
2009). A former union organizer and performing artist out of New
York, Wolach's work often begins as site-specific and interactive
performance and ends up as shaped, written language. Recent work
appears in Jacket, Augfabe, Try Magazine, No Tell Motel, and Little
Red Leaves. Wolach is professor of text arts, poetics, and aesthetics
at The Evergreen State College, co-curating the PRESS text arts &
radical politics series there, and is visiting professor in Bard
College's Workshop In Language & Thinking. He's currently touring
with his Olympia-based experimental performance ensemble, performing
Kenneth Gaburo's opus Maledetto alongside original cross-media work
from the eight full-time members.

Laura Elrick's latest project is a book-length poem, as yet untitled,
that explores the relationship between speed (social time) and
utterance; translations and affective condensations occur in the tiny
caverns between the compulsion toward language and the patrolling of
intelligible expressive registers. She also recently coordinated
Blocks Away, a psychogeography of Lower Manhattan, some documentation
of
which will be displayed in The Skybridge Art and Sound Space at The
New School in Spring 2011. Previous work includes the video/poem
Stalk ("part dystopian urban cartography, part spatial-poetic
intervention"), as well a set of 5 audio pieces for doubled-voice.
She has also written two books of poetry: Fantasies in Permeable
Structures (Factory School 2005) and sKincerity (Krupskaya 2003), and
an essay "Poetry, Ecology, and the Reappropriation of Lived Space,"
which can be found in the Eco Language Reader (2010) and online at
The Brooklyn Rail. She currently teaches at Pratt Institute in
Brooklyn.

Lara Durback is a notebook writer, using handwriting primarily, and
that means walking around and writing. Public transportation is a big
part of that city writing. You can find recent work with and without
handwriting in WORK, Try, There Journal, etc. Also look for her work
on Deep Oakland.org. She is also a letterpress printer, and manages
the Book Art studio at Mills College. She has recently finished
printing the book Picture Cameras with Ariel Goldberg using only
repurposed materials (NoNo Press).

The Book House in Dinkytown is sponsoring  John Berryman: Poet and =
Teacher, A Celebration on Thursday, February 17th at 7:00pm in the Red =
Room at the Loring Pasta Bar, 327 14th Avenue Southeast, Minneapolis, =
MN.  Admission is free.  Parking validation is available through the =
Book House if you park in the lot behind the shop off 5th Street SE. =20
                                         =20
John Berryman won the Pulitzer Prize for 77 Dream Songs which he =
published in 1964.  His poetry has been described as boldly original and =
innovative.  He was also a brilliant and passionate teacher who taught =
at the University of Minnesota from 1955 to his death in 1972.=20
=20
Join us for an evening of Dream Songs and reminiscences. Actor and =
writer Ben Kreilkamp will read from a selection of his work interspersed =
with remembrances from his students, colleagues and those who knew him. =
Guests for the evening will include Kate Donahue, Michael Dennis Browne, =
Richard Kelly, Michael Mann, Patricia Kirkpatrick, and Judith Koll =
Healey. =20

Berryman fans will also have an opportunity to listen for the first time =
to rare Berryman tapes, and share in a reading of personal statements =
from well known authors who are unable to attend the event.  An exhibit =
of photocopied manuscript materials from the Andersen archives will =
highlight how various Dream Songs evolved from scraps of paper to =
typescripts ready for submission to Berryman's publisher.  "Huffy Henry" =
didn't start out as 'huffy' at all.=20

Ben Kreilkamp was recently interviewed about the event by Ian Leask of =
KFAI's Write On Radio!  =20

For more information about the event, please call The Book House in =
Dinkytown at (612)331-1430 or email ourbookhouseindinkytown@gmail.com.=20=

Hello all! I wonder if anyone out there knows where the term "dirty
concrete" came from (a term which I know Stephen Scobie and others
have used to describe Steve McCaffery's work).

Any leads or tips would be just wonderful - thanks -

Hi All,

I have a new class starting in NYC and I'd appreciate it if you could
forward this to interested parties.

Thanks very much,
Lisa Jarnot

I'm going to be teaching a ten-week reading/writing workshop on
Saturdays (3-5 pm) beginning March 5.  The class will be organized
around a comprehensive view of Robert Duncan's life and career, with
special attention to Duncan's recently published critical work on
Modernism, The H.D. Book.  We'll do writing around Duncan's own
writing, with attention to his influences and peers and students
(Gertrude Stein, Ezra Pound, Helen Adam, Jack Spicer, Charles Olson,
Michael Palmer, etc.) and we'll listen to recordings of RD's lectures
and readings. Students will also bring their own work and projects to
share with the class.  Fee is $300 for 10 weeks. (payment by
installment is possible.)  If you have questions or if you'd like to
reserve a spot, email me at ljarnot@gmail.com.

As an almost certainly irrelevant aside, Thomas Wentworth Higginson who
figures as ED's first (non)publisher also has a minor place in the history
of American Cant Scholarship.

He was profoundly impressed by the writings of Henry Tufts, and believed, on
the evidence which Tufts retailed, in the existence of The Great American
Criminal Conspiracy.

While he was not admittedly alone in this delusion (the Reverend B.F.Tefft,
writing in 1848 in _The Ladies' Journal__ which he was editing at this time,
on the authority of the Napoleon of Burglars, also believed this), he does
tend to exhibit a credulity verging on the imbecilic.

What relation this has to his editorial and critical on the work of the
Sainted Emily, I leave for others to decide.

Back in the day we used to talk about dirty con and clean con.
Dirty con was the stuff you did by typing over other typing but a bit
off.
Anything with smears etc.
Generally the stuff bpNichol was doing was clean con
and the stuff bill bissett was doing was dirty con.
There was a difference of intent.
Dirty con was generally done by poets who wanted to strike against
hoitsy toitsy aestheticism.

Zinc Bar Reading Series
presents:

A Book Party
for Donald Wellman's
A NORTH ATLANTIC WALL

with Joel Lewis and Norman Finkelstein

*Friday, Feb 18 @ 6:30 PM*

*at Zinc Bar*
*82 W 3rd St*
*New York, NY*



*Donald Wellman*, poet, essayist, and editor, lives in Weare NH. His poetry
includes *A North Atlantic Wall*, recently released by Dos Madres Press. In
2009, his *Prolog Pages*was published by ahadada. Other titles include *
urika*, a chapbook from boat train in Gloucester, *baroque threads*(Mudlark)
and *Fields* (Light and Dust). He has written about his life on the coast of
Maine, as well as his experiences in Mexico, spain and Morocco. He has
written extensively on Charles Olson, William Carlos Williams, and Ezra
Pound.



*Joel Lewis* is the author of *Learning From New Jersey*(2007), *Tasks Of
The Youth Leagues* (2006) , *Vertical's Currency* (1999) and *House Rent
Boogie* (1992). He edited*Bluestones and Salt Hay*, an anthology of
contemporary NJ poets, as well as editing the *Reality Prime*, the selected
poems of Walter Lowenfels and *On The Level Everyday: the selected talks of
Ted Berrigan*. He has also written hundreds of articles, reviews, essays and
profiles and currently is a staff writer at the New Jersey Performing Arts
Center in Newark. A social worker by day, he has taught creative writing at
the Poetry Project, The Writer's Voice and Rutgers University. And, for
better or worse, he initiated the ill-fated New Jersey Poet Laureate
position that was such a headache for Amiri Baraka. With his wife, film
theorist Sandy Flitterman-Lewis, he resides in Hoboken.



*Norman Finkelstein*'s books of poetry include *Restless Messengers*
(University
of Georgia Press, 1992), *Passing**  *

five books of literary criticism: *The Utopian Moment in Contemporary
American Poetry* (Bucknell University Press, 1988; 2nd ed., 1993), *The
Ritual of New Creation: Jewish Tradition and Contemporary Literature* (SUNY
Press, 1992), *Not One of Them In Place: Modern Poetry and Jewish** American
Identity* (SUNY Press, 2001), *Lyrical Interference: Essays on

    Verbal Paradise (preverbs) (2011)

/This is the first book of a projected six books of *"preverbs*,"
published by Zasterle Press (editor Manuel Brito) in La Laguna (Canary
Islands, Spain) distributed and sold in the USA by SPD.

About this book:


"Words say too much to let you know the truth.'' George Quasha's
torqued, enigmatic proverbs create unlikely balances among discrepant
engagements. The vectors of these marvelous poems work at cross
purposes, keeping each other aloft. These are sparkling aphoristic
aporias for a new age in an old time.  "Poetry," says Quasha, "resists
immortality with difficulty." And also with wit and charm. Be /here/
now, in which case immortality will take care of itself.

Charles Bernstein


Ludic, glittering dialectic, that's the true feeling of the ongoing
dance in /preverbs,/ here now in a first volume, /Verbal Paradise. /The
lines are all children, bright and witty children, egging each other on
to say fast as they can what they don't yet know. And we can know only
by listening to them tussle. It's the antiphonal give-and-take that
makes these poems so different from other couplets, qasidas, dyads. They
refuse to be ruled even by the form they propose. So reading them is an
athletic conversation. And not just the poem with itself. What happens
is that as I read along, I begin to talk back--in accord or
grumblement---with some brave line, only to find a line or two later the
poem answering my comment. The poem gets there before me. I like that.

Mid-sixties Gestetner mimeograph mags, David Sandberg's "Or" in San Francisco,
for example, or "Work" and "Change" in Detroit: printed on heavy stock with that
thin edge between typographic clarity and ink blur - got the reader involved in
the way of looking very closely, as if it was also the reader's responsibility
to secure 'the text' (no one ever said 'text' in 1965!). But then I don't
remember anybody saying, 'dirty concrete.'  Perhaps we said, "funky & good."
Maybe 'dirty concrete' is also akin to having that 'garbage sound' on LP records
before CD's came along to cleanup and make everything sterile and 'presentable.'

Subject: Re: origin of the term "dirty concrete"?

Back in the day we used to talk about dirty con and clean con.
Dirty con was the stuff you did by typing over other typing but a bit off.
Anything with smears etc.
Generally the stuff bpNichol was doing was clean con
and the stuff bill bissett was doing was dirty con.
There was a difference of intent.
Dirty con was generally done by poets who wanted to strike against hoitsy toitsy
aestheticism.

First place I came across it in print was in a sequence of notes and letter=
s by various people (Bob Cobbing, Henri Chopin, Deiter Rot, DSH, and a coup=
le others) in the anthology that Cobbing and Peter Meyer put together calle=
d Concerning Concrete.( I had been using it independantly before coming acr=
oss it that to describe the difference between certain kinds of English wor=
k like Cobbing's, Furnival's and even some of DSH's and the clean lines of =
the Swiss/German/Brazilian folks--this last is a bit reductive, but is indi=
cative of work that for me has a quality of opening out into multiple possi=
bilities and work that tends towards a closed set of readerly content--the =
clean work tends to be controlled and controlling in a way that leaves litt=
le freedom for the reader)

Hello all! I wonder if anyone out there knows where the term "dirty
concrete" came from (a term which I know Stephen Scobie and others
have used to describe Steve McCaffery's work).

Any leads or tips would be just wonderful - thanks -

Dear all:

At the suggestion of the residency leaders here at Banff Ctre for the
Arts, I've initiated a new blog, Text, Textile, Exile.
Please make suggestions for relevant inclusions on sidebars etc., though
I've already forgotten how to add that stuff. I promise I'll relearn.

Dear Lori,

Please check out the movie "Dirty Dancing"--The young Steve McCaffery
was an extra on the set, which was primarily of old Roman concrete--most
of it flown in from the hills of Tuscany.  Steve believed in dancing
dirty with the best of them, but he was particularly fond of "the soft
shoe," so he'd fill his pockets full of grit before scenes, sprinkle
the grit on the ancient concrete and awaaaaaay he'd go!  He really had
"the time of his life!" and considered continuing his dancing career,
but his "writing senses"  got the better of him and he chose instead
to become a famous professor and poet with many impressive volumes now
under his belt.  You can still visit the set of Dirty Dancing in the old
sound lot and most of that Roman concrete remains impervious to the
incursions of Hollywood weather, though little by little the majescules
of the graffiti carved surreptitiously upon it with compass
legs--largely by middle-aged mathematics teachers mourning the passing
of Patrick Swayze and whatever wild youths they may have imagined they
had had--are fading in much the same way as an answer rendered up by a
"Magic 8 Ball" when the harmless but oracular toy is given a decided
shake.

This chapter in Dr. McCaffery's life has largely been overlooked, and I
thank you, Lori, for the opportunity to throw some light on it.

Sincerely,

Jess

Any relation to the phrase (if I have the spelling right) "sale
existentialiste"?

Sounds as if dirty/clean con might parallel a distinction between typewriter
concrete and typeset concrete.  In sixties Scottish concrete poetry, this
difference would be exemplified by (respectively) Edwin Morgan and Ian
Hamilton Finlay.

Bern Porter once sent me some material for a review I was editing, but I
kept it a little too long and he sent me a wonderful post card saying
colorful things.  Of course the review appeared, he got his copy (I
think) and I kept the post card in remembrance.  Since my move to Japan,
I haven't been able to locate it, though sometimes I almost recall what
it said.  Happy b-day Bern Porter--you're above the Empyrean now with
James Schevile, your good friend--(and a fine poet btw).  Jess

I remember a reading at The Lab or someplace like that in SF around
1986-1988, Stephen McCaffery (featured that evening I think with Beverly
Dahlen) did a kind of performance piece comprised essentially of "FULL
and Extra-Physical Enunciation" of "text" pared down all the way to the
Ground Level of individual letters, perhaps in fact JUST ONE letter, the
letter T (at least that is the one that I best remember).  He
articulated, "t, t, t, T, T, T, T, T, T" and so on and so forth. Indeed,
he wanted to, let's say, FULLY ACTUALIZE the entire experiential range
of the universal physicality of the letter T, all that ear, tongue,
mouth, lungs, and even esophagus FEEL/Contact when it, the letter T, is
stripped of its (Capitalist?) conventional utility or any kind of
marketable semantic association or "burden" (Williams).   (I guess
that's "My Stephen McCaffery" that evening, anyways...) =20

=20

In effect, or maybe Full Effect, he really, really engaged us
somatically and carnally with his intensely evocative accentuation and
"primitive," roof-shaking, thunderous enunciation of the letter T.  He
SPIT it right into some of us in the first couple rows of seats, in
fact.  NOW, if that wasn't one of the most "concrete" poetries I have
ever witnessed, No, I should say _EXPERIENCED_, then I don't know what
is (other than what Robert Grenier does, and leaves, on the page, also
"minimalist," but more a graphic or visual "concrete," while
McCaffery's, obviously, is dramatically SOUND-based and Extremely Oral,
of course.)  Anyhow, given that a good bit of good clean spit was
emitted, surely that kind of poming would/could be called "dirty
concrete," in my humble opinion.

Back in the day we used to talk about dirty con and clean con.

Dirty con was the stuff you did by typing over other typing but a bit
off.

Anything with smears etc.

Generally the stuff bpNichol was doing was clean con and the stuff bill
bissett was doing was dirty con.

There was a difference of intent.

Dirty con was generally done by poets who wanted to strike against
hoitsy toitsy aestheticism.

MEZANGELLE'N W/ MEZ

MEZ : "A Mezzian Flesh-Mote enters a library.  In a networked sense
this library is cold; binary data advancements are yet to make any
perceivable impact on its manifest functions.  A silvered sliver-glint
pulls the Mezzian Mote forward to the only technoniche available -- a
computer laboratory, used primarily for word-processing tasks.  It
also has an Internet connection.  A Datadervish [E-Mote] is born, and
a Flesh-Mote is extinguished..."

Just got a copy, and it looks E-x-c-e-l-l-e-n-t --

A MEGAPHONE collects a number of enactments that Juliana Spahr and  Stephanie
Young did between the years of 2005-2007. In these enactments,  they attempted
to think with the playful dogmatism of a feminist  tradition that they call
"crotchless pants and a machine gun" (obviously  referencing Valie Export) in
order to locate what might still be useful  today about the somewhat beleaguered
"second wave" feminist traditions.  To that end, Spahr and Young lectured in
Oulipian slenderized baby talk  about figures such as Carolee Schneemann and
Marina Abramovic; they  counted the numbers of women and men and tansgendered
people in various  poetry anthologies; and they invited writers from outside the
US to talk  about being a writer where they live (over seventy-five writers from
Puerto Rico to Morocco to Croatia to South Africa to Syria to Micronesia  to
Korea responded). Also included in A MEGAPHONE are discussions of  that always
contested relationship between feminism and "experimental"  poetry by Julian T.
Brolaski, E. Tracy Grinnell, Paul Foster Johnson,  Christian Peet, Barbara Jane
Reyes, Dale Smith, and A. E. Stallings. The  book ends with a (soma)tic writing
exercise from CAConrad, one designed  to encourage readers and writers to create
open, yet still meaningful,  feminist alliances.

I can attest to what Jesse has said about Steve's career.
If you have a look at his belt, which was probably his father's belt,
you will see a lot of books tucked under there.
In fact some of them aren't even by him!
But who cares? We love Steve.

This is the correct term--and it actually doesn't surprise me and it
shouldn't surprise you either, Lori, or the other members of this list.
 Yours faithfully on the definitional frontiers, Jess of Japan.

Hope to see you next week! Additional information and Facebook invite

Come celebrate the release of Bernadette Mayer=92s STUDYING HUNGER JOURNALS
(Station Hill Press). In part, the journals explore psyche and were
undertaken, in cahoots with a psychiatrist via two running journals, so tha=
t
while she kept writing in one he could read the other. She wrote in colored
pens, intending to =93color-code emotions=94=97to see if her synaesthetic a=
bility
to see letters as colors might act as a bridge to seeing emotions. She had
had an idea: =93=85if a human, a writer, could come up with a workable code=
, or
shorthand, for the transcription of every event, every motion, every
transition of his or her own mind, & could perform this process of
translation on himself, using the code=85 he or we or someone could come up
with a great piece of language/information.=94 While an abridged edition
appeared in 1975 with Adventures In Poetry/Big Sky, this is the full text o=
f
that enterprise. Bernadette Mayer is the author of more than two dozen
volumes of poetry, including Midwinter Day, Sonnets, The Desires of Mothers
to Please Others in Letters, and Poetry State Forest. A former director of
the Poetry Project at St. Mark=92s Church in the Bowery and co-editor of th=
e
conceptual magazine 0 to 9 with Vito Acconci, Mayer has been a key figure o=
n
the New York poetry scene for decades. The book will be read by a wide rang=
e
of luminaries including, Lee Ann Brown, Barbara Epler, Phil Good, Bernadett=
e
Mayer, Don Yorty, Michael Ruby, Marie Warsh, Lewis Warsh, Adam Fitzgerald,
Peggy Decoursey, Bill Kushner, Bill Denoyelles, Deborah Poe, Peter Baker,
Miles Champion, Anne Waldman and CA Conrad.

About *Studying Hunger Journals*



In 1972 Bernadette Mayer began this project as an aid to psychological
counseling, writing in parallel journals so that, as she wrote in one (in
bed, on subways, at parties, etc.), her psychiatrist read the other. Using
colored pens to =93color-code emotions,=94 she recorded dreams, events,
memories, and reflections in a language at once free-ranging and precise=97=
a
work that creates its own poetics. She sought =93a workable code, or
shorthand, for the transcription of every event, every motion, every
transition=94 of her own mind and to =93perform this process of translation=
=94 on
herself in the interest of evolving an innovative, inquiring language.
*Studying
Hunger Journals *registers this intention within a body of poetry John
Ashbery has called =93magnificent.=94





Word on *Studying Hunger Journals*:



When the first published version of *Studying Hunger* appeared under Larry
Fagin=92s and my combined Big Sky/Adventures in Poetry imprint, an artist
friend said that Bernadette Mayer=92s writing showed bad manners; this happ=
ily
called up a 1960s critic=92s estimation of deKooning=92s abrupt shifts of s=
tyle
as a mark of =93the bad manners of genius.=94 Presuming to take on unruly
consciousness as a topic (=93as such=94) must have been part of what my art=
ist
friend meant. Is Bernadette Mayer a Conceptual Poet? Any idea of
consciousness is bound to be conceptual, but consciousness=96=96however gra=
ced,
though inconsiderate in action=96=96can be apprehended only sensationally.
That=92s what you think. The sassy, self-endangered, forensic writing in
STUDYING HUNGER JOURNALS runs wildly ahead of such considerations=96=96bad =
in
the best way, like religious experience.

=96=96*Bill Berkson*



Made public at last in its gorgeous various and unstinting entirety, *Study=
ing
Hunger Journals *reveals itself to be one of the great in fact epic works o=
f
a movement that could never be given a name. No label fit for such limitles=
s
activity, its terms being those of our restless language and its relentless
go-betweens that move and may alter. Attend therefore and let them have
their  way, these words given without let and best received in kind.

*=97Clark Coolidge*

* *

Someone irritated me recently by saying =93Our time lacks a poet=92s poet. =
You
know, a poet who gets you writing.=94 SHAME ON YOU I said. YOU ARE LIVING O=
N
THE PLANET WHERE BERNADETTE MAYER LIVES AND WRITES! Are there bigger
shoulders we stand on today? I don=92t think so. Every time I=92m in the sa=
me
room as Bernadette I look around and think, =93She is the best poet and
smartest person here!=94 My religion is Poetry and Bernadette Mayer is High
Priestess!

=97*CAConrad*

* *

We have been waiting a long time=97decades, in fact=97for the publication
of *Studying
Hunger Journals*, so this is an occasion to celebrate=97that they have come
into the world, into the light, and into our hands. Mayer=92s experiment, h=
er
transcription of consciousness, is timeless and sexy. There is gentle geniu=
s
in her heroic quest to be =93an observer of self in process.=94

PHILIP GUSTON: A LIFE LIVED + DISCUSSED
Clark Coolidge + Bill Berkson, in dialogue

Monday March 14th, 7:00 pm
Balboa Theatre, 3630 Balboa Street, San Francisco
Poets Clark Coolidge and Bill Berkson will discuss the life, work and
influence of one of the most intellectually adventurous and poetically
gifted of modern painters, in light of the newly published Collected
Writings, Lectures and Conversations of Philip Guston (UC Press). Over the
course of his life, Guston=92s wide reading in literature and philosophy ev=
er
deepened his commitment to his art =97 from his early Abstract Expressionis=
t
paintings to his later gritty, intense figurative works.

Clark Coolidge, editor of the new UC Press volume, has published many books
of poetry and prose, among them a collaboration with Guston, Baffling Means=
:
Writings/Drawings (O-Blek Editions), Now It=92s Jazz: Writings on Kerouac &
The Sounds (Living Batch), and most recently, This Time We Are Both (Ugly
Duckling).

Bill Berkson is a poet, art critic, corresponding editor for Art in America=
,
and long-time professor of literature and art history at the San Francisco
Art Institute. His many books include a collaboration with Guston, Enigma
Variations (Big Sky), and most recently, For the Ordinary Artist: Short
Reviews, Occasional Pieces and More (BlazeVOX).

Patrick James Dunagan, author of There Are People Who Say That Painters
Shouldn=92t Talk: A GUSTONBOOK (Post-Apollo), will introduce the dialogue
following a screening of the Michael Blackwood documentary film, Philip
Guston: A Life Lived.
 This event is presented by Bird & Beckett Cultural Legacy Project, a
501(c)(3) non-profit organization housed at Bird & Beckett Books and Record=
s
in San Francisco.

$10 admission.

Libya, Kadafi, is committing genocide against its 'own people' in order to
protect his enormous oil wealth.

No matter the immediate fall out - and horrifying it is - it seems to be crucial
for European and other nations to invest heavily in the creation of solar based
power plants across the Sahara - both as a way of employment for North Africans
(and a deterrent to the need to migrate) and the provision of an  energy supply
that can support the supplanting of oil dependence and the corporate  and state
autocrats that viciously control these oil based nations.

Praise for Nothing is in Here:

"This book percolates with the nervous jitters of a new syntax, highly
compressed into gigabyte format, and it attacks the central nervous system
of the reader. In my day it used to be 'dudes,' but today it's all the young
screens that carry the news. . If, due to a saturation of such memes, the
fact of the sentence has lost urgency, maybe it's the job of the poet to
point out what we've lost while instructing us in the delight of our debris.
No one demonstrates this fact of digital life better than poet Andrew Levy,
whose first EOAGH collection arrives at a critical moment in our nation's
horologics. If you could synchronize this book to all your inner clocks,
you'd be a good forty-five seconds ahead of the rest of the world at all
times."

- Kevin Killian

"With barely concealed irony, downright humor, a large wedge of anger and a
small edge of wistfulness, Andrew Levy views everything from the 'urban
interruption' of mid-town Manhattan to the corrupt politics of G.W. Bush,
from war and torture to religiosity and outright mendacity. There's more:
invented personae, pop culture, the bubble economy, friends and family,
beauty and envy. Even the Brooklyn Bridge makes an appearance. Just about
everything is in Nothing is in Here. And the title itself is a bright lure:
'Nothing is in here we' re forced to debate.' The terms are given in the
beginning: 'Nothing is in here. So, I make it look as different as
possible.'"

**No Press
http://derekbeaulieu.wordpress.com/

No Press was founded by Derek Beaulieu in 2005. After the cessation of
publishing his housepress imprint (1997-2004) Beaulieu returned to
publishing as "no press" as means of publishing and circulating
experimental, conceptual and concrete poetries. Dedicated to small press
forms - leaflets, broadsides, chapbooks, pamphlets and other ephemeral form=
s
- no press has released almost 200 publications in 6 years (averaging 1
every 2 weeks) in editions of between 5 and 100. Items are often out of
print the same as publication, and represent a truly ephemeral means of
distributing these marginalized forms.

Kevin McPherson Eckhoff likes visual poetry and even wrote Rhapsodomancy
(Coach House). In theory, he is not afraid of snakes. His writing has

Don=B9t try to feed him steak! He sleeps in Armstrong, B.C., with his
dog-rescuing partner, Laurel, and =B3teaches=B2 at Okanagan College with his
very bff, Jake Kennedy (The Lateral, Snare Books). Together, Jake and Kevin
are compiling a community-written novel called Death Valley.

g
is kinda conceptual and sorta involves identity issues that are complicated
by the web. And the Mall. Recent titles include: Now We Are Friends (Truck
Books), Rob the Plagiarist (Roof Books), and Notes On Conceptualisms,
co-authored with Vanessa Place (Ugly Duckling Presse). He teaches writing
and poetry at New York University and at the Bard College, Milton Avery

and experimental book from a nimble poetic mind. It includes an elegiac
found-long-poem that gathers all the =B3Acker=B2 keyword tags from the Flickr
database and reapplies them as words-of-lament for the revolutionary
artist-writer Kathy Acker (1947-97), a series of prose-poem-ruminations tha=

ED's younger sister Lavinia resembled Yvonne de Carlo, and was, along
with Emily--rumored to the life of the party--even a bit "wild"
according to Richard B. Sewall's excellent biography The Life of Emily
Dickinson.

Here is an excerpt of an antebellum reminiscence of Lavinia by Joseph
Bardwell Lyman, a gentleman who knew both the Dickinsons very well, but
was close to marrying Lavinia.

***

"I was very happy in Vinnies [sic] arms--very happy.  She sat in my lap
and pulled the pins from her long soft chestnut hair and tied the long
silken mass around my neck and kissed me again & again.  She was always
at my side clinging to my arm and used to have a little red ottoman
that she brought & placed close by my chair and laid her book across my
lap when she read.  Her skin was very soft.  Her arms were fat & white
and I was very, very happy with her....

But more interesting than this was Lyman's (and other visitors'
observations) on the similarities of ED's and LD's speech patterns and
turns of phrase.  Though Emily's speech was declared by Lyman, and
others, including Lavinia, as brilliant, it was noted that there was an
echo of ED's trope making in LD's talk and writing.  I find this
utterly fascinating.  I would predict that this same sort of language
use could probably have been discerned in Austin's familial language as
well, and perhaps in the Mother's and most definitely the Father's.
How much of highly original language use is actually a reflection of
private language play and other idiomatic uses of language within the
home?  The Bronte family is another example.  I would also point to
Wallace Stevens and his intense and private home life.

***

Finally, Lavinia Dickinson was also something of a poet and in the
Dickinson papers at Harvard is a 17 page manuscript of LD's poems which
she typed in 1898.  Sewell gives an excerpt (pgs. 250--252 in the
one-volume paperback edition)--I'll include several.

Night

The stars kept winking and blinking,
as if they had secrets to tell;
But nobody asked any questions,
Nobody heard any tales.

***

Fire-Flies

The fire-flies hold their lanterns high
To guide the falling star,
But, if by chance the wicks grow short
The stars might lose their way.

***

The wind hung high in the trees last night
And threw the branches down,
And sang weird tunes the elfins made,
And then the world was still.

***

"And yet", is such a simple phrase--
It hardly seems worth mending;
But many a bliss has tripped just here,
Because this fatal footing.

***

Indifference is as sure to kill
As smokeless powder's mark,
So be cautious how you trifle
With a heart of any size.

***

There's no indication just when these poems were written, but I do
believe that Lavinia was being less than honest when she said that she
was not aware of ED's poetry early on.  My opinion is that ED, LD, and
AD  spoke and wrote Dickinsonesque language together in various degrees
of linguistic complexity, but that the patterns were perhaps held in
common.  Jess

Jim Goldberg, photographer/artist/wordsmith - a SF colleague & member of Magnum
- has done some extraordinary work exploring and artfully documenting that
terrain of migrants that includes those who have been sex trafficked, or are
economic or political refugees from a radius that includes Russia, north Africa
& India. I bring Jim's work up because much of it intimately lives within that
nerve center from which these eruptions around the Mediterranean are flying more
than ever into public consciousness. I think it's right on and into the geist of
that zone in which your own country ceases to exist.


You may have seen Goldberg's work exhibited in London, France and Italy during
the last couple of years. Steidl published his  "Open See", a boxed set of four
books, now going into a second printing. Or, for a quick sense, you can see the
work posted on Magnum website.

American Deadness is a manuscript in progress. Parts have appeared or are
forthcoming in Mipo, Miporadio, and Milk Magazine.

American Deadness is about the recession, and about the vast wilderness America
has become: the places, the spaces, and how they affect the ordinary people who
inhabit.

An mp3 of Pt.1 is up here:

Three new books from Junction Press, and a big sale. See the website, Junct=
ionpress.com, for more details about the books.

Jerome Rothenberg, Retrievals:Uncollected & New Poems, 1955-2010. Discount =
price $17

A central figure of both the "deep image" and ethnopoetics movements, and a=
 pioneering experimentalist, Jerome Rothenberg is the author of over eighty=
 collections of poems and ten volumes of translations and editor of nine gr=
ound-breaking anthologies. He here assembles, out of poems and plays unpubl=
ished or obscurely published, the first representation of the full trajecto=
ry of one of the most important careers in American poetry of the past fift=
y years.

"Jerome Rothenberg has done as much as anyone over the past half century to=
 shake up received ideas of what poems ought to be like, by demonstrating o=
r suggesting an endless profusion of other pathways, other shapes, other st=
ances, other contexts: as if to say that it is always possible to begin ove=
r, to invent new rules for the most ancient of games, not once but over and=
 over. Now to the rest of his poetry--a body of work still underrated, in p=
art because his extraordinary work as editor and translator may at times ha=
ve overshadowed it--is added this bonus: half a century of work previously =
uncollected, spilling out in profusion from the interstices of all the prev=
ious poetry and revealing multiple layers of exploration and invention. Her=
e are baroque sonnets, gnostic hymns, language games, parables, elegies, co=
nversations, landscapes inner and outer, dream poems, poems noisy and nearl=
y silent, poems mournful and ecstatic and uproarious, poems in dialogue wit=
h other poems from the Bablyonians and Toltecs to today or the day after, b=
y way of Oppian, Lorca, Pound, Duncan, Mac Low, and culminating in a starkl=
y pared-down suite of Ikons & Altarpieces. Retrievals is the book of a life=
, and the book of an era."
    - Geoffrey O'Brien, editor-in-chief, The Library of America


Rochelle Owens, Solitary Workwoman. Discount price $17

"Rochelle Owens' writing...is sui generis. She is, in many ways, a proto-la=
nguage poet, her marked ellipses, syntactic oddities, and dense and clashin=
g verbal surfaces recalling the long poems of Bruce Andrews and Ron Sillima=
n. But Owens is angrier, more energetic, and more assertive than most of he=
r Language counterparts, male and female, and she presents herself as curio=
usly non-introspective. Hers is a universe of stark gesture, lightning flas=
h, and uncompromising judgement: it is imperative, in her poetic world, to =
face up to the horror, even as the point of view is flexible enough to avoi=
d all dogmatism."
    - Marjorie Perloff

=E2=80=9CSharp & visual, Owens combines a landscape with a poetics, the dom=
estic with the mythic, machines with the organic living world--from which a=
rises a construct & a fused vision: poetry & life."
    - Jerome Rothenberg

=E2=80=9COwens goes cold turkey on the agony and delight of living in this =
century. She is the Shaman-genius exploring deeper realities in the psychic=
 realm. She reaches down into the living, breathing mystical core and pulls=
 up the forces of chaos spitting and kicking: she gives us back the hungry =
power of our own imaginations."
    - Maureen Owen

A central figure in the international vanat-garde for fifty years, Rochelle=
 Owens has published 16 previous volumes of poetry, including New and Selec=
ted Poems: 1961-1996 and Luca: Discourse on Life and Death (both Junction P=
ress, 1997 and 2001). She has been the recipient of five Village Voice Obie=
 awards and Honors from the New York Drama Critics' Circle for her plays. H=
er work has been translated into French, German, Italian, Spanish, Ukranian=
 and Japanese.


Polkinhorn and Velasco, Cal=C3=B3: A Dictionary of Spanish Barrio and Borde=
r Slang. Discount price $17

"This dictionary is a much-needed update of the slang of California's borde=
r region. While Chicano cal=C3=B3 has been recognized as a youth argot sinc=
e before World War II, when its speakers were known as pachucos, each regio=
n and generation has added new words and phrases, its speakers adapting the=
 dialect to their current reality. By using it, Chicano youths and other in=
siders sometimes hide their true intent, playing with language and at the s=
ame time paying homage to the camaradas who have gone before them. Cal=C3=
=B3: A Dictionary of Spanish Barrio & Border Slang allows the uninitiated i=
nto a world of living on the edge. It will be invaluable to readers who hav=
e learned Spanish in school but want to know how it's spoken on the street.=
"
    - MaryEllen Garc=C3=ADa, PhD, Department of Modern Languages and Litera=
tures, The University of Texas at San Antonio

"Cal=C3=B3 is a vibrant and often joyous explosion of linguistic tricksteri=
sm. Depending on the listener, it can either be delightful or intimidating-=
-sometimes both at once. This book is fascinating and hilarious. So put on =
your best calcos, grab your weesa, and take the ranfla out for a cruise--an=
d keep this volume in the glove box."
    - Luis Alberto Urrea, author of Into the Beautiful North, The Devil's H=
ighway, and The Hummingbird's Daughter.

"Polkinhorn and Velasco have busted the borders of linguistic analysis and =
Chicano talk assumptions. I hear the voices of my uncle Beto from El Paso i=
n the 30's, the new multi-vocalities of the "=C2=A1Orale!" generations of L=
atin America and the ever swashbuckling cross-cultural speakers and singers=
 of the world. This is the unchained rap of the people! Tune into its poeti=
c-love, community-renaissance and heart-rhythm dance. A twenty-first centur=
y ring-tone. =C2=A1De aquellas! Right on!"
    - Juan Felipe Herrera=20


Order direct from me for a discount. Each retails for $21, but is discounte=
d to $17 for list members. Order all three for $45. Add $3 for one book for=
 shipping within the US.

Still more ways to save money. Junction Press is digitalizing its older boo=
ks and needs to unburden its warehouse of remaining copies of books printed=
 offset. The digital copies will be significantly more expensive because of=
 increased paper costs. So,

Pay full price for Solitary Workwoman and I'll include Owens' New and Selec=
ted Poems 1961-1996 and Luca: Discourse on Life and Death gratis (each reta=
il for $20).=20

Buy any of the new books at full price and select one of the following grat=
is:
Richard Elman, Cathedral-Tree-Train
Luisa Futoransky, translated by Jason Weiss, The Duration of the Voyage
Mark Weiss, Fieldnotes
Ira Beryl Brukner, Questions, Short Poems, Water & Air
Susie Mee, The Undertaker's Daughter
Stephen Vincent, Walking

Finally, Across the Line / Al otro lado: The Poetry of Baja California (bil=
ingual, edited by Polkinhorn and Weiss), $10 (retail price $25).

All of these offerings are only available backchannel to me.

Happy book buying.

Dear all:
A musicologist friend has sent me the following query and I told him I'd
forward it to the poetics list.
You can reply back-channel (to me) on the list, and I'll forward the
responses to him. Thanks, all.

Hi Maria,

I have a geeky scholarly question for you.  Have you come across the term
"phonomontage" much in your field, especially in dealing with text-sound
poetry/composition?  Let me know; it's a term I'm interested in
appropriating for some of my ringtones, but I'd like to know if it has a
relatively stable meaning or set of meanings in scholarship on poetry.

Cheers,
Sumanth

I had not heard the term "phonomontage" before, though it is a 'natural', so
I googled it. Google gave me search results for "photomontage" instead. I
had to go to the "advanced search" page and specify "this exact wording or
phrase" to get results for "phonomontage".

Several of the initial results referred to "Joseph Hammer, an influential
artist in the LA sound-art scene for more than twenty-five years. Drawing on
the complexities of playing, listening, memory and time, his sample based
piece used a vintage reel tape player to manipulate handmade loops
controlled manually into a complex 'phonomontage'."

The poet Karl Krauss also is mentioned: "Kraus's most characteristic work
was produced in wartime, and the most important of his plays, the monumental
but virtually unperformable "phonomontage" Die letzten Tage der Menschheit
(1922; The Last Days of Mankind, English abridgments, 1974, 1976), may be
the most powerful pacifistic statement ever made."

Interesting to me is the reference to "phonomontage" in an essay by Nicholas
Zurbrugg called "Marinetti, Boccioni, and Electroacoustic Poetry". He says,
concerning Larry Wendt, the terrific audio poet/writer, "In the same
interview, Wendt explained that the use of computers and
microprocessors facilitates the production of what we have termed
 "reel-time"
effects (or studio editing, previously achieved laboriously, in sequential
"phonomontages" combining layer after layer of sound), in real time, as
relatively spontaneous "phonomontage." As Wendt intimates, such creativity
adds yet another "language" to electroacoustic poetry."

And this sort of context--amid the work of the audio writers--is where I
would expect the term 'phonomontage' to appear, really, concerning poetry.
It's in the work of the audio writers such as Larry Wendt, Bernard
Heidsieck, Henri Chopin, Gregory Whitehead, and Douglas Kahn that it makes
the most intuitive sense to me that the term would appear. Because they were
indeed doing aural montages of very many different types. Using the
technology of recorded sound.

I used to play the work of all these cats on a literary radio show I
produced in the 80's and early nineties.

Hi Lori,

although I think that the answers above are meaningful and add to the
understanding of Steve's 'concrete poetry' if you look at the following:

Exemplo destas propostas pode ser encontrado no poema *Terra* de *D=E9cio
Pignatari*:

ra terra ter
rat erra ter
rate rra ter
rater ra ter
raterr a ter
raterra terr
araterra ter
raraterra te
rraraterra t
erraraterra
terraraterra

Observe-se o despojamento e o jogo verbal deste poema de *Haroldo de Campos=
*
:

de sol a sol
soldado
de sal a sal
salgado
de sova a sova
sovado
de suco a suco
sugado
de sono a sono
sonado

sangrado
de sangue a sangue

Os recursos visuais

Os recursos visuais s=E3o utilizados por *Augusto de Campos* como no poema
abaixo entitulado *Eis os amantes*:

COLOCAR EIS OS AMANTES

Em *P=F3s-tudo*, escrito no fim da d=E9cada de 80, Augusto de Campos parece
fazer o invent=E1rio de sua participa=E7=E3o no concretismo, identificando =
o seu
papel nas mudan=E7as po=E9ticas e reconhecendo que o caminho revolucion=E1r=

COLOCAR POEMA P=D3S =96TUDO

Taken from this site of Literatura Brasileira under poesia concreta:

http://educaterra.terra.com.br/literatura/litcont/2003/04/22/001.htm

then we can easily get to the idea of 'dirty concrete'_ any kind of poetry
which is 'concrete' but not that neatly formatted, nor that
orderly/logically formulated.

MIME-Version: 1.0

PLEASE REPOST!

We are now accepting submissions for Omnia Vanitas Review's upcoming
second issue: =93Operatic Veils.=94

Omnia Vanitas Review is a delicate mixture of F=E9minine =C9criture, New
Narrative, and Clit Lit. We enjoy explicit descriptions of sex written
in white ink. Deflowering language. Multiple orgasms with multiple
climaxes. The playful touching of intertextuality. Deliberately
elusive linguistic weavings. Words who slow dance with Aphasia and
flirt with Amnesia. Words wet with formlessness. Words pregnant with
child. With twins, with quintuplets.

Esoterica. Etcetera. Erotica.

Though we consider ourselves an erotica magazine, we also interpret
=93erotica=94 rather loosely. We think of the act of writing=97words
penetrating the void, pen piercing paper=97as an erotic endeavor, and
though some of our submissions are transparently risqu=E9, we can=92t
think of anything more racy than the pure desire to write.

This can be interpreted in an infinite number of ways, however, only
the ways that suit us best will be considered for publication. We are
interested in defining, defiling, and defending barriers. We are
interested in operas, mechanical operations, and operational
machinations. We like layers upon layers of everything and words
richer than cream. And we love literature that skirts the edges of
what language can do.

Please take a look at our previous issue, =93The Invisible Corset,=94 to
get an idea of what we=92re looking for:  http://omniavanitasreview.com

We will be considering poetry, fiction, creative-nonfiction, essays,
as well as both visual and video art, though some of the latter pieces
may only be featured on the website (for obvious reasons). We are also
considering works in other languages besides English, or bilingual
works, with a specific interest in French.

Please send all submissions to Omnia.Vanitas.Review@gmail.com

Please include the word "submission" in the subject line.

Multiple submissions are okay, but send each submission as an
individual Microsoft Word documents (.docx okay) or PDF email
attachment.

Deadline to be included in our =93Operatic Veils=94 Issue: The Ides of
March, 2011 (late submissions possibly ok)

As we are an aspiring literary journal, we regretfully are unable to
pay our authors, but what we lack in cash we make up for in love.

We look forward to hearing from you!

Sincerely,
Catherine Borders, Oleander Underhill, and Lily Robert-Foley

Omnia Vanitas Review is always open to submissions of previously
unpublished works. Currently, we are an annual publication, but our
fingers are crossed for expansion. We are a small operation, and will
do our best to respond to you promptly.

We have just learned that our beloved friend, poet, teacher, performer,
activist, mother, sister, Akilah Oliver passed away in her home in the Fort
Greene section of Brooklyn, N.Y.


Akilah Oliver was born in 1961 in L.A. In the 1990's she founded and performed
with the feminist performance collective Sacred Naked Nature Girls. For several
years, Akilah lived and raised her son Oluchi McDonald (1982-2003) in Boulder,
Colorado where she was a teacher at Naropa University's Jack Kerouac School of
Disembodied Poetics. Recently, in New York City, Akilah taught poetry and
writing at Eugene Lang College, The New School, Pratt Insitute and The Poetry
Project. She was a PhD candidate at The European Graduate School and a member of
the Belladonna* Collaborative.

Akilah Oliver's books include A Toast In The House of Friends (Coffee House
2009), the she said dialogues: flesh memory, a book of experimental prose poetry
honored by the PEN American Center's "Open Book" program, and the chapbooks An
Arriving Guard of Angels, Thusly Coming to Greet (Farfalla, McMillan & Parrish,
2004), The Putterer's Notebook (Belladonna 2006), a(A)ugust (Yo-Yo Labs, 2007)
and A Collection of Objects (Tente 2010). She read and performed her work
throughout the country as a solo artist and with a variety of musicians and
collaborators including Tyler Burba, Anne Waldman, and Rasul Siddik. She was a
artist in residence at Beyond Baroque Literary Arts Center in Los Angeles, and
received grants from the California Arts Council, The Flintridge Foundation and
the Rockefeller Foundation. Among her many other projects, she was writing a
book-length theory of lamentation.

Information about services and memorial will be forthcoming.

We are collecting funds for Akilah's funeral expenses and to support activity to
keep the memory of Akilah and her work alive! These contributions are tax
deductible and can be made through Ether Sea Projects. Please include Akilah's
name in the subject line if you are sending a check.

To expand a little on my last post, I'd say that though the term
'phonomontage' is not one I've heard before, it's a natural concerning the
work of the audio writers, who may have used it--it sounds like Larry Wendt
used it, in any case, to judge from its appearance in
http://tinyurl.com/6bt8zp3

Larry Wendt, John Giorno, William S Burroughs, Bernard Heidsieck, Henri
Chopin, Gregory Whitehead, Rod Summers, Susan Stone, Douglas Kahn,
blackhumour, Matt Fair, and various other artists were/are poets/writers who
take the medium of recorded sound seriously as compositional media.

Check out, for instance, some of the first work by Gregory Whitehead at
http://www.ubu.com/sound/whitehead.html . These are simply brilliant "audio
cut-ups".

Some of my own interactive audio cut up/phonomontage work is at
http://vispo.com/mw , http://vispo.com/animisms/enigman2 , and
http://vispo.com/stevens . You need the Shockwave plugin from
http://vispo.com/sw to play these. The first one, http://vispo.com/mw ,
requires some curiosity to play with the controls of the interface that
appear at the bottom of the screen. The controls are not explained at all.
But if you play with the spin control to change the number displayed, you
see that changes the sound quite a bit if you change that number quite a
bit. The second piece, http://vispo.com/animisms/enigman2 , is interactive
with the word "meaning" backwards once, forwards twice.

"...if [phonomontage] has a relatively stable meaning or set of meanings in
scholarship on poetry..."

My guess (supported by a brief google search) is that the short answer is:
No.

Phonomontage implies multiple voices, interruption of one voice by another,
or use of editing for one voice to interrupt itself, complete disconnection
of signifier from signified, found (vocal) sound, etc -- rare in cont Am
poetry I think, which, despite all, clings tenaciously to sense. (Human
minds after all are meaning-making machines, though human beings are not.
And there's the rub.) I'd be interested to hear if others know of a
poet/poets who use phonomontage (ergo this msg frontchannel).

I'd also love to know what happened at Black Mountain College in
conversations between Cage & Olson. My guess is that Olson basically said,
"This man's ideas shall have no place in poetry." Yet Cage, in my opinion,
is the greater poet. Not only because his lectures are more interesting
studies of word arrangements in time, but because his ideas will be more
enduring. Is there any record of what passed between them?
