I'm working on a project involving dead women poets of NYC and
NYState and would appreciate any names, locales, works, etc. (they
don't all have to be Elizabeth Bishop & Marianne Moore).
Reply can be sent to UB poetics or wordthur@catskill.net.  Thanks.

  I was going to rib you: how can someone with taste, judgment, freedom and an
artistic instinct be independent? The deck's loaded! But then I remembered that
we are family -par-alliance -- your Mandelstam being brother to my Celan, the
poet who has been riding me  for 30 years now & who's work gives a yardstick
measure re poems-vs.-gab: Celan left slightly under a 1000 poems (oh, let's be
pedantic: 974 exactly) while the Collected Prose (2 speeches/poetic statements,
an early intro to a painter, a philosophical fiction & a few very small
statements in answer to queries) comes to 55 pages -- if you use a largish font.
There is also some 1000 pages of poetry translated into German from half a dozen
languages: this work and the choice of poets PC chose to translate I take as a
more real critical evaluation of poetry thna any number of crit-gab tomes. And,
btw, it is always in Celan's translation that I read Mandelstam, not having
Russian. -- Pierre

 Katy -- much of that thinking goes back to Pound, I believe, trying in the early
part of the century to clean out the Augian stables of Victorian/ Edwardian poetry &
their superabundance of mellifluous multisyllabic latinate words by replacing them
with sharp brief anglo-saxon ones. The revenge of the latins of course came in the
seventies when frog-theory hopped the Atlantic Pond and nested on the lotus leaves
of US academia. -- Pierre

Mandelstam said he wrote not for his contemporaries but for the unknown
interlocutor of the future; I think you could say the same for Celan.  They
wrote poetry for Poetry.  I can imagine a person out there who writes
criticism for Poetry.  The original framers of a subjective set of standards
(OM's, Celan's yardstick) may only be ghosts; but this imaginary critic
will understand Criticism itself as a genre with certain laws of its own,
the first being "keep your distance".

I realize my past few posts on this thread have set up an unrealistic
ideal, and that poets have every right to be critics too, and scholars will
probably write the best reviews, and critics have every natural right to
review the work that really GRABS them.  But at the core should be the
fresh air of independent judgement, or critical self-respect.  We should
listen for those chimes of freedom & try to bring them forward, rather than
march on in the endless grind of marginal/mainstream, tradition/experiment,
my group/their group, your hustle/my failure, my publish/your tenure,
tendentious business as usual. Criticism can be an art form too, if and
when it's brave enough to look at poetry as something other than a
career or a kind of translated politics.  "Man shall not live by bread
alone but by every word that proceeds from the mouth of God."

Henry, I couldn't agree with you more.  However, the program you sketch out is
as political as it gets; the difficulties arise, as I'm sure you know,
whenever one attempts to determine which god is saying what.

                                Above the world-weary horizons

                                New obstacles for exchange arise

                                Or unfold, O ye postmasters!



1. About the Poetics List


The Poetics List was founded in late 1993 with the epigraph above.


There are presently almost 600 subscribers.


Please note that this is a private list and information about the list
should not be posted to other lists or directories of lists. The idea is
to keep the list to those with specific rather than general interests,
and also to keep the scale of the list relatively small and the volume
manageable.


The Poetics List, while committed to openness, is moderated. While
individual posts of participants are sent directly to all subscribers, we
continue to work to promote the editorial function of this project. The
definition of that project, while provisional, and while open to
continual redefinition by list participants, is nonetheless aversive to a
generalized discussion of poetry. Rather, our aim is  to support, inform,
and extend those directions in poetry that are committed to innovations,
renovations, and investigations of form and/or/as content, to the
questioning of received forms and styles, and to the creation of the
otherwise unimagined, untried, unexpected, improbable, and impossible.
**<color><param>ffff,0000,0000</param>We also encourage subscribers to
post information on publications and reading series that they have
coordinated, edited, published, or in which they appear (see section 9
below).** (THIS MEANS *YOU*).

</color>

Please keep in mind that all posts go out immediately to all subscribers,
and become part of an on-line archive. *<italic>Posting to Poetics is a
form of publication, not personal communication</italic>.* Participants
are asked to exercise caution before posting messages! While spontaneity
of response may seem the very heart of the list at its best, it also has
the darker side of circulating ideas that have not been well considered
(or considered by another reader -- editor or friend). Given the nature
of the medium, subscribers do well to maintain some skepticism when
reading the list and, where possible, to try to avoid taking what may be
something close to a spontaneous comment made in the heat of exchange as
if it were a revised or edited essay ("Let the Reader Beware!").=20


The "list owner" of Poetics is Charles Bernstein. Joel Kuszai is list
manager.  For subscription information contact us at
POETICS@acsu.buffalo.edu.


___________________________________________________________


2. Subscriptions


Subscriptions to Poetics are free of charge. But we ask that you
subscribe with your real name and we reserve the right to request
additional information, including address and phone number. All
subscription information you supply will remain confidential.


You can subscribe (sub) or unsubscribe (unsub) by sending a one-line
message, with no subject line, to:


listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu


the one-line message should say:


unsub poetics


{or}


sub poetics Jill Jillway


(replacing Jill Jillway with your own name; but note: do not use your

name to unsub)


We will be sent a notice of all subscription activity. Please allow
several days for your new or re-subscription to take effect.=20


*


If you are having difficulty unsubscribing, please note:


Sometimes your e-mail address may be changed slightly by your system
administrator.  If this happens you will not be able to send messages to
Poetics or to unsubscribe, although you will continue to get your Poetics
mail.  To avoid this, unsub from the old address and resub from the new
address.  If you can no longer do this there is a solution if you use
Eudora (an e-mail program that is available free at shareware sites):
from the Tools menu select "Options" and then select set-up for "Sending
Mail": you may be able to substitute your old address here and send the
unsub message.


The most frequent problem with subscriptions is bounced messages. If your
system is often down or if you have a low disk quota, Poetics messages
may get bounced.  Please try avoid having messages from the list returned
to us. If the problem is low disk quota, you may wish to request an
increase from your system administrator. (You may wish to argue that this
subscription is part of your scholarly communication!) You may also wish
to consider obtaining a commercial account.


In general, if a Poetics message is bounced from your account, your
subscription to Poetics will be temporarily suspended. If this happens,
simply resubscribe to the list in the normal manner, once your account
problem has been resolved.


All questions about subscriptions, whether about an individual
subscription or subscription policy, should be addressed to the list's
administrative address: poetics@acsu.buffalo.edu. Please note that it may
take up to ten days, or more, for us to reply to messages.=20

____________________________________________________________________


3.  Cautions


Please do not post to the list personal or backchannel correspondence, or
other unpublished material, without the express permission of the author.
Copyright for all material posted on Poetics remains with the author;
material from this list and its archive may not be reproduced without the
author's permission, beyond the standard rights accorded by "fair use".


The Poetics List has a 50 message daily limit. If more than 50 messages
are received, the listserver will automatically hold those additional
messages until the list is manually unlocked, usually the following day.
While it is difficult to prescribe a set limit on the number of daily,
weekly, or monthly posts for any  subscriber, please keep this limit in
mind. If you plan to respond to multiple threads, it is generally
preferable to consolidate your reply into one message. While relevant
excerpts from a post to which you are responding may usefully be appended
to your reply, please do not include in your new post the whole text of a
long previously posted message.


Please do not send attachments or include extremely long documents in a
post, since this may make it difficult for those who get the list via
"digest" or who cannot decode attached or specially formatted files.=20


In addition to being archived at the EPC, some posts to Poetics
(especially reviews, obituary notices, announcements, etc.) may also
become part of specific EPC subject areas. Brief reviews of poetry events
and publications are always welcome. (See section 7.)


Please do not send inquiries to the list to get an individual subscribers
address. To get this information, see section 6.


If you want someone to send out information to the list as a whole, or
supply information missing from an post, or thank someone for posting
something you requested, please send the request or comment to the
individual backchannel, not to the whole list.=20


____________________________________________________________________


4. Digest Option


The Listserve program gives you he option to receive all the posted
Poetics message each day as a single message. If you would prefer to
receive ONE message each day, which would include all messages posted to
the list for that day, you can use the digest option.  Send this one-line
message (no subject line) to


                                listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu


set poetics digest


NOTE:!! Send this message to "listserv" not to Poetics or as a reply

to this message!!


You can switch back to individual messages by sending this message:


set poetics mail

____________________________________________________________________


5. Temporarily turning off Poetics mail


Do not leave your Poetics subscription "active" if you are going to be
away for any extended period of time! Your account may become flooded and
you may lose not only Poetics messages but other important mail. You can
temporarily turn off your Poetics subscription by sending a message to
"listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu"


set poetics nomail


& turn it on again with: set poetics mail


When you return you can check or download missed postings from the
Poetics

archive. (See 8 below.)


____________________________________________________________________


6. Who's Subscribed


To see who is subscribed to Poetics, send an e-mail message to
listserv@listserv.acsu.buffalo.edu; leave the "Subject" line of the
e-mail message blank.  In the body of your e-mail message type:


  review poetics


You will be sent within a reasonable amount of time (by return e-mail) a
rather long list containing the names and e-mail addresses of Poetics
subscribers.  This list is alphabetized by server not name.


 or try:


 review POETICS by name

 review POETICS by country


which will give you the list alphabetically by name or a flawed list by
country (since all ".com" and ".net"s are counted as US)


*Please do not send a message to the list asking for the address of a
specific subscriber.*

____________________________________________________________________


7. What is the Electronic Poetry Center?


our URL is


http://writing.upenn.edu/epc


The mission of this World-Wide Web based electronic poetry center is to
serve as a hypertextual gateway to the extraordinary range of activity in
formally innovative writing in the United States and the world.  The
Center provides access to the burgeoning number of electronic resources
in the new poetries including RIF/T and other electronic poetry journals,
the POETICS List archives, an AUTHOR library of electronic poetic texts,
and direct connections to numerous related electronic RESOURCES. The
Center also provides information about contemporary print little
magazines and SMALL PRESSES engaged in poetry and poetics. And we have an
extensive collection of soundfiles of poets' reading their work, as well
as the archive of LINEbreak, the radio interview series.


The EPC is directed by Loss Peque=F1o Glazier.

____________________________________________________________________


8. Poetics Archives via EPC


Go to the EPC and select Poetics from the opening screen. Follow the
links to Poetics Archives. You may browse the archives by month and year
or search them for specific information. Your interface will allow you to
print or download any of these files.


Or set your browser to go directly to:

http://writing.upenn.edu/epc/poetics/archive


____________________________________________________________________


9. Publishers & Editors Read This!


PUBLISHERS & EDITORS: Our listings of poetry and poetics information is
open and available to you. We are trying to make access to printed
publications as easy as possible to our users and ENCOURAGE you to
participate! Send a list of your press/publications to
glazier@acsu.buffalo.edu with the words EPC Press Listing in the subject
line. You may also send materials on disk. (Write file name, word
processing program, and Mac or PC on disk.) Send an e-mail message to the
address above to obtain a mailing address to which to send your disk.
Though files marked up with html are our goal, ascii files are perfectly
acceptable. If yourword processor ill save files in Rich Text Format
(.rtf) this is also highly desirable


Send us extended information on new publications (including any back
cover copy and sample poems) as well as complete catalogs/backlists
(including excerpts from reviews, sample poems, etc.).  Be sure to
include full information for ordering--including prices and addresses and
phone numbers both of the press and any distributors.


Initially, you might want to send short anouncements of new publications
directly to the Poetics list as subscribers do not always (or ever) check
the EPC; in your message please include full information for ordering.=20
If you have a fuller listing at EPC, you might also mention that in any
Poetics posts.


Some announcements circulated through Poetics and the EPC have received a
noticeable responses; it may be an effective way to promote your
publication and we are glad to facilitate information about interesting
publications.

There's a review in the NY Times Bk Review today of a new biography of Keats
by Andrew Motion. The reviewer quotes some good examples of the "savaging"
Keats took at the hands of the "indie-critics" of his time.  That adds another
layer of complexity to my modest proposal: Indie critics becoming an
Institution.

Another point the review makes is that Motion's earlier book on Philip Larkin
did not idealize Larkin BECAUSE Motion knew him personally.  That adds a 2nd
layer of difficulty to my proposal.

But I don't think you have to worry about the inescapable politics of
subjectivity or objectivity.  You just have to believe in the thin silver
rope that dangles down from Poetry to the indie-critic.  And of course, the
only God of Poetry is Keats's Psyche. (I heard she joined the CP in 1924,
was ostracized for "unwise associations" in 1926, fled to Zembla in 1928,
escaped with Kinbote (Charles II of Zembla) in 1930, became a New Critic
in 1932, became an Old Critic in 1934, converted to Catholicism in 1936,
went to Poland in 1938, converted to Judaism in 1940, lived in Cracow
until...) and lives under a pseudonym - Marie Czinski - in Chicago to this
day, where she runs a day care center and writes for the Drawer.

terrific flurry of writing posted by names that are all new to me on this
list.  welcome! and keep posting!  the sheer quantity of posts, plus the
intensity of recent activities here in loveley london ontario has forced
me into lurkdom.  we had a reading monday night ("poetry in lotion" --
kevin hehir has his series up and running here again), roy miki and ashok
mathur joined frank davey et al. were here for a tribute to roy kiyooka on
tuesday, then we had a weekend of readings/performances here this weekend:
on friday, terri rowan from trent university, susan elmslie and masarah
vaneyck from mcgill, theresa smalec from calgary/london, peter jaeger read
from strech conflates (new out from tailspin; review forthcoming), and i
gave my first reading yesterday in almost a year, from which i'm still
buzzin...

By the way, that first word isn't a typo. It's just that most of the
discourse on this list has been awfully transparent lately. I was only
trying to call attention to the materiality of language. Or something like
htat.

Don't you hate it when somebody says something vaguely provocative (or
provocatively vague) and then just leaves? Well, an hour after my last post
to the list I was ordered "to hospital" and have just returned, stuffed with
strange new antibiotics and a couple of days of breathing oxygen and many,
many exotic tests (all of which were negative, happily). There were just
under 80 email messages awaiting me, mostly because the digest option of
Poetics telescoped 150 into three.

Matt, Rod, et al, I may have over or mal-construed Jeff Derksen in my
previous message but even at the talk I was trying to articulate in my own
words what I took as the gist of his argument, where I am no doubt also
doing some appropriations.

Tom, Kent, references:

Steven Johnson, Interface Culture: How New Technlogy Transforms the Way We
Create and Communicate (Harper/Edge, 1997). Johnson went to Brown where he
studied semiotics, then Columbia to study lit. Feed is at either
www.feed.com or www.feedmag.com.

Manuel Castells is by training an urban planner (folks of a certain age in
SF will recall that I brought him to Langton to talk during the period when
he was advising what was then a new socialist regime in his native Spain).
There's a big 3 volume series in progress (two books published), called The
Information Age: Economy, Society and Culture. Vol. 1 The Rise of the
Network Society. Vol. 2 The Power of Identity. Both available from
Blackwell.

I was reading around Absence Sensorium today and agree with Tom totally
about Dan.

i'm very touched by this and other "personal" (but not creepily so, in my
book) testimonials to one aspect of the fabric of the innner life vis a vis
writing that gets ver short shrift on the list in general --the stories of
silences, pains and struggles, material conditions (AIDS, childrearing,
personal disappointments and losses, etc) that make the writing life not
solely about "being productive" or being a good poet or a bad critic.  gary
s, i appreciate your question (what can i, maria, do to rectify the gender
and race etc imbalance in the academy) but i must confess to having started
a long post that got reactive and defensive, to the tune of "I'm dancing as
fast as i can", and i can't do everything i'd like to do, etc. so the
martyry, victimy tone crept in, and that's another story.  thanks

well gary, there's a lot i can do (beyond trying to get readers to come) to
try to get my institution to reflect a racial and gender balance. i can
(and do) teach courses that represent these interests. when i'm on
admissions committees or in positions of power vis a vis hiring or
admissions, i can (and do) advocate for this balance.  when i serve on
prelim or dissertation committees i can (and try to) influence the
students' scholarship to include these matters.  i exist  in the academy,
which means i am a woman in the academy, which means i represent different
things to different people, hopefully some of them good.  as for bringing
specific poets out or trying to get 'em published, i can (and do) do that
too.  i can (and do) recommend projects i know of to the editors at the
presses, both literary and academic, here. i could always do more, but as
you may or may not know i am a person of limited energy.   so i have to
take it pretty easy.   i do all the things i know to do, which i also
believe to be within my capacity, and needless to say it's never enough.

Since I tend to agree with Laura about just about everything, I won't take
issue with her=8Band I do think that there are complex reasons for people to
write or not to write, and that it can get tedious, people blaming others
for their inabilities to succeed.  When I moved to the Bay Area in the late
70s, which was really the beginning of my becoming a writer, feminists told
me that the language poets were domineering patriarchs.  The queer scene
told me that the language poets were domineering homophobes.  And I saw
many a poet try to get into those lofty ranks and fail, like a moth
throwing itself at a light.  Many of them ended up feeling burned--some of
them were associated with the very magazines, "Jimmy & Lucy's House of K,
Big Allis, and Ottotole," that Laura notes were publishing at the time.
[Dan Davidson came to all this later on--I'm talking the early 80s before
Dan was on the writing scene.]

As far as who gained entry among the younger poets, looking back, there was
a certain babe factor.  Young attractive women such as Sandra Meyer and
Johanna Jordahl seemed to be swept up in the beneficient arms of the group
(to the dismay, I was told, of some of its female members).  It seems to me
that it was the young male poets who had the hardest time of it--like Daddy
was never going to say, "Come be my equal."  No way.

Because I was developing a new kind of prose that I could exist within, I
was mostly outside of this drama.  When I first moved here, Tillie Olsen
was much on the scene and there was endless discussion about her book
_Silences_, which, for those of you not familiar with old feminist books,
is about the reasons women stop writing, with lots of emphasis on Tillie's
own life, how her role as Woman kept her from writing for years.  There's
this one story of hers that everybody read and talked about, about ironing
her family's wash, and this idea that ironing somehow kept women from
writing was a big image.  A few years ago I was talking with someone who
knew Tillie Olsen when she was young, and this person brought up the
ironing story and said that Tillie never ironed, that her kids were always
dirty with wrinkled clothes.  My mother, who likes to go on about the
condition of the kitchen floors of the various people she knows--the
ultimate compliment being "so clean you could eat off of it"--my mother
would have been shocked by Tillie Olsen.

Recently I was at a dinner with a number of the older writers here in SF
and a few of the younger writers, and the olders writers were entertaining
the younger writers with battle stories of the poetry wars of the late 70s,
early 80s.  Some of them were outrageously funny.  Memory is retrospective
and we all remember things differently.  I remember things differently than
Kevin, for example--and from Laura and Tom and Gary as well.  And many of
my "memories" are handed down to me from others' confidences.  Katy's
received version may be myth, but like all myths, there's some truth to it.
I hope someday that a social historian will write the story of the poetry
wars.

considered, but rejected with sincere amusement.  Indomitable, value
                ridden eminence to raze, even to joy;
                yet furlongs wider than her hate stretches.

Katy, epistemological breakthroughs aside, 'best works' aside, those short
words are mighty interesting. For one, they're Anglo Saxon: house, boat,
wood, rock, ice, water, man, woman, fire.... They are the things of this
world, and were created in a far different time, out of far different
impulses than current word-making. They share that, though: word-making.
So, it's not that different at all. Now, whether or not one abandons that
particular old sense of the world as discrete hunks of spirit and matter
shuffled magically around, it is still there. The rest of the language has
only acreted around it, as do the products of any innovative methodology we
dream up. Those little old words can be approached and reseen with a new
methodology. Celan does that. I'd say that was an equally fruitful path: to
meet that vision head on.

David. Thanks for the post and the oppotunity to elaborate. Both
modernism and postmodernism for me legitimate themselves by presenting
modes for addressing conditions which engage other segments of the
culture, be they psychoanalytic, scientific, philosophical, political,
sociological etc. This I find to be the chief value of both. What
distinguishes modernism is its treatment of fragmentation and
specialization that it saw rocking Europe during and after World War I
by attempting to remake culture in the poet's image. The moderns
attempted to either create a new synthesis and/or to reinvent what they
perceived as the old one. In fact there are both of these elements in
all the moderns because all the moderns implicitly understood the value
of historical context. The problem became to discover a new world within
the individual voice of each poet profound enough to compensate for the
what was perceived as the bankrupt condition of the world in which they
found themselves. There is nothing poetically unique in that except that
the moderns (at least the one's I'm thinking of here) used available
texts, literally anything they felt relevant, as their actual materials.
The thematic unity of David Jones' brilliant poems maintain a certain
structural continuity as well by primarily limiting themselves to
material from three historical sources. Olson on the other hand was at
home with historical shards seeing quite accurately that history itself
was only a jumble of fragments upon which any coherence was largely
imposed. Pound interests me most, not only because the Cantos are
probably the best of all the modernist works, but because even though he
more or less invented the modernist mode, possibly coming to certain
realizations as he edited Eliot's Ur-Wasteland, he was also ill-suited
temperamentally to the task of stanching the fragmentation of a culture.
Pound begins the Cantos in medias res almost as though coherence will
someday present itself out of the mists like Ithaca to the wandering
Greeks. I'm exaggerating a great deal here by ignoring the large poetic
and intellectual experience Pound brought to the Cantos, but it still
remains that he finally admitted that he could not make them cohere. It
was through this ethos of failure of the poem's thematic structure that
Pound made his most important discoveries and created the Cantos' most
enduring passages. In the end Pound even more profoundly than Olson
reflected our true historical condition by incorporating fragmentation
and failure in a work of art which in so many ways paralleled the
failure of his own personal history. Pound among all the modernists
became an historical figure for better or worse and did it, in part, by
resisting (to the point of madness) the unsculpturable lessons of his
own chosen materials in the end succumbing, like the Cantos, to the very
fragmentation he sought to overwhelm.
By the time we get to the PostModernist, Olson is their true Penelope
because we are prepared to accept the now overwhelmingly obvious
condition of fragmentation. This is utterly legitimate; in fact it shows
good sense. I'm just not certain that the role of poets is to show good
sense. In this era of 'good sense', scientific method, modelling (not of
the runway type), standardization, globalization, digitization etc.,
with all the dreams of the futurist's clean fascist lines realized,
poets will have little or no role to play. They will have no role no
matter how impeccably elegant their constructs, and no matter how much
hermeneutical precision they achieve, no matter how fashionable they
make formal and contextual randomness. Any solutions that I might
propose would of course embody personal thematic materials. But as with
all moderns this thematic material would not be restricted to my own
navel. I have more than hinted at some of my concerns in other posts to
this site and I intended to elaborate today but that would make this a
very long post indeed. I would just like to say that the current attacks
on some fifth generation academic heirs to some of the
'counterintuitive' conditions introduced over 80 years ago, should have
presented an opportunity for poets too. That it presented no opportunity
for those poets that support sciences purportedly pragmatic and
authoritarian side is no surprise; the juggernaut hardly needs them.
Among poets, individuals versed in the counterarguments are virtually
non-existent. Don Byrd's statement that "The only poetry that I know
that attempts to face this urgency [e.g. ecological disaster] is
sentimental and hopelessly naive" is true but not uncorrectable. Fish,
Aronowitz, Hayles et al aren't great; but they've hit upon some
legitimate concerns as you can judge from the vehement response among
the establishment; an establishment that fears history so much that it
positions itself so that it must ridicule and deny the philosophical
ruminations of the physicists that birthed their very enterprise. Seems
to have some elements of Greek tragedy with the postmodernist
philosophers as chorus?---Carlo Parcelli
P.S. I can connect the dots between formal systems and ecological
disaster but it ain't pretty.

Subject:      criticism rules
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII

        I'd like to second Rod Smith's post about the role of criticism in
the work of poets at the present moment--there's no doubt, whether Henry
thinks it's a cop-out or not, that having to teach 4-5 courses a semester
at three different universities, plus do editorial work on the side, in
order to provide myself with a fairly spartan existence does cut into the
time I have for writing of any kind--and I know many other poets who have
similar circumstances. Nonetheless, having been guilty of a few critical
pieces anyway, I'd like to raise some further points suggested by Rod's
post and Henry's responses to that and other matters.

        I think I would add to what Rod says that there is, among the
poets he mentions, not simply a reticence about critical writing (although
it is that in some cases) but actually a particular RESISTANCE to it that
may be important to note. While I think what Juliana Spahr says about the
greater attention to male language poets is certainly the case, I also
think another related issue is that of the attention afforded to poets who
write critically (whether in standard academic form or not) and those who
do not do so. With some (but few) exceptions, larger reputations (in the
academic world and elsewhere) have gone to those language writers who also
publish criticism. Note that, for instance, a poet like Susan Howe has a
much larger academic reputation than those, like Carla Harryman, who do
not. Indeed I think it's safe to say that for the most part, the attention
outside the world of poets that language writing has received has been due
more to its criticism than its poetry.

        This fact, I think, is a direct function of the increasing lack of
value placed by the academic world (and of course all of American culture)
on anything other than criticism. Indeed, in retrospect one might
say of language writing that its writers perceived the decreasing value of
writing poetry at all without a critical defense of its value, although at
the time it must have seemed that their use of philosphy, literary and
cultural theory was allowing them to call into question much of the
theoretically naive poetry of that time. But make no mistake: with few
exceptions, almost all academic interest in language poetry has come from
interest in its IDEAS, which the poetry, if you believe these takes, tends
to serve as a kind of vehicle for--language poetry becomes ABOUT the
materiality of language, an idea which critics can then discuss. Or poetry
serves as a vehicle for discussing IDEAS about social inequality. Such
ideas are of course valuable, but they are not the poetry itself, but
rather extractions from its engagements, always themselves larger than
simply the stating of ideas.

        Just as one recent for instance, the recent back-and-forth over
Ron's Philly Talks far exceeds any recent back-and-forth about
Ron's poetry. Poetry itself doesn't per se DEBATE, and therefore, despite
being the ostensible reason behind this list, nonetheless serves as an
often very shadowy other to what actually goes on here.

        All that said, I am not myself AGAINST criticism, and think that
much of value can be done with it, as long that one recognizes that to
engage in it is to engage with a cultural form that has increasing
dominance over poetry. Some writers have responded to this dominance by
alternative forms for criticism. But I think that for many of the poets
whom Rod mentions, it does not go too far to say that they have actively
rejected criticism of any form, as being, for the time in which they live,
a coercive form of domination which they intend to resist. Does such a
position go too far? Perhaps. Does it put them in the position of seeming
"anti-theoretical"? Also perhaps, although I think not. So it's not simply
lack of time, but in many cases REFUSAL to engage in a kind of writing
that, whatever its value, simply seems too polluted by its connection to
the active DENIGRATION of the writing they themselves love.

        I myself have chosen to write criticism for at least two reasons.
One is that there are things one worth saying, to me at least, in
criticism's possible
forms. And the other is, to be quite blunt, the recognition that if I do
not express ideas in their dominant form, I may be a short term contract
professor/editor for the rest of my life, that is until I can figure out
how to get out of the academic business entirely. Yet my own contradictory
feelings on this subject have perhaps helped me to undermine myself, since
when I do write criticism, I don't really use standard academic form, and
so my work has no academic value. Still, I've had enough response from
people to recognize that with few but significant exceptions, only poets
respond to my poetry, while critical academics will sometimes respond to
my ideas.

        I continue to believe that the poet-critic is a viable role, one
that many great people on this list, like A.L. Nielsen, play quite
valuably. But whatever we may think THEORETICALLY about the fact that
poetry can contain elements of criticism, and that criticism can contain
elements of poetry (that is, that the boundary can be undermined), there
is no doubt that academic systems (again with rare exceptions) treat this
split as though it's absolute.

        What form should a present moment poetics of criticism take? As
many as necessary, it seems to me. Some of this criticism will contain
promotion of the work it loves, some of it will not be academic close
reading. Henry's attempts to pass off some kinds of criticism (those which
deal with the work "directly," or which are closely critical of the
writers with whom one is closest) won't hold, I don't think. I myself was
glad that Steve Evans recent essay was not a close reading of poetry, and
in fact I can think of VERY few literary close readings that don't quickly
send themselves to the academic dustbin, my own included. In fact, if one
were to take the relation between poetry and poetics as seriously as I
believe we should, then that would mean that there might be as many forms
for poetics as there would for poetry, indeed it might mean that the two
terms in many cases would be no longer distinguishable.

        But for such a thing to happen, I think that we have to admit that
we live in a world where the "observer," encased in the abstractions of
"authoritative" and standardized critical forms, represents a way for the
bureaucratic maintenace of literature (read: English departments) to
continue without its own forms, both of writing and of administrating,
being called into any kind of significant question. And for the poet who
sees that and says, well, screw criticism entirely, I think we should have
a great deal of respect, even if its a position some of us would not in
fact share.

Mark, while some of the points you make & those I've been stressing over
the past week coincide (i.e. the dominance of "talk about" etc.), I
get the feeling you haven't understood what I've been saying. The criticism
I've been calling for is a different animal from "close reading" as you
described it.  You seem to think that there's either a positive review or
a negative review.  I'm suggesting that there's an intuitive, empathetic,
informed, and independent criticism possible - which smells the existence
of authentic poetry & points out its strengths & weaknesses, its attempts
& motives in relation to its achievements. Is
this fair to the poor little hard-workin' youngsters just trying to write a
lyric?  Yes it is - it might push them towards a saltier concept of their
OWN real motives, talents, & originality. & it might just notice what they've
been trying to do.

I'm sorry to hear you're joining Rod Smith in the whimper mode.  I don't think
the forebears we follow - name whatever good poet of the past you wish -
would catch themselves whining about their lack of time.  The poetry of the
past is in your nearest public library.  The poetry of the present is on your
computer.  The criticism - if you feel called to it - is in your bones.
So is the art & the poetry.  It flows there close to whatever life you can
call your own.  The Indie Crit I been asking for runs somewhere between
the bought-out academic mode you yourself debunked & the sub-critical
chicanery of an unquestioning, unquestionable poetics.

Subject:      Tom Clark's poems & his "Stalin as Linguist"
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

I thank Carlo Parcelli for his second post, just read. What I want to say
today has more reference to his prior post, of 1/30/98. It also refers to
Dale Smith's praise of Tom Clark a couple weeks ago, and also to Joe
Safdie's post of 1/23/98. Let me preface these comments by remarking that a
day on the List is like a week in everyday life. So that, in responding to
a post now 8 days old, I am carrying readers two months back, and I realize
the chance that you-all still have the Tom Clark poems which Joe posted, is
slim. But I am not about to copy them out again.

These 3 poems are #s 43,44,and 45 from a work called "Early Warning,"
unknown to me.  I can see the attraction they hold out : they constitute an
us-&-them world, where "they" are every bit as despicable as "they" are
always known to be, cowardly, secretive and vindictive in their unjustness,
and where each reader is invited to identify with the poet to form an "us"
that is better than his "they." One is thus offered some thing to belong
to, a superior thing where one's allies will be likewise superior.

Part of what is superior about the poet in these poems, is his attitude,
made explicit in the lines "I'm/ (for instance) as ingenuous and naively
trusting/ as your average Sudanese mercenary killer."  One appreciates the
twist of sense, which requires that one follow the syntax closely. Beyond
that, one finds oneself in the presence (as it were) of "nobody's fool." a
tough guy (albeit with a heart of gold--else we wouldn't be liking him) a
bit like Bogart or Bukowski.

Elsewise, there is the wit of analogy that delivers us to this bathetic
present after a quick whip around the corners of a Malebolge (or so I
feel); there are attractive passages where sound draws attention to meaning
(the way "clones" recalls "drone" and picks up on the "stones" and "bones"
from lines immediately previous) and by this process provides a further
guarantee that this poet has an ear--is listening to his lines as they
unfold, is _not_ asleep at the wheel.

There is also the thrill, at watching the lid ripped off this particular
can of worms. Ah, so just as we suspected, poets are as bad or worse than
the rest of this wicked world! And here's a real poet telling us this!


But my surrender to these poems doesn't last long. They lack, for one
thing, a sense of history. Poets have been banding together against one
another for millenia, so what's fresh about this content to excuse the
traditionalist form?

More of an objection, however, lodges in the wried logic. There is nothing
I can find in the poem to ironize that one instance of "I"--I take the poet
himself, Tom Clark, to be speaking, to be wanting to be heard speaking Tom
Clark's mind.But Tom Clark is known to be (however relatively) a succesful
writer, with dozens of books from distinguished houses. "To survive in the
'arts' you've got to be a belonger." Well, Tom Clark has survived, so to
what does he belong, to which
"school,...club,...cell,...lodge,...party...[or] police force" does Tom
Clark owe his survival?

His answer might lie in the "outsider" category. I cannot see how, in the
dog-eat-dog world Clark depicts, this category is in any way superior or
transcendent. How do these lines escape being as self-serving as anything
that might be produced from "school, club, cell, lodge, party, police
force" or cabal?

It is not that I altogether disagree with his picture. It is rather that
Tom Clark is no less a cannibal canine than the next man or woman. Despite
his apparent admission of this, "to relate to history not forgetting the
mistake of those who'd evade it," I do not find I can exit these 3 poems
without feeling that Clark believes that he can, and has evaded it. While
feeling, myself, that he has not. Because he cannot. Because (as he
implies) none of us can.

Here I refer my reader to Carlo Parcelli's post of 1/30/98, to his mention
of "position/momentum paradox" and "influence of the observer upon the
observed." And to what he deduces from these physico-philosophical
quandaries : "every participant in the current debate is subject to these
limitations [.]" I do not believe it is enough to acknowledge this truth
then to proceed as though nothing was altered because of it. It is a truth
that calls for constant attention. It explodes the us/them construction,
_no matter the empirical persistence of such divisiveness_ . Both Tom and I
(as any of you) being subject to these limits, I ask him, "Why do you
create a world of attitude where you have always to be branded as
'distrustful, dangerously suspicious' as an 'outsider'--while holding down
an inside post with Black Sparrow Press? " It is 35 years since Bukowski
was named 'Outsider of the Year' and neither he nor the press that
presented him has any pretense to outsider status today. As a category, in
any case, 'outsider' today must include so many as to be meaningless. It
remains "someone to be," if it's elsewise too scary walking down the
street, or boring or whatever : Fred Dobbs.

I do not find that the epiphany at the end of the 3rd of these poems is
credible: "only makes me laugh and study/ ways to gain a new power over
words/that are so stubborn, to steer them into/ clear and simple sentences
is a good lifetime's work." It does not dissolve the paranoid portrait of
hate and distrust and envy, or not persuasively to my reading. And while it
is plain that Tom Clark is consumed by these vices, the poetry would be a
big step closer to the greatness certain acolytes claim for it (not to
mention Clark himself) were he to _assume_ and _own_ them.

I do not think we inhabit times that permit such linear renunciation of
indulged miseries. You _are_ what you _describe_ . It's the Tarbaby none
can escape. (I use my own knowledge of my own powers of denial, my own
hypocrisies, my own envy and mortifcation at exclusion, to decode Tom
Clark). No part of any poem is _more_ than any other part.

So I find these poems have a short life. They belong to a way of being that
no longer works. I read them, as I read Bukowski, with some pleasure of
recognition, but end up in nausea, at the impossible perspective :
them=bad, us=good. (Even us=bad, them=good would be an improvement, but not
for long; the entire divisiveness of these presumptions is deadly.)

Perhaps a quick look at Clark's essay published in _Partisan Review_ in
1987 (reworked from an article in _Poetry Flash_ in 1985) and called
"Stalin as Linguist" may help clarify what I think Clark needs to do in
order to become the poet and intellectual he surely wants to be, given his
envy and resentment of intellectuals and most other poets (those not in his
club).

He begins by citing Brecht : "To write poetry now, even on current events,
means to withdraw into the ivory tower.  It's as though one were practicing
the art of filigree.There is something eccentric, cranky, obtuse about it.
Such poetry is like the castaway's note in the bottle." Clark notes that
Brecht issued this statement (a kind of renunciation, even in advance, of
the contents of the _Selected Brecht_ I keep by this desk) in 1942. But
Clark doesn't bring this up to qualify the renunciation; he doesn't point
out that in the horror of civilized barbarism peaking in that year, such a
sentiment might be heartfelt, but might be revisited and revised later. No,
he says that "it has never been more applicable than at present."

  And to whom then does Clark apply it? Not to all poets, although that was
surely Brecht's meaning. Not to himself, although as one writing poetry
since 1942, he is just as surely included in Brecht's denunciation as
anyone else. No, he singles out just one group, and applies what Brecht
meant as general anathema, only to the Language Poets. Thenceforth, Clark
proceeds with his attack on _In the American Tree_ . ("Well," as Mandy
Rice-Davies would have repeated, "He would, wouldn't he?" -- he had been
excluded).

   The kind of dodge by which Clark attmepts to enlist Brecht to attack
Watten in this essay is all too common throughout his evaluative writing.
It is dishonest, hypocritical, and bathetic. --Why does he need Brecht's
posthumous assistance? Isn't Clark the equal of this situation without
Brecht?

But of equal importance, this ploy discloses, again, Clark's fantasies of
superiority. Brecht damned all poetry, but Clark nimbly escapes the
Brechtean thunderbolt. Or he does, in the eyes of such readers as need to
turn a blind eye to their master's blindnesses, in order to go on belonging
to ...something, and believing in ... someone.  As though there weren't
already their own intelligence to doubt, and their own intuitions to
challenge, and the reading to be done from the list Parcelli supplies, if
we are to make a poetry the measure of the going situation of mind and
world. Believe in that!  David

I cant figure out what the reference "indie critic" or "indi critic" is
referring to. Does it mean a critic from India, or a critic of race cars?

Thanks to David B for his reading of Clark and reposting of such.  My main
problem with these sections of "Early Warning" - though I'm in basic
agreement w/ David's reading - is that its very structure seems pretty
hackneyed stuff: & I don't mean its not sufficiently "experimental": even
among current examples of more traditional uses of structure it just seems
kind of tired.  Look what happens when you empty it of its buzz-words:

"43
    Driven together by a blank to blank
    Knowing no blank but that of blank
    They continued to blank each other's blank
    Even in this blank of blank
    Though allegedly they were dedicated to blank
    Instead it was blank that motivated them
    So that they resembled blank
    Traveling in a blank with maximum blank
    The attention of blank turned instantly to any
    blank who threatened to blank
    The rest, and this blank was collectively attacked"


This is what I call "the cliche of syntax".  A pretty old story indeed.

My apologies to Mark & Rod for the querulous tone.  Writing conditions are
rarely simple & easy.  This is not high school football & I'm not a
coach.

Auntie Hen was not nagging you for not being critics (Mark is a critic).
As I said originally, poets themselves are conflicted with their own
interests.  This doesn't rule out dem writing crit but a lot of Indie
Crits will be glad just to write good reviews.  I know there are such
people out there.  My whole point was to characterize (1) the difference
between true Indie Crit and the kind of writing bent on promoting
the immediate status/recognition/advantage of a person or group; and (2) the
difference between Indie Crit and scholarly writing.  By differentiating
it I was trying to bring it forward as a force for clearing the air and
recognizing poetry when it happens. Indie Crits have a silver rope
which attaches them directly to Poetry.  You can get them at Adler's
Hardware here in Providence; I can't vouch for other places.  The one
I got though is quite SHORT & doesn't allow me to reach several of
the low-growth new species springing up.  Is this a problem for other
Indie Crits?

George, I checked with the Anglo-Indie "buddy" of mine, Eric Blarnes -
he seems to think an "Indie-Crit" is one of those lil critters you find
all over India & in some large US cities around the kitchen sink &
the breadbox - they are as fast as race cars - at least I think that's
what Blarnes was saying - he was calling from Madras & the line was
fuzzy - he kept saying - "pass th' gindie! pass th' gindie! em forster,
em forster! forster!"  Well, I don't know... - Jack Spandrift

in this realm let me recommend ira livingston's book, Arrow Of Chaos:
Romanticism and Postmodernism, in the U of MN press's Theory Out of Bounds
series.  it's hard to characterize and idiosyncratic, but tht is part of
what makes it anti-systemic and very charming and smart.

Bob Hale asks how goes the million poems project.

Henry calls for an independent auditor from within the group. But Henry,
that's like putting the director on the board! You would have to leave the
group, zap the p-ram, rewind, disappear, watch yr parents make love!

True, Barney Newman wrote nice things about birds and city planning. Would
it be really be surprising if all these poets we are started talking about
subjects other than the goddam importance of poetry? And if there were a
paraphrasable meaning there nobody'd mentioned yet (notice: not 'thought
of') would that be terrific. And if there suddenly proved to be poetry
written before 1855, what of it? Short and long words, short and long
vowels, no meaning but in variation.

We are natural consultants. Or we're fluoridated consultants, either way,
there is a common willingness to speak and to speak well about everyone
else's business. Good! Now get yr sloppy knees out of Providence and start
scraping at court like the rest of the masquers. Loshar haron, baby.

Bob, I am subcontracting not by seance but by association. It still looks
like forty poems a day for the next seventy years. Worst case is I become
pharaoh and conscribe the entire output of the umfahs. Best case is the
third bureaucratic dream and all that's asked is what Bruce said at your
party, a thousand lines. Ah but then to have to Scheherazade for my supper
and write each line a book of stone eight miles long! And call it the
Strand.

Henry, the truth is more important than novelty or mere quality, right? Why
assume nobody knows this? If it's rollerderby you want, I can lend you my
skate key. I'd rather make sense or nonsense of other arts and sports. The
best criticism is living hell.

OK enough stale syntax from me

        Hey, Henry, thanks for your response! But I think you will note
that the criticism which you call for actively does exist, if you have
been paying attention. I think you HAVE been reading the various
publications in which such criticism appears, but if you have not, let me
point you in its direction: magazines like Talisman, Witz, the forthcoming
Tripwire, Poetic Briefs as it appears on occasion, Chain, and others of
longer and shorter tenures.
I'm a little bit mystified as to why you think such criticism does not
exist, unless you
think that your broad generalizations that all contemporary critical
writing is mere puffery is itself a statement of more than mere
generalized anti-puffery. Do you really believe that what's going on with
poets today can simply be reduced to a kind of mutual careerist
ass-kissing, in which you yourself may be the only voice calling for a
legitimate self-criticism? As an Ernest Hemingway character once said,
"Isn't it nice to think so?"

        On the subject of "whining," while it's clear to me that the
erosion in the quality of American work life, in the academic world and
elsewhere, must primarily be laid at the door of the changing nature of
American business-life (with its increasing consolidation of wealth at the
top, and its elimination of stable jobs and a startlingly high rate of
speed), I do feel that the sustained political ignorance of tenured
English professors like yourself towards the rapidly decaying quality of
academic life bears some responsibility for the troubled (some might say
disastrous) conditions of life in English departments. Thankfully, some
tenured English professors have both the grace and the courage to see that
attacks on the tenure system, and the reliance on part-time professors
with minimal salaries, no benefits, and very little ability to protect
themselves from administrative whims represent a threat to their own,
perhaps limited autonomy. That legitimate critiques of this system seem to
you "whining" make it perfectly clear to me to what extent you remain part
of the problem, rather than the solution. So, while I actually do enjoy
your poetry, I'm afraid that cannot override the fact that in terms of
those of us presently involved in seeking change in the academic world,
your presence on this list, and in academic life, represents an ultimately
negative force. And this is a great shame, because your energy and
intelligence, both of which are clearly great, could be useful rather than
destructive.

Thank you Henry Gould:

"Criticism can be an art form too, if and when it's brave enough to look at
poetry as something other than a career or a kind of translated politics."

And, of course, poetry must be brave.

Mark Wallace's longish post was the first in this very prolific thread
that I felt much positive response to.  Great set of comments, Mark!!

I read most things I hear of, that examine Langpo and other
non-mainstream work,...and I strongly agree, that ideas rather than poetry
have received most of the attention from acadominating commentators...And
*the idea of the poetry*...Since the official verse kult'ure is very
threatened by stuff that sounds interesting, they are much happier talking
at and about the work, than listening to it, and engaging it.

In general I've little use for Henry's indie productions, that have
garnered so many expressions of support.

I think the best and most useful and productive criticism and theory, is
being done by poets.

When I think of an indie critic, I picture Helen Vendler.

Subject:      The Necessity of Moral Perception

I think that David's problem with Tom's poems is similar to problems some
people have had in response to some of Henry's naked posts.  The assumption is
that both Tom and Henry stand aside from the critique they make.  Others find
find these judgments invalid because the authors offer their complaints from
an isolated realm above that which they judge.  But I think these blunt
observations and direct engagements of moral and artistic values put both
writers in extremely vulnerable positions.  Anyone who offers a moral critique
of an orthodox community risks the same rebuttals and diminishments that these
exacting and demanding words provoke.  Know one likes to be reminded that
poetry, like everything else in this country, functions and has functioned on
the same market values as business.  PR is necessary or your poems risk an
obscurity matched only by your life.  Voices such as Tom's are reminders that
you've got to have something to sell, something to bring for your business
efforts.  Promotion is not necessarily the problem, it's what you're promoting
that raises eye-brows.  Tom's and Henry's courage to state the obvious that
few are willing to admit, however, is essential if poetry is to maintain
a resemblance to its ancient roots and the possibilities of power those
roots teach.  Tom's critique stems from survival, anglo and monosyllabic.  He
sacrifices your good opinions of him in order to remind you that there are
reasons besides our vanity and positions in the world of mammon to engage the
art of poems.  By the way, he may have quite a few books on the market, but
he's made little profit on them, especially in recent years.  At a time when
other poets of his generation are accepting the rewards of their labor, Tom
suffers under a   weight of indifference due to the weak-minded and patheticall
y fearful troops of the poetic apocolypse.  Anyway, his dedication, vulnerabili
ty, and willingness to speak clearly against the machines of our markets has
cost him more than a perceived lack of irony.

Selling is the game, but you've got to have something of value.  That's why
business is a more honest trade these days, if less glamorous and more tedious

Jordan thinks I'm calling for an internal auditor so we can have more
ISN'T POETRY GREAT writing.  Jordy, you may be suffering from list-
overdose, and it sure is nice when people think of things other than
poetry to write about (like Newman).  But you lookin in the wrong
side of the mirror.  Indie-critics aren't part of our club.

Mark thinks I'm just generalizing by pointing out the diff between
independence & individual/group puffery.  I guess we see things
differently.  I have said all along that yes there are indie crits
out there.  But I stand by my exaggeration that 99% of what you find
in the journals we jump on is either puffery or somebody's
academic churn-out.  Funny how it gets called "politics".

Mark, I don't think you or Rod or anybody's whining.  I apologize again
for that.  What I do say is that your tenure wars or job hassles, or
Rod's take on the munchin'prole status of his generation - WHILE
IT MAY BE OF GREAT INTEREST & EVEN AFFECT A POETIC STYLE - in no
way proves that a poetry is beyond criticism.  & I repeat: Indie crits
will be the best readers of what's out there.

>>I cant figure out what the reference "indie critic" or "indi critic" is
referring to. Does it mean a critic from India, or a critic of race cars?

Neither. It means "In dee Critic", meaning where to insert the poem.

This reader is reminded of the German "Das Geld hier einwerfen!",
stalwartly translated on coinboxes throughout Germany as "Throw your money

Bully for you, David! Did you know, funny coincidence, that Uruguay's
most famous contemporary writer is named Mario Benedetti?

Bene, bene, Benedetti - thou too hast read the parable aright, along
with Brother Dale.  For he that hath nought whereof to sell, behold,
thou shalt find him doin' the street-shell game on Broadway.
Behold, this is a hard saying for yon poets; hard indeed is
the sell whereof I speaketh.  For it would be better for them
not to sell at all; lo, this is the Walter Mitty safeliest way
of yon courageous Henry.

anyone have a snail-mail address for Michael Angelo Tata (poet featured in

On the contrary, I think Michael has just improved Tom's poem greatly!
An excellent method of "making it new," Michael! Just leave it up to the
reader's imagination -- make the reader the author -- isn't that one of
the very tenets of the poetry you admire?

Hmm...this seems "ultimately ungenerous,"  I thought mine was a somewhat
interesting excercise, I rather like my version, pot-shots at the "poetry
I admire" aside, now that I think about it; but, oh well, back to my
little laboratory of "experiments" (that's what the poets you admire think
of the poets I admire, isn't it?).  Last of my tit-for-tat, -m.

Subject:      Celan/Montale/Olson/Coatlicue

On a certain level - like one of the allegorial levels in Dante's
INFERNO, where each character is both irrefutable and damned - Henry
the Bull's call for a independent critic - the Voice of the General Reader -
is relentless & undefeatable.  The most cogent counter-argument simply
points out the limitations of that argument while augmenting its undeniable
results.

Here in Sydney a study group has evolved into four separate groups in
dialogue, each based on a different subject: Celan, Montale, Charles Olson,
and the as-yet unread (for the most part) Mexican poet Guada L. Coatlicue.
The impact of Coatlicue's feminist subsumption & rewriting of the three
male Euro-American authors within a historical-personal _allegoria tota_
is difficult to encapsulate; but in relation to Henry the Bull's Papal Bulls,
one comprehends perhaps more deeply than was intended the meaning of "bull
darkness". To summarize: poetry, along with music & visual art, has enacted
a trajectory of autonomy over several generations; the most intense
and productive creations require a SPECIAL READING alert to the allegorical
motives of the text.  Henry"s "washed clean" indie crit is to the "bought
out" poet-as-con-artist as Coatlicue's poet-as-hermetic secret is to Henry's
indie-crit.  I.e. the indie-crit as representative of an aesthetic surface
response will never penetrate the interior motive of the poet-as-such.

The best way to support this argument is to "read" the last 7 days of Henry
the Bull postings in allegorical fashion.  At the center we find the poem
"Hieroglyph" which enacts a finally unproblematic response to "Papa" the
housebuilder & (Judaic?) Sphinx-interpeter; an unproblematic reading in
isomorphic equilibrium with the unproblematic relationship of "independent
critic" and "honest poem".  Place this in the context of the total U.S.
culture in which the "Papa" in the White House faces a "sementically"
charged analysis of shattered presidential authority:  we have a
compensatory complex which begins to reveal the tragi-comic ENACTMENT
of American reality.  From the Sydney perspective, down here way south
of the Meridian & out of the loop & very close to Poe's TEKE-LI-LI,
what surfaces is America's dramatic AGON-EKSTASIS - the fateful LACK
of an independent high culture expressed as the acting-out of theatrical
DISASTER at all levels crossing the Black VERNal JORDAN toward....  ???
Minstrel showbiz????

- Ben Carrelis, a.k.a. "Edgar Allan Poe"

p.s. one should point out, however, that, whatever the limitations of Henry
the Bull's analysis, our counter-analysis only reinforces his "prophetic"
enunciation.  Why?  Because if the presence of independent criticism is
a tragic phantasm of the Bullish imagination, then the "blurb" as expression
of appeal to the "general reader" (i.e. "this poet is going to change your
world") is DOUBLY fantastic - and, in Henry's words, a true example of
CHICANERY.

Lovely moment on public radio, caught with half an ear: William "Daddy
bought me a magazine" Buckley is being interviewed and the mostly very
deferential interviewer screws his courage to the sticking place and
asks: "Do you see any contradiction between your Christian faith and
your faith in capitalism?"  Buckley continues to wax grandiloquently
about this and that, ducks the question.  Time runs out and the
interviewer tries one last time: "So--do you see any conflict between
your faith in Christianity and your faith in capitalism?"  There's an
awkward silence and then Buckley says "Noooo.  If I saw any
contradiction, I'd have to give up my faith in Chris--I'd have to give
up my faith in capitalism."

Since Dale Smith began his recent tirades by calling David Bromige a "self
deluded, lying coward" & a "guardian of banality", among other things, I
think a willingness on Bromige's part to continue ANY form of dialog with
Smith is more than generous.

If Smith were interested in engaging in a discussion about the issues it
might come of something, but given that his argument reduces to "if you
knew him, you'd know that what he writes is what poetry is & always has
been, nothing else is poetry & anyone who can't see this as the ultimate
truth is an stupid asshole", I'm not sure that I can foresee any generous
end to the current discourse.

A charmingly romantic gesture on Smith's part, I suppose, but not the way
to try to talk among folks who are, whether he likes it or not, peers.

&, Joe, David's reading of the Clark passages you quoted deal EXACTLY with
the reasons you posted those stanzas, by pointing out that

>the
>lack of necessity to "interpret"

which you find to be

>a pleasure in and of itself

is only unnecessary if you buy into the presuppositions of the writer's

presumably not the entire text of Making of Americans but at around 1100

Yow! I'm sorry, Maria! I really never meant to put you on the defensive, nor
did I mean to imply you weren't dancing as fast as you can. I know you are! My
question was probably very naive; I was under the assumption that your original
question ("anyone else noticed imbalance?") implied longing for some
more-than-individual push toward rectification. Further assumption being that
any such nudge might, at this time, be communal, as opposed to individual,
effort. I thought you were calling to arms! & was kinda prompting you further,
wondering if you had some ideas you were tempted to throw out. Anyway, putting
you on the defensive was really the last thing on my mind. Forgive me!

Yeah.  And what are these changes?  Do you mean the ones that continue
to turn the academy into a dalliant intstitution of artistic and intellctual
pretensions?  The continued attempts of jealous critics to remove power from
the poets in order to fulfill their own uncreative hunger for the poet's
intuitive abilities?  The continued removal of literature from practical
interprative skills?  The alienating and continued building of obscure
hermetical theories of vain and deluded investitures?

I may be wrong, but part of the academy's failure is that it has allowed
critics to distort the balance of art and interpretation *and quite a few
of the poets bought into that*.  The problems facing those of us who want to
know something, regardless of which side of the academic fence you're on, is
practical.  As poetry and criticism blur into a more and more similar form, the
power of both weakens.  But perhaps I'm missing something of this new academy.
I hope so.  Maybe I'm wrong.  Steve Evans is certainly a dedicated critic.
Maybe there are others with devotion to poetry, rathe than to ideas about it.

Dear Rachel,

Interesting issues--I suppose that I would have to hone in on the question
you ask about the connection between Nick Regiacorte's work and
Josh May's work.

This kind of questions brings up something really fascinating--I
think--something that answers to a lot of the recent posts on the list
about criticism in general--

I think (as a sometimes-critic, and also as a poet) that good criticism is
usually a homage to one's own taste--

If I like a writer's work, I want people with whom I share "discourse" to
be familiar with that person's work--

I want that person to be able to publish a book if that's what he or she
wants to do--

I want to convince people that this writer is as good as I think he or she
is so that, finally, I can further enjoy this person's work and share it
with others--

If I like a writer, I want to "share" that writer with others--

Now of course my take on the writer is going to be highly
situated--highly personal--

If I set up camps or groups of writers--it is merely according to
my whims, my take on their work--

Perhaps (as is true of my magazine) I would try to put writers in various
contexts together so that certain aspects of their work might be
highlighted and (inevitably) other aspects of their work be
de-emphasized--

I don't think there's anything wrong with this approach--

Personally, I was trained in anthropology as an undergrad--

I also majored in English--

In the early 90s, the two disciplines shared a lot of concerns (vis-a-vis
Foucault, Greenblatt, Derrida etc).

I always found that the debates that were current in anthro at the time
applied readily to issues in lit crit.

How can an observer even pretend to be objective about another culture
(poetic?)?

How can one still write ethnography (criticism) in the context of the
"new" "world system" (or, alternatively, the newly homogenizing, and
increasingly market-driven "academic economy")?

How can anthropologists continue to practice ethnography in light of their
traditional (whether purposeful or no) collusion with colonial forms of
oppression--

e.&&&&

All of these questions resulted in some pretty simple answers:

The anthropologist should try to make it clear to the reader--to the best
of their ability--their situation, where they're coming from. Pretentions
toward objectivity were abandoned in some regards in 80s and early
90s anthro--

The anthropologist should, perhaps, focus on cultures that have been
considered heretofore not so "strange" or "exotic"--science, governement,
stock-market culture, gamblers in Vegas etc. (Mimesis and Alterity by
Michael Taussig is interesting in this regard--)

                                                (This issue echoes, I
think, this notion that critics are inevitably the "oppressors"--that
somehow it seems that only poets should be "allowed" to write
criticism--or perhaps that poets should never be allowed to write it--the
binary is similar in either case)

The anthropologist should keep a number of ethical imperatives in mind
at all times:

Do not "study a culture" to its detriment--

Do not collude with the "forces of oppression"--

Do not make claims about a given culture (poetic?) without having done
the necessary research--

Etc.

I think that most of the above leads to one conclusion in particular--

The best way to encourage fair and ethically sound criticism (of a
culture--of a book of poetry?) is to encourage all different types of
people to practice such criticism--

Rather than push objectivity, perhaps we should try a new approach--and
push subjectivity.

That's how I do my criticism--that's how I edit. Sometimes my
"subjectivity" demands that I publish work that isn't "perfect" because it
still contributes to a larger dialogue in which I may be "subjectively"
interested--

I try to have braod representation (race, gender, poetic camp, ability
to craft a poem etc) in my magazine because it is in my best
interest--intellectually and socially--to encourage an array of voices,
approaches, poetics--even "abilities."

I like to put Nick R and Josh M together because of my highly subjective
interest in some of the tonal strategies they both employ--

This is because I am very interested in tone in my own writing--

I also mention them because I go to school with them and am forced to
engage with their work on a daily basis--

These are not, in my view, things to be ashamed of--they are partialities,
yes, but they are my partialities--partialities that I would never expect
anyone else to take on--though I would love it if they did--

Yours,
Katy (Mrs. Robinson Upstairs)

The discussion of short words and so on recalled Beckett's poem _Thither_,
the title being a wry mini-doc on nationalism.  In Ireland th will most
likely be pronounced d or t.  So, many of my compatriots would pronounce it
_Tidder_  (Titter is possible but not used.  In Gaelic it would be
pronounced h giving us combinations like _Hitter_ and so on.)  Also, few
enough Catholic Paddies would know the word, which appears in _The Book of
Common Prayer_  and the Authorised Version, thus fencing off the main
religious menus.  Denoting motion towards, this out-of-date couple of
syllables, shibboleth and thumbnail history glosses many of the circles
around which we, in this bi-partite island, have gone and are likely to
continue going for some time.

Katy, I think the position you've laid out here is probably standard for
the field at the moment.  And if you read Ben Carrelis' interesting post
from Australia, you'd understand that your position is the "safest",
considering, as Ben pointed out, the dense, hermetic and highly autonomous
nature of contemporary work & the need for a deep grounding in it before
"standards" of criticism can be applied.  Nevertheless, if this is the
best that editors & critics can do, I find it rather sad.  My call is for
a truly independent criticism - in which critics maintain a concept of
poetry-in-general - ADMITTEDLY SUBJECTIVE & developmental, perhaps, but
still, a PERSONAL STANDARD - which allows them to write in truly critical
fashion: i.e. as an interpreter, perhaps even a praiser, of work, but
NOT as an advocate.  Such independent criticism would require a style
and approach which equals in originality & rectitude the individual
standard "Henry" said is a requirement for making poetry itself ("the word
on the line").

I am not trying to debunk your kind of criticism; in a multifarious world
of deep writing such exploration is natural and necessary.  All I am
asking is that you & others not DENY the very possibility of a criticism
which MEASURES (by its own standards) rather than PROMOTES a particular
writing.

The term "indie" is a net term, or so I think -- it claims to mean
"independent" but really just means "individual" and refers to sites on the
net where someone offers opinion or analysis on his own hook, i.e. not as
part of an institution.

Examples from the industry I know best include the sites of Dave Winer
www.scripting.com/davenet/ or Doc Searls' Reality 2.0 at
www.searls.com/r2.html or Chris Locke(aka Rage Boy)'s site at
http://www.rageboy.com. (These are all friends of mine, so if you don't
like their work tell somebody else)

There are equivalent sites by the hundreds of thousands I'd guess on every
topic.

Subject:      Tom Clark's Brecht quote
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

I didn't read Tom Clark's Partisan Review essay; I didn't even hear
much about it at the time. Hence I wasn't aware that he'd used
Brecht's 1942 quote as a way to characterize language poetry.

David Bromige's excellent post on Clark, which btw exemplifies the
ways a poet can be a wonderful critic, does not all the same
go far enough in showing us the nature of this ugly smear (and,
by implication, this ugly man).

All I know of the essay (& I expect never to know more) is its title
(reference to Stalin) and the Brecht quote (reference to Hitler).
That's enough for me.

The title quotes a poem by Watten (I don't remember which, however),
which itself refers to the fact that Stalin authored (i.e. somebody
wrote for him) a pamphlet on Linguistics. It's among my books somewhere,
but I can't locate it easily enough to find and supply its title. I'm
sorry not to be able to be more specifically helpful re: Barry's poem
or Stalin's pamphlet.

Obviously, the reference to this work or self-positioning of Stalin is
the entry point to whatever world of reference, thought, analysis, feeling
is opened up in Watten's line (for an analysis of which however I'd
need the context at hand). Obviously, also, it is *not* a simple naming of
Stalin as a linguist. Neither simple identification, nor any kind of
naming of an authority. Nor is it a characterization of language.

It would appear, however, that this is how Tom Clark wants to use it. He
wants to use it against his fellow poets. The moreso given his really quite
disgusting appropriation of Brecht's words to the identical purpose of
harming his fellow poets.

My work is associated with the group of poets Tom Clark sought to flavor with
the odor of fascism, of Stalinism. It's more than a decade ago, but I can
smell the brush he waved past my face.

I'm also a Jew. Most of my family on my father's side and many on my
mother's side were killed by Nazis.

I don't mind if Tom Clark sells himself; I don't even mind if he
sells himself to the devil. And I don't think my personal history
condemns his foul words. But, I do tend to take this kind of thing
a little personally. I don't want that brush in my face.

For a long time, I studied with Hannah Arendt, author of Eichmann in
Jerusalem. I struggled with the conclusion to that book, in which
Arendt at once acknowledges the immorality of punishment by death and
at the same time approves the execution of Eichmann. I went to see
her in her office with my struggle. I well remember her words that
there are people who exclude themselves from the social contract
by their actions, who put themselves outside of moral consideration.
It was in this way that she could accept and even underline the
execution of Eichmann.

What exists on that scale also exists on a smaller scale. I'm not
suggesting that Tom Clark put himself outside the moral order --
not at all. But that intellectual act was outside the moral order,
hintingly associating poets around him with fascism and Stalinism
and by contrast obviously positioning himself in the role of resist-
ance, the moral role -- selling himself in that role -- I find that
disgusting.

For every person who pushes himself forward at another's expense in this
manner, there are acolytes waiting to line up behind the effort. I'm
sorry to see Joe Safdie and Dale Smith line up behind Tom Clark's
effort to position his poetic career on the backs of his peers.

Perhaps Joe at least will say that his relation to this is more complex;
that he is not a supporter of the position. I don't think Dale has that
option, except by way of changing his mind (which would be welcome).
I also don't think, however, that there is a more complex or nuanced
response available. Casuistry is not a noble art of mind. Tom Clark's
undeniable verbal skill and nimble imagination don't militate against
purpose; they only make it more necessary to resist that purpose.

Hello Poetics.

Rachel Levitsky here to report on last Thursday's Left Hand Reading.
Listling Patrick Pritchett,
Naropa student, Megan Marsnik,
and CU Creative Writing chair, Marilyn Krysl

took the audience,

which was mostly sitting on the floor
since to our surprise the previous owner took the chairs with
him when he moved and sold the building to health food giant
Wild Oats (no one is sure of future fate of reading space, but
all signs suggest there is reason to be worried)

like I said, we took a ride around the world, from Pritchett's journey
into chemistry of the fire burns Joan of Arc--it's parallel agency with
language:

"Fire as verb as noun

as endless altar and supercollider"

to Megan Marsnik's (four) stories covering (inhabiting) the terrain of
domesticity, ending with a scathing, hilarious spoof on the halo of
reception that pregnancy receives, the assumed bliss of a woman in that
compromised state.

to Marilyn Krysl's exquisite economy of words, crossing with the economy
of India, her travels in South Asia, including a few month's work at a
Mother Theresa hospice, turned into careful, eerily passionate
collection of poems _Warscape With Lovers_ which earned Krysl the
Cleveland State Poetry Center prize.

The Series has four open slots, and the second to last was filled by
Marc DuCharme, who blasted out an incredible collaboration, the
collaborators name I can't remember, that wouldn't quit, as wouldn't
Marc's brilliant presentation.  What I remember is the poems repeatedly
expressed desire to end itself, but couldn't, without covering all of
it.

Actually, my 'argument' said that there is a vulnerability in these poems
that David did not acknowledge.  If I confused this with Tom's personal life
it's because I find poetry to be personal as well as a public statement, reflec
tion or expression etc...  And the 'us-them' bianary I'm accused of does not
originate with me.  Scroll through the archives of this list and you will find
plenty of examples in which Tom or Ed have been branded with various stigmatas
that place them well outside of the poetics community shared by many here.  I d
on't know what else it takes to 'engage' on this list, by the way.  As a 'peer'
I think I've responded with generous efforts to explain my positions.  Maybe
referring to David, in a moment of anger, as a self-delusional coward, etc. was
out of line.  But as a guardian of... something...I still have no doubts.  Just
as I, for whatever reasons of dementia and devotion, respond in kind to comment
s I find floundering in the usual realms of accepted platitudes.  If that's
'charming' or 'romantic' great.  And by the way, those poems Joe posted, though
apropos to the discussion, aren't very representative of Tom's work.  But
I doubt if this list would generate much discussion about his poems on Keats,
say.  Or other unfashionable subjects like that.  The syntax might be too
'uninteresting.'  As if sintax was the only measure of verse.  The sensual
pleasures of language - the music, the rhythm - can be as entertaining as the
mental stimulation of syntax.

Since Dale Smith began his recent tirades by calling David Bromige a "self
deluded, lying coward" & a "guardian of banality", among other things, I
think a willingness on Bromige's part to continue ANY form of dialog with
Smith is more than generous.

If Smith were interested in engaging in a discussion about the issues it
might come of something, but given that his argument reduces to "if you
knew him, you'd know that what he writes is what poetry is & always has
been, nothing else is poetry & anyone who can't see this as the ultimate
truth is an stupid asshole", I'm not sure that I can foresee any generous
end to the current discourse.

A charmingly romantic gesture on Smith's part, I suppose, but not the way
to try to talk among folks who are, whether he likes it or not, peers.

&, Joe, David's reading of the Clark passages you quoted deal EXACTLY with
the reasons you posted those stanzas, by pointing out that

>the
>lack of necessity to "interpret"

which you find to be

>a pleasure in and of itself

is only unnecessary if you buy into the presuppositions of the writer's
"plain statements."

See you on the block,

Hi Henry,

I admire your commitment tp this issue! In the last post you wrote:All I
I am asking is that you & others not DENY the very possibility of a
criticism which MEASURES (by its own standards) rather than PROMOTES a
particular writing._

And if a poetry does _measure up_ (to my own critical standards), do I
then _promote_ it? Would expressing too much delight in the work count
as promotion (if I were a critic with a large audience)?

I must admit that I love reading her on Wallace Stevens--in large part

I find the opposite.  When poetry expands to "include" criticism--or
critical tactics--it gets more interesting for me, and loses nothing,
only gains.

Postmodern criticism is sometimes poetic.
Postmodern poetry is sometimes quite "critical."

        My apologies to Henry Gould for misstating his academic position,
and for my harshness of tone, although undoubtedly there were aspects of
what he said that were upsetting to me. Actually--how do these rumors get
started?--somehow or other I was completely convinced that he was a
university professor. In any case, I receive the poetics digest and didn't
see that Henry had probably posted a more generous response to the debate
BEFORE my last response. I wouldn't have continued in the tone that I did
if I had known.

        I think I would still suggest, Henry, that there may be more
independence in the poet-critic voices than you quite give credit for. We
don't simply promote each other, without critique, although it seems to me
that there are certain environments in which this kind of promotion is
called for--and sometimes this list is such an environment. Rather sharp
debate continues among poets and poet-critics of all stripes, and some of
the writers whose recent work I admire highly I have also been critical of
when the situation seems to call for it. I have a huge amount of
admiration for Ron Silliman, but when I think he's wrong about something,
which is actually rarely, I'm quite ready to say so. The criticism of
Steve Evans is of profound current importance, yet I have published and
posted commentary which also includes those places where I've found his
arguments less than sufficient, to me at least. And I think many other
poets and critics are involved in this sort of activity also.

        Ultimately, I don't think the difference is between critics with
cultural and poetic investments and those free of such investments, but
between the various kinds of investments that all critical writing
has--its loyalty or not to certain writers, its involvement with the
industry that makes its own existence possible, perhaps its financial
concerns. I agree with Dale Smith that writers need to "come clean" with
the underpinnings of their various allegiances, but I don't think that
there is some independent space outside of those allegiances. Does that
mean such criticism is biased, as well as fractious, etc? Certainly. But I
frankly see such overt partiality, if handled with an attempt to make such
partiality clear rather than a hidden subtext, as essentially a positive
force. Indeed the only way it could not be such would be if we still
entertained the fiction that a purely "objective," unattached criticism
could possibly exist.

see, i've just enacted one of the ways in which i don't get more done; i
bristle, misunderstand something, and communication gets weird.  no harm
done gary yr a pal and i appreciate your style. when i asked the question
--anyone else noticed imbalance --it was, of course, coming from someplace,
but the question was not simply rhetorical; i.e. the aanswers, particuarly
laura moriarty's, have indicated that there is probably more to the picture
than i'm figuring into the picture.  as for communal strategies, hmmm; i
don't know what i cd do, at the U.  not that many folks are interested in
the kind of writing i'm interested in (poetry); my grad seminars usually
draw abt 4 students and are in constant danger of cancellation (meaning
that i'd "owe" the U a course somewhere down the line).  The amount of $ it
costs to even bring one writer (expenses plus honorarium) is prohibitive.
the amount of arranging and organizing it takes to bring even one writer
is, for my limited energies, prohibitive.  after the series you
participated in, i was told that in the future i shd focus on more
"nationally known" figures (i should've retorted "known to whom?" or, "some
of these folks, like erik belgum, are *inter*nationally known") --but what
"nationally known" figure wd come for the miniscule $50 honoraria you all
got? (which brian and i secured by listing y'all as "human subjects" on the
grant proposal).  anyway, there i go whining again. sorry!  again, no harm
done. xo, md

Hi Henry,

I admire your commitment tp this issue! In the last post you wrote:All I
I am asking is that you & others not DENY the very possibility of a
criticism which MEASURES (by its own standards) rather than PROMOTES a
particular writing._

And if a poetry does _measure up_ (to my own critical standards), do I
then _promote_ it? Would expressing too much delight in the work count
as promotion (if I were a critic with a large audience)?

For all the occasional swipes it's fashionable to take at Helen Vendler,
I must admit that I love reading her on Wallace Stevens--in large part
because she's so clear about how much she loves his work.

Isn't that how we often explain art to each other--by pointing out the
qualities that delight us?


--- I have no quarrel with this.  I think a serious critic will explain
HOW a particular work measures up to WHAT standards; that these standards
will be fairly perceptive, consistent, and informed by wide reading;
and that the critic will display a certain CRITICAL INTELLIGENCE which
manifests itself in ORIGINALITY - i.e. not the writing of a protege,
a worshipper, a party-line adherent, or a hack.  Tell me something about
poetry in your review; don't just blindly glorify your subject.
The whole thrust of this thread has been to alert people to the
amount of "overdetermined" pure peddling that goes on, and that
if you're an honest critic, you are separating yourself from ALL that;
you have a choice when you sit down to write.  - Henry Gould

Katy Lederer makes some fine points here, which I see operating in
support of Don Byrd's very sensible suggestion that one should review
one's friends. Why not? DH Lawrence wrote (contra Eliot) that all good
criticism is subjective. Of course, TSE was subjective too - he just
liked to pretend he wasn't. Sound familiar HG? That all good criticism
involves a sympathetic reading of a work seems to me axiomatic, if I may
make that pronouncement. Where is the so-called "independence" in that?
It's less a matter of personal Olympianism than it is of "like to like."
Nietszche rightly mocked the cult of the individual - "you claim you are
free? Then show my your master stroke!" (Crude paraphrase from
_Zarathustra_).

To rephrase my earlier comment, Henry Gould wants to rescue the poem's
original use-value from its current market-value. Grandiosity
notwithstanding, this is a laudable goal. But as Mark Wallace pointed
out in his excellent post, there's plenty of critical work  already out
there which accomplishes just that and to cite some specific examples,
I'll mention again Hank Lazer's _Opposing Poetries_ which is as
judicious a book of criticism as one could ask for. There are others.
John Taggart's _Songs of Degree_ comes to mind. Criticism which is not
intensely partisan is very probably not worth a damn (though this too
can be carried to an extreme) and unless I'm way off, you seem to agree,
Comrade Hank.

I think (as a sometimes-critic, and also as a poet) that good criticism
is
usually a homage to one's own taste--

How can an observer even pretend to be objective about another culture
(poetic?)?

Rather than push objectivity, perhaps we should try a new approach--and
push subjectivity.

I appreciate your kind reaction to my somewhat baited remarks in previous
posts.  But the above paragraph shows where we are in basic disagreement.
The argument I have tried to make over the past few days is that just
as the poet needs to have a ferocious sense of personal responsibility
for his or her "word on the line", the substantial thing a critic has
to offer in this arena is a free devotion to poetry in its entirety
and a ferocious disposition to make an independent reading of every
new work.  I don't disagree with you that the storm and stress between
poets and groups in their jockeying for attention, recognition, and
authority may be a healthy thing.  It's probably both healthy and
unhealthy in various ways.  I simply would not call them (to paraphrase
Montale) free critics.  The poetry world perhaps above all others is
swallowed up in feverish "promotion" simply because there are no
agreed-upon standards and no one outside the poetry world is listening.
There never will be agreed-upon standards; but there will be critics who
will hold themselves aloof from the buddy-system, careerism, politics,
and puffery for the sake of criticism itself.  Believe in the silver
circus thread up to the tightrope.

1. Poets should do criticism.

2. They should do (in large part)  criticism that allows 'em to spell out
their interests and poetics.

3. This means a large amount of what they publish should be *positive* and
should *promote*...This'll mean they are often promoting poets they have
much in common with, and thus fairly often their freinds.  They should
nevertheless be able to make a free-standing intellectual argument of
reasonable coherence (and energy and interestingness) as to why such
poetry is good (or energetic, or interesting)..

4. They should think long and hard before being sharply critical of other
poets, because most of us have few enuff resources as things stand..

5. They should even try to promote and find value in work that is quite
different from their own.

6. If they feel it is truely in the interests of the art to be negative
about someone, they should slash away (..if they feel comfortable taking
the same medicine back!)

7. Poets should do criticism.  In general, I find, they are the ones who
have something interesting to say.

maria, rachel, kevin, dodie, pat, juliana, gary --

i had poetics switched off but my friend chris alexander forwarded me
your posts b/c he thought they would be of interest to me --

rachel's & maria's responses to gary's q's abt.
community interest & confuse me -- i had thought
the 70s-80s were a time of community & visibility building
for women poets (as juliana points out -- how(ever), & Tuumba & O
(tho the latter 2 not specifically geared twd. publishing women) --
which is part of the topic of an essay i'm currently writing, or a
dissertation i'm working on??));
weren't there also a lot of writing groups, etc?

since i *realized* innovative women poets (living 7 years in
cambridge mass didn't help) I've wanted to find out more &
there are a great deal of (both poetry & poetics) anthologies now --
but i always feel like i'm doing double-time (trying to read both
genders) this is perhaps silly but i wish it weren't so.  I want
to have all that stuff in place -- a history of writing, not just men
writing (re juliana's point abt langpo-originary tales)  -- "annals"
to turn to & i don't want to "discriminate" by only writing about
or reading women -- but there isn't a lot out there,
there are gaps -- probably b/c, as maria
points out, the longer the trip the lower a woman's survival rate.
so i feel like a first-wave feminist (researching --  not whole
canons (thank god!) --  but unearthing bits of history) when i want to be more
"post-feminist" or postmodern (in the sense of there is only
difference, we are all other).

Which brings me to the question of
feminism & writing as praxis. It seems to me that if a woman in any
way writes innovative poetry then she is a feminist, that her
feminism somehow preceeds but doesn't determine her need to write
(as it did say, in the 70s, e.g. Fraser's "poem in
which my legs are accepted" (and the whole her early books)
That is, feminism functions in the same way that *any* writer's
politics are a precedent (e.g.less *overtly* feminist works,
like Hejinian's _The Cell_ & Dahlen's _A Reading_) --

i guess i'm just tired of feminism being a woman-thing -- again,
wanting to be a postmodern feminist -- but not having the tools (the
tradition, the annals) to do that.

        Later this year will be appearing an anthology by forty
visual poets from around the world--two works apiece--made in response to
a poem of Celan's, "Blackbird"--the anthology contributors are visual
poets
who have been contributing to Harry Burrus' O!!ZONE in the last two years
and is edited by David Stone--in Baltimore.

    The state of the academy is such that there are no more than half a dozen
graduate programs where one can learn enough about contemporary poetry to even
begin the work of criticism.  One can learn to be excellent critics of Stevens
in many English Departments and one might learn how to read Yeats, perhaps
even Williams. I suppose you can still learn Eliot (who was about the only one
you could learn when I was an undergraduate). It will be hard to learn how to
read Pound, even harder to learn how to read Hart Crane, almost impossible to
learn Gertrude Stein, even H.D. or Marianne Moore.  Notably none of these
poets were born in the 20th century.

    Of poets, born in this century, you will be able to learn how to read them
only to the extent they resemble the known modernist masters.  Thus, you will
be able to learn to read Ashbery to the extent that he resembles Stevens (not
very much); you will be able to learn  read Olson to extent he resembles WCW
(hardly at all); you will not be able learn any thing about reading Coolidge
or Mayer because you can't learn how to read Stein.

    Pound said that the "beaneries" lag behind poetry by fifty years.  This
situation, if any thing, has gotten worse since he wrote.

    I can think of very little I have read about poetry by critics who were
not at least occasional poets which has been of much use to me either as a
poet or a reader of poetry.  Biographies are some times useful occupations of
academic's time, and often the best academic criticism is a kind of disguised
biography (e.g. Kenner's The Pound Era).  This is not a new situation. Most
often, you will find that if an academic critic has something interesting to
to say, s/he is cribbing off the criticial writings of poets.

    If you want to know about poetry, read poets, beginning with Coleridge or
Sidney or Dante.  You will find more in the letters of Keats or even the
essays of Mathew Arnold, for pete's sake, about poetry than you will in the
writings of contemporary Ph.D. critics from the best graduate schools, who are
likely (still! what? forty or fifty years after Roy Harvey Pearce) still to be
reading all American poetry only to the extent that it resembles Emerson.

    This, of course, is quite reasonable.  For the most part, Ph.D.s in
English, to the extent they are taught poetry at all, are taught it with the
view toward teaching it to undergraduates who, for the most part could hardly
be less engaged. This is grim task, to face 40 young people, who consciousness
can be completely absorbed by MTV, and to try to get them to notice the
linguistic curiosities of "The Snowman" or "To Elsie."  I know, I have done it
far too often myself.

   Please do not misunderstand.  I am completely with the undergraduates.  I
agreee that they should not be required to show up and listen to Professor X
groan on about the symbolist tradition or writing in the American language or
how this dead white male or female is important for resembling some deader
white male or female.

    And save us from any one who would pretend to be independent.
Independent, of what?  "Oh, I am independent, I have no commitments whatever."

    After all, criticism is its own test: it is useful, if it is useful.  We
will know whether it is honest or not if it helps us read the poet under
discussion, other poets, if it helps us write poems. Good criticism, by and
large, is probably rarer than good poetry.  I find myself going back to the
same things again and again: essays by Stein, Pound (especially the essays and
reviews on music), Williams, H.D., Hart Crane's letters, essays by Olson and
Duncan, a remarkable piece entitled "Burden of Set" by Gerrit Lansing, a
number of pieces by some of contemporaries.

Linda Russo raises an interesting point about "feminism being a
woman-thing." I would like to think "we" are moving beyond that into a
broader definition of feminism, though this may be disturbing to more
traditional feminists since it seems to imply a waning of political
attention to women's issues - I would hope it would be just the
opposite, though. Certainly vis-a-vis Cixous' idea of ecriture much
experimental writing would fit broadly under the feminist rubric, but if
it does, then again, the definition of that term is changing.

I attended a talk given by Susan Faludi last fall here in Boulder (ratio
of women to men in attendance roughly 3:1). Many women were upset when
she announced that her new book would be looking at (heterosexual) men's
issues re: relationships, empowerment, etc. They took this as a betrayal
but it seemed to me not only like a generous gesture, but like the next
logical step. As you say, Linda, it's difficult terrain to negotiate
since there's little or no precedence to rely on. Judith Butler and
Gayle Rubin seem to be offering alternative/postmodern models for gender
that challenge and expand the narrow parochial views of the Catherine
MacKinnon camp but my sense is that no one's too clear about the Big
Picture or where theory and praxis are leading next.

Which brings me to the question of
feminism & writing as praxis. It seems to me that if a woman in any
way writes innovative poetry then she is a feminist, that her
feminism somehow preceeds but doesn't determine her need to write
(as it did say, in the 70s, e.g. Fraser's "poem in
which my legs are accepted" (and the whole her early books)
That is, feminism functions in the same way that *any* writer's
politics are a precedent (e.g.less *overtly* feminist works,
like Hejinian's _The Cell_ & Dahlen's _A Reading_) --

i guess i'm just tired of feminism being a woman-thing -- again,
wanting to be a postmodern feminist -- but not having the tools (the
tradition, the annals) to do that.

It's the last poem (in 66 sections) of a book Tom published in 1984
entitled _Paradise Resisted: New and Selected Poems_ from (yes) Black
Sparrow. (I reviewed it in _Poetry Flash_ by the way). As I said in my
post, it's not his best, nor one of my favorites, nor even, as Dale
says, particularly representative -- it is quite funny in parts, as is
the whole book. But just after the three stanzas I quoted comes one
quite different in tone:

46
Copper, iron, lead, graphite, phosphate, zinc . . .
Palm oil is used for margarine, soap,
lubrication. The ground nut and cola nut
produce oils. Cotton becomes flax.
Export of coffee, grains, fabrics, oil, gold,
rubber, fruits, this is the story of
colonialism in Africa. The story of
human labor turned into money for distant
people to create pyramids of power
in banks is the story of Europe. This
is where we got the language we use.

And then, finally, section 47, which I'll quote only in part as it deals
with the appropriation question you raise:

 . . . The industrial world
gave us the computer world we employ
today. Uranium, radium, tin, iron,
spices. Diamonds. Food for thought.
It all came from somewhere. You can't
give anything back but you can stop
taking it. Start making and using it.
Only if you get the sentences clear.

I don't admire the music or rhythm here, particularly (but the fact that
you can't separate them, or the syntax, from content, David Benedetti,
was EXACTLY my point!); I do admire what I call a certain "high
seriousness" -- an ambition that arises from clear-eyed social
perceptions and entrepreneurial realties, informs the poems, and leads
(ideally) to other spheres of action than ones purely aesthetic; I
admire the implication that these economic and entrepreneurial realities
affect the way we, as poets, set up shop; and yes, I admire the lack of
ambiguity! In terms of the "big political ideas" bandied about a few
days ago, I feel globalization is even more pernicious and dangerous
than ecological disasters . .

I leave the rest of your post for tomorrow, as this is already long and
as I haven't actually read the essay in question -- I just remember the
article in _Poetry Flash_ that was apparently its genesis. (But Herb! I
don't agree that David is here responding to my "interpretation" riff at

I agree that good criticism is rare; I admit that the best is done by poets.
I've been marking poets' conflict of interest as yet another way of pointing
to the fact that criticism is a worthy art in itself.  You only have to
pretend to be independent if you don't believe you can be in reality.
Are you saying that those who write about contemporary poetry must
sell it to each other rather than weigh it in their own personal scale
of values?  That the aim of writing about poetry is to boost the recognition
level of your own friends and allies?  Do you think there's no point in
distinguishing between reviews treating friends and associates and reviews
done cold?  Clearly a general understanding of poetry according to you
is beyond the reach of the ordinary grad student, much less the ordinary
citizen (I haven't been to grad school myself, so I'm not the one to judge
there); reviews therefore will be a minor, generally worthless venture -
there's bigger fish out there, right?  But one implication of what
I've been trying to drum into this list is that if critical values were
more honest, and yes, INDEPENDENT, said critics might just find an avenue
of access to a general public for poetry, and your examples of poets
we need to "learn to read" might find a wider, more educated audience.
But as long as poets, editors, and academics deny the value of
"keeping one's distance", they will continue to write only for themselves.
Maybe deep down that's what they want - save the secret knowledge for the
elite.  Nevertheless, I don't want to give the impression that being
"independent" is simply a vehicle for reaching a wider audience; that's
only a side effect.  I have been frankly dumbfounded at some of the
responses to my posts on this list.  Utterly amazed that the simple
principles of honest writing are considered unknown, needless, irrelevant
matters; that the concept of weighing the values of a work of art
according to autonomous personal values would be called pompous,
naive, hypocritical, etc.  & you're the icing on the cake, Don Byrd.
I am stunned. If he speaks for a general consensus on this list, I
say, you people can have your fishbowl.  It's not worth the water
poured into it.  - Henry Gould

yeah -- seems to me the best criticism, reviews and elsewhere, answers not
"for whom the bell tolls" but "how it makes that particular tone when
struck that particular way" / close reads that give us Poetry by showing
how the chosen poetry resonates -- meaning i guess i agree / how hard is it
though, critics out there, to detach oneself from the promotion, really? /
seems one's selection of subject matter alone communicates preferences /
but i missed big sections of this thread, so i might be a dollar short, etc.

Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

At risk of using the list as a Dear Abby column, I seek advice regarding the
sending of love poems. Valentine's Day is next Saturday. I don't plan to
send out any love poems and here's why.

I was dating this girl for a while. Things were going well. I took her to
see David Bowie. We talked about stuff. We had crazy nights. We even went to
a friend's wedding together. I sent her, like, a poem a week, or something.
I also sang to her over the phone. Then I sent her a poem by Andre Breton
(see below). She freaked out. Our relations broke off within a week.

It wasn't the singing. Suddenly, she said I was a weirdo. It was the Breton.
But the one of the first poems I sent her was by Clark Coolidge!

What gives?



My woman with her forest-fire hair
With her heat-lightning thoughts
With her hourglass waist
My woman with her otter waist in the tiger's mouth
My woman with her rosette mouth a bouquet of stars of
        the greatest magnitude
With her teeth of white mouse footprints on the white
        earth
With her tongue of polished amber and glass
My woman with her stabbed Eucharist tongue
With her tongue of a doll that opens and closes its eyes
With her tongue of incredible stone
My woman with her eyelashes in a child's handwriting
With her eyebrows the edge of a swallow's nest
My woman with her temples of a greenhouse with a slate roof
And steam on the windowpanes
My woman with her shoulders of champagne
And a dolphin-headed fountain under ice
My woman with her matchstick wrists
My woman with her lucky fingers her ace of hearts
        fingers
With her fingers of new-mown hay
My woman with her armpits of marten and beechnuts
Of Midsummer Night
Of privet and angelfish nest
With her seafoam and floodgate arms
Arms that mingle the wheat and the mill
My woman with rocket legs
With her movements of clockwork and despair
My woman with her calves of elder tree pith
My woman with her feet of initials
With her feet of bunches of keys with her feet of
        weaverbirds taking a drink
My woman with her pearl barley neck
My woman with her Val d'or cleavage

Cleavage of a rendezvous in the very bed of the mountain
        stream
With her breasts of night
My woman with her undersea molehill breasts
My woman with her breasts of the crucible of rubies
With her breasts of the specter of the rose beneath the
        dew
My woman with her belly of the unfolding fan of days
With her giant claw belly
My woman with her back of a bird fleeing vertically
With her quicksilver back
With her back of light
With her nape of rolled stone and damp chalk
And a falling glass that's just been sipped
My woman with her rowboat hips
With her hips of a chandelier and arrow feathers
And the stems of white peacock plumes
Her hips an imperceptible pair of scales
My woman with her buttocks of sandstone and asbestos
My woman with her buttocks of a swan's back
My woman with her buttocks of springtime
With her gladiolus sex
My woman with her sex of placer and platypus
My woman with her sex of seaweed and old-fashioned
        candies
My woman with her mirror sex
My woman with her eyes full of stars
With her eyes of violet armor and a speedometer needle
My woman with her savannah eyes
My woman with her eyes of water to drink in prison
My woman with her eyes of forests forever beneath the
        axe
With her pale eyes of sea-level air-level earth and fire

Bromige is neither of those things. He is a noble soul, and he is always
fair and thoughtful. He looks good in a straw hat, and behind the wheel of
a 1963 Lincoln. He has nice long hands and good fingernails. He is a
faithful friend and an unusually perceptive reader. He is a good father and
brave poet. And he is my pal.

Avant-barde poets are nothing more than fiddlers with their own strings,
players with their own poop, self-regarding nincompoops with the
intellectual capacities of plaid-wearing baboons.

In a post ignored by many about period style I noted that the first
poem by Bruce Andrews I ever read was published in the Paris Review,
chosen by Tom Clark (at least Tom Clark was the poetry editor of the
Paris Review at the time, and its hard to imagine George Plimpton picking
Bruce's works though not impossible I confess).  it seems to me that this
is a measure of evidence that the issue at hand is not aesthetic.

I don't know the "Stalin as linguist" essay, but this constant harping on
the Hitlerian or Stalinist methodology of TC is a little grating.  I am
probably not the only one on the list who can say this, but I have lived
in a neo-Stalinist society and the ad hominen attack is one
characteristic of Stalinist polemic.  It would not surprise me if TC, in
either the Poetry Flash or Partisan Review or whereever, used Stalinist
argumentation, but it doesn't further anyone's understanding to use it
back at him.

Underlying most polemic in Stalinist society was stuff like envy,
resentment, you attacked my friend or even attacked me so I will crush
you in return, etc.  It was always difficult to learn what the original
pretext, even, of an attack was -- did Jiang Qing really send those
people to jail because they knew her as a young actress, or was it how
they treated her when she was a young actress, or what?  Part of it is
just power, and the smaller the stakes, the more violent the struggle.  I
don't know what lies at the real root of the anti-Tom Clark emotion that
occassionally erupts on the list.  I have trouble thinking of him as the
"real enemy," that's all.

Four poets were just arrested in Guizhou, for planning to start a
magazine.  Anyone else on the list hear about it?  Anyone know where
Guizhou is?

        Henry--

        What is the reason for losing your cool when people disagree with
you?  We're all expressing our positions as straightforwardly as we feel
them. Obviously, this issue matters a lot to you--as it should (and I
respect you for it)--but you know full well that speaking your mind means
that others will do so back. I do know that there's something about e-mail
that encourages displays of anger (I've done my share), but I think in
this case we're all trying to proceed civilly.

        Let me be perfectly clear. I am not aware of having EVER
claimed, in print, to like the work of someone whose work I do not like,
to advance my career or anybody else's. Hell--what career do I have
anyway, when it comes
to that? Your suggestion that this is what ALL poets and critics are doing
is generalized and incorrect. Your suggestion that we are all DUPES of our
cultural investments is insulting. You seem like a nice guy, and I know
you don't MEAN to be insulting in this case--you think your position is
correct, and you are mystified that others do not agree. But others DON'T
agree, in this case, and are quite independently able to say so. I
and many others are perfectly capable of deciding what we don't like, and
why, and being honest with ourselves about it. Does this really seem
strange to you, that there would be other and perhaps many other
sophisticated, intelligent, and critically insightful folks in the world,
who quite correctly don't see themselves as dupes?


        I feel completely capable of saying exactly what I mean, and of
considering, ethically, what the consequences for myself and others of
such action is. And I will say what I mean to whoever it matters to say it
to. But I do not think that the sense of "independent critic," as you are
using it, takes sufficient account of the complexity of what it means to
be human and involved.

One of the great problems, Henry, with all your posts on this topic, is
suggested by your word-choice here.  One of the most central and important
things about the poetry scene most of us inhabit, is that it's *not*
about selling. You define the whole world of poetry activities as about:
boosting; recognition; selling; markets.  The list of negative and
capitalist-oriented buzzwords that can be derived from your posts, is
scarifying.  This has to be said once and for all, because there seems to
be an awful lot of confusion wafting around about it:  choosing to do
poetry *removes* a person from the capitalist cash nexus in most respects.
I try hard to see this as a positive thing, like bohemians of old.  but
there's no getting around it: it's a deeply destructive and painful
thing.  People find it very hard to live.  A few mainstreamers get grants,
etc., but in general there is no connection between material gain,
comfort, the capitalist marketplace in any usual recognized sense, and
poetry.  This is *very* different from music, mainstream narrative
fiction, the visual arts to an extent, the performing art activities to a
large extent.  My own past involvement with music on a professional level
gives me some sense of the differences involved.  Thus my insistence on
being supportive where possible.  In the accents of my native Northeast,
Poets, they got enough to worry about, already!  Sure, much about ego etc.
is at stake.  Big F'ing deal.  I honestly don't think the push and pull
between different tendencies of poets is as bad a thing as your posts
suggest.  It's probably a good thing.  The *last* thing we need are
"independent critics" to act as arbiters.  Let a thousand groupuscules
bloom.  Let 'em argue out poetics, politics and the rest of it.  If people
with similar work as poets help each other, that's fundamentally a good
thing.  But it sure has nothing to do with "selling".  One of the
important things about this list is the ability of poets to hash out ideas
and preferences, and to point to work that represents what they value.

Tom Mandel:

I responded to your post yesterday, but for some reason it never made it to
the list.  Hopefully this one will.

First of all, I don't see how anyone can better their *careers* as a poet by
standing up for Tom Clark.  That's more like suicide in certain company these
days.

You might actually *read* the articles in question, both 'Stalin as Linguist
essays, before you go too much further out of your way condemning the man
as a fascist.  He addresses a herd-like behavior among a certain group of poets
at a particular moment in time.  He was responding to various pressures of the
day.  It's all quite clear if you just check out what he wrote.  It might
complicate your ad hominem impulses.

Tom is more than capable of standing up for himself and I shouldn't be the
one to speak for him (but he's wise enough to avoid this list, unlike me).

But I do want to defer to you, to help ease the vehemence of your feelings abou
t this.  I'm sure you feel an extraordinary amoun of pain at the loss of your
family.  And I do not want to in any way detract from the dignity of you feelin
gs about this.  Nor do I want to see Tom Clark unfairly accused so casually.
He has a certain amount of dignity too.  If you want to discuss Tom's work, the
way Joe has been doing to eloquently, I think that is fine.  But this kind of
ritual blood-letting is really destructive to more than just Tom Clark.

    Great POST, Rob Hale. Even though I cannot offer you advice, I guess
    it depends on the woman. I remember being in Pierre Joris' class a
    couple years back and having been so thoroughly inundated in a certain
    kind of "feminism" had internalized this idea that FREE UNION was a
    sexist poem, would certainly not (to paraphrase Moxley) "agitate the
    beloved into loving you" and sure enough the smartest and most
attractive (to me) women in the class told me they loved that poem
    so there's no formula
    but i do think much of my poetry is "about" the tension between
    respect and even passion for feminism (though i am skeptical that
    there really can be a male feminist) on the one hand and one's
    status as a "male desiring subject".....
    and though i don't really wish to once again be accused of being
    a languagepoetbasher, this issue was something i found lacking
    in many of the male langpos. well i have a lot more i could say on
    this, but i will wait to digest the implications of your message rob.
    Your message was quite courageous. thanks, chris stroffolino

Mark,  I'm trying to challenge you people.  I feel like somebody who's
just discovered the obvious.  I hadn't given it much thought either until
it seemed to be staring me in the face.  & the obvious sometimes makes
emperors with no clothes of us all.  there's more enterprise in going
naked, as Yeats put it.

Someone may challenge me someday, & I may take it as an insult too.
This email medium is something we're all getting used to.  Henry the
Bull has abused it more than most - the bull can be a bully.  But
if I've offended you or Don Byrd personally I apologize.

My feeling is that the ideal conversation - whether in person or on
email - has something tough as well as fair about it.  Without that
you lose a lot of the humor.  God is no respecter of persons, as it's
written - why should we pamper each other?  Why do I think of the Russians?
They are terrible people - but they know how to cut each other to pieces -
intellectually, satirically - without OFFENDING each other or breaking
friendships.  Joe Ahearn was right about the low calibre of poetic insulting
in our day and age.  Is this another symptom of overall backscratching?
But I'm not interested in ad hominem & all that.  I'm just seriously
taken aback & as a result I am vehement. Call it a rhetorical ploy, if
you will. But I consider it worth fighting for.

The fact is, I think you all ARE sold out, bankrupt, blind, mealy-headed
whippersnappers.  Ben Carrelis thoroughly deconstructed Henry the Bull's
"idealistic" rhetoric.  Yay Aussies!  But Henry's not being dreamy.
He's somebody guarding a line.  THEY SHALL NOT PASS.  I can dig that.

I want to tell people about a new hobby club I've joined called
Peasle Collecting.  Peasles are those small red buttons that used
to be worn by IWW lefties & other working class heroes from 1867-1943.
There are clubs springing up all over the US; they're really fun and
nobody tries to put you down because you can't buy or sell peasles,
they are out of the capitalist system.  Billy Haberson is the
biggest collector in my area - he has 47 DIFFERENT PEASLES in many
shapes and sizes.  A lot of people are jealous but Billy doesn't
make fun of anybody even if they're beginners & only have one or two
peasles.  There's a newsletter called PEASLES UNITE that you can get for
FREE from Jackie Snipp - I'll backchannel you the address if you want.
But it would be nice if you sent them a few bucks for postage - it's
really a shoestring operation. PEASLES UNITE!! - Henry Gould

I read Don Byrd's post from yesterday with some interest. I remember my

I can't agree that the lag between academia and contemporary poetics is

the 1920s and 1930s (or even 50s) and look for the equivalent.  While I
don't want to say everything is great in academia (far from it) I am

because there is relatively little money to be made being a poet, many
poets find themsleves within the academy, making a paycheck that keeps the
roof over one's head and they computer plugged in, or at least the penicls
sharpened.
once within the academy, poets are asked not only to teach "creative
writing" but also "poetry" courses--they are asked, in effect to become
critics.  to become critical enough to be able to pass onto students
poetry, to be able to say this is a peom because it does _x_; this poem
reflects "modern angst," "the romantic self," "postmodern sense of play."
we can debate the value of this kind "criticism," but i think it shows
where poets, poetry, and criticism insersect in this world where poets
often must becaome critics.

which is to say that poets and critics are by necesity often the same
folk.
and i find  that the criticism in the one constantly influences the
poetry in the other

i tell my students that writing happens in community, not alone.  the
academy, criticism, poetry, poetics--these are all communities, and for me
they are all very provocative communities, communities which encourage me
to write, inform my writing, criticize my writing, welcome my writing--i
doubt i could be a poet--or a critic--w/o them.

and, i reiterate, the criticism ever reinforms the poetry, just as the
poetry ever rearranges the criticism.

University press publications by Perelman, Bernstein et al are part of the
 problem addressed.  Critics parading as poets parading as...  The American
academy stinks and has stunk from day one.  That it is somehow sympathetic
to langpods reveals how bankrupt their project has become.  It's a bore all
around.  The universities have never been sympathetic to the vernacular and
so langpo dismantled WCW's ground breaking work on that scale and cashed in
on a language of reductive, conceptual space dust.

agreeing w/ chris s., it is a great poem;
speaking as a particular woman (which the response depends on)
i think i'd mixed messages if it were sent to me.
it is not just a sexist poem, but an imperialistic poem
i don't think anyone want to be referred to as "my woman"
(maybe an under-30's understanding of this) But to be "my
woman with" -- especially when "my woman's" (and not at all
"my"/mine)  attributes are all physical -- so exposed, granted
no privacy, no complexity, no emotion -- at least not any
autonomous privacy, complexity, emotion.  Made
HIS mystery only, inspiring his emotions,
descriptions (& yes some amazing language)
but that's all.  its sort of like a vivisection

& on the other side of it -- a response might
be to the hyperbole of it -- which of course makes
it an amazing poem, but not so much a flattering
set of utterances.

--yes--
or rather the feminine rubric, as cixous' idea has more to do with
the biological fact of writing out of a woman's body; which, more
generally speaking, maybe has more to do w/a certain attention
one produces to their material conditions in the world; Maybe all
experimental writers feel "feminized" by their culture, in the sense
of being put in a place of objectness (e.g. the consumer, the client)
or powerlessness (the debtor, the constituent). Cixous, btw & to the
dismay of many, eschews a feminist label, preferring to align herself
with a Derridian theory of difference.(as Irigaray also has more
recently come to do).

The question maria's & rachel's responses raised for me is:
we can theorize (Butler & Rubin as Pat points out) a more postmodern
feminism, we can, in writing (which is the same as theorizing) practice
it (re DuPlessis' _Pink Guitar_ ; Scalapino's sense of recent women's
poetry constructing a "women's kind of attendance to the object" an
"opportunity or context of apprehension" rather than constructing
a subjectivity -- but in the practice of our everyday lives . . .
there, yes, it is literally a difficult terrain to negotioate, where
things don't seem to change much.  Perhaps they change enough
(thinking both of Joan Retallack's notion of Poethics, and of chris
stoffolino's response to Robert Hale's love poems -- his attempt in
hiw work to pay attention to feminist/male subjectivity tension)

Sounds like a compliment to me.  God forbid everything I right is all
identical and boxable.  Perhaps that's part of why we're poets instead of
something easily categorizable like musicians...

Dear Robert Hale,

Number one--the poem is good, but...surely you do see how such a poem =
objectifies women? The woman in the poem is not an equal, but a possession.=
 And she's not a whole person, but rather a list of favorite parts. =

Number two--I can't imagine a woman alive who doesn't grimace at the =
description "rowboat hips" or, worse, "buttocks of sandstone and asbestos."=
 =

This is not a love poem, it is a statement of ownership. If you really =
want to send a love poem, why not write one yourself? Or stick with =
Shakespeare--he's already been test-marketed and proven effective.

A final thought--brevity is crucial. The longer a love poem goes on, the =
more chances it has of saying something stupid (sorry for the =
unintentional echo of a Frank and Nancy Sinatra song).

With advice to the lovelorn, this is

Doug

Henry--

Personally, I found Evans' essay extremely "liberating" as an
"emerging" poet--

It strikes me that one of the primary theses of that piece--one which
appears most forcefully at the start of the essay--provides younger
writers with a way out from under any detrimental criticism that might
come their way.

To be more clear: Evans suggests vis-a-vis Hegel that one of the reasons
for the regular dismissal of "the avant-garde" is that a lot of the work
they do is as yet invisible to the eyes of those steeped in the
"ideologies" (I don't think this is the right term, but it'll do) of their
times. In other words, avant-garde poets don't get any credit because a
lot of the work their doing is (1) unrecognizable through the political,
aesthetic, and institutional lenses of the time, and (2) perhaps not even
"substantive" as so much of their energy must be spent simply
"escaping"--or reinventing-- the assumptions of the time. Thus, the
more established (traditional, mainstream, what have you) aestheitics of
the time are able, perhaps, to "produce" more, and more visible works--

(An image I get here through a Marxist lens: that mainstream writers
already have an aesthetic "factory," so to speak, at their disposal--they
have access to a predetermined means of (artistic) production--

Innovative writers, however, must manufacture the machinery anew--)

The implications for younger writers here are astonishing--

That perhaps "older" writers--even those of the avant-garde variety--may
also be unable to fully "see" (perceive is probably a better word) the
"new" in the younger generation's works--

Perhaps the "older" writers might claim that the young ones are "lazy,"
"apathetic," etc. (sound familiar?), because they cannot "see" the work
that goes into simply "emerging"--

Evans doesn't make such arguments explicitly--but I think these analogies
are more than available (particularly in light of the postscript in which
he basically credits such writers as Brown, Jarnot, Moxley, Spahr,
Stroffolino, and Rothschild for, in some regards, freeing "the
avant-garde" from the aesthetic prison (not intentionally a prison, but an
effective one none the less) of Langpos. Breaking out of prison is hard
work! And usually happens when no one is looking.

In other words, I think that this essay represents PRECISELY the
kind of criticism that "Rod Smith's Generation" might need--

These rules seem to contradict each other, Henry. Sending to mags and
contests doesn't absorb any energy? Do introverts write lots of essays?
Send to contests? (Emily--)

It seems to me that "taste, judgement, freedom, and artistic instinct" are
also forms of baloney.

I will be in NYC 25-28 of April and would like to do a reading to promote =
my book TEA (Wesleyan Univ. Press). If anyone knows of a venue that would =
be available, I would greatly appreciate the assistance. I will be reading =
here in San Francisco at A Different Light on 22 March, at Wesleyan Univ. =
on 29 April and at Prairie Lights in Iowa City on 1 May. =

Thanks,

While David may not be responding directly to your interpretation riff, he
IS reading the poems that you praised for their plain statement in a way
that differs markedly from your reading of them.  (At least I assume it
differs: since in keeping with your claim that the poems are transparent,
you just pointed at them, rather than offering any reading.)  Your initial
response to his failure to accept the poems in the same manner as you did
is that he's being ungenerous.

Your further response is to quote more of the poem (further pointing) and
quibbling about minor points.

To respond to your earlier question, there was consciously ambiguous
writing long before Empson, going back at least to Defoe & other early
novelists.

As for reading texts in ways that counter the original intentions, well,
that goes back at least a couple of thousand years.

Dale,

I think the vulnerability you respond to is based more on your knowledge of
Tom Clark & where he's coming from than anything in the cited poems
themselves.  & the various sensuous pleasures we all find in poems are
matters of taste, and far from absolute.

As to generosity, you're correct in stating that you've been more than
generous with your positions.  However, you've been far from generous in
accepting that other readers among your peers could honestly find fault
with your oft-stated opinion of Clark & Dorn's stature as the true living
ascended masters of the universe.

People will read the poems or they won't.  They'll write about the poems
here (or elsewhere) or they won't. They'll like the poems or they won't.
No amount of name calling or bullying will change that.  Poems (& poets)
shouldn't need bodyguards.

If you can't accept that other poets can honestly differ with your opinions
on "two of the most brilliant and dedicated men to engage the art of verse
this century", it isn't the fault of these other readers, but with your
unwillingness to allow for differences on the issue.

There's 600 people on this list.  We don't all agree on anything
substantive, we're certainly not all going to agree with you on something
like this.  We also don't all agree that Barrett Watten is the living
embodiment of Shakespeare, Dante, and Homer.

If you search the archives of this list as you propose, you will find
several discussions of Clark & Dorn as bad men, just as you'd find several
discussions of the evil rise of language poetry in the Bay area 20 years
ago.  But you'll also find Ron Silliman including a book by Clark in a list
of books he wishes were in print again.  You'll find David Bromige was the
first to note that Clark's Junkets on a Sad Planet were published in book
form in response to a query on a recent verse biography of Keats.  You'll
find Gunslinger coming up in a very recent discussion of books that might
excite usually bored students in introductory literature classes.

The us-them binary isn't as simple as you wish to make it.

Let me get this straight--that people in universities study language
poetry reveals that they are beyond the pale--then presumably those who
dismiss language poetry, for the same reasons that Dale M. Smith does
(what does the edu on his or her e-mail address stand for by the way?) are
perhaps indicative that the university is not as rotten as all that.
There are enough people in the university with enough common sense to
dismiss "a language of conceptual, reductive space dust" (who is being
reductive here?) in favor of the pure williamcarloswilliamsian Amercain
vernacular.  Thank god! No matter that Coolidge, Howe, and Scalapino
(among others) are vernacular poets in the  profoundest sense.

But perhaps Dale Smith is not really in the university, appearances
notwithstanding.  One of those people who are not "real" academics because
they are still pure of heart.

Maybe part of the problem of change vis-a-vis the postmodern subject -
and specfically the postmodern feminine subject - can be summed up by  a
quote form Nancy Hartsock which Charles Altieri uses to preface  his
_Subjective Agency_ :
(I paraphrase) "Why is that it just when minority groups decided to no
longer be objects of history but subjects that the whole idea of the
subject suddenly became problematic?"

Why indeed? I haven't read Altieri's book yet, so I don't know how he
addresses this. I'd venture to say, though, that the absence of a
precedent, of a history, of a blueprint, while confusing, can also be
liberating - a chance to write a new map for femina cognita. It's
interesting that Cixous declines to place her project under the feminist
banner, opting instead for a broader and decidedly more abstract one.
This highlights one of the big differences between French feminism and
American feminism, as I understand it: that the former is more
philosophically-driven, the latter more politically-driven - and the gap
between them seems to be widening.

These are all rather obvious observations and the question remains: what
then must we do?

yes - I think DeBeauvoir objected to Breton's romanticism on more or
less the same grounds: woman as object of mystical infatuation and
reverie. Though I confess I was much taken with this poem when I was 21.
And I sympathize with Robert Hale. The best thing to do is to give
someone your own poems, I think. Then if those are rejected, you can
have a great time getting drunk and feeling gloriously bitter (not that
I'm making light of yr situation...). My first wife thought my poems
were crap - and she was probably right, but she was also very harsh. My
second wife loves them - but then, I've improved somewhat. In the
interim between them, such offerings were usually met with baffled
silence and/or polite horror.

agreeing w/ chris s., it is a great poem;
speaking as a particular woman (which the response depends on)
i think i'd mixed messages if it were sent to me.
it is not just a sexist poem, but an imperialistic poem
i don't think anyone want to be referred to as "my woman"
(maybe an under-30's understanding of this) But to be "my
woman with" -- especially when "my woman's" (and not at all
"my"/mine)  attributes are all physical -- so exposed, granted
no privacy, no complexity, no emotion -- at least not any
autonomous privacy, complexity, emotion.  Made
HIS mystery only, inspiring his emotions,
descriptions (& yes some amazing language)
but that's all.  its sort of like a vivisection

& on the other side of it -- a response might
be to the hyperbole of it -- which of course makes
it an amazing poem, but not so much a flattering
set of utterances.

Dear Simon (that IS your first name, yes? And your server reverses them
the way mine does?):

Thank you for this eloquent and sadly un-obvious post. It makes perfect
sense to me and I wish its sentiments to travel widely ("Go, little book
. . ."). As one who has also used labels like "fascist" loosely, and who
has been corrected for such usage by residents of the formerly communist
nation of the Czech Republic, I propose that participants of this list
TRY to watch their language (who else but us?)

As you say, "Stalin as Linguist" was Tom's title -- so technically it
was he who first used that particular brush -- but your post contains so
much wisdom in a short amount of space ("the smaller the stakes, the
more violent the struggle") that I can only recommend that people read
it again. Thanks.

Robert, it's a great poem, albeit with all the issues addressed by Rachel
etc.  But, uh, not to trash your representation of the issue, could it have
not that much to do with the poem?  Maybe she was looking for a way out, and
Breton was the excuse she needed.

Your last statement is too nihilistic for my taste. I think
the "indie critic" is wonderful ideal. Though somewhat romantic.
If such a person exists, no doubt certain biases, theoretical tethers,
bind him/her, no matter how much s/he might strain to be free
of such strictures. I will also note that critics more often quote
poets and poet-critics, rather than other critics. (Anecdotal,
no statistical study to back up this assertion.) Literary criticism
is, as others have said, an artform in and of itself. Yet I believe
there's a natural bias among poets to know what another poet
might think, not what the critic thinks that poet thinks—horse’s
mouth & all that.

        There are no really happy places for poetry right now.  When I was at
the University of Kansas, Jonathan, John Fowler (the editor of R/ft) ran a
wonderful book store a few doors down from the Student Union (in fact, next
door to where "the Great White Dog of the Rock Chalk" in Ed Dorn's poem
"wandered through the door of Western Civilization,") and then John Moritz ran
one next door to the old Rock Chalk Cafe itself, a little further down Oread
Avenue, and when Caterpillar or Io would come in the poets would gather and
talk far into the night. Happily there were people like Ed Grier and Roy
Gridley, great scholars of Whitman and Browning and great readers of
contemporary poetry, who would let me write a dissertation about Charles
Olson. Most of the faculty was not clear about the difference between Charles
Olson and Elder Olson (a name that will be familiar to elders on the list at
most).

        To be sure there are some hiding places.  Higher education, after all,
is a huge enterprise; one will find a little of every thing.  But the
University as an institution has never been a happy place for poets.  Some
legendary member of the Harvard English department, once asked if there were
any poets in the department, replied, "They don't have elephants in the
zoology department, do they?"  Some version of this attitude continues to
prevail.

        In all this talk of criticism, there have been few examples of good
criticism.  I would like to recommend Jed Rasula's _The American Poetry Wax
Museum: Reality Effects, 1940-1990_.  The writing is dazzling, the knowledge
of the field encyclopedic, the judgements, as far as I can see, honest and
fair.  It will make clear why there is so little really good criticism: there
simply aren't many people who know the field.  Something of this order is
required if you are going to have a real criticism.

        Rasula's book is published by a quintessentially academic publisher,
The National Council of Teacher's of English.  How does it change our
judgement of the book that he is also the author of one of the most original
books of poetry of the last 20 years?  _Tabula Rasula_.  I believe he is
preparing now another manuscript of poems for publication.  It has been 13
years since the last one.  Of course, this is not the way to build a career as
a poet, but is it a reasonable way for a poet to go about his or her work?

        It is interesting to note T.S. Eliot published only a little over 200
pages of poetry, some of it fairly slight.  Whitman and Stevens both well less
than 600 pages. Pound, Williams, and HD wrote big chunks of their more
substantial oeuvres after they were 60.

Coincidently, speaking of Dada, it was on Feb 5 1916 that Hugo Ball noted
in his diary that the very first evening at the brand new Cabaret Voltaire
was a tremendous success. 82 years and it seems like only. . . etc etc.

re: Don Byrd's note that many of us younger folks don't know Elder Olson:
actually, I'm quite familiar with the name: he's the guy many of the
old-timers in various EngDepts I have known thought I was referring to
when I mentioned Charles Olson. Leads to some interesting
miscommunications when two people  start talking about poetic form and one
is talking about El and the other Chas Olson.

My respose is much like Linda Russo's: I love the poem, and I love
Breton, but if someone gave it to me (how long were you dating?) I might
get that uh-oh,-he's-gonna-make-me-a-muse feeling, which is awfully
constricting.

I don't think she reacted to its being "out there" (she didn't mind
Coolidge), so much as she might have been unable to understand how you
saw HER in relation to the text (geez, why'd he give me _this_???).
Haven't you noticed that when you give someone (esp. a lover) a poem,
they read it like there's a secret message inside?

I love Breton, but what is it about him that's so creepy? I think
perhaps it's his sense of entitlement.

Katy, I'm glad you got something out of that essay; he's a snazzy writer.
But you don't need a dress-up of Hegel & Marx for the precisely OLD idea
(I mean like, old since Greek & Roman times) that the old fogies won't
be able to understand the youngsters.  Maybe it's just that a card-carrying
"youngster" is saying it for you (& insists on harping on the "generation"
thing just so you don't forget)...  My point was that such advocacy is only
a beginning, if anything.

I think you need to open the mental blinders.  Critic does not necessarily
= "mainstream establishment person out to judge us by outmoded standards
of (baloney) taste".  That is a cartoon of a critic.  In my mind, critic
= "somebody who loves poetry enough to dig into it backwards & forwards,
past & present, and say something intelligent (if subjective) about the
style, mindset, aims, effects, contradictions, connections, strengths,
imitations, originalities, meaning, impact, development... etc of what
s/he reads".  I don't think of standards as a set of hoary rules; I think
of standards as the feel of a good ear for syntax, sound, meaning,
and complexity.  Wouldn't you rather read some of this than various
gang-approval ratings, blurbs, or tossed-off empty retchings which pass
for "criticism?" THAT IS ALL I'M SAYING.

All I meant was, MOST of my energy (like 98%) goes into DOING the poems
(until I joined this list [sigh]).  Does anybody know what I look like?
Seen me gladhanding at conferences?  Reading anyplace outside Providence?
Published much?  (these are rhetorical questions)  Maybe it's because
I only write haiku about buffalo - that could be it. I'm also not a prof,
not a writing teacher, not a grad student, not a novelist, not a journalist,
not a professional poet, not a performance artist; the only wannabee I am

Yes, the word "taste" always leaves a bad taste in the mouth.  I like
baloney better myself.  But judgement, freedom, artistic instinct...
there they go now, off to the next reality... all words become dust
through repetition... anything can be turned into a joke... "the laughter
of fools is like fire crackling under a pot" [Proverbs].

Pat,
        Does your change in estimation re Breton's poem reflect what you said
earlier, i.e., that

"one of the big differences between French feminism and
American feminism, as I understand it: that the former is more
philosophically-driven, the latter more politically-driven"

??

& if so, how? Do you [if you do] shrink a bit from Breton now more for
political or for philosophical reasons? How do you feel about the
widening of the gap between American & French feminisms?

Simon, just want to be clear in front of the List that you do not intend
your gdneral complaint re the cyclical irrational anti-Tom Clark eruptions
to apply to my careful posting re the contradictions in his poetry and his
criticism. If my post struck you as emotional, I hope you also saw the
evidence of what aroused it: the mis-use of Brecht and the
'one-law-for-me-another-for-you' tenor of those of his poems provided to
the List by his fans.

You might want to look at Clark's article "Stalin as Linguist." It's in a
Partisan Review for 1987, no doubt in a library near you.

On the other hand, if you wish to retain the obviously sunny portrait you
have of Tom Clark, you might not.

For me, it is an issue of the mis-use of language by a person whose
abilities should know better, a person in a position to unjustly affect for
the worse the condition of current poetry, thus,sooner or later, society
and knowledge.

It has nothing to do with Tom Clark's person, for who has not basked in his
sunny charm, noted his nifty ability to hear _le dernier cri_ , or been
taken with his fetching ways? I still recall our first meeting--it happened
on the beach at Bolinas, in the late 60's. My wife and I were being
lectured (in a kindly way) by Margot Patterson Doss, doyen of guided walks,
on the varieties of pebble that make up that beach, agates of several
kinds, etc. Tom Clark meanwhile had appeared, accompanied by Lewis Warsh
and, I think, Joanne Kyger. Getting into the spirit of things very nimbly,
Tom Clark pointed to a pair of large tires among the flotsam and cried,
"Two Nymphomaniacs!" --revealing himself already aware of the trouble with
signifiers that was to be the bread-and-water of a generation.

So please do not put the cart before the horse where I am concerned.
Address the issues I have raised first, if you please, before broadcasting
fire-retardant. Because, even though many of us are fond of Tom, it is not
impossible, is it, that so rugged an Outsider might cut a few corners in
his zeal to see justice done, whether west or east of the Pecos? Corners
dear to those of us who prize reason, language, poetry, truth and justice
every bit as much (well, nearly) as Clark himself?   David Bromige.

I've been itching to say something in response to many of the
representations of criticism/academia as some sort of vile enterprise
that lives a sort of parasitic life off of the "real" importance of
poetry.  On the one hand, my response goes something like: hogwash.  All
of us critics get into the game because of the great pay and fantastic
cultural clout allotted to literary critics?  Please... come on.
Whether or not you agree with someone's aesthetic or critical
perspective, the fact is that every academic I know gets into it because
of a love for the work.  I mean, if we were truly opportunists, you'd
figure we'd go after something with some kind of material reward.

Which gets me to the second of probably many hands.  I couldn't agree
more with Henry Gould:

I think you need to open the mental blinders.  Critic does not
necessarily

Joe, I wish I'd had the education you had! You got Jung's theory of
Projection in the fifth grade?! I didn't get it till I'd left high school,
and then, I only got Freud's. I was beginning to suppose I'd lost my
ability to make matters plain, but now I see it is the gap in our
educations that is causing us trouble. I guess if I'd heard about
Projection when I was in knee-pants, it would be old hat to me as well by
now. Whether it contained a grain of truth or not, I'd have put it away
along with other childish trifles. I see that, for readers weary of
zykoanalysis, those of us still trapped in the shadow of Mitteleuropa are
worse than nerds in lederhoesen. I dunno--I just can't help myself! I keep
hearing echoes of what isn't made explicit, in the words people use! In all
that's Yin, I sniff some Yang : all that's Yang, some Yin. (Getting closer
to Jung, now). Face-value is only one way I take people! You mean that
Chuck Hurwitz really would have returned me $100 for every $1 I invested?
You mean money isn't shit, thick rich warm doo-doo forevermore? You think
that someone else's poem means exactly what you say? To another?  You think
when I told my wife I was having trouble understanding stale myth, that
wasn't a Freudian slip?

In another vein, I know that there's no end to reading, where poetry and
other human behavior goes, not for me, and you can well believe it makes me
not easy to live with. So I should probably shut up. But I probably won't.
It was nice of you, Joe, to ask me and my wife to go to the Fair with you,
in Seattle. I hope Poetry isn't going to come between us like the Rock of
Gibraltar--I'd sooner it came between us like a scrabble game.      David

Interesting in most of the responses, and I thank all who volunteered
advice/criticism (Chris Stroffolino, Linda Russo, Doug Powell, Karen Kelly),
is the notion of the great/good poem that everyone seems to love/like, yet
must read a bit tougher (sexist, imperialist) for legitimate
personal/political/identity reasons, especially in the context in which I
was presenting it. That's a weird sensation and maybe that's what is so
ultimately disconcerting about the poem and the manner in which it engages
or alienates the reader. Critiquing surrealist poetry is like critiquing
film a la Christian Metz, how do you effectively critique something you
love/hate, the imaginary signifier. There is a tremendous transference
there, which explains my inability to see the poem as anything other than
something for her, even though I was well aware of its political risks.
Also, what happens to the language when it's delivered as such a message? --
the route as part of a text "loved" when isolated, packed and unpacked, yet
trouble-making when delivered?

Someone suggested that something besides the poem caused the breakup. Not
true. And I like (a strange word here) the idea that a poem can be that
powerful, even if it results in a loss. (I guess I am a weirdo) She wrote me
a letter, by the way, which eluded to the poem as an indication that I felt
more passionately for her than her for me therefore we must end. There was
no mention of offense, though it may have been sublimated in some way, which
is why I posted the list.

I wrote some love poems (as some of you suggested), but there is nothing
like a Breton love poem, and it is a love poem, contrary to opinion,  very
complicated, I think, and emotional (whatever these words mean), all these
things in a very exterior, and arguably, male way. Concrete obscurity
(O'Hara) -- probably not the best thing for a relationship.

Bernardette Mayer has some great love poems. I'll send her's from now on.
(But I won't stop sending Breton). She introduced me to the Coolidge love
poem, which I'd never read in that way. I feel better.

i can only guess that you wanted "my woman with" to translate into
"you"; odd that "my woman with" seems so fill-in-the-blankish
except(!) when a specific "subjectivity" is demanded of it;
i.e. "my susan with" might work  but "i, susan, with" won't.

yes, in the way that it is all cock.  i.e. he loves her with his cock
or with whatever else skin he can glom all over her --
the old standby question -- do you think he respects his "woman
with"? is there a being beneath this mass of female goodness?

exclusion of ? ? ? -- i'm reacting now out of context, of course,

Dear ROBERT

From my P.O.V. as a "female desiring subject" -- my guess would be the
"buttocks of sandstone and asbestos" reference is what did you in.  In
the late 20th century it's beyond kinky, it's proven cancerous.  And
never rely on the wedding date aura as meaningful toward longevity--it's
a proven ruse.

So here's my Valentine offering for the love lorn:

Thirst
        for Jennifer

A poem does not exist until it is written.
The reader experiences it's newness, as
Discovery, the next moment, the same
Poem is ancient, having always been known, somewhere,
Somewhere central.
Needed.
Like this:
The lover does not exist until she has come into view as
Revelation       Creation
You need her--though you’ve
Never seen her before,
Never possessed her.  Once
Excavated, she is permanent,
In your thoughts, the seeing you do
        in your head.   A terrific thirst
Accompanies moments
Without her.  It is
At once         delicious and horrible.
Delicious hope:  this thirst will eventually be relieved;
Horrible what you know: what is possible, or probable:
Eternity of no resolve

All my best Valentine wishes to all

R D Levitsky

Interesting discussion / problem / question, Robert.

Pablo Neruda has many (seems to me) kindred poems.  One wonders to
what extent they may sometimes conjure similar (to those noted, briefly,
on list) reservations.  Octavio Paz, I guess, wrote sometimes in a
not dissimilar manner, but not I think so diehard & prolix as Neruda.
I guess his *Twenty Love Poems & a [whatever it was]* (translated by
WS Merwin long ago) are just a few of the many.  Such poetry gives
unembarassed voice to the textures of subjectivity.  Such things can,
however, prove embarassing, esp. if not cushioned by some sort of
usefully abstracting cultural context.  Troubadorian cultures are very
distant from 90s film & t.v., and it can be hard to find a route of
communication between the twain.  From vantage of the latter, for
former can seem madness / danger.  Vice versa presumably?

Love & aculturation-problems.
Difficulty of arriving at shared language?

So much depends upon a red herring.

Oh, well, I can't resist either: does the phrase "my man" resonate?
Do women never act as if "their men" belong to them? Never exhibit
possessiveness, or objectify? Never fantasize ownership? Does the
assumed [male-only] delight in female body parts have a counterpart in
women? {"What do women want?" asked Freud] Do women desire/delight in/
objectify some aspect of men whose 'wholeness' somehow makes their
appetites acceptable? ["I want your baby"?] A woman, in marriage, has
traditionally taken her spouse's _name_! [All part of a male plot of
ownership, no doubt, but long an object of desire by [poor, misled,
victimized?] women...

I like the Breton as a poem. Does anyone know a poem by a woman about a
man which reveals a female perspective as starkly as Breton's seems to
reveal a male's?

Simon S. refers to (whose?) "constant harping on

grating." ..."if TC, in
either the Poetry Flash or Partisan Review or whereever, used Stalinist

Pointing out that he used it is using it back at him?

Dale Smith says I accused Tom Clark of being a fascist. That's asinine. I
don't even know the man.

Dale also says Tom Clark "addresses a herd-like behavior among a certain
group of poets at a particular moment in time" (viz. in his essays titled
"Stalin As Linguist").

Here, the way people so often do in arguments, Dale makes my point for me.

There was no herd-like behavior, Dale. Yet you refer to it as literal fact,
a literal fact that Tom Clark "addresses."

Finally, you accuse me of an ad hominem argument. No, Dale: when you call
David Bromige a "sniveling something or other" (sorry, can't remember what)
*that* is ad hominem. When I say Tom Clark appropriated words Bertolt
Brecht used against fascism to use them against language poets, thereby
subtly conflating language poets and fascism, that's analysis.

And, in an even more final finality, here's some advice: the more you
"defend" Tom Clark in this instance the more trouble you cause his name. He
said what he said, and time and readers establish the value of the work and
people he slammed. Pointing to pile of dogshit on the floor and saying
"lookat them rare white truffles" may be satisfying to you, but it's no
help to the hound. Better you cite work of his you like. I used to like his
book _Stone_ very much (I hope I'm rightly remembering the title -- esp. as
I can see the cover of the book in my mind!) and his book made entirely
from the vocabulary of Neil Young lyrics (name of that?).

PAX

I make a pact with you, Ron Silliman--
I have admired your poems long enough.
I come to you as a prodigal pup;
Weaned at a dozen fat anthologies.
I am old enough now to make an end.
Whitman broke the new wood,
Pound put in time to carving.
We watch the blasted stumps in the open fields
Leak black ink of American grain.

I make a pact with you, venerable LangPoets--
I have invested in your works long enough.
I look back at you as a honorable bunch
Laying new asphalt over the old roads;
I am old enough now to map an end.
It was you who splintered the carved wood,
Now it is time for recycling.
We have a cool climate and a rich soil--
Don't let the mulcher come between us.

I make a pact with you, my contemporaries--
For to know you better there is time enough.
I come to you with no gifts
But that of mutual comradeship;
I am ready to make friends.
Look around us at all this damned wood,
It is time to sort out what you want.
We have glasses of water nursing new roots--
Let there be communication between us.

by the by, there's a fine essay exploring this topic (strewn w/ some
facts & figs) by Sam Hamill in his essay-book, *The Poet's Work*.

While I've not followed the Gould/Wallace debate in all particulars,
Mark's recent decent self-defense gives pause.  That he's involved in
& engaged w/ poetry that he likes because (truth to tell) he really
likes it, seems clear to the point of near-unarbuability, to anyone
who's attended even a sporadic few of the numerous & proliferous
local readings he's forever organizing & promoting here in DC.

I don't think Henry's notion of the indie-critic is necessarily a bad
one necessarily.  On the other hand, I've certainly noted, in music,
that the really good critical writers usually don't distance
themselves socially from the subjects of their enthusiasm.  Even if
they are (often) frustrated composers taking up the critic garb --
Kyle Gann (of Village Voice fame) being a good instance.

Engagement with the creative work of one's time needn't preclude
various forms of engagement with the makers thereof; in fact, the
idea of objective standards -- the book are pure object sans personal
tegument -- seems a weird one in some respects.  For whom is the
writing written?  (Possibly, a few friends?)  A glance back at the
history of poetry suggests this has many a worthy precedent.

All this puts me in mind of "the song of songs, which is Solomon's."
What sort of reaction did he get with lines like "thy hair is as a flock
of goats, that appear from mount Gilead.  Thy teeth are like a flock of
sheep that are even shorn, which came up from the washing . . ."

Were ruminants sexier in those days?

All right, Israel, I'll chill out on my standards a little.  If you're
a critic, you can meet poets or other critics during daylight hours in
non-alcoholic snack bars.  You can write your own poetry, but only for
translation (by a non-friend) into Navajo.  (Did anyone see the obituary
for the Navajo artist - 90 yrs old - who was a Navajo code-talker in WW II?
Did you know that the general who was part of the battle of Iwo Jima
said the battle could not have been won without frontline Navajos
relaying strategy in Navajo code? This in spite of the fact that most
of them were punished severely all through public school for speaking
Navajo - outlawed on school premises? Everything that rises must converge.)

Somehow I get the feeling some people just are never going to get it.
I don't know what they do when they stand up or sit down to write.
Do you know why "poetry" AND "poetry business" are utterly disdained -
derided - the dudville of American culture?  Precisely because poets
ARE SO AT HOME IN LANGUAGE THAT THEY FAIL TO RECOGNIZE HOW SERIOUSLY
NON-WRITERS TAKE THE WORD - ESPECIALLY THE WRITTEN WORD.  IN THEIR
LITTLE ARTY-FARTY CLUBS THEY'RE PLEASED AS PUNCH IF SOMEBODY THEY KNOW
LIKES WHAT THEY HAVE WRITTEN.  YOU SHOULD TRY TO UNDERSTAND WHAT WRITING
IS LIKE FOR A JUDGE WRITING A DECISION OR A LAWYER WRITING A LEGAL BRIEF
OR A REPORTER DESCRIBING A SITUATION.  YOU SHOULD HAVE A SENSE OF PRIDE
IN YOUR WORK SO THAT IT STANDS APART FROM YOUR SOCIAL RELATIONSHIPS.
PARADOXICALLY, THIS IS THE ONLY WAY THAT CRITICISM (& POETRY) CAN
BECOME A TRULY COMMON GOOD RATHER THAN AN IN-JOKE. SAM HAMILL & HIS
ILK WHO WRITE ABOUT POETRY AS A SPECIAL BREED, A CALLING APART, A
HOLY CLAN OUTSIDE THE PHILISTINE WORLD (IF THIS AS ISRAEL IMPLIES
IS THE GIST OF IT) ARE SIMPLY PIMPS FOR A SUBCULTURE.  POETRY IS NOT
A SUBCULTURE.  - Henry Gould

p.s. you think the idea of objective standards is weird.  Even weirder
is the fact that lines from the Bible keep coming to me unannounced
during this thread.  Like:  "You are the salt of the earth.  If salt
has lost its taste, how shall its saltness be restored?  It is no
better than to be thrown out & trampled underfoot by men.  Have salt
among yourselves, and be at peace with one another."  Or how about
this one (paraphrase from inexact memory):  "And what shall you
give for your soul?  Beware that you gain the whole world and lose
your own soul."

Dan Z, the only poem I can think of offhand that contains "my man" is one
of the early Plath poems about Hughes, the one where he is presented as a
sort of force of nature as he trods about the Yorkshire countryside
flushing rabbits and naming lapwings. The "my man" in that poem never
fails to make me cringe, although perhaps that is only because of
historical perspective/outside-the-poem considerations.

As for women taking husband's names, I confess publicly: the sole and only
reason I took my husband's name was its sound value--it sounded better
with my first name than what I had been going by, and was eminently
pronounceable. (I'm related to Kaczynskis. Ironic foreshadowing.) So I go
into a store to buy a pair of Doc Martens at a ridiculous clearance price,
and I give the worker my credit card, and she says, "Your name sounds
famous." I bask in this for about two seconds, and then say, "Do you mean
the McVeigh who blew up a building, or the McVeigh who got spied on by the
Navy?" She laughs.

I think it rasies real and interesting issues, the Breton poem; and as
Linda Russo has said, it has plenty of good points, which makes its sexism
all the more disquieting (and productive to think about...) Of course on
one level this is very *standard* sexist belittlement for the period.
However it's also very much part of a standard repertoire of images  that
the core Surrealist poets loved.  In the last few days I've been glancing
at Eluard for the first time in a while, and it sure is very close to his
love poems.  In interesting contrast to Breton and Eluard, take a look at
Rene Char.  He doesn't use such (interesting but) uniform and boilerplate
imagery...AND when he addresses a woman there is much more complexity of
tone; the imagery is more unexpected and not quite as likely to be a
1920's update of Petrarchian list/sonnet modes.

In one sense, the problem is inherent in the Surrealist belief in sensory
imagery (mostly, visual imagery) as the basis of poetry.  But that makes
the problem harder to ignore, it's not the source of it..The source of it
is patriarchal politix.

Rereading all of this it sounds pretty harsh; I'd never give my
woman-friend this particular poem, but..I certainly see the appeal of its
energy, and slightly transgressive boldness.  All of which were more
startling and bracing when the poem was written, than in today's culture.
I know feminist women who while they'd be amused at the archaic
objectifying attitudes in the Breton would also appreciate its force as
poetry and not be expecially offended by it.  But that it would be fairly
disturbing to a woman doesn't much surprise me...It's moderately
disturbing to me.

Sylvester,

Posting from another Georgia law school, I have to say that's a moderately
interesting story....Why the heck would a law professor want someone to
track it down?? Must be one of those "law and literature movement" types,
eh?  (Actually, all I've encountered of those folks since entering the
world of law,...it is to snooze.  A more mainstream bunch of depressing
attitudes toward writing would be hard to imagine!)

Is it because the poet was one of those legal poets (most of us aspire to
be illegal, of course)...Reznikoff? Stevens?

well, now that stroff has flushed me out as teaching  twisted love poems
like Breton's, let me submit this: in French it's of course "ma femme" —
the translation I use is Antin's which says "my woman" -- but there
exists another more recent one that tries to p.c.fy (I guess, or else
legalize the free union) the poem by translating "ma femme" as "my
wife." Does that make any difference?

Breton was, is, a marvellous poet -- he was also a tyrannical and
masterful _leader maximo_ of surrealism ( for all you younglings who
feel that langpo was/is somehow an imposition on the landscape, check
out how avant-garde groups were run -- and who was run out of town --
when Breton was waging his poetry wars -- langpo, in comparison,  is a
charitable organisation) and he was — ugh, o tempora, o mores, if I
still have some pig-Latin — a male chauvinist pig of the first order,
even if that poem was adressed to his legal spouse.

All this puts me in mind of "the song of songs, which is Solomon's."
What sort of reaction did he get with lines like "thy hair is as a flock

Don,

I'm delighted to hear that Rasula is going to publish something
soon.  I just spent 6 or 8 months getting the Emory library to acquire and
catalog Tabula Rasula (it is in print folks) and I highly recommend that
people seek it out.  Not much like anything else, and brilliant.  Its use
of typography and drawing and graphic elements makes it germane to the
recent vizpo threads by the way.

As I posted to the list around a year ago, American Poetry Wax Museum is
indeed a really impressive and useful social/critical/historical analysis
of U.S. poetry in the 20th century. It was here on the list that I first
heard of it, I think.  One of the list's many very valuble functions.

a woman taking her spouse's name (?!) as 'long an object of desire for
women'? how long? when, why? it seems to me that to assume a husband's
name hardly compensates for the loss of one's property rights, inheritance
rights, well lets just say legal standing - could ever have compensated
for becoming legally a piece of property, could ever have been part of any
ECONOMY of desire, as Freud might like to narrativize - a very tricky man
, that guy, and quick with a sleight of rhetorical hand - but I've yet to
see a movie ad campaign that strecthes its male lead all over the ad
poster in nothin but a fig leaf (a la Great Expectations- great
expectations!) - no one's even speculating on a 'male polt of ownership'
really, I dont think- something like that would be too ridiculously
sinister, too obviously ludicrous, too easy - the point in part here is,
Linda's point, that to draw distinctions between feminist and non-feminist
by the actual biological sex of a person at this point is silly - and
counterproductive and moreover, feminist should be emptied of this kind of
reference-value at this point - because gosh, woman are taught to desire
possession of women's bodies in a similar degree, if not in a similar
nature, as men-
ecriture feminine can be read as essentialist and exclusive, but why go to
the trouble of such a reading when there is cixous, derrida, delueze,
doing a lot more

hmm right- this is kind of where it gets down and dirty (obvious), right?
- marianne moore's love poems  seem to be lamenting the positioning of
woman as dead babies - see "roses only,' ' your thorns are the best part
of you' - mina loy writes great lyrics about  moon rotting - sylvia
plath you know wrote lots to her father - there just doesnt seem to be
much of a tradition of women writing literally about their muse's (dead)
body - there is , however, a lot of lyrical work out there by women that
partakes of the same strategies, privileged subject positions, as that of
the cold lonely isolated seer-sage-poet who writes over the dead body of
the beloved - which take 'poetry' as a deity and 'poet' as their license
to more or less wave phallus all over the page -


nothing. everything.

Hello, Tom:

>I miss Dan, and I wish he were here so I could throttle him for what he did.

I've been thinking about responding for a week--not that it needs a response;
simple, direct, moving statement that it is. But . . .

well, Tom, no one knows why anyone chooses to commit suicide, but I know Dan
thought about it for quite a while; it wasn't a sudden or rash decision. We had
long talks on the phone about it, and he and my wife wrote back & forth about
it a couple of years before he did it. (She was very much into the Hemlock
Society for a while.) My first correspondence from Dan, in mid-1986, was a
short note: "I was just about to kill myself--then, your letter! Now . . .
something to live for!" not quite direct quote, but very close, & similar in
tone--a "joke." Whenever he would bring suicide up as an option, I would try to
argue against it, but what effective argument can you offer someone who is: (a)
impoverished (Dan lived on $500 SSI checks in an increasingly expensive San
Francisco--he was never able to receive arts grants unless special "payment
arrangements" were made because if he reported it, the gov't would take it
right out of his SSI "income"); (b) suffering physical deterioration (beyond
his heart-valve replacement, & constant migraines, Dan was diagnosed with
hepatitis in early 1996); and (c) as headstrong & often frustratingly
single-minded as Dan was? I mean, I argued w/him about it quite a bit, but
obviously not well enough.

Some have speculated that Dan killed himself as a big "fuck you" (to whom, I
don't know--maybe everyone?), or as a way of directing attention to his work, &
even one person thought he might have done it because the hepatitis was making
him look less-than-attractive. I think--& this is equally speculative--he was
long-fascinated by suicide as an option, probably romanticized it a bit), and
his health & economic situation were growing increasingly difficult to deal
with.

Dan died at the age of 44--the age that too many of my own most influential
20th century artists left: Maya Deren, Paul Blackburn, Lew Welch, and I think
Frank O'Hara (not totally sure about O'Hara, but pretty sure). Any
numerologists out there?

There are many things I wanted to throttle Dan for over the years--if you'd
been at his memorial you'd have heard "Dan was the most difficult person I've
ever known" a bazillion times from as many people--but his suicide wasn't one
of them. Maybe I exhausted myself arguing with him about the "futility" of his
life--no life, I felt, is futile. One thing I could never argue with him about
was what a cold, money- & fame-hungry, spiritually empty, overall fucked up
culture we live in. (One of his favorite topics. He could not NOT write the
kind of poetry he did, nor could not NOT do agit-prop art.) Anyway, I didn't
lead the life he did, don't know with how much dignity I could have lived it,
nor for how long I'd've lasted. Of course I'd rather have him here than not; he
was one of my best friends, I more than loved getting new work from him--I
consistently learned from it--& he was one of the best (& most consistently
honest) readers of my own work I've ever had.

Anyway, Tom, I've got all of Dan's papers, & am about to start looking for a
publisher for _culture_. Any suggestions? Willing to help pitch it? (Not a
rhetorical question.) Also: Anyone who corresponded with Dan, or wrote anything
about his work, or would like to, please back-channel me when you have a
moment--I've been wanting to put together something about his work, assuming
it's of interest to others out there.

Thanks,

what's so "tricky" about Freud?  In my experiece he's one of the most ethical
and open thinkers of this century --at least, I've always found that to be so.
Will you please elaborate, with textual citations if possible, what "tricks"
he's turned?

Any number of song lyrics, and particularly the blues, which often rises to
antbody's idea of poetry. Check out Bessie Smith's "Empty Bed Blues"--"My

oh fr heavens' sake. women didn't "take" their husbands names in the sense
of usurping and colonizing them; their husbands' names were forced on them
as insignia of those husbands' ownership of those wives. i'm sorry, but to
claim otherwise is simply either disingenuous, an attempt at rhetorical
provocation, or so staggeringly naive that further discussion of equity
between genders is pointless.

Ruminants have always been sexy.
The Song of Songs was written for an audience whose members would have had
an immediate visual association with the imagery. So, that tightly-packed
flock of goats undulating across the mountain in the distance could call to
mind the flow and movement of hair, and the sheep, in a snowless landscape,
would have been the paradigm of whiteness (as swan's down is for Jonson in
"The Ode to Charis"--another nearly obsolete image). The elder tree pith is
certainly recherche but probably refers to the lady's tan.

Hi Dan.

When I think about it, I guess my feeling for Breton waned a long while
back without my really noticing it much. So I couldn't say it's driven
by a particular decision or attitude arrived at after the consideration
of such factors as his sexism, or whatever. My favorite French
surrealists were always Eluard and Desnos, and then later, Char.
That's not to stay I don't have a soft spot for the Sur-Commandante.
Just last week I bought a used copy of the _Manifestos_ -  (sold the old
one in a periodic purge to buy new books). It was a very important book
for me once upon a time and had a tremendous effect on the way I thought
about poetry, about language. So I honor Breton for that.

As for the gap between American and French feminism, I'll have to get
back to you on that - I  just don't know enough to make an intelligent
comment on the situation. From what little I've read, there seems to be
a perception, at least here in the US, that French feminists have moved
so far into the poststructural camp as to neutralize the enactment of
any coherent political agenda. And that's because the political front of
feminism has thus far relied on - in a sort of gentlewoman's agreement -
to set aside the issue of essentialism vs. constructionism, and for the
sake of promoting specific socially progressive programs, etc. acted as
though there were no ontological rift, that something called the
"universal woman" exists and can be appealed to in arguments with
legislators and the like. It's a very interesting problem.

Pat,
        Does your change in estimation re Breton's poem reflect what you
said
earlier, i.e., that

"one of the big differences between French feminism and
American feminism, as I understand it: that the former is more
philosophically-driven, the latter more politically-driven"

??

& if so, how? Do you [if you do] shrink a bit from Breton now more for
political or for philosophical reasons? How do you feel about the
widening of the gap between American & French feminisms?

Bees' slow honey

George, Your point is well-taken, _if_ when you wrote "if these were a
man's words" you intended "if these were a woman's words"--a reading that
the context urges. And I would agree, that _once again_ , it is a man's
"trip" (or 3 different men, actually) being "laid on" women. I was
off-point, somewhat--although Fanny Brice, a woman, made it a big hit.
"Buying in", I suppose. David

It might be interesting to compare Barrett Watten's Bad
History IX, "Presentation" (see Antenym #14) to the Tom
Clark excerpt Joe Safdie posted Jan 24 (recently reposted
by David Bromige). Coincidentally parallel subject matters
in both poems, with very different treatments (as would be
expected). Both seem to write of peer pressure & peer
pleasure within overlapping, "warring" poetry communities: Watten,
from the viewpoint of a shared poetic tendency (always
plural, never singular); Clark, as someone who claims to
have miraculously eluded all tendential poetic groupings
(always singular, never plural) - as David has so excellently,
in my view, recently detailed for us. Perhaps Steve Carll,
who edits *Antenym*, could post that section of Watten's
poem, if he's here? There is no "good" and "bad" in this suggested
comparison, either - even though I side with David's view on Tom's
poems - because Watten's poem is itself, it strikes me, oddly
ahistorical in its address to a generality - "they." ...I'd be
curious to know what others think.

During so much of the recent discussion I have gone back
tangentially and for a sort of touchstone for my own
thinking to a "chapter of verse" in Bob Perelman's poem by
that name to be found in his last book, *Virtual Reality*. I
wonder who on this list finds this quotation, in the way that
it negotiates values for the social through various "walls"
of individualism, to be a compelling one, or even an
interesting one. It's a seemingly real plain statement:

"Poetry begins, not between individuals within a
community, but rather at the points where communities end,
at their boundaries, at the points of contact between
different communities."

Where are the ends - and are they coterminous with the
ends, as in the goals - of our communities, or are we a part
of the same community even if we take opposing sides on
fundamental issues of poetics? (The latter a question of
scale, to some extent, that Ron critically addressed as an
entropic state of current social affairs, in his PhillyTalks.) What
does it mean to think of "poetry" as *not* "beginning
between individuals within a community" - in other words,
within the same community? "Community" of course can
also be an imaginary construct (if it's ever anything else).

I kind of lump together under one claim some variety of
positions that a number of people on this list have recently
marshalled forth - those positions having to do with
reinvoking that famous "figure of outward" ("figure" as in
figure of thought/speech): the outcasted male individual
hero loner poet-thinker. Perhaps that's a caricature? Still,
the shared claim these positions hold I think is the one that
is swilling the last dregs of that sad legacy of the imaginary
politics of anarchism in the US. In this recent listserve
revival, it has taken such a reified form that its once
communal politics can hardly be perceived - by those very champions
of this view - in the vocabulary used to identify its social
positioning - this given the already vastly reified "social"
landscape of this nation, in the midst of its bathetic
attempts to clutch to such a stripped landscape for support.

Not that anyone will find and of this of interest, but: I
just want to say in advance that at present I can't post to
the listserve as often as I'd like. Please don't take my possible
further silence on these things as mean indifference. Oh no!

Oh, no!

Mais non!

I respond here, not exclusively to Linda, but to her remarks in this note
and another, in addition to numerous posts by others that invite a similar
reading of Breton's "Free Union" along a similar course, that of male power
objectifying and controlling women -- the sway of which I underestimated in
the heat of my picaresque adventure.

I would also venture another interpretation of "exterior" that might lead
somewhere other than the phallus and its well-worked calculus and mass
redundancy. Exteriorization as a "positive task" (Deleuze and Guattari)
working against interiorizing forces -- control, perversion (you name it),
those which "no longer open to any outside." Then exteriorization is the
highest, and albeit most abstract, task of love. I guess I consider this
romantic in the context of my delivery of Breton to "my woman", but as I try
to explicate I realize how ethereal it can be and probably was to her.

There seems to be some consensus over the idea that the love poem must
strive for egalitarian goals, though I think the "heat" I mentioned above
makes this very difficult to achieve. And as Pierre eluded to, the
Surrealists, Breton esp., cared little for egalitarianism or any other such
bourgeois concepts. I am not a Surrealist, but as I recall, a blurb on my
work once mentioned the influence.

To summarize, I quote Mariana Valverde from her "Sex, Power and Pleasure" (a
book given to me by an ex-girlfriend, which I obviously have had trouble
applying in real life -- I keep forgetting that I have lit cigarettes
already as I am writing this so the ashtray has three camels burning
simultaneously in it, all mine!):

"The task is not to reject all objectification in favour of an impossible
ideal of pure subjectivity, but rather to integrate the two aspects of human
existence. The task is to remain a full human subject even while someone is
considering us as a potential erotic object, and vice versa. An eroticism
that is both sexy and egalitarian is one in which both partners are
simultaneously subject and object, for one another as well as for themselves."

This sounds good (utopian?), but I keep forgetting that I have lit
cigarettes already as I am writing this so...

Lastly, what about the use of "My lover" as the addressee? Bill Luoma has
used this quite successfully, I think, in recent love poems of his.

Anybody know how long this custom has been in force (and where and among
which classes)? I'm not sure if Marie-Antoinette was "Mrs. Bourbon," less
sure if the Wife of Bath took her various husbands' names, and I think
what's customary in non-European societies is quite variable. But I don't
know.
Property laws, it's worth pointing out, were passed for the convenience of
the propertied class. Before the Industrial Revolution made a lot of the
old divisions of labor obsolete the lower classes were often more
egalitarian in terms of gender than their "betters."
I hope I'm not being naive in suggesting that while Maria is in general
terms certainly correct these issues are probably far more complex and
nuanced. I await enlightenment.

There is a thread in common with Louis' post and the Clark issue that I
feel is worth following.

I went to read the Tom Clark essay today.  Probably worth mentioning some
things before all is swept away.  The Brecht quote introduces the piece
and is completely contextless, not even a footnote provided, so I have no
idea when the quote was written.  Clark uses it to frame langpoetry as
academic and negatively obscure.  Now that Clark has thrown out context,
that social and historical stuff that induces meaning, he is happy to
provide his own version of context, calling all langpoetry leftist and
group-centered.  He quotes only one poem, a section from a Watten piece,
not to analyze but to show that the title "'Stalin As Linguist'" comes
from Watten (hence the quotes around the title).  We assume the analogy
between group-project and Stalinism and case closed.  The whole thing is
harshly vague and is an example of the kind of criticism I find as
absolute bullshit, the "I hate this, I hate that" criticism.

And, oooh, I find the academic slander particularly compelling.  The fact
that it is on this list in all its glory is sickening.  It's all shit,
let's burn the universities.  Better yet, burn the critic-professors,
especially that Derrida, root of all obscure academic prose.

The example of Derrida interests me very much, as he has been bashed by
Tom Clark as well as several language poets over the years, and of course
by almost every professor and, now, watcher of Woody Allen movies.  I'm
not going to proceed on a lengthy defense here, but I will honestly and
forcefully say that Derrida's writing is powerful, concise, and stunning.
I find his texts on Jewish themes and on poetry to be genuinely intense.
His project is fine-tuned and demanding, and I don't think I would be a
poet or a critic if it were not for his writing.

Maybe it is worth noting Derrida has not spent the majority of his career
in the heart of the University system.  For many years he has held a
"tutor"  position at the Ecole Normale, about the equivalent of what most
grad students get as their first job.  It's also worth mentioning
Derrida's essay "The University in the Eyes of its Pupils" (diacritics,
1983), where Derrida does what he often does to characterize institutions
(and, of course, also with philosophically dramatic terms).  He points out
the tendency to destroy and demolish institutions is always linked with
the tendency to praise and commendably name them.  The essay is very
particular about what this may mean, and most of Derrida, as usual, is
about raising these issues.  There are more questions in Derrida's writing
than most other essays.  Derrida does insist that community and
institution must be re-thought.  In his major essay on Levinas he calls
the context of his critique "the community of the question".

That word "community" is used so often, certainly by me too, that it loses
much of its relevance.  But I use this word to be the real context and
substance of language writing, the context I seem to most admire them for,
a context exactly like what Derrida calls "the community of the question".
Now, Ron Silliman, for example (not to pick on Ron, but his Philly Talk
here still resonates), has recently suggested such a community was a
heroic moment in writing, while I completely disagree with such a heroic
view of history, myself preferring the project of what Greil Marcus calls
"secret history".  Anyways, such heroism should not obscure what is so
valuable in the cliched but genuine project of community.  Even if
communities find foundations in what will ultimately lead to their own
downfall, the search is inherently important.  That search takes place in
the community of the question, and for me it welcomes both Derrida and
language poetry in the *academy turned upside-down* (any reading of
langpoetry and Derrida would be blind to miss the intense criticism both
sustain against the university.  It is some of the best criticism out
there, much better than the solitary and blessed poet trashing all
professors).  But Tom Clark will forever fail to see how langpoetry is a
community (of questionings) and not a totality.

Langpoetry and the University certainly do not present the only results of
community (not even close), and to me, if either of these "institutions"
are to be surpassed, in good faith, it will come by a rethinking of
naming, of grouping, of making context in a socially and historically
changing world.  What is exciting is the ways in which these searches
continue, even in the heart of the worst corners of the worst
public/private education systems, even in the most absurd and inviting
ways.  What if in some perverted way, bureaucracy implicitly lead the way
out of bureaucracy?  What if in some terrible corner of a paragraph or a
library there appeared a clue into a new understanding of community?
Better we should smash it before it adds up to that pile of shit we call
context.

In fact, Rachel, they were. Very much.

As for Solomon's song itself, I liked Mark Weiss's remarks very much. But
the proper answer to your question is that they were. Very much.

And not just ruminants. Have you ever heard of the Vedic horse sacrifice?

Whenever people ask me why I study Sanskrit, I always respond with the
question, "Have you ever heard of the Vedic horse sacrifice?"

It leads to a spirited justification of philology. You poets think you know
things.... But the things I know.... Well.... Like what the horse and the
chief queen did.... Well....

Why, it is even better than Breton.

Thank you, David. Exactly the tune I had in mind when I put "my man" in
quotes.

Perhaps it doesn't mean anything, but if I remember correctly Breton at first
pretended that the poem wasn't his & that it had been sent to him
anonymously(?) in the mail.  The similarity Mark P. sees to Eluard is
revealing (although most Surrealist poetry strikes me as quite similar),
 because when Eluard was shown the poem he immediately declared the unknown
writer a genius & proposed that they launch a citywide search for him in
Paris.

Check out _Investigating Sex_ by Jose Pierre. It is conversations among
Breton, Eluard, et al re: sex, and directly addresses, well, as much as
they were inclined to be direct, the surrealist attitude toward women &
sex & poetry, etc. etc. One thing I found interesting was Breton's
violent homophobia; to him SEX = WOMAN (and, it would seem, WOMAN =
SEX).

You will think I am some kind of Blakean avatar, a brass cube of rectal
rectitude, a meatlocker out to reduce everything to legal jargon & professional
 swordsmanship.  But you will be wrong.

"I am the Lion   left out of your play."

                          *

Here is a Celan poem considered to be addressed (in a sense) to Mandelstam
(trans. Michael Hamburger):

BELOW

Led home into oblivion
the sociable talk of
our slow eyes.

Led home, syllable after syllable, shared
out among the dayblind dice, for which
the playing hand reaches out, large,
awakening.

And the too much of my speaking:
heaped up round the little
crystal dressed in the style of your silence.

--Paul Celan

i'm interested in your statement here, especially given the fact that about
80% of old-growth forest in the U.S. has been lost (most of it to create
land for grazing livestock and/or growing livestock feed) and topsoil
depleted 75% for sake of same (not to mention chemical contamination of
soil and water--fertilizers, etc. to sustain growth) / so i have to admit
the running conceit here ("wood," "rich soil", "water nursing new roots,"
"recycling") resonates oddly for me--not just for its irony, intended or
not / the "American Grain" you refer to and "American Tree" by implication
as well lead me to think that what does separate writers today from the
"Tree" group is precisely our relationship to REsources, figuratively and
literally -- the american tree hasn't just been carved and splintered, it's
been cut down, paved over, then re-paved / planting "new roots" through
this kind of surface and in this kind of soil would be difficult indeed,
probably impossible / hydroponics and tree farms: maybe that's where the
future of poetry lies if we pursue the metaphor

i don't know where you hail from, but having spent some time working on a
farm in Illinois (shutting windows when the pesticide truck comes through,
watching hillsides wash away, cleaning contaminated wells, etc.), i have a
hard time getting past the literal here / but quite seriously whatever pact
is made among writers today i think it needs to account for this new
relationship (to wood and word) / the invitation to "mutual comradeship"
however is gladly accepted

best,
bill marsh

hey, Mark. I thought it was curious too--she said she'd let me know the

So I wrote this poem from an image which comes from a gesture in a movie
and I think it is The Conformist, not sure, must know.  Having a bit of
trouble finding it to rent in the neighborhood, haven't gone further
yet.

Here it is: A man in a black trenchcoat gestures to a woman by placing
his thumb on his lips.  She does the same, perhaps later.  It's French.

Dan died at the age of 44--the age that too many of my own most influential
20th century artists left: Maya Deren, Paul Blackburn, Lew Welch, and I think
Frank O'Hara (not totally sure about O'Hara, but pretty sure). Any
numerologists out there?

bpNichol too, at 44.

I think critics need to be purged of friends. only
people with no friends enough to be objective. I
remember the critics were sent to live in a remote
cabin with just a dog for company, and after of 5
years living they had to kill the dog; I think they
called it Trancendental Meditation. it didn't take
a spousal name to penetrate the economy of de-
sire in that cabin. I know that it's too late for me
["too late for me"] to be a really good critic, but
I'm still inviting you to my party (& you, Kent).

The Bessie Smith lyrics reminded me-- didn't Shirley Anne Williams write a
series on Bessie Smith lyrics?  Does anyone know how or if she brought
attention to the whole "my man" issue?

I'm also reminded of an old movie based on, I think, a Cornell Woolrich (sp?)
novel called "No Man to Call Her Own"--  Barbara Stanwick, preganant and
abandoned, is in in train wreck with couple and is mistaken for the bride,
taken in, falls in love with the groom's brother.

Seems in both cases-- the Bessie Smith lyrics and the movie that the desire
to "own a man" comes from a pretty desperate place in a number of ways
(emotionally, financially, socially).  I'm not sure that I'd equate this with
what's going on in the Breton poem.  Maybe this is less the case with the
Plath poem.

Gary & other followers of the late Daniel Davidson, could someone post a
bibliography of published (and possibily unpublished work). I've been
interested in his work since you (Gary) sent me the collab with Tom
Mandel. Who published that? thanks-jk

Oh for Heaven's sake, Maria. Your posts have always been intelligent and
I've always looked forward to them, but you've lost me this time with your
sweeping generalizations about gender equity. Sorry, but I have to say
this.

My wife took my name neither to be usurped and colonized nor to be a piece
of property, and would find this discussion silly, whatever her reasons
were (and they were her own). Furthermore, she is neither usurped nor
colonized. 17 years ago I put her through university. For 12 years I have
cared for our children and home, put her through graduate school (and did
not go myself), assisted her hugely with her thesis, moved to follow her
job, and I continue to support her in her difficult, all-consuming
professional life daily. I may be so "staggeringly naive that further
discussion of equity between genders is pointless" and she may be too, but
my experience is that roles have as much to do with inequity as do genders:
a man today caring for his children is at as much of a social and political
disadvantage (in fact more of one) than a woman today caring for hers.
Whatever happened in the past, happened, and let's talk about it, let's fix
it as best we can, and if it is still happening, let's fix it now as well,
but let's not claim more than should be claimed. I am not knocking my
choices, because I know they have been good, but if that's not equity and
support, what on earth is? Making her stay home against her will so that
she could look after the children on 1/3 the salary, so that I could grow
bitter and not write? Both of us go to work and send the kids to daycare?
Not have kids? Split up? Tell her she has to take back her maiden name? She
can change her name to anything she wants, any day.

There, I said it.

Actually I love the Song of Solomon--just in case that wasn't clear;
have made ruthless use of it in my own work (as will be evident in a
piece forthcoming in _non_).  Do wonder, though, about the translation
of certain lines, such as "My beloved put in his hand by the hole of the
door, and my bowels were moved for him."  Kinky?

I have to say that I was wooed - entirely successfully - by a
Breton-reading, surrealist-leaning poet who dedicated the first issue of
his first magazine to me (but didn't publish me in it) - after which I
pointed out that I was not content to be anyone's goddamned muse, thank
you very much) and we were together forever till he died -

It's not the Breton - it really depends on the babe -

        Louis Cabri--in taking off from a line from Perelman about
        poetry and its hypothetical location BETWEEN communities
        rather than between individuals--makes an interesting point
        that, for me, raises the question of identity as a differential
        and what may be the "reactive nature" of it (identity).
        For, perhaps we all have some pre-existing idea of what
        this "listserv community" entails, is constituted by
 (though of course it's
        an "imaginary construct")) and there is a very valid
        perspective from which
          "those positions having to do with reinvoking that famous
           figure of the outlaw (figure as in figure of thought/speech)
           : the outcasted male individual hero loner poet-thinker"
           though "a caricature" must be seen in relation to the
           assumptions of the "imaginary construct" of this "listserv
           community." And perhaps the VALUE of such an "outlaw figure"
           position--apart from any question of intrinsic value which
            I am going to BRACKET for now--is precisely in the way it
            may place the tension BETWEEN communities WITHIN a community.
           Thus, maybe it's not coincidental that Joshua Schuster finds
           the fact that "academic slander" can be found in all its glory
           on this list both "sickening" and "compelling". Ah, such
           ambivalence we may locate in the individual Joshua Schuster,
           taking a position against other individuals (in this sense
           the "sickening" is suppossed to take precedence over the
           "compelling"), or we may locate it in between two communities,
            whose "competing discourses" play themselves out in the words
             of (or mind of) Joshua Schuster.
             -----
              Again, I keep thinking of that quote by Mr. Bernstein
              about being a "communist in st. petersburg and a capitalist
              in leningrad". As for me, I don't think I'd say half the
              things I say on this list if I were in other contexts.
              When I was on the CAP-L list alot, i tended to be part of
              a "unified front" with Ron SIlliman strangely enough
              In U-Mass MFA prgram creative writing class with James Tate
              I defended Bernstein. Of course I would defend Tate here
              (and not JUST for reactive reasons, but I'd be lying to
               say such reasons don't play at least some part in it)...
    Anyway, just some friday morning thoughts.....chris

Dear Mr. Durgin,

Your newsletter sounds promising.  From the post above,
I am guessing you are more interested in prose pieces than
poetry at this time.  Are you open to poetry submissions,
and, if so, are there any additional guidelines?

For the past few months I have been considering the
physical page's dimensional impact on poetry's lineation,
how it essentially dictates the width and flow of the
modern poem.  I will be recording my conclusions in an
essay entitled, "8 1/2 x 11," and I expect it to be well
under a 1,000 words.  Would you be interested in such
a piece?

As for myself, I am a poet and an electronic publisher
of free an e-zine and poetry anthologies (see Poetfest
link below).  My works have appeared in a variety of
publications, including English Journal, Amazing
Computing, Poetpoetzine, Midwest Poetry Review,
and EWG Presents.

I look forward to your reply.

Sincerely,
Robert J. Tiess

Stroffolino makes some good points along the Cabri & Schuster thread, mainly
by not insisting on a simple solution (as I so often do).  Though the
poem gets written by the individual it's always in response to a group
situation, even if it's addressed to a single "other" person.  So the
group is always an implicit sounding board.  This goes for criticism as
well.  But I think those who criticize Tom Clark (& me) for playing
the super-individualist card might consider what we're playing it against.
"Talk about" poetry, "talk about" poetry communities, is all well and
good, especially for those (academic) communities for whom such talk
is literally their bread and butter; "isn't it nice to think so," as
Mark Wallace so aptly quoted Hemingway - especially when some poetry
collectives will actively & persistently promote the history &
analysis of their community within the academic community; both groups
get to think they're talking about something important!  Isn't that nice?

All I've been saying, and perhaps all Tom Clark said (I haven't read
it), IS - that, for us, when the chips are down, when the bell tolls,
when the fat lady sings, when closing time comes, at the stroke of
midnight, etc. etc. - my poems - whether they're responding to the group
or not - my poems are my poems.  I wrote them.  Me, the individual.
I put things in them myself.  And when they're written, hey, I still
wrote them.  My poems are different from your poems.  Part of my
effort (& I mean EFFORT) is to make them different from yours.  I see
a major part of the intrinsic value of a poem is its utter uniqueness.
I stand firmly with both Celan & Mandelstam who, again and again,
said (in OM's words) "Do not compare.  The living is incomparable."
You must look for it yourself.

So you can talk all you want about poetic communities.  This list is
a poetic community.  For all I know, it's affected my writing.  But
when I go into the room & close the door to write - a poem, a review,
whatever - I want nothing to do with you.  & I don't want any favors.
I want to reach the "cold" reader, the dispassionate critic, the
average Joanne.  Because they are my criterion for my own truth.
What's your criterion?  The echo of praise, the warm comradely hug?
"Men seek glory from one another, but they do not seek the glory that
comes from God."

Hello, Miekal, Joel, Carolyn & others:

Since, Miekal, I know you have web access (& Joel, you no doubt do as well),
you can read at least one section from _culture_, "An Account," at:

http://www.system-zero.com/cyanosis/Text/poetics/anaccount.html

I'd be happy, Miekal, to mail you a copy of "Product," the first section of
_culture_, which my wife & I published in 1990 or 1991. Back-channel me your
address.

Joel, I have to go administer language exams most of the day today, & only have
e-mail at work, but if no one else has posted a bibliography by Monday, I'll do
that then. As far as _Absence Sensorium_, Dan & Tom's collaborative poem, it
was published by Potes & Poets Press:

http://writing.upenn.edu/epc/presses/ganick/potes.html

I think I paid $14 for it--not sure if you have to add postage to that or not.

Thanks, Carolyn, for reminding me that bp nichol, too, was 44--& to everyone
else who reminded me O'Hara was (wow) younger. No coincidence: I opened my
e-mail program up this morning . . . to exactly 44 messages. What do you say,
think, when things like this happen? Unbelievable.

Yours,

harold, i was talking about historical context and ongoing inequities, not
specific cases.  of course men suffer socially and economically when they
take on traditionally "feminized" roles. that fact, to me, underscores my
point that we live in a sexist society.  sure, individual women take their
husbands' names for any number of reasons: they sound better; carrying
their father's name, with which they're saddled  at birth, is no less
sexist; it's more convenient for childrearing and record-keeping, etc.  All
of these except the first (aesthetics) to me underscore the fact that we
live in a sexist society.  the passion of your post, and the unusualness of
the choices you've made, to me underscore the fact that we live in a sexist
society that makes such choices remarkable.  my hat's off to you for the
choices you have made.  i wasn't, though, talking about individual
volition; i was responding to what i felt was a glib suggestion that women
"taking" their husband's names was equivalent to men "taking" their wives
as possessions; can't remember who made that post now.  bests, maria d

i believe that in one of the chinese languages, the word "four" is a
synonym for   "death," and thus is often avoided.  if doubled, that wd seem
to suggest an untimely or otherwise noteworthy-for-its-tragicness death.

funny you shd mention this, bill; but it reminds me of something that
resonates w/ the other list-thread on the honesty or not of critics.  one
thought i always bring to books when i review them is, "was this book worth
cutting down trees for?"  of course the answer is almost always negative
but of course i don't feel i can say that in a review, it sounds way too
harsh.  but often i think that way:  if this is an assistant professor
coming up for tenure, and needs to publish, is it worth the trees?  if this
book is by a dean or tenured full prof whose future is not at issue, is it
worth the trees?  you'll notice that content has not yet entered the
picture.  that's because, with very few exceptions, most of the academic
manuscripts or books i'm asked to review  *really* don't add much to human
knowledge, and certainly don't add as much as trees do to the quality of
human life. so, i'm expecting excoriating messages back from all and
sundry, accusing me of utter corruption.  so ask yourself: is *your* book
worth the trees?  most of us have such small print runs it's okay (yes, i
think about that too), esp the chapbooks etc., and those show such a
spirited do-it-yrself energy that i think they're definitely worth it; i'm
talking mostly about the academic book industry.

r u kidding? i think many folks on the list find your persistence and

Bill,

Thanks for your response. Having only resubscribed to the Poetics list this
past week I was afraid my post--a response to the discussion of Ron's
perceived lack of a "crystallization" among younger writers--was lost to
ears no longer tuned in to the topic. (I had been following the discussion
on the archives.) I took a week just to think about it. It's been discussed
on a smaller list and, having bounced ideas around with Steve Evans and
Douglas Rothschild over the weekend, I only wrote the "PAX" poem-- half
satire--on Thursday night.

I should like to address your comments by connecting them with certain
statements of Ron's in the PHILLY TALKS. The poignancy of his thought (one I
don't think Jeff Derksen responds to adequately, although he does cover
other areas with adroitness) is caught when he questions what it means to be
writing in today's world--after 1979 I think is the date; in a world where
Palestinians suffer oppression but are only portrayed in American mainstream
press as terrorists, or where the genocide going on in East Timor isn't
portrayed at all. (I don't have the TALKS before; I'm sorry if not getting
this 100%.) Those were two examples that Ron used. The environment is
certainly another; one certainly not restricted by national borders. I think
if there were to be a "crystallization" among younger writers (and I'm not
advocating one) it would be centered such social questions of writing. Or,
if I were to advocate a "crystallization" that's the one I would choose.

You've got to understand: when poets are aware of things like this (if I
anticipated any poet would be it would be Ron Silliman) I am fairly excited,
but when poets actually speak of them, in public, in the context of writing;
well, it gives me quite a rush. Why? Because many of the poets I love (in
the 20th century anyway) are concerned with such things in their poems. Form
is an afterthought for me. I'm not being as explicit as possible about this
(probably making myself out to be a agenda-packing poet seeking to fancy up
a message to an arts crowd) but this will have to do here, and as I don't
yet have a book published I cannot refer you to my poems.

The agrarian metaphor in "PAX" (or aboreal even) stems from the poem's
model, Ezra Pound's "Pact" found in PERSONAE. The metaphor, like a lineage
of poetics, runs through the century from Williams, Duncan ("open fields"),
to the "Tree" anthology--well, I'm not saying anything people on this list
don't already know but I think the "nursing new roots" image in the end is
where I stand on this.

The invitation to "mutual comradeship" stands.

By the way, where is Ron? I hope your cold is gone.

Harold's fretfully defensive post is interesting.  Yeah, in fact I don't
think there's much question but that a woman's surrender of her name is
preposterous and grotesque.  But it's a basic political point, Harold, not
(at least as far as I'm concerned) an ad feminam attack on any given
individual.  Capitalism sucks too, but I'm enmeshed in it by having to
work for a wage, by watching its television, buying its books.  That's not
a moral failure, it's an ongoing social dynamic.  (Yes I know I know
someone's going to pipe up to suggest archly or otherwise that it *is* a
moral failure!  you can find someone to defend--or attack--anything on
this list!)

Even more to the point I suggest you consider disavowing marriage itself.
Cast out the great satans of church and state.  Erika and I have been
together for 16 years and very happy indeed without their benefits!

I've written to Gary Sullivan.

All I'll say here is that I meant my words (wish he was here so I cd
throttle him for what he did) to express my longing for his presence and my

"in French it's of course "ma femme" =97
the translation I use is Antin's which says "my woman" -- but there
exists another more recent one that tries to p.c.fy (I guess, or else
legalize the free union) the poem by translating "ma femme" as "my
wife." Does that make any difference?"

The American English phrase "my woman" is simply *not* a translation of the
French "ma femme". In French, that phrase *means* (denotes, points at,
identifies) "my wife." Just as "ma femme de menage" *means* my maid and not
"my woman-who-orders-household."

The phrase "my woman" is full of romantic (literarily, I mean) overtones
and symbolic connections (to "woman"), and universalisms (viz. a man and a
woman). Using it in the translation skews the poem.=20

Breton is *investing* the quotidian relationship -- husband and wife --
with qualities foreign to it or transformative of it, and investing the
*object* he views from within that matched-pair relationship with mystical
qualities. Using "my woman" to translate "ma femme" removes the point of
the poem entirely. The result -- to me -- is utterly leaden. Whereas in
French I liked it a lot.

I highlight the word *object* because obviously the poem *objectifies* his
wife. Ooooh, the shame of it. And, if I've effectively (however lightly)
skimmed responses to it here, this fact has not gone unnoticed, as many a
better-knowing head has nodded.

One of Tom's Ten Ways To Let The Fly Out Of The Bottle (available to grad
students at a nominal cost) is this: *all* sex and all sexual relationships
involve objectification. More sex implies more objectification. Or, as
Breton might have said on one occasion or another: "amusez-vous bien."

never had sexual relations with that woman (in case Kenneth Starr is on the

 Fascinating posts! Louis, Joshua, Chris

1. That male-hero poet is often actually a family unit in which the
woman is a key but silent figure - rarely a writer herself - who makes the
world being spoken out of -

2. It is an interesting characterization - that edge of community idea
-
It suggests a Janus-like facing both ways - perhaps a multiple betrayal -
which seems potentially very productive - Perhaps the  more totally one is
compromised but committed (the relentlessly feminist male poet, the
male-identified female poet, the Oxford-educated Indian poet etc) the more
interesting and mutiply legible the writing would be -

3. As one who might be regarded as anti-academic or anti-theory, I would
like to say emphatically that I am not - I simply think that in the
interface between those two communites sometimes the poet who
writes academic essays (or who specifically addresses that community) is
valued for that reason more than others who do not - so that such writing (not only critical, but critical within
a certain format) becomes part of the poet job description - Which in
itself is not bad, but leads to visibility issues -

4. Who are your imagined (actual) readers?

Dan's attitude toward the sister & brotherhood of poets could be usefully
contrasted with my own.  A political awareness & a political poetics
could, I imagine, be just as clearly articulated by a loner writing for
everybody as by a buddy writing within a movement.  I've been trying to
argue that there's a problem with the buddy system: uncritical
promotion.  How do you deal with that, Dan?  How do you deal with the
HISTORICAL & POLITICAL PROBLEM of juntas - generational, tribal,
factional, ideological - which to me seem so much "part of the problem"?

I am fully aware of the energy that builds among people sharing the
details of what they're doing, going over it, reading together, getting
into the complexity, teaching, talking about what's happening.  I am
fully aware of the vulnerability - the basic amateurism - of all the
lonely poetasters out there, yearning for the food of the mind.
Still.  I hate groups using the echolalia technique of self-praise;
I hate the self-justifications, magnifications, of groups. [They get
in the way of my own.] How do YOU deal with this issue?

Give me the stolen air of solitude & uncorrectness.

It's quite a laugh to see defensive postions played out so unjustly on this
list.  I'm sure I could take anyone's words out of context also, and apply
them to malignant ends to support my own positions.  But I don't because it's
unfair and pathetic.  No one here has ever said or done something they
regret?  Who has unguarded moments of weakness?  Who never gives in to a
desire to 'act out' in social situations to make a point, to reveal humor,
or yeah, even to piss someone off?  Are there no pattern recognigitons in
human character?  Public language?

We are no longer discussing poetics, but opposing dissent within a community
with the kinds of responses that actually validate many of the social
perceptions acknowledged in both 'Stalinist as Linguist' essays.  Further
more, these attempts to degrade someone in absentia is like beating a kitten
in a sack.  At least those articles appeared within the community Clark was
a part of.  The problem is not so much with him now, but with the fact that
anyone dares challenge this 'community' in any way outside of 'polite'
discourse.  The most lame, thoughtless opinions imaginable are perfectly
accepted as long as they don't rub against the communal grain.  But
dissenting opinions are challenged with ruthless rhetorical twists.

Henry Gould has been much more articulate and generous than myself re:
issues of poetic value.  What he suggests, however, is science fiction because,
as you can tell from this list, the reality of our poetics is business and
politics, the kind that some here cherish more than the poetry Henry obviously
loves.

I was drawn back onto this list (feeling myself, whether I like it or not, to
be a part, in some way, of this community) because Bromige made certain
disparaging remarks about Tom Clark.  I said what I had to say about Watten
et al.  He and others responded in turn about Clark.  I did not agree
entirely with those responses, nor did Bromige et al with mine.  Now
suddenly, the scale has escalated and nothing is based on a 'generou' or
'reasonable' exchange of opinion, but on decontextualized 'snips' from one
man's life.  I've said it before and I'll say it now.  The heart of the
issue is that this community refuses dissent from within or without.  If it
does not reek of precious Derrida it's in bad odor.  If someone challenges our
poetic assumptions they are disposed of in ways that are measured by the
'politeness' of the opposing opinions.

Maybe it's the electronic medium that forces us to be so reductive.  Maybe
it's just greed and a desire to measure our precious *intelligence* and
self-righteousness against others.  Who the fuck knows.  But I'm posting
this now before I say something I don't wanna say.  Besides.  I've gotta go
chase 'nymphomaniacs' on my computer screen.  That's obviously more *fun*
than hanging out here all day.  Dale

On the surname question: In Latin America and Spain (probably other
places) a wife adopts the name of her husband ("de" so and so--de
meaning "of") _but_ also keeps in active use her own name, which in
turn is passed down to her children. All people, then, carry the
names of both parents. Unfortunately, this more "liberated"practice
seems to have had little effect on a decidedly patriarchal and
machista tradition.

I say, we've had a bit of a term break here in ivy-spivied old Left Overbie,
so wouldn't you know I've been perusing your "poetics" list rawther more
diligently, a pot of the old kishkim near at hand in my beloved librurry...

I say, there has been quite a tussling and jostling of elbows round this
bit about - whatchymicallit, "Indie-Criticism" - quite a baffling &
buffeting, soreheads & all... & it did occur to me to wonder what the Bard,
dear o' Shakespeare, would think of all this... rawther a solid poet there,
I should say - though Ben Jonson wrote "would he had blotted a thousand
[lines]" - now was that independent of you, Ben?  Rawther a spot jealous,
no doubt - My "good buddy" [heh heh] Ben Carrelis down Aussie way back-
channeled to say "Anybody who trumpets so loud & often on that d--d list
as Mr. Gould can't be anything but a GODAWFUL poet" - but I say, I won't get
into any odd hummingem hereabouts...

Anyhow, what about Shakespeare?  Well I pulled down my folio completus
& what did I find?  The plays are chock full of what you call "Fools for
Love".  Whether it's Antonio in MERCHANT throwing his fortune away for
love of his "buddy" Sebastian, or Marc Antony tossing off the Empire for
sweepie Cleopat, why, these types are EVERYWHERE!!!  So I think we might
assume the Bard would say : why, we're all fools for love - love of poetry,
love of our pals, love of our foreberries, love of glory - & the one who
sets himself up as the cool objective cucumber must be... THE BIGGEST FOOL
OF ALL!  - and, if I might paraphrase you dashed Yanks - "that's no bull!"

Oh I say Henry, don't cry... there there... that's a good little indie-boy...
Remember, it's almost Valentine's Day - now there was a fool if ever...

Now I remember that patronymics as we know them, even in parts of western
Europe, are fairly recent. Norwegians (and other Scandinavians?) had no
family names until required for the convenience of census-taker and taxman
in the mid nineteenth century. When told to choose a last name most males
(they got to choose) opted for the name they'd always been called by, so
there are a lot of John son of Johns (Jansen, Jonson, etc., depending on
country) in the Oslo phone book.
Icelanders still do it the old-fashioned way--everybody is somebody's son
or dottir, and last names change with each generation.

When did Smith become a last name instead of a career-choice?

Incidentally, my wife and I each legally retain our own last names. This
was fine with the powers that are in Las Vegas, where we tied the
knot--didn't even raise an eyebrow at the record clerk's. I don't know what
the current law is in other states, but I knew a couple back in the sixties
la femme of which had to change her name legally back to what it had been
before marriage. I think that was in Maryland.

glad you're back / i too have Silliman's Philly Steak right next to me and
plan to get to it as soon as i'm done here / but to a couple of your points

i think i agree here / are "such social questions of writing" also social
questions of living, and living questions of...? / seriously, the
"crystallization" that has probably itself gotten too much press here
would, will, might center on the articulation of these questions, as well
as the articulation of the activities (writing, living, arguing,
challenging) to which the questions refer / so we have to be direct / and
to my mind, addressing below, questions of form, practice, social
awareness, political struggle, global survival, can inform each other / as
thoughts as well as afterthoughts / an integrated approach seems necessary
/ i'm being vague too, but put the question: what are the "social questions
of writing"?

i understand the "rush" you're talking about / it's the rush i get when a
good poet says anything in public, given that the voices with which the
public speaking world is saturated are rarely those of poets / Ron S is
often a wake-up call, when he addresses the issues like the ones you
mention / when the "talk" turns to address possible generational
disparities and shortcomings, the effect might not be so thrilling, as some
here have suggested / maybe a 'turning against' when some folks think
greater solidarity is in order? / again, i have to read the thing

okay, and i think here's where some of the nursing gets done / i liked your

together with "Wortell and Wallman" [genders unknown]) backed by a studio
orchestra conducted by Victor Young and containing among others Tommy
Dorsey and Eddie Lang, on 2/23/32 :

"my woman, is mean as she can be

"my woman, she has a heart of stone

         Reply to:   RE: my man (for Gwyn McVay)
A lovely song for which many a queer man still gets teary-eyed. I wonder =
if those boys who wrote it were queer? In that case, the female singer =
becomes the wonderful beard through which these sentiments can be =
expressed. And there's certainly an altogether different conotation of "my =
man" when it's uttered by another man, mais non?

As for Bessie Smith, Ma Rainey and many other early blues singers, their =
male muses were often "bulldaggers" (the term of the day) or butch girls. =
This gives the possessive "my" a much different function, akin to when you =
order eggs benedict in a restaurant and you get something with cheese =
sauce instead of hollandaise. The waiter then tells you, "this is our eggs =
benedict" meaning "our version of." Oh my man I do love him so, whatever =
gender he happens to be...

Shanghainese, Min-nan hua & Northern Mandarin) "4" is a homophone for
death, but the heavy taboo avoidance unlucky aura is strongest among the
Cantonese.  But 4 is not always unlucky in Chinese, viz the Buddha's 4
Noble Truths or Deng Xiaoping's 4 Cardinal Principals or Zhou Enlai's 4
modernizations.

A Shanghainese or Taiwanese would pronounce "44" more or less as "si si si"
(four ten four/death death death) since those dialects don't clearly
distinguish between "si" and "shi"

Repeating the 4, in some schools of fengshui, would negate it.  (To
return like a dog to my vomit, that was called "negating the negation" in
Stalinist dialectics.)

Being a lyric poet after 40 is pretty difficult, unless you're going to
be a dirty old man ala Yeats.

According to Confucius, "at 40 I was no longer confused"

(15 I became intent on study, 30 I was established, 40 no longer
confused, 50 knew the will of heaven, 60 obeyed the will of heaven, at 70
I could do whatever I wanted because my desires no longer were
inappropriate -- Analects II.4)

good, interesting way really, though i could never call it 'ethical' or

    A distinction should be made between the Idea of the University and the
University as an administrative and regulatory unit. The Idea is one of the
bravest and most beautiful we have: a universe of knowledge, a repository of
what humans have learned, and a place to advance that knowledge.

    I agree certainly that Derrida represents some of  the best of what that
ideal has been able to produce in recent years.  His writing is "powerful,
precise, and stunning," an epic effort to recooperate a cultural tradition
that has run away with itself and left much of the best of what humans have
left seeming quite irrelevant.  That he is touched upon in a Woody Allen movie
is hardly negative.  In fact, it proves that he is actually producing an
effect.  And  there are other great academics--Deleuze  should be mentioned.

    And it has been little noticed, the academic wheels move so slowly, that
Derrida has moved beyond deconstruction to a new constructivism (_On the
Name_, for example, is constructivist in much the sense that term was used in
both the art and in formal logic in the early part of this century.  I do not
have the book at hand, but it ends saying, we must "construct a logos that
look like a living creature," or something of that sort.  It is an attempt to
recover the Plato of _Timaeus_, among the most mythological and mystical of
Plato's writings.  If you want to talk academic work, this is what it is
really about.

   This turn should not be a surprise to to any one.  There are very positive
mentions of Plotinus and Neoplatonism  (and _On the Name_ is classic
Neoplatonic move) as early as _Speech and Phenomena_,  but academics,
especially American academics, saw in deconstruction nothing but away to avoid
all but the narrowest kind of longing subject in ruthless social context.

    Moreover, no one noticed that all of this might have something to do with
a Neoplatonism that was resurgent in 1) the Eliot's interest in metaphysical
poetry (and, thus, the whole of New Criticism); 2) Pound's interest in
Gemisto's and Ficino's centrality to the Italian renaissance; 3) the
Blake-Yeats tradition of vision; or 4) Olson's anti-metaphysical stance in
"Human Universe" and his redevelopment of constructivism (in a very precise
sense) through the mathematical philosophy of Herman Weyl and others. It also
should have been  apparent, from the moment that Derrida appeared as a figure
working through the interstrices of the post May 68 and the malaise of the
Heideggerian philosophy was that he beginning to arrive what had been many of
the central themes of American philosophy and poetry since William James.

    Without any disrespect for Derrida, I would suggest that the Derrida
phenomena in the America university is an extraordinary example of the way in
which the institution contrives through the most arcane and bureaucratic of
its structures to function as a regulatory force in the culture. It is not
because of demonic plot or vicious administrators; most everyone is doing what
they do with the best of motives and the worst of results. I have worked in
universities since 1971, but I had no idea how minutely the administrative
structure of the university controls what is, in sum, purveyed as knowledge
before the last three years, when I have served as Director of Graduate
Studies.  It is a remarkable system which gives everyone the experience of
freedom and largely manages to cancel out that freedom.  It must the
understood that the university is inherently the most conservative institution
in the culture: its sole purpose is to take the accumulated knowledge and pass
it on to the next generation.  It works very well in stable times, and it
thrives (though it does not work well) in times that can imagine themselves to
be stable (e.g. the 50s), but it is utterly incapable of dealing with profound
and rapid change--those times when some threshold is crossed, e.g. now.

Dear Gary Sullivan,

In June, 1991 Daniel Davidson sent me a copy of his strikingly excellent
book of prose poems "Product" with a brief note containing some kind words
about my own work. He sent the book and the note partly in response to
Cydney Chadwick having mentioned to him how much I admired a piece called
"Transit" which was published in Avec. I admired and enjoyed "Product"
immensely and put it in an easy to reach place, and read it often. When I
learned of Davidson's suicide I was very saddened, a feeling poignantly
sharpened by the publication, soon after, of his masterful poetic
collaboration with Tom Mandel titled "Absence Sensorium" (Potes and Poets
Press, 1997). No doubt Tom Mandel has been deeply affected, as have many
others. This project to get something together about his work would be an
opportunity as well,of course, for everyone to learn more about Davidson
and his powerful writing, which included an issue of A.bacus (#95) ("from
Culture"), and the magisterial "Image", a Zasterle Book (1992) with the
resonantly atmospheric kind of cover art and book design so often
associated with that remarkable press in the Canary Islands, also
responsible for Allen Ginsberg's mysterious final book, "Luminous Dreams"
(1997), as well as as Tom Mandel's "Ancestral Cave(1997):"intimate
conversation only slightly removed/ from silence, a remove to the
distance/of barbarian chatter, the/candles sputter, the world outside/the
window dies." I hope you have the opportunity to follow through on this
project, one that I will gladly support any way I can.

Very best wishes,
Nick Piombino

why not ask that question of books? -- no excoriating responses here / this
is one of the reasons i adore chapbooks, and small press runs, and the
"made-to-order" policy of some micropresses -- seems like such an efficient
use of resources (in most cases, not all) -- not to mention the aesthetics
and practicality of the chapbook mode: ease of portability, speed of
production, light weight (fits well in the backpack or back pocket, etc.),
reading in one sitting (generally) / a friend of mine starting a magazine
mentioned that he'd decided to find more money and go upscale for fear that
readers would treat the lowscale production as a disposable item -- i was
disheartened by this, treasuring perhaps more than my perfect-bounds the
chaps and *little* books coming from presses extinct and extant: i think of
them as something like notations of a more current practice, a little more
fresh and alive sometimes than the slicker flat-spines (staple-lovers
unite?) / i'm trying to get a small chapbook series off the ground and hope
to tap into some of these values -- using all tools and materials as
efficiently as possible in a small way similar to the way native americans
used the whole buffalo, hide to marrow / waste and inefficient use of
resources analogous to the practices of factory farms (recycling cow parts
into cow feed doesn't cut it for me) is again another thing that motivates
on several fronts, poetic and otherwise / as for trees (it's all related,
all of it) we save a lot of paper here on Poetics, and e-mags obviously
offer an attractive alternative, plus personal web publishing, etc. / i
wonder though if anyone has calculated the resource-draw of all this
personal computer use (silicon, plastics, electricity, phone lines,
capital, etc.) / what uses more resources, for example: a 1/2 ounce letter
posted in the mail, or a 5 Kb file posted to Poetics? (all things
considered) / i'd assume the former, but i ain't sure

all best,
bill

I second Maria's "bravo" regarding Josh Shuster's post--that post
helpfully focused the thread on community not careerism. Of course,
"careerism" is a peculiarly awful academic disease, and I am sure that
its various manifestations and self-serving politics grate on the nerves
of those both inside and outside the academy. BUT I cannot accept
disaffection with the academy as a rationale for bashing what little
intellectual and affective life there is among those who claim to be
poets--whatever the community to which they claim allegiance.

I want to talk about that "affective" life in so far as it is able to
manifest itself electronically. It seems to me that we censor one
another dreadfully--projects, rallying cries, and bashing aside. It
seems to me that no one posts without a degree of prudence or grain of
salt concerning reception. If I were to offer a project for a cyber
community--it would be to to create a space where there was less harping
on and anticipation of resistance. There very impossibility of doing
what I propose (intrinsic as that impossibility is to the construction
of power/knowledge loops) probably speaks more to the death of my own
soul and to my fascination with the destructive processes I see at work
here than it does my desire to express myself freely. Maybe only to the
extent that desire to express oneself (an illusory right nourished by
mother's milk, apple pie, and media exposure) is subject to mangling and
frustration do any of us even attempt to write--so lets tread lightly on
that ground even as we map the terrain.

We travel to Beppu where we make a big storm and a tsunami fills all
the onsen with frothy-fish-foam and someone makes an island.

iii

There are trees on the island, there's a dragon and a cave made of
burning human skin, the skin grows from the outside in, it's like a
yakitoriya there, all warm and would-be pretty good to eat, but the
dragon likes the roof, her flame goes out in the rain, you can only
imagine the rest of this, how we burrowed and made little rooms for
ourselves, ringing our begging-bowls, playing shakuhachi, until she
gave up, in, out, 10,000 yen for the troubles, and how they emerged
in Ireland.

We leave the island, heading for a place that makes crows constantly.

In this place, there's a parliament of birds deciding on a proper
constitution. So it includes homage to the emperor, a clean death for
all traitors, exchange students and retributions well-crafted for
certain crimes and misdemeanors, take care of the shrine! which means
liquid for everyone, you might think someone would care in the midst
of all this chaos. But now there's a text and everyone can read, and
happily everyone does the production, even criminals who gladly
retribute. Now we collect money from the criminals, because we rebuild
the onsen, that's so necessary. It's quite nice now and not very
expensive, and a writer like me can disgorge, unravel, open up like a
box of shogi pieces which can't play the game of Japan. I will sit
down at my desk with my brush. I will ink the inkan and ink the
computer. I will portray my whole life, mendicant, auspicious,
medieval. You will not believe the lovely jewels, curved, bitten in
three places, tongues torn from mouths, just lovely talk. There's no
mouth (against which the tongues) pressed against the skin against the
dragon cave. The skin against the cave was comfortable, warm, worn;
the cave wore the skin.

The skin against the cave was the cave, the game of Japan.

in which I am a magatama jewel. Now you will bite me in three places,
what I call "the game of Japan."

viii

The apology for all peoples, which I make, a life of regret. That I am
not all peoples, that I am on the exterior of any skin for any house
containing any plant or animal. I am called a "covering." A "covering"
may be a surface with thickness, and may serve the purpose of rainful-
keeping-away. Together we meet again and shake hands and smile and the
sun is warm (we have made it that way). And we are mendicant monks; we
are wandering. We're on the road of total dissolution. There's a
stream hampered by something or other, and we've got these jewels.

Dear Tom,

 I tend to agree with the bottom half of your response (that’s where the sex
and the objectification is) but I believe that in the top half (that’s where
the words are) you are a bit too trenchant in your decisions re French.
    “Femme” is “woman.” The possessive pronoun “ma” can turn it indeed all too
easily into “my wife.” But it does not do so necessarily. Thus,  “ma femme”
is,  literally and in _most_ other senses, “my woman.” “My wife” is “mon
épouse.” Of course “ma femme” is often, even mainly in everyday speech *also*
used to refer to “the wife,” the way the brits say “the missis.”  But “femme”
in French also always retains exactly what you say of the English word, which
“always is at bottom “woman,” and “full of romantic (literarily, I mean)
overtones and symbolic connections (to "woman"), and universalisms (viz. a man
and a woman). Using it in the translation skews the poem.”

  The favorite sport of the surrealists was “chercher la femme,” and that
didn’t mean they were looking for their spouses -- the latter a happily nearly
unused term these days. What we in fact have is, as so often, the case of an
English that’s richer than the French, and in this case, has three terms,
woman/ wife/ spouse instead of the French doublet femme/épouse — with femme
having to carry the load of both woman and wife. And the word does carry it.
Which is why you are right — if you want to read, as you do, the poem
primarily as Breton  “*investing* the quotidian relationship -- husband and
wife --with qualities foreign to it or transformative of it.” But that’s a
very limited reading, whatever the legal relationship Breton had with the
specific woman (if there is one) he is addressing with/in the poem . (And we
know, see below, that he was not addressing his wife.) Anybody French coming
to the poem will first hear “woman” — and “woman” in exactly that sense that a
blues singer will say “my woman” and maybe later, at a 2nd, 3rd or 10th
reading, could think of the “wife” qua  legal spouse — but  legal niceties
are not really on the front burner in a poem titled FREE UNION. Therefore
translating it as “my woman” may miss a little of the complexity, but
translating it as “my wife” misses most of the richness of the address and
limits it to one  small facet.

 And one facet that Breton did *not* intend. The date of composition of the
poem is 20 & 21 May 1931.  Breton had by then been definitely separated from
his first wife for a number of months, was thus unmarried, footlose and
“cherchait la femme,” and was in fact alone that month after a number of brief
liasons.  And he had not yet met the woman who would become his second wife,
Jacqueline Lamba, to whom he would write in a letter dated 4/10/39: “greet the
beautiful landscape [of Lyons-la-Forét where she was] which after all inspired
me to write ‘Free Union’ for you whom I didn’t even know then.”  Of course he
kept on to "chercher la femme," and on the copy of his volume _Poèmes_ which
he offered to his next (3rd & last) wife Elisa in 1948, Breton wrote as
dedication:”’My wife with hair...’ / so it was you / my love / so true I
didn’t back then / give it a face / though it was in early 1931/ that  you
came to France  / for the first time.” Breton certainly addressed the poem to
“l’éternel féminin,” and not to the /a /  one or the other / spouse.

Final verification: I just read the French poem to mi compañera who happens to
be the genuine article, ie native French, & asked her who she would translate
it into English — "lady" was what she said immediately  (and Paul Blackburn
may well have used that term, had he translated the poem) but  rejected "wife"
out of hand.

 PS. In an early ms. of the poem, he compares “his” woman’s breasts to “la
beurrée verte,” —  a strange cocktail consisting of 1/4 absinthe, 1/4 gin, 1/4
beer and 1/4 basic eau-de-vie. He dropped that image in the final version.

it seems to me joshua (& louis) have raised some key issues with regard =
to thinking politics & its relation to culture.  if, as louis suggested, =
community is an imaginary construct, perhaps it is also, importantly, a =
political construct.  that is, i think of this list is in a sense, a new =
kind of community, a community with a range of new possibilities (a =
literary community that allows easy exchange inside/outside the =
academies, over national borders?).=20

politically, a thinking of community needs to be fluid.  as louis =
suggested, poetry is always written from within a community, it has to =
be - & this literary community it comes from extends not only through =
space but through time.

following derrida, the writing of jean-luc nancy on community offers =
some interesting insights on contemporary concepts of community.  =
briefly, nancy suggests (out of bataille & blanchot) community as a =
process that allows the possibility of constructing particular, specific =
subjectivities.  more precisely for a literary community, a community =
that is articulated when the limits of language/knowledge/subjectivity =
are reached, a kind of exposure that unworks any simple transfer of =
meaning.

nancy, bataille and blanchot (in "the unworkable community") think =
community not as a abstract formal category, but as an operation, a =
process on the material plane, a passing-between at the fluid borders =
between singularities.  i use the term singularities rather than subject =
because it allows several (an infinite?) number of singularities within =
a subject.  its a little philosophical (sorry) but a way of thinking =
beyond the "outcasted male/female individual hero" character.  perhaps =
also deleuze & guattari's notion of the book as an assemblage - with the =
"author" merely one point in the convergence of variously formed =
matters, different dates & speeds ...

Maria, thanks for a wise and measured reply to my passionate post.

Yes, it is true, we live in a sexist society. As far as historical context
and ongoing inequities goes, it's all a mess, and I guess I was trying to
say that all this stuff does come down to specific cases, so we all have to
be careful how we describe things.

Best,

I haven't been able to closely follow the list of late, but after
going through some of the posts on the "My Woman" thread, I feel
like I might have something wrong with me, both personally and
politically, for I've always found Breton's poem to be absolutely
fantastic, a strange, disturbing, funny, mesmerizing, joyful,
life-affirming, truly erotic poem. It never occured to
me that there was something "wrong" with it. Desnos always does more
for me, but Breton's poem is one I would have liked to have written,
that's for sure. I guess that might sound "unfeminist" of me, but I
don't know how else to say it. What, really, is so anachronistic or
objectionable about the body of the beloved as, yes, _object of
desire_, the body of the beloved as ecstatic "occasion" for unbounded
and lustful praise? Any way you cut it, there's a certain
objectifying drift to the erotic. And insofar as the charged
polarities of eroticism lay the bed for the incandescence of
union and climax, couldn't we agree that erotic objectification
is, ipso facto, more natural than cultural--"objectionable" only in
the sense that eating meat is objectionable? (One can _choose_ not to
eat meat, but the human drive to eat the flesh of other beings is not
going to go away.)

One can be "proper" in the sense of sexual politics, and those
politics are surely important; but it's good to always keep in mind
that the great thing about sexual passion, when it's good, is that it
throws propriety out the window. And Breton's poem is, in the first
instance, a poem of unjambed sexual passion. (Which, as I partly
read it, says both that he wants to do her and that she does _him_,
that she ultimately makes shreds of his drive to "own" or "control"
her in the social sense of those terms.) Why not admire
the paean for what it most deeply is:  a wild loosing of unconscious,
sexual desire, that most profound and unbidden force from which life
and language spring. Heaven forbid that poetry become a tool to
regulate the flow of that force by means of the qualifications of
"correctness".

["Heaven forbid that the body of the other (pulsing
quasar--primordial black hole) be shorn from me, cease being
impossibly far yet still sensed, sending callings of its fathomless
death through billions of years, emitting reason-collapsing surprise
to the one who lusts, who listens there entranced, entranced for
there's nothing she can do about it, that's just the way the universe
is my swelling sex, the beloved as event horizon from whose sucking
edge nothing in language escapes."  --Margarita Risoldo, Cuban
soap-opera star, thanking Bill Clinton for a signed copy of
Leaves of Grass]

It was grossly incorrect to be sure, but probably not for nothing
that Stephen Hawking (who said yes) bet another physicist (who said
no) a year's subscription to Penthouse over whether a black hole
could come to a singularity of infinite density and pop clear
out of space and time. Whoever lost the bet got the Penthouse as
consolation. Hawking won, proving, perhaps, that even the weirdest
puzzles and mysteries of the universe are never fully free from the
groin.

  Though I am interested In Linda Russo's (and others) endeavour to
  combine the "feminism" thread with Rob Hale's original seduction
  valentine's day query (and now that I think about it; I think I was
  the one who first made this connection by bringing up the idea of
  how Free Union's "sexism" may depend on the reader), I want to
  again open up the question (which may have gotten a little lost
  in the shuffle) of writing as seduction in "amorous" contexts.....

  If one writes a love poem, an epideictic praise poem
  (like, say, Elvis Costello's: "I can tell you that I like your
   sensitivity, but you know it's the way that you walk")
  one if often, of course, trying to persuade (forensic?)....
  Now, if poetry is beyond rhetoric, as many argue (though not in
  poetry if poetry is beyond rhetoric), the forensic or persuasive
  asepct of poetry should not be as important as the poem as a
  "self-sufficient act of mind," an aesthetic object whose SUCCESS
  should not be measured by the degree to which one has actually
  persuaded the lover of the "troth" of one's love, has reassured
  the lover, but by some other standard (and this can lead one to
  POLITICAL analysis of love poems, the poem is "not really about
  love" , not really about the person to whom it pretends to be
  addressed, may be really about politics [like all those blues songs
  by black men can really be about how white america doesn't requite
  their love as a subtext], that the poet is in love with love and that
  this, in a non-medieval age of non-troubador, non-minnesingers, is of
  course BAD: "you can't have sex with a muse" they say).....
  but if we try to take such love poems in face value,
  whether they are praise poems, complaint poems, etc....
  one does suspendpolitical questions and even aesthetic questions
  aside from "are my trousers tight enough" (again, O'Hara)
  but, as so often happens, one may write a love poem for someone (the
  person that inspires it) and either cannot send it, will not send it,
  or will find it "unsuccessful" (falling on deaf ears) and then,
  seeing that one has a reading coming up and wants to read something
  new, will read it to others, and then the "you" of that poem becomes
  a "she" (or "he"), unless someone else can have the "act of faith"
 (aka delusion) that the poem is "about" that person, and then the poem
   is "a success" (but such may seem to the poet a "hollow success"---
   DOUG CRASE has a very good essay that reads ASHBERY's "project" in
   such terms by the way).
   THE SF Hippie underground folks, the diggers I think (unless it was
   the motherfuckers) said "to love is to fail"...
   and I still think it's important to clear a space for poems (AND
   poets) who, let's say may be a little shy and introverted, and feel
   maybe a little uncomfortable around people in "normal" situations
   and who maybe decide to use writing as "a sophisticated form of
   personal ad", as a kind of "compensation", or even as an attempt
   to find a soulmate, a double, in ways that "social life" and the
   spontaneous exigencies of wit and the marketplace and parties do
   not allow (at least for some of us, not all of us), or even, dare
   i say it, a "higher" way that may make it obvious that the writer
   of the poem is somehow DIFFERENT from one's Tarzan and Trump and that
   that difference, despite what the "world" says, is not always
   crippling--and that it means the writer is interested in more than
   the attributes of the body of the beloved and wants to be loved for
   more than that as well....Well, I'll stop here. gotta run to teach
   yet another class (adjunct salary toothless benefits!). Chris

I also enjoyed Dan's poem as independently as the three of us could.  I think
politics is in the air (always), inescapable, and is actually made by people
who make difficult decisions, usually involving renunciation, in order to
"go public" or get involved.  Such decisions then become part of the
atmosphere WITHIN the poem and add to its depth.  Anyway, this is just one
angle on a many-sided phenomenon.
  What I wanted to say was it seems important that Dan framed his "transition"
via Pound's transition out of Whitman.  But in political terms I think one
might just as well stay with Whitman and the Gilded Age and the Populist
movement of a hundred years ago, the milieu Whitman was saying farewell to.
The underlying theme of gardening and the earth speaks to that earlier
(pre-Pound) tradition as much as or more than to the Pound & post-Pound
era.
  As I see it, in a global economy where Brazilians & Indonesians are forced
out of work & off-land by the millions; where small American farmers are
becoming a thing of the past; where "government" as we knew it (based on
civic involvement) is fading - the struggle is really between the common good
and Mammon.  This is a simplistic (populist) view, but I think the idea of
a populist solidarity of consciousness regarding re-establishing local/state/
national government responsibilities regarding land, access to skills, access
to housing, and other basic necessities of civil society is more fruitful than
either sub-governmental identity politics or euro-style socialism.  Post-beat,
post-New York, post-langpo poetry might just as well go back to Whitman and
start fresh.
  Plus we have peazles for everybody.  C'mon along!  - Henry Gould

p.s. I hope Dale Smith will hang around.  & I scorn with utter scorn you
scolders out there who whenever somebody gets into something negative -
criticism for the academy, questioning a poetics, challenging the networks -
you have to chime in with your scolding and cheerleading, i.e. "yeah, let's
talk about COMMUNITY..." - as if raising questions about some of the
stagnating aspects of community isn't doing just that.  Go scold yourselves.
If you don't allow criticism your communities are bolshie-fascist
consortiums of dead brain matter.

At first I thought Dale's post was supposed to be a satiric instance of the
topic indicated in the subject line.

but that delusion is hard to maintain to the end of the piece --

check out the lines about the supposed intolerance for anything that
doesn't reek of Derrida -- then, if you happen to be new to the list, look
back through the archive at some of the rather heated exchanges about
Derrida in the past -- and that's a particulalry odd charge to make in the
context (yes, there is one) of discussion about an article by Tom Clark on
Barrett watten and others --

and what's this "at least" about Clark's articles in the context of a
community he was a part of?  that need some explaining, unless the
community in question is all the book stores of the United States
Fact of the matter is that there are severe problems of logic and evidence
evident in Clark's essay, some of which have been adduced in the process of
this exchange -- and none of which have anything to do with refusal to hear
dissent --

a perception, at least here in the US, that French feminists have moved
so far into the poststructural camp as to neutralize the enactment of
any coherent political agenda. And that's because the political front of
feminism has thus far relied on - in a sort of gentlewoman's agreement -
to set aside the issue of essentialism vs. constructionism, and for the
sake of promoting specific socially progressive programs, etc. acted as
though there were no ontological rift, that something called the

Danny,"unavowable" is how I translated it, which ain't "unworkable" -- given that the French is "inavouable." That's Blanchot's term. Nancy's term (taken from Blanchot) is "désoeuvrée" -- an extremely difficult term to translate: the translator of the Nancy book used "inoperative" which it ain't either. In my intro to Blanchot's book, I tried the word "the unworking" for "désoeuvrement." (If you don't have access to the book or my intro, adn are interested, let me know & I'll post the page or so I wrote there about the difficulties of translating this word/concept on the list or backchannel. -- The word is important because it is a concept, maybe one of the
most interesting ones in Blanchot's work)

Pierre:

Your reply to Tom Mandel which just came on ("re: ma femme"-- sorry,
accidentally deleted, so not below) argues that "femme" is best read
as "woman" rather than "wife". However, looking at Antin's
translation in Poems for the Millenium, I see that the choice is
"wife," which you refer to in your reply to Tom as a "PC ified"
interpretation. Just wondering if you might be thinking of
substituting DA's version with another in future editions?

Also, I was happy to notice that Tom makes an argument
about "objectification" that is similar to mine. My only difference
with Tom here would be that "objectification" is a quality
intrinsic to the "erotic gaze" but not necessarily to the climactic
levels of sexual union, where erotic objectification, along with
everything else, more or less ceases to exist. At least when
sex is good. I still say that 'Free Union' is not a poem
about "ownership" but rather a very healthy yearning for good sex
transformed into ecstatic verse. Breton the sexist transcends his
plebeian sexism here. Hurrah for poetry.

I think Chris Stroffolino's posting says volumes, makes all kinds of sense
of the process whereby not only a *love* poem gets to be. (I hadnt heard
the diggers : "to love is to fail," before, either; something to chew on.)
I can remember the first poem I ever wrote (unfortunately), and it was a
love-lament; but I can't remember who had made me blue enough to write.

I thought Chris had written "minneswingers" but that was me reading him.

Like to applaud Kent's post re-objectification, also. (It was a good place
to remark that humans qua species are cannibal). Amorous companions
(depending upon temperament) may become further aroused by having their
parts named and appreciated--"pointed out," I suppose. The poetry-reading
is not the bedroom, though. I remember my wife (a former wife) taking
exception to a poet (here nameless) describing his penis (still attached)
floating in the bathwater: "I dont want to have to picture _that_ "

This-all started, right?, when Robert Hale reported scant success resulted
from giving that Breton poem to a romantic interest? Perhaps there's a
touch of "one-size-fits-all" about sending another man's poem to court the
woman you want to make "yours". What if she falls for Breton instead?  The
conclusion to that thought is, "write your own and give her that," but I
never did, not until it was too late, or otherwise a redundancy. During
courtship, I may have said lines from other people's poems, but I tried to
disguise them as my own, spontaneous phrases.  And in fact it was
spontaneity, recall on the instant. Anyway, I have met Robert Hale, and I
don't think he needs Breton or any of those latin lovers to help him.

George Bowering, before he married himself, used to say love-poetry to my
wife (my former wife), with what success I was never quite certain. I know
that she laughed a lot whenever his name came up. She admired his
fingernails, too, in those years romantically stained with nicotine.

Apropos of nothing in particular, I like the Breton poem quite a bit more
than the Plath poem, and nothing you can say could tear me away from my
guy, my guy.

There's a thoughtful article on Kathy Acker in the new /London Review of
Books/--oddly bedfellow'd next to an article by Helen Vendler about Amy
Clampitt--as well as a new Ashbery poem, presumably from the forthcoming
book.

Much as Don Byrd distinguishes between the Idea of the
University and the administrative, regulative, dissimulating
"freedom" given by the university that is in fact an ideology
of internalized constraints on what can be thought, done,
and dispossessed, there is a distinction, following on
Dan Huppatz's recent post, to make between individuality
("real") and singularity ("ideal"). I didn't make it in my last
post. Individuality comes from individualism which is a political
philosophy that has organized capitalism as we live it: no news there.
Anarchism was once a powerful alternative - at the First
International, over a hundred years ago, somewhere else
(Europe/England). Singularity, on the other hand, is
something elusive that can be found, sometimes, in poetry,
always, in people. I and S might sound like they're the same thing.
That's an illusion of representation. The one is not necessarily -
at all, I'd stress - founded on the other. Singularity can be found in
texts operating within different "metaphors we live by" than
the cluster of metaphors constituting everyday late capitalist
fuck that fuck you individualism (*we* are all up against the
wall screaming, or chanting, fuck that fuck you). It can be found in texts
operating even by the paradoxical metaphor of "aesthetic
tendency" or "group formation." Similarly, whatever the
opposite of singularity is - the bland, the generic? - it can be
found in the poetic texts of the most forceful individualists.
All of us are talking here, not writing poetry. What we are
talking about has got to do as much with how we live our
lives - according to what political codings - as it has to do
with issues of poetics and of texts.

On another related point, and directly contrary to some of
the views recently expressed here, I think the one
indisputable addition that "langpo" has given to "our"
understanding of the politics of poetry is exactly poetry's
*institutional* politics over the last six or so decades in the
US - and that embraces the present moment still. But the
present moment is a fleeting thing. We need to hold on to
that hardwon - it cannot be stressed enough (but I didn't
say "hardon") - political knowledge, make more of it apply
to everywhere, including to the fact Laura Moriarty indicates, that
writing poetics latches writing to agency in a way that writing per se
won't, using it to dismantle the *byt* in all our systems, as Henry in his
last postscript recognizes, whether they be the institution of the
listserve, the institution of the individual or group, or the institution
of the academy. Open the doors. Let secret histories be flagged (a
form of opening) as secret histories that can't be revealed.
        The academic politics of poetry are not the only
politics "out there." There is no reason why it should
dominate this list. To have that would be a tragedy of
myopia of enormously dumb proportions. The trees! Such a view is the
failing-block of pedagogies that assume the walls of the
classroom are the walls of the world. That space is a minute
zone danced upon by Tom's flies (fly dry, fly) forever
puzzled by McCaffery's bottle (I often do that dance and
recognize it in others). The extent of its commitment to
community is small - it is as Don says, ideally practiced by a
few (yes, individual initiative!). That applies everywhere,
though - not just in the university. After all, it's the
condition of our daily life to be separated and only joined
through the vague (bless Emerson): "I didn't know that in
objectifying social relations I was having sex with them."

Laura, you  mention the "male-identified female poet."

What does this term really mean? Anyone else have a definition?

(my attorneys). Well, Dale, let's recall you kicked off this "reasonable
discussion" by slandering me.  Your excuse--that caused you to had lost the
famous Dale Smith temper--was that I had made unsubstantiable remarks,
slurs, about Tom Clark.

I and others have done a great deal to substantiate these remarks since
then. But you learn nothing. You don't address any of our discussions. You
sit back and continue to fling doo-doo at anonymous targets. Cowardly,
wouldnt you say?

I can't imagine why you want to be on a list whose membership is trained to
identify issues and then explicate a point of view with constant reference
to that issue. All you appear capable of, is bitching and moaning.

I regret that Tom Clark is not on this list. I have written nothing about
him and his work, here--or anywhere else--that I would not say to his face.

Dale, another point : speaking of _taking_ things out of context, Aldon
Neilsen tells me that you re-print postings from this List in your
magazine, without the permission of the authors (or, presumably, the
Listmaster, who has told me that this is against the list-protocol). True,
or False?  David

Kent -- hmm, sitting here late nights with some sippin'whiskey and
posting to the list when I shld be in bed gets me muddled at times. Yes,
the version of the Breton poem in the antho is Antin's and it uses the
word "wife." It's a great version & totally likeable in exactly the way
Tom described its eroticism as functioning — and as such things happen
may have become _the_  american version. But I maintain my trasnlator's
argument: "my woman" is what Breton meant, he may, does indeed insist
that it is THE woman, the one "l'amour fou" or "Nadja" evocate, the main
squeeze, the top lady, lo que quieres, but not that legalized union
thing.

For the rest I very much agree with your take as what the poem. Yes, it
is not about ownership! There are two early versions before Breton gets
the poem right -- with varying insistence or mentioning of body parts.
Had I but the time, a learned exposé of why certain body parts are
omitted or muted or relocated or exalted differently from the first
draft to the final poem would be fun to do.

In any institution, the viciousness of the back-biting and the loudness of the

Backing-biting can be half retrieved by wit; whining can some times be converted to

Let me get this straight, Louis.  Individuality is a phantasm of capitalism.
But singularity is that elusive something (only anti-individualists can
recognize) found in every person & in poetry. Okay.  I think I got that.

Next point.  Talking about poetry gets at something that poetry can never
get at by itself - mainly, the real subtext of a piece of writing.  The poem
layers all this shimmer that poetics can see through - basically, as Laura
Moriarty put it, the Woman behind the Man.  Right?  Okay. That's criticism,
I can dig that. Critics can see more in a poem than even the poet put in there.
Nice going, critics.  Keep diggin, maybe you'll get to China.

Third point.  There's all this politics out there - real life, in other words -
& langpos seen some of that so bully for them give them tenure I say; why
hassle the academy?  Why hassle the academy?  Because you think you're
talking about poetry, & I think you're talking poetry out the door.

lumpy lumpen bourgeois delusions of the superstructure!  interpret me!
do it to me!  read me!  sigh... they're too busy reading Marx or some
such endless translated shit...)  (do you read me?  am I open enough?)
pearls before swine. water under the bridge.

John Wieners deconstructed all of it long, long ago.
"politics doesn't have the aura of literature" or something like that...
another deluded psycho poem-maker... does he further the revolution?
indeed he does; oh, his poem about Columbus Ohio is on the brink of
Althusserian bishpedoolianism... yes, I agree, we should include that
definitely in our next anthology of fucked-up heroes of the future...
did we get the $$$ for that yet?  George, where did you go last summer???

yes she does.  It's the last shot or enarly the last shot of the film, which=
 I
haven't seen in many years so don't remember many plot details but saw many
times before I stopped seeing it.  anyway he's dying in the street and she's
betrayed him in some way (to the cops? to save herself) and she watches him
die
and, preoccupied, unreadable, makes that gesture.  it's an amazing moment.

while we're at it there's Brando putting on Eva Marie Saint's dropped white
glove in On the Waterfront, stretching it as he flexes his hand.  a bit of
improvisation, supposedly--she dropped the glove by accident while they were
filming.

what else?

Passion between a man and a woman can produce a feeling of ownership on the
part of one or both.  Whether one is poet or one is not, Breton's poem is
recognizable passion.  The current discussion emerged as a result of that
recognition and rejection by a woman of a man.

My woman, my man, my love, my anything and everything flows when passion
whirls with the four winds.  However fair we have endeavored to become,
whatever archetypes we have succeeded in regulating to the siberian wastes
of our inner worlds, we are what we have experienced.  The force of passion,
by it's very nature, is demanding, uninhibited, creative and destructive.
It is the wind and fire which cleans the forest of our relationships and
makes evident the paths we choose in the aftermath, when one may beware of
Breton or embrace his passion.

     Eric Blarnes brings up Shakespeare (though he confuses one Antonio
     for another, Sebastion and Bassanio, if not Ben Jonson for Samuel
     Johnson)....
     and david bromige suggests that mr. hale's "failure" might have
     been because of the "one size fits all" quality of the poem
     and so i say (though it's easier to tell someone else what to do
     than to be one to take my own advice---to paraphrase a repeated
     shakespearean device [Portia in MV, Ophelia's rebuke of Laertes
     before she turns pliable, the Queen to Bushy or is it Bagot or
     Green in RICHARD II, LEONATO to another antonio in MUCH ADO, etc.)
     Well, Mr. Hale, if you REALLY want to bw with this woman, if
     you still want to try to woo her in words and try one more time
     (at the risk of coming off as one "romantically overobsessed" etc.),
     maybe you could write her a LETTER that JOKES about the whole
thing...
     a la the early scene ion 12TH NIGHT when VIOLA (disguised as
     Cesario) confronts Olivia with the prepared text from ORSINO
     which lies in her "MASTER'S BOSOM" and OLivia says
     "IN WHAT CHAPTER OF HIS BOSOM"??????????
     It is a great instance of one of those ways Shakespeare can have
     his "romantic" cake and eat it (or diss it) too, a way to go
     beyond a narrow sense of petrarchan poetry while at the same
     time NOT ignoring (or absolutely debasing)
     the sentiments (tho one could say ideology) that give rise to it...
     while widening the idea of "poetry" to include wit and dialogue
     and all those heteroglossic things a lot of twentiethcenturialists
     (sic) like to think is part of the "NEW".....

thanks for your response.  the freud i know is different from the one that you
describe.  as some feminists have pointed out, his is the only theory of
desire that we have.  freud has probably done as much as any man in the
ongoing effort to free women from the sexual stereotypes they were/are
expected to conform to.  i've read irigaray, paying special attention to
specuulum of the other woman, and to be truthful i wasn't particularly
impressed.  in that work her rhetoric is very intense, as intense as the time
in which it was produced.  for me irigaray will only have lasting value to the
extent that she's able to contribute a new vision of  human sexuality &
desire.  her remarks have nothing to do with psychoanalysis, but only address
the cultural mileau in which it developed.  i find her remarks on lacan,
within a context of psychoanalysis as theory, to be without any intellectual
mooring.  on the other hand, literally, she has the soul of a poet and is
worth reading just for that.  i understand my position isn't very popular
these days, but generally the opposition i encounter is from observers who
understand freud & lacan as philosophical entities that define a world view.
nothing can be further from the truth.  analysis is the most ethical praxis
because it insists that all levels of desire be acknowledged whenever there's
any human intercourse, but it is always (as olson points out)local.  as freud
advises at the beginning of the first introductory lectures, those who haven't
undertaken an analysis are in no position to comment on it.  anyway, i thought
your remark was gratuitous and deserving a at least a small response.

Hey, I've just discovered the UBPoetics archive function.
Since the beginning of February, there have been as
of this moment of writing 290 posts to Buffalo Poetics
sent from 103 email addresses. There are rumoured to be 600
subscribers (but I haven't checked), or roughly a six-to-one ratio
(or is that five-to-one?? my math...). Of those 103 active
addresses, 6 are owned and operated by Henry Gould under
various pseudonyms that this captive audience is familar with.
So far this month the average is 2.8 posts per active email address
(that's pretending Henry's 6 email addresses are separate
people; the average figure would otherwise be lower than
that). Henry Gould's total so far in February - in seven days,
that is - is 22 posts, or about ten times as many posts as
anyone else.

in response to louis cabri, sat 7 feb, on
individualism vs. singularity.

in her 1928 book, =Anarchism Is Not Enough=, laura riding
distinguishes among the "collective-real" (people in groups), the
"individual-real," (a person in relation to reality, to the "real"
world of nature, broadly considered), and the "individual-unreal."
this last sounds akin to what you are calling "singularity."  for
riding, the realm of the individual-unreal was The One worth living
for and in.  and in writing poetry one accessed this realm and
"discharged pieces of self" as she put it.  not =one=self, "but
self."  in this unreal singularity one was truest to the self and to
poetry.  and effectively truest to other people as well.  promoting
what you call the hardwon.  in participating in the institution of
publishing (though never in academia), riding wanted people to =try=
to live that individual-unreal even as she knew it was impossible.
and the only thing worth trying, while always keeping in mind its
impossiblity.
   what you wrote reminded me of her, hence the comment on
=anarchism=.  in either case the issue is maintaining one's deliberate
ideals within necessary participation in the world.  oneself as social
construction is the "individual-real"; oneself as experientially
incommensurable is the "individual-unreal," your "singularity."
we can and do have both.  at least this is my deliberate belief.
   and despite all those serious sentences, it's a belief that makes
me delirious as o'hara:
"YIPPEE!!  I'm glad I'm alive!!
I'm glad you're alive too, baby, because I want to fuck you"
("ode to michael goldberg ('s birth and other births)")

   yippee!

wow.
having just been reading freud for about 2 years or so, i havent read a
lot of the stuff that he is i think primarily cool for - interpretation of
dreams, dora, wolfman, but i could never really consider becoming, shall i
say, personally invested, in his method of "analysis," as you seem to be-

how can any "analysis" be anything OTHER than some form of rhetoric- I
hate to say that "everything's rhetorical", but isnt it? and this is also
to say that i don't attach a perjorative connotation necessarily to the
use of rheotoric - but my interest/attraction to freud is insofar as he is
so amazingly unashamed in his use of it- and it goes somethin like this:

for example,

in his lecture on femininity, he begins with
"To-day's lecture should have not place in an introduction, but it may
serve to give you an example of a detailed piece of analytic work, and I
can say two things to recommend it. It brings forward NOTHING but observed
facts (his emphasis) , almost without any speculative additions, and it
deals with a subject which has a cliam on your interest second almost to
no other.  Throughout history people have knocked heads against the riddle
of the nature of femininity.  Nor will you have escaped this
problem--those of you who are men; to those of you who are women this will
not apply--you are yourselves the problem."

PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE

Freud begins , rhetorically establishes himself a problem--WOMEN!! They
are, from the outset, taken as an aberration, the "other," as we who are
perhaps too involved in post-structuralist analysis apt to call it-

then again, maybe it isnt even MY problem, being a woman

ps. Irirgaray has a PHD in philosophy and linguistics, which makes her
on some level qualified to talk on the subject, I would think (and herself
a practitioner of psycho-analysis) - it's just that she got kicked out for
schoolin Lacan and Freud in a MAJOR WAY as a grad student at Vincennes


sorry for the "gratuitous" nature of my last post



forever female,

Dear rd,

First, there is no such thing as a gratuitous post to POETICS, so far as I
can see, and even if there were, I'm the last person you should apologize
to. In fact, my feeling is that you should apologize to NO ONE. ('I am
American artist / and I have no guilt' -- Patti Smith, the goddess).

Second, I'm not very involved with Freudianism. I don't like about it the
same things that you don't like. Freud did bring us some good things, in my
opinion, including the theory and science of the unconscious, but he has his
failings which I am tired of trying to to step around.

I prefer Lacan, Kristeva, and Irigary, in fact, to Freud. But I felt that
the previous post was managing to elide the non-European, non-theoretical
world that teems. Hence what I said.

Best wishes,
jra

jb comments:

>as freud

>undertaken an analysis are in no position to comment on it.

reminds me uncomfortably of some of the viet nam vets with whom i work
(actually, the ones with whom i prefer not to work) who say, "man, if you
haven't been there you got no right to talk about it."
experience=authority.  makes it hard to talk about the civil war, say (or
maybe easier, since all who 'know' are dead and can't argue no more).
still, seems essentially an anti-intellectual position, not tenable here.
one might as easily argue that those who have gone through psychanalysis
are among the least qualified to talk about it cuz of all the money & time
they've invested.  cognitive dissonance, y'know?  like what makes a marine
figure boot camp made him a 'man.' i mean, it *better* have, right?

>freud has probably done as much as any man in the
>ongoing effort to free women from the sexual stereotypes they were/are
>expected to conform to.

hmmm. the freud *i* know has done more than most men to provide ammunition
for those who wish to preserve sexual stereotypes to which women were/are
supposed to conform. most of all, perhaps, by creating/justifying the
'psychoanalytic relationship,' which is a hierarchical analyst/patient
relationship based on the 'authority' of the analyst. i don't care for
irigary particularly, but monique wittig, whose work i like very much,
has something to say about this...

>analysis is the most ethical praxis
>because it insists that all levels of desire be acknowledged whenever there's
>any human intercourse, but it is always (as olson points out) local.

and this is exactly what i don't like about psychoanalysis--the position of
moral superiority it assumes (must assume by virtue of its self-definition)
over all other philosophies, while, at the same time, insisting it is not
a 'philosophy' and is therefore above the sort of criticism that philosophies
must endure. psychoanalytic theorists have seemed to me to be eurocentric to
an extreme that would be laughable if the discipline weren't so powerfully
entrenched.

klaus theweleit, who writes so brilliantly on male fantasies, has done a
rather pretty study of freud's own desires in his slim volume,
_object-choice_.

sticking my head out of the hole in which i've been working...

Well Joe, on this list I'm not surprised at any of the whiffs some folks seem

after all eurocentric thru & thru -- as is everyone else on this net.
However, if you have some textual citations, or if you are yourself a
practicing buddhist who's managed to cross the cultural boundry that Whorf
declares is impossible to cross, I'm willing to take instruction.  Ditto for
Dylan & Johnson.  One shouldn't confuse an aesthetic for a theory.  I also see
no reason why Johnson's express of desire should be any scarier than yours.

In the first place to say that everything is rhetoric is to imply that in this
regards all things are equal.  I don't believe that such is the case.  I'm not
trying to argue that Freud was a feminist, or that his remarks about women
generally are au current with contemporary ideas on the subject.  Freud was a
member of the viennese bourgoise, this is no secret.  But the expanse and
strength of Freud is his discovery of unconscious processes, and to point out
the extent to which arrested desire determined conscious thought.  This was an
unpopular thought then, and it's an unpopular thought now; but the whole basis
of the freudian method is devoted to the bringing into conscious thought as
much as possible of what was heretofore denied to it.

If ethical behavior requires one to consider all of the possibilities of an
action before deciding how to act, then the freudian method must be viewed as
ethical in both praxis and result, and Freud's ethics, if you remember, are
what we're discussing.  There's a difference between being wrong, and being
unethical.

What you or I choose  to embrace in our respective searches isn't germane to
the discussion, except that as you don't have the experience as to what's
valuable in freudian analysis, you're left to critiques of matters that
practically speaking are not meaningful to any discussion of it.

You don't have to step around Freud's failings any more than modernists have
to apologize for the brutality of Pound, who has a hell of a lot more to
answer for.  What's interesting in Freud is what seems to interest you.  As
far as liking Lacan is concerned, Lacan is so freudian that for a long time he
was the only commentator who seemed to understand him; one simply can't
separate Lacan from Freud except in the extensions of freudian thought he was
able to master.  As Lacan points out, if you don't understand Freud, you can't
understand him.

Eric Blarnes, Jack Spandrift, and that new list member Ben Carrelis are
more complete individuals than I am.  They contradict me constantly,

probably still be sending sonnets about his "papa" the carpenter.

I will say, though, Louis, that after that last over-the-top Gould

battle for indie-crit has been a resounding victory (as I'm sure all 600

I wrote my words on "ma femme" in too much of a hurry, the way
one will *insist* on something knowing one hasn't the right amount
of time/attention to _explore_ that same thing. As compensation for
not having the time/attention to explore it. As if "I don't have the
time not to be right about this."

The result was I was incorrect and also that I ignored
the context I was writing about. That Breton's poem
was *not* about his wife makes my insistance on the
meaning of the term look all the more foolish, don't
you agree?

Freud's weirdnesses about sexuality and women and the irrefutability of
psychoanalysis are all well-known, and beyond justification. But...

I like his refusal to accept things at face value.

I like his conviction that if you look long enough you will find another motive.

I like his belief that all things are signs of other things.

I like his ambivalence about culture.

I like his passion for the primitive.

I like his semitism in the face of all that anti-semitism.

I trust his motives more than, say, Jung's.

Hi Kali.

(pog goes public?)

One interesting avenue here: a lot of the sharpest critiques (I mean--in my
opinion--smartest, not most stinging) of Freud have been written by using
Freud's own analytic techniques on Freud's text (and not to show that they're
impoverished techniques, but the reverse): Kristeva and Irigaray, esp.  Like:
Freud tells us somewhere (dream book) that if the analysand says about a dream
"I dunno who that woman in the dream was, but one thing I DO know is that it
was NOT my mother," we can read "that was my mother."  So Kristeva: when Freud
insists that the only unambivalent relationship in human intercourse is
between
mother and infant son, we can safely read..... And then this becomes part of a
terrific essay, "Place Names" in /Desire in Language/.  There's also Sam Weber
and Neil Hertz, in this vein.

see you around the neighborhood,

Freud's major ethical failing (that was the beginning of the thread, no?) lies, I
believe, way beyond the gender question discussed these  last few days on the list.
The man did come up with the concundrum of the "death instinct" and then used it to
justify the wholesale slaughter of millions during World War One, with no gender
distinction. "It's not the Kaiser, its your own lil'ole Thanatos makes you wanna
inhale that nasty stuff .  So just get back down into them trenches and breathe in
deeply..."

Wait a minute, wait a minute. I know that, this being the Poetics List,
rhetoric is the final judge. But please tell me where exactly Freud applies
the death wish to "justify the wholesale slaughter of millions during World

This is a good reminder that to use the phrase "my X" does not always imply
ownership of X, just a relationship to X.

The recent Freud & Ron Silliman/Jeff Derksen list
discussions might segue well into this announcement of
PhillyTalk 4: new work by & a dialogue between Jena
Osman & Tina Darragh.

Tidbits:

Dreams, Tina writes in the newsletter, "are not limited to
Freudian analysis." Her recent "Dream Rims" poems, for
instance (see example in Chain #4), "obliterate," according
to Jena, "the concept of dreams as something to decode."

Tina considers Joan Retallack's important essay
":Re:Thinking:Literary:Feminism: (three essays onto shaky
grounds)" as the "companion piece to what Ron & Jeff have
written about re: community/dialogue" (see PhillyTalks #3).

For Tina & Jena it seems the outcome is a new means &
meaning for claims of what might be called sub-sentential
language use, as well as for distinguishing "chance" &
"error" in, on one hand, Joan & Tina & Jena's work, & on
the other, John Cage and Jackson Mac Low's.

Selection of books & articles they discuss:

Tina Darragh, Striking Resemblance (Burning Deck, 1989);
a(gain)2st the odds (Potes & Poets, 1989); adv. fans - the
1968 series (Leave Books, n.d.); Interview with Tina
Darragh by Joan Retallack (Rod Smith's _Aerial_ #5, 1989)

Jena Osman, Twelve Parts of Her (Burning Deck, 1989);
underwater dive - version one (paradigm press, 1990);
Amblyopia (Avenue B, 1993); recent poems at her Buffalo
website & in Conjunctions (Spring '97)

Joan Retallack, "Poethics of a Complex Realism," _John
Cage: Composed in America_, eds. Marjorie Perloff &
Charles Junkerman (U Chicago P, 1994);

PhillyTalk 4 is available for $2 (or donation) from me at
4331 Pine St., #1R, Philadelphia, PA, 19104.

Don't forget that this ongoing dialogue will culminate in #6,
the response issue to #s 1-5, for which I am now
encouraging contributions (deadline May 1st) - but more on
that later.


***

I should also say, for the record, that Jeff Derksen couldn't have
responded to all that Ron Silliman had to say because Ron had, as
it happened to work out, the last word in the exchange in #3.

Kent, about the Breton poem.  (And, indeed, about feminist analysis in
culture in general, in relation to most things going on in our culture...)

And, for that matter, this is also a point about poetry, I think...

I have trouble with your unmodulated response to the Breton poem and its
(pretty complex) resonances on the level of sexual politix...*Why* does
your appreciation of the thing as a fairly compelling piece of poetry
preclude there being something (as you put it) *wrong* with it??  As I
suggested in a post a number of days ago, its being vibrant and compelling
as poetry simply makes it more the case (not less) that it's disturbing
and perturbing.  (I prefer these words to "wrong").

As for what it is that's disturbing and perturbing...Well, that has to do
with the isolation of the woman as an isolated icon, reduced to erotic
attributes devoid of agency, that can be typified (but does not entirely
derive from) the petrarchian poetry mode..and the way this links to
various modes of consciouness and behavior that rob people in general of
agency and dignity, but which are particularly built into patriarchal
cultural patterns.

A poem can have plenty "right" about it, but still also have plenty
"wrong" about it.  Poetry (like reality, with which it has much in common)
often has a number of dimensions at once!

Henry,

I don't imagine even you imagine that you are the Loner you think you are.
If you were you wouldn't be preaching the "Indie" Gospel to the heathen, or
engaging so much on the POetics list in general. I don't have my books at
this computer terminal: could someone please quote Oppen into the Poetics
Record ("the isolated man fails . . . but I will listen")?

But what bugs me, Henry, is that you deliberately misread (or overread) a
term like "mutual comradeship." Bad Henry, naughty and obdurate!

(The "mutual" by the way I take from Kropotkin's MUTUAL AID, a book that
debunks "survival of the fittest" (capitalism) and instead stresses, well,
mutual aid among species (lower case-ism); and "comrade" I use in the
literary sense Jennifer Moxley does, which is appropriate and endearing.)
How you extracted "uncritical promotion" from my post is hardly worth
addressing and I am only writing this because I like you, buddy.

If anything the spirit of PAX goes AGAINST movements, but promotes
COMMUNICATION between individual poets. Besides, Louis Cabri has already
noted that you are a movement within yourself: Gould promotes Spandrift,
Spandrift promotes Blarnes, Blarnes promotes Spandrift promoting Gould . . .
so there's a taint of hypocrisy in all this.

Also, my apologies to Jeff Derksen for saying he failed to address some
comments of Ron's. As was pointed out to me, Ron's word was the last in that
exchange.

Please forgive my transgressions, for I have published from one of the many
fierce debates catalogued in your archives.  Forgive my diabolical and
unsubstantiated outbursts, yay, surely the symptoms of a deranged character.
Forgive me for pointing out that orthodox opinion on this list goes
unchallenged, but that statements of heretical nature are reviled and torn
into shreds.  Forgive me for persevering where I am not welcome.  Forgive
me for making enemies of sheep and for blowing spit wads at the guardians of
moral virtues.  Forgive me for recognizing the contradicitons of values, where
the subject-less superiority of the lang-poem is maintained by agressive egos
who have invested much into the maintenance of their identities as morally
conscious social poets.  Forgive my irascibility and my corruptive presence.
Forgive me for not knowing my place.  Forgive my bad manners.  Forgive me for
saying that the sacred realm of poetry is nothing more than a series of
business transactions.  Forgive me for questioning the thin facades of power.
Forgive me for ignoring mine enemies'logic.  Forgive my own reductive claims
about the inferiority of the university:  it is only inferior for poets (&
o poets, how many of you will be granted permission to work within those
walls?  how many really want to?).  Forgive me for saying, Let those without
blemish cast the first stone.  Forgive me for not letting the names of my
friends go publicly condemneded in my presence, with only vile and jealous
substantiations that resound with alarming emptiness.  Forgive me for
swimming with sharks and for disrupting the stupor of the community my
enemies guard.  Forgive me for not playing the game by your rules.  And again,
forgive me for publishing those email threads in which my magazine went
publicly descried.  For I have not sought to better my position, but to
reveal the depth of contradiction at work in the mechanations of the poetic
court.  For my belief in the historical presence and reality of the poem
grates against the social protocol of those who have turned poetry into mere
language, wresting from it the emotional and vital power of an active
intelligence.  Yay, for we are all deep in the shadows of our own selfish
progress, deep in the obscurities of our private wills.  Forgive me, for
those who crave power shall find it and those who crave poetry will make
it.  And from this conflict the rest of the world will lift its hind leg
dog-like and piss as it has always done.  But I humble myself now before
you o master.  For I see that my uncouth presence reveals how firmly fastened
are your walls.  I shall take my meat and bread in the forest and wait
there, with Sir Henry and a merry band of revellers complete with lute and
tabor.  We'll light a fire, drink strong mead and wassail that graciousness
that lets us live.  Like all good politicians, ye have mastered the double
talk of rhetoric.   Language is truly a tool of the great.

In addition to these works, I'd add Marie Balmary's book, translated into
English as _Psychoanalyzing Psychoanalysis: Freud and the Hidden Fault of
the Father_ (Johns Hopkins, 1982. trans by Ned Lukacher). The French
title, by the way, sounds a lot cooler: _L'homme aux statues: freud et la
faute cache du pere_.

Dan, I don't think I extracted anything from your poem.  I asked you how
"mutual comradeship" addresses the issue of uncritical nepotism.  If you
don't think this is worth addressing, we don't have much to talk about on
this particular issue.  Comradeship is one thing; a covenant which
establishes justice is another.  There is nothing without the poison of
the law.  Law and love are an insecapable mutuality. The law for workers
in poetry is WHAT'S ON THE PAGE.

These alter-guys also point out the limitations & lacunae of Gould.  It's
a 2-way street.  Of course there's no ultimate Loner Genius.  That's bull!
 But I see an element of ethics involved in the individual writer
standing by his or her word.  Ethics as well as sheer INTEREST.  I don't deny
that great art is made by groups of people working closely together. Or
that critics themselves learn from each other in groups & apprenticeships
& shared vocabulary. All I've said from the beginning is that my experience
of making poetry involves solitude, privacy, individuality, and the search
for authenticity and originality.  I'm not bragging - I think this is the
average experience of it. & I simply extend this practice to the art of
writing criticism - & I think it's a great advantage - if it can be done -
in weighing what a piece of writing accomplishes irrespective of the
ambitions of its author.  I'm sorry list if I repeat myself, but I feel
CHALLENGED to defend my position. I agree with you, Dan, that a peaceful
mutuality between poets is often extremely productive and leads to
new plateaus of development.  This has happened in my life continually -
I don't live in a cave making poems out of bearshit, believe it or not.
But in the end the bottom line of mutual respect between artists lies
ON THE PAGE, not in the buddy system.  & if I don't like your work I'm
going to tell you so.  This is basic ethics of "mutuality".  - Henry Gould

In Japanese, the word "shi" is both "four" and "death" as well. Many =
superstitious Japanese replace "four" with a nonsense word when giving =
addresses, phone numbers, etc. that contain a four.

Tea cups are sold in sets of five, and if one cup is broken, the whole set =

Now, I love Freud--because he's so dark and sticky and he added the word
"uncanny" to my vocabulary.  But, how could one possibly consider Freud and
not consider the "cultural mileau" in which his theories were developed?
One should never forget that his wonderfully twisted and sicko model of the
human psyche is just that--a model.

My office is at New College, and the other day when I was in the kitchen
slicing my daily orange, I heard this woman's voice booming from down the
hallway, "What people forget is that Freud destroyed an entire generation!"
I copied that into the journal.  Received wisdom.

great post, dodie.  now, my personal fondness for freud stems from the
dumbest and most ethnocentric of reasons --he was jewish and enjoyed being
jewish.  most of his clientele was not simply the viennese bougeoisie, but
the *jewish* viennese bourgeoisie (mostly women, too).  the photos of him
fleeing nazified vienna for london in his eighties are heartbreaking.  sure
his vision was limited and patriarchal, why wouldn't it be?  you don't have
to swallow something wholesale in order to find it productive, moving,
interesting, suggestive.  i'd say the nazis destroyed an entire generation
--several in fact --about three.  but "freud destroyed" has a nicer rhyme.

May I propose that this nicely condenses and closes Henry's
protracted and snit-causing argument? Now if everyone can agree that
community and comradeship can be _deepened_ by mutual, vigorous and
public critique among friends...  And this list-space might be a good
testing ground of that: For example, Mark Wallace challenges himself
to write a review that is critical of Steve Evans's ethereal, Ecole
de Paris criticism (he might say, for example, that Steve has proven
to us that he knows one hell of a lot about Hegel and French cinema,
but how on earth does this _really_ relate to the poetry he likes),
giving Steve a chance to show that he takes Mark's critique in
Hegelian spirit by publishing one of Mark's lectures as an ILS
pamphlet (something which, of course, everyone now wants to have),
followed by a searing, leave-em-at-a-loss riposte as appendix from
Jordan Davis; Dan Bouchard, who edited the fine and late Mass. Ave.
might writie a review, reflecting seriously on whether the poems by
Susan Schultz and Lisa Jarnot were really representative of their
best work, and then reflecting in turn on whether the buddy-system
had something to do with him publishing them instead of the poems of
someone not already in the mutual back-scratching name-loop; Henry
himself might take the embarrassingly fawning review he recently
wrote of fellow Providencer Jennifer Moxley and re-write it in true
indie-crit style, offering that perhaps this review was so obsequious
that it might even be taken as an unintended parody of everything
that is wrong with buddy-crit, and so on.

The possibilities are endless. These would be just a few quick
suggestions. But it would be fantastic if everyone could go after
those they admire (and I admire all those I have mentioned above)
without anyone getting pissed off! All hands on board the ship called
Comrade, its nuclear weapons polished and ready for use, if
necessary, to slow the spread of weapons of mass destruction! (This
last sentence has no intended relationship to what precedes it, but
in the manner of poetry's accidental accretions perhaps it may.
May have a relationship, that is.)

          an electronic quarterly on the art of Gertrude Stein

invites submissions, both critical and creative, in written, visual, and
aural media.

Recent Stein criticism has addressed such issues as her postmodern
disjunctive style, representation and the body, exile and bio/geography,
and Stein's connection with the other arts.  Some criticism has tried to
reconstruct her texts, reading them from the point of view of queer,
ethnic, and theological studies.  Artists have set her words to other
words, to visual art, to music, and to performance.   In other words, the
vastly expanding field of Stein studies today ranges from textual and
psychoanalytic observations to cultural studies and
artistic experiments.

In this context, an ongoing examination of how we make sense of Stein in
our time is due.  _Time-Sense_ welcomes written submissions from all
theoretical, critical, and creative approaches, and artistic submissions
in all reproducible media.

I had thought Freud pretty much discredited, both ethically and
scientifically, except in the academic humanities where it doesn't matter
whether a theory is valid, as long as it serves the purposes of an
argument.  In Crews'  debate with the analysts in the NYRB the
psychoanalysts basically concede all his important points, but still
persist in their devotion to the Master.

For anyone thinking Freud was ethical a look at his correspondence with
Fliess should be instructive.

As for theories of desire Freud got his from literature in the first
place.  I think we have lots of them, e.g. in  Petrarch.

I tend to agree with Mark. There's no such thing, really, as an
uncomplicated, unmediated sexual response, whether in a poem or in a
bed. We may think that in the throes of passion we're throwing propriety
out the window (bye-bye!) but usually we're just substituting one set of
responses  - or subtle agreements - for another. I don't mean to sound
reductionist here, as though we're simply a bunch of automatons engaged
in baboon-sex or whatever. But I do think that in general we're a lot
less free than we typically imagine ourselves to be. The transparent
liberating gesture is a simplicity arrived at only through great labor.

Breton's poem is brimming with linguistic invention and brio - but it
still posits woman as vessel, as inspiratrix, as the passive receptacle
of the Other, a repository denied agency - and this is where metaphysics
and erotics run headlong into each other smack! ker-pow! Breton's litany
- like so much of his stuff - has, to me, a distinctly and carefully
programmatic feel, not automatic at all, but exactly plotted. Notice how
much of the imagery conflates his wife with nature - nature with a
capital N as the ultimate tragic invention, perhaps, of the objectifying
erotic male gaze, all those raped virgin acres of "The Gift Outright,"
etc. Breton's language takes this unnamed woman and makes of her a
monument to worship, make love to, whatever - it transforms her
miraculously into everything, it seems, but what she is. But maybe
that's all he - or anyone - can do.

And lest anyone think I'm a cold fish, I'll confess that my own love
poems are drowning in nature imagery too. Romantic love, which is a
cultural refinement - a behavioral evolution as well as an ethical one
- just seems so damned "natural." Well, maybe it is at that. Though I
tend to think not. Rather, it's a case where culture has improved on the
existing, "natural" state of affairs, even though it feels like love is
a Return to some originary, primal state. So that the cultural becomes
the natural. And the source of much confusion.

Making it up as I go along,

Kent, about the Breton poem.  (And, indeed, about feminist analysis in
culture in general, in relation to most things going on in our
culture...)

And, for that matter, this is also a point about poetry, I think...

I have trouble with your unmodulated response to the Breton poem and its
(pretty complex) resonances on the level of sexual politix...*Why* does
your appreciation of the thing as a fairly compelling piece of poetry
preclude there being something (as you put it) *wrong* with it??  As I
suggested in a post a number of days ago, its being vibrant and
compelling
as poetry simply makes it more the case (not less) that it's disturbing
and perturbing.  (I prefer these words to "wrong").

As for what it is that's disturbing and perturbing...Well, that has to
do
with the isolation of the woman as an isolated icon, reduced to erotic
attributes devoid of agency, that can be typified (but does not entirely
derive from) the petrarchian poetry mode..and the way this links to
various modes of consciouness and behavior that rob people in general of
agency and dignity, but which are particularly built into patriarchal
cultural patterns.

A poem can have plenty "right" about it, but still also have plenty
"wrong" about it.  Poetry (like reality, with which it has much in
common)
often has a number of dimensions at once!

Now, listers, I would ask you to turn to page ### in your EPC archives, as
Comrade Kent suggested, and re-read carefully the Moxley review by Gould he
describes.  "Fawning" is the word; uncritical or sub-critical it surely is.
Now go out & buy the book if it's not out of print yet. Gould never claimed
to be much of a critic himself.  That's why he's looking so hard for one.

Kent, can we call the ship "Sophie" instead?  I'll explain some day.

In Korea, at least when I lived there, buildings did not have fourth
floors.  Well, they had them, but they were numbered five.  It was
explained to me that four signified death (chuk ul sa--deathly four, or,
maybe four, signifying death), though the Korean words for "four" (both
of them--sa and nyet)are not the same as the word for "death,"  at least
not the one that I know (chuk um).  Perhaps the four/death equation has
some relation to Chinese having been the written language of Korea for
many hundreds of years, though the Chinese words always (or almost
always, at least) had Korean pronunciations, which is why the phonetic
match may not be true.

But now, on further research (my wife looked in a dictionary for me--a
good place to go when thinking about what a word might mean, I guess).
The Korean word for death based on the Chinese is "sa-mang," and the
"chuk ul sa" above may very well be using the "sa" of "sa-mang," which
indeed does sound like the "sa" for four. So, there you go.

It's nice to finally find something to disagree on with Mark P and
Pat P. But guys, I just don't see Breton's poem as sexist in any
way. That the addressee has no "agency" does not seem a good
argument: Should everyone in a poem have "agency"? And besides, I
don't see Breton as having much macho agency in this poem at
all--why, he's reduced to a kind of primal glossolalia, the femme
doing jiu-jitsu flips on the poor man's capacity to think "like a
man" and bring her under the power and control of his reason.

It may be that you're right, Pat, that sexual expression is
predominantly a cultural construction, but I don't think so. Each
culture has its own rituals and oddities to be sure, but in sex, at
bottom (though here I want to say that I don't consider myself an
expert, because I've only had sex once--when I was nineteen), all
cultures exhibit _animal_ behavior. I don't mean "animal" like when
one gets excited and just goes crazy-- I mean in the sense of
ritualistically objectifying the other, of focusing on the desired
one without giving a hoot for his or her "agency"; I mean fixating on
body parts, and showing the other your own "parts", whether the
showing be a blue, bulging throat, a crimson rump shoved into the
air, or a love poem full of surrealist images.

Anyway, speaking of the animal kingdom, I did just get something from
Eliot Weinberger apropos this discussion-- a wonderful little essay
on the poetry of Sappho in the context of zebra finches,
Australian bush turkeys, Archbold bowerbirds, guppies, cichlids,
cockroaches, aphids, bonolos, echidnas, crocodiles, and other
creatures great and small doing their poignant best to have
sex with others of their kind. It is titled "Sex Objects," and it
begins with a quote from a Poetry Flash review of Guy Davenport's _7
Greeks_: "For those who object to sexual objectification, Sappho may
present problems."

If anyone would like to see this, I'd be happy to forward
back-channel. A great read.

In the best Buddhist tradition, I'll say that I am hardly in a position to
instruct anyone. My practices of sitting and writing are more than adequate
to reinforce my claim to ordinary understanding of ordinary things.

If you are looking for texts, see my previous post to the list.

For Dylan, see the album DESIRE.

And, yes, Robert Johnson's aesthetic is scarier than mine. I never wrote,
after all:

        Me and the Devil walkin' side by side.
        Gonna beat my woman till I'm satisfied.

For a look at Johnson, see the recent complete Robert Johnson on (I think it
is) Atlantic. The set is in any case extremely available, includes all the
songs Johnson recorded, and contains complete biographical information and
the text of the complete lyrics.

You're right that one shouldn't confuse an aesthetic for a theory. An
aesthetic is preferable.

This is the nut of ONE of my problems with Freudianism.

After all, Joe, why should you assume to judge the validity of anyone's
experience, even mine? And yes, there are others besides you who have
experienced Freud at depth. And who disagree with what you say here.

Dear Joe,

Your reference to Pound is spot on. I have been stepping around Mr. EP for a
very long time now. He is still the Modernist of choice for me. I can't
apologize for him, I find much of what he did deplorable, but I greatly
admire the Cantos.

I also prefer Mr. Freud to Mr. Jung and to many of the current maifestations
of psychiatry. But I AM tired of stepping around him. I guess this makes me
a neo-Poundian, not a neo-Freudian (my admiration for Mr. Lacan
nothwithstanding).

I received my copy the other day. It's very handsomely done. I'm still not
sure what critical tools to use in discussing these entities (perhaps
entirely new ones), but I am much intrigued by the shapes and thoughts and
desires that coalesce out of the swirl of words and commands. I hope to
write more about the book in the coming weeks. Just recovering from
bronchitis myself. Is it the poet's disease (dis-ease?) of the 1990s???!!!

congrats to Chris and Alan.

the jennifer julu interchanges were to my liking, one of the most
inviting subtexts passing thru the poetic list, & I too was hot to
publish these works thru Xexoxial, but being years behind on commitments
Im gratified that Chris has transmogrified alan's digital yearnspeak to
the world of books & paper.

I love Freud. I really do love him. I think he's a great writer--very
funny. Smart. Witty. Clever--

But how can he be credited with "liberating" desire? With "allowing" us to
speak our true minds? (It seems that some of the lauding of Freud that has
gone on in this thread has to do with such liberations--)

So I have two questions:

1. Let's just say Freud (particularly Interp of Dreams) allows us to
examine our "sublimated" desires--to acknowledge what we truly
desire--perhaps expunging it? How is this different than the confessional?
In what ways is it a discourse that allows us to go beyond the
confessional and enter the realm of the therapeutic? If I am a woman of
Freud's era, how will it help me to know what I "reallY' feel? If I am a
frustrated subject--politically, economically, and intellectually
oppressed by my society, then what good does it do me to understand my
true desires? In other words:

Who is allowed to desire?
Who is able to do something about their desires?
How is psychoanalysis a means toward pacification?
These are old questions--but I think still refute the notion that Freud
liberated desire in any sense--

2. How is the location, identification, desublimation etc of imbricated
with the writing of poetry? With the production of art? Is art a form of
desublimation? Is a psychoanalytic model of desire anathema to the
production of art? Is a discourse that is buttressed by the concepts of
"normalcy" andthe recognition of perhaps anti-social desire anti-artistic?
I am not harkening back to the suicidal poet model here--the
psychoanalysis of Plath or Sexton--but rather to the very notion which
seems to be present in this thread that Freud is good because his
discourse helps us to REAVEAL what had previously been CONCEALED. Tillich,
for one, defines religion as that which passes from man to god--revelation
as that which passes from god to man. How can a discourse based on
revelation be anything but corrupt? Be anything but a tool for those who
wish to control? Be anything but dangerous?

I guess I have a third question as well. How is Freud anything other than
the logical conclusion to intellectual impulses of the sixteenth century?
I have a quote to follow, but am afraid I will get cut off by my phone...
so I'll continue in another post--

Cordially,
Katy

It seems to me that Freud's "trick" is a pretty old one--

"Let us call the totality of the learning and skills that enable one to
make the signs speak and to discover their meaning, hermeneutics; let us
call the totality of the learning and skills that enable one to
distinguish the location of the signs, to define what constitutes them as
signs, and to know how and by what laws they are linked, semiology: the
sixteenth century superimposed hermeneutics and semiology in the form of
similitude. To search for a meaning is to bring to light a resemblance. To
search for the law governing signs is to discover the things that are
alike. The grammar of beings is an exegesis of these things.... 'Nature'
is trapped in the thin layer that holds semiology and hermeneutics one
above the other; it is neither mysterious nor veiled, it offers itself to
our cognition which it sometimes leads astray, only in so far as this
superimpositionnecessarily includes a slight degree  of non-coincidence
between the resemblances.... A dark space appears which must be made
progressively clearer. That space is where 'nature' resides, and it is
what one must attempt to know...."

(Foucault: Order of Things, pp. 29-30)

Then Freud:

"There is often a passage in even the most thoroughly interpreted dream
which has to be left obscure; this is because we become aware during the
work of interpretation that at that point there is a tangle of
dream-thoughtswhich cannot be unravelled and which moreover adds nothing
to our knowlegde of the content of the dream. This is the dream's navel,
the spot where it reaches down into the unknown. The dream-thoughts to
which we are led by interpretation cannot, from the nature of things, have
any definite endings: they are bound to branch out in every direction into
the intricate netweork of our world of thought. It is at some point where
this meshwork is particularly close that the dream-with grows up, like a
mushroom out of its mycelium.:
(Interp. p. 564 Avon, 1965)

Then Foucault:

Such, sketched in its most general aspects, is the sixteenth-century
episteme. This configuration carries with it...(cont in next message...)

...a certain number of consequences.
        "First and foremost, the plethoric yet absolutely poverty-stricken
character of this knowldge. Plethoric because it is limitless. Resemblance
never remains stable within itself; it can be fixed only if it refers back
to another similitude, which then, in turn, refers to others; each
resemblance, therefore has value only from the accumulation of all the
others, and the whole world must be explored if even the slightest of
analogies is to be justified and finally take on the appearance of
certainty....And for this reason, from its very foundations, this
knowledge will be a thing of sand. The only possible form of link between
the elements of this knowledge is addition. Hence those immense columns of
complilation, hence their monotony. By positing resemblance as the link
between signs and what they indicate..., sixteenth century knowldge
condemned itself to never knowing anything but the same thing, and to
knowing that thing only at the unattainable end of an endless journey.
(Order of Things. p. 30)

Then Freud:

(One could open Interp almost anywhere--)

But how about....HERE!

"Dreams of missing a train deserve to be put alongside examination dreams
on account of the similarity of their affect, and their explanation shows
that we shall be right in doing so. They are dreams of consolation for
another kind of anxiety felt in sleep--the fear of dying. 'Departing' on a
journey is one of the commonest and best authenticated symbold of
death..." (p. 420)

Or HERE!

"In an analysis which I was conducting in French a dream came up for
interpretation in which I appeared as an elephant. I naturally asked the
dreamer why I was respresented in that form. 'Vous me trompez' ['you are
deceiving me'] was his reply (trompe='trunk').

        "The dream-work can often succees in representing very refractory
material, such as proper names, by a far-fetched use of out-of-the-way
associations...."
(p. 448)

In other words--I think Freud is terrif to read--a brilliant poet, if you
will--but I don't credit him with inventing a discourse that in any way,
shape, or form liberated desire--

Rather he seems to be the apotheosis of an impulse toward "knowledge" that
began in the 16th century and had as one of its primary objects the taming
of "irrationality" and thus the urther denial of the kinds of desires that
Freud purportedly "resues" or "dredges up" or otherwise
"desublimates"--how is this different, again, than the confessional? How
is this any kind of liberation? As a woman I feel that Freud has done
little to help me out--

In his wake I see lots of talk-shows and diet plans--lots ofmen who claim
that I or some other woman is delusional--hysterical etc.

I know that Freud may not have meant for such ramifications--but they are
real--and are in many regards his legacy.

I don't think there is anyfeasible way to claim that Freud helped women,
regardless of the historical context in which he worked--

(I think that Marx--another thinker whose ideas have been popularized--is
a good counterexample--an interesting contrast to Freud in that Marxist
disurses seem difficult to bend toward any form of "oppression"--whetheer
of wmen. of men. or of children--of black, white, or red etc)

Yours! (Sorry for the length, there...)

In November 1997, Jacket was the featured Internet site on the Electronic
Poetry Center at the State University of New York at Buffalo. The EPC is a
leading experimental poetry site.

In December 1997, Jacket was among the top recommended sites on Web Del
Sol, a major literary arts Internet conglomerate site in the US.

In December 1997, Jacket won the "Best of the Web" award from the Poetry
Mining Company, an Internet site in New York.

The first issue of Jacket contains interviews with English poet Roy Fisher
and Australian aboriginal poet Lionel Fogarty, a piece on cyber-poetry in
the age of the Internet, a look at the 1943 hoax poet Ern Malley (including
rare childhood photos!) , work by Charles Bernstein, Elaine Equi, Pamela
Brown, Alfred Corn, Joanne Burns, Tracy Ryan, Carl Rakosi, Beth Spencer,
Peter Minter, Susan Schultz and Paul Hoover, together with reviews, other
prose and poetry pieces and plentiful photos and art work. Jacket # 1 was
complete in October 1997.

Jacket # 3 is being uploaded as we speak, and will be complete in late
April 1998. It already contains poems by Joel Lewis, Michele Leggott, Kris
Hemensley, Peter Gizzi, Hans Magnus Enzensberger, Tom Clark and Johanna
Drucker, and a review of Charles Nicholl's enlightening biography "Somebody
Else - Rimbaud in Africa".

Issue # 3 is dedicated to the memory of the Australian poet JOHN FORBES,
who died unexpectedly on 23 January at the age of 47 at his home in
Melbourne. It contains a poem by him ("Speed: A Pastoral"), and poems by
some of his friends.

Jacket is free, and (thus) is at present unable to pay contributors.
Also, I don't have the time yet to deal with unsolicited submissions. Sorry.

I think we are looking at this, as we did the Breton poem, as if our
contemporary politics were applicable in Breton's/Freud's time. I don't
think a bourgeois woman of Freud's time would have conceptualized her
self as "politically, economically, and intellectually
>oppressed by ...society."

It's always seemed to me that Freud's suggestion that there is a part of
people that is NOT bound by civilization's mores, that is grasping and
aggressive and violent and animal, and most importantly, not subject to
simple conscious controls, to banishing that "bad impulse" was amost
dramatic and amazing concept to come up with given HIS place in history.
And he realized that our narratives are how we FIND and come to terms
with these hidden inner realities (and I've always thought that idea
quite poetic).

But as far as questions like _Who is allowed to desire? Who is able to
do something about their desires? How is psychoanalysis a means toward
pacification?_ go, I think they are based on a contemporary discourse
that would not have registered in Freud's time.

Oh, and there's a wonderful book by Peter Gay (who also wrote a Freud
bio), called _The Bourgeois Experience_ and for a spectacular poetic
account of an analysis (a woman's analysis) by a Freud-like analyst,
check out Marie Cardinal's _The Words to Say It_, a beautifully written
book regardless your interest or non-interest in psychoanalysis.

Admittedly, I love Freud, and enjoyed (okay, largely in retrospect) my
own analysis immensely. But I would hazard to say what brings analysis
(at least in my case) from confessional to theraputic (though "therapy"
doesn't do the process justice) may well be the quality of the "evenly
hovering attention" of an analyst who can feel/withstand/encompass the
analysand's emotions while NOT inserting himself into the narrative as a
confessor.

Henry--

I think that by far the best "criticism" of a poem is a new poem--

As far as the Evans article--I don't think of it as "criticism" so much as
"elucidation"--

Perhaps the young/old thing is an old and oft-addressed problem--but it
doesn't mean that it doesn't need re-stating generation after generation--

And Evans states it beautifully--in beautiful language--

And clearly--in terms that I can understand--

I LOVE HIS ESSAY!

And thank god for the mental blinders--otherwise I might be blinded by
your utter brilliance--

Lisa, to me you have recuperated what Riding's words
worked for when they worked for poetry.

"Unreal" strikes me as one of those frequent words of hers
that is attempting to do and say more than its cultural
grammar can at the time support. Oppositional matrices -
"real" vs."unreal" - fade before its sense.

What is the lineage of the "individual-unreal"?

What if it were Whitman! Not "precipitant of the American
character," as the standard critical reading has it, but he who
differentiates between individualism, which "isolates," and
"personalism," which "fuses, ties, and aggregates . . .
fraternizing all" (_Democractic Vistas_). "Personalism" thus
is not identical to personal expression.

I've found numerous historical resonance for this word, but
Whitman's usage, it seems, is distinct.

Anyone who can help me would be very welcome.

Nothing was washed away, but perhaps some people stayed away from the
Duncan tribute February 5th because our local weathermen were predicted 5
inches of rain and winds of 80 miles an hour . . .  Nevertheless hordes of
people came and they were just about hanging from the rafters,
approximately 140 of them (people, not rafters).  The evening had a long
program with 19 speakers, but wrapped itself up in 2 hours and 15
minutes--it could have been a lot worse timewise.  Susan Thackrey, the MC,
was good at crowd management, announcing there would be no formal "break"
but encouraging people to get up, mill around, between readings, etc.

Here are some of the highlights . . .  a surprise visitor from Buffalo,
Robert Bertholf, opened the show detailing the latest finds of Duncaniana
and also updating us all on the plans to publish Duncan's "Collected Works"
(California) . . .  In honor of the doubling that runs throughout Duncan's
poetry, Jack and Adelle Foley read alternating lines and then
simultaneously poems by Duncan and Foley . . .  A seven minute excerpt from
Richard Moore's (1966?) NET Poetry USA Duncan documentary was shown, big,
blown up, only a little grainy and reddened across the edges, Duncan
reading "The Dance," etc in front of a mirror . . .   Aaron Shurin's
reading of "Passages 18: The Torso" was very crisp and clear and seductive
. . .  Readers were given five minutes apiece and many chose to read from
RD's own work . . . Surprising how many read from the two big last books of
"Ground Work," don't remember anyone reading from "The Opening of the
Field," but maybe this isn't surprising since many were Duncan's final
students from New College during the Ground Work years.  Thom Gunn read the
one about the cat, you could almost picture the cat creeping up and down
his leather jacket as he did so . . . .  Then there were some who
reminisced--Michael McClure a real pro, commanding and v. insightful; the
artist Fran Herndon spoke off the cuff about her earliest meetings with
Duncan and Jess in 1957, Stinson Beach, painting, etc.  One of the luckiest
breaks was that the photographer Harry Redl happened to be in town
(visiting from Vancouver) with some of his prints, and the black cotton
curtains were taped back from New College Theater's white walls, and a
selection of his photos were quickly hung before the show.  Redl was the
Viennese man about town in North Beach in 1957-1960, the photographer who
took the famous photos of poets for the Evergreen Review "San Francisco
Scene" issue of 1957.  He was introduced to the crowd by Michael Palmer but
alas did not speak.  The photos are amazing.  So it was a mass reading and
a vernissage all at the same time esp. nice for those who missed the
Whitney Beat Culture show where so many of Redl's works were shown.

Jerome Rothenberg (who read from "Seedings" his poem inspired by Duncan)
first met RD in 1950 or 1960, on his first day in San Francisco, RD took
him to a cafe, Harry Redl happened to take their picture, the picture
happened to be one HR had with him, the whole evening was filled with this
kind of serendipidity or "Inspiriting" as RD might have said . . .   David
Levi Strauss. returning to San Francisco after many many years away (and
afterwards remarking on how many streets and sights had changed) read
briefly, again from "Ground Work," great to see him again in the parlieus
of poetry . . .

Susan Howe was supposed to come but she was too ill to travel up from Palo
Alto (she's better now) and the rains kept away Barbara Guest.  One young
woman blanched visibly when told Howe was not there, a big pile of Howe's
books on her lap slipped.  Jess did not show up either but no one really
expected him to . . .  Duncan McNaughton read Yeats' "The Phases of the
Moon" replete with high drama, many many sips of water and a beautiful,
sonorous delivery, which  seemed to last forever, tho' it couldn't have
lasted more than 25 minutes, could it?

Kush was taping the whole event and will sell copies of the event (back
channel if anyone's interested) . . . In the spirit of things--in the
memorial spirit we are undergoing in San Francisco these days--under the
sign of Thanatos--he gave out copies of Ira Cohen's 1981 photo of Robert
Duncan massaging Kathy Acker's shoulders, a very touching portrait . . .
The unenviable task of last reader was saved for Michael Davidson, who gave
the most acclaimed reading of all, mostly a memoir of writing his
dissertation on RD, very funny, wry, ironic, reflexive, loving and tender,
enough to make RD's ghost flit in front of us, live, on stage, just for a
minute--

It's been pointed out on this list that Duncan made many an enemy, but the
Duncan who came through at this tribute was well-loved, in a way that
others can only aspire to.  His enormous influence on the poetry scene from
the Bay Area and beyond was palpable in the moisture-laden air.

       Thanks Lisa Samuels and Louis Cabri for excellent posts on
       Ms. (Riding) Jackson.
       I have some thoughts on the matter:
       A couple of questions for Louis.
       One) When you (LOuis) write: "to me (Lisa) you have recuperated
       what Riding's words worked for when they worked for poetry"
       I detect the deployment of an assumption (too common) I think
       needs to be challenged: that Riding Jackson RENOUNCED poetry.
       She may have renounced "poetry as such" (but in terms of
       RATIONAL MEANING, only insofar as poetry is a "name" and not
       a "word."). Perhaps, "working for poetry" is the problem and
       maybe one could understand Riding as asking:
       "ask not what words can do for poetry but what poetry can do
        for words" (sorry about the Lee Harvey Oswald quality here)--
       The way I see it, her later (post-poetry) writing, like THE
       TELLING (or "Engaging The Impossible", which in light of Ms.
       Samuel's remarks is especially worth considering--or even the
       Preface to the Selected Poems) can be seen as "working for poetry"
       or, MORE IMPORTANTLY, working AS poetry (if one is willing to
       consider a poetry not in the narrow "new critical" sense, or
       even perhaps the narrow 1998 sense), and Riding, even as
       (Riding) Jackson, seems to me to be more interested in critiquing
       the generic CRUTCH of poetry rather than poetry itself.
       It is the extreme endeavour of "space clearing" for the possibility
       of the "individual unreal" that I find almost everywhere in her
       work, the shucking off of the "baggage" of the "individual real"
       (which may be seen as the "expressive" self....).

        Two) 2). Louis, how does the word "unreal" "do and say more
                 than its cultural grammar at the time can support?"
                 What "cultural grammar" do you feel is necessary
                 to support her terminology or matrix? Does such
                 technology, lacking in 1928, exist now? And, if so,
                 for whom (and how do you know?)
                 By the way, I don't think she's posing a simple
                 "oppositional matrix" (real vs. unreal), because
                 it is complicated by the combination of another
                 simple oppositional matrix (collective vs. individual),
                 and one may notice that the "fourth term" (like the
                 "fourth wall" of "theatre") is conspiciously absent
                 (i.e. Ms. Samuels makes no mention of the possibility
                  of a "collective unreal"---perhaps because, for
                  Riding, the "individual unreal" IS one with "the
                  collective unreal").
Well, I would be curious to see if anybody wants to continue this.

  Happy Birthday, Bertolt!
    Does anybody know where one can find his specific mention of
    A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM, by the way, in his writing on theatre?

    2) and, if you haven't already, read his SONG OF THE CUT_PRICED
       POET (for the first third of the twentieth century when poetry
             was no longer paid for).
          this is your assignment
          (and maybe next year I'll be able to use the german word
            for alienation effect in an essay without always having
            to look it up). Chris

You might also look at Whitman's singular use of the word "disintegrated"
in Song of Myself.  It means, I think, "given an identity" (in the cosmos)
by being "de-integrated" - separated, precipitated-out, of the whole.
I think Whitmans's style is based on a balance between the particular,
the individual, and the whole - the balance gives it that "anonymous" character
which is one sign of real poetry... - Henry G.

   Henry, is it balance? or ambivalence? (tension)?
   "these are not the me myself"---
   a tension between the "self" which is REALLY an impersonal force
   (and the mistaking of this "impersonal force" for the "person" Walt
    Whitman may be why some call him megalomaniac)
    and the more brooding self that champions what Wordsworth would call
    obstinate questionings but is generally sad, desperate and pathetic
    (though these are not necessarily pejorative terms).
    Such is this dialectic, this unresolvable tension...
--------
    Since I've gotten into this 19th century groove (the class I'm
    teaching soon [adjunct salary toothless benefits]), I want to
    ask CAN ANYBODY SUGGEST A GOOD TRANSLATION EDITION OF GIACOMO
    LEOPARDI? I can't believe I haven't really read him before....
    he seemed more fashionable in the 1920s in the USA than in any
    time since. Any help would be appreciated. CHris

Time now for the trees to shroud the earth
with their dark branches, time
when the wind dies down

a faded voice is whispering.

Time again to climb into the old

and wind the iron spring:

it is letter by letter,
line by line.

Subject:      Poetry is not a subculture
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; CHARSET=US-ASCII

re Henry Gould's posting on 5th Feb re the task of crit,
particularly the upper case rant ending POETRY IS NOT A
SUBCULTURE

Firstly, whats so bad about being a subculture when the
dominant one is so banal, and in that banality so brutal
(check the current shituation viz Clinton & the UKs own
glorious ambassador of idiocy Blair)

Anyway, Henry's notes got me thinking about the marginal
position we often find ourselves in. It should be clear to
everybody that the way poetry is taught in school puts most
people off - these people aren't just 'outside' poetry, a
lot of them actively dislike it - seen as elitist and
irrelevent, the residue of a best forgotten culture that
existed pre-MTV etc, containing no joy fun or pleasure,
which are surely among the main reasons that we all got
involved in the first place. Result is, post-school a lot
of people are disinclined to go to poetry because it
carries too many school-time horror memories. Here in
Britain you  find undergraduates who still define a poem as
something that rhymes.

Fine, forget em, we're not in the business of mass markets
anyway, and maybe elitism isn't that bad after all, if the
alternative is such spectacles as the massed ranks of the
Tory Party singing Blake's lyrics as emblems of bigotry,
capital etc - all the stuff that Blake loathed.

It seems to me that people see poetry as a joke because
they don't know what it is; the most pleasure I've got from
my own readings is folks coming up afterwards saying they
usually hate poetry but loved mine (make of that what you
will!). A lot of people are THREATENED by the perceived
difficulties etc, and react accordingly.

It isn't a case of us learned poets against the philistine
world; its just that much of what we say only has interest
to each other, hence a discussion group like this. Example:
photographs of deep space engage me more than anything
else, but if someone in the pub starts talking about the
finer points of astro-physics my eyes glaze over.

Lets not forget that this is always the position that poets
have been in. Blake and Shelley were small press activists.
Its just now perhaps the situation is more complicated -
self consciousness produced by media etc etc. Sometimes in
the info-babble that we're all a part of it seems the only
possible option is an ironic silence (Rimbaud pissing in
the shadows) - but even thats useless, stand there silently
and no-one will notice, you'll just end up getting run over
by a truck.

I seldom stray off poetix here, and when I do it's for the sake of
politix.

But country blues is a major passion of mine, so in the wake of several
mentions of Robert Johnson, let me just drop this...

Possibly 5,000 tracks of interest were recorded between 1927 and 1940,
that could be called country blues or closely-allied urban blues, such as
boogie piano and piano-based blues vocals.  The extent to which Johnson is
the only artist people've heard of, is frightening.  A whole lot of this
stuff is available on reissues.  Just to name the darker more brooding
types, who'd appeal to Johnsonites, check out most anything by:

Barbacue Bob
Blind Willie McTell
Charlie Lincoln (typically chauvinist, I start with Atlanta artists)
Peg Leg Howell
Charley Patton
Tommy Johnson
Bukka White
Memphis Minnie
Peetie Wheatstraw
Sleepy John Estes
Son House
Henry Thomas
Blind Lemon Jefferson


This list suggests a couple of things, of course: country blues was
dominated by men, women having strongly dominated the
jazz/vaudeville-related "composed" blues of 1919-1929, typified by Bessie
Smith and producer/bandleader/composers like Handy.  (Much beyond Smith is
worth listening to in that genre also, by the way)  Nonetheless, Memphis
Minnie, with hundreds of 78s to her name, was a truly dominant figure,
the most imaginative of blues songwriters and famous for the brilliance of
her guitar work. (Her three successive husbands were all major blues
singer/guitarists, and were always her prime collaborators in person and
on record; but it was always quite clear that she was the prime artist.)

Second, this list mostly excludes trends outside the "deep blues".. Such
as East Coast and much of Texas and Memphis and "Bluebird beat" and jug
bands.  Most of those trends are more uptempo and "good-timey" and that
puts off some blues fans I know.  But in my opinion they represent some of
the best pop music ever produced in the US or anywhere else, with formal
range and fascinating lyrics replacing pure somberness.  Not to mention
*energy* (Peter Guralnick writes accurately that the great jug bands were
"the rock and roll bands of their time," and the parallel is quite exact
for conveying the kind of rush they provide.)

Third, how can a poet resist a genre where making up your nom du disque
was itself to compose a sort of mini-poem??  (see list above)

(There were lots more women in country blues besides Minnie, by the way,
but unfortunately most only had one or two 78s released, and so you need
to seek 'em out on various muti-artist compilations.)

Claude Pélieu & Mary Beach are well and alive in upstate New york (well,
Claude is a bit the worse for the wear; Mary, closing in on eighty is
doing wonderfully -- making collages every day -- both are in fact the
last great collage-artists of the age). Claude has done mainly visual
work in the last few years (many hundreds of collages, even though
arthritis in the hands is making the scissor work difficult), though
there is also a fair amount of writing writing: I am editing a Selected
Pelieu right now. A number of small press books have come out in France
these last 10 years. Obviously, last year's disappearance of AG & WSB
hit them hard.

44 was the uniform number chosen by Henry Aaron, Willie McCovey and Reggie
Jackson (the latter two in homage to the first), none of whom ever played in
Japan a la Cecil Fielder, Don Blasingame or other US baseball players trying
to stretch out or pump up stalled careers (fewer players have followed the
path of Warren Spahn and George Brunet (who pitched until he was nearly 50)
by going to Mexico instead). I forget what Spahnie's number was, although I
did see him pitch once as an SF Giant (this was before Mexico) in addition
to many times in a Milwaukee uniform. Still, my favorite post-US-major
league event remains Louis Tiant's stint in the short-lived Senior Baseball
League where he was traded from one team in Florida to another in return for
500 stuffed teddy bears.

I have too many friends who are Freudian analysts to treat as casually as
I've seen here, although its problematics could take a generation of careers
to fully explore. One thing that the Freudians did which has had a huge
impact in the US was to keep certification away from the university system
as such (Dale Smith would approve) by setting up their own institutes. One
thing this did was guarantee that there was no professor on campus who was
ever the "official" Freudian in the psych department, which in turn meant
that anybody in any department could volunteer for that social role,
including, back when I was a student at UC Berkeley, Freddy Crews, a shallow
opportunist who was widely regarded as in the sweepstakes for most boring
professor in the department (Mark Schorer and Tom Parkinson competed as well
and I always thought that Schorer won out simply because he'd had a 20 year
head start on Crews and 10 on Parkinson) -- Crews used to teach a literature
and ideology course that was a tribute to predictability and certainly never
thought to try reading "unideological" texts in those terms. Anyhow,
Freudianism as an ism became both a free floating signifier of the worst
sort on every campus AND has become, as a formal system among professional
analysts who are painfully aware of their outsiderness to the university
system, fairly defensive. It's a system in which trying to think clearly or
even halfway intelligibly about Freud's limits (as well as strengths) is all
but impossible, though I am sure that there are careers to be made in the
trying. Rethinking Marx is not dissimilar as a project beset with problems
at the moment, as in The Work of Art in the Age of Hypertext etc.

But I think the real lesson to be drawn from the Freudian adventure in the
US has been what it's revealed about how universities function when a major
trend in social analysis (and you never had to agree with any of Freud to
see it was at least that) is set loose under those special terms.

That's why I think it's so important that we stress, over and over, that the
legitimation of poetry is something that occurs OFF campus, typically in the
major urban areas but inevitably not in the MFA programs or the various
anglophile critical programs (the latter these days falling all over
themselves to tell us just how fab fab fabulous the new Ted Hughes'
collection of necromancy is).

Louis, thanks for the exact details re the Archives and the list -- I think
that tends to point out the nature of the discourse here rather well. As
I've said before, if there are 500 folks "subscribed" and a max of 50
messages possible per day, people should think very hard before posting more
than one.

dear chris & louis,

yes, it's right to set aside the notion of an oppositional matrix, or
at least binary, between "real" and "unreal".  i'd say riding wants
"collective-real" and "individual-real" to tango or tangle together so
that "individual-unreal" can have the rest of the thought space.  she
performed a similar operation with "become" and "becoming", setting
them alongside or opposite each other so that they could struggle
publicly while the more important fact of "UNBECOMING" might be
what individual-unreal selves were striving toward.

while i have not seen an exact predecessor for "individual-unreal",
louis, such terms were being used by an assortment of such
odd contemporaries as wyndham lewis, in the context
of coming up with vocabularies to fight "the historical sense" and
the individual in the queue of tradition, etc.  riding explicitly
addresses (& disapproves of) lewis, still caught in the "real"
according to her.

i think your formulation of asking what poetry can do for words is a
good one, chris -- and what it can do for humans, of course, too, in
their efforts to be perfectly understood for and by one another.
looking straight into the eye of the impossible.  odd that she always
reminds me of kathy acker's way of putting it, given how riding would
disapprove of this: "the demand for an adequate mode of expression is
senseless."  nothing is enough.

And they are still alive.  Being baseball immortals, I suppose they will
ever die.  At least their numbers won't.

While in this non sequitorial realm--here is my favorite baseball poem:

Gertrude Stein on the designated hitter (I don't think she likes it, but
I am not sure) and other baseball stuff
(Stanzas in Meditation, #IX)

How nine
Nine is not mine
Mine is not nine
Ten is not nine
Mine is not ten
Nor when
Nor which one then
Can be not then
Not only mine for ten
But any ten for which one then
I am not nine
Can be mine
Mine one at a time
Not one from nine
Nor eight at one time
For which they can be mine.
Mine is one time
As much as they know they like
I like it too to be one of one two
One two or one or two
One and one
One mine
Not one mine
As so they ask me what I do
Can they but if they too
One is mine too
Which is one for you
Can they be like me
I like it for which they can
Not pay but say
She is not mine with not
But will they rather
Oh yes not rather not
In won in mine in three
In one two three
All out but me.
I find I like what I have
Very much.

As per Ron, I have thought hard, and am posting my second message of the
day....

I strongly recommend -ocracy: parts 1-4 by Peter Ganick and Sheila Murphy
(Norman OK : Texture Press, 1997).

This has been my favorite rush-hour reading for the past few days.  Its
swoop and verve and pointed changes of image-center keep me rivited, and
make bus-commuting fade into the background.  It'll be too paratactic for
some of our commonsensepods; but this is really fine writing and fun
writing.  It's verse, which mutates its grain and tempo between sections;
kinda like the traditional approach to different tempi between movements
of a classical piece. (..but not as drear and plodding in execution as the
sleepy Possum) The center shifts relentlessly like Ron himself; but less
social surface and more of the roil and smoke underlying awareness, the
tumult of how awareness clashes with our violently disunified culture.
Not enuff center?? Imitative form notwithstanding, scattershot effect
(scattershot intention?) would be the main fault in the piece.

It sounds great read aloud and is pretty funny too.  Barbara Hocker's
minimalist cover art is appropriate and amusing as well.....

        On country blues, American folk music, the best place to begin, I
think, is with "Before the Blues" vol.s I - III, on the yazoo label.  I
happen to work in a c.d. shop which specializes in these genres, so let me
know if I can help.  Also, "American Primitive" on the Reverent label.
That is, raw gospel 78's.

Well, no this isn't that necessary "a place to begin.." You can really
begin anywhere, depending on what type of blues you lean toward...It is
not a genre that needs a detailed introduction

However, Yazoo is the premiere label for reissues.  For completeness,
there are now dozens of specialty labels, many of 'em excellent, like
Blues Classics, Document etc.  These can't be found in many stores.  The
best way to find out about them is to get on the mailing list of an
outfit called Roots & Rhythms (details on demand); unless of course you
live in Boston, then you can mosey over to Cheapo Records in Central
Square, like generations before you.

You can also use a local bookstore or library to read the detailed
essay/notations in the Blackwell Guide to Blues Records; I have the first
edition, edited by the dean of blues scholars, Paul Oliver.  A brand new
2nd edition is just out and I can't vouch for it as I haven't seen it, but
it's probably just as solid.

Well, I did seek forgiveness...  But the difference is that I said nothing
in my magazine against anyone.  All dialogue comes from each person's own
mouth.  My editorial concern was to represent a single thread that took
place re the editorial practice of Mike and Dale's.  As I stated in my intro
I wanted to broaden the audience for this extremely lively group of exchanges.

By the way, my new email account doesn't give individual names with each
post.  I only know for sure who is writing when the post is signed.  But I
have a feeling, due to his brilliant ability to sniff out thin contradictions
and to gauge levels of honesty, that I am replying to Aldon Nielson.  Well,
I'm glad you're interested in the magazine.  If you, David Bromige, Susan Schul
tz, Hugh Steinberg, Simon Schuchat, Maria Damon, Robert Drake, Mark Weiss,
Sylvester Pollet and Eliza McGrand will backchannel me with your addresses
I'll be sure to send one off to you (send $5 and I'll put you on the list for
#8!).  *Honestly* it's a very interesting exchange.  I've already sent
copies to Dodie, Kevin and Juliana.  Thanks for staying on me though to
get these out to the others.

The idea that Dale "pirated" material by printing e-mails in the
feisty Mike and Dale's Younger Poets from a list discussion relating
to _that same magazine and its editorial policy_ strikes me as a bit
ridiculous. Obviously, if these had been private communications Dale
would have needed permission to reprint, but anything that appears
here is already freely available to millions and should just be
thought of as in the public domain. Why not? If Dale did something
wrong by doing what he did then so did Postmodern Culture when it
reprinted posts of a rather "personal" nature from the
discussion here after Allen Ginsberg's death. Some of my own words
are in there and nobody contacted me-- should I consider calling the
lawyers?

any number of issues seem to have gotten mixed together oddly in Kent's
post -- I'm headed back into the arms of El Nino, so only have time for a
few quick takes --

1) Did Postmodern culture in fact reprint entire posts from the list?  I
haven't seen that issue, so don't know.  This has nothing to do with
calling lawyers, but if they did, they should not have.  What I did see was
a review article in which some posts were quoted, but perhaps that was a
different issue?  Could you give me the number so I can try to see it at
their site?

2) The POETICS list is available to "millions" only in the strictest sense,
since the "millions" would either have to subscribe or hack into it --

3) In either event, this has nothing to do, so far as I can see, with the
question of whether or not somebody has the right to print pages of POETICS
list discussion in their magazine with neither permission nor notice.  The
fact that some of the posts were about the magazine's editorial policy has
nothing to do with it -- the fact that Kent writes a post here about the
policy of Postmodern Culture in reprinting Poetics list posts would not
authorize them to reprint his post --

and forgetting numbering --

as I've said here any number of times -- I assume that anything I post to
the list MAY reappear somewhere else -- I assume this because of what I
know of human nature, and because it has already happened in the past --
That does not mean that it is OK for anybody who wants to, at any time, in
any place, to republish such posts --

Is it really that ridiculous to ask that somebody who plans to reprint
posts from this list should at least notify the writers and provide copies?

and let me make it clear, since I imagine most on the list haven't seen
Dale's mag., this is not a personal complaint -- from what I saw in the
copy that was shown to me briefly in SF there are few of my words in there
-- but the episode has a bad smell to me -- The "list owner" has pretty
much had a hands off policy towards what goes on here, and that's one of
the things that has made the list what it is -- and I'm not asking that
anybody be kicked out, or that anybody be told to shut up, or that anything
official be done by anybody -- I AM asking that we respect one another
enough to act in such a way that all will continue to feel that they can
speak freely in this environment

was going to get to the sublime, but I see my car floating away -- so I
will float after it --

I think Spahn was 21.  He aslo is in one of the most famous baseball
poems, "Spahn and Sain, and two days rain." - although it might be
forgotten now.  If there is a run on Brave (Milw) numerology, what
were the numbers of Burdette, Buhl. Crandell, Bruton,....?

Lisa & Chris,

"ask not what words can do for poetry but what poetry can
do for words"?
Caesar is exactly the problem. Is it the problem with all the
late Riding? I haven't read the just-published _Rational
Meaning_ yet, so I'm going on, say, _The Telling_ when I
think that it is.

What is this imperial "word" of truth in 'late Riding'?

It's not the same "word," for me, as when, in her earlier
critical prose even, she uses "individual-real" & other terms
(1928).

It's not the genre status of her late writing, Chris, that is the
issue for me but exactly this changed set toward the word.

Lisa, I agree: she's going *beyond* oppositional matrices
(that's what I meant, Chris) with some of those early words.
These are the rational matrices in relation to which most terms
establish their common value. I'm saying "individual-unreal"
becomes virtually a neologism. It's beyond the usual
understanding of "unreal" that is got from thinking of "real."
She has an inadequate vocabulary at hand *but* it's not her
fault - it's the cultural grammar of her time and she is
impatiently pushing elements of it to their limits in order to
attempt to exceed the given, outrageously inadequate
meanings in circulation (anarchism is NOT enough, as Lisa
says).

To the extent that she goes "beyond," her prose is "poetic"
-- but so what, really. I don't see what the word "poetic"
adds or takes away to the event. But saying this is not
asking "what poetry can do for words," which is a different
trajectory on the word entirely.

Maybe the fourth possibility ("collective-unreal"), insofar as
it might have a negative spin for her (very likely, no?), is
what she calls the "zeitgeist" in her long first essay in
_Contemporaries & Snobs_.

I'm interested in objectifying rules. That's not the same as
ruling objectively. And it's definitely not subjectifying rules.
I think when Riding goes metaphysical at the end there, in
_The Telling_ in particular, she's subjectifying rules (despite
all her objectivity) in order to rule objectively.

Subjectifying rules - which leads back to singularity. I don't
know about the *words* of a "philosophy," an "equipment
for living," of the singular. I don't know if I like to work
toward that way. I know I don't, in fact. Because Riding is
substituting one "generic CRUTCH," as you put it, Chris,
poetry, for another, philosophical prose. Trying to 'tie it all
together' in discursive philosophical prose. Mistake! Poetry
is not The Concept, but it can simulate it perfectly well, so
why not do that?

Nor do I think all poetry should be singular, as if it were an
ideal *value* or condition beyond history (so I reject
someone's [not you, Chris or Lisa] constant invocation -- in
a Turtlewax Antique-Charm Polish & homsespun proverbial
vernacular of the staid backwoodsman, whose profile's no
problem if you're walking passed it by the log cabin display
on the lawn outside the Howard Johnson's, but *month after
month of living in the cabin* is like your screen freezing on
Hokey Hill in a virtual world of Disney -- of a universal
standard that you apparently find in all good poetry, viz:
"the impersonal." The personal is really impersonal? Not my
conclusion, anyway.) In fact I don't think you are saying this
at all, Lisa - that rather it's a finding your way, whatever
means, into the contingent historical present in all its
absolute impossibility.

"The demand for an adequate mode of expression is
senseless." I can see, Lisa,  how you mean that to refer to
Riding. However, if that is read as Riding, then sense itself
is not adequately undermined by being brought beyond its
limit, as in her early work, because what's happened instead
is that the limit - rationality - has become a site of semantic
investment, & arbiter of the truthful word. That's how I feel
about her later stuff.

I want to read the dictionary book; hopefully will find time this summer.

I don't think so, Kent.  After all, many people post poems on this
list, and I hardly think that means they are giving up their copyright.
Quoting from posts on this list might fall under the "Fair Use" rules,
but reproduction of a series of posts in their entirety certainly
violates copyright.  Because one chooses to publish in a venue that
allows millions of folks to see one's work doesn't mean one gives up
all right to choose *which* venue will publish one's work. (In your terms
any author of a bestseller would lose the right to control reprints.)

What it comes down to *should* be courtesy, even before we begin
discussing the issue of legality.  On another list, long ago, I heard
that quite a bit of my writing had been lifted and reprinted in hard
copy, by authors who never asked me if I minded my work being
reproduced in journal form.  (Joe surely remembers the "Alex" incident
on the old Technoculture list.) I did not *like* the author of the piece
that lifted my work, and I'd have denied him the opportunity to reprint
my posts on those grounds.  That's my right. I'm the author; I own the
copyright, I get to say who publishes my stuff, outside of quotations
extracted under Fair Use.

Yes, PMC was wrong, too, if they didn't contact you first, though it's,
of course, your choice to call a lawyer or to let it go.  Just because
a practice has become ubiquitous doesn't make it ethical. And I'm
surprised that Dale is able to rationalize publishing those pieces simply
because they talk about "his" journal.  Hell, even if somebody writes a
bad review of my book, I still don't own the rights to go around reproducing
the review in my publications.

This is a pretty cut-and-dried matter.  There are lots of sites which
discuss copyright in e-space, and I doubt one of them will say that what
Dale did was okay, either ethically or legally, however justified he may
feel.

All posts made to the list are available to anyone with a Web browser right
here:

<http://listserv.acsu.buffalo.edu/archives/poetics.html>

& have been for a very long time.  Anyone can read it at any time
regardless of the so-called closed status of the list.  This is mentioned
in the Welcome Message that's often posted to the list & that I'm sure
we've all read before saving to our hard drives.

Certainly (if we're to claim this is some kind of community) it makes sense
for folks on the list to ask others if it's okay to quote them, but being
outside of the academic world I don't know the protocol of the need to do
so.

Such need is less clear for those who stumble or otherwise come across the
archives and search for information relevant to something they're writing
about.  For such purposes, the archive is just another resource out there.
While it might be nice if they were to do so, I doubt that everyone who
finds a useful quote in, say, your book Black Chant will ask your
permission before adding it to their term paper or thesis.

I've seen a few footnoted citations of posts to the list (Perloff on
Yasusada, Altieri on BlaserCon), I imagine there've been others, the PMC
article I guess being one of them.

Since Dale's offered to provide copies for those whose words are reprinted,
I think the problem's now the more abstract one of a realizing that every
word written here is published on the Web.

Good luck with your floating car.

Bests,

Louis, could you clarify for us the argument of that "someone" you're
planting satirical sides of shrubbery around?  "Someone" argued once that
the process of writing poetry sometimes involves individual effort - even
an effort to excel, differentiate from the rest, find a unique voice,
perhaps even beat the rest at their own game - which complicates the
"group solidarity" so cherished by those who want to "make a difference",
and needs to be taken into account when encountering poetry.  "Someone"
argued that some critics might see poetry as an art of words - words wrought
to their most complicated - and that these critics might be able to
"see" better if they are free from extra-literary allegiances, and write better
if they share the poet's own drive for uniqueness.  "Someone" argued once
(in a much earlier thread) that great poetry exhibits an anonymous objective
quality - the poet breaking through the shell of individuality, exceeding
personal limits.  Now you are saying this same "someone" was therefore
arguing that poetry was a "value" beyond history?  I think you're pinning
"someone" with an argument they never made. But as long as you don't
name that "someone", Louis, you can keep talking only to Lisa -
and "someone" won't call you on it & disprove you. You may think a certain
poetry club-du-jour is actually "changing history" by transvaluing
literary values; you are welcome to your belief.  "Someone" will wait
to see what the indie-critics make of it - as poetry.
- Henry Gould, the one & only "someone"

Hello, Joel, Nick, & others:

Thanks everyone who backchanneled & Nick, for your post. Also, thanks to
everyone who posted various Eastern-filtered readings of 44. I'll post an
"official" call for work on Dan's life & art in the next couple of days.

As per Joel's request, what follows is a list of some of Daniel Davidson's
work. I'll start with _culture_, listing the books that make up that longpoem,
in the sequence Dan had planned for them. Following that are lists of all
published books and all works published in magazines through 1991. I've been
sick for several days plus had to move from the Bronx to Manhattan, and then
from Manhattan to Brooklyn, so what follows is by no means complete. It
hopefully gives you a lot to look for until I've put together a more complete
list, which I'll probably send to the EPC rather than posting (& post to say
it's there.) (Joel: see, esp., his review of Collobert's _It Then_--I seem to
remember you mentioning w/interest Collobert's work.)

Aldon: I agree with everything below. Dale's wrist has been properly

Maria, you've probably got this by now, but: "The Song of the Borderguard"
was published in _A Book of Resemblances_ and appears again in _Selected
Poems_, ed. Robert J. Bertholf(New York: New Directions, 1993), pages 22-3.
I don't know if the page reference changes for the revised edition of the
Selected.

Cheers,
David

last Thursday at Loyola Marymount University an unexpectedly huge crowd
turned out for a reading by Juan Felipe Herrera -- hit of the evening was a
poem titled "Foodstuffs They never Told Us About" -- a poem whose origins
were Herrera's long-term desire to use the word "foodstuffs" in a poem.

Herrera read mostly from a new manuscript titled "Don't Worry, Baby."
Random lines transcribed from the title poem:


I worry about exotic birds learning too much English.
I worry about the Governor's face muscles.
I worry about the return of folk singers.
I worry about people who use the word "folk."
I worry about Spielburg's next ethnic movie.
I worry about drive-by's low on gas.
I worry about Beijing doing Elvis.
I worry about Russian women becoming rednecks.
I worry about poets who believe in publishing.
I worry about the word "alien" becoming too familiar.
I worry about the ass on the other side of the glass ceiling.
I worry about performance art going into the poetry business.
I worry about copycat do-gooders.
I worry about insurance agents posing as poets.
I worry about the complexion of beans.
I worry about VFW halls that have Taco Thursdays.
I worry about rappers entering a spelling bee.
I worry about guys locked up so they can write.



Herrera'a new book of prose, _Mayan Drifter_, is out from Temple University
Press.


next up here -- David Bromige and Michael Davidson.  Will announce date and
time in a few weeks.

Just as a point of information: the material from Poetics that is reprinted
in the PMC piece in question consists of a very brief posting from Charles
Bernstein announcing Allen Ginsberg's illness, and then (about) six lines of
the renga authored by various members of this list. Alhough I understand how
one could argue that a principle is what's at stake in the juxtaposition
with Dale Smith's actions, any real comparison between the two seems
overstated to me. Matt

I'm always reachable backchannel. Will be off for awhile, at least til end
of April. I'll send, via another subscriber, info on upcoming PhillyTalks
etc.

Thanks many of you for exciting discussions; good luck weathering more
of them!

By "Polish" in my last post I only meant polish (i.e. for the Turtlewax).
I regret the line "The Trees!" if Maria felt impinged.

Sheila Watson, Canada's best ever fiction writer, died last week, age 88.
She was bpNichol's favourite. He made it to 44, and as he was born in '44,
died in '88.

He never carried a smokeless revolver, or drove an Oldsmobile, though.

It's not a nonsense word at all. It's built-in and is "yon." "Yon" means
four, just like "shi" does. I just haven't heard anything else - but then
I'm in Fukuoka, in the south-west.

  Scott -- here's the page (or 2 re the tranlation of "désoeuvrement") --
Pierre:


from : Preface to Maurice Blanchot’s THE UNAVOWABLE COMMUNITY
(Station Hill Press 1988)

....
 The term that has caused the greatest problems [in translation] is without
a doubt désoeuvrement,  and its derivate, désoeuvrée,  which appears in the
title of Nancy's essay, but is very much a Blanchot word. The word has at
its core the concept of the "oeuvre" (work, body of work, artistic work,
etc.) and implies a range of meanings: idleness, a state of being without
work, unoccu pied, etc. After various attempts of maintaining this semantic
range (and considering keeping Lydia Davis' early rendering of the word as
"worklessness"), I decided to use the term "the unworking" — first suggested
to me by Christopher Fynsk. It is a key term in Blanchot's thinking and it
would be useful here to quote certain relevant passages from both Blanchot
and Nancy.

 The word appears in its common meaning of "idle, at loose ends, finding
oneself with nothing to do, etc." in Blanchot's fiction as far back as the
1952 book Celui qui ne m'accompagnait pas  ; but even here already the
author playfully worries the word, making it yield a one-page medita tion on
its meaning and excavating in the process the core-sème "oeuvre":

  Though I did not feel tired, I was disoriented and prodigiously idle
(désoeuvré ); this idleness (désoeuvrement ) was also my task, it kept me
busy: maybe it represented a lull (un temps mort ), a moment of giving up
and of blacking out on the part of the watcher, a weakness that forced me to
be myself all alone. But the empty chur ning I was caught in had to have
another meaning, evoking hunger, evoking the need to wander, to go further,
while asking "Why did I come in here? Am I looking for something?", though
maybe I was not looking for anything and maybe further on was yet again the
same as right here. That much I knew. To know was part of that solitude,
cre ated that solitude, was at work (à l'oeuvre ) in that idleness
(désoeuvrement ), closing off the exits. Out of idleness I asked him....."

  The full philosophical and literary complexity of the term is worked out
later, most fully in the1969 essay, "The Absence of the Book" (cf. The Gaze
of Orpheus , pp.145 -160) where Blanchot writes:

 To write is to produce absence of the work (worklessness) [désoeuvrement ].
Or: writing is the absence of the work as it produces itself  through the
work and throughout the work. Writing as worklessness (in the active sense
of the word) is the insane game, the indeterminacy that lies between reason
and unreason.
 What happens to the book during this "game", in which workless ness is set
loose during the operation of writing? The book: the pas sage of an infinite
movement, a movement that goes from writing as an operation to writing as
worklessness; a passage that immediately impedes. Writing passes through the
book, but the book is not that to which it is destined (its des tiny).
Writing passes through the book, completing itself there even as it
dis appears in the book; and yet, we do not write for the book. The book: a
ruse by which writing goes to wards the absence of the book.

 It is exactly that little parenthesis, "(in the active sense of the word),"
that is problematic in the translation of the term désoeuvrement  with the
passive worklessness. (There may be a radical cultural difference at work
here: the puritan impulses of Anglo-American culture blocking the very
possibility of a positive, active connotation to be attached to the notion
of an absence of work?)

 All of Nancy's essay builds up to a point, two-thirds of the way through,
where the word "désoeuvrée", announced in the title in relation to
community, finally gets stated. It comes after a critique of the Cartesian
im manentist subject, seen by  Nancy as "the inverted figure of the
experience of community":

 That is why the community cannot come within the province of the work
[l'oeuvre]. One does not produce it, one experiences it as the ex perience
of finitude (or: its experience makes us). The community as work, or the
community through works, would presuppose that the common being, as such, is
objectifiable and producible ( in places, per sons, edifices, discourses,
institutions, symbols: in short, in subjects). The products of operations of
that type, no matter how grandiose they want, and sometimes manage, to be,
never have more communitarian existence than the plaster torsos of Marianne.

 The community takes place of necessity in what Blanchot has called the
unworking [désoeuvrement ]. Before or beyond the work, it is that which
withdraws from the work, that which no longer has to do with production, nor
with completion, but which encounters interrup tion, fragmentation,
suspension. The community is made of the inter ruption of the singularities,
or of the suspension singular beingsare. It is not their work, and it does
not have them as its works, not anymore than communication is a work, nor
even an operation by singular beings: for it is simply their being - their
being in suspension at its limit. Communication is the unworking of the
social, economic, techni cal, in stitutional work .

 After its long incubation in Blanchot's fictions and essays, after Nancy's
book and Blanchot's response to it, le désoeuvrement , "the un working" is
clearly emerging as one of the most centrally active concepts of
contemporary thought not only in relation to the work of writing, but also —
as Nancy's last sentence makes clear — in relation to a wide array of other
concerns. The necessary tentativeness in the translation of the term is, in
a way, proof of the concept's very vitality, that is to say, its active
complexity.



1 To be published shortly in a translation by Lydia Davis under the title
"The One Who Was Standing Apart From Me" by Station Hill Press. The
occurrence of désoeuvrement  I am referring to can be found on page 70 of
the French edition. Clearly, translating désoeuvrement  with the
literary/philosophical term "the unworking" would  not work in this
narra tive context. The translation here is mine.


2 Again, in French the word désoeuvrement  as used in the last sentence
implies an active sense the English word "worklessness" does not convey.
Another Blanchot translator, Ann Smock, uses the word "uneventfulness" to
translate désoeuvrement. In a footnote to her translation of L'Ecriture du
Désastre, (University of Nebraska Press, 1986) she writes:

"The uneventfulness of the neutral wherein the lines not traced retreat" is
my elaboration upon Blanchot's expression "le désoeuvrement du neutre".  Le
dé soeuvrement is a word Blanchot has long used in close association with
l'oeuvre (the work of art, of literature). It means the work as the work's
lack ? the work as unmindful of being or not being, as neither present nor
absent: neutral. It also means idleness, inertia. My word "uneventfulness"
tries to express this idea of inaction, of nothing's happening, and my
additional phrase "the lines not traced retreat," recalling an earlier
expression in this book, "the retreat of what never has been treated", seeks
to retain the relation which this fragment is evoking and which is, so to
speak, spelled out in the word désoeuvrement: the relation between the work
and its denial. Between writing and passivity, be tween being and not being
a writer, being and not being the subject of the verb "to write."

 Although I would agree in the main with her understanding of the concept of
désoeuvrement, I cannot comprehend why she feels it necessary to add at this
point the phrase "the lines not traced retreat", which seems like a gross
translator's inter ference with the Blanchot text. I can only suggest that
she must have felt uneasy with her translation of désoeuvrement  as
"uneventfulness", and therefore wants to "explain" the term further.
Clearly, "uneventfulness" does carry some of the meaning of the french word,
though she loses the notion of the "oeuvre", the work.

Oh dear, now I've gone and driven Louis Cabri off the list.  Add this to
my list of crimes, Ron Silliman.  I wanted to say to Louis that IF he's
saying I argued poetry was "above" history, he's right, I did, and I'm wrong
to deny it.  I see I contradicted myself (above) yesterday & have had to
rethink this.  I don't think poetry's above history, I think that poetry is
more expressive of the history it's in than "history" does or talking-
historically-ABOUT-poetry does.  For a long time, in the academy, theory
had the upper hand over poetry itself.  Scholars weren't that interested in
the poems per se but in the material influences & historical conditions
informing them.  Steve Evans's "Change" essay maybe culminates & overturns
this trend: he says, in effect, "history with regard to poetry is a sort of
in-between, incipient-decadent, TIME OF WAITING in which only the agents
themselves (the poets) have the vaguest notion what they are saying-doing
(and even they feel conflicted & confused about this)"[MY paraphrase].
Rod Smith's title of his book IN MEMORY OF MY THEORIES is apropos here.

We talk at cross purposes, we get into arguments, because we all have
different things we want to talk about.  I find the argument that "our
poetry is above criticism because it's part of a historical trend that
renders criticism obsolete" to be a specious way to justify anything -
lack of talent, non-literary motivations, anything.  A new artistic
development will indeed overturn (temporarily) past "standards" - but
criticism - via good indie-critics - has a way of gradually responding
to change - on its own aesthetic terms.  I'm not saying the process
is perfect or even very sensible.   But I will say that in the battle between
theory and poetry, or poetry and talking-about-poetry (and there is such
a battle) a recognition that poetry "makes its history" on its own terms
(the terms of poetry) might be a way to see through a lot of promotional
or purely academic "talk about".  Do I want to silence "talk about"?
Not at all.  The academics & critics who "see" motives & meanings in
poems - historical, political, etc. - are irreplaceable.  But when
it gets to the point that "someone" like me has to defend the mere
existence of an "individual agent" in the process of making poems,
then maybe "something" is missing in all the "talk-about".

I hope Louis Cabri will rejoin this list.

I concur. Henry's heteronymic prolixity was at least one reason the list
has been so all-fired hot these past few weeks. Wasn't it just a month
ago people were complaining about how dull it was? As for those who
choose not to post, let them croak undisturbed in the swamp.

I dont have ron's email infront a me anymore, but Ive a different desire
with this list, with spending time with the energetic presence different
voices project outward here.  so Im thanksful for a rush of henry
spandrift blarnesian crackerbox collectibles, I relish it when there's a
stepping forward to say what you gotta say.  & I dont believe that the
50 a day limit is throttling any voice that wants to pump it up, as all
messages go in queue, & theoretically we could get a very interesting
poetics list timewarp going, if we were all now reading & responding to
messages from 3 days or 3 weeks or 3 years ago,  does it really
matter....

All this talk about the various associations of the word for the number 4 in
East Asian languages has led me to ask (of any Chinese historians/linguists
out there): was the name "Gang of Four" intended to mean something in
addition to the four Chinese accused of various crimes and conspiracies
against Mao during the Cultural Revolution?

Subject:      Why I'm not an experimental poet
Comments: To: poetics@UBVM.cc.buffalo.edu

Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

Reading Crayon's festschrift for Jackson Mac Low of late (a really great job
in every department), I was intrigued at Mordecai Mac Low's discussion of
his father's work as an instance of scientific methodology in process, since
Mordecai is in particular position to know whereof he speaks on this topic.

I still feel profoundly uncomfortable with the idea of the "experimental"
tho, what with its sense that "this may not work" and the "trial and error"
sense of process. But today I've discovered a deeper reason why I'm not an
experimental poet.

West Chester University's 4th annual summer writers conference (June 10-13)
focuses this year on "Exploring Form & Narrative" and offers a workshop on
"Experimental Forms" taught by...Dana Gioia.

I'm not making this up.

Some of the other sessions to be taught: Meter (Timothy Steele), Rhyme
(Charles Martin), the Sonnet (RS Gwynn), French Forms (Phillis Levin) and
Blank Verse (Alfred Corn). There is also an "Introduction to Form" taught by
Cynthia Zarin who, as the brochure says, has work that "appears frequently
in The New Yorker."

There will also be a "celebration" of the Hudson Review (Louis Simpson,
Daniel Hoffman, Frederick Morgan etc) and there's a call for critical papers
on the poetry of Amy Clampitt, Literary Quarterlies, Translation and
"individual authors or subjects relevant to the conference theme."

More details including scholarship info at:
www.wcupa.edu\_ACADEMICS\sch_cas\poetry\

Cost ranges between $250-499 for the whole shebang, which includes a picnic
and dance.

Now, I'm perfectly willing to concede that one could get real value from
some of the sessions (Marilyn Nelson is teaching a master class, for
example), but the idea that this claustrophobic convocation on pattern
represents the idea of "form" insults my intelligence as it should that of
any poet born after Baudelaire and Blake. That it is being held at a state
institution borders on theft of public resources.

So that is why I am not an experimental poet.

Nice, George! The first verse is not forgotten, true, but wasn't it

"Spahn and Sain and PRAY for rain"? -- the reference being, of course,
to the team having little chance to win without those two on the mound?
Later bastardized by the California (it figures, right?) Angels with
"Tanana and Ryan and then start cryin' ". Pitchers and catchers report
this weekend . . .

On another note, thanks to Katy Lederer for posting a section from
Foucault's only truly valuable work for my poetics, _The Order of
Things_ (but what do I know, I like Baudrillard too, even his little
masterpiece of invective _Forget Foucault__). But I'd like to ask Katy
(and anyone else who has ventured through the formidable prose of this
work), what she thinks of the period he deals with BEFORE the dead-end
of the 16th century, namely the pre-Renaissance system of order and
meaning, when things were luminous and so were their signs? For me, John
Dee and Ficino and Pico (see, in another context, Don Byrd's recent post
about neo-Platonism) always existed as alternatives to late 20th-century
semiotics -- even though my pal Duncan McNaughton lectured me lately
that nothing was ever truly lost. So for me it's Giordano Bruno, si --
Derrida, no!

Happy to be 44 years old until a couple of days ago . . .

The bad-boy angel sometimes named Satan (the nephew of that other Satan)
is called No. 44 in Mark Twain's "Mysterious Stranger" manuscripts.
Perhaps Twain was on to something.  In any case, once this number is
exhausted the discussion can move on to 666.

Well, I was going to let the issue go, but since the
nuclear-powered wagons of indignation have been circled, I suppose at
least _one_ charge of the light brigade is in order.

But speaking of matters pertaining to the ethics of writing, let me
say first that I will soon be posting some information concerning
another issue that has come to my attention only this
morning--one that I believe makes the controversy over Dale's failure
to give list members "advance warning" look like a spit-wad fight.
It's going to be very, very interesting to see what  the response is
here. If any, that is.

Aldon Nielsen asks:

>1) Did Postmodern culture in fact reprint entire posts from the
>list? I haven't seen that issue, so don't know.  This has nothing to
>do with calling lawyers, but if they did, they should not have.

Aldon, I'm not sure I follow your point here. You seem to imply that
printing _parts_ of posts is ethical practice, but not printing posts
_in whole_--or at least that the former is more appropriate than the
latter. (Up to one quarter of a post? one-third? no more than
five-eighths? What about one-sentence posts? No reprinting because
they can't be excerpted?) Frankly, if an editor is going to reprint
my words, I'd much prefer to have them in the full context I had
originally given them. Wouldn't you? Would it have been more "proper"
of Dale to subjectively choose portions of the posts in question
rather than to provide a full and faithful record of the discussion?
How so? Truth is, I don't think you can answer this convincingly
without appeal or recourse to artificially imposed restrictions of
copyright on this medium, which, of course, you may sincerely think
is a good idea. I don't.

I am not being nit-picky here, quibbling with a slight and peripheral
aporia in your argument. I am saying that the big and unacknowledged
sub-text of your opening question is that posts on this list are akin
to private literary property subject to the protocols of copyright
and the academic rituals of "fair use". And to that I say hogwash.

I _do_ agree with you that editors should, as a matter of personal
courtesy, inform people that their posts will be printed elsewhere,
or that post-authors should automatically be sent a copy of the
reprint. Dale, I'm sure, will agree that he could and should have
done this (though let's be clear that to his credit he reprinted
every single word of every post he selected, right down to the
numbers and headers, providing a true sense of the original context
of the exchange so that no one was in any way misrepresented.)

But the key point in this matter is whether or not the post-author's
"permission" is required, and particularly when what is being
reprinted directly pertains to the editorial policy of the editor's
journal. The answer, to my mind, is an emphatic No. (nota bene: In
fact, Aldon, if the matter were sufficiently interesting to them, it
would be perfectly correct and appropriate for the editors of
Postmodern Culture to reprint my public posts on the list regarding
their journal without seeking my "permission.")

It really comes down to the greater context and background history
that creates the curious sort of language game we are a part of here.
And that greater context is that our discourse here is available,
immediately and freely (in every sense of that word), to millions on
the World Wide Web. Once we freely choose to enter it,
we choose to enter an unprecedentedly collective space, one that is
qualitatively different in form and dynamic from the traditional
means of literary packaging and commodification. I don't want to
sound arrogant about it, but we list members should really just get
used to this and stop thinking that rules and protocols and "personal
values" that have their origins in 17th century social and cultural
relations--and which have formed the legal and ideological
proprieties of print culture up to the present--apply in any feasible
way to a mode of information production that has radically superseded
those relations and made the ideology of authorship engendered by
them something akin to the tenuous status of the Right of Estate
around the time of Cromwell. (A tortuously long sentence, but for a
sophisticated and elegant explanation of the development of writing
as individual property see Susan Stewart's  _Crimes of Writing_.)

So my point would be, absolutely and in principle, that the Buffalo
Poetics list is an always/already free and public space, and when one
posts something (argument or poem or mixture of the two) in such a
radically democratic forum _it should be with the assumption_ that
those bytes of information are free for the taking and sharing. It
will undoubtedly be the case that mechanisms of capitalist legality
will come to be rigidly imposed on the web too, but until then I
modestly propose:  If one wants to claim his or her words as private
property, well, then he or she should go publish them in
institutional mediums where his or her "authority" (and all the
psychological security provided by that notion) is firmly guaranteed
by the State.

I published parts 8 & 9; there's not much
you can read from my site (one page =96 it's
really a teaser!), but you'll find it in the
section of in-print books:

http://choengmon.lib.utah.edu/~calexand/nonce/presswork/index.html

or you can head to the main section (URL
below) and follow the "presswrk" link. There's
some of Sheila's work in the n/formation archive
(under "previous"), issue #2; issue #1 contains
a reprint of one of Peter's chapbooks.

Kent - I'm just as thrilled as you are to be at loggerheads!

I like your image of "primal glossalalia" (possibly redundant?) - though
I don't see it that way. Breton's litany, as I said before, has to me a
somewhat mechanical feel to it.  My point about "agency" is that a
"good" love poem ought to make room for that in some way. It's not
obligated to, as you point out, but I think it will suffer as a result,
be less than what it could.

As for whether or not sex is essential or constructed, I would say that
all the colorful examples you use to support your claim for it as being
essential really support mine! (how's that for jiu-jitsu eh?) The
repertory of gestures you cite comprises a language, a basic grammar of
sex, a set of signs which even most animals evidently must employ in
order to commence passion. In humans, certainly, the highly stylized
vocabulary by which we express and enact the rites of love confers on
that enactment a greater degree of passion and gravity.

Having said that, I'm in danger of doing a double jiu-jitsu on myself,
since you could argue that this is just what Breton is doing in his poem
- performing an erotic incantation, calling the whole into being through
a fetishistic invocation of parts. I refer once again to De Beauvoir's
highly useful chapter on Breton's vision of woman in _Second Sex_.
According to her, Breton conflates woman with both nature and  poetry -
she is the "mediatress," and "the key" - to the world, to revelation.
Breton's idealisation does not address whether love performs the same
service for women. "Woman interests him only because she is a privileged
voice." But this investing of woman as  privileged object  by Breton
also has the effect of  robbing her of privilege. Which leads us back to
your and Tom Mandel's earlier remarks about the ineluctable
"objectification" of the Other.

It's nice to finally find something to disagree on with Mark P and
Pat P. But guys, I just don't see Breton's poem as sexist in any
way. That the addressee has no "agency" does not seem a good
argument: Should everyone in a poem have "agency"? And besides, I
don't see Breton as having much macho agency in this poem at
all--why, he's reduced to a kind of primal glossolalia, the femme
doing jiu-jitsu flips on the poor man's capacity to think "like a
man" and bring her under the power and control of his reason.

It may be that you're right, Pat, that sexual expression is
predominantly a cultural construction, but I don't think so. Each
culture has its own rituals and oddities to be sure, but in sex, at
bottom (though here I want to say that I don't consider myself an
expert, because I've only had sex once--when I was nineteen), all
cultures exhibit _animal_ behavior. I don't mean "animal" like when
one gets excited and just goes crazy-- I mean in the sense of
ritualistically objectifying the other, of focusing on the desired
one without giving a hoot for his or her "agency"; I mean fixating on
body parts, and showing the other your own "parts", whether the
showing be a blue, bulging throat, a crimson rump shoved into the
air, or a love poem full of surrealist images.

My own sense of this issue is stated in the welcome message and underscored
by recent posts on the matter by Aldon, Kali, and Matt. I should note that
David Caplan, the author of the PMC article, did contact me, twice, even
though the quotations he was using were authorized by fair use (he didn't
need my permission or anyone else’s for anything quoted in his article).
Writers have the right to quote from excerpts of published material in the
course of a discussion of that material and you don't need to get
permission to do that (and that accounts for citations of the list in the
footnotes to a number of articles: quoting from the list is no different
than quoting from a printed source in that respect). Printing a work in its
entirety is another matter.

I can't tell if this is terrifically dull or interesting in some way ...
But so much these days strikes me like that.

By the way, here is the information on that PMC essay:

Yes, "experimental" takes sad thumping there, again.  "Poetry," perhaps worn out
anyway, doesn't fare well, either.  There may not be alternative terms...
Circumventing, or out and out dismantling, the advertizing game altogether?
What's been done in other cultural situations when similar co-opting has
rendered terms meaningless or otherwise degraded them?  "Scientific Creationism"
is an example of the degradation of "science" that James Eldredge ("Creationism
isn't science") and others have had to struggle with; the term and movement
threatened, among other things, science education in the schools.  (Of course,
"poetry" has already been ruined "in the schools"...  "Literature,"
"multi-culturalism," even "English" anymore, generally.)

Personally, smile, I believe you are most definitely "an experimental poet," by
the way, and Plaina
Joyless, obviously, most definitely is Not "an experimental poet" anymore than
Pat Robertson is a "scientist."  But I'm flirting with the issue.

Hmm, just reading some Nancy Chodorow (Feminism and Psychoanalytic Theory--by
the way, Freudians and "anti"freudians on the list, Chodorow has got a bit to
say about Freud and Lacan one won't find in dull and thin texts).  Anyway, come
across the term "orthodox," as in orthodox psychoanalysis, but also, orthodox
buddhist, orthodox jew, orthodox whatevers.  Perhaps start a longterm campaign
referring to academic and mainstream poetries as "orthodox poetries"?  Ah, just
skirting the issues again.  Steve Tills

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Hillary Rodham Clinton said in a meeting with
reporters Wednesday that "we are all going to have to rethink how we deal
with" the Internet because of the handling of White House sex scandal
stories on Web sites.

In an otherwise low-key question and answer session, Mrs. Clinton was at her
most intense when asked whether she favored curbs on the Internet, which has
been accused of disseminating rumor and gossip to the news being reported.

"We are all going to have to rethink how we deal with this, because there
are all these competing values ... Without any kind of editing function or
gatekeeping function, what does it mean to have the right to defend your
reputation?," she said.

"There used to be this old saying that the lie can be halfway around the
world before the truth gets its boots on," Mrs. Clinton added. "Well, today,
the lie can be twice around the world before the truth gets out of bed to
find its boots."  >>

I'm OK, better than I was feeling at Minnesota, that's for sure.  Looks like
I'll be staying at Duke for another year.  Did I tell you the story of my
rejection from Villanova?  I was "too identified with cultural studies."
Jesus.  But my writing is actually going pretty well; I'm focused -- it's
time to fish or cut bait, as Olson once said.  Would you care to see the
draft opening chapter of my book?  (Maybe that's too much to read right
now.)

Subject:      Why I'm not an experimental poet

"Scientific method in process" might produce some 'interesting' work in
poetry, but of a rather limited sort.  Neo Formalism, on the other end of the
spectrum, can be of interest too, though more than often lands in the mud.
It seems to me though that the Mac Low Method shares at least one common
element with its formal nemesis.  Both purposely limit their palate in order
to discover something new, or to compress language to such a degree that
it functions indepenendent, or at a greater distance from, an author's intent.

The results often stink on either end, and there are University departments
eager to vacuum the mess on both sides.  What little there is of worth coming
out of all this poetry is probably an accumulation of a life's attention
to both language and the environment of the poet.  A prophet like Blake is
rare and offers less of an experimental gesture than a blunt hammer slammed
on the anvil.  His example makes puddles of the extremes poetry today offers
on the left or the right.  It's not so much an experiment as being charged
with a daring to step into unknown, and hence, unexplored regions.  But
Blake didn't 'experiment' or play with language so much as execute it
in such a way that it conveyed the depth of his emotionally active
intelligence.

Still, that neo formal stuff seems like it would have some possibility, in
that it worked for Keats et al.  Just as, I suppose, at one time it was
very liberating to create poem out of random words spilled to the floor
(the way you can do it on a refrigerator now - magnetically).  Both sides
seem to have lost something though.  What Blake was after is probably
unimagininable to practitioners of today's poetic cousins.

Reading Crayon's festschrift for Jackson Mac Low of late (a really great job
in every department), I was intrigued at Mordecai Mac Low's discussion of
his father's work as an instance of scientific methodology in process, since
Mordecai is in particular position to know whereof he speaks on this topic.

I still feel profoundly uncomfortable with the idea of the "experimental"
tho, what with its sense that "this may not work" and the "trial and error"
sense of process. But today I've discovered a deeper reason why I'm not an
experimental poet.

West Chester University's 4th annual summer writers conference (June 10-13)
focuses this year on "Exploring Form & Narrative" and offers a workshop on
"Experimental Forms" taught by...Dana Gioia.

I'm not making this up.

Some of the other sessions to be taught: Meter (Timothy Steele), Rhyme
(Charles Martin), the Sonnet (RS Gwynn), French Forms (Phillis Levin) and
Blank Verse (Alfred Corn). There is also an "Introduction to Form" taught by
Cynthia Zarin who, as the brochure says, has work that "appears frequently
in The New Yorker."

There will also be a "celebration" of the Hudson Review (Louis Simpson,

Now, I'm perfectly willing to concede that one could get real value from
some of the sessions (Marilyn Nelson is teaching a master class, for

represents the idea of "form" insults my intelligence as it should that of
any poet born after Baudelaire and Blake. That it is being held at a state

So that is why I am not an experimental poet.

Something happened to the Poetics List digest for 8 to 9 February making it
unreadable on my computer. It contained the following announcement, which I
hope listmembers won't mind if I re-post, in case others missed it too.
     JT
==============================================
Announcement - current February 1998 - Jacket # 2 is complete.

Jacket magazine - free, fast-loading, international, full of stylish
writing - on the Internet, at

 http://www.jacket.zip.com.au

     Jacket # 2 is now complete.
          It focuses mainly on the work of JOHN ASHBERY -

John Ashbery : two interviews (1985 and 1988), and a new Ashbery poem /
Marjorie Perloff on "Normalizing John Ashbery" / John Tranter : 3 John
Ashberys / Eliot Weinberger on James Laughlin (1914-1997) / David Lehman -
more on the Ern Malley hoax / Bob Perelman's "The Marginalization of
Poetry" discussed by Silliman, Lauterbach, Spahr, Evans and Kate Lilley...
and Bob Perelman! / poems by Peter Riley, Lee Ann Brown, John Kinsella,
Eileen Myles, August Kleinzahler, Jennifer Moxley, Robert Adamson, Forrest
Gander, Tim Davis, Michael Heller, Denis Gallagher / Eliot Weinberger -
Letter from New York: "Vomit" / and other poems and articles.

In November 1997, Jacket was the featured Internet site on the Electronic
Poetry Center at the State University of New York at Buffalo. The EPC is a
leading experimental poetry site.

In December 1997, Jacket was among the top recommended sites on Web Del
Sol, a major literary arts Internet conglomerate site in the US.

In December 1997, Jacket won the "Best of the Web" award from the Poetry
Mining Company, an Internet site in New York.

The first issue of Jacket contains interviews with English poet Roy Fisher
and Australian aboriginal poet Lionel Fogarty, a piece on cyber-poetry in
the age of the Internet, a look at the 1943 hoax poet Ern Malley (including
rare childhood photos!) , work by Charles Bernstein, Elaine Equi, Pamela
Brown, Alfred Corn, Joanne Burns, Tracy Ryan, Carl Rakosi, Beth Spencer,
Peter Minter, Susan Schultz and Paul Hoover, together with reviews, other
prose and poetry pieces and plentiful photos and art work. Jacket # 1 was
complete in October 1997.

Jacket # 3 is being uploaded as we speak, and will be complete in late
April 1998. It already contains poems by Joel Lewis, Michele Leggott, Kris
Hemensley, Peter Gizzi, Hans Magnus Enzensberger, Tom Clark and Johanna
Drucker, and a review of Charles Nicholl's enlightening biography "Somebody
Else - Rimbaud in Africa".

Issue # 3 is dedicated to the memory of the Australian poet JOHN FORBES,
who died unexpectedly on 23 January at the age of 47 at his home in
Melbourne. It contains a poem by him ("Speed: A Pastoral"), and poems by
some of his friends.

Jacket is free, and (thus) is at present unable to pay contributors.
Also, I don't have the time yet to deal with unsolicited submissions. Sorry.

Ron, I think understand the irritation behind your remarks, but
is it necessary for those who've exploded the borders of poetry
to cavil at those who want to implode poetic space? Aren't there
infinite possibilities in both directions? (To paraphrase Niels Bohr,
the language of the inside of the atom is the language poetry.)
It's not a conference that appeals to me particularily, but I don't
think any one contingent/movement (not language writing, & certainly
not the new formalism) has cornered the market on innovation--not yet
anyway.

Well, to many other folks' minds, the answer about permission is an
emphatic *yes*, and what makes your assertion of eminent domain any
more valid than their assertion of intellectual property rights?
"stealin my shit from me / don't make it yrs / makes it stolen," as

Oh, nonsense.  Folks blathering about the "new and unprecedented" nature
of e-communication make me tired. Ain't nothin new about this--it's
same-old same-old. People talk, share ideas, share work, write to each
other.  Everybody thought *television* was gonna be some new, liberating
medium.  See any sign of it?  And, while we're at it, why shouldn't anything
broadcast on TV be "free" as well? Surely the logic behind your argument
about POETICS should hold for broadcast TV.  And what's this silliness
'bout a "radically democratic" forum? What's "democratic" about POETICS?
It's a free-for-all w/a benign dictator--votes don't carry any weight here.
Email listservs are publications, like other publications--they just get
into print quicker.  I refuse to give up my rights to the material I
produce in this space any more than I'd give 'em up if I published in a
hard-copy journal.

Sorry to inform you, but the state protects "authority" on the internet
as well--as any site devoted to the legal issues of internet publication
will demonstrate.  Just try lifting a Disney cartoon off their site and
see how quick they slap you with a suit.  Copyright is there to protect
the interests of the author--interests, I'd think, that many of us share.
If I *want* to give my work away, fine. (And I do--I publish most of what
I write on the Net, so people can see it for free.)  But it ain't your
right to *take* it (and particularly take it and *sell* it) unless I give
my permission.

Bah.

True, poetry is a marginalized artform--even at the queer bookstores, =
where that which is marginal is reclaimed, poetry still gets shoved into =
the back of the store (just the way queer literature gets shelved in =
mainstream bookstores).  But this does not make poetry a "subculture."  In =
order to constitute a subculture, poets would have to share common rituals,=
 dress, speech, etc. and, generalizations about poets aside, there is no =
critical mass of shared traits from which to argue the existence of such a =
subculture. If anything, judging from the poets I have known, poets belong =
to a kind of "anti-subculture." But even that assessment is reductive. =

     Before Foucault was Foucault, at least in the U.S., Rich Grossinger
translated that early section of _The Order of Things_ for his Ph.D.
language exams at the University of Michigan and published it in _Io_, #4
(probably 68 or 69).  He neglected to note that this was an early section
out of a history, and many of us first new of Foucault as a weird French
magus...

    By the way, I would recommend _Io_ to any one who can find a file of
them.  Much of the vitality of the poetry of that period resulted from the
fact that it was being cooked up in close connection with large doses of
information about stuff.  I suppose some of the information in _Io_ would
now seem new-ageish, but, of course, it was pre-new-age.  And (I had changed
the original subject line, but now I can add baseball again) in addition to
issues on doctrine of signatures, ethnoastronomy, ecology, etc., there is a
great issue on baseball.

    As I noted in that earlier post, Derrida comes closer to a kind of
Neoplatonism with every book.   _On the Name_ is closer to the writings of
renaisance magicians than to the Nietzsche and Heidegger that he begun with.

    Ron, one of the generation of our father-poets, and I do not remember
which one, but I am inclined to think it was Jackson, objected to being
called an experimental poet on the grounds that experimenting implied that
one did not know what one was doing. The poem was not an experiment, it was
an event.  Or would it have been David Antin?

I had mentioned in my previous message that I would be posting
information about an issue that had recently come to my attention. I
hereby give Postmodern Culture, Lingua Franca, The Chronicle of
Higher Education, Mike and Dale's Younger Poets, and anyone who would
like, permission to reprint this message and to do so without first
consulting me.

In the past months I have been engaged in correspondence with one of
the world's most prominent visual poets (as well as theoreticians of
visual poetics). This poet is Latin American and is fairly out of
touch with recent developments in the "non-visual" poetry scene in
the U.S. This poet had enthusiastically agreed to collaborate with me
in the editing of an anthology of Latin American visual poetries
from Noigandres on, including essential theoretical works, and we
had begun to discuss this in some detail, including plans for my
visiting him in South America for a long stay during my sabbatical
this year. My sabbatical is due to be approved (a formality) next
week by the board of trustees of my college. My application is
completely based on a description of the above project, for which
there has been considerable enthusiasm and support here.

Two days ago I received a long letter from the poet I have mentioned
telling me that he was greatly looking forward to undertaking this
project, that he was organizing his "complete" archives of Latin
American visual poetry, and assuring me that what would be produced
would be a document of the first power.

This morning I received a letter from this poet and it said (I gloss
and paraphrase) the following:

"My dear friend Kent: I find myself in an extremely uncomfortable
position. I have received various communications from close friends
in the United States who strongly question my relationship with you.
These are people to whom I owe my loyalty since some of them helped
secure my release from prison under the junta and have helped my work
in many ways...... I feel it is important for you to settle your
situation with those circles of the American critcal community which
seem so antagonistic toward you. I hope you will be able to overcome
this unfortunate situation and that we might be able to reestablish
our collaboration."

Some important things stand out here: 1) It is quite evident, I think
it's safe to say, that this sabotaging of an important and needed
project is related to the opinions of certain people about another
project I have been involved in and which has caused a fair amount of
discussion and controversy. 2) That what is involved is, to some
degree, an organized campaign, since the "various communications"
arrived within the past two days. 3) That those involved in
successfully urging an end to the professional and personal
relationship that had been established between myself and the other
person in question are willing to scuttle a good faith and seriously
undertaken effort--one that aimed to give exposure to relatively
unrecognized poets in Latin America-- and that they are willing to do
this to placate their own discomfort and dissapproval about another
body of work.

I want to make it clear that I hold no resentment whatsoever toward
the poet for his decision to postpone our collaboration. He is a
person who has worked with a great deal of vision and selflessness,
and he is someone who has put his life on the line in the struggle
for justice in his country. It is completely understandable that he
would wish to excercise the utmost caution in light of such strong
and unexpected warnings (eventhough he was aware of the controversy
around the Yasusada work and I had sent him a copy of the book). I
have written him that I understand that he has been placed in a very
awkward and difficult position and that his loyalty to previous
friendships is important. But I did tell him that I felt his
friends had acted in ways that are unprincipled beyond belief and
that it was still my hope that we might be able to clarify the
matter.

Therefore, I am writing this as an open appeal to those who are
involved in poisoning this importnt project to have the self-respect
and professional integrity to come forward and explain your actions.
I have never shied away from discussing my ideas and feelings about
the Yasusada writings, and if you feel that work somehow disqualifies
me from undertaking this project then I would invite you to a
dialogue. Have the courage to approach me personally.

And I am making this appeal here because I know that those involved
are on or in close contact with people on this list.

And you have behaved rather disgracefully.

shi is the "on yomi" or sino-Japanese word, while "yon" is 4 in the "kun
yomi" or yamato-kotoba indigenous Japanese reading.  I don't think that
variations in usage are regional, more than you use one in some
circumstances and the other in other circumstances.

Hi Ron,

This has to be short because it is very close to dinner time and I don't
want to wait to send this.

Sorry to hear about your pneumonia- Miekel's advice sounds very good-
especially the rest. (By the way, Miekel,I hope Liz Was is feeling better
too!)

I appreciated your post on Freudian analysis, though I must confess to
racing through or missing some of the other posts on this topic. I
especially enjoyed what you said about Professor Crews, whose articles in
the New York Review of Books were recently thrown out by me, with some
regret, because they were in the class of "I must respond to this in some
way."

What you said about it being good that psychoanalysis is taught at private
institutes is true, I guess. I am a graduate of one such place, the
Postgraduate Center, in NYC. I guess I consider myself a post Freudian
analyst, as most analysts I'm sure would say. I am very interested in
hearing more about the reputation of psychoanalysis among poets.

Best wishes,
Nick

Letters don't need iron.  They are already fully magnetized.
The question is does the poet have any iron in the stomach.
Blake ate crowbars for breakfast.  Melville, on the other hand,
was a born harpoon.  (I'm a little red fire truck.)

after having a shitty day debugging somebodies' netscape problems it a
real cheer to come home & seeing everybody throwing "experimental" on
the passe terminologly of 20th century scrapheap. Ive been discribing my
work as experimental as opposed to sound/text/sound, intermedia,
multimedia, interdiscinplinary etc etc since very young, and being one
whose spleen be to never do the same thing twice, find many perks in the
ambiguity of the designation experimental or experimedia, thinking of
mad science in the way that tentitively, a convenience has brought life
& performance & text & neoism into the realm of scientific --inquiry.

why nothing, at least not in any final sense. I mean life is full
of unfinished arguments, right? But you're sort of adding to _my_
argument-- i.e. when it comes to staked claims of "intellectual
property," no matter how barbed the fence that is strung, we are
dealing in an area of undecidability, of utter subjectivity and will.
The fence is a phantasm, a shimmer of false consciousness, a little
fart of history. Who wrote the deed you are holding in your hand?

Shoot, that was the first time in my life I have ever said anything
mildly theoretical about the Net, and I thought I was going to blow
everyone away!

Thus, the ruling class will sleep more soundly tonight, for nothing

Telecommunications bill!

I am all for free TV!! Did I sound like I wasn't? But capital does
these weird things to freedom...

>and what's this silliness 'bout a "radically democratic" forum?
>What's "democratic" about POETICS?

OK, radically democratic and _open_? I mean that when I
press the send button for this, people who aren't subscribed to the
list can read it before it's posted to the subscribers. It is
available, always/already (forgive me for that term), to millions.
Why (and this is the main question I was posing) would I be so
protective about my post? What leads me to desire to control its
distribution if I've already willingly entered it into an
uncontrollable space? And don't tell me I'm being silly because,
well, not that many people peek at the Poetics archives...

Fair enough. But then perhaps you should join the campaign to more
effectively extend existing copyright law into the Web? And actually,
here's a question. Let's say you had participated in the Mike and
Dale's discussion and Dale had called to tell you he wanted to
reprint your posts in full, along with numerous others. And
let's say that you were in a bad mood or something like that and said
No. And let's say that Dale said, Well I wan't _asking_ you, I was
just informing you because this discussion is about the integrity of
my magazine. And then he went ahead and did it. Published it, I
mean. You have one call. Who do you call first?

Yes, thank you for that information. But is this a settled issue
or a contested one, still very fluid, with important implications.
I'm open to having my mind changed on this issue, really, I am. But
here's a last and very serious question: Why would you want to be on
the same side of this "intellectual property" issue as the Disney
Corporation?

>Bah.

Bah to you too.

 >>                Origins of Today's Imbroglio:
 >>
 >>   Throughout this century Western countries, primarily the United
 >>States and Great Britain, have continually interfered in and
 >>manipulated events in the Middle East. The origins of the
 >>Iraq/Kuwait conflict can be found in the unilateral British decision
 >>during the early years of this century to essentially cut off a
 >>piece of Iraq to suit British Empire desires of that now faded era.
 >>   Rather than agreeing to Arab self-determination at the end of World
 >>War I and the collapse of the Ottoman Empire, Western nations conspired
 >>to divide the Arab world into a number of artificial and barely viable
 >>entities; to install Arab "client regimes" throughout the region, to
 >>make these regimes dependent on Western economic and military power
 >>for survival; and then to impose an ongoing series of economic,
 >>cultural, and political arrangements seriously detrimental to the
 >>people of the area.  This is the historical legacy that we live with
 >>today.
 >>   Throughout the 1930s and the 1940s the West further manipulated the
 >>affairs of the Middle East in order to control the resources of the
 >>region and then to create a Jewish homeland in an area long considered
 >>central to Arab nationalism and Muslim concerns.  Playing off one regime
 >>against the other and one geopolitical interest against another became a
 >>major preoccupation for Western politicians and their closely associated
 >>business interests.
 >>
 >>                  Following World War II:
 >>
 >>   After World War II, and from these policy origins, the United States
 >>became the main Western power in the region, supplanting the key roles
 >>formerly played by Britain and France.  In the 1960s Gamel Abdel Nasser
 >>was the target of Western condemnation for his attempt to reintegrate
 >>the Arab world and to pursue independent "non-aligned" policies. By the
 >>1970s the CIA had established close working relationships with key Arab
 >>client regimes from Morocco and Jordan to Saudi Arabia and Iran -
 >>regimes
 >>that even then were among the most repressive and undemocratic in the
 >>world - in order to further American domination and to secure an
 >>ever-growing supply of inexpensive oil and the resultant flow of
 >>petrodollars.
 >>   By the late 1970s the counter-reaction of the Iranian revolution was
 >>met with a Western build-up of the very same Iraqi regime that is so
 >>condemned today in a vain attempt to use Iraq to crush the new Iranian
 >>regime.  The result was millions of deaths coming on top of the
 >>terrible devastation of Lebanon, itself a country that had been severed
 >>from Greater Syria by Western intrigues, as had been the area of
 >>southern Syria, then known as Palestine.  Additionally the Israelis
 >>were given the green light to invade Lebanon, further devastate the
 >>Palestinians, and install a puppet Lebanese government - an attempt
 >>which failed leading to an American and Israeli retreat but ongoing
 >>militarism to this day.  Meanwhile, throughout all these years Western
 >>manipulation of oil supplies and pricing, coupled with arms sales
 >>policies, often seriously exacerbated tensions between countries in
 >>the region leading to the events of this decade.

 >>to the Gulf War in 1990.  Indeed, we would be remiss if we did not note

 >>Iraq that it would become the pivotal military state of the area in
 >>coordination with the U.S.   Whether true or not the U.S. subsequently
 >>did everything in its power to prevent a peaceful resolution of the
 >>conflict and for the first time intervened with massive and overwhelming
 >>military force in the region creating today's dangerously unstable
 >>quagmire.
 >>   The initially stated American goal was only to protect Saudi Arabia.
 >>Then after the unprecedented  military build-up the goal became to expel
 >>Iraq from Kuwait.  Then the goal evolved to toppling  the Iraqi
 >>government.  And from there the Americans began to impose various limits

 >>repeatedly attempt to topple the Iraqi government; and placed a
 >>near-total embargo on Iraq that many - including a former Attorney
 >>General of the United States - have termed near-genocidal.  The overall
 >>result has been the subjugation and impoverishment of Iraq and the
 >>actual death of approximately 5% of the Iraqis as the direct result
 >>of American sanctions, plus the reallocation of oil quotes and
 >>petrodollars to American client-states.

 >>strangulation.  Furthermore, these policies are being pursued even
 >>while Israel and key Arab client states are receiving American weapons
 >>in ever larger amounts, with Israel's weapons of mass destruction
 >>making her forces 7 to 8 times stronger than all Arab armies combined.

Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

monday nite at the cinnabar theater in petaluma a welcome chance to hear
fellow-listling charles alexander read his poetry. He read from "pushing
water", a title that surely helped open up the work. . .earlier that day i
had watched a waterfall & rapids, fascinated to see the rocks "pushing
water" into serried patterns of many variations, but that's not the only
way to hear those poems. They surely are generously available to being read
from several approaches. Also he read his postcard series, and it was an
intense pleasure to follow his handling of the small space. Intellectual
jazz, where "a tear is an intellectual thing".

Also reading : roderigo toscano, and hung q. tu. Nor had I heard either of
these read before, and have no sure sense of their work on the page. The
smoosh of traffic from petaluma bvd interfered (i wass sitting at the back
of the room) but i began to cotton to both roderigo's hard-edge urban

kent johnson goes on at some length about the list being a "free and open
space" and thus what people post is not theirs.  i suggest you all look at
the welcome message that says that posting on the list is a form of
publication.  now, in my book, publication means publication, i.e. if your
name is on it, it's yours.  if someone wants to loosely paraphrase what's
said on the list without attributing authorship, that's one thing; but if
people's specific words are quoted and their names appeared somewhere in
their own post and the quoted material, i would consider this to be
publication and subject to the same general courtesies that apply to
photocopying someone's work, citing it in your own work, etc.

MAIL ART EXHIBIT

CHIAPAS

The First Social Revolution of the III Millenium


        The right of all peoples to fight with the weapons of ethical and
social justice to lead free and decent lives.

        The Zapatista Army of National Liberation of Chiapas, Mexico, is
fighting to overcome the social and economic inequalities forcing countless
millions of human beings all over the world to live and die like animals in
hunger and deprivation. "We are all Marcos"  fighting with  reason, truth, and
for the justice of our cause  to raise the standards of living for our people.

        We are simply unable to exist as we do, struggling to improve our
living conditions, unless our lives are valued according to basic human
principles. "Others" also live and suffer as we do under a system that wields
powers often unwanted  by them.
Our human nature , our human essence, enables us to recognize that their
"otherness" is  ours, even if they fail to think like us.

        The bloodless revolution in Chiapas launched by the people and their
representatives and modified by world public opinion, through revolutionary
announcements in all media,  above all through the Internet, have made the
humanitarian principles of The First Social Revolution of the III Millenium a
model to follow.

Mediums: no restrictions, including street mail, e-mail, and fax.
Forms and types: no restrictions, but all submissions must be in two dimensions
(no cartons or boxes, no artists' books, no     sculptures, etc.)

All submissions will be exhibited and every artist will receive written
acknowledgment of his participation in the exhibit.

The exhibition will be located at AEBU, the Uruguayan Employee Bankers
Association, Montevideo, Uruguay,  and later in other cities of the interior.
After the exhibition, all the works of art received will be turned over to the
Zapatista Army of National Liberation, Chiapas, Mexico.

that was Jackson, I believe. But when I read Ron's post what came to mind
immediately were Antin's lines: "If Robert Frost is a poet, then I don't want
to be a poet, if Robert Lowell is a poet that I don't want to be a poet...."

And Derrida's new book " Le monolinguisme de l'autre" (well, one of the three
1996 books) is all about the I of the author (JD), is in fact pure
autobiography "I am the most Judeo-Franco-Maghrebian of all" -- And weaves a
gorgeous piece of writing out of his musings on his (not-under-erasure) origins
and lack of a (jewish) mothertongue.
--  (I think a shortened version came out in English as "Echoes from
Elsewhere.")

Ron Silliman's post on Freud was thought provoking.  I am wondering
whether a Freudian Institute is less an academy than a university (is). If
you are a Freudian in an English dept., you will be around people who can
tell you you are full of it on a daily basis.  Whereas in a Freudian
institution presumably everyone will be a Freudian, creating a sort of
wierd insular feeling.  Ths is perhaps why Crews, boring though he might
be, ran circles around the analysts in his debate with them.  I was
frustrated by this debate, because I wanted to hear better arguments from
the Freudian defenders, but they were utterly lame.

As for the institutionalization of poetry, and the insistence that poetry
be legitimated OFF campus...yes, it should. But Silliman wrote in a 1990
essay that every English dept. should have a specialist in post 1945
literature, that the university was a useful site of contestation,
etc...Does this represent a change in thinking, or am I misreading
something here?

Warren Spahn won 363 games, not 323, although he was born on April 23 in 1921
in Buffalo, NY, which makes him an honorary member of this list, no? And one
year senior to Jackson. Spahn also won 4 world series games, not included in
this total.

No, Finnegan, I don't think that the history of literature is as value neutral
as you make it sound. Innovation is not a value to pre-modernists, such as the
majority of those who will be at West Chester. Tim Steele writes as if the
19th century is still up for grabs. And it amounts to fraud to tell students
otherwise.

Not to suggest that Ron Silliman IS making this up, but I checked the
website mentioned in his post (for the same reason, I guess, that some
motorists gawk at automobile accidents on the highways), and it says that
the "Experimental Forms" class is taught by Charles Martin, and that Dana
Gioia is teaching "Translation" (The "Master Class" is Molly Peacock's,
and Alfred Corn is "Working in Rhyme" and Marilyn Nelson is doing "The
Sonnet").  The keynoter, by the way, is Anthony Hecht.
        Still have to agree with the gist of his post concerning formatted
pre-fab poetry being passed off as the last word on poetic form. And for
those prices, there better be an open bar at all the receptions.

Well Kent, I also will wade in, since we are **all** refusing to drop the
issue, and since it's reasonable pertinent to the concerns we all have
here on the List, about how writing "acts" in public spaces...

Aldon and you are two of the really lively presences on the list, who
contribute a lot, for my money...And I do think that between you you've
articulated the issues with exceptional clarity...

I think Aldon is basically right on this one.

Various qualifications can be made..To an extent quoting without asking
permission can be lived with.  But oddly enuff, for the one that's arguing
the laisse faire libertarian sort of position, you're reducing everthing
too much to a level of highly technical, "literal" rule-interpretation.
No, this isn't a matter for litigiousness.  But I would absolutely state
(as someone who posts here a certain amount) that I HOPE that as a
matter of courtesy and probity I be asked before anything I post here
(especially other than very brief snippets) be quoted in a public forum.

That is largely how writing works and how writers and poets should behave
toward each other.  I know you're busy disassembling the social
construction of the poet-author and all, and I think you're creating some
very interesting waves while doing it.  And yes like any form of
publication this is a very public space.  But ! I still exist in three
dimesnions some of the time (I think) and have various personal and
intellectual reasons I'd like to have some say in where and how my
thoughts and involvements are used and abused.

I may not get what I want, but if you try sometime you can....At least
state your basic principles, and wishes...

stonily,
Mark P.

I'm not sure about Spahn's win total...But it was very impressive and (as
he does tend to remind people in interviews...!) should always be placed
next to the fact that 3 or 4 of what should have been his greatest years
were spent fighting in WWII.

Also, he was one of the great hitting pitchers of all time.  I've always
thought that the possiblity tha the pitcher might get a dramatic and
game-deciding hit, added to the dynamism and excitment of a game.  Must
have been the case when you watched Ruth as a pitcher too, or Gibson.

One other point: Spahn is helping Ted Williams with his public campaign to
get Shoeless Joe (no, that's not another one of my country blues
favorites) into the Hall of Fame.  A huge hand to both of 'em....

I remember there was an extensive discussion about a year ago over how to
name what seems like experimental (like lab coat technicians) or
avant-garde (too sickly military) writing.

I also remember Jackson MacLow recently in these parts mentioning his
son's article, how he thought "experimental" is incorrect when it slides
into chance.  According to his son, a poem could be written by chance
methods only if one applied the same method several times and got
different poems each time.  Since Jackson often uses the computer, there
is no margin for difference in the work, the same procedural method will
always issue the same poem if no variables are changed.

Though it is funny to mention that Harry Mathews once mentioned that in
the Oulipo game of exchanging every noun with the 7th noun after it in a
dictionary (n + 7), often the results would be very different, even if
everyone was using the same dictionary.

That mentioned, I'd say in all honesty I strive to be an *experimental
poet*.  I like the idea of technicians in lab coats (scientism aside), and
I like the idea that a poem might not work.  There is a sense that a
certain understanding of reality might not work.  This leaves writing more
vulnerable to failure, but also to more absurd solutions, and for me
includes the "what if..." which leaves possibility open.  The idea that
truth is an experiment, and could very well fail, is at the heart of a
project like Derrida's.  Don Byrd, interesting you call Derrida's recent
work "neoplatonist", and I'm not exactly sure if you would call St.
Augustine a neoplatonist, but there is an interesting moment in The
Confessions where Augustine says he needs to *make* truth.  Derrida picks
this up in Archive Fever, just tangentially, tho that recent item is one
of my favorites.

Well, in relation to the conference that Ron mentioned, I agree about the
ridiculously closed use of experiment which will be assumed at such a
conference.  Maybe my biggest objection would be to seperating
"experimentalism" from the other categories, i.e. why not expiremental
translation, experimental meter, etc.

I'm not ready to give up all the history and suggestivity of
"experimentalism".  The challenge is all the more interesting if one has
to recuperate such terms from interminable numbness.  Now, that said, I
think there is still something a lot more interesting than just
experimentation (now that everything is open to experiment), and it's
just around the corner, in some niche-world, but I'm not sure what it is...

what if...

He is not of course an "experimental poet" (Dana Gioa); I do recommend,
however, his essay entitled "The Successful Career of Robert Bly."  His
remarks abt. Bly's translations and influence are astute.  This essay is
to be found in Gioa's book of essays published a few years back; I don't
remember the title.

Ask to receive their "Newsletter," which is their catalog (something like

find their comments largely very knowledgable and well-grounded.  It
features hundreds of new releases every issue, and is one of the best ways
to keep up with what's available (cassette, CD and LP) in country blues,
jump blues, R&B of all sorts, piano blues, gospel, old-time hillbilly and

especially strong on my first music love, pre-1950 blues styles.

Dana Gioia, George, campaigns for the New Formalism. His mother lives in
our town, and Dana himself, after some years back East, lives nearby,
possibly in the county seat, Santa Rosa. He is highly succesful, both, I
hear, as a businessman, and certainly as a poet, for there are many and
powerful persons out there ready to welcome a champion of those verities
thee, me and a bunch of us have neglected in recent decades. And Dana is a
personable bloke, and has the gift of the gab it takes to put a p-o-v over
in these United States of Extravert Sensation-types (to cite Jung).

I read with him once at a monster-reading. He had memorized the poems he
said to us. I _think_ they rimed. One was about a cat in-heat, serenading a
tom in the tropes of Tennyson : "Come into the garden, Fred . . . I'm
wearing nothing but my flea-collar." Fun. Poets locally whom I know have
been impressed with him one-on-one. I haven't spoken with him yet.

Now don't tell us, George, that you haven't heard about the New Formalism!
The New Formalism is just like the Old Formalism ((who am I echoing
here?--the formulation, not the content)), with its necessity removed. It's
for sure caught in the contradiction of wishing to announce the end of the
avant-garde by proposing itself as something new.

I don 't think you'd want to publish in any of the venues where they play.

whose post i found interesting. In part because he used the word
"vulnerable". If one could count on this word being understood--in the
context of categories--as including _formal_ vulnerability, as well as
emotional and intellectual, I propose "vulnerable poetry" as a substitute
for experimentalism. The latter, despite the good sense in Joshua's post,
labors under an awful lot of freight by this stage, a lot of awful poems,
to speak loosely.

This proposal is not devoid of self-interest, since my most recent
published book consists of a series I title "Vulnerable Bundles," using the
adjective in just the sense proposed above. Part of the sense of it is
"conjectural"--which I first heard applied to poetry by Charles Olson. "Run
it up the flagpole and we'll see just who salutes it;" "Send out invites
and we'll see what sticks to the wall;" the flip cynicism of these phrases
(taken from Madison Avenue 40 years ago) is quite unvulnerable,no doubt
because those guys were taking risks and wanted to protect themselves from
such knowledge. But in the beginning and the end, that's part of art. And
in that sense, who wouldnt be a vulnerable poet. One would have to push
hard in arguing for the larger meaning of the term.I.e. it might well be a
vulnerable feeling to promote New Formalism in an un"Formalism" world; but
it is _not_ a vulnerable endeavor _formally_ speaking, since its been done
(& done) before. David

1) sorry about my mixup re: the archives -- Now that I am reminded that
millions in fact could access them, my head will swell to unmanageable
proportions


2) I have been opposed to most suggestions for expansion of copyright
directed at the internet -- but note that the existing copyright statutes
have already been clearly found to apply to electronic media -- the debate
really is about whether new applications of copyright will be created --
If you "publish" something, in any medium, it falls under copyright.
People may quote from it without permission ("fair use" is, however, one of
the vaguer passages in the statutes -- note different applications to song
lyrics and prose) -- people may not reproduce it "in any form" without
permission -- The people who really do want to commodify writing (like the
NY Times and the Washington Post syndicate) recognize this, and that is why
they've tried to get freelancers to sign contracts giving up their rights
to internet redistribution of their writings.
But, again, I'm only asking that we all afford each other a modest degree
of mutual respect -- a modest proposal indeed

3)  Kent's post is disturbing -- but I don't know how to respond, as the
letter was "glossed and paraphrased" -- There's clearly nothing wrong with
anybody who dislikes Kent or his work for any reason communicating their
dislike to any other party (or their love and admiration, for that matter)
-- It is entirely up to the recipient of any such communication to decide
how to act upon it --

On the other hand, I take a very dim view of people actively trying to
screw up the careers and works of others through "poison" pen, email, fax
etc --  BUT, not knowing any of the people involved, and having only a
paraphrased version of the representation of the recipient -- I simply
don't know what has happened --

Kent, can you tell us anything more specific?


4)  I have recently come into possession of previously unknown Yasusada
manuscripts -- Does anybody know who I should contact for permission to
publish them?

Kent,

I mostly keep my mouth shut on this list since I am so far outta
the loop (partially, I admit, by choice) that discussion rarely
veers into areas that are near and dear to my heart. I'm usually
happy listening, and, often, I get to read really smart people
writing really smart things. But the issue of intellectual property
does matter to me enough to comment upon it, since, in some ways
at least, it is a class issue.

One could say the same thing about property rights, generally. Hell,
one could say the same thing about brick walls.  Theoretically, of
course, the existence of the wall is in dispute, but tell that to
yer broken nose. Hardly an argument *I'd* care to to make...

And this is where we differ.  I hardly see the benefit to the working
class if we strip folks of the right to the product of their labor.
Take away intellectual property rights (the right to determine when your
work is published and where) and who wins?  The ruling class, far as I
can see.  *Especially* in the area of the new media.  If they don't have
to consult anybody for copyright permissions, what's to stop them from
assembling mega-databases of publications and then charging libraries and
individuals to access these incredibly powerful and convenient engines?
Used to be that if you wanted to see interesting new poems, you
hadda support the small journals and publishing houses that issue them
(who, in turn, support authors, at least as much as they are able). But
take away the rights of the authors and the small presses, and alluva
sudden the big publishers will be swallowing alla that work and spitting
it out for you on a pay-per-view basis, a service to which you *will*
subscribe cuz it's so damn convenient and you don't have to go rooting
around for the new stuff no more. Hell, you can't even copyright information
in a bibliography (just the format) and the big publishers like Silver
Platter and Bowker make a mint off of 'em--swallowing up and incorporating
the work of small bibliographers into their formats and not payin them a
dime. So much for free information. What winds up happenin is that small
presses die (like they're not havin a hard enough time already!), or they
are run by aristos who've got enough money to support losing ventures,
publishing as noblesse oblige or charity. It's tough enough out there with
big corps muching up entire vertical chains of production and distribution,
killin small presses and independent bookstores like slappin flies. Now you
wanna take away intellectual property rights and strip authors of practically
the only right they have--to say NO, I doanwanna be published in your
corporate megamachine?

If I give up my rights to tell Dale NO, then I've given up my rights to
tell Bowker NO. And I won't have it.

>here's a question. Let's say you had participated in the Mike and
>Dale's discussion and Dale had called to tell you he wanted to
>reprint your posts in full, along with numerous others. And
>let's say that you were in a bad mood or something like that and said

>just informing you because this discussion is about the integrity of

>mean. You have one call. Who do you call first?

Would I prosecute? No, I got better things to do, and I don't think it'd
be doing a service to my community to mire myself and the publishers of
another journal/press in a lawsuit which I'd win, but which would drain
us both.  But if you mean that it's okay cuz Dale can get away with it,
I'd have to disagree.  Would I trust Dale with my back turned or ever
work with him in any way if he did that to me? I doubt it. And I'd surely
tell a friend, if they called me up and asked me what I thought about his
reliability and trustworthiness.  (And since you've just had a hard
personal lesson in how damaging that could be, I'd think it might give you
pause.) I'm a hardass about ethics. It's one place where I cut no slack.

In the world  in which I operate, reputation is everything. I've never
signed contracts with my writers--we've always worked on a handshake.
It's not that I refuse to sign contracts. I offer the option; they decline.
I trust them and they trust me. Never needed a lawyer in any of my
dealings with a writer, and I doubt I ever will. On the other hand,
you better be damned sure that I've had lawyers look over every single
one of my book contracts with big bizniz presses, cuz I know what
they're in it for (and it ain't 'art') and I am surely glad for every
intellectual property right the law accords me. It's my choice to
exercise those rights or not, but I refuse to give them up.

>Why would you want to be on
>the same side of this "intellectual property" issue as the Disney
>Corporation?

Disney sucks. But I don't see any way to strip them of their property
rights without hurting myself in the process, particularly given their
vast command of resources.  It's sort of like supporting free speech
for Nazis--it's distasteful, but necessary.

So what about KentJohnson's troubling post earlier today about his sabotaged
project in latin america?  Is this just gonna slip by in silence?  Or are
listpods so jealous and complacent that they want to see an important project
go to pieces?  This is a bit more than a "snafu".  In fact, it confirms the
sort of petty, self-serving and snivelling fealty I have come to expect from
this 'community.'  The Yasusada poems have contributed more to poetry than
almost anything else in recent years.  If it's true that some petty acts
have prevented Kent from engaging another project then this sabotage should be
addressed.  Or maybe we wanna go on yapping about baseball or the etiquette
of email publication.  What *is* the problem behind the Yasusada works anyway?
That maybe those poems aren't the works of a nuclear holocaust survivor?  Who
cares?  The poems speak for themselves and contain an astonishing sympathetic,
if not vulnerable, clarity.  And Kent, to whatever extent he involved himself
with that project, aided in bringing some real beauty to the world.  Kent's
post this morning demanded our attention and decency.  Are there any thoughts?

Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

The post noted below is the impetus for this post but should not be taken
as a reflection on the specific contents of that post as many of the
circumstances are outside my realm of knowledge.  This post was also
promted by recent exchanges on this list.

It is becoming clear to me (as it may earlier have for others) that the
primary problem with electronic communication is that this communication
occurs within the limits of the least common denominator and this least
common denominator can be seen in terms of intelligence, language, access
to money and means of communication - e.g., speed of computer, etc.

1) In this case the South American involved wrote me recently of his
desire to join in discussions on this very list which he did not do
because of lack of comfort with English.  If I got conflicting messages
about something  in another language from the other side of the world
I would be very likely to shy away from the topic discussed.

2) Scholarly niceties and legal issues regarding information and its
communication and use exist to safeguard writers and their rights but
also to facilitate clarity.  Securing permission, for example, has a
legal and ethical basis but it also functions to ensure clarity of
communication - when I write something I would like to have the chance
for approval so that I can have some confidence my words are accurately
transmitted.

3) Kent is concerned (and rightly so) because he did not have access
to some communications about him.  Lack of openness in communication
is something that electronic communication does tend to encourage, but
more importantly it would seem in this case (possibly - this is
speculative) the least 'ethical' "conspirator" has his or her way,
analogous to the Watergate Conspiricy.

4) Electronic communication would appear to lend itself readily to
thoughts of conspiricy and suspicion - instantaneous, mysterious
communication, absence of a full range of communicative resources
(either verbal with gesture, inflection, etc. or WRITTEN which in
other contexts is more developed and carefully considered).

5) In allowing the least common dimension of communication, the
potential for snide or scuriloous comment is increased which leads
to ill-considered replies.  This combination tends to drive out
the more careful and serious participant who has more important
concerns - I would expect that up to 100 people will leave the list
if they haven'talready done so in the past week or two.

I feel that the (action, process of) writing of poetry is what is of
interest to me as a reader as well as a writer.  I have a great deal
of trouble with reification of "experiment" in relation to poetry.
I don't see how it can be understood in any sense but "To experiment,
v. to play, to do, to try..."  In this action sense I think that to
write any kind of poetry is to experiment (?to poetry?) if it is to be
worthwhile no matter how traditional the forms used.

uh . . . there have been some responses already -- and I've asked Kent if
he can provide us any more specific information so that we might be able to
judge what further response is appropriate -- If somebody was attempting to
disrupt a collaborative project by means of a poison pen letter, then that

At the risk of contradictory thinness -- IF the poems speak for themselves,
and if no one should care whether or not the poems are the work of a
nuclear holocaust survivor, then what is the purpose in presenting them in
the guise of the work of a nuclear holocaust survivor?  My reading of the
Yasusada works is that the entire "package" is part of the work -- I think
it does a disservice to the work to ignore what appears to be a primary
feature of its shaping and presentation -- If this were of no importance,
wouldn't the author simply have submitted the poems "themselves," without
the surrounding apparatus, and let them meet whatever editorial fate was
theirs to meet?  The apparatus, and the response to it, is part OF the
work, no?

Before responding to Aldon's comments below, I would like to say that
I am much less certain of my position regarding "intellectual
property" than I have perhaps tried to appear to be. I will say that
I _still_ do not think Dale committed any weighty transgression
by faithfully reprinting an already public discussion about his
magazine in his magazine. But I also think Aldon, Kali Tal, and
others have made very compelling arguments, and they make me want to
think and reflect about the bigger complications. The issues are
not easy.

I suppose my starting point for _trying_ to work through the
difficult problems involved (difficult because those problems, I
think it's clear, are fully implicated in broader questions of power
and history) would be an acknowledgment that the issues of
"intellectual property", "copyright," "attribution," and attendant
matters are (because historical) always conjunctural and best
confronted with a tactical or strategic disposition. That would mean
seeing these issues not as absolute and fixed givens
(i.e. "I have no choice but to be on the same side of this as the
Disney Corporation") but fluid and as categories _open to various
uses_. I do not think, for example, that "intellectual property" and
"copyright" need to be thought of as synonymous. Nor for that matter
is there necessarily a one to one link between "intellectual
property" and political "empowerment." Kali Tal very convincingly
argues how these two categories _can_ be seen as mutually dependent.
But there are also ways in which conditions of collective empowerment
might emerge as the result of a direct challenge and overturning of
normative assumptions of individual "intellectual property" (as well
as their accompanying legalistic reifications) -- where artistic
expression is placed at the service of strategic dispersals of
identity or provenance. In other words, I would reject the argument
that "empirically verifiable" authorial claim is some kind of
essential index of personal and political responsibility.

Which is all very intuitive and speculative in the grossest sense...
But I do think we need to be careful about treating this
identity/property attachment question as if it were a matter of
_principle_. We cut off our expressive options if we do, cut
ourselves off from thinking in the most various ways possible about
how we might work (work as a mode of critical intervention and
opposition) against deeply ritualized constructions of self and
otherness. And there may be times, there may be "topics" inside which
the pressing of otherness is such that conventional structures
of authorship and reception are simply not felt to be capacious
enough. But that's enough on that. I need to think more.

Now to answer Aldon. He said:

The letter from my contact in South America is a personal
communication, so I don't feel I can simply offer it up verbatim.
However, the "paraphrase" is a very accurate rendition of the
message the post contains. Unfortunately, I cannot say anything more
specific. I have my very strong suspicions about who some of the
people might be that have written the poet I was to edit the
anthology with, but in the end those can only stand as suspicions. I
wrote what I did in the hope that those involved might feel compelled
to come forward and explain to me why they feel I am unfit to
undertake such a project. They have not, and I take their
silence (because I _am_ certain that they know by now of this
discussion) to be either a sign of moral cowardice disguised as
arrogance, or else an indication that they may be reconsidering the
ethical implications of what they have done. At this point, I have
decided to not say anything more about it on the list unless they
wish to come forward to discuss it. I will say once again, however,
that what I personally suffer is the loss of a planned
sabbatical and the pleasure of collaborating with someone I admire.
And this is peanuts compared to those who are affected the most: the
poets and critics whose work richly deserves the exposure
this anthology would have helped provide.

Josh sd:
"I'm not ready to give up all the history and suggestivity of
"experimentalism".  The challenge is all the more interesting if one has
to recuperate such terms from interminable numbness."

I agree with Josh, though, like him as I read him in his post, I see
"experimental as a useful tag with some nice associations, rather than as
a method I want to place all my chips on.  Writers who've been important
to me have used it & believed in it for good reasons.  Here's John Dewey:
"The artist is born an experimenter because he has to express an intensely
individualized experience through means and materials that belong to the
common public world...Only because the artists operates experimentally
does he open new fields of experience and disclose new aspects and
qualities in familiar scenes and objects."  Now, Dewey presses on the
"intensely individual" a bit harder than I would, but I take his basic
point to be a good one: that the sense of experiment, of not knowing what
your doing before you do it b/c the culture has not give you the terms by
which you might do it, is basic to one's desire to change the language of
the culture and, by consequence, the culture itself.  Experiment, then, is
the method by which, to steal a formulation of Nate Mackey's, "individual
expression both reflects and redefines the collective, realigns, refracts
it."  That's a good thing, eh?    -m.

This makes sense.  I went to a bilingual reading by a young Russian poet
last night, Masha Aptek.  Once again I was highly impressed with the
Russian style, so diametrically opposed to "mainstream experimental"
U.S. tentativeness, ambiguity, open-endedness.  She sat in a chair
and recited from memory, looking directly at the audience in a fluid
milieu between speaking & chanting, the lines seeming (to a non-Russian
speaker) unrhymed but strongly marked rhythmically.  The impression
is one of total control & intellectual authority (whereas often a
poet in English can barely remember his or her own lines). Out of that
armature of certainty the poem itself becomes a form of shared play.

What this kind of control allows is an imaginative open-endedness.
The translated versions (which I could understand), revealed
a fluid style, a kind of "clear dreaming", accessible, but built
on intellectual leaps - both on the level of metaphors and
in the construction of the whole poem.

I suppose many on this list will want to say (1) western poets are
exploring incredible performance capabilities right now far beyond
the old stumbling over the shuffled pages, and (2) the kind of
traditional lyric described here is a thing of the past.
I'd rather not get into a retread argument over these issues -
just want to second Tom Bell's remarks by suggesting that older
techniques are not so easy to "master" & offer possibilities for such
fluid imaginative compounds that short poems are; I would also point
to Michael Heller's extremely subtle and discerning defense of the
lyric as a finished-unfinishable, unnacountable "occult" magnetic
object in last fall's CHICAGO REVIEW in connection with these
"out of date" techniques.  The idea that Dana Gioia & other popularizers
are beyond the pale - all those denizens of the powerful poetry
establishment here in whitish Mid America boring to one and all -
well, I may agree with that thread in principle, but to harp on
how distant we are from them sounds like a lot of old cows chewing
the cud - I started getting interested in poetry around 1962 (10 yrs old)
when I had to recite ee cummings' "in just- spring" out of an anthology
we were using called A GIFT OF WATERMELON PICKLE - I had trouble

You can add WS Burroughs to Spicer and others on the notion that language
isn't property. This idea runs throughout his work, and specifially in a
lecture he did at Naropa that was published in the 2 volume series.

or as WSB would say:

"DESTROY ALL DOGMATIC VERBAL SYSTEMS."

Maria,

I'm with you on the retention of copyright. I'd just like to share a quirky
little thing about publication that's going on in Canada right now.

"Canadian Literature" magazine, which used to welcome poetry between its
pages of academic abstracts, essays, and reviews, and even paid, which was
very welcome, is now insisting on retaining all copyright and all moral
rights, with no further consideration due the poet. To be fair, they will
allow writers to re-publish their work, free of charge in most cases, but
will bill the writers for enquiries. Mind you, that's not the point. The
point is that publication in "Canadian Literature" is now deemed to be so
prestigious that one would, presumably, be willing to abdicate copyright in
order to get in.

Presumably, this loss of copyright and corollary publication is equal in
value to the publication and $25/page the magazine paid until now.

In other words, a poet is paying the magazine $25 a page in order to
transfer copyright to the magazine.

Surely, the lowly poetics list is cheaper than that.

cheers,

Harold

I think this should be clear enough, right? it's certainly the allure
of the project =96 that beyond some really beautiful poems, there's
this tremendous edifice of thoroughly spurious authorship (and
thoroughness is definitely part of the effect, here); more than that,
masks on masks on masks, AY concealing Tosa Motokiyu, itself
a name (a noun) obscuring other, apparently numerous figures,
Ojiu Norinaga and Okura Kyojin, Kent Johnson, Javier Alvarez,
who knows who else =96 and who knows who for sure? more than
a deconstruction of authorship, the project casts a shadow over
the stability of the subject itself =96 hence the proliferation of
accusations that encompasses even commentators on the project,
rumors that x person isn't real or isn't who s/he claims to be =96
spurious rumors about spurious selves, and all of the above
dim in their origins, as these things go.

but there is the aspect =96 or possibly the spectre? =96 of this project,
that it's portrayal cuts in both directions. I.e., yes, I think it's
a very sophisticated =96 arguably the most sophisticated yet =96 action
against our reliance on the subject as a stable, discrete entity,
i.e. the molar subject (and one has only to be doing grad. school
applications to see how far our use of phi. and theory has taken us
from subjecting ourselves to these modes ha ha) =96 that is, "it's a
very good schizo dream". And yes it can also be taken up as a poke at
good old American anxiety over Hiroshima =96 a discomfort so well
deserved =96 , not to mention a generalized anxiety over ethnicity (or
the sometime academic game of Find the Subject Position) =96 etc. etc.
But on the other hand, Double Flowering really is haunted by the
subject in question =96 Araki Yasusada, Hiroshima survivor =96 , which
isn't just a comment on our terror and our crime, but has to be read
=95as=95 a question =96 an anxious question, and one I really can't answer=

=96 what does it mean to manufacture such a person? what does it
mean that Araki Yasusada is manufactured?

And, unlike some of the folks who've commented publically (i.e.,
who've published comments) on the work, I don't think these matters
are ultimately separable.


Bill Marsh wrottt:
> but the hasty lynching that other list members might be looking for seem=
s

I don't think anyone is calling for a hanging yet =96 but it's been
well and thoroughly discussed that that dynamic does seem to
be a part of the list functioning (another topic I'm not anxious
to get back to). I would like more information, certainly, and
perhaps I should be clear that my reaction in the previous
post is based on what information I have =96 it isn't meant as a
call to arms. Folks: no circling of wagons on my account, please.

Well (and others may also agree) I think that the best we can do here is offer
Kent our support and encouragement and then of course decry what has taken
place. The rest would perhaps be opinion and feelings that may or may not help
Kent in the least. I mean, for my part, that my opinion regarding the judgement
of Kent's South American collaborator may butt against Kent's respect for the
same person. Since when did it become possible to please everyone(critic or
not)? The letter seems vague and a bit hokey. I don't have enough information
to say this perhaps, but why is it necessary for Kent to "settle" his
"situation" with all of these wonderful secret friends of his here in the U.S.
BEFORE entering into this collaboration? Who are this collaborator's friends
anyway? 'nuff said.

I have of late appreciated Kent's postings for their spirit and freedom. He has
written in total (I feel) honesty and (yes) vulnerability. (This due to David
Bromige's proposal of which I am in total agreement--that it is still an active
and necessary aspect of poetry). His overall generosity and calm is well noted
on this list and he certainly doesn't deserve this crap.



Not feeling particularly well,

William Burmeister

>>Experiment, then, is
the method by which, to steal a formulation of Nate Mackey's, "individual
expression both reflects and redefines the collective, realigns, refracts
it." <<

That sounds a lot like the Great American Myth. It might be less relevent
for that small part of a few people's lives still protected from its reach
in remote corners of the globe. People well worth listening to.

Mind you, non-individual expression would do the same, wouldn't it? A group
expression, too? And which collective?

Brecht saying:

"The time of our leaders is ending fast.
The great won't stay great..."???

or the collective of his opponents...

"Once upon a time
our leaders gave us orders
to go out and conquer
the small town of Danzig,

so we invaded Poland
and with our tanks and bombers
conquered all of Poland
in a few days..."???

Speaking of collectives, perhaps someone could help me out here, with an
explanation of what was meant a few weeks back by the San Francisco poetry
wars.

I got real grouchy about that for a few weeks, because I had not considered
poetry a war, and have yet to see any evidence as to how a war is a
terribly good thing. Blame it on too many stories told to me when I was a
boy as my father tried to work out the horror of being bombed, starved, and
shot at from 1939-1945, when he was 6-12 years old, and the greater horror
of 50 million dead which led to that bombing, starving, and shooting. By
all accounts, Korea was pretty bad, too, Ypres unbearable, Vietnam a
disgusting display, and on and on and on.

My question is: what is so great about having a poetry war?

Heck, another question: is poetry a war?

I think I'm going to be hard to convince, given my prejudices against that
kind of behaviour, but I'd love it if someone could clear the air for me a
little.

Heinrich Boll said that it is easy to resist political totalitarianism,
because we have a strong tradition of resistance and it is consequently
easy to see where the line is drawn, but that it is supremely difficult to
resist material consumption because we have no knowledge of where to start
or what the line might even look like. He went on to say that such
resistance should be our political fight.

That doesn't sound like a war, though. That sounds like learning to see and
speak. Pretty basic stuff.

So, why on earth a war, let alone a poetic civil war?

That's not going to help anyone see, and it's not going to help anyone
speak. What possible constructive use would it serve?

The arguments over individualism, collectivism, community, tribalism,
subjectivity, objectivity, standards, tradition, experiment in poetry
seem to be inevitable since the individual/community question is
a political one, a moral one, a spiritual one, inescapable.  Shakespeare
wrote King Lear as a meditation on the transition from a feudal
corporate order to rapacious individualism; Melville wrote Moby
Dick partly as a response to Lear - to the same basic issues in a
new era.  When I look back over the "criticism" war of the past few
weeks, my own stance resembles that of Edmund, Lear's bastard :
or Ishmael at the beginning of the voyage : one against all, all
against all.  (Reagan's invisible hand of capitalism.)  That's
what "provocation" and raised temperature becomes (war).

However, I maintain that pure tribalism is no better than pure
individualism: it's full of just as much if not more illusory
constructs of solidarity and righteousness.  The individual who
takes pride and responsibility in unique work makes a space
for art in a democracy of equals.  This may be an illusion too
but I'd rather have a balance of illusions than one total illusion.
And critics, so it follows, have a right to "measure" quality
by their own language standards, moral standards, political
standards, personal taste, etc. - FREE of ulterior commitments.
It also follows that in a liberal democracy damned by private selfishness,
artists have a right to band together under common ideals and
create collective works of all kinds.  (I don't have to like them.)

It seems to me that poetry, as a kind of unmarketable commodity or
occult gift is in a special position to address a world in which
the market - the monetary value - becomes the global measurement
and the issue of how we govern ourselves & live together in civil
society - i.e. what binds us together BEYOND utilitarian or prudent
getting, spending and saving - becomes a very open question again.
The same question that tormented Shakespeare & Melville and...
This is true whether you are a socialist, a social democrat,
a liberal democrat, or a capitalist... (and it's not going to be
"resolved" in list-chat, either)...("ye shall judge them by their works").

This is partly what I meant when I said poetry - I mean poetry as
a perennial phenomenon - is not a subculture and should not be content
or assume marginality (not that marginality is all bad or the reverse
all good either...).

I want to voice public support for Kent Johnson in this bizarre and
heinous predicament and suggest, if it would do any earthly good at all,
that perhaps he - or we - organize a letter-writing campaign on his
behalf. I doubt if a letter from me to anyone would carry much weight,
but there are some on the list whose names do "carry weight" and who
have already publicly voiced their support for Kent in the form of
blurbs and lengthy defenses in articles. Although that could wind up
backfiring - I really have no idea. Perhaps it's not appropriate at all
- I guess only Kent would know.

But the sort of behavior being conducted against Kent - who certainly
strikes me as a good egg - is really intolerable - and just downright
childish.

I'd like to thank the numerous folks who have expressed support both
here and b-c. I want very much to not fall into the trap of playing
the martyr on this issue (a real temptation), but I'll allow myself
the sentimental luxury of saying that the expressions of solidarity
mean much to me, and particularly the fact that a few have come from
people I have fenced and quarrelled with on this space...

(OK, the hanky is now back in my pocket.)

I had said I would not say anything more about the issue. But I
received another letter from the poet this morning which is rather
stunning, and I am now considering translating it and making it
public. The letter evocatively shows how utterly manipulative this
whole thing has been, how badly  the poet feels about the matter, and
how shamefully those involved have taken advantage of the poet's
difficult situation to further their own agendas. The letter again
makes clear reference to unnamed people in the plural.

Unfortunately, the letter also makes clear that the project is
now done for. The poet feels there is no way out for him, and though
I wish he would change his mind, I am sympathetic to him. His
letter is both poignant and disturbing. And there are few times in my
life when I have felt as saddened and angry as I now feel.

I want to ask something very directly: A few weeks ago there was a
long and interesting thread which involved strong criticisms
of Marjorie Perloff for not giving enough space on her syllabus to
neglected visual poets. It has struck me as strange that some key
people involved in critiquing Perloff have said nothing about this
current issue, which involves the deliberate sabotage of a project
that meant, precisely, to bring attention to a large number of
neglected visual poets. So let me ask the entire "visual poetry
community": If what I have said about this affair is a candid and
faithful representation of events (I am asking you to simply consider
that hypothetically for now), what is your position? What, if
anything, do you know? Is there any light at all you could shed on
the problem? If you are someone, for example, who has had a
relationship with the poet in question (perhaps even published his
work) will you please tell me that you _don't_ know anything about
this?

A number of people have suggested that I directly ask the poet for
the identities of those involved, since knowing their names would
perhaps lead to a discussion that might facilitate resolution. But
the truth is, I don't feel it appropriate to press the poet to
"reveal names," for that could only further complicate his situation.
It is going to be up to those who have disgraced themselves to come
forward and explain. And as a matter of honor, I am going to persist
until I get to the bottom of what has happened.

As one of the "key people involved in critiquing Perloff" who has stayed
out of the controversy regarding Kent Johnson's being knocked out of a
project regarding South American visual poetry, I suppose I now have to
declare myself on the situation.  Otherwise, it would look like I was
one of the people he says plotted against him, or was in some way
involved.  Frankly, for many reasons, the main one having to do with my
personal life and not poetry-related at all, I haven't wanted to get
into another controversy just now.  But, if I have to, I have to.

1.  I was not involved in the anti-Kent plot, nor did I know anything
about it till his letter to this group.  (And I've been so busy I didn't
read it till I saw a reference to it in another letter.)  Nor have I
learned anything about it except what he has written.

2.  I'm in an awkward spot since I do know people who feel that Kent was
exploiting the South American poet he speaks of.  Whether they might
have expressed their doubts about Kent to the poet, I don't know.  I
can't believe they would have done more than that.  I myself have
nothing against Kent, and nothing against his participation in the
project he was setting up (and which I also know hardly a thing about).
But I don't want to start taking sides and perhaps alienating good
friends-- particularly when I have so little idea what's really going
on.

3.  It would be unfortunate if the project will never come to fruition
because of this kind of personality clash, or whatever it is.

4.  I wish Kent would learn to moderate his us/themism.

well about the only thing that can pull me out of this bronchial state i've
been in for a week solid now (another poet with a bug up his---) is to
express support for kent johnson and to say that i find his situation, on
the basis of what i know at this point, deplorable...

but while i'm here i'd like to add my name to the chorus of folks who've
argued that, if nothing else, it would be nice if subscribers were
contacted prior to having their posts published elsewhere... mself
personally, please feel free to spit out anything i say here anyplace
else---and if you can contact me first, thank you...

at the same time, i *do* want to go on record as saying that this medium
presents us with possibilities and problems that are new in many ways, and
that the issues at stake in copyright, reprint rights, intellectual
property rights, etc etc etc are messy and difficult and part & parcel of
the digital era, the challenges we face... that while, e.g, i support the
national writers' union wrt authors (freelancers say) getting paid for
electronic reprint of their work, there are other, knottier issues to
consider... i think mark amerika's column in the most recent _american book
review_ hits on some of these issues, if from an enthusiastically
pro-artistic pov (which i find mself sympathetic to generally)...

[insert six poems by t. s. eliot, and one by john ashbery]

i trust it's clear by these latter [brackets] what i mean to imply:  that
this medium permits us to do all manner of things quite easily that might
in fact not make a red [cough] cent... or a few red cents... and who here
is to say that this shouldn't be done? (just say so and i'll start typing
up, between coughs, poem after poem and posting it to this list, just to
prove my point; but it's been done here, no?---and what if THOSE posts were
published in print with poems intact?)... anyway, i'd hate to see us merely
duplicate print practices hereabouts (e.g., permission from the publisher
for a single LINE of poetry) w/o stopping to consider other possibilities
(in terms of social relations, material forms, even spiritual quests)...
steven harnad, e.g., has argued long and hard and controversially for a
more radically 'free' view of online scholarship (for a nice overview of
these and related issues, see doug brent's piece in the august, 1996,
_ejournal_ , volume 6, number 3---you can get it @
http://www.hanover.edu/philos/ejournal/archive/)...

in any case, that we should be discussing such stuff indicates a change, a
difference, of some significance... oh and some of you might wanna check
out the site on copyright, fair use etc. that george washington u grad
students have put up, at

http://www.nmjc.cc.nm.us/copyrightbay

and again---my main reason for jumping into the crosshairs to say that my
heart is with kent at the moment, based on what i know...

best,

David Z wrote to "correct" me about the workshops at the West Chester
Conference, but when I visited that site within the past hour what I find is
that the web site stillhas the 1997 conference details up, not the 1998
affair which I quoted direct from the brochure (I live about 10 miles from
there, which is how I get on the list). Keeping last year's data up on the
web site must be someof that spirit of innovation among the new formalists
that Finnegan was mentioning. Or maybe the idea of recycling the same
workshops year after year with the same roster of presenters moving from one
to another. "Make it same as last year," or however Pound put that.

I didn't say that the psychoanalytic institutes weren't possibly even a
gazillion times worse than, say, the worst university, I merely said that
they functioned outside of the university system as such and that that is
what helped to make Freud such a free floating signifier within the academy.
Ditto Marx's relation to the academy.

And while I do think every college should have at least one (and preferably
3 or 4) professors whose "field" is lit, and esp. poetry, post 1945, they
are not the ones responsible for the legitimation of poetry -- that lies
with the poets and they are for the most part not in the universities but in
various other places, coffee houses, art galleries, computer companies. Noah
Lissafoy, Mary Burger and Edmund Berrigan (and several thousand other folks
for whom these folks are examples) are responsible for the legitimation of
poetry today, not anyone on the faculties of Penn, Berkeley, Harvard,
Buffalo, Naropa or wherever. [Yeah, I know this is an overstatement and that
there are lots of good poets on campuses also, but I think it's important to
stress the dynamic, which is what counts.]

Bob, I can see why you could take that paragraph as possibly implying
that I suspected you had something to do with terminating this
project. I did not mean to imply that, and I apologize for not
phrasing things with more care. As you'll remember, we've posted
back-channel in a friendly spirit, and I hadn't at all thought of you
as someone who might have done something unethical. I was trying
to say, rather, that the issues involved here are obviously of
relevance to the concerns that informed that other discussion which
people jumped into so eagerly and vociferously. And, yes, I was
wondering why the premeditated squashing of a project promoting
visual poetics was not attracting more commentary form the vispo
scene. And I asked the questions I did because I assumed (and
rightly, as you have shown) that people in the vispo crowd know some
things that I don't yet know but which I am determined to find out
and clarify.

Well, apparently various communications from at least two persons
expressed "doubts" with a force sufficient to scuttle, practically
overnight, a very fraternal intellectual and professional
relationship.

Exactly the point. What is going on? And to hear that there are
people who feel that I was "exploiting" (!?) the person who had
agreed to co-edit the anthology with me is absolutely mind-boggling.
I will say to these people again: Why did none of you approach me
with these concerns about my harmful motives? Why did none of you
approach me to even inquire about the project and its aims? Do any
of you know me? This is absolutely incredible. Who are you? Have the
courage, for goodness sake, to come forward and tell me this and
explain why you feel I was engaged in exploiting somebody. How could
I have been exploiting a poet whose intellect and accomplishments far
overshadow my own? If anyone truly thinks I was "exploiting" this
poet because I had entered into a collaborative relationship with
him, they betray nothing but the most shallow and embarrassing
paternalism.

Yes, it is unfortunate that the project has been ruined and will not
come to fruition. But what "personality clash"? I don't believe I've
ever even met any of those involved. Or am I wrong? Do me a favor,
Bob, and I ask this sincerely: Tell your "good friends" that I would
greatly appreciate it if they would be so decent as to introduce
themselves to me.

I think it is a supposition that what occured had anything to do
with the Yas jazz (something that does seem to get itself talked -
or wriiten - about ad infinitum).  If I were to be thinking along
this line I could think of a lot of reasons a person or group of
people might want to do me dirty, reasons that have no connection
with the "authorship" of any poem.

Even though this is becoming one of those things I wrote about in a post
a couple of days ago, I feel I need say a few things here.

1. I feel like I'm back in he climate of the late Joe McCarthy - turn in
your friends and stand up and fight or you're a Red.

2.  I need to say again and probably more directly what I said earlier,
possibly to obliquely.  I have in the past corresponded with the poor
poet in question.  One of the things he said and that I included in that
earlier post was that he would be interested in joining this list but
uncomfortable doing so because of his lack of confidence in his command
of English.  Please leave the poor man and his reputation out of this!
He's uncomfortable with the shifting sands here.  I am only posting
this without clearing it with him beforehand because this has become
so convoluted and so subjet to misinterpretation that I don't think I
could even explain it to someone who is confident in his/her understanding
of English.
In the best of worlds though I would think that this post of mine would
most appropriately be cleared by him.  I think the problems that seem to
have arisen here are a reflection on earlier comments on this list
regarding the legality/advisibility of releasing/printing/posting
material without prior consent.

3.  I do support in principle protests against what apparently happened
to Kent Johnson but really do need to know more about what did or did
not happen.

4.  I do not now nor have I ever had any contact with anyone who may have
ever said, written, or emailed anything negative (or positive for that
matter) about Kent Johnson.  I also never have or do I intend to say, write,
or email anything about Kent Johnson to anyone.

5.  This problem (along with the "Perloff/vispo poets" affair and
other affairs) is beginning to become an issue of literary reputation
or sensation.  This is problematic for me as I think it obscures real
and important issues that are at stake.  In this instance I think the
issue of fairness is being swamped by concerns with personality and
literary reputation. I think a thoughtful reading of what was posted
(and is in the archives) in the Perloff/vispo thing will reveal that
what was/is at stake were some real issues related to quality, knowledge,
and experience.  It was not merely an imbrolio over personality and
literary reputation.  I would hope that the same is true of the Yaz
affair.

Hope this doesn't entangle things further.

Tom:

Are you implying that I am asking people to turn in their friends?
When have I said this? What I have asked for, numerous times and
very plainly, is that those who involved themselves in writing
about me to my collaborator step forward _of their own accord_ and
do me the simple courtesy of explaining their actions. In what sense
does this have anything to do with McCarthyism?? Unless I am grossly
misunderstanding your intent, you have got this very backwards:
It seems that there have been, in some form and degree, a certain
number of defamatory things said about me without my having the
opportunity to know what was said and who said it. It's this that is
akin to the spirit of McCarthyism, and it is precisely why this is an
issue of importance, one that goes beyond, as you would have it,
matters of "personality."

Could you please be yet _less_ oblique here? What exactly does
English have to do with this? That I have possibly misunderstood him?
All of our communication has been in Spanish. Or are you saying that
he has misunderstood the English of what was written to him by others
about me? If this is the case, I ask again--please simply come
forward back-channel and clarify what was lost in translation. And
what is this about the "poor man" and "poor poet"? "Poor" how?
Helpless? Childlike? What on earth do you mean? When you use
modifiers like that you don't do much for (as you say) "his
reputation," which you ask that I (I think you're talking about me)
leave out of this. But anyway--where have I said anything that has
compromised his reputation? Have I? You mention McCarthyism--reading
your post I feel like I'm a charachter in _1984_.

Tom: I speak fluent English and Spanish. How about if you post me
back-channel and try to explain it to me? I will be very patient and
listen intently. If you stumble, you can start over again as many
times as you want. I have been waiting very patiently (well, sort of)
for some one to explain it to me! It has been an interesting thing to
be patient in a circumstance like this, when you're more or less
looking like a goddamned fool two days before your tenure approval
hearing and you start hearing that, well, this is all just a matter
of personality--mainly a matter of the personality of someone who
wanted to "exploit" a "poor" poet from South America.

Hello Tom. Just what do you think I've been trying to do? Write
me b-c if you want and let's see if we can't work together to help
clear this up. I have two letters in my hand. They very clearly say
(in Spanish) that persons known to the poet have sent him various
communications "questioning" his relationship with me and placing him
in an "embarrassing position." These letters also say other things,

Yes, Kent I think you're right, this appears to have escalated and it's
getting complicated and we're not communicating well.  I can see where
I conributed to the confusion in some ways.  I agree that it is best
we go off list regarding this and then come back soon with evidence
we've cleared it up.  At that point we can bring our ruminations back
for the others if there is interest and need.

>>Experiment, then, is
the method by which, to steal a formulation of Nate Mackey's, "individual
expression both reflects and redefines the collective, realigns, refracts
it." <<

That sounds a lot like the Great American Myth. It might be less relevent
for that small part of a few people's lives still protected from its reach
in remote corners of the globe. People well worth listening to.

Mind you, non-individual expression would do the same, wouldn't it? A
group
expression, too? And which collective?"

Well, Mackey might say that if it sounds like the "Great American Myth" -
and I'm guessing the myth you're talking about is the myth of some form of
"rugged individualism," etc, though I must say its a rather tired
critique of something as subtle as Mackey's formulation, a kind of
catch-all - its only insofar as that myth(s) has been influenced by those
formerly "remote corners of the globe" you mention, West Africa for
instance.  The individual *reflects* the collective every bit as much as
she helps to realign it.  Behind this formulation too is Mackey's interest
in jazz, an Ellisonian model of that art form, where the soloist is placed
in the paradoxical position of always playing "both with and against the
group."  Does "Great American" suffice as a tag for that equation?  As a
description of a particular kind of social dynamic I'm sure some of us
could find equivalents in other "corners of the globe."  -m.

Sure it suffices. Sure, there are equivalents in other parts of the world.
Nonetheless, since these are just descriptions of behaviour, why should
such descriptions not be an American lens? It seems to me entirely logical
that an American would have certain predisposed ways of seeing, based upon
certain notions of the relationship of the individual to the group. Why
not? Wouldn't a Hungarian? Besides, isn't the American myth culturally
dominant throughout the world, anyway? Isn't that what Disneyland and
Hollywood have been doing all these years? Isn't that what Clinton and Iraq
are all about? When the terms of discourse are set by a certain lens, it is
not surprising that they turn up complementary material, because other
material will be outside of the lens, or grammar, set by the discourse. Am
I missing something?

Saddam on the Move for Security Reasons

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Fearing an American air attack, Saddam Hussein
has reverted to the furtive lifestyle he maintained in the Gulf War,
moving from house to house and employing decoys and disguises, The New
York Times reported Sunday.   . . .

According to the Times, Hussein often sends out presidential convoys
of cars as decoys, then dresses as a Beduoin and drives another car
himself.

He also stays overnight at random ordinary Iraqi households, the Times
said. The newspaper reported that his hosts will not know of the visit
until a member of his Special Guard, his security force, knocks on
their door to announce: "You have a guest tonight."  . . .

Nice to see a review of Ilya Kutik's Ode on Visiting the Belasoraisk Spit on
the Sea of Azov, a really wonderful work and wonderful translation, in the
new issue of Non. No mention of Ilya's winning the gold for figure skating,
tho.

Non, like Jacket and a few other venues hereabouts, is showing what the WWW
can really do vis a vis alternative publishing. Totally great effort.

Warren Spahn pitched so long in the majors that his first manager (1942
Boston Braves) was also his last (1965 NY Mets), Casey Stengel. Close
readers here will recall that Stengel was an early version of Jack Spandrift
(and may indeed _be_ Jack Spandrift, which would explain a lot). Spahn
coached in Japan (!) and Mexico apparently before heading back to the mound
in Mexico, which actually delayed his entrance in the Hall o' Fame by 3
years. The man did indeed lose 3 years to WW2 (and got a purple heart after
being shrapneled on the Rhine), won 267 games before he pitched his first
no-hitter (his second came at the age of 41) and did one thing no active
pitcher will ever come close to: he hit 35 home runs. If you never saw his
high leg kick (nor the righty cloned version Juan Marichal still says cut
his career short), you have no idea how beautiful baseball as a sport can
be. Spicer coulda told you,

I understand your point Harold, but I guess if you're missing someting its
the fact that neither Hollywood or Disneyland has ever embraced anything
even remotely resembling a model of cultural practice based on jazz
ensemble collaboration and the endless improvisation of individual and
collective identity.  My God, I wish they would! -m.


According to Harold Rhenisch:

The editors of the William Blake Archive
<http://www.iath.virginia.edu/blake/> are pleased to announce the
publication of an electronic edition of _Songs of Innocence and of
Experience_, copy Z. It joins editions of three copies of _The Book of Thel_
and two copies of _Visions of the Daughters of Albion_. In the coming week,
these works will be joined by _The Marriage of Heaven and Hell_, copy D,
_The Book of Urizen_, copy G, _America, a Prophecy_, copy E, and _Europe, a
Prophecy_, copy  B. All of these editions have newly edited texts and were
scanned from 4x5 color transparencies made specifically for the Archive.
They are all fully searchable for both text and images and are supported by
the unique Inote and ImageSizer applications described in our previous updates.

_Urizen_ copy G and _Songs_ copy Z were produced in Blake's late printing
and coloring styles, c. 1818 and c. 1826 respectively. _America_ copy E is a
monochrome copy from 1793; _Europe_ copy B was color printed in 1794, and
_Marriage_ copy D was produced in 1795 on large paper and with some
rudimentary color printing.

We will be adding second and third copies of most illuminated books in the
coming months, with the goal of having the entire illuminated canon online
later this year. In addition, work continues on the SGML edition of David V.
Erdman's _Complete Poetry and Prose of William Blake_, which we anticipate
releasing sometime this spring.

        As probably the only person on this list who has actually been to
the West Chester conference--in fact,I've been each of the three years
since it started--I can say that yes, Ron, there really is much to be
gained from the sessions, particularly the panels, which often include
graduate students doing refreshingly noncategorizable work. I'll be
including some of these essays in a forthcoming collection, New Formal
Poetics, which also includes essays by some on this list (and if you have
something you think would be of interest on "form," send it along; there
may still be room to squeeze something in, and Armand, I'll get back to you
soon).  In this book I am trying to bridge some of the abysses between
those who care about "form" on both sides of the spectrum.
        In fact,West Chester may be the only conference devoted to poetry
except for the Orono conference that is serious enough to include critical
panels as well as readings--somebody correct me if I'm wrong.  But there is
no money of any kind, state or otherwise, for it, let alone open bars; all
the workshop leaders are doing it for a pittance and manyof them choose to
do it for free because the conference has yet to break even.  The fact that
the organizers keep asking the same people over and over has a a lot to do
with their embarrassment over asking people they don't know to read or
teach for the miniscule fees they can offer (the first year I was a
workshop leader and taught 5 days, did a reading and a panel, for $200 plus
room and board--the only reason I didn't do it for free is because I was so
in debt at the time.  I think it's a little more now but I am almost
positive that at least half the workshop leaders are still doing it for
free, out of their sense of dedication).
        The reason all these people are willing to do this is only for love
of imploding form (thanks, whoever brought that term in--was it Harold?);
because they know this is the only place a poet could be among people who
care/know about traditional prosody, with whom one can discuss scansion,
new prosodic systems, metrical variation, linguistic theories of prosody,
etc.. This stuff is complicated, believe it or not, and it's hard to find
people who have the patience for it.  The passion for "form" in this sense
is an addiction like the exploration of any other fertile aesthetic avenue.

        Nonetheless, involvement in this conference has been an intense
strain for me as well, for various aesthetic and political reasons that
will be all too clear to those on this list.  There has been some
change--Marilyn Nelson, for instance, is a wonderful addition to the
faculty, for whose invitation I am happy to take initial credit.   But it's
been maddening.  Every movement has its battles, but trying to radicalize
and diversify new formalism ---aesthetically and politically--has really
been an almost overwhelming challenge for those of us who have been
involved in it (and no, don't hit that R key just yet; really, radicalizing
and diversifying new formalism is NOT an oxymoron.  Just think about it a
minute.).
        My own continued involvement is questionable right now.  If those
of us on the fringes can succeed in intensely altering the agenda of the
conference in the next year or two, it could become a uniquely valuable
forum for serious discussion of  both traditional and exploratory poetics.
I would like to see the conference adopt a solid commitment to
multicultural poetic forms as well as to exploded form in all its senses,
without giving up its initial commitment to traditional English-language
prosodies.  Are you laughing?  Probably you should be, because that sounds
like a ludicrous hope to me too.  But what's a radical formalist to do
nowadays?  Where does our community lie?  It's all form, after all. I'm
going to go make some phone calls. If anyone on this list (talk is cheap,
Ron) would like to be on a panel on exploratory form at West Chester this
year (Philly area, June 10-13), please backchannel me ASAP (Ron??). If I
can do something interesting this year, I might go to the conference again.

They pretend to, and the pretense becomes the message.

They'd be bound to screw it up somehow.

Still, I just meant to say that even jazz ensemble collaboration is an
American practice (no value judgement intended), but you're right, it's the
positive side.

I have received a number of complaints about the tone of some recent post
on this list. Here is the most recent (I have chosen to withhold the name
of the writer for reasons explained in the note):

Perhaps as a member of this virtual assembly, if not yet community, it's
time for me to note that the kind of post being cited here degrades the
possibilities for free and open exchange on this list insofar as it may
work to silence others. At a certain point, confronted with the charge that
*this* community is at fault, it may be the case that we are at fault if no
response is made to this, especially as in this case where it comes in a
message trivializing the reasonable concerns of other members of this list
that their work, as posted on this list or elsewhere, not be reprinted
without their permission.
        I recognize, and moreover, appreciate, the need for boisterous and
impolitic language in the kind of free and open exchanges on this list. I
am not setting up a hard and fast rule on this issue and will not. However,
as stated in the Poetics Welcome message, this is a moderated list and it
will be moderated in keeping with the primary goals of the project. Other
lists will of course establish different parameters. In this instance, all
that I am asking for is consideration of these concerns.

As one who has been pretty sarcastic on this list - and who has received
slights in return - I recognize the temptation to use vituperation and
satire in a creative way - to make a point, to provoke others, to add
a certain kind of interest (interesting to some, probably just annoying
to many). I've fallen for it many a time.

I have 2 responses to Charles' message.  First, I would hate to see this
list censored in any way.  Second, I hope I will keep this word to the wise
in mind and hope others will too.  We should treat each other with
respect.

Why am I responding to CB's message?  I've been following world news, including
articles on the level of abuse people are subjected to in political discourse
in Israel at present.  The head of the Knesset warned his fellow
politicians: "words can kill".  There is no reason this list has to imitate
the worst in talk radio. Spandrift may be Eric Blarnes' hero, but he
takes off his chaps & spurs to use the outhouse just like the rest of us.

Some people may find it hypocritical for me to be voicing these sentiments.
Well, I've been thinking about it.  Call me on it if I forget myselves.
At the same time, just as words can kill, it's also true that the truth
hurts.  Then again, however: "judge not lest ye be judged."

Actually the memory of Spahnie's long pickoff move - the best there will ever
be is what sticks in my mind - I can still see the graceful arm and quick
whip snap that haunted runners for years.  Actually it's a visceral memory,
one that I rehearsed every evening for several years albeit from the starboard
side (?is this the equivalent for port's opposite in this case).

Somewhat more seriously? On the other sport note, this is the second recent
note here on Current Russian/slavic verse.  I would appreciate info on
availability of current russian verse (particularly www refs).  I asked this
once several years ago here and got a wealthof responses, but I'm sure other
things have appeared.  I live in a small town with no close University
library access and am often starved for current info in many areas.

p.s., Spahnie also played a mean banjo with another manager, Cholley Grimm.

But of course it is not. The poetry published in the magazine is pretty bad
stuff, mainly creative writing poems, short descriptive pieces that I
cannot believe anyone but the authors reads.

I'm with Charles and that other who mentioned we should all wear high heels
when we're responding. Keep in mind in these contagious times, spit carries
the flu and the flu doesn't stop at you, take your pills before it spills
into our brains and then our lovers brains and how far is the infants
choochoo trains?
i feel for Kent but at the same time my sypathy strains harder to reach the
person being eligible for a sabbatical and another who's stretching 5-6000
a year, there's heartbreak and hartebrake. i want to see those whines
distilled to songs, to blues perhaps, one day the list will have a sound
track, we'll all write to the accompaniment of Carl Orff and feel humble or
exalted, powerful seats of response. Bitterness does not further. Save your
strength for new creation, stimulate me, the poet citizens responsibility,
there's enough that brings us down already. Consolation is what we want for
the Israelis and Palestinians, consolation we seek for the iraqis and the
yanks, consolation we need to admit in own relations. Consolation not
conflagration. If only there were a madison ave of the left, me and
mayakovsky we'd be millionaires.

For what it's worth, when I told Tom I'd be grateful to him for

In any case, the misunderstanding is not Tom's fault, whose

Welcome to NOISE News #7.
This issue contains the call for submissions to p e r f o r a t i o n s
17. The guest editor for this issue is Alan Sondheim.

As always, we are especially looking for form/content explorations which
use emergent technologies such as hypertext, in vital and innovative ways,
as well as essays and reviews. Also, we consider these issues as
'nodes' for research and ongoing activity, so they are occasionally udated
or articles added. However we DO like to start compiling initial material
as soon as possible.

Previous nodes may be viewed from the Public Domain page at: www.pd.org

The call for P18 on the theme of Post-Feminist Art, guest editor Monika
Weiss,  will be issued shortly.

For more information contact:
 sondheim@gol.com,
 zeug@pd.org, or
 monika@pd.org

Public Domain, Inc. will also be issuing a CD of sonic explorations at the
end of March to be entitled VEIL. We'll put up a sample on the Performance
page at some point. For more information: info@pd.org
----------------------------------------------------------------
                          ILLEGIBILITY

An assumption of this century, Foucault's analysis of _divinatio_ not-
withstanding, is that the world is becoming increasingly legible -
that there are one or more _readings_ of the world - either through
the foreclosing of textuality (what is, can be said), or through an
increased understanding aligned with progress and progressivity. If
the world is an encoding, then decipherment continues to reduce the
unknown, and this might even be measured in terms of bandwidth, toler-
ances, and so forth.

On the other hand, one might argue towards an essential and irreduci-
ble _illegibility,_ that not everything is decipherable - that there
may, perhaps, be unknown or unknowable signs - as well as phenomena
masquerading as signs - as well as phenomena having no relation to the
symbolic at all.

This is not an arguement for a "horizon" of the illegible, but a seepage
that occurs perhaps _within_ as well as without the legible. (For example,
it may not be the case that every culture can be traced or translated -
even in part - into every other.) Perhaps every domain is inherently
illegible; perhaps foundations are not always interpretable across the
board (and there for are not foundations sub specie aeternis). Consi- der
the illegibility and illiteracy of the world, and consider the following,
somewhat practical, concerns. (Any other related concerns, of course,
would do as well.)

0 Issues of identity, recognition, self-reflexivity / asservation: To
what extent does identity depend on legibility? Can one "read" another
culture (without or without literacy in that culture) in such a manner
that anomie or the sensation of exile do not occur? Can one "read"
one's own culture in this manner? What is the phenmenology of anomie?
Of exile?

1 Illiteracy - the inability to read and write. Every text is illegi-
ble. (But if one is literate in the language of a text, and the text
is visually "clear," does that _necessarily_ mean it is legible?)
What is the post-Ivan Illich "take" on language, reading and writing?

2 Computer illiteracy - the inability to use computer technology. (Are
computers legible _all the way down_? What constitutes legibility in
this case?) What is the political economy of computer technology? Of
computer-mediated-communication (CMC) in relation to this? (Think of
the division between haves and have-nots for example. What - today -
constitutes _having_? Is bandwidth a consideration?)

3 Dead Media (Bruce Sterling) - illegible remnants, archeologies.
(What constitutes "media" in the first place?)

4 Infinite _kanji_ - wandering across a Borgesian world in which uni-
versals do not exist, in which each signified (in the sense of refer-
ence in the world) possesses its own sign. Nothing and everything are
simultaneously interpretable in writing. All signs are illegible and
legible; all are strictly indexical, ikonic, blurring the distinction.

5 Illegibility of or on or off the Net: What constitutes Internet
illegibility; what constitutes Net illiteracy? Do TCP/IP and other
protocols play a role here? Since virtual subjectivity is largely
textual (or entirely textual, if bit-mapping is considered as such),
what would be an _illegible subject_? What sorts of reception theory
apply here?

6 Are cultures translatable? Is habitus a discourse or discursive for-
mation? What is the political economy of legibility, of illegibility?

7 What constitutes misrecognition? How does misrecognition play into
the above? (Misrecognition: an alternative or alternative reading, a
non-intended reading, a reading-degree-zero, an absent or absent-mind-
ed reading.)

8 Reading and writing "foreign" cultures or the cultures of one's own.
Reading and writing on the Net.

9 And finally, to what extent is illegibility _inherent_ in the world
at large? And what constitutes this inherency?

It's a shame, and damned distressing, to see what Kent is going through.  I am
thankful though for Tom Bell's recent posts that help shed some light on the
affair and that will hopefully increase sympathy for Kent's unfortunate
position.  Unlike Kent, however, I seriously doubt that anyone will admit
their guilt in this sabotage.  But their silence can be revealling...

Mr. Bernstein, I'm sure you know those who backchanneled you did so not out
of fear of making posts to a list with the likes of impolite me, but because
they disagree with what I say and they detest my uncouth postal tones.  This
proves they lack a sense of humor and that posts in Cyberville must be
drained of emotion in order to survive.  The post in question actually *did*
what I wanted it to do (a language act?):  it facilitated discussion about
Kent's doomed project.  It was definitely an in-your-face, over-the-top
statement.  But it worked better than if I had written in polite measure, 'Oh,
pretty please, someone help poor Kent Johnson..."

Ultimately, this is about dissent.  I keep returning to this, but it's true.
The high ideals of this community are often exposed as shams, as the Kent
Johnson affair suggests.  Those who oppose me dislike that I point out their
hypocrisy.  The only way to prevent me from doing that is to turn me off.

But I will consider your actually very generous post.  And I will swallow my
impulse to tell you to go screw yourself, out of respect for your role on this
list, and out of respect for all you've done for this great art of poetry.

Dale, I don't see how the 2nd part of your last sentence is evidence of the
assertion in the 1st part.  My guess is that the large majority of people
on this list are like me: they haven't followed the Yasusada "affair",
they know neither Kent, the poet in South America, nor Kent's hidden
antagonists, and they are in no position to take a position on this.
This may indeed show the limitations of this "community" in terms of its
ability to either support or oppose Kent; but nobody ever claimed, in a
"shamful" way, that this was an advocacy organization. If what Kent says is
true about people maliciously meddling in his own projects, this is a shame.
But if I were Kent I would be in close conversation with the South American
guy to try and determine the exact nature of the accusations & qualms in order
to lay them to rest, as well as garner letters of support & confidence
in order to turn it around.  If I were the South American guy I wouldn't give
much weight to "Kent is all right" letters from people (like me) completely
out of that loop.  If there are people "in the loop" who want to support
Kent, I presume they have already backchanneled him in this regard.
What gives you the right to cast aspersions on the list for not jumping
blindly on this particular bandwagon?  Are you suggesting that because
a few people on this list may be backstabbing jerks, then the whole list
is to blame?  It may be that Kent has been victimized by some "powerful"
people in the "poetry world"; this is a possibility; in which case everybody's
continued participation in that world on those terms shares some blame.
But the case has to be made, first.  - Henry Gould

A couple of thoughts on this: Dale excused himself in this post,
complimented Charles Bernstein, and essentially dismissed the person who
felt silenced by his post attitude. Rather a hierarchical response. I
would encourage the person who posted to Charles to try to feel free to
write to the list. I think incivility (and no matter how cleverly
composed) is seen by 99.9% of the list as exactly what it is: lack of
self control.

As regards the efficacy of Dale's post regarding Kent's issues: I think
he is being self-serving in seeing his post as having facilitated
conversation. My mail delivered responses that preceded his, and by that
time I had already back-channeled Kent, as I imagine others had.

Again, though, I'd like to point out that most of the posts to the list
come from a relatively small percentage of subscribers: perhaps we
should try to be more welcoming of other thoughts/discourses. I'm sure
there are plenty of people out there with thoughts they are reluctant to
share because they are not consistent with the list's usual tone.
Unfortunately, I imagine may of these people are women. Please, anyone
who wants to speak up, do. You'll find most of the responses you receive
to be gracious and well-considered (much of this does tend to occur
back-channel, so the list isn't always a good indicator of response). I
for one would love to see more "thought" (vs. composed exhortation).

Dale, I'd like to say in front of the List that while I did b-c Charles B
for clarification re-policy on pirate-publishing Listpostings, _I_ did not
urge him to debar you; not for that, nor for your uncouth postal tones, nor
your views, although I have been in opposition to them.

 Because I have been among those who have been addressed in uncouth terms
by you, and whose views have been held in contempt by you, I feel it
necessary to make this statement.

While I did say, on the List, that I was surprised you put up with a List
composed largely of academics, a body of persons you are inclined to revile
on a bad day, I was not "wishing you off the list" (as someone who likes
you, said to me b-c). I note that your tone has modulated of late, and
where there's life, there's hope. I dont think _dissent_ is the problem;
it's the rudeness and the prejudices. db 3

An assemblyman was strolling the grounds
Beside the northern building of the state senate
Walking past the antique roses looking at them
And smelling them. The bees and the beetles
Were the only other ones there this afternoon
So close to the end of the spring term.
Pulling a whitish pink just-opened bud close and drawing
The sour-deep rose scent into his face
He coughed and saw with his third eye
A pleasant scene of life in his district.

The quote comes from Eliot's essay "Philip Massinger", and runs as follows:
"Immature poets imitate; mature poets steal; bad poets deface what they take,
and good poets make it into something better, or at least different."

A great indie-critic comment.  But then, Eliot was always promoting himself,
even here: the anagram of his name is "stole it".

Subject:      Lacan on Poetry
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

Nick Piombino expressed interest in a post last week regarding the
reputation of psychoanalysis among poets.

Lacan was questioned (I paraphrase throughout my note here from an issue of
OCTOBER that featured a translation of a television broadcast that Lacan did
in the Seventies) regarding one of his core ideas -- "the unconscious is
structured like a language" -- What do you do with anything that doesn't get
mixed up with words? What of psychic energy, or affect, or the drives?"

Lacan answered in line with tradition (Galileo, Newton) that energy is
nothing other than the numerical value of a constant that allows physicists
to do their work. The unconscious isn't something to be numerically
expressed, but to be deciphered. You can't verify a so called "life force"
(a crude metaphor for energy used by some) as anything other than
representation.

Affect, Lacan continued, is a discharge of adrenalin that is also a
discharge of thought, and therefore displaced, and therefore metonymic.

He went on to designate poetry, specifically Dante, as a prime example of
this process, which begins with Plato and early Christian efforts at
subsectioning the passions of the soul on the model of the body, where
sadness (depression) isn't merely a state of the soul, but something which
is "located only in relation to thought, that is, in the duty to be
well-spoken, to find one's way in dealing with the unconscious, with the
structure."

In contrast, Lacan offers a reference to *gai savoir* (gay science) an
expression the Provencal troubadours used to designate their poetry, as a
happy-go-lucky enjoyment of deciphering -- happy without suspecting what
reduces you to a dependence on language. The poet's moodiness (or whatever
you want to call it) would be his or her relationship to the real via this
dependence, the manifestation of ideas that are forceful enough for you to
feel exiled from them.

Lacan concludes, borrowing from Heidegger: "Affect, therefore, befalls a
body whose essence it is said is to dwell in language."

Heidegger wrote in his "Letter on Humanism": "Only from this dwelling 'has'
he 'language' as the home that preserves the ecstatic for his essence. [...]
Language is at once the house of Being and the home of human beings."

First I'd like to say that I welcome any and all voices to contribute to this

I think that if it's lacking here then it's for reason other than my posts.
But obviously, others take a different view.

I'm curious as to why the Vizpo folks aren't saying more about the travestythat
has taken place.  Or, I should say *may* have taken place.  Since the only way
to prove Kent right in this is to have the perpetrators of the crime turn
themselves in.  Regardless, the really sad thing about this is that many poets
in Latin America are going to be silenced in this country.  They are the ones
truly victimized by the halting of this project.  Is there nothing to say?  A
few weeks ago Vizpo was all the rage.  Where did all that enthusiasm go?  Does
this not interest anyone?  A potentially valuable project is sunk now.  What
a drag.  But Veezpo is safe in the USA...

A great indie-critic comment.  But then, Eliot was always promoting
himself, even here: the anagram of his name is "stole it".<<<

It's also "toilets," which influenced the famous Creedence Clearwater
Revival lyric:

        Don't go out tonight, it's bound to take your life
        There's a bathroom on the right.

As a lurker and sometimes contributor to this list, I am deeply puzzled
about this Ken/South American/poet mafia stuff.

1) Wouldn't all this be cleared if Ken just wrote to his friend in South
America, find out who is/are saying these bad things about him.  Then after
finding out write to these/the people/persons and asking what the problem
is.  I know this seems rather simplistic, but wouldn't that solve the
problem more than having this moral outing of someone(s) who may subscribe
to the list.

For all I know this South American Poet may be insane, Ken maybe insane,and
the entire Poet Mafia maybe insane also.  Or they can all be totally sane,
and there
is a conspiracy.  But then again, instead of asking point blank for someone
to come clean on the list, it is best just to communcate with the poet and
see who is behind it.

And then third, why would a third party be concerned about another's
project?  I am sorry, but none of this makes sense to me.

Hey, the last part of this is the epigraph to my article, "Desire Pronounced
and/ Punctuated: Lacan and the Fate of the Poetic Subject," which appeared
in American Imago 52.4 (Winter 1995), an article that's pertinent to this
thread (tho it deals mainly with "official verse culture").

Also of interest: _Rhetoric and Culture in Lacan_, by Gilbert D. Chaitin
(Cambridge UP, 1996), the only book in English, as far as I know, to deal
extensively with Lacan's theory of poetry.

One of the problems with the thought of Freud and those descended from him
is that they accept as fact without question a set of assumptions for which
there is no empirical evidence. The unconscious as a separate realm, for
instance, is a necessary construct only for those who like Freud derive
their theory of the psyche from Wagnerian romanticism, although it is a
pretty idea. But there is no reason to suppose that it exists in nature (as
opposed to the obvious existence of processes and impulses of which we are
unconscious).
Here's a few more such:
the Oedipus "complex" and its universality
Freudian developmental theory
penis envy
the neutrality of the analyst.

Robert Hale wrote, in part:

Lacan answered in line with tradition (Galileo, Newton) that energy is
nothing other than the numerical value of a constant that allows
physicists to do their work. The unconscious isn't something to be
numerically expressed, but to be deciphered. You can't verify a so
called "life force" (a crude metaphor for energy used by some) as
anything other than representation.

Affect, Lacan continued, is a discharge of adrenalin that is also a
discharge of thought, and therefore displaced, and therefore metonymic.

Talk about metonymic! But metonymic for what? For I? For another
metonymy? Does Lacan perform an Indian Rope Trick here, hauling up the
chain of signifiers behind him into a tiny cloud, which then burns off
in the sunlight? Does the "poem" read itself, or does identity proceed
automatically, metronomically? But that might imply a kind of not-yet-
discovered quantity, as if the writing of the poem occurred by the
accretion of a series of numbers not yet discovered as a series, no?
With what sort of confidence does Lacan write off the possibility of a
numerical character of the unconscious, yet call in the same breath for
its de*cipher*ment, especially since he hees himself as subject in the
process of "being written"? Who runs these 'numbers' down on Jacques
Lacan? Who sits in on the renga?

It's always been my experience that those who have had no significant contact
with psychoanalysis are those who, like Katy Lederer earlier, and Mark Weiss
now, are most inclined to dismiss Freudian experience; and usually when this
fact is pointed out, it tends to be dismissed as an unreasonable imposition.
Yet the experience of analysis is where the empircal evidence is found that
Mark Weiss claims doesn't exist.  To say that J. Lacan and others "accept as
fact without question a set of assumptions for which there is no empirical
evidence.", is astonishingly smug; all, or nearly all analysts since Freud
are/have been so stupid and so dishonest as to ignore both their professional
and personal integrety so as to "perpetuate their theory of the psyche
[derived] from Wagnerian romanticism".  There have been many attempts --all of
them futile, I believe -- to impliate Freud in the works of others, but I
think that this is the least imaginative that I've heard or read.  But then I
belong to that school which teaches that one should know something before
speaking about it, and then only speaking to that which is supported by one's
experience.

It's not my intent to be Freud's defender on this list, although anyone who
wants to chat about it can back-channel me at JBCM2.aol.com.

That's an interesting concept: "silencing" the "visual" poets. Hmmm.

I dont see a problem in talking about experimental poetry, as long as what
you are doing redembles the procedure in experiments you did in Chem
classes in highschool. And as long as you remember that most experiments
fail.

Dear CharlesB & List,

I agree in general with the tenor of your message (and that of the
whiner(s)) that people should not be "mean" to each other -- so yes indeed
I think Norman Fischer's definition of emptiness on the non channel is in
need of review:

"Three attitudes arise as a consequence of the appreciation of emptiness:

flexibility - since nothing is real, fixed, separate, or able to be
possessed resistance is self-defeating

kindness - since everything is nothing but connection kindness is natural

humility - who is going to feel like he's master of all this talk?"

So . . .  Bad Dale!  (&! anyone! else! who! hasn't! reached! enlightenment!)!
Go get empty!  However, I would like to debuke the writer
of the complaint for lacking a sense of humor. Dale's use of the word
fealty was hilarious, if not accurate.  Obviously [insert name
of favorite early modernist explosive dude] would not last long on this
list.

Bill Luoma

ps.  Charles, I feel like my ability to exist freely and openly on this list
is being hampered by Henry Gould's excessive posting.  Could you have a word
with him on my behalf?

Yup, it is an unreasonable imposition to require as a qualification to
discuss psychoanalysis that one have been an analyst or analysand, just as
it would be unreasonable to limit the discussion of poetry to poets or
christianity to christians. I'm not sure, however, that I'm disqualified on
that account. I was in psychoanalytic psychotherapy, couch and all, three
times a week for three and a half years. I was myself a psychotherapist for
15 years, during which I had a lot of professional contact with those of
the psychoanalytic persuasion, some of whom are friends, some not, and some
are good therapists, perhaps despite their theoretical underpinnings. This
involved extensive discussions of cases both in formal case conferences and
in private consultations.
But maybe I don't know enough. Maybe only the convinced know enough.
By the way, that Lacan works within the framework of a rather strange
mythology in no way invalidates his ideas about poetry, it merely renders
the process by which he arrives at them somewhat more tortuous.
One's allegiance to one's analyst or one's challenges to psychoanalytic
theory are relevant to this list's purpose in that Freud's metaphoric
system has been hugely influential on some poets and thinkers about poetry.
Beyond that, I'm not sure that this is the forum for this discussion. Let's
just not, those of us who try to question everything that comes before us
in the form of language, exclude this one area and assume as fact what is
merely speculative, in this case the existence of an entity in the mind
called "the unconscious."

Given that for poetic triteness & drivel, Fenton perfectly matches his
buddy Hughes, the piece is the expected defense & illustration of Hughes
greatness. Wish Fenton had remained the excellent journalist that he was
in his early days -- in the realm of poetry & poetics, he can't write
his way out of a paperbag.

Stein in popular culture exists as two quotes (one about Oakland, one
about flowers); as being rather large and square-faced physically; and
being a lesbian.  Even the (commonsensepo, as it were) popularly-diffused
noteriety of her "difficult" work has faded from mass culture.  (About the
latter, see Michael Davidson's wonderful new book, Ghostlier
Demarcations..It doesn't really address the "material text" in quite the
way it promises, and it has longeurs, but features a wonderful mind and
lots of great bits; anyway it examines a WC Fields movie that included a
rather clever and good parody of Stein's poetry...I guess the equivalent
would be travesties of Clark Coolidge on Saturday Night Live.  Stein has
well and truely faded from official culture's mind compared to back then.)

its also experimentation that produced electricity, cathode rays, the
computer your typing on, the radio in the background, the food you eat,
the toilet you shit in & those newfangled aluminum baseball bats.  Of
course whether a poet acknowledges experimentation in their work is no
indication of whether the poem fails.  & besides the only experiments I
ever did in Chem class was trying to write poetry in the margins of my
notebook without being discovered.

unpredictable, thus the "scientific method"...

somethings are best approached backchannel.  & what really can be said
until real facts are known.  its interesting to me that because a number
of us spoke up in support of visual poetry, weve acquired some kinda
marketing niche that we occupy as heir & keeper.

I dont understand why anyone is being silenced, its quite easy to
acquire work from south american visual poets, for shows & publication,
this was one person's attempt via one south american contact who
admittedly is very well known & influential, but southamerican visual
poetry is not a ship passing in the night, it has a 50 year history with
100s of practioners.  (Check out Cesar Espinosa's Corrosive Signs:
Essays on Experimental Poetry (Damn there's that word again) Visual,
Concrete, Alternative, 1990. Translated by Harry Polkinhorn.)

 No one I know has an agenda for world domination by the american vispo
mafia...there is certainly an interest in seeing visual poetry
represented as an international movement that operates via networking
outside of the normal publishing & academic channels, & expanding
textuality beyond 2 dimensions....but a little freespirited
consciousness raising doesnt represent a stronghold to be defended
against all odds.

A reminder, if any is needed, of how the rules of the game
have changed. Those who are reporting directly on today’s
obscenities are likely to be of an age closer to Gellhorn’s

OBITUARIES

Martha Gellhorn

A WITNESS TO OUR WORLD AT WAR

THE streetcars of her hometown of St Louis, Missouri, shaped
the life of Martha Gellhorn, who has died aged 89.  Her
suffragette mother and doctor father had raised her to
confidence and campaigning, and, as a child, she had freedoms
her peers did not; she roamed the city alone on those cars,
looking in on lives unlike her own.  "One bends one's one twig
and it stays bent," she drawled long after.

She was briefly collegiate at Bryn Mawr, she was a cub
reporter surviving on a diet of doughnuts.  Then at 21, in
1930, her life began with a steerage-class passage to Europe,
$75 and a suitcase.  She went to Paris to become a foreign or,
better still, a roving correspondent.  Just like that.

Even for a girl who looked, as she once remarked, like the
cartoon character Betty Boop - all batted eyelashes - and had
limitless insouciance, it did not happen quite like that.
Gellhorn sold any old writing she could and got a "very high-
class education - standing room at ground level to watch
history as it happened".

Her learning process involved European poverty and politics
and an affair, later a short marriage, with the radical
journalist Bertrand de Jouvenal, who, as a youth, had been the
lover of a middle-aged Colette.  She innocently took a room in
a bawdy-house and knowingly bought absurd Parisian couture
cheap at the end of the season.  She was also introduced to
her first Nazis, "scrubbed and parrot-brained".  They didn't
teach a girl any of that at Bryn Mawr.

The process also covered returning to - and crossing -
America, walking in on an oil boom and on the great Russian
film director Sergei Eisenstein, who was failing to film in
Mexico, and writing her first novel.  It took her on to the
payroll of the Federal Relief Agency, for which she filed
reports on the lives of the forgotten poor, which read like
epic captions for Depression photographers: she was sacked for
inspiring local revolutions.

It allowed her the naivety to cadge room and board from HG
Wells in London, where she wrote a vivid eye-witness account
of a southern lynching she later admitted that she had never
seen; and to accept the offer of President Roosevelt and his
wife, Eleanor - her mother's campaigning friend - to stay in
the White House, which was pretty homey then.  She put up
there in Abraham Lincoln's bedroom and was fed regular meals
during an awkward patch, when her furious moral righteousness
made her otherwise unemployable.

There she finished The Trouble I've Seen, fiction based on her
underclass investigations.  It was published in 1936, with her
portrait, blonde and elegant, on its dust jacket: this was a
titillating combination and a success.  She was immediately
celebrated, but fled the hoopla by holidaying in Florida.

At a Key West bar called Sloppy Joe's, she ran into Ernest
Hemingway, bulky in his "odiferous Basque shorts".  Two big
celebs in a small town.  His books had been her models.  She
said so.  He had seen her face on Troubles.  All afternoon and
evening, they drank Papa Dobles, two-and-a-half jiggers of
white Bacardi rum, juice of two fresh limes, swirled in a
rusty electric blender.  It sounds like a Hollywood "meet-
cute" - she walked into the bar in a black dress and high
heels, with her terrific mother in tow.  The Bacall and Bogart
versions were merely re-makes.  She seems to have thought she
had found the partner her nerve deserved.  Hemingway was
hooked.

He was also married and off to cover the Spanish Civil War.
She decided to join the fight and him (perhaps not in that
order), this time with a rucksack and $50, a letter of
introduction from Collier's magazine, and a notion that the
"correct response to a war against fascism was simply to be
present on the right side".  She thought that war
correspondents reported the battlefield, and was surprised,
but willing, when one suggested that a description of ordinary
life in besieged Madrid was worth sending home.

Collier's printed the piece, put her name on their masthead,
and there she was, a war correspondent and Hemingway's lover -
and under his patronage, eating his tinned supplies and
sharing his mattress on the road,. yet still stubbornly
independent.  Her reports from Spain were more candid than
his.  The ration portion of dried salted cod weighed as
heavily as the shells.  She did not have to pretend to be an
authority.

One editor at Collier's appreciated and trusted her copy and,
for eight years after that, she could go where she wanted and
write what she saw.  "I had the chance to see the life of my
time, which was war." The British unprepared for total war;
the Czechoslovak army walking home after the German land-grab;
the Finns democratic but frozen, fighting the Russians; the
Chinese, in hunger and filth, out-enduring the Japanese
invaders.  Her base was a house outside Havana, which she had
made over for Hemingway and herself.  They married and settled
in.  They worked on fiction.  But Gellhorn wanted to be in on
the war at last breaking out in Europe, and a crazy Caribbean
sea-hunt for U-boats (with a resulting, unpublished, extremely
funny piece) was not enough.  She was drinking daiquiris in a
bar on the Mexican border when the newspaper boy hawked her
the edition reporting Pearl Harbour.

Hemingway was having a fine time with his sporting Cuban
buddies chasing phantom Nazi subs.  He had already done global
conflict.  Gellhorn failed to persuade him to engage with the
world at war a second time around.  The marriage fractured.
She reached London and followed the action in Europe and North
Africa as closely as she could with, or usually without,
official permission, and with directions from friends in
useful places.  She advanced recklessly up through Italy with
the Allies.  Hemingway's telegram to her there read: "Are you
a war correspondent or my wife in bed?"

This time, he eventually came after her.  Their rivalry was
not friendly anymore.  She seems to have been Hemingway's
personal bullshit-detector, especially when she coldly watched
him holding court in a London hospital after a drunken
accident.  Gellhorn stowed away on a DDay hospital ship and
went ashore at Normandy.  Hemingway crossed the Channel as
officially as possible, but did not land.

In a hotel in free Paris, Gellhorn was advised by her old
buddy, the photographer Robert Capa, to demand a divorce.  She
did, then loosely attached herself to the 82nd Airborne
through the bitter 1944-45 winter of the Battle of the Bulge,
and also to its leader, the heroic General James Gavin.  She
was present when the chaotic mass of the Russian army swarmed
up to the other Allies.  She was in newly-liberated Dachau, at
the apex of her anger, when peace was declared.

What the inmates told her there - that it had been useless to
protest or weep about what happened to them was the antithesis
of all she had believed in; she mistrusted Germany ever after.
Her St Louis ancestry included both immigrant Germans and
Jews.

About all of these places and people she wrote simply.  An
American prose style of Shaker plainness was laboured at by
many of her contemporaries.  To Gellhorn, it seems to have
come naturally.  She spoke that way.  She believed real
reporters did not take notes, but knew instinctively what
remained forever important - trivia, the tone of the times.
This might include a GI toasting himself a front-line cheese
sandwich from K rations, or a Dutch slave labourer, recently
freed, buying tulips in the ruins of a German city.

It seldom included any utterance, or even mention, of a
politician.  "All politicians are bores and liars and fakes.
I talk to people," she said.  To read her dispatches
(collected as The Face Of War and The View From The Ground) is
to be granted instant access to where she was, whenever it
was.

The business in peace was to settle down.  As a woman divorced
on the grounds of abandonment, Gellhorn made some random
gestures to pacification.  These included acquiring a decrepit
property in London, returning to Washington - only to find
herself in solo outrage against McCarthyism - trying fiction
and playwriting, and adopting a 15-month-old Italian orphan,
Sandy.  She brought him up, supporting their life together in
cheap places like Mexico by journalism and writing potboilers
for women's magazines - novellas differing from her own taste
in their happy endings.  And from her own life too, for
General Gavin had married a nice young girl.

Gellhorn's next love, David Gurewitsch (a protégé of Mrs
Roosevelt) could barely cope with her.  She was courted by Tom
Matthews, a recently retired editor of Time magazine, with a
Mt Rushmore profile and a sound mind, and they married.  But
he wanted an urbane life in Britain, and she missed the
excitement, and even more the whole-soul engagement, of the
fight against fascism.  "I am a loner.  I am not a team
player," she said once - she could certainly be unsociable,
abrupt and grand - and "The ideal is to live five blocks away
from a man who makes you laugh and is wrapped up in -his
work".  The marriage petered out after nine years.

And so, by the 1960s, she was wandering again, observing more
of the 50-plus countries of her travels.  She knew a lot about
how people respond to place, especially when they respond by
misbehaving: in that honestly funny book Travels With Myself
And Another, she confessed how she misbehaved herself, how she
was revolted by stench in west Africa and daunted by dengue
fever going up river by canoe.  She repeatedly fell in love
with countries, affaires which led her to hang curtains in
impossible shacks.  Her long-lasting final devotion was to a
cottage on the Welsh borders, which had demanding vegetables
in the garden.

Her association with Collier's had lapsed with her editor's
death in the 1940s: thereafter, she had often to give herself
assignments, and pay her own expenses, to satisfy her
curiosity.  For one long period, she had a writer's block; for
another, there was an editorial block against her copy - she
was no longer a sexy novelty nor yet venerable, and the
robustness of her New Deal attitude was out of fashion.
Nevertheless, with help - which she remembered as rather
minimal from the Guardian, she reached Vietnam in 1966 to
report the war (of which she was ashamed) that confirmed
America as a colonial power.

Her long perspective eventually became valued again, when she
returned to Madrid at the time of Franco's death, or to
Castro's Cuba, where she saw, in the splendour of the full-
grown trees now filling the garden of her old home, "the years
of my life made real".  At 80, she took off to inquire into
the US invasion of Panama, supple of spine and mind, stroppy
as ever.  Granta took her up as a sibyl; its editors and
writers longed to have lived as she had done.

Gellhorn stayed flexible, except, notably, in her attitude to
Israeli-Palestinian relations; she saw Israel always as the
defiant David of its founding battles.  She planned to go
snorkelling with Paul Theroux well into her eighties.  When
surgery on her eyes went awry, she had the doctor
professionally cursed by a Malagasy medicine man.

She dined with the BBC's John Simpson on his way to Bosnia.
She saw off the East-West nuclear confrontation she most
feared.  She became part of the century's image bank.  And to
the end, this fierce pacifist reported drinking pitchers of
red wine, or iced Scotch, with the children and the
grandchildren of fighters she had known.

Veronica Horwell

Julia Pascal writes: I was writing a play set at the Nuremberg
Trials.  Martha Gellhorn had been there.  I wrote to her
London publishers, she called me and in the next post came an
American edition of her report.  I rang to thank her and
suggest lunch.  In her strong St Louis voice she rasped, "I
loathe lunch.  I drink".

In her Eaton Square flat, she took whisky on the rocks and
offered me "a very good vodka someone gave me for Christmas".
At 82, Gellhorn was sharper than almost anyone I had ever met.
Slim, well made-up, elegant, she obviously cared about her
appearance.  She was quick to tell me mine needed improvement.
"You ought to put your hair up," she said, examining my long
hair with disapproval.  "Looking good isn't just vanity.  It's
a public service."

The hair-up obsession was linked to her past.  As a young
woman, she was always chignoned, "until the Nazis ruined my
ear".  She had contracted an infection in Germany in 1933.
Doctors in Nazi armbands botched her ear operation, so, with a
huge bandage around her ear, without money or passport, she
fled to Paris, ending up in the American Hospital.  She never
wore her hair up again.

We spoke about Nuremberg and I told her how watching hours of
celluloid archive gave me the feeling that the trials only
existed on film.  "Don't forget I've been to Dachau," she
replied.  "I've seen Germany flooding with a mad stream of
slave labourers.  For me, the unreal people were the people on
trial.  I looked at them day after day and was forced to think
about what crimes those men had committed." She talked of
sleeping in a makeshift dormitory in a disused factory.  "I
came back from the trials and vomited night after night.  It
was impossible to hear all the testimony without a violent
reaction.  Then I thought, if this is what I feel hearing
this, what was it like to live it?"

She spoke easily of the ageing process and blamed the onset of
her arthritis on the British damp.  Always spoilt by male
attention, she noticed her "invisibility" with advancing age.
"But," she announced, "there are advantages.  Nobody is
jealous once you get to 70 or 75, and then there is always the
companionship of darling young men.

"Why do people talk of the horrors of old age?  It's great.  I
feel like a fine old car with the parts gradually wearing out,
but I'm not complaining.  Those who find growing old terrible
are people who haven't done what they wanted with their
lives."

Martha Gellhorn, journalist, born November 8, 1908; died
February 15, 1998

My Chem teacher interrupted a lab in molecular modelling one day to show us
how to make giraffes and elephants out of the spheres and sticks instead. I
can't figure out if that is one of your failed experiments or not. Perhaps
he only got into chemistry as the result of a failed experiment.

sorry, I inadvertently hit the mouse key, which is built into the keyboard.


To resume:

Nope, the issue isn't who can discuss psychoanalysis, although this is the
tree that everyone hides behind.  I assume you must have some resentment for
whatever failure you experienced in your days on the couch; you must know,
however, that not everyone who has been in analysis has had the same
experience.  In any event, I'm speaking of psychoanalysis from the
Freudian/Lacanian perspective, and I'm objecting to the cavalier manner in
which the Freud/Lacan paradigms are dismissed out of hand as having no value,
and I'm objecting in particularly to being told that I, and many, many others,
are blindly following an unsupportable doctrine that has its roots in Wagner.
Isn't it just as fair for me to suggest that had you chosen a different
analyst, things might have worked out better for you?  Since Lacan, with
justification, inveighed against the brand of psychoanalysis being practiced
within the U.S., wouldn't it also be fair to suggest that perhaps your
experience isn't as heavily weighted as it might seem at first blush?

As a matter of fact, Mark, I'm not prohibiting anyone from saying anything;
being censored isn't the same thing as being held intellectually accountable
for one's remarks.  Why should you think that your predjudices, and that's
exactly what they are, should go unchallanged?  Personally, I think that those
who want to discuss Freud/Lacan/whoever should be able to do so without the
bland dismissals and put-downs of the anti crowd, who continually declare the
entire Freudian/Lacanian undertaking as bullshit, occasionally with snippets
of other authors to buttress their acrimonious and anti-intellectual opinions,
and they frequently do it with techniques more suitable to political machines;
for example, Freudians/Lacanians are often accused of being intractable,
intolerant, and rigid in both theory and debate by exactly those who
capriciously reject Freud as having any current value -- just as you declared
that the oedipal complex, penis envy, etc to be ipso facto null & void, or
worse.  End of discussion.  I learned some time ago the intransigence of the
anti's in this arena, and I have no illusion of changing anyone's mind about
it.  Thankfully, the Lacanian nets allow one to elaborate on one's thinking in
a space that's relatively free of the air of intimidation and animosity that
seems to dominate this one.

ahh, the cat is out of the bag: the old self-fulfilling prophecy: if there is
criticism of the Freudian couch, then it is the patient who failed -- obviously
it couldn't be the analyst or the analyst's system of beliefs -- and all
criticism on the "patient's" part can then be construed as "resentment" which
feeds it straight back into the psychoanalytic machinery -- three more years on
the couch at so much an hour...

=B6  this is definitely a concern. possibly I lack
a sense of humor (cf. my post on experimental
physics) and so can't appreciate Dale's posts,
but it does seem that Henry, for ex., is capable
of existing here without gratuitously insulting
other people.

now as to what Entity any single person is
dissenting from, I'm a bit @ a loss. it's not as if
this list is all that mono-logical to begin with
(except for bad old Bowering), and I tend to
understand Henry and Dale as other poets with
other opinions, whom I dis-/agree with on a case-
by-case basis =96 not as Heroic Outsiders come to
turn the moneylenders out of the temple.

possibly if we stop thinking of ourselves as
Important Individuals Who Are Making History
we can talk a little bit about poetry or poetics
or gameshows or anything without crap added
(for extra flavor)? it was Albert Speer used to
design his buildings to crumble elegantly (evidence
of a Once Mighty Culture); me, I'd just like a
little bigger place.

incidentally, I'm Spartacus.

Zola wrote "The Experimental Novel" in which he described the novel as a
scientific experiment.  Does anyone know any older uses of the term
applied to literature or poetry?  I generally took the term as roughly
synomymous with innovative.  It has a nice sort of "let me tinker in my
backyark and see what I come up with" connotation.  How about
"avant-garde"?  Is this still a usable term?

       Hello I will be reading poetry in BROOKLYN NY (at the
       FALL CAFE 307 Smith St. Carroll Gardens host Prageeta Sharma)
       Sunday this coming 3PM.....
               with JANE RANSOM.....
        Ms. Ransom is the author of 2 books of poetry (most recently,
         SCENE OF THE CRIME, Story Line Press), and a very strange
         novel (that should be of interest to readers of Harryman etc)
         ( BYE BYE,NYU PRESS 1997). I think she'll read poetry.
            If you can't come for me, come for her----
            If you can't come for either of us, come for brooklyn.
            I should probably not mention that she's the grandaughter
              of a famous equilibrist.
           for more information, call me 718-499-1697....

I could argue my points in detail (and they're not exactly novel), and I
could illustrate them from practice. I should think that the burden of
proof would rest with those who assert novel science. Be that as it may, I
think, as I said before, that this is not the place for that discussion.
Which leaves you free to assume that our disagreements are because of my
neuroses or because my analysis was unsuccessful.
Ad homina get you only so far. I'm glad you had a good time on the couch.
You might have had an even better time in an office where the therapist
doesn't require his patients to become true believers. Quien sabe?

Beverly Dahlen, a native Oregonian, has lived and worked in San Francisco
for many years.  Three volumes of her ongoing work A Readin_ have appeared,
and excerpts from it continue to appear in periodicals (Bombay Gin, Mirage
#4/Period[ical], The Iowa Review).  Two selections from Dahlen's work will
be included in the anthology Moving Borders, edited by Mary Margaret Sloan,
forthcoming from Talisman House.  Dahlen has thought hard and long about
literacy, language, perception and oppression and what is more, she has
teased her thought, like Ann-Margret's hair in Viva Las Vega_, into an
intoxicating poetry.

Lauren Gudath, born in Tampa in 1970, lives in San Francisco.  Wolves, her
long poem written in 1995, was published as a chapbook by Xurban press.
Her work has appeared in Superflux, Proliferation, Clamour and Idiom
On-Line Journal.  She is a young poet whose careful, broken and bruised
line extends a remarkable contention, like a blanket of starlight, over the
materials of a woman=B9s life.

Has anyone thought that perhaps the general silence of the list on these =
issues is really just a sign of apathy? I mean, yes I suppose I would =
think that this thing or that thing was horrible perhaps if it had been =
said to me or about me, etc. But I don't think that I would go kvetching =
about it on this list; I mean it's all just too dramatic. Nor do I think =
this is the place to be arguing about whether or not a poet is a good =
person. I don't give a damn about poetzes personal lives; if I did, I =
suppose there would be a lot of poets I wouldn't be reading. I'm waiting =
for all of this stuff to just blow away, so that maybe we can all talk =
poetics (instead of petty politics). As for all of the name calling and =
finger pointing, well for chrissakes, didn't y'all get your fill of it in =
kindlinggarten? I refuse to participate in any more parlour games until =
the adults come back. Nyah nyah nyah nyah...

Plenary and workshop sessions facilitated by faculty and faculty organizers
will address the key strategies, needs and visions of part time/ adjunct,
GTA and non-tenured faculty over the three day working conference.
        This conference takes place at a time when faculty, both full and
part time, at institutions of higher education are under an escalating
assault.  The current trend to degrade the profession through the creation
and expansion of an increasingly polarized multi-tier system is
academically indefensible and is in the worst interest of students, their
parents and the increasingly exploited instructional work-force.  The
administrative and governing apparatus prioritizes profit-oriented
research, endowments, infrastructure, and administration over and against
education. The push to drive down faculty salaries, eliminate tenure and
populate the university with a group of over-worked contingent laborers may
advance the careers of some administrators, but it represents a betrayal of
the university's educational mission.
        In order to combat the forces arrayed against students and faculty
alike, we are coming together to educate and organize. This second congress
is part of a growing movement of lower-tier faculty, students, and
organizers to take an active role in the struggle to save higher education.
        This congress is envisioned as the continuation of an organized
effort by lower-tier faculty to transform the institutions in which they
teach.
Please publicize this in appropriate forums.

Dear Ms. Koo,

Final issue? Does this mean that your magazine will soon be defunct? Should
I offer my condolences, or are you moving on to bigger/better things?

though I fear this means no more greyhound poems from Irby, I think this is
some of the best news I've seen on the list in weeks -- Congrats. to him,,,

are there any recent Irby chapbooks or broadsides?  haven't seen anything
new for a while.

Is his Max Douglas poem still in print?

Judy,

I'd heard that there was an effort being made in this direction, but that it
was far from a sure shot. This is great news! Congratulations to Ken & send my
best.

Aldon,

Think Ken will really give up the Dog? I'm pretty sure _Max Douglas_ is long
outta print, along with all the other early work. The last chapbook I'm aware
of from Ken is a letterpress production, _Antiphonal And Fall To Fall_
(Kavyayantra Press, 1994), printed by Patrick Tillery & never really
distributed. Not exactly "new," huh? There are some more recent poems in
various issues of _First Intensity_, _House Organ_ & the most recent _Apex of
the M_. Anyone know of others?

A  "collected" Irby, or at least a "selected" is long overdue, but with ALL
those unpublished poems, well ...

We've had this discussion before, haven't we?

all best,
Charles Smith

Aldon,

Ken may still have some copies. Otherwise, you'll need to track down Patrick
Tillery. Somewhere in this mess I've got an address for him in Seattle that
was good a couple of years ago. Let me know if no one else can help out better
than this, & I'll see if I can't find it.

      While Hughes is not my favorite poet, "poetic triteness and
drivel" doesn't accurately describe the poems on Plath. Venom
seems to distort that judgment, IMHO. Name a line or a poem, at least.

Yes, lawdie, lawd, félicitations sincères to ken -- for a long, long overdue due
--

as for what is available of his work, besides what Charles mentione din terms of
recent magazines, Ken recently told me that CALL STEPS, the 1992 gathering of
work from '77 to '79, is still available from Station Hill. One should also be
able to find copies of NOTUS 10 which has a 30 page Irby section.

Someone should put out a largish SELECTED, or a collection of the 80s & 90s
writings.

And if anyone on the list has an extra copy of  Irby's CATALPA, I'd love to buy
one (my copy walked some time ago & it's the toughest book to find!)

I wouldn't waste venom on either of them. & I do think  triteness and drivel
describe the new Hughes book rather accurately. -- Pierre

Dear Joe--

I did not find depredations against Latinamerican writers amusing; I found
your probably accidental careless language amusing. In 1963-5 I was in
Latinamerica, surrounded by poets and other writers who were being
oppressed by the US-backed dictators. Where were you then? In 1967-71 I was
delivering Norteamericano poetry books to the Cuban trade mission in
Montreal. Were you helping out? In 1966 I got thumped by a USAmerican
oilman in a restaurant in Calgary because I objected to his loudmouth
denunciation of Cubans. Were you there to help me out? What I am saying is
that though I was not carrying a rifle in the hilles of Nicaragua to resist
the US--paid gunmen, I dont have to apologize for my sympathies. If you
were there before I was, okay, I'll make an agreement with you. But
careless language does not help the anti-USA liberation movement. By
Cubanos I was proud to be called a fellow-traveller. Still am. When the US
set off bombs in the Cuban trade mission in Montreal, I am glad I was not
in the building at the time, but that's because I like living.

Well, I'm sorry you won't take your time. Now I doubt the worth of
your judgment more generally, and will remember to discount other
statements you make elsewhere. While that's not going to be a problem
for you, it's nice when there is actual conversation and use of thought.

Pierre Joris couldn't be bothered to explain to me why Hughes
poetry on Plath is "drivel." Is this generally the view on
this list? Is it a judgment of particular weaknesses in
Hughes' poetry, or does Hughes write a kind of poetry
which is assumed to be defunct or something? I haven't been
on this listserv for long, and i'm sure there are all sorts
of shared assumptions I know know thing about. Maybe there is
someone who would take a minute, on the list or back of it,
to say a word about this.

Dale:
        Though visual poetry by its very constitution is silent, visual
poets are not -- they may not be speaking up for the reasons Steve Tills
suggests -- we are doing the work, we are working, we are ...... Please
don't construe slow motion toward e-mail as a lack of support for what
sounds like a break-through project.
        Three other points:
        1. Skeptical of much fast information in this information age, I
cannot respond to an issue I know so little about. Less than ten e-mail
postings does not firm footing make. Many listlings may be waiting for more
of the story to surface. Rush to judgement has led to far too much
bloodshed.
        2. From what I remember of Padin's letter, the project is off-track
but not permanently shelved -- in fact, from experience, projects that are
worthwhile doing get done in the small press world even if they take years
and years. Time in small press is not linear. I think this project, with or
without Kent's intelligent collaboration, will see the light.
        3. Latin America visual poets have been oft-heard in the U.S. If
you would like, I (along with Luigi-Bob Drake, Miekal And, Bob Grumman, and
others) could work up a bibliography of work published in the 1990's (or as
far back as you would like).

Tillery still has copies, but he left Seattle in January, or that was the

Mike -- sorry, I certain ly didn't want to sound dismissive in terms of
your inquiry -- it truly is a thing of time -- and yesterday the mail
brought 4 _new_ books I would much rather read than think about TH -- while
also preparing for the arrival of Allen Fisher, to my mind one of the very
best British poets writing right now (BTW -- read Fisher & you'll see
immediately why I don't care for TH's poetry).

    Briefly then, Ted Hughes, for me, is a very traditionalist, british
establishment poet, whose language and imagery I find trite indeed in that
they use the most cliched poetic topi without in anyway renewing them;
whose line is flat-footed and rhythmically dead (listen to it -- it just
kind of drones, or at best gets a chummy story-in-the-pub quality to it --
old-boy-network à la English country-gentleman mitigated by a
mytho-male-ish Iron Johnish swagger) . It is the old "lyric" -romantic
tradition as if nothing had happened in poetry or the world for the last
hundred years, except for Eliotian modernism (free verse) and the
confessional exaltation of personal neurosis as  dynamo & authoriy for
legitimization of "truth in poetry". There's no sweep, no sense of language
(it's that dreary old transparent mimetic medium), no excitement -- it is
stifling official safe "verse" of exactly the kind required to become a
poet laureate. The British cultural establishment needs such types &
glorifies just such a minor poetry (as it did also glorify that other
dullard, the librarian from Hull) -- just as every Brit generation needs
its token tame Irish poet -- Shameless Hussy, I mean Seamus Heany being
this generation's 'official (Anglo)-Irish Poet. The problem is not so much
the Hughes & Heany's -- everyone obviously has the right to write as they
seem fit -- but rather the fact that the cultural establishment (from the
Crown on down via Poetry Societies and the publishers to the media and the
school system) sets up the likes of H & H as the great, canonical, etc.
poetry of the times, and that that setup has specific cultural-political
agendas of the most reactionary kind. 'Nuff said for now.

    Just let me add that if you would like a sense of what's new in English
poetry, have a look at anthologies such as CONDUCTORS OF CHAOS ed. by Iain
Sinclair, (Picador) THE NEW BRITISH POETRY ed. by Allnutt, aguiar, edwards
and mottram, (Paladin) FUTURE EXILES --Fisher, Griffiths, Catling --
(Paladin) or OUT OF NOWHERE ed. o'sullivan & mulford (reality street
editions).

Since Hughes is getting the treatment over the
Birthday Letters poems, I would like to praise
another his works: Those who haven't read Crow
are really missing something. That book is a far
cry from"trite & drivel"--dark, archetypal, those
poems will hold up his rep well into the next century.
There is also a fine tape of Hughes reading from
Crow.

I find citing Larkin amusing in this case, since biographies
of Larkin seem to indicate he could be expertly "unpleasant"
himself. (In Larkin's defense, he was a jazz lover--that alone
should expunge most of one's life's sins.)

Wouldn't "waste venom"? Meaning that they are beneath venom? That sounds
like venom.

I've read the Hughes book and I've found some poems to be very moving and
real (such as the poem about the rag rug) and others (such as the one that
gushes on about astrology, quoted by Fenton) to be pretty bad. It doesn't
have the brilliance of Crow, but it is a worthy book.

Why put all of this energy into bashing a poet you don't like, Pierre? So
you don't like him-- big deal. You seemed to have decided that a long time
ago. Are you sure you have really given the book a fair reading? Have you
even read it?

I've wondered about that too, Mike. There does seem to be a shared
assumption here, which in itself doesn't bother me so much since I think
this listserve does appeal to readers and poets with a strong shared
interest in experimental poetry, language poetry, etc., and I subscribe to
this list to hear what they have to say and to talk about they kind of
poetry that doesn't always make it into the mainstream.

What does strike me as unfortunate is when people (anywhere, not just
here) toss off judgements (twice even!) without any attempt to
substantiate or even play with the idea. When people do that, I have to
conclude that they are not interested in ideas-- not even their own ideas.

I've been in groups before-- we all have-- that went downhill when they
became dominated by one poetic "agenda" and a received list of acceptable
poets. I am wary of any marks of Cain or claims to demi-God status. Let's
please just talk about poetry.

Uh, Larkin was a jazz "lover" who hated virtually everything that sounded
stylistically later than about the year 1950, or about half of jazz's
recorded history, so I'm not sure how much of a defense that is.

          It was called "Crow tries the media"
             (but i think hardcore hughes fans would
              probably call it one of his slighter poems)
          And his book on SHAKESPEARE, mostly UGH!

Interesting the gender here of el nino (really). I am reminded of a wonderfully

there.

I have been unsubbed for the last two weeks, so pardon if this post is
redundant.  The earliest example of "experiment" applied to poetry that I
know of is found at the beginning of Wordsworth's preface to the Lyrical
Ballads (which btw is an innovative and intentionally oxymoronic title):

"The fist Volume of these poems has already been submitted to general perusal.
It was published, as an experiment, which, I hoped, might be of some use to
ascertain, how far, by fitting to metrical arrangement a selection of the
real language of men in a state of vivid sensation, that sort of pleasure
and that quantity of pleasure may be imparted, which a Poet may rationally
endeavour to impart."

The rest of the piece makes it clear that Wordsworth was thinking of the poems
individually and as a group in terms of text which defies public expectation
in order to find out what will happen, both to his poetry-making and to
the expectations of poetry readers.

Who was it a few months ago that said that Hughes wrote some effective
poems about nasty animals attacking other nasty animals?  That seems to be
the strength of his earlier work. Crow impressed me years ago with its
fine nastiness, though I haven't followed him in the last decade or so.
The snippets I have seen quoted from the Plath book are quite vile.

That said, I much prefer Hughes to Larkin.  I was quite surprised a few
years ago when the revelations about Larkin's racism, sexism and general
nastiness came out.  I was not surprised at the revelations, but at the
surprise they evoked in others.  I had always read his poetry as the
expression of a sort of snide British anti-intellectual xenophobic
resentful postwar anti-modernist mindset.  He condemned the three "Ps":
"Picasso, Pound, Parker," who had ruined painting, poetry, and jazz, in
his opinion.

books in a beautiful hard-bound remaindered edition for five bucks....


I read it before bed...


Yesterday I purchased the blue covered-version of The Gertrude Stein

After I read some of it I opened up the Gluck again and found it no so

They're both lovely...

ASK MRS. TED HUGHES

Dear Mrs. Hughes:

I met a man at his publication party last week and we fell in love. I'm sure
he's the one because we want to be together every second and our feelings are
more intense than either of us has ever known before. My friends and my
therapist say it can't be real love when it happens so fast. How do you know
when it's really and truly love?

Dear Mrs. Ted Hughes:

I found a stash of erotic books under my daughter's bed. She's a junior in high
school and a good student, but I find it incredibly upsetting that she's
reading pornography. I believe that all pornography exploits women and our
bodies. How do I confront her about this matter? What would you do in my shoes?

Do not be afraid, it is not so.

Dear Mrs. Hughes:

Imagining killing someone doesn't make you a murderer, thinking about stealing
something doesn't make you a thief, and so dreaming about the sweet lucrative
life as a highly paid commercial novelist even though you're committed to
experimental literature surely does not make you a cheater. Does it?

Dear Mrs. Ted:

Can you tell me *your* definition of plagiarism? I need to know because a
member of my writing group and so-called former "friend" has accused me of
plagiarizing her story. It's true that the plot, the language and, okay, much
of the punctuation, in *my* story (which WAS published) does bear a striking
resemblance to the (UNPUBLISHED) story she had submitted to our writing group
for feedback. But what about her powerful influence on me? Couldn't I have read
her story and admired it and simply been the victim of unconscious imitation?
If anything, I feel she ought to be flattered. Never-the-less, she has
persuaded the other members of the group to kick me out (see the CONTROL she
has over others' minds!?). I desperately want back in, but CERTAINLY not at the
expense of my integrity. What do YOU think? Can a person be guilty of stealing
something if they don't BELIEVE they stole it?

I'm not attentive to Hughes' work, so therefore haven't addressed this thread.
But I do have a question for you.  Why is "dark, archetypal" "part of the
problem?"  Are you referring specifically to Hughes' work or to larger problems
of poetics?  Not to say they don't exist, especially in poetry, but I can
see why one might have trouble with archetypes.  But the 'dahk' seems like
an essential element of a lot of art.  Or maybe I'm still spinning from the
Cassavete's movie I saw last night.  D.

to lurch to Pierre's defence: P. is a member of the British Poets' list
also, where a vocab. of anti-apologetic vituperation has steadily accrued
re: Hughes, Heaney, Larkin; to a fellow BP member, his letter is
unsurprising (even approaching a -form- letter).  I'd go along with most
of what he says.  But I do think, or am itching to permit myself to think,
that Larkin is starting to get an unproductively nasty press - that
is, it's always easy to smack an idol down, sometimes even easy to do so
-actually- rather than merely to gesture towards smacking in a fuss of
reflex dismissal, but Larkin has become an ENEMY on dogmatic grounds (at
least in England).  Perhaps it is, in part, due to the awkward fact that
Larkin was a clever and adept writer, that it is so commonly found to be
worthwhile to make the customary dismissal; his validity as a genuine
target for criticism, however, should rather -discourage- dismissal.
Dismissal is readily made tactical, and such a tactic readily submits
itself to 'communities' as a differential facility; but if what matters is
more than mere USism, this facility is just a symptom of vanity.  Many
writes can be dismissed out of hand, I'd maintain.  Larkin isn't quite one
of them.  Though I hate him as much as the next woman, naturally (nervous
simpering).

actually, if you read the welcome msg, you'll find that the listserv's
agenda is not hidden at all; it is explicitly intended as a forum for
discussion of innovative (i can't remember what the exact wording of the
msg is, but along those lines) poetics, *not* for a generalized discussion
of poetry across the board; tho these sometimes occur, they're by no means
central.  hence what you consider dismissive is an acknowledgement that
hughes is not an important topic for this list.  i too was puzzled by what
seemed the narrowness of the list when i first joined, but then its purpose
is explicitly NOT to be general.--md

I'm halfway through the book, and I would agree with Pierre that it is
indeed quite trite, quite drivel.  Amazingly so.  Unlenting "I" and "you"
autobiography overburdened with metaphor after metaphor, often more than
one per line so that the lines sag like impossibly heavily ornamented
Christmas tree boughs:

. . . She fed snapshots
Of you and she did not know what
Inflammable celluoid into my silent
Insatiable future, my blind-man's buff
Internal torch of search.

In the same poem (Visit) he brings up his good friend Lucas.  Instead of
just saying "my good friend Lucas," he goes on for five endless lines:

Lucas, my friend, one
Among those three or four who stay unchanged
Like a separate self,
A stone in the bed of the river
Under every change . . .

Personally, I think he should lose the stone in the river line.

I'm reading the book, which was a present, but I asked for it, so I have to
take responsibility there--because I'm a great admirer of Plath and have
read many books on her the past 15 years.  I think she's a great writer and
needs no defending--and if she does need defending, Jacqueline Rose has
already done it wonderfully in her _The Haunting of Sylvia Plath_.

Hughs' attitude towards Plath is condescending, much about how squeaky
clean American she is as opposed to his dark wildness.  I'm sure people
from other countries have good reason to scorn Americans, but his repeated
lazy and trivial use of the word American is irritating.

Kevin (Killian) has read the whole book, and last weekend he was reading to
me the part where Assia Gutman comes into the story--for those of you who
don't know The Story, she's the one Hughs was having the affair with, an
affair which sparked Plath and Hughs' breakup.  Kevin read to me how Plath
and Hughs were puppets in Assia's dark karma, whatever.  But definitely
they were her puppets.  Then I started reading the book and on page 7,
Hughs writes of his relationship with Plath:

Nor did I know I was being auditioned
For the male lead in your drama,
Miming through the first easy movements
As if with eyes closed, feeling for the role.
As if a puppet were being tried on its strings,
Or a dead frog's legs touched by electrodes.

"He's a puppet again!" I shrieked.  "This guy doesn't take responsibility
for his actions."

Reading this book makes me more impressed with Plath--if she was living
under the thumb of this kind of "drivel," she truly was a genius to break
out of it, to get to a place way beyond this kind of stodgy confessionalism.

I agree with Finnegan, a few rounds back: "Crow" still looks like a good book,
maybe even, I don't know, an avant-garde one.  But I also agree with Joris:
"dark, archetypal" aren't the grounds for making a case for it.  Instead, I'd
make a case for its language -- raggedy odds and ends; strange diction; much
of it reads like speech-balloons from comics.  And that would be another
grounds for admiring it: "Crow" has some of the adolescent energy of, say, Mar-
vel Comics; same scatter-shot iconoclasm, same bad taste.  It feels cheap,
& I like that.  I place it in the same category as, say, "Gunslinger" or Rothen
berg's "Cokboy," its near-contemporaries.  Or Kenneth Bernard's "Baboon in the
Restaurant" -- has anyone read that?  Hughes picked it for a poetry prize in
England, and got a lot of grief for that.  It was one of his last "tasteless"
acts,and I admire him for having done it.  Credit where credit's due.

Great post Brian! Truly I say to you that I have not found faith like this in
all of Listserv land. Seriously though--I wouldn't have considered reading
Hughes much (especially after seeing the stanzas posted here lately) save for
the case that you make for "Crow" on this list.

      Pierre--I do appreciate you taking the time to set out some of
your thinking on this, and I'll make an effort to compare Hughes to
the poet you mention liking better. There are some things in your
message I'd like to take up for discussion that don't necessarily
have to be thought about with relation to Hughes, and after I get
enough sleep to *sort of* think, which is what I do at best anyway,
I'll give it a shot.

I've only read the selection in the new yorker; maybe they culled some
of the better ones, I don't know. But the phrase "unrelenting
I and you autobiography" makes no sense to me. Why is autobiography
anymore unrelenting than its absence? (Just trying to pick up on some
assumptions that are evidently obvious to many here, and not for that
reason anything wrong or sinister, just not exactly clear to me--asking
for a bit of patience and a brief explanation where possible).

I think that interview with Clark Coolidge had more effect on my life as
a writer than anything else I ran into in those years.  I seem to
remember that I wore my copy of it out...I believe there was a second
volume which I never found.

Now David, exactly how many call numbers do you remember?

"I and you" that's what (I suspect) appears as unrelenting.

Isn't that what autobiography is automatically about? inquiring minds want
to know.

A: No.

        As I said, this forum's discussion of the more experimental branch
of poetry was precisely why I subscribed. I'm interested in the subject
just as much as you are.

        AND I would like to suggest that it is possible to maintain this
focus on innovative work without dismissing work outside of this concern
in such an offhand and unsupported manner and without resorting to this
"us against them"  rhetoric, aesthetic dogmas or factionalism. Whatever
this is about, it is not about poetry, experimental or otherwise.

        None of us live in a vacuum. Most of us probably have a wide range
of interests and influences as well as an interest in experimental poetry,
and I have noticed that these have factored into past threads in a
broadminded and productive way that does not presume one ruling point of
view. A fresh look and an open mind is usual the starting point for
innovation.

I think this misrepresents Joe Brennan's remarks.  Yes, partly he is

American psychoanalysis.  As I read it, the failure Brennan is

Brennan's point here is demonstrated by Mr. Weiss's elision of

here's the full quote about the poetics list's "project" as stated in
the welcome message.  i can't figure out why so many people can't seem
to get their heads around it...

"The definition of that project, while provisional, and while open to
continual redefinition by list participants, is nonetheless aversive to
a generalized discussion of poetry. Rather, our aim is to support,
inform, and extend those directions in poetry that are committed to
innovations, renovations, and investigations of form and/or/as content,
to the questioning of received forms and styles, and to the creation of
the otherwise unimagined, untried, unexpected, improbable, and
impossible."

How many call numbers? Well, every single one of them. That happen to be

there's a second volume, I never found it either. And if there isn't

I take it that the current discussion or, rather, dismissal, of Hughes is a
turf war. The argument appears to be more against Hughes' position of
influence than it is against his poetry.

Sadly, from what I've seen on this list and others, many people, even
language poets, enjoy turf wars and even the poetics list can stray into
specific cultural-political agendas of the most reactionary kind.

This is about as bad for the poetics list as it is for Hughes. Maybe it's a
personal question:

                What takes precedence: political manoevering or poetics? There's nothing
saying they have to be synonymous.

As for *the new british poetry*, a fine book, but as uneven as any big
anthology could be. There's even some stuff in there that is sad and bad. I
personally enjoy the poems written in various dialects.

Such as Merle Collins' (from _Callaloo_)

I wish we had more of that, eh.

But then, I think we have a chance to make a new written language, and as
long as we don't take the plunge to abandon conventional English, we're all
just grinding our gears. Visual poetry, Language poetry, etc., are trying
to do a similar thing, but they sure aren't the only ways.

I'm with Suzanne on this. Hughes is as good a place to start as any.

Subject:      Vile, Nasty Animals
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

I think I was the one who mentioned the "nasty animals" in Hughes, so this
revival of the thread gives me an opportunity to elaborate a bit. Hughes'
nasty animal poems are relatively powerful because of the intensity with
which they convey remoteness, the sheer distance between the object of the
poem and what we like to think of as humanness (as laden with delusion and
wishful thinking as that concept may be). This is what might account for
their "darkness." To feel (however the mediating, romanticizing mechanisms
of the poem transmit the feeling) that we are being exposed to the
consciousness of a thing that exists only to kill, eat, and reproduce --
something that never needs to visit a therapist, take an aptitude test or
decide how to vote -- either enforces our alienation from what are after
all the core values of basic physical existence on the planet, or else
prompts the possible realization that yeah, take our jobs, e-mail, and
Subarus away and we'd be swooping down on tasty lil' bunnies all day, too.
Incidentally, for some reason it seems that the British are especially good
at writing poems that convey such alienating subject matter (or alienating
artifices of conveyance) -- think of Craig Raine and the "Martian School,"
even that old street-wandering ersatz-Englishman TSE himself.  Larkin, too
-- that remoteness, again; that awful cold -- but this time it's inside
permeating the "civilized" self and we can't just foist it off on the lowly
critters. The first American poet I think of who matches this feeling is
Stevens; in fact, I can't read _Crow_ without thinking of "13 Ways..."
True, I haven't read all of TH's  Plath poems yet, other than the ones in
the N'Yorker and elsewhere, but if they fall flat for me it's because
they're largely domestic monologs of the kind that take up most of the
poetry books and journals I see these days -- a notch more accomplished,
yes -- but remove the strictly personal history, the mythology of Ted and
Sylvia, and the voice too easily gets absorbed in the din of all the other
voices who have been mumbling those unremarkable "here's what happened to
me yesterday" poems/verse-diary-entries for decades. I respect Hughes as a
poet, but being Joe Human may just not be his strong suit. The man's more
at home when he's feeding the pike in his aquarium.

Subject:      crow

Crows play quite a part in poetry, don't they?  I think they're in the
early Russian folk epics a lot.  Mandelstam played with the name of the
town he was exiled in: Voronezh - as "voron"-"nozh" or raven knife, something
like that.  then there's Poe's famous poim.  Cautantowwit or Raven was
the chief god of the Narragansetts - ruler the land of the dead in the
southwest.  "as the crow flies".

Maybe one way to look at Hughes is as a poet who put on the mask of
wildness, the primitive - to break out of British civilization - only
to find experience - "ordinary" experience - more terrible than anything
he played with in his imagination... he's never been humbled, never eaten
crow - but maybe the crow ate him... (but I don't really know the story)

Yes, I also believe Hughes's crow flew out of Stevens (which I don't
intend as a knock on Hughes's crow, whom I esteem and have been
influenced by); but the precise poem by Stevens that I believe the crow
flew out of is the wonderful "No Possum, No Sop, No Taters."  Stevens's
bird was earlier in Frost, who got him from Hardy, who got him probably
from Shelley, who probably got him from Wordsworth, who didn't invent
him.

I think the anti-Hughes contingent is making the point that the
quality of Hughes' poetry is not commensurate with his position of
influence. And I think that is a legitimate point to be made. Suzanne also
raised some good points about the need for openness on the list (sorry I
can't quote it precisely) but I would only point out that many of the
people who are dismissing Hughes' recent work may have already read it
with an open mind and came to a conclusion with which I may not agree. THe
fact that they phrase these rejections strongly... well, polemic has a
long and honored tradition in literature, and I'm glad to see it's not
dead. Walt Whitman, hero to many on this list I'm sure, was once reviewed
by someone who said "Mr. Whitman is as acquainted with art as a hog is
with mathematics." I don't agree, history has proved this critic wrong,
but it's still a good line.
        Who knows. Perhaps as finnigan says Ted Hughes will still be read
in subsequent centuries. That doesn't mean occupants of the current one
need to restrain themselves from making critiques of his verse and his
person. And while Hughes isn't around these parts to defend himself, he
obviously has supporters who can and will.

Darkness may be essential - my feeling is that Hughes tapped something here
which his other (?more polished, more formal, niver?) poems don't touch.

?The dominant sense in [Rothenberg's] first book is of a 'dark traveler' who
journeys from 'darkness to darkness' and shares the fate he ascribes
to  all of us when he says, 'We love and we die in dark rooms.'  Yet
in his dream the darkness is beyond the room and he is compelled
to name it (_naming_ is a primary reative act) in order to open and
enter it.  He names it _Creation_, which, in fact, is what _White
Sun Black Sun_ names.  Though the book is dark, the darkness is
also creative ground (hence possibility), and writing the book,
Rothenberg has made good such possibility - _answered_ to it.  So
the darkness that surrounds us is aldso what Antin, in 'The first
blasck', a deep image poem he wrote at this time, considered the
origin.  'The sun and moon' he says are the ssigns of its clemancy."

I have lost the source of this quote.  If anyone recognizes (or
wrote) it please let me know.

In a message dated 98-02-18 14:57:03 EST, you write:

<< here's the full quote about the poetics list's "project" as stated in
 the welcome message.  i can't figure out why so many people can't seem
 to get their heads around it...

 "The definition of that project, while provisional, and while open to
 continual redefinition by list participants, is nonetheless aversive to
 a generalized discussion of poetry. Rather, our aim is to support,
 inform, and extend those directions in poetry that are committed to
 innovations, renovations, and investigations of form and/or/as content,
 to the questioning of received forms and styles, and to the creation of
 the otherwise unimagined, untried, unexpected, improbable, and
 impossible."

Charles, I certainly understand the desire that the list not become
unfocused. It has a defined mission. However, doesn't the list need
some essential tension? Many of us are readers of "innovative,
renovated, investigative" writing, but not wholly sold on it. You need
us, need our resistance--otherwise why would the message specify
"the otherwise, UNimagined, UNtried, UNexpected, IMprobable, and
IMpossible"?

I think when somebody makes quick hamburger of a Sacred Cow
of mainstream lit, they should be called on it. Asked to explain why?
Without stopping to think, to elaborate on one's response, the list would
be of no use to anyone, innovative or UNreformed.

aww Maria, you shdn't have gotten me started!

As Pierre wrote yesterday, the "most" (read "only") accessible Irby in book
form is _Call Steps_ (Station Hill/Tansy, 1992), available as always from SPD
(1-800-869-7553,  http://www.spdbooks.org/ ). That volume gathers material
from 1977-1979 & is a great place to start. The 2 poems in Apex of the M #6
(hi Kristen!) are knockouts --that should be readily findable. The chapbook
_Antiphonal & Fall to Fall_  (Kavyayantra, 1994) is the only book to gather
work written since then & is practically unavailable. I think there may be new
poems in the most recent First Intensity, but I just unearthed a resubscribe
notice sent last summer, so I don't have that issue at hand. Used copies of
_Relation_ (Black Sparrow, 1970) occasionally show up. *Somebody* should
reprint _To Max Douglas_ (Tansy 1971, 1974), _Archipelago_ (Tuumba, 1976), &
_Catalpa_ (Tansy, 1977) except that there are at least two unpublished mss.
from the 70's, and reams (?) of poems from the 80's & 90's. There are also
three very obscure early publications: _Kansas/New Mexico_  (Formula Series
Number One, Lawrence, 1965), _Movements /Sequences_ (Duende #8, 1965), and The
Flower Of Having Passed Through Paradise In A Dream_ (Matter, 1968).

Let me restate. The most recent full collection by Ken Irby gathers work
through 1979. There are now two decades worth of work that remains largely
inaccessible by a man who is repeatedly mentioned in conversation by many many
different writers of various stripes as one of the most highly underrated,
underpublished major (can I use that word?) poets in America today.
"Marginal," "Underground," "Fugitive" hardly suffice. The situation won't
change anytime in the near future.

I've spent most of today compiling the following list. There are the makings
for at least three books or more in it. The four reading/reviews would make a
great poetics book. (There are more early reviews in places like Kulchur,
Poetry, & Caterpillar.) There are tapes at Naropa of a class Ken taught in the
early 90's, on "The Elegiac" that are poorly organized but well worth
listening to. There may be tapes of a Whitman seminar he taught at the New
College in the mid/late 80's. I originally set out to just list recent pubs,
but realized that there is *so* much out there forgotten in journals that
really should be remembered -- so, it's a tad compulsive, though not complete.
Maybe someone will find it useful?

Only a true believer can know the truth. Or maybe you boys never got over
your transference neuroses. Or maybe this really is a matter of religion
and should be left alone. I opt for all three. But please don't accuse
those who disagree with you of derangement or ignorance.
Any further comments please backchannel. I value the list for what it does
well; I suspect this discussion is not one of those things.

--supposed to be irony?  These are Hughes'

Did they or did they not make a stone of

As someone who has written quite a bit about Sylvia Plath (and reviewed a
number of Hughes's books over the years), I'd like to throw my two cents
into this debate.

Ted Hughes, let's remember, burned Sylvia Plath's journals and reordered
her last poems so as to make her look more suicidal and depressed than she
actually was (see my essay on this in POETIC LICENSE).  It's uncanny how
he re-presented her work and made himself look better.  He also let out
the most dangerous poems when he edited ARIEL.

Now Hughes comes along and gives us "his side of the story."  What is his
explanation of Plath's "failure"?  Her father complex!  Come on, now!  How
banal can you get.  And the poems I've seen reproduced in the papers (I
haven't read the book yet) are embarrasingly banal and self-justifying.
What is disturbing is not that Hughes, whose work has been going down hill
for years) should have written these poems, but that the reviewers LOVE
THEM!  Call them "great works of art."  It's very depressing.  This is all
just biographical drivel and will have no staying power.  However, Hughes'
poems do serve to remind us how talented Plath herself was.  He only
wishes he could write 1/10 as well.

Another point:  I don't believe he wrote these poems "over the years."  I
think he wrote them just this last year or so in order to justify himself
and cash in on her death yet again!  And now he has succeeded.

I've never been able to sustain much interest in Ted Hughes' poetry, but
I do want to say that I quite like Larkin.  If form is only an extension
of content, then his non-PC views and his lyric style fit perfectly.
Perhaps it is overreading, but I take him to be not so vehement in his
reactionary curmudgeon pose, its a role he seems to have chosen, and
there is a certain wistfulness at having chosen that role, e.g., in the
poem about sex having been invented a little too late for him, or telling
the girls in the library to pull up their socks.  An interesting minor
poet.

"relentless I you autobiography," perhaps what is grating for some is
what happens when personal myth making becomes amplified by the mass
media.  the Diamond Sutra is better.

Hughes --

<< . . . "dark, archetypal" -- hmm, that's part of the problem, not part of
the solution. . . >>>

hmm, this utterance is prob. 1 part critique, 2 parts rhetorical flourish.
(Of course the reliance on radical '60s-ish formula is not to be missed; --
not glossed over, rather, glossed.)

The exclusivity -- either you're (a) or (b) [no overlap] -- is bracing in
its non-reconstructed [or non-deconstructed?] binarity.  hmmm

I am reading through a week's worth of digests,a comment to Robert Hale on
the number 4.

In Asian societies numerology is considered important to interpretaion of
events past, present and future.  In general, odd numbers are considered of
auspicious import and the even are not.  In Lanna Tai artistic iconography,
of which I can speak with some expertise, even-numbered elements are used
when fashioning funerary items.  Some believe that odd-numbered elements are
related to the human couple and the child; the extra factor in the pair
representing life which is auspicious in relation to death.

I am sure that one might be able to find many exceptions to this
interpretation, but, in the Chinese context, where numerology is a national
pasttime, the use of an inauspicious number in the mass iconography of
Maoist doctrine would not be an inconsequential phenomenon.

The most interesting aspect of Hughes work perhaps derives from D.H.
Lawrence. His work has been going downhill for years, in inverse
proportion to his status as official poet; the wildness turns to
nastiness.

I feel deeply embarrassed that I have been living in Lawrence for a few
years without even knowing that Irby was here, or having a full sense of
who he is, which is only gradually dawning on me from the list and my own
quick catch-up readings.  This is symptomatic of something else, though I
don't know exactly what.  In my defense I can only say that I spend as
little time in Kansas as humanly possible.

I wholeheartedly agree with this. One thing I regret about this thread is
that Plath has been lost somewhere in the margins. If this is a forum to
talk about innovation, we might want to look at what she has achieved,
rather than indulge in the usual, tired Hughes bashing.

How are you coming to this, Marjorie? Is it really unbelievable that
Hughes, who was married to Plath for heavens sake, would write about her,
however inadequately, over the years? I can't say anything about the
majority of the poems-- nor can anyone-- but it should be noted that about
eight or so have been published over the years. I believe one made it into
his selected, published about ten years ago.

I find it interesting that so much of the defense of Hughes centers around
issues of meaning and very little around whether he can, you should excuse
the expression, write.

I finally got my NYR last night and turned to the Fenton piece.  I was
astonished at how often Hughes' line seemed flaccid, how dull his rhythms,
how self-indulgent and predictable his language.  I wondered --- if his
long-dead wife had not been the famous poet Sylvia Plath, would people be
interested in these poems?  Occasionally something clean and focused came
through, but this was not the predominant impression.

My shelves are stacked with books of poets I want to read and haven't get
gotten around to.  Why should I or anyone else put time into reading
someone we don't like?

When you think of all the wonderful poets with great integrity who are
doing their damndest to manifest language/mind/world it is annoying, to say
the least, that they are ignored and someone like Hughes is honored.

The Hughes thread has been very interesting & I have enjoyed it all. I'm
not a great fan of his writing but as a teacher I have had to include it in
courses on post 1945 poetry, & so his reputation is also part of what we
all deal with when we read it. I reviewed the book for the local paper, so
that review is more general than perhaps it would have been for a more
klnowledgeable audience, but for the moment I stand by it. However, I would
add that the more I think about the poems, the more I have to add to Ron's
comment that they're 'necrophilic,' that I think, in the way that they are
collaborations with her poems, 'necromantic'...

The real problem, as I hint here, is that we can't read them for the
writing when the story, the myth, is so prevalent & powerful...

Birthday Letters by Ted Hughes. Faber & Faber, 198 pp., $25.00
        Birthday Letters, the latest book from Britain's poet laureate, Ted
Hughes, broke on the scene after no advance publicity and, according to a
report on CBC's This Morning, sold 40,000 copies in its first week of
publication. This did not happen because there has been a sudden upsurge of
interest in poetry, of whatever kind, in Britain. It happened because these
poems are clearly addressed to one of the most mythicized writers of the
twentieth century, Sylvia Plath, from one of the central figures, along
with her father, in that myth, the husband who has been demonized by
Plath's supporters during the 35 years since she committed suicide (as
Janet Malcolm points out in perhaps the finest study of this long
relationship, The Silent Woman). Says Malcolm: "To the readers of her
poetry and her biography, Sylvia Plath will always be young and in a rage
over Hughes's unfaithfulness." It is the continuing fascination with
Plath's work and death that fuels the immense interest in this book of
poems.
        The question that arises, then, an impossible question, I suspect,
is how to judge these poems as poems. Certainly, I can't pretend to do so
at this early point. But one of the reasons I can't is that Hughes has
chosen so clearly to write these poems as autobiography, and to address
them to a "you" who can be no other person than Plath. Moreover, they
insist on foregrounding an "I" who assumes at least as much importance as
the figure addressed. These poems emerge from a long tradition of lyric
elegy, wherein the speaker always gets the last word, whether meditating on
a single death or applying the lessons of that death to humanity in
general, yet most of them are narratives of memory, little stories of a
love affair destined to destruction. Readers of Plath's biographies will
recognize many of these moments, seen suddenly from a different
perspective. One of my problems with these poems is that, even though many
ask unanswerable questions, and even though Hughes (or his persona) accepts
a lot of blame for failing to comprehend his beloved's manic/melancholic
desperation, they all move to such a firm closure there seems to be no room
for further questioning on our parts.
        There are 88 poems here, so how exactly they are "Birthday Letters"
is not clear. Since Hughes has mantained a dignified silence about his
relation to Plath for so long, the obsessive, repetitive, and overwhelming
length of this book both repels and compels. Plath's anger, energy, fear,
and pain -- what he calls her "Panic" -- inform his every memory, and his
anguish is like a sore tooth he simply can't stop probing with his tongue.
The poems circle around their relationship from the period when they first
met to the present day (after all he has lived so much longer without her
than with her, but he has lived those years with her inheritence, both the
children and the writing). What can he say?
        Hughes has always been a highly symbolic writer, engaged with the
ancient mythic material of his birthplace, Yorkshire. In Birthday Letters,
the very private mythology that finally overwhelmed Plath threatens to
overwhelm him as well, and his only defence is to fight myth with myth.
These poems are dark dreams, frightening faery tales, demented legends full
of repeated themes and images, most of which can be found in Plath's poetry
or his own earlier work. The Plath industry will have a field day
deciphering them, but how well do they work as poems?
        It's hard to say. Hughes has always been a poet of analogy, and the
similes, the dark symbols, proliferate here. Although the poems appear to
speak with heartfelt honesty, they are, in fact, highly rhetorical
arguments. Portents abound, but often they descend into mere
portentousness, as in "Epiphany," wherein Hughes, with a clear allusion to
one of his own most famous poems, "The Thought-Fox," refuses to buy a fox
cub on the street and then wonders what would have happened if he "had paid
that pound and turned back / To you, with that armful of fox --".
If I had grasped that whatever comes with a fox
Is what tests a marriage and proves it a marriage --
I would not have failed the test. Would you have failed it?
But I failed. Our marriage had failed.
Yes, he takes blame here, but in such a strange manner, and this seems true
of all the poems where he does so. One of the most startling is the only
poem in which the woman for whom he left Plath enters their home. He spends
much of the poem explaining how "She fascinated you" and "Warily you
cultivated her," thus making the argument that Plath was as responsible for
her being there as he was, even if, at the end he admits that "I saw / The
dreamer in her / Had fallen in love with me and she did not know it. / That
moment the dreamer in me / Fell in love with her, and I knew it."
        The arguments are with Plath herself as much as with the readers.
Still, I responded most fully to those moments when he comes down to earth.
A line like "Our lives were still a raid on our own good luck" strikes
home. And in an early poem, he shows that he is aware that all that he is
doing is offering another version, not the 'true' or 'real' one. He has
been reading her journals:
Then, under the panic, the nightmare
That came rolling to crush you:
Your alternative -- the unthinkable
Old despair and the new agony
Melting into one familiar hell.
And then he realizes: "You are ten years dead. It is only a story. / Your
story. My story." This insight is important, but on the whole the poems
keep forgetting its lesson and press their message unironically.
        The real horror here, as far as their writer is concerned, is that
Plath's famous "Daddy," the father she sought and fought in her poems, was
a real presence in their lives, somehow: "While I slept he snuggled /
Shivering between us." The writer's failure, as he sees it, is that he
finally could not protect her from that ghost, nor free her from the
misapprehension that he was but another avatar of that fearful Daddy. That
the speaker of these poems loved, loves, the woman addressed throughout is
clear. What that love meant or means is not.
        There's another problem, though, one these references point to: are
these Hughes's poems? Or are they somehow still Plath's? Many are so full
of her imagery, her dark symbolism, if only because they are replies, that
it's hard to read them as anything but collaborations with the (perhaps
unwilling) dead.
        There are many off-putting moments, including the oddly inflected
description of her "monkey-elegant fingers" and "the African-lipped,
laughing, thickly / Crimson painted mouth." There is the mean-spirited
attack on the hyena-critics, especially those who have defended Plath
against him, who will undoubtedly be spending so much time on these poems
in years to come. There are poems that simply seem to be travelogues from
the marriage and add little to the ongoing argument the poet is having with
both his dead love and himself.
        Nevertheless, although I originally felt that less would have been
more in this case, and wished that the obsessive overindulgence of this
book had been brought under control, I have to admit that whatever power it
has derives from precisely its over the top sad, angry, self-explanatory,
argumentative desire to return, over and over again, to the moments when
their love and their mutual suffering threw such a strong light across
their shadowed lives. But in saying this, I am responding more to the
mythic gossip that has haunted contemporary poetic history since Plath's
suicide than to any particular quality of Hughes's poems. Still, whether or
not Birthday Letters is good poetry, it is a fascinating book.

For what it's worth...

well, i just felt obliged, pedantically speaking, in part b/c this list
seems to me so contentious of late:

Q:  Do you believe there's such a thing as "official verse culture"?
A:  Yes.

Q:  Does this mean that all that passes for official verse culture is
unappealing aesthetically, politically, etc?
A:  No.

Q:  How would you characterize official verse culture?
A:  In broad sweep, I'd point to the MLA-AWP interface.  I'd have folks
read the MLA Job List---to see how academic institutions assign value to
creative writing when the chips are down and they need to hire
someone---and I'd have them peruse AWP Chronicle---to note the way the
literary is deployed and "contested" in articles and, well, contests.

Q: Does this mean that all MFA programs and all AWP activities are suspect?
A: No.

Q:  How would you characterize the MLA-AWP problem?
A:  In terms of an archaic reliance on older notions of "craft," "voice"; a
certain anti-postmodern/anti-poststructural sentiment; and in general a
resistance to newer pedagogies (Freirean, etc.).

Q: Does this mean that the state of contemporary poetry (and poetics) in
North American postsecondary institutions is tenuous?
A:  Yes.

Q:  Can you offer any immediate proof of this?
A:  My most immediate proof would be anecdotal:  the vast number of English
professors I'm met who can't name even a half-dozen contemporary poets, and
who have no working vocabulary for the specifically *poetic* status of
their claims.

Q:  Does this have anything at all to do with the general state of poetry
in North America?
A:  Yes.

Q:  Does the general state of poetry in North America have anything to do
with current publishing realities---mergers, acquisitions, and so forth?
A:  Yes.

Q:  With the relative collapse of the small press distribution system?
A:  Yes.

Q:  Will poetry wither on the North American cultural vine?
A:  No.  People will continue to write it.

Q:  What's your greatest fear then?
A:  That we continue to produce a public domain that is
unresponsive---politically, aesthetically, socially---to the poetry (and
art) of so many of its citizens.  My concerns have to do with the cultural
influence of a practice that I consider valuable---the influence it might
have, as might other arts, in humanizing (or post-humanizing) our public
practices.

Q:  Doesn't this imply a rather ambitious social agenda on your part, esp.
wrt the arts?
A:  Yes.

Q:  Does the educational system have anything to do with your agenda?
A:  Yes.

Q:  Do electronic networking technologies provide hope for a more
distributive, more diverse set of poetic practices?
A:  Yes.

Q:  Do electronic networking technologies augur a possible threat of social
control?
A:  Yes.

Q:  What is your greatest fear re electronic technologies?
A:  That the social structures that currently enforce regulation and
compliance to assorted norms (incl. my professional home---academe) manage
to seize control of these technologies to augment their power.

Q:  Are electronic technologies new?
A:  In some ways.

Q:  Are electronic technologies simply a new version of an older way of
thinking?
A:  Sometimes.

fairly dim in the US in recent years, in part (i believe) to the spate of
plath bios that rarely portray him in a favorable light. in college in mid
70's, my professors wld proclaim hughes "the best poet writining english
today" (the kind of pronouncement that new critic trained profs loved to
make)-- none of my creative writing students have ever heard of him before
the controversey (or Robert Lowell, for that matter). Nomatter how sorid
the issue, mainstream poetry is a topic of controversey and conversation.

this issue also seems a boost for "old-school" essentialist feminism-- who
nevr bought into recent french-influenced feminism --and who had made plath
into a central icon -- haven't heard Robin Morgan's name evoked in a
while!! --

re: Philip Larkin--i'll reccomend his "all what jazz" as a really hilarious
book -- essentially the adventures of a mouldy fig (jazz term for a musical
square) trying to make sense of albert ayler, eric doplphy and, even,
charlie parker (who thought was too strident & had a lousy tone" he finally
gave it up in early 70's.

For Ken Irby's poetry, you might also take
a look at the selection in FROM THE OTHER SIDE
OF THE CENTURY: A NEW AMERICAN POETRY..., which
also lists all of his titles in the back.

here on the cape, the crows are taking over. the place i'm staying used to
be a bird sanctuary and filled w/ all kinds of incredible sounds. now it's
mostly crows.  i've had an onus against them since one of them ate some
baby robins right outside my kitchen door a few years ago; the sight of
that crow resting on the ground, beak slightly parted after the deed, and
the sound of the parent robins shrieking wildly, has been pretty haunting.

Exactly. Why read someone you don't like, bash someone you haven't read,
or waste bandwidth on subjects that don't interest you ....

And yet... 'scuse me for being mischievous because I'm really not into
Hughes's work all that much and have many of the same issues with his
writing that you have, but isn't it interesting how LONG this thread
has been?

Jacqueline Rose's book about Plath opens with a quote from her journals
in which she wonders why everybody is talking so much about that damned
Eddie Fisher/ Debbie Reynolds thing.... wish I had the quote in front of
me. It seems to apply. As for "necrophilia", well I have used that word
before to describe a number of Plathies I've met....

Why does this fascinate? Why does everybody and their dog want to get
their two-cents in?

does this passage remind others of nights in high school spent translating
ovid or some other classical poet? it strikes me as having the flavor of a
clumsy translation of some classic rhetorical figure.  i haven't followed
the hughes story in the news, but i'm wondering if the appearance of this
book is related to or was catalyzed in some by the diana poem he produced;
the themes are similar (the death of a beautiful young woman --hmm, why
does poe come to mind).  maybe that's just too cheap a shot, in which case
i take it back; i do respect his early work, at least what i remember of
it.

Judy, thanks for answering Michael's query with such snappy brevity. Yes,
it was the "I" "you" thing I was critiquing.  Not to go on and on about my
own work--but autobiography and exploring notions of the self are the
central issues in my own writing.  Obviously I'm rather opinionated on the
topic.  Also of central concern to me is the Dark and the Archetypal.  The
greatest challenge for me in writing The Letters of Mina Harker was how to
reinvent (or to be more modest, work with) these tropes in a way that
wasn't hokey--also in a way that delights in their hokey potential but goes
beyond mere parody.

Dark and Archetypal can be just as dreadfully cliched as anything else, and
I imagine that's what Pierre's critique is about--not that he's afraid of
those realms.  Look at some of the dreadful poetry coming out of Jungian
psychology.  "Let's march down into The Tunnel and smear some Blood on us."
With Plath there is the sense that this stuff is really dangerous and she's
always trying to keep in down and it keeps breaking out anyway--and that
gives a lot of energy to her work.  Risk.

And lots of fragmentation.  None of this "I am Dark, Archetypal, and
Unified."  My problem with Hughes' autobiography in The Birthday Letters
(since I'm not familiar with the rest of his work, and maybe he stretches
more elsewhere) is that there is no questioning of the self, of simple
issues like who is speaking, who is being spoken to, no sense of the self
as a performance, no hint of the self as not being this unified entity.
Plath comes across as schizzy and unpredictable, but through Hughes'
unified eye.

One of the great pleasures I get from reading Plath--and something I've
learned a lot from reading her--is this notion of the self as a
performance.  One doesn't often get the sense of Sylvia Plath seeing the
world outside her window--one gets the sense of these psychic fragments
searching desperately for embodiment.  Even the dreaded Daddy poem is
marvelous as a performance.  It confuses me why this poem isn't seen as a
performance.  This isn't Sylvia being honest, this is Sylvia "doing" rage.

Sorry to go on and on.  You know how it is when fans start talking.

Dodie

Perhaps as a segue into Plath (from her diary, which is perhaps hard to
find, but in libraries certainly...):

The Preface to The Diary, by Ted Hughes (my edition is The Dial Press,
1982):

....One can compare what was really going on in her to a process
of alchemy.
Her apprentice writings were like impurities thrown off from the
various stages of the inner transformation, by-products of the internal
work. One really can use these terms in her case..... But what did she
want? In a different culture, perhaps, she would have been happier. There
was something about her reminiscent of what one reads of Islamic fanatic
lovers of God -- a craving to strip away everything from some ultimate
intensity, some cummunion with spirit, or with reality, or simply with
intensity itself. She showed something violent in this, something very
primitive, perhaps very female, a readiness, even a need, to sacrific
everything to the new birth. With her, this was vividly formulated at
every level of her being. The negative phase of it, logically, is suicide.
But the positive phase (more familar in religious terms) is the death of
the old false self in the birth of the new and real one. And this is what
she finally did achieve, after a long and painful labor.
        ARIEL and the associated later poems give us the voice of that
self. They are the proof that it arrived. All her other writings, except
these journals, are the waste products of its gestation.
        Sylvia Plath was a person of many masks, both in her personal life
and in her writings. Some were camouflage cliche facades, defensive
mechanisms, involuntary. And some were deliberate poses, attempts to find
the keys to one style or another. These were the visible faces of her
lesser selves, her false or provisional selves, the minor roles of her
inner drama. Though I spent every day with her for six years, and was
rarely separated from her for more than two or three hours at a time, I
never saw her show her real self to anybody--except, perhaps, in the last
three months of her life.
        Her real self had showed itself in her writing, just for a moment,
three years earlier, and when I heard it--the self I had married, after
all, and lived with and knew well--in that brief moment, three lines
recited as she went through a doorway, I knew what I had always felt must
happen and had now begun to happen, that her real self, ebing the real
poet, would now speak for itself, and would throw off all those lesser and
artificial selves that had monopolized the the words up to that point, it
was as if a dumb person suddenly spoke.
        A real self, as we know, is a rare thing. The direct speech of a
real self is rarer still. Where a real self exists it reveals itself, as a
rule, only in the quality of the person's presence, or in actions....When
a eal self finds language, and manages to speak, it is surely a dazzling
event--as ARIEL was.
        {Then a paragraph positing that although the poems of ARIEL are
the products of her real self, they don't truly represent the day-to-day
dramas that led up to their composition...}
        This is where her journals demonstrate their difference in kind
from all her other writings. Here she set down her day to day struggle
with her warring selves, for herself only. This is her autobiography, far
from comlete, but complex and accurate, where she strove to see herself
honestly and fought her way through the unmaking and remaking of herself.
Ad the Sylvia Plath we can divine here is the closest we can now get to
the real person in her daily life.
        The journals exist in an assortment of notebooks and bunches of
loose sheets. This selection contains perhaps a third of the whole bulk,
which is now in the Neilson Library at Smith College. Two more notebooks
survived for a while, maroon-backed ledgers like the '57-'59 volume, and
continued the record from late '59 to within three days of her death. The
last of these contained entires for several months, and I destroyed it
because I did not want her children to have read it (in those days I
regarded forgetfulness as an essential part of survival). The other
disappeared.

!!!

So, some thoughts:

1. Let's just speculate that the diary that Hughes destroyed said lots of
nasty things about him and hs philandering--would these new poems have
even been possible? Would he have had the nerve to publish them in a such
a way? How has Plath's Hughes-induced silence (the lost journals) allowed
him to publish this volume?

2. Notice the way in which Hughes contructs a world in which he figures as
a sort of absent father-figure: the description of the birthing and
sloughing off of her selves (withHughes simply standing by to witness);
the excuse that Hughes profers of saving "her" children from the grief
that her final journal may have caused; the incredible insistence that
though he was present and by her side at all times, none of what happened
to her was ultimately caused by this presence--and so on.

3. By writing such a shamefully blatant attempt to excuse himself from the
scene of any number of "crimes of and against the Self" as he construes it
here, doesn't he in some sense erase any legitimate connection between The
Plath as we now see her and his own body of work? HE DESTROYED AN ENTIRE
NOTEBOOK of her writing! He claims to have had no part in the "emergence"
of this "real Self" of hers--who cares how many years these new works took
him to write--if he insists on foregrounding Plath's suicide yet again
(and to his own advantage) then yes, I think we should again begin to
discuss HER work--

Regards,
Katy

Maria,

Is your "this passage" mine or Hughes' lines?  If Hughes',
then the "clumsy translation," or the incredible
deafness in a poet laureate, is of Yeats--the stone
in the changing stream.  You read him in high school.

I'm probably putting myself in harm's way here. I care little for Hughes'
work, and not a lot for Plath's. But this aspect of her cult (not her
poems) has always disturbed me: that she was not responsible for her
suicide. The suicide of someone who is physically healthy, and who leaves
children behind to come to terms with it, is a fairly strong statement. To
strip Plath of responsibility for hers is to strip her of much of her dignity.

One further point before I go into hiding. Hughes' "in those days I
regarded forgetfulness as an essential part of survival" reads to me as an
admission that if he had been in his right mind at the time he would have
found another way to protect his children from the destroyed journal. There
certainly is no excuse for destroying anyone's work, but it's not hard to
understand the impulse. Suicide is the unanswerable argument, the ultimate
weapon, the nastiest thing that one can do to one's survivors, and Hughes,
with his many faults, had just been zapped.

It's worth remembering that a suicide's surviving family members have an
astronomically higher likelihood of resorting to suicide themselves. Quite
a legacy.

Billy --

thanks for b.c. copying me on this; I generally / sometimes read Poetics in
digest (as has been just now), so won't know (till the big computer deigns
to send me, now, an unfinished update) what (if anything) has been further
said in this thread.

To your point, though --

my description ("radical '60s-ish formula") was vague to the point of
obscuring the intention -- which was merely as description, not as critique
as such.  That is, if I knew that it was, say, Angela Davis (??) / Eldridge
Cleaver (??) who had minted that adage, I could more usefully have (mildly)
more meaningfully have written, "Davis's adage" -- but that, still, would
merely be a matter of description -- i.e., tagging the adage to its origins,
for (at least) historical interest.

As for the meaningfulness of said adage --

   if you're not part of the solution,
   you're part of the problem

its "binarity" (presumably a neolgism there) is what I was (mildly, at most)
calling into quasi-question.

Following (at least, say) Gautama's lead, one might infer that (from certain
p.o.v.'s) nobody's ever a part of the solution who hasn't been (or, perhaps,
isn't) also part of the problem.  One must be within the muck to do anything
with the muck, that is.  But no doubt I write too broadly.

I'm no great admirer of George Will's, btw.  Used to enjoy some of his
comumns abt. 15 years ago, but not since.

cheerz,
d.i.

p.s.:  Regarding "dark archetypal", -- well, okay, I've got a weakness for
that stuff in poetry.  I've been a tad more interested in other things from
Hughes than what I've seen of the Plath poems so far; and will admit to
having liked one or two poems of James Fenton's (and, more, some of his
journalistic stuff -- which he does w/ great regularity for the NYRoB).
Presumably Hughes is, to some degree, in debt to the (perhaps
underappreciated?) Robert Graves, dark-arch-wise . . . ; anyway, give me
dark-arch, or give me death.  (hmm, maybe they're six o' one . . ?)

Not too fond of that quote from his preface about "Islamic fanatic lovers

Mark,

I agree that there is no excuse for suicide--and most of what you say
below as regards Plath's actual suicide--

What I'm trying to say is that Hughes' publishing of his "necro-erotic"
work decades after the fact appears tasteless and somehow contrary to the
terms he sets up for himself in the Preface quoted earlier--

More to the point, however, I was trying to say that I agreed with Chris
that we should, perhaps, use this opportunity to discuss her work--or
perhaps to discuss larger issues such as to what degree biography and
poetry intersect and so on...not to discuss Hughes' "lameness" etc....

Also: I just thought that this Preface was terribly interesting--really
provocative stuff--and probably hadn't been read by most people on this
list and/or elsewhere--

Best,
Katy

Also:

How is Plath's suicide being figured in terms of gender here? The notion
that she left behind children etc...

I can think of a number of male poets throughout history who have killed
themselves in one way or another and been figured to be heroic--

Certainly they have not been admonished for "leaving children behind" etc
in the same way that Plath has--

What if Plath had been the father? Hughes a cheating-on-spouse,
non-writing mother? I suspect (it's obvious, really) that the discourse
would be altogether different--

Joe, you made many good points, but allow me to pick at a few
of your Q&As:

 Q:  Do you believe there's such a thing as "official verse culture"?
 A:  Yes.

-----Yes, and all ages have had some vaguely definable "official verse
culture,"
so I'm not certain this description hasn't become anything more than a
stock response.

 Q:  How would you characterize official verse culture?
 A:  In broad sweep, I'd point to the MLA-AWP interface.  I'd have folks
 read the MLA Job List---to see how academic institutions assign value to
 creative writing when the chips are down and they need to hire
 someone---and I'd have them peruse AWP Chronicle---to note the way the
 literary is deployed and "contested" in articles and, well, contests.

 Q:  How would you characterize the MLA-AWP problem?
 A:  In terms of an archaic reliance on older notions of "craft," "voice"; a
 certain anti-postmodern/anti-poststructural sentiment; and in general a
 resistance to newer pedagogies (Freirean, etc.).

-----This close identification of MLA and AWP seems somewhat odd
to me. MLA, judging from some of the conference propaganda Ive seen,
doesn't strike me as an organization deadset against post mo & post-
struralism. AWP's a rather different kind of outfit--one meant to serve
students & their teachers in the college/univ.-based writing programs.
AWP I dont think of as cause so much as it is manifestation of its
constituency.

 Q: Does this mean that the state of contemporary poetry (and poetics) in
 North American postsecondary institutions is tenuous?
 A:  Yes.

 Q:  Can you offer any immediate proof of this?
 A:  My most immediate proof would be anecdotal:  the vast number of English
 professors I'm met who can't name even a half-dozen contemporary poets, and
 who have no working vocabulary for the specifically *poetic* status of
 their claims.

 Q:  Does this have anything at all to do with the general state of poetry
 in North America?
 A:  Yes.

----I think it can be acknowledged that there is so such thing as a general
readership for contemp poetry--not for the mainstream, not for the innovative,
nor for the new formalists. That most English profs can't name 6 contemporary
poets is sad. Then again, no profession/group could, other than we contemp
poets, which gets into the circularity of no readers/no recognition.

 Q:  Does the general state of poetry in North America have anything to do
 with current publishing realities---mergers, acquisitions, and so forth?
 A:  Yes.

---If any group was hurt by big biz events that began in 80s and have
continued off & on since, it's been mainstream poets. Random House takes
over Knopf, & some marginal mainstreamers (often worthy poets) get dropped.
A Levine, Merwin, Hecht survive...but a Donald Finkel doesn't make the cut.
The more innovative poets were never on the lists to begin with. I dont
believe
any unfeeling conglomerates went after The Figures or Telephone Books.
Douglas Messerli can rest easy--no MBAs are plotting to take over Sun &
Moon and force him to do cookbooks & self-helps.

Q:  With the relative collapse of the small press distribution system?
A:  Yes.

Q:  Will poetry wither on the North American cultural vine?
A:  No.  People will continue to write it.

Again, it gets back to readers. Yes, we'll write it, but will it be read
in sufficient quantities to support the likes of SPD? Perhaps, the new
technologies you refer to may, in time, offer some relief to the distribution
woes of small press. Perhaps will get an "Altermazon.com," so to speak.
The new technologies relieving some of the overhead burdens and variable
costs (inventory, brick & mortar, returns, catalog printing, etc.) borne
by distributors.

Interesting, that Orientalizing tendency apparent in the poems I read began
early:

Frankly, with a person who viewed me this way in my face non-stop for six

heroic in / for suicide, do you mean?  Could you name one?  (I'm not aware
of entertaining that idea abt. anybody, truth to tell.)

The legend of Li Po's (possible) drowning in river, looking for the moon,
seems a romanticized myth (hinting at the suicide question maybe), but I
don't know that he's considered heroic for that . . .  who else?  Not to put
you on the spot, -- just that I can't think of such examples.

Katy:
As to your two transmissions, I'm in total agreement with the first. As to
your second, "How is Plath's suicide being figured in terms of gender here?
The notion that she left behind children etc... I can think of a number of
male poets throughout history who have killed themselves in one way or
another and been figured to be heroic-- Certainly they have not been
admonished for "leaving children behind" etc in the same way that Plath
has-- What if Plath had been the father? Hughes a cheating-on-spouse,
non-writing mother? I suspect (it's obvious, really) that the discourse
would be altogether different--," it's not at all obvious to me that
there's a gender difference of the kind you suggest here. First,
self-destructive behavior is not the same as suicide, nor does it have the
same impact on surviving children. I raised Paul Blackburn's son. Paul
could be said to have killed himself with cigarettes and booze, but that
was not his patent intention, nor did Carlos feel abandoned therefor or
given permission to do likewise. Second, in your hypothetical scenario (I
guess) Plath cheats on Hughes who kills himself in response, public
reaction would certainly be different for reasons that have a lot to do
with gender as construed in our society, but I think in the following
manner: a. killing oneself for love is unmanly (women aren't that
important); b. killing oneself is more acceptable in women, especially if
done in a non-violent way (which may be why suicide attempts are far more
common in adolescent girls than in adolescent boys).

finnegan---more friendly would be james, yes?---james, thanx for picking up
on my q & a, which i intend to be provocative... but which at the same time
i posted b/c i was feeling pinched by certain discussions hereabouts...

"official verse culture":  well though i think that it's important to call
out power centers as such... i've been in far too many contexts where
official verse culture---or its equivalent in fiction or nonfiction
circles---has acted as a gag both on my aesthetic sensibility and on my
capacity to express my discomfort... if you ain't been there, then perhaps,
perhaps you don't know what i mean... but if you *have* been there, as i
suspect you have, then i probably don't have to say much more... "there" is
where good and proper poetry is such & such, period... of course, to define
the contours of official verse culture today might be difficult, but i
believe it can be done... i think in fact jed rasula manages it in _the
american poetry wax museum_, a book that---whatever the flaws r.
kostelanetz has managed to find recently (his short review in the recent
and final _poetic briefs_ that i am extremely grateful to have rec'd)---is
not afraid to call the more powerful political alliances ("institutional
consolidations" is rasula's term as i recall) that have served to represent
and legitimate poetry and poetic practice in north america... and of course
a major actor in this representative practice has been the english dept...

awp and mla are in cahoots---so to speak (i'm somewhat less interested in
motive than in effects)---in that awp "sanctions" writing programs that
become in many cases the primary embodiment of the mla membership's
understanding of creative writing... i.e., how said orientation manifests
itself, not least in its job lists... that this is to personify the
organizational is ok imho... but it's more than simply the job lists---it's
also insofar as the way english profs, incl. creative writers, are educated
about their own profession, their own professional and poetic practices
(both to the extent that the poetic is professional, and to the extent that
it isn't)... about how (e.g.) scholarship is to be conducted (this way and
not that)... about how (e.g.) teachers come to think of their role in
educating students... there have to be SOME historical and determinate
reasons why i experience the english profession the way i do---and i'm not
alone... sure, the postmodern/poststructural nexus has been endorsed now by
mla, current backlash aside... just be sure to write it in sentences!...
and when you're in the process of elaborating on Major Cultural Happenings,
just be sure to exclude poets and poetry...

on the avg, now... i'd hate to name recent books, but i will if asked...
and when i rail against sentences, i'm not unaware that i'm in the process
of trying to scribble same!...

in short:  mla as a professional society is surely in large part
responsible for the way its members come to their professional work (pmla
being a prime outlet and example)... interesting to have a look at
profession 97 in this regard---the poetry forum... which poets were chosen
to speak, how these poets spoke, what trends in poetry they represented...
and of course, what wasn't said, what wasn't represented...

digression:  used to be that ncte represented an alternative to mla in that
it was interested in talking pedagogy... now that cccc has dried-up as a
job convention, though, it's clear that mla has wrested some control back
of composition pedagogy... reason i mention this is to indicate the ways in
which prof. organizations are situated in terms of professional
practices... so it should come as no surprise that i point at mla in toto,
though of course we poets who teach, most of us, are part of this
totality... and though of course each of us may represent diverse
motivations and such like... i take your point about awp and mla being
different beasts, but again---strong affiliations persist...

as you suggest, one might observe that mainstream poets are hit hard by all
of the publishing problems (e.g.) too, that 'we're all in this together' or
some such... some would therefore argue that any talk of mainstream vs.
alternative is divisive... but i'll defer to my observation in my first
para---the one about my discomfort at having to swallow my... thoughts
(which, if you know me, i'm none too good at) when it comes to talking
about things poetic in the presence of certain educated souls... broad
brush  is necessary here, i think... sure, i've met many more mainstream
poets i like, whose work i like and admire... that many have access to an
awards network, say, that i *might* enjoy mself---that not a few often
exude a pedigree that i'll never exude, much like many of the mla hotshots
whom 'we' regularly elect to office (have a close look at those bios
sometime, if you haven't already)---is less important to me (REALLY) than
that i read their work, but that many don't read the work of those i also
admire, those who are not mainstream... and are often condescending in this
regard...

there are many factions here of course and i don't wish to set up a
binary... at the same time, i *do* think that it's damned important to talk
about the general per- and reception of poetry and the arts in the u.s. (by
non-poets, and non-artists) and why this per/reception continues in the
face of the very realities that you and i both know, james, are choking the
life out of certain aesthetic talents... nea cutbacks, yes, but perhaps
more profoundly and as i just posted to another list a week back, the fact
that no less than three of my first-year writing students argued in class
the other day that the best way to make for profound social transformation
is to invest in the stock market---no shit... "we shouldn't be afraid to
throw 50 million at theoretical physics," one student remarked, whereas his
first response to funding artists as a social program was "why?---so they
can paint?"... hey --- it's not just that i'm on a tech campus...

the reality is, i think, that though poets, mainstream and alternative,
will continue to write poetry, public attitudes (both in and out of the
educational institution) are making it damned difficult for many of us to
continue to eek our contributions forth, and making it systemically
difficult for the emergence of pathways that will permit such eeking to
continue into the larger public domains... and when push comes to shove,
those who advocate, implicitly and often explicitly, a more mainstream
poetic (which again, is often anti-theoretical at its core)---which i have
no problem at all placing under my AWP broad-brush (please:  apologies to
my allies and friends there, but i must be blunt)---are i think doing a
disservice to those who don't "fit" that poetic, and perhaps---speculation
here that i'll leave at that for now---vitiating a more urgent and critical
public response to things poetic b/c of said advocacy...

my fullest response to this issue, as i've posted here before, at
http://www.iit.edu/~amato/moonlight.html

the internet is one way to help along alternative practices, and i believe
it can help (both formally and politically)... it can hurt too---it no
doubt will, has... but it's gonna be a struggle, and i'm getting too old to
believe that everything good in life MUST come hard...

i'm an ambitious guy, like i say... on the other hand, why not be?...

best, rambling///

Speaking of nastiness on nastiness, my favorite poem by Hughes is called
"The Love Pet." Despite what we may or may not say about the progressiveness
of Hughe's language, that poem "feels" exactly like what my divorce was
like. In fact, now that I think about it, NONE of the language associated
with my divorce was particularly interesting... :) But animal nastiness--o
yes, loads and loads and loads...

I guess interesting language is safely reserved for those among us not
savagely at war with lawyers and bitter lovers.

And if Mr. Larkin didn't care for Charlie Parker, he was no kind of jazz
fan. Charlie Parker's music is the great text of pleasure.

I am not a critic, so I will not discuss, in this context, the literary
merits of Hughes' work.  However, I simply cannot resist making an
observation.

I consider his last publication in incredibly poor taste.  If he had written
a prose autobiography focusing upon his relationship with Sylvia Plath, I
would have given him the benefit of the doubt, but, he seems to me a poet
hiding behind poetry to use it for his defense.  This seems to be unethical
behaviour, the fact of which his guilt or innocence in the manipulation of
Plath's life and work would not change.

Subject:      TROPE OF DARKNESS and adjectives
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

As per some recent posts, I recall a discussion of the use of the word
"darkness" in a poetry workshop with Joel Lewis.

Someone in the group used the word in a poem and Joel brought up some
problems associated with it, such as its 19th Century feel. In the case of
the workshop, this word was working against a poem that was otherwise
struggling to begin with, as workshop poems often are (you have to begin
somewhere, but not, perhaps, with darkness, especially in a confessional poem).

Some tropes of "darkness" can be traced quite readily to Conrad -- to sight
and its impossibility, as Marlow narrates in "The Heart of Darkness":

"that Kurtz who at the time I did not see -- you understand. He was just a
word for me. I did not see the man in the name any more than you do. Do you
see him? Do you see the story? Do you see anything?"

We're talking about referents with referentiality -- a dicey business for
any level of poetry, workshop or, how shall I say, advanced (?) that is
trying to make the reader see something. We're also inevitably talking about
"the horror" :

that people lie to establish a condition of truth

and that there is a tension between the phrase and every translation
compelled to resolve it.

What was Kurtz thinking? We'll never know. And let's not forget Conrad's
obsession with "making the reader see" as he said in an oft-sited intro to
one of his novels, The Nigger of the Narcissus.

So "darkness" and "horror", fields of referentiality obviously still
relevant, but better pursued through other adjectives or none at all or
perhaps ripe for repetition, chants and incantations, along with Kurtz,
which is when you know, I suppose, what he was thinking when he repeated it
twice with exclamation points.

Herodotus is a strange reference here. As you read his "Histories" notice
the lack of adjectives. One of the West's earliest prose writers knew about
these trappings and/or was perhaps merely following rules of grammar.

Try limiting yourself to one adjective every 500 words or so and see what
happens. Let's not call it "experimental" poetry for obvious reasons.

If one were inclined to analyze writers it would appear that there
might be material here for a Jungian approach rather than Freudin
or Lacanian, esp. in view of his animal poetry (actually Hillman
might be more fitting.?  archetype, darkness, anima, animus, hmm.

What about conceiving a poem as a series of "stops"?  (I'm currently writing
one with that title.) The idea being that each line should be so constructed
as to give the reader pause , each line in effect enacting a Brechtian
interruption or occasion for a renewed meditation.
I'm new to the list and hopeful that this might be a somewhat different spin
on things.

I have the feeling that analyzing the Plath/Hughes reality from either a
male or female perspective is a kind of trap, an endless circle of
dissection and blame.  Far more interesting to look at how Plath's
poetry radiates more skill, fascination, intensity, mana than Hughes -
BECAUSE she echoes the patriarchal tradition in her work more closely
and more scrupulously (from a standpoint of conflict).  Hughes is unfaithful.
Plath kills herself. Hughes destroys some of her notebooks.  And we
sit in judgement, archivists mourning the aborted manuscripts.

Even more intersting might be to think about the Plath/Hughes tragedy
using a another lens - not feminism or masculinism but neutral, generic
lit history: i.e., the fate of that generation of writers in English
coming after the modernists & after WW 2 and the Holocaust.  Where did
poets "stand" after Pound Eliot Joyce et al created a complete "counter"
tradition - which then became THE tradition?  Basically the next generation
was devoured by their forebears (psychologically overshadowed) - and they
worked under the sign of self-destruction & loss of control (Berryman,
Lowell, Plath, Sexton, Dylan Thomas, Delmore Schwartz, Crane, etc. etc...);
they became the manic underside (still Establishment) of the new Pax
Americana.  So how is poetry in that poisoned atmosphere a kind of
fatal gift or death-talisman that has to be acted out to the end? (supposedly)
& how much of that do we both participate in and fail to see - while
trying to measure out blame with teaspoons?  Traditional Verse Culture
self-destructed 2 generations ago and we're still working out the
funeral arrangements.

I am reading through a week's worth of digests,a comment to Robert Hale =
on
the number 4.

In Asian societies numerology is considered important to interpretaion =
of
events past, present and future.  In general, odd numbers are considered =
of
auspicious import and the even are not.  In Lanna Tai artistic =
iconography,
of which I can speak with some expertise, even-numbered elements are =
used
when fashioning funerary items.  Some believe that odd-numbered elements =
are
related to the human couple and the child; the extra factor in the pair
representing life which is auspicious in relation to death.

I am sure that one might be able to find many exceptions to this
interpretation, but, in the Chinese context, where numerology is a =
national
pasttime, the use of an inauspicious number in the mass iconography of
Maoist doctrine would not be an inconsequential phenomenon.

The first male suicide who came to my mind was John Berryman (--I wonder
if the list is generally pro or con Berryman?) There is a harrowing book
about his life & suicide by John Haffenden--in the end you feel relieved
Berryman's finally done away with himself, he was SO miserable. I never
get that sense from Plath--she just always seems enraged.

But I do think Mark Weiss raises the most compelling reason not to
suicide: all of the people I've ever know who have been continuously &
hauntingly tempted by suicide are the children of suicides. Mom or Dad,
it doesn't seem to matter. It's as if they've never had the option of
seeing the act as inconceivable.

And thank you, Katy, for the image of Ted Hughes in a dowdy housedress!

     Awhile back, someone posted to the list that they were disappointed we
     didn't discuss specific books of poetry.  That person (can't remember
     who it was) suggested discussing FRAME by Watten. Since, I only read a
     couple of his poems in an anthology, I wasn't very familiar with him.

     I did get a chance to read FRAME and found it delightful.  Watten is
     experimental and challenging.  One of my fave poems was "Barnaby
     Jones." Don't know when it was written but assume it was in the 1980's
     when the TV show was popular.  Watten, in the poem, compares Barnaby
     Jones and Dragnet--extremely inventive and funny.  Who says
     experimental poetry can't have a sense of humor.

     Thanks to you whoever recommended Watten.

Hi, Katy:

Could you please tell us who those male poets are who "killed themselves in one
way or another and been figured to be heroic"? My own sense is that this simply
isn't true, but realize it's just "a sense" I have.

When I'd read that Richard Brautigan committed suicide I was very upset, had
just finished _So the Wind Won't Blow It All Away_, thought more would be
coming, couldn't understand why he'd did it. Keith Abbott's book on Brautigan,
as I remember it, hardly cast Brautigan as a hero; my memory of Abbott's
portrayal of Brautigan was that B. was a self-involved substance abuser,
obsessed with fame, bitter over waning critical attention & audience in the
U.S., his suicide (as cast by Abbott) as pointless, if inevitable (given
Brautigan's increasingly negative frame of mind). Reading Lew Welch's letters
(_I Remain_), it's baffling as to why, once he'd been set up in a cabin,
seemingly had all the time in the world to write (time being a constant problem
for Welch), he chose then to "give up." I certainly don't--& no one I've read
or talked with does--cast his apparent suicide as "heroic." I'm not that well
acquainted with Berryman's work, or whatever discourse surrounds it, but I've
never heard or read anyone calling him a hero for leaping into the Mississippi.
The only more-or-less contemporary instance I can think of is in the discourse
surrounding d.a. levy's suicide--and there what you'll get are people who
believe he was either driven to it by the local authorities (this was in
Cleveland, in the 60s--levy, Jim Lowell & others were consistently hassled,
jailed, & generally watched), or actually murdered by them. In that instance,
the narrative seems to be less about the suicide itself than the constant
hassles--people talk about his death in the way people talk about that of Lenny
Bruce.

I have to admit that, while I'm a reader & admirer of Plath's poetry, I haven't
read much of the secondary material, and am not sure how, say, a professional
critic is likely to think and write about her suicide. I do know that a few of
the people I've talked to about her see her as, if not quite "heroic,"
certainly as a kind of martyr--something I don't think helps anyone understand
or (more importantly) appreciate her often extraordinary writing. But these
people were young college kids (like me at the time), and more given to
uncritical romanticism than they might be today.

Anyway, I'm not sure that this is, as you say, a "gender" issue, and if I'm
going to buy that, I need something more substantial from your end than the
assertion that it's "obvious." If what you say is true, it's definitely worth
thinking about. Can you maybe elaborate on your earlier post?

Thanks, Katy.

Yours,

Gary Sullivan

David,

You have put me on the spot--

I don't really want to bring some of these people up for some personal
reasons--

But I will say that it seems quite obvious to me that depression, early
death (due to suicidal behaviors like smoking too much, drinking too much
etc), and unhealthy forms of poverty (not eating right) have been utterly
romanticized in the world of poetry--

I guess the funny thing is that I don't know whether some of the following
had children or not--in the great halls of liteary history it doesn't
matter when it's a man--

Jack Kerouac (I know he treated a number of women incl. wives poorly in
the name of his art), Celan, Milton (didn't die, but treated daughter like
crap in the name of his art...), Burroughs, Hemmingway, Faulkner and so
on. I think you know what I'm talking about--and I don't think what I'm
saying is very shocking or original--that men's literary needs--their
inspirational needs--are figured to be far more important than health or
family--health and family are looked upon as constraints...

One thing to
remember is that Ted Hughes was far more famous than Sylvia at
the time of her death--she did not know for sure that her work would go
down in history, so to speak, in the way it did--she was busy typing up
Ted's poems to send off to magazines--

Empedocles, pre-Socratic philosopher (a poet really, because that's sort of
the way those guys wrote, especially him, all reinforced by the fact that
his work only survives in fragments quoted by others), supposedly threw
himself into a volcano.

Otherwise (if we can even call the above, "heroic"), I can think of plenty
of male poet suicides, but the "heroic part" is entirely interpretive.

Butting in here--I'd include John Berryman and Hart Crane for starters. If =
we expand "killing oneself" to include reckless endangerment, Rimbaud is =
definitely an "heroic suicide" as would be Shelley. =

These suicides are romanticized in a way that women's suicides are not. =

Then there are those who are moved to kill themselves for a mixture of
political and personal motives. This is from today's NY Times - a review
of Fouad Ajami's _Dream Palace_:

"The overriding theme here is disillusionment. Ajami devotes an 84-page
chapter to Khalil Hawi, the influential Lebanese poet who committed
suicide in Beirut on the very day of the Israeli invasion of Lebanon,
June 6, 1982. Hawi, a man with whom Ajami clearly and strongly
identifies, embodied the failed effort of the Arabic man of letters to
create the ground for an Arab revival. "

I think Katy's right and wonder what people's take, if any, is on Margeux
(sorry--i'm a bad speller) Hemingway's death was.   I honestly don't recall
the coverage but wonder if her death was "blamed" on Papa?  Or was it treated
as a sort of greek-tragic "sins of the father" melodrama?  Is this "blame" in
the same way that Hughes's burning Plath's journal to "protect the children"?
It may well have seemed a good idea at the time to do so, but it does pretty
much make her out, in a very public way, to be a bad mom who wrote god knows
what that the kids shouldn't see.

Someone mentioned depression/manic depression and certainly it seems
reasonable to suggest that while Ted's infidelity might have been a catalyst,
larger problems were already there.  But here's something: Wasn't there
another woman involved with Hughes who committed suicide?  One wonders if Ted
was sort of attracted to women who were depressed and self-destructive.  The
whole excitingness of the writer's energy and work and the interest in
watching someone self-destruct.  Like watching National Geographic specials.

I just started reading Radsula's Wax Museum and liken some of the Hughes and
Plath.  The whole wax museum-- with royalty next to the hall of horrors --
reality that Radsula likens to the US poetry "scene" seems fitting in
thinking about the Hughes/Plath marriage and his new book of poems regarding
her. That whole appeal of seeing the height of "goodness" (Sylvia's finding
of her "true voice" in Ariel) and the depth of despair (the notebooks that
had to be destroyed they were so painful).  The _Birthday Poems_ seem to
celebrate and embody Plath with everything Radsula is talking about regarding
how Americans perceive poetry.   BTW, what are others thinking of Radsula's
book?

perhaps a sniff of the Lucrece about women's suicides, malodourously?

Mime-Version: 1.0

There's suicide (Plath, Sexton, Celan, Berryman) and "suicide" (Dylan
Thomas, Jack Spicer, Malcolm Lowry--drinking oneself to death ; or risky
behavior -- the version that Shelley, sailing into a storm, was crying out
"more sail!" etc etc) and it does have something heroic about it. It
appears to operate as an underlining of the poet's wholehearted dedication
to his/her art. As a choice of the poetic of life as against the conformist
demands of society. As if there is an authenticity to living out a fatal
drive that is absent from the heavily negotiated life many of us elect to
endure.

Of course, it's despicable, all that, "chickening out", breaking the hearts
of spouses and friends and children. (Dylan Thomas left behind of kids a
bunch. Who must be in their 40s by now. Anyone know how they are? They must
be mentioned in the widow Caitlin's _Leftover Life to Kill_ but I havent
read it.)

Mime-Version: 1.0

        I apologize for using two message-spaces where I could have done
this in one. . . I blame my slow "suicide" through martinis and painpills
for this morning-after forgetfulness. (But then, blame the pain, which is
the physical kind, one I keep trying to refuse, nothing of the "suffering
artist" sort, although I know that too. But to _that_, I'm "adjusted".
Don't understand poets who subscribe to religious dogma : dont want
anything but poetry between me and my psychic pain). . .

 But I should have added to my prior post on this topic, that in the heroic
there is always a refusal of some kind. With innovators, for example, who
refuse the recent conventions.There have been poets who, although their
verbal gifts would have stood them in good stead in society, refused
society, became recluses, devoted what life was theirs to their art. And
the greatest refusal is of life itself. This always leaves the hero
vulnerable (which is surely a meaning of Achilles' heel). The ground a hero
stands on is, wretched mix of metaphor, but psychical sound, his or her
blind spot. And suicides are vulnerable to the charge of utter selfishness.

Butting in also: Frank Stanford, b. 1949, did, in the words of T. Lux,
stop his own clock -- "with three lead thuds" -- in 1978; "irreversible
cliche."  (See _Sunday_).  He too was thirsty.

1967 Berryman came to Buffalo, after his reading, at the party at Fiedler's
house, he was loaded and seething, people were afraid to talk to him, i was
naive, just beginning to discover Spicer myself, i asked him if he felt
there was any resonances between his work and Spicer's, to him it was a
contest, he asked me what i thought of the work of a few of his graduate
students whose names undoubtedly have gone down in some history i haven't
read.
Plath was not of the Lowell generation, she was a student of his, she's a
contemporary of Rich
wasn't it Dorn: if you think you're part of the solution, you're the problem.
alcoholism is only a more drawn out form of suicide and we could dance all
night with that list.

Gary,

Of course, on some level, everything is a "gender issue" in any society--

Perhaps my use of the word "obvious" was meant to include not only Plath's
reputation and the ramifications of her biography on her reputation (as
well as on Hughes') but also a number of larger issue facing female
poets--

I am 25 right now--trying to think of ways to continue to write--it is no
news that women writers must face different challenges than male writers--

There are familial pressures, societal pressures etc.--and these relams of
a person's life often care little for "art" or the person in question as
an "artist"--

Historically, of course, allowances have been made for the "artistic
temperment" or "intellectual self-absorption" associated with writers--

But most of this discourse has been contructed around a male-identified
writer--

I think it is more than obvious that Plath's legacy and what we are to
make of it is made more complicated by the fact that she was a woman--a
mother and a wife.

In many intellectual traditions (I am thinking of Rabbinical ones most
specifically) women were forbidden to even learn to read and write--

This is not a legacy that disappears with even a few generations--

I find it strange that so many people on this list feel the need to deny
the effect of such a legacy--

In recent posts I have heard people deny that the taking of a man's last
name
by a woman has any connection to the oppression of women, that it is not
necessary to seek out women writers for publication if the editor is a man
and fraternizes with men, that Sylvia Plath is not seen differently
because
of her gender--

Could someone please explain to me how it has come to be that such denials
seem possible to make at this point in time?

Best regards,
Katy L.

well, you can tell i'm over the flu!...

i think "reception of suicide," if that's what we're talking about, is
gendered, yes... but to me and more important is the history of women's
lit. in general---to which i assume katy and others are making appeal,
finally---and of the various conflicts women writers have faced that men
have not faced... and of the (obvious, in my view) support structure that
tends to put women at men's disposal in this regard... i wish sandra braman
were here to talk about this, wrt douglas woolf (assuming sandra would want
to talk about it, and generalize thence)... whether this leads to suicide
or simply to depression and anxiety and and and is, to me, a finer
distinction (not that i don't value life as such)... i would have thought
that books like dale spender's _mothers of the novel_ would have made this
patently obvious...

ok, i'm using "obvious" too much!... but really---a careful look at the
history of the novel, say, in the 18th and 19th centuries, based on the
past twenty or so years of scholarship by (by & large) women, should
confirm these realities...

re rasula:  well i didn't really like kostelanetz's critique, though
evidently, as i say, he lands on research errors in rasula's substantial
appendices... but to spend the bulk of his little review picking on the
appendices and not on the gist of jed's argument is a mistake, methinks...
my review of jed's book, unabashedly positive, at

http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/postmodern_culture/v006/6.3r_amato.html

(you need access to project muse to get to pmc)

i feel like i'm advertising myself around here, apologies even as i hit SEND///

best,

Elizabeth,

*Jed's name is spelled Rasula: you've added a "d".

*But I'm glad you mentioned his book, American Poetry Wax Museum.
Actually, people keep discovering it and starting a new thread here on the
list about it...That's how I first heard of it, then after reading it a
talked it up here on a couple of different occasions.

*As I said then, it's exceptionally good at analyzing the lines of
interrelation and force in the whole culture of US poetry (of all types)
over most of this ending century..It gets much strength from being written
by a fine poet whose own work is not mainstream but who is interested in
the whole universe of possible poetries, even stuff that's very
conservative compared to him...

*For instance, after reading Wax Museum, it's interesting to see his piece
in a recent Chicago Review (dated Fall 1997), which I've just been
reading:  he reviews 10 books which he feels approach the idea of the
*book of poetry* as a coherent form.  His interests (and praise) stretch a
bit wide for me: Jorie Graham?? I continue to resist the idea (suggested
by many)  that she's moving into an interesting space away from the
conventional and mainstream; But anyway, Rasula's interests as a critic
and commentator on the poetry scene gain from his apparent urge to see the
best in any poet's work (or at least, to respond to whatever virtues they
have, of whatever type..)

*Generosity of spirit is always bracing..

Self-destructive egotistical antisocial behavior is not considered heroic
or poetic by the poets themselves in these cases.  The behavior is just
one of the perks.  - Henry Gould

in the interest of taking up only my 1/50th share in the days
discussings, I'd like to bring up some things here.

1. as someone who has known people who have instigated unmotivated
attacks on themselves often unto death--and however it is accomplished,
the effect is finally the same--let me say simply that the romance and
heroism of self-inflicted violence is purely a reader's fantasy here.

2. Several people responded to my call for work for my e-zine. I would
like to reiterate that call for work for STUDENT PERIODICAL CLUB. Any
kind of writing would be great, but I am going to put out a special call
for essayistic, journalistic-type, critical expository prose, with an
emphasis on culture and its manic inhabitants. The site is going to be
based on an image map I stole from the Smithsonian. This will happen
without you, but wouldn't it be better if you sent me something...

the front door is located at http://www.acsu.buffalo.edu/~kuszai/spc

3. I am preparing a poetics list survey. In order for it to be an
accurate measure of the list, I would hope that there would be a strong
reply to this survey when it goes out. In order to drum up some
enthusiasm for this private marketing analysis of poetics list
readership, I was thinking that there could be a sweepstakes. I will
donate a complete set of Meow Press catalog items and all the available
ephemera (approx 65 books) to the sweepstakes winner. Maybe we could
have multiple prizes. Anyone willing to pledge something for the jackpot
please contact me soon. [this survey is not being done under the
auspices of official list management or my position as list
manager-unlocker]

4. If there is anyone in San Diego area who would like to meet up or
tell me what events are happening, I will be there for two weeks in
early March. I'm happy to meet for coffee, etc., in the evenings when
the archive at UCSD is closed.

bye-bye

Well, Mayakovsky--if you want monuments and statues, schools and metro
stations named after you.  But he's not Stalin's creature nor is Plath
captive of those who'd crown her queen victim or, like Hughes, queen
other (those wild aboriginal lips!).  Have to say it's great to hear
Dodie Bellamy and Marjorie Perloff and Katy Lederer talking about her
poems _as poems_.  The mawkishness of the suicide cult had kept me at
arm's-length for decades (despite an early immersion).  Just last year
it seemed I could finally slough off some of the embarrassment and
acknowledge a musical debt.  Then, of course, Hughes comes along and
deposits his giant, uh, egg.

But suicide romance and poetic lineage--there's this from Ginsberg,
"Improvisation in Beijing" : "I write poetry because Russian poets
Mayakovsky and Yesenin committed suicide, somebody else has to
talk . . . "

        Let's face it, suicide is the ultimate closed-form. It is not new,
not innovative, not experimental, not revolutionary. It is stupid and
depressing, and kills writers. Don't anybody do it.

"alcoholism is only a more drawn out form of suicide and we could dance all
night with that list."

"In many intellectual traditions (I am thinking of Rabbinical ones most
specifically) women were forbidden to even learn to read and write--"

"the various conflicts women writers have faced that men
have not faced... and of the (obvious, in my view) support structure that
tends to put women at men's disposal in this regard"

If we generalize enough all distinctions get lost. Alcoholism is bad for
mind and body, and _sometimes_ it's an act of slow suicide, but so is life.
I mean, we're talking about different syndromes with different impacts on
one's surroundings.

I thought that in the shtetl women were forbidden to study with the men,
which meant in practice that they didn't learn biblical hebrew or talmudic
aramaic. Literacy in the other available languages was pretty common in
women, as they often conducted most of the business with the world beyond
family and village. My grandmother, whose father was a blacksmith, grew up
fluent in Yiddish, Russian and Polish, to which she added English when she
emigrated, all of which she read voraciously, and I know for a fact that
she wasn't unusual for her time and place. But I'm willing to be enlightened.

I've known several women writers whose husbands' work funded their literary
careers and afforded them lots of time for writng. I don't know too many
men who can say that.

Which is not to say that I don't realize that women's and men's lots are
different and that most women have different and perhaps more obstacles to
face. I merely mention these caveats in the interest of clarity, to which I
am addicted, and to make trouble, which is also fun sometimes.

As per your comment about Jorie Graham--

I think her work is interesting in that almost all of its
"avant-gardeness" in the eyes of the mainstream emanates from its manner
of punctuation and form--

In general at Iowa form is the dominating signifyer of "experimentalism"
or "avant-gardeness"--

That's why Plath is such an interesting case--

Her work, in my view, is incredibly "experimental" and "avant-garde"
because her tone and general content were so emotionally innovative--

Graham is very old-school in terms of her content (as apart from her form
in this example) as she is most influenced by the philosophical and
aesthetic trajectories associated with W Stevens and various
philosophers (from Plato to Nietzsche)--

The content of her work seems focused on temporal modulations of
emotion, the textures of things as they are imbued with emotional
intensities, intellectual hestiation and revision and so on...

Her formal characteristic might superficially resemble those of Scalapino,
the recent Guest--even Alice Notley--but her intellectual
interests do not coincide with these writers to any significant degree--

Plath, on the other hand, uses superficially "traditional forms," but
within them we find a range of poetic innovations--

Best,
Katy L.

btw, I've been thinking abt. the intersection of meanings in the
word "material" (artistic, Marxian, "of import") as a node for
poetry over the last decade; comparable maybe to the word
"moment" in Williams (time, import) or =96 what other examples?
Olson's "field" maybe, etc.

To what degree to folks here find their work (in the um "larger"

oh, "vocabulary": one always thinks Spicer with that word =96 surely
he's worth mentioning in the context of posthumously romanticized

Mark,

By "mainstream" do you mean "like everybody else"? In that case, Graham =
has never been "mainstream." If by "mainstream" you mean "popular," then I =
think she's actually moving into the "mainstream," not because she is =
stylistically or formally easy, but perhaps precisely because she is not. =
However, if you mean "mainstream" as a shorthand for "Iowa Writers' =
Workshop," just as a generation used "Iowa Writers' Workshop" as shorthand =
for a particular type of poem, I would argue that, IF indeed the workshop =
is the mainstream, then Graham has done much to make that stream a more =
interesting place to splash around in. While I was in Iowa, Graham brought =
an aesthetically diverse group of instructors to the program--Brenda =
Hillman, Killarney Clary, Heather McHugh, Bob Perelman, Robert Hass, Tom =
Sleigh. Moreover, the work that workshop students were producing is some of=
 the finest poetry being published today, from Jeff Clark's recent book =
from Sun and Moon, to Reginald Sheppard's wonderful "Some Are Drowning," =
to Jessica Lowenthal's soon to be released chapbook from Burning Deck. =

When I applied to Iowa, David Bromige cautioned me that the program might =
pressure me to conform to a (I suppose "mainstream") aesthetic. But then, =
I read Graham's "The End of Beauty" and I realized that she was balancing =
some oppositional poetics in remarkable ways. Lyn Hejinian (who will be =
teaching at Iowa this fall) said that Graham had been "oddly supportive" =
of her work. And Cydney Chadwick reminded me that Graham had chosen a Nate =
Mackey poem, first published in Avec, for inclusion in The Best American =
Poetry. And so, I did go to Iowa, and my aesthetic was not pressured, it =
was in fact supported and nurtured by Graham and by the odd assemblage of =
faculty that came through there during those two years.

I think this list does a lot of "Jorie Bashing," holding Graham up as =
symbolic -- what?  The Mainstream? I don't think so. Read her most recent =
book, The Errancy. Then go read something that's truly from the "=
mainstream" (which, nowadays by the by, case anyone hasn't noticed, either =
looks a hell of lot like Ashbery or a hell of a lot like Sharon Olds). =
With all due respect, Mark, hopefully, you will discern the difference.

I'm reminded of Peter Inman's work, some of which
can be thought of exactly as a series of stops, but
structured by a unit much smaller than the line. See
for instance Vel (a wonderful book), where. at. times.
each. word. or at. most. a small. group. is. a. full. stop.
the effect is better there than I'll bother to attempt here,
because of the variety of utterances =96 i.e., sometimes,
as above, you'll find a "normal" sentence or utterance
thus divided, but it might be in a sea of single- and
multiple-word fragments =96 or perhaps a better way
of saying that is that P. Inman is Steinian not only
in his attn. to language, but in that his work is more or
less continuous with the world, departing from and
returning to things and utterances as it finds them fit.

The period (mark and unit) punctuates the work more in
the sense of "puncture" than score (or in the sense of
"score" as notch, mark showing starting place, etc.); as a
reader, one is asked relentlessly to re-begin, negotiating a
full-stop usually reserved for line-breaks and ends of phrase,
so much so that I would risk saying period is everything to
the work, it's deliberate focus. The attention it requires is
incredible =96 tension that comes from reading every single
word ad literam. But happily one continues, because pulling
across those periods is a text that moves between a richly
"material" language and the things of the world (speech and
its objects).

Anyone else familiar with this book? it's a favorite of mine.

Chris

no, best not slaughter oneself given the 'unrevolutionary',
middle-of-the-road 'non-experimental' nature of doing so.  Suicide isn't a

Allow.me.to.try.again.  What I'm trying to approach with my notion of "stops"
is that which I think is most fundamental to any art--to make one look, but
look again; to touch, but touch again; to perceive, but perceive again; to
think, but think again, etc.  (I'm as interested in intervening in  my own
habitual processes as I am in the processes  of any potential auditor of my
work.)And you are right, the size of the textual unit will vary.  Inman is an
excellent example. I'm of course interested in the materiality of language but
I'm even more interested in an interesting response.Resist habits:  there can
be official unofficial verse culture too. To sort of pata-phrase
Nietzsche--"Every name in history is Elvis."
Best wishes,

Tom Beckett

Those with an interest in stops might want to look at "image"
on the wr-eye-tings scratchpad.  I was trying to explore "stop"
in the sense of not being able to get out of a maze and the
action or motion of a reader's eye (?attention?) as it moves
to the edge of a page and onto the next one.  Don't know
if I succeedded.

To Bob:

"Attaching "Image" for scratchpad--3 pages, 1 gif.  Hope
this doesn't get too confusing.  Or too frustrating -
one of the things I am curious about here is how this
'maze' affects viewers frustration tolerance.  It may
also be that in other browsers it doesn't work."

Douglas,

If, as you say,

"I'm not a great fan of his [T Hughes'] writing but as a teacher I have had to
include it in courses on post 1945 poetry...,"

you are guilty of malpractice.

Teach what you believe in, or don't bother. There's too much good poetry out
there to ever be covered in one college career, let alone one course. To waste
it on "official verse culture" is to simply contribute to the a-literacy and
poetry-phobia that innundates us all.

Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII
Content-transfer-encoding: 7bit

As I'm headed into the last two days before deadline to punch out a thesis on
Jorie Graham, I stall some more and read my email...and find that the same
quandary paralyzing my work is now played out in the conversation between Mark
Prejsnar and Katy Lederer.

Jorie...let's see...where does she "fit"...is she carrying out the Romantic
project, the Modernist project?  Is she a neo-romantic-symbolist with
postmodern convulsions?  Yes, I would agree that she travels along the
"Wallace Stevens" trajectory to a large degree, and it's certainly true that
she struggles in the ontological oscillation that occurs between Plato's
Ideals and the search for a Unified Field Theory (or Theory of Everything).
Along with those metaphysical oscillations, her work lunges almost
schizophrenically between the polarities many would call "mainstream"  and
"experimental."

It's very frustrating for me to deal with this thesis, because I'd started out
thinking that I'd chosen a writer who's aesthetics couldn't be said to
"foreground" language as a primary project, but who was finding (particularly
in "Errancy") a "new way of looking," who was groping for a new language to
create self/culture (a la Richard Rorty).  Plus, I was attracted to her
flirtations with the dialectic between classical platonic idealism and
postmodern contingency and irony.

Reading Jorie Graham, to be very honest, has required a crash course in
philosophy and physics---having failed to enjoy a "mainstream" liberal arts
education, I really didn't know Plato's "cave" story; I had no idea what
Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle was; I'd heard the name Bergson but knew
nothing of his metaphysics; and Voltaire?  Montescieu?  Mark Rothko?
Nietzsche?  St. Thomas Aquinas?  These were all names I'd heard, as if
grasping the label were enough to "know," almost osmotically, what was being
referred to, but truly---I had no clue as to what might have been the
difference between Nietzsche's "will to power" and Bergson's "flux" and "elan
vital" ideas.  I couldn't distinguish between the idealism of Plato and the
idealism now being generated in response to perspectives derived from "new
physics" and quantum mechanics.

In that sense, my experience of Jorie Graham's work has been drastically
altered.  I've spent the bulk of my reading/research on delving into her
allusions and into the disciplines that inform her work, rather than on
considerations of her prosodic strategies, linguistic aesthetics, and "place"
in the "field" of poetry.  I've been dismayed to discover that what "looked"
as though it were reasonably avant-garde form on the page has revealed itself
to be "postmodern" or "language"-oriented only in the sense that her "self" is
somewhat diffuse; her syntax can get pretty elliptical and paratactic; her
structures lean on cinematic techniques, montage and collage, and Conte's
"serial" form (sometimes).   But these are all techniques and responses that
have been done and done and done during the entire twentieth-century,
particularly by the Modernists.  So...how could I possibly make a case that
she was using some of the same strategies as, say, Lyn Hejinian or Kathleen
Fraser?  Not only was my thesis shot, but I was now drowning in the same
polluted waters that everyone else was in their attempts to articulate
language poetry, postmodern poetry, avant-garde poetry, or experimental
poetry.

I finally decided that Graham was postmodernist in the sense that
postmodernism is highly involved in comprehensively reviewing the entire
Western Canon, especially in relationship to other canons and non-canonical
writing, and that she was engaged in a huge re-evaluation project.  If Graham
was guilty of any "subversion," though, it was a sneaky kind of subversion,
one that crept up on me, that crawled over me at night as I lay sweating,
trying to figure out if she was a classical dualistic thinker struggling to
embrace a more taoistic view of the universe, or a taoistic/ironic thinker who
was longing for classical dualism.  Was she trying to gear up for some kind of
"quantum leap" into faith in an Ideal reality behind material phenomenon?  Was
she trying to engage in her own form of Pascal's "wager," seeking some
certainty in these indeterminate waters of our current culture?  Or was she
mutating a quasi-platonism into an odd form of contingency-based,
antimetaphysical faith?

I still don't know.  Maybe, now that I have only 48 hours to actually write
the paper (after all the reading and research I've done), I may "find" the
answer in the process of writing...

And maybe not.  I may have framed my questions too narrowly.  I may be
suffering from a highly-deficient lack of context.  But somehow, I suspect
that Jorie Graham is, in fact, an avant-garde writer of an unrecognizable
style, and I damned well mean to find out a way to demonstrate it, if my hunch
is born out over the next two days.

Wish me luck.  If anyone has any opinions on the matter, and would like to
throw some spice into the pot, I would be much obliged for the confusion.

I appreciate David Bromige's distinction between risktaking and "heroic
suicide," and some others have noted the anti-social behavior aspect of
poetic heroism.  My question is, what about Osip Mandelstam? Wasn't his
"anti-social behavior" (comparing Stalin's mustache to a cockroach, etc,
in a poem) or, should we call it risk-taking?, also suicidal?

Joseph Brodsky, in his essay on Mandelstam, argues that Mandelstam's
character as a poet would have led to his "doom" anywhere, not just in
Stalin's Russia.  Brodsky isn't criticising Mandelstam when he says this,
he is making the point that Mandelstam was not fundamentally political,
he was just a poet.

Mandelstam did try to reform his behavior, by the way, attempting to
write a panegyric to Stalin, but it couldn't compensate for the cockroach
metaphor.

Meanwhile, Osip left behind Nadzhevda (I'm sure I misspell, from memory),
who doesn't seem to resent Osip for leaving her behind, but rather those
persons and forces that put him in his position in the first place.

to marjorie perloff,

        i, who have read many works by plath, and the work in the paper by ted
hughes, have to agree with you on every note.  i think that ted hughes and
his repetitive approach to excuses for plath's death has became an
intoxicating journey.  he has tried to measure up to the dismal beauty of
Sylvia Plath, and he has not succeeded.  It must make him feel horrible to
be accused of being a murderer, which is what he is (only in the sense of
killing her work), so that he felt he must justify himself.  which is fine,
but in such a vapid approach, it becomes a obvious mere reconciliation.  i
have heard so many reviews, front page articles, but nothing that he can
say, or write, nobody that he can scapegoat, will take away from the
selfish deed he did when he took the right to destroy some of Plath's last
work, for his own self indulgence.

I think, by the way, that the difference between a platonic idealism, say, and
a buddhistic or quantum idealism, may be in this distinction:

Platonic "archetypes," like quantum "waves," represent an ideal
potentiality--but in classical Greek idealism, the archetypes are somewhere
"out there," in a transcendent, metaphysical realm.  In what I'll call
"quantum idealism," the archetypes, the "waves" that "exist" in "potentia" are
not "out there," but in consciousness.  Consciousness is the ground of being;
it isn't the waves, nor the archetypes, that are "real," that unify our
universe, but consciousness of both immanent phenomenon and transcendent
possibility/contingency.  Consciousness is the unifying field, or matrix,
holding imminent/transcendent dualities as one reality.

In other words, it is neither the wave nor the particle, neither the
archetypes nor the illusions on the cave wall, that are "real."  These domains
exists inside consciousness; nothing is outside consciousness.  It is
consciousness that "collapses the wave function" and results in perception of
a particle.

So, the duality of Plato's thinking has been replaced by something else...that
may someday turn out to be just as dualistic!  I mean...could this "unified
field theory of consciousness" eventually be seen as establishing yet another
polarity...Consciousness vs. Everything Else?   Or, Post Big-Bang
Consciousness vs. Contemperaneous Big Bang Symmetry?

Help!!!!  How the hell am I going to say anything about Jorie Graham's poetry
when she's got me swimming around in the questions she's brought up?  What
poetry?  I guess, in that sense, with my focus on her content, on that which
her language refers to, that her poetry can be seen as transparent, rather
than opaque.  If experimental poetry is equated with opacity of language, then
she's not cutting the mustard.  On the other hand...what is she talking about?
Her "position," so oddly uncertain, improbable, and contingent, could hardly
be more opaque!!!!  And there is the rub...Is she a wave? Is she a particle?
Can I assume the role that "consciousness" might normally take and find some
synthesis here?  Hmmmm....

The Guardian Angel of the Swarm
Jorie Graham

inclension of          (endogenous)

crannies of          (exogenous)

labyrinth                    swarm

teeming    unearthed    invagination    osciallation

collision           suppression

intubation          prefiguration

matter is marbled, of two different styles.

                              **

It is the upper floor it has no windows.
It is a dark room decorated only
by a stretched canvas, diversified by folds,
as if it were a living dermis.  Placed there, on the opaque canvas,
folds, cords, springs represent
an innate form of what we call knowledge.
But when solicited by matter
they move into action, trigger

vibrations, oscillations--a correspondence, even a communication--
between the two labyrinths,
between the pleats of matter and the pleats of soul--

(matter is marbled, of two different styles)---

But the universe appears compressed by an active force
that endows matter with a curvilinear or spinning movement,
following an arc that ultimately has no tangent.
And the infinite division of matter causes compressive force
to return all portions of matter to the surrounding areas,

to the neighboring parts that bathe and penetrate the given body---

Dividing endlessly, the parts of matter form
little vortices in a maelstrom, and in these
are found even more vortices, even smaller,
and even more are spinning in the concave
intervals of the whirls that touch one another---

an infinitely porous, spongy or cavernous texture without emptiness---

                           **

unfolding is thus not the contrary of folding,
but follows the fold up to the following fold---
particles turned into folds that contrary
effort changes over and again---

                         **

and every fold originates from a fold, plica
ex plica...---an entre-deux, something
"between" in the sense that a difference is being
differentiated--

                       **

and it is thus the world must be placed in the subject---
in order that the subject be FOR the world---

this is the torsion that constitutes the fold---
thus the soul is what has folds AND is full of folds---

in order that the virtual be incarnate---

(thus the soul is what has folds and is full of folds)---

(the fold moves from inflection to inclusion)---

(infinite seriality may be the soul)---
(curvatures may be in it---)

why would something be folded, if it were
not to be enveloped, wrapped, or put into
something else?---

does what is folded exist only
in something that envelops it?---

is it not exactly point-of-view that includes?---

and when inclusion is accomplished, is it not done
                                               so continuously
it includes the sense of a finished act that is not the site,
not the place, not the point-of-view,

but what remains in point-of-view,

what  OCCUPIES point-of-view---

necessarily a soul, a subject---

a power of envelopment AND development,

folding when enveloped, unfolding when developed---

an implication, an explication, a complication---

a sort of city---

the course of a given street and that of another---

an infinite series of curvatures, of inflections---

the entire world enclosed in the soul by point-of-view---

Is something else needed?

Is a realization in matter also required?

We cannot be sure.

The soul has no windows by which anything
could come in or go out.  It has no opening.  It has no doorway.

Everything is drawn out of it, nothing comes in.

It is a cell.  It resembles a sacristy more than an atom.

All activity takes place on the inside.

An inside without an outside.

We decorate the inner walls.

As its correlative, think of the independence of the facade.

The facade is riddled with holes, although there is no void

(a hole being only the site of a more rarefied matter)---

                     **

Come now, let us go.

The problem stems from too short a present tense.  It's just before spring
now and it looks like an old season without a name, squeezing in between
younger more well-known seasons, trying to imitate a young fall.  Small
modest birds investigate twigs on vestiges of old snow.  Automobiles agree
with this weather.  They fit into the mold - metal fungi.  Somewhere out there
a crazy old man is rolling cans of baked beans all the way down the block.

I think we're on the same page.  My reaction is well yeah, most poets that
I've met who attained any reputation were drunks, druggies and more than a few
severely depressed.  But isn't it enough that they do the work?  Do they also
have to be model citizens, correct in every way?  Life for many people is
nearly unbearable, and when ambitions are achieved and what's discovered is
the same emptiness they were so desperately trying to escape from, it's small
wonder they're bitter.  Of course this doesn't include everyone, but it
includes enough of them that one can fairly view it as one of the risks of the
profession, which is hard enough without having to live up to whatever
bourgeoise standards are in vogue.  I'm trying to stay out of this one, but I
agreed with the sensibility of your post and wanted to tell you that.

as I understand it this message about Mandelstam supports what I was saying
earlier about the Plath/Hughes syndrome as an example of an unconscious
scapegoating-martyrdom event in which a whole culture partakes.  Mandelstam
baited Stalin in the same way Plath baited Hughes (& Hughes took the bait).

whoa! mark weiss writes, among other thihngs"

I've known several women writers whose husbands' work funded their literary
careers and afforded them lots of time for writng. I don't know too many
men who can say that.

to which i reply:


i know lots of cases in which women worked to put their husbands thru law
school, medical school, business school, etc, only to be dumped when hubby
finished, got a job, and met some sexier, funner chick in med school law
school, etc or on the job.

i'm with katie on this, but i've long since learned that POETIX isn't

   I walked to school on the first day of Spring.  I felt the earth rotating.
A dog barked pleasantly.  I saw puddles in the ground.
   In a meadow turning green, I think it was part of a golf course, I saw
eight or nine young girls laughing and dancing around.  They were carrying a
young sapling which was decorated with green, red and white ribbons and had
a crown of pine branches on top.  They carried the tree down a slope to the
edge of a pond from which the ice had just melted.  Then one of them took
from a bag what looked like a burnt piece of wood and a paper Halloween
skeleton.  With great solemnity they tossed the wood and the skeleton into
the pond and shook the young sapling over them. Then, giggling, they danced
back over the hill and out of sight.

As I said, I was trying to make trouble. But to be serious for a moment, as
I also said, I'm under no illusion that the gender playing field is level.
Life is usually not very fair, and is clearly less fair to women than to
men. Just pointing out that broad generalizations do little justice to the
more nuanced actuality. To quote the opening to the very brief message to
which you are reacting, "If we generalize enough all distinctions get lost."
Hopefully your eyes don't roll whenever someone in basic agreement suggests
a mild modification.

Anent Tom Beckett's "stops"

am reminded of the contra project

of w s merwin removing all his punctuation

(like he said pulling out the nails [or tacks?] that were

holding the poem down to the page allowing it

to lift off)  a thing he started doing in the

70s or thereabouts & then

never stopped

he allowed that reading such unpunctuate po

"slowed" somewhat the reading

usefully

(syntax rendered
in his particular use of that
some modest puzzle to parse betimes)

d.i.

p.s.:

last night Christopher Walken [sp?] in Bravo's "The Actor's Studio"
interview

allows a thing he does w/ a approach to a script is to cross out all affect
stage direction & likewise all the punctuation

(e.g., write out one's lines sans suchlike)
so one can read the text & figure it through oneself

he also claimed he speaks w/o any punctuation
the assertion proved incredible from the evidence

         The following passage from Rasula's _Wax Museum_ does a great deal to
explain his strategy in the book and in his on-going assault on a poetry
establishment that persistently rewards safe mediocrity with canonization,
academic jobs, literary prizes, and commercial publishing.  In dealing with
the anthologies of Weinberger, Messerli, and Hoover, whose tastes Rasula
undoubtedly shares, he writes:

    "The messianic temptation of oppositionality has proven too tempting,
apparently.  But we should be motivated to wonder about  this latest pride in
heresy. If countermeasures are intended, what purpose is served by making an
orthodoxy of the unorthodox?  ...The fallacy of revolutionary thinking in the
literary milieu, suggests Wolfgang Iser, is the temptation 'to believe that by
negating something, you have already grasped its otherness...  With pure
negation, the revolution remains dependent upon that which it negates, and the
more radical the destruction, the more inevitably it must lead to
self-destruction.'  The spectre of autonomous opposition summoned by these
anthologies ends up serving the reactionary forces they oppose....

    "It seems to me the truly seditious anthologist now should go poaching,
retain the geneaological profile as a courtesty, but not rely on it for the
crutch of indignation or heoric price.  When the world of Associated Writing
Programs has to contend to with an anthology that puts Jorie Graham and C.K
WIlliams next to a swarm of language poets, then and only then will it be
forced to confront its own ideological dispensation beginning to erode as if
from within."

    Rasula's practice is consistently seditious in this sense.  In fact, he
has  made the American Poetry Wax Museum so attractive (and so effective is
his sedition) that Richard Kostelanetz throws a litte fit (in the recent
_Poetics Briefs_) that he is not included.  RK should perhaps be installed
there on the list along with John Koethe, Ted Kooser, Greg Kuzma in some out
of the way gallery, as real as life and as susceptible to melt-down from the
heat of any real attention. (Incidentally, KR is simply wrong in his claim
that Rasula failed to tabulate Paul Carroll's _The Young American Poets_ (see
p. 488), and one of the other anthologies that he mentions does not appear in
the OCLC combined catalog, so it obviously escaped the attention of the Wax
Museum).

--the text of Jorie Grahm's sems to need to be read against "A Thousand
Plateaus" (Deleuze and Guattari).  ... and that reading for me melds
with two other threads. Psychoanalysis and poetry "rhizoming" into
schizzoanalysis.

On suicide and depression, etc? This is simplistic: depression can drive
one to seek an edge-experience. Some think of Plath's suicide as a
muffed attempt to return again from the edge--well that is debatable ...

... alcoholism ... that is killing yourself slowly ... there is writing
in the face of wanting to die (even if that whish is in denial) ... and
all of this as I imagine it is "depressingly" normal in those stratas of
society that produces self-identified poets. I have read William's
"Desert Music" this way.

... still, the willful pursuit of an edge experience. I find it
impossible to deny that this has value for poetry: Artaud, Rimbaud ...
even engineers of formalism are often sadistic.

I was looking at two of her poems "Whiteness I Remember" (an early horse
poem which takes a very conventional, autobiographical approach) versus
"Ariel" (back to the horse agin, but with wildly experimental language, a
much more spare use of form, much more tension, and much more
emotional depth and immediacy).

Quite a leap, in my opinion. Looking at the earlier work, you would never
think it possible. Graham in my opinion doesn't change much emotionally--
she does, however, have a brilliant mind and I like the thought in her
poems.

My name is Randy Prunty and I joined this List in January.  My Atlanta poetry
comrade, Mark Prejsnar, got the List off on this Graham thread, which he
probably knows I can't resist.
Up until one year ago, I had never had an interest in poetry of any kind.  I
stumbled across some work by Jorie Graham and I was HOOKED!   For about six
months I read and reread everything I could get my hands on by her.  At the
same time, I was looking around to find other poets that had the same energy,
tension, intellectual questing that Graham has - for me.  I had no luck
(anybody wanta buy a bunch of "mainstream" books and journals?) until I found
the world of experimental, non-mainstream, poetry.  Now, I'm really hooked on
poets like Coolidge, Bernstein (the elder, though I'd like to see some work by
Berstein age 12 1/2), and all these crazy  poetry mags I find on Selby's list.
So would you say that, for me, Jorie Graham was an intro to the avant-garde?
A bridge?
By the way, I only occasionally go back and read her works.  And it seems odd
to me that I find her "middle" books - End of Beauty, Region of Unlikeness,
and Materialism-  more interesting than her recent Errancy.  That is, Errancy
at least looks more experimental.
And a note to Aviva.  Except for the pressure of your deadline, it sounds like
you are in a great place!  I'm guessing that the process you are going through
will turn out to be more "important" to you than the product of your thesis.
I would love to hear how all this turns out for you.

mark: there was no indication in the post that you were in basic agreement.
phrases like "life is usually not very fair" are patronizing. assertions
such as "I've known several women writers whose husbands' work funded their
literary

this is one of the points (in a different, and, i think, more useful
because more wide-ranging context) i appreciated about watten's ILS essay
--its interrogation of "oppositionality" as a sufficient rationale for
certain (claims about) "innovative" poetries, esp those that estrange the
quotidien relationship of "meaning" to utterance.

on suicide: i read a very compelling and helpful argument that people are
driven to suicide when their pain exceeds the resources they have for
coping; i found this little rule of thumb helpful for demystifying the cult
or the fear or the stigmatizing of suicides or depressives who have been
drawn to suicide.  that was in a book called "out of the nightmare" --can't
remember the author.  he also, as others have on the list, makes the
important point that often suicides or attempted suicides occur in families
either where there has been a suicide, or the early death of a parent.

joe b, "project muse" is what johns hopkins calls their consortium of
online journals (speaking loosely, but i think this is a good way to
describe same)... it costs something like (i think) $50 a year to subscribe
to their offerings (i don't know if that's institutional or
individual---fortunately, even my relatively impoverished institution
subs)... this was a controversial move on the part of _postmodern culture_,
as detailed by joel felix (in detail) in the latest issue of the
_electronic book review_ (ebr), which IS free... you can get to ebr6 at

http://www.altx.com/ebr/ebr6/ebr6.htm

for a full discussion by joel of the ins & outs of this controversy (and
it's an asskicking issue all the way 'round---part 1 of 'image &
narrative'---i'd encourage any and all around here to spend some time with
it)... it's fair to say that many hands were (publicly & privately) wrung
over this decision...

apologies if i've botched any of the details here... best to turn it over
to joel f's piece...

best,

Randy, thanks for your encouragement.  I'm not having much forward momentum
with this thing, and I really must be done by tomorrow night.  Here's the
results thus far (oh pitiable chunk):

IS THERE A NEW WAY OF LOOKING?: (ON) (WITH) THE POETRY OF JORIE GRAHAM

Aviva Vogel

I stood gawking in the January snow with my four-year-old daughter.  We’d just
emerged from a dark house into pure sunshine.  Excess energy bounced off the
clean snow, the rusting jeep, silvered barn boards, sky deepening to cobalt,
stands of black pine.   I was dumbstruck by the ridiculous exuberance of this
sassy January sun.  Off to my right, about eight or nine chickens were puck-
pucking and snatching at seed thrown in the snow.  Across the road, pines drew
light in.

Everything seemed to oscillate at incredibly high speeds, while I was
dumbstruck.  The chickens seemed to be crying out" yes, no! yes, no! yes, no!"
at the speed of light, switching "on" and "off" in unfathomably rapid binary
pulsations.  I knew instantly that everything was swelling from and receding
into an unbounded, infinite, invisible matrix.  Even the snow, an old tire
rim, my little girl in her periwinkle snowsuit, red clapboards on the house, a
pony’s swishing tail—all were calling out "I’m here! I’m not here! I’m here!
I’m not here!"  It was clear that I was just another "thing" vibrating in the
snow and sunshine, an intermittent condensation or coagulation in the
"atmosphere" of the matrix.  I knew that nothing was "there"—that everything
was "there"—that I was pulsing in and out of the matrix, too—all of us
existing and not existing at tempos faster than I cared to imagine.  I was
caught up in a great, taunting game of warp-speed hide-and-seek.

Now it is 1998, twenty years later.  I have never forgotten that incident, nor
have I ever repeated it.  Yet, somehow, when I read certain poems, I feel
myself drawing (or drawn) near that moment/place again.  I’m quite sure that
Jorie Graham’s poetry lures me because it seems to promise a possible reentry
into that mysterious and clear domain of what I call the "on and off" of
things.  Graham seems compulsively preoccupied with this odd juxtaposition of
the explicit and the implicit in the universe, with unconcealing some kind of
schematic for the play of "what’s here," along with its necessary
complements—what’s "potential"—and "what’s not here".
Graham’s persistent meditation on the subject, from the first volume Hybrids
of Plants and Ghosts, to her most recent, The Errancy, has undergone
permutations in prosodic strategies and emotional resilience, although she is
unwaveringly engaged in "quarrying the emptiness for furling laws."  (E13)

In "Notes on the Reality of the Self," (Materialism), the poem’s speaker
states, "Nothing is virtual."  A little further on, she asks, "Is this body
the one I know as me?"  The slipping away of a recognizable, stable self is
contrasted with the seeming reality of the "roiling" river that she is staring
at.  There it is, quite aggressively and vividly in front of the poem’s "I", a
river writhing with spring thaw, a river whose "long brown throat…is sucking
up from some faraway melt…"  And yet, the river is only "Expression pouring
forth, all content no meaning."  What kind of void (of purpose) is the speaker
sensing?  What insubstantiality, in spite of earlier claims that "Nothing is
virtual", seeps into her mind, and what perspective on such oppositions will
this poem take?  Smelling "rot gasses" rising out of "dank leaves" on the
riverbank, she says:

…I put my
breath back out
onto the scented immaterial.  How the invisible

"Is there a new way of looking—"?  This is a central question for Jorie
Graham, as it is for me, and I find myself embroiled in strange and familiar
waters while reading her poetry over these last few weeks.  Disturbed,
uncertain, flipping and spinning, I identify with the "filaments where leaf-
matter accrued round a/ pattern, a law, slipping off, precariously, bit by
bit,/ and flicks, and swiftnesses suddenly more water than not."  I find my
own moments of "rightness snapping loose," as if I’d been swept up in some
manic spring flood created by the great freezing and thawing, the coherence
and disintegration, the amassing and loosening, of Jorie’s restless mind.

Katy, I'm hoping to find more evidence of something entirely original in
Graham's work than a shell of adopted formalities, but...I certainly see your
point so far.  I have my concerns, too, as much as I'm enamored of her themes
and luscious language.

<< I think her work is interesting in that almost all of its "avant-gardeness"
in the
eyes of the mainstream emanates from its manner of punctuation and form--
In general at Iowa form is the dominating signifyer of "experimentalism"
or "avant-gardeness"-- >>

And I believe that she takes the trajectory into new domains, influenced by
quantum mechanics/physics's Uncertainty Principle, Unified Field Theory
efforts, etc.  Most importantly, I think that she has absolutely rejected this
idea of a progressive (linear) "trajectory".  As she puts it in
her title poem, "The Errancy":

...the populace...just very tired on its long red errancy/ down the freeways
in the dusklight/ towards the little town on the hill -- the 'crystal-
formation'? --/ how long ago was it we said that? do you remember?...and the
distance we've/ traveled -- ...and how little we've found -- aren't we tired?/
aren't we going to close the elaborate folder/ which holds the papers in their
cocoon of possibility...perpetual bloom...dread fatigue...

I'm not sure Graham is holding out for any global and/or contingent "supreme
fiction," although she's obsesses with this holy grail quest...


<<Graham is very old-school in terms of her content (as apart from her form
in this example) as she is most influenced by the philosophical and
aesthetic trajectories associated with W Stevens and various
philosophers (from Plato to Nietzsche)-->>

More later...company just burst in...dogs, loud voices, mass confusion, god
how will i get this thesis done???

It seems to me that you are seconding some of the things Doug Powell
said--that even if one doesn't "like" Graham's work, one has to admit
that in the world of poetic politics--and what gets taught--she has done a
lot to "bridge" the "gap" between "camps"--

This kind of bridging, of course, brings up some provocative questions--

I know Stein said something along the lines of "once you're assimilated
into the wider culture ["popularized" so to speak] you are useless" (does
anyone have the reference here? I would love to hear it...).

Being a student of Graham's I have had to think about this kind of thing a
lot--

Stein, as someone pointed out recently here, was just a category on
Jeopardy--where does this leave her?

How much and in what ways do "experimental" or "fringe" writers want to
be
accepted into the larger culture of poetry? The larger culture of America?

What kinds of "subversions" can remain subversive once "popularized" etc.

I think this really has to do with the individual poet--

Notley's Descent, for example, is not necessarily politically subversive
(in the sense that it is about tyranny etc., it is ethical in a familiar
way)--the aesthetics of it are also "strange" but, as Notley says in a
note at the beginning of the book, the punctuation and form are meant to
remind the reader that this is a spoken text--a medium to be "listened"
to, not just read, again a perfectly "normal" impulse on Notley's part--

Scalapino's ontological explorations are of a different nature--perhaps
the "findings" of her work are a little bit more difficult to
swallow--perhaps the "experimental" nature of this work would suffer from
popularity--perhaps.

And so on--

I notice that more and more (particularly female) writers from such
"mainstream" environments as Iowa are writing "strangely" and, in some
sense because of their pedigrees, are publishing their "strange" poems in
mainstream journals (I am thinking here of Hillman and Claudia Keelan)--

For me the Graham issue--even the Stein issue--speaks more to pedigree and
its effects on critical and cultural reception--not so much to the work
itself--

Best,
Katy

Depression. Suicide.  I've been following the conversation for the last few
days and was trying to stay out of it but I can't.  Here goes...I can put a
face on this--my own.  Depression is a fact of my life that I am trying to
deal with.  It is difficult to communicate how stifling, how oppressive, how
overwhelming and crippling it can be if you've not experienced it.  I goes
well beyond "having a bad day" and involves patterns of obsessive thinking
that one has to learn how to shut off if one is to survive.  There are no easy
fixes.  A pill might help but it can ultimately only be part of the answer.

When I was a small child, I suffered a head trauma that caused epilepsy and
that took away many aspects of my physical coordination.  Before the trauma I
could turn somersaults, afterwards not.  Before I had normal fine motor
skills, afterwards not,etc.  The !950s were not great years in which to be
epileptic, different, hyperactive, uncoordinated, unusually tall, and
emotionally uncertain. I was beaten up regularly.  Add in an authoritarian
father who  found me disappointing.  It, I, was a problem.  I was shunted to
doctors, psychs, medicated (for 16 years), hooked to machines, sent to a
"special school" (grades 3 to 5) that taught me nothing but that I was
abnormal.  Resources for kids with these kinds of problems are better now but
in the 50s and early 60s it was a nightmare.  I learned to be fearful.  I
learned to feel incompetent.  I've always felt that I don't belong anywhere.
It has made for difficulties (that damn word again).

More recently I've had years of pain from a back injury which is now better
and last spring I was physically assaulted while doing an housing inspection
at a low income housing project.

All of this is shorthand for things that could be gone on about at booklength.
I'll resist the impulse.  What I'm trying to suggest (beyond whining) is that
there are many layers to a person's depression.  It occurs in context(s).  I,
for one, need better coping skills.  I'm trying to get them.

Suicide is an unfortunate outcome.  But I understand all too well how it can
happen. We don't all have the same pain thresholds--or the same learning
opportunities.  I wish Walter Benjamin hadn't killed himself. (Imagine him
surviving to
live in NY and encounter a young Charles Bernstein in Central Park.) But I
understand why he did.  I might well have behaved similarly.  To call suicide
an act of cowardice is not helpful.  In our "just do it" culture sometimes we
need to extend a little more empathy--perhaps seeking clarification rather
than dismissing out-of-hand what scares us .     Enough.  Tom Beckett

Ron says:

Teach what you believe in, or don't bother. There's too much good poetry out
there to ever be covered in one college career, let alone one course. To
waste it on "official verse culture" is to simply contribute to the
a-literacy and poetry-phobia that innundates us all.


The more overt officiating here is precisely in your (Ron) imperative that
teachers should act as if their pupils are so stupid that they can't make
up their minds for themselves.  "Malpractice" - that's just petulant.

Whenever Jorie Graham is quoted to me it's always something about how
tiring it is, doing all this observing, or the endlessness of keeping
things going, the burden! Do I hafta? she seems always to be saying.
(Rhymes with NAFTA)

It's possible she's been misrepresented to me -- there could be lots of
joy, or even scrumptious emptiness there. David Lehman's poem "Big Hair"
in a recent TLS indicates some emptiness .. somewhere ..

Tom, bully for you. (I've known Tom fairly well for 12 years, folks, and
all I knew of what he reveals today, was that he was tall and had back
trouble!) In the USA of all places it is difficult to admit to depression,
"Hey Dave howya doin?" "Great, just Great, Biff! And you?" "Couldnt be
better!" Depression is often clinical, something's depriving you of your
serotonin. We can argue chicken-&-egg re psych trauma brings that on, or
that condition baffles others who react badly, causing pysch trauma. Kate
Braverman titled her novel _Lithium for Medea_ . I have friends who prefer
even the downer side-effects of Lithium, to the swings of
depression/hypomania.  But letting it all hang out is therapeutic, and not
just for oneself. I recall at my most unhappy, looking down from a 4th
story window into a parkinglot, but being unable to jump. My recovery
began there, I guess.

Recall these verses from "Trouble in Mind"?

"I'm gonna lay my head/ on that lonesome railroad line/ Let the 2:19/
Pacify my mind . ..  . I'm gonna lay my head/ On that lonesome railroad
track,/ But when I hear that whistle blow/ I'm gonna pull it back."


I mourn those of my friends who got to the first verse one time more often
than they got to the second.  db3

May be having an owly day, but all these suicides may have little to do
with poetry, hard as this is for me to see.  There are times that
neurochemistry, genetics, and/or thorny people and sticky philosophical/
socioeconomic situations might play a role, no?

Hm, Ron

That's a little hard, but...

Aside from the fact that many of the students in such a course expect to
read such poets as have been, um, 'canonized,' there's the way such a
course is structured to show what has been accepted in the two countries
(the US & Britain). In our university, at least, such courses have
different professors from year to year but much the same syllabus. I admit,
I used anthologies & they have a restrictive function. I added a small
collection by O'Hara, which was available, for example. Besides, one can
perhaps get students to see intereting differences when you place the kind
of poetry you like against some of the examples of 'official verse culture'
they have already been told is *the* form of poetry in the middle to late
20th century.
In other courses, less historical & specifically geographical in coverage,
I have taught *only* writers I love.
But there's also what I learn from teaching poetry that comes from a
'tradition' not my own... Also, I represented my sense of Hughes's work in
the sentence you take umbrage to perhaps too negatively: there are some
Hughes poems I can teach with real pleasure...

In this context, I like what Mark said about Jed Rasula...

On the other hand, the more I think about the new book the less I like it,
the more I find 'wrong' with the poems (usually, & happily, the moe I think
about a book the better it becomes). I am intrigued by the fact that I do
continue to think about it even as I have that reaction (& sit down to read
some Kathleen Fraser to clear my mind).

<<Douglas,

If, as you say,

"I'm not a great fan of his [T Hughes'] writing but as a teacher I have had to
include it in courses on post 1945 poetry...,"

you are guilty of malpractice.

Teach what you believe in, or don't bother. There's too much good poetry out
there to ever be covered in one college career, let alone one course. To waste
it on "official verse culture" is to simply contribute to the a-literacy and
poetry-phobia that innundates us all.

        I don't remember the details, but a few years ago, there was a widely
report study conducted at Iowa Writer's Workshop and perhaps elsewhere that
found extraordinary levels of depression among writers. Does any one remember
this?

Thank you to Tom Beckett.  There seems to be a certain ecology of rightness
when dealing with these realities.  We sometimes forget that words
& "posts" & "messages" are structured in the same way that larger media
& culture phenomena are structured.  The "Clinton-Diana-Plath/Hughes thing"
is subject to "spinmeisters" at every level - our snap judgements are
similar to snapshots on the cover of the tabloids, same structure, different
venue.

I feel unable to judge the "morality" of suicide or weigh the Hughes/Plath
sin on any scale.  Suicide has struck too close to home.  I think this must
be true for many on the list.  Nevertheless, the intrepid investigator
will win the day, and the truth will out.  It's a matter of finding the
right path between censoring information, on the one hand, and making
condescending snap judgements, on the other.  - Henry Gould

Subject:      query : Iraq

My 16-yr-old son came up with a strategic solution(?) to the looming
bombardment of Iraq.  I thought it was a good idea & called the secret service
about it (the only gov't agency that answered the phone with a human voice).
I've read that Clinton & the war planners came to a decision almost a month
ago.  After the condescending performance in Ohio I doubt they are open to
new ideas.  If anybody has any suggestions I'm interested.  I'm waiting for a
call now from "Agent Mooney" at the Providence office of the secret service.
(This is not a Blarnes-type joke).

Here's Alex's idea.  The US has painted itself into a corner.  It's a no-win
situation both militarily and diplomatically (not to mention morally).
The effect on public opinion of massive bombardment - the effect on relations
in the MidEast & elsewhere - EVEN IF SADDAM IS KILLED - are extremely
negative.  & he won't be killed, & the threat of retaliation will only be
increased.  This is the "worst case scenario" & it's fairly likely to BE
the scenario.
Alex says: the US should step back from an all-out bombardment.  They should
work with the inspectors & say: show us THIS palace; if you don't show us
THIS particular palace, we will bombard it on such & such a date.  This
reduces civilian casualties & puts the onus on Hussein if he decides not to
cooperate, leaves biotoxics on the site, puts civilians in harm's way, etc.
It forces him to keep moving his stuff, if he really has any.
Alex himself sees the weakness in this idea: basically, it will be unacceptable
to Hussein, as an affront to Iraqi sovereignty.  But even if Hussein
refuses - it makes him look intransigent, and it reduces the threat of blanket
bombardment. (Sadly, I'm cynical enough to think the Pentagon just wants to
try out their latest weapons in a real-life situation - that's why this idea
doesn't appeal to them.) All this is contingent on the outcome of Kofi Annan's
attempt to resolve the crisis.

I'd be curious to know, IF people think this is a good idea, how to
publicize it. No academic "chat" please.  What a bizarre "democracy" we live in
where it takes a high school student to force his father's generation to
grapple with the realities being carried out (Vietnam-like) in their name...

I wrote the following text for TapRoot Reviews a couple of years ago:
>I think that DEFOE is a work of genius on the scale of FINNIGAN'S WAKE, THE
MAKING OF AMERICANS, THE DISASTERS OF WAR and GUERNICA. But, while Scalapino's
work deserves comparison to that of Joyce, Stein, Goya and Picasso, it is
Kathy Acker's oeuvre I want to invoke here.  The universe of Acker's fiction-
built-from-fiction is abusive, apocalyptic and "in your face."The horror
(whore-her) of her narratives derives from the ways in which sexuality and
violence are casually, causally and explicitly intertwined. Something related
but different is happening in DEFOE.
>DEFOE effects a kind of dull affect, a resolute flattening of language
horizoning perception and consciousness, description and event. Fantasies,
autobiography, commentary on current events, film and DEFOE itself merge with
dream narratives to produce a landscape less blatant but more terrifying than
anything to be found in Acker's work. Scalapino's anger and passion are
evident but mightily restrained. Her strategy of understatement pays off in a
major way with DEFOE's overwhelming cumulative effect.
>Working out of received fictions, Kathy Acker's writing highlights our
culture's essential disfunctions.  Scalapino's enacts a backdoor move on the
received through a poetic phenomenology of the perceived in which "the fiction
is so transparent and separated that it doesn't exist."
>DEFOE is one of those rare works of art which will not be exhausted of its
meaning. And Leslie Scalapino is that rarest of writers--one that is utterly
awake.<

As a psychologist I think this kind of study is misleading - there are
extraordinary levels of depression at present across the board - there are
extraordinary levels among those who see the world as it is and not through
rose colored glasses.  There are depressions and depressions dysthmia, major,
seasonal affective, bipolar II, pissydayness, etc) and what kind
is measured is particularly important - there is an animal called creative
depression (kind of like darkness before the storm, see for example, Rosen,
David, _Transforming Depression_ and Jung, Moore, Hillman)

emptiness koans and the world grows empty.

on Sundays along with the blame I placed on her all these years. The bravado
I wear. The

there will be an answer. Tomorrow is the first day. The
tanager is scarlet.  Tomorrow is the last day of the

      Tom, I wanted to reply to your "depression" and "suicide" post,
      and just say thank you, but since others already have I will anyway.
      As for Acker and Scalapino. I like the comparison you establish
      in terms of "affect" and do find considerations of "emotional range"
      valuable aeshethic/ethical distinctions.
      Reminds me of Garrett Kalleberg's comparison of myself and Pam Rehm,
      That being said, I do not prefer Scalapino to Acker
      And do not prefer Acker to Scalapino.
      OR, there are times when I prefer one and times when I prefer
      the other. The "flattening" vs. the "manic-depression."
      One wonders if you would have agreed with your preference for
      Scalapino when you wrote the "depression" note.
      Sometimes gaudy calls the subtle boring.
      Sometimes subtle calls theatre gaudy.
      Prolegomenon toward a poetics of MOODS?

Re: the above.

The life and work of Hughes and Plath is in the public domain where people
may think of it or speculate upon it as they wish.  It is true that the
question of literary merit is not, in my mind, as pressing as examining the
moral issues pertaining to Hughes' publication of his poems about his
relationship with Plath.

I am not making a value judgement of Hughes as individual or poet, but
rather, as practitioner of the poetry profession.  We have no court of law,
no malpractice guidelines or official code of ethics, but, that doesn't mean
that we can do any damned thing we wish to do and call it poetry.  I believe
that the publication of Birthday Letters is unethical because it purports to
illuminate a "dark" relationship between two poets for examination by the
poetic community using poetry as an artifice, not as an integral tool in the
quest for truth.  The use of poetic form as apologia for a controversial
relationship between two poets, whatever their respective qualities, is at
issue here.

As for the matter of Plath's suicide, suicide has been the choice of many
people.  It may be strongly related to depression but it is equally related
to questions of honor. Philandering?...a quaint term.  Men and women often
philander while retaining more or less loving relationships in marriage, in
fact, I would suggest that suicide, in these cases, is the exception rather
than the rule.  The crux of the matter is whether Plath's suicide was
related to her soul, her poetry, her honor all of which could possibly have
been labeled as artifacts of depression by her husband, viz, the posthumous
destruction of parts of her work.

The retroactive victimization of suicides also disturbs me; it grates on my
belief in free will.  Most poets contemplate the fact of suicide at some
point in their life, many consider it seriously and some small number of
poets perform it.  The realm of truth is a noble battlefield, but not all
survive it.  For this reason, it is crucial that we understand the terms of
engagement and honor those who have fallen nobly.  I believe and dare to
state in this cynical world that poetry is still a vocation of moral and
ethical significance.  Characterizing the Hughes/Plath controversy in the
vein of the current soap opera in the White House connotes an insensitivity
to these moral issues.

Dear Aviva,

I really enjoyed your post and would suggest that rather than trying to
achieve a resolution to the question of where Jorie Graham fits that your
thesis embraces the uncertainties which are raised.  It seemed to me that
your post was able to explore a wonderfully wide range of material as a
consequence of being unable to settle on one position.

Two asides:

recently saw an ad in a newspaper:  Mynah for sale, almost talking.

And my wife Louise asks why do we say that we are below par if unwell?
Surely being below par is what golfers are striving for, i.e. it's a good thing.

all the best

Yes, Don, I can confirm that I read a similar study, although I can't
remember the numbers. What I do remember is that poets had the highest rates
of depression when compared to other types of writers. (Of course, if
they're all stuck in Iowa... )

My own experience, which is of course of no statistical value, bears out the
general implications of the study. As a friend of mine, a fine poet and
Plath scholar, once put it, "I don't know anyone interesting who hasn't had
a breakdown." My shrink puts it somewhat differently. She says that creative
people committed to their work have an unusually difficult time in this culture.

Although I am both a practicing poet and bipolar, I hesitate to make many
claims for the vocation of poetry as a destroyer. It seems as often to save
people as to gobble them up. In my own case, genetic inheritance seems more
to the point.

        Oh, no, I remember it and mention it only as evidence of a prevailing
popular notion that art is aberrant.  What I wonder about is the popular need to
think this?  Why was this minor study reported in my local newspaper?

        It reminds me of another affair.  Several years ago there were, if I
remember the story correctly, several murders on one of the Florida university
campuses.  The head of the campus policed was quoted in _The Chronicle of Higher
Education_  as saying, "Security on a university campus is very difficult.  All
kinds of people hang around campuses--drug addicts, hippies, poets."

Henry,
        Congratulations to Alex for his idea--a note of relative sanity in a
crazy situation. Unfortunately, he has it right about the weakness, and
it would also fail, I think, as a means of operant conditioning with a
guy much smarter than your average rat.
        Also unfortunately, Clinton's plan has the obvious flaw that if it hits
any biological stockpiles, an awful not of people live downwind:
Iranians, Khazakhs, Uzbeks, Turkomen, Tadjiks, Afghans, Pakistanis, &c.,
and while bombing one palace or site at a time might ameliorate the
damage from a full strike, selective strikes might also hold such a
threat for those people that to forestall another they might unite to
attack Iraq, as well as hit the US with 'terrorist' attacks [pot calls
kettle black]. We might get away with saying 'it's Saddam's fault' once,
but three or four times would certainly strain credulity.
        The UN's recent increase on the limit of oil Iraq can sell seems a good
way to avert a Versailles, but I doubt Saddam'll see it that way.
I think the guy wants to precipitate Armageddon. I think he wants us to
nuke a few sites, which would bring the Russians in; them 'n us could
blow each other into the stone age, leaving pipsqueaks like Saddam [if
he could survive] much stronger relative to the bigger, more ravaged
countries. How do you keep anthrax from spreading? Nuke it. The guy
plays hardball. We'd better hope our Bambino's pointing in the right
direction with his bat.

Douglas,

I guess my comment may have sounded a little harsh, but the idea that this
year's or even this decade's "canonical" poet will be read in, say, even 50
years is I think well up for debate.

I'm looking at my copy of New Poetry, edited by Harriet Monroe (founder,
Poetry) and Alice Corbin Henderson, published by MacMillan in 1925. The
poets who have 10 or more poems or 10 more pages include the following:

Maxwell Bodenheim
Hilda Conkling
Alice Corbin (ahem)
Adelaide Crapsey
Arthur Davison Ficke
John Gould Fletcher
Robert Frost
Wilfrid (sic) Wilson Gibson
Helen Hoyt
Vachel Lindsay
Amy Lowell
Edgar Lee Masters (24 pages)
Edna St. Vincent Millay
Harriet Monroe (ahem ahem)
Ezra Pound (18 pages)
Edward Arlington Robinson
Carl Sandburg (19 pages)
Wallace Stevens (16 pages)
Sara Teasdale
Allen Upward
William Carlos Williams (14 poems but just 8 pages)

Some of these folks are wonderful and will be read for centuries. Others
have already become opaque names (Allen Upward's contribution is entirely
composed of prose poems, most of which are just one sentence long).

My point here is that the idea that Hughes is, at best, a Fletcher, although
I suspect he's really a Ficke or Gibson, "successful" conservative poets
whose work was oddly anachronistic even 73 years ago (they were, so to
speak, new formalists avant la lettre). If you don't "buy" the work, then
it's very hard to turn him into a Frost and impossible to turn him into a
Pound, Williams or Stevens. Masters? Maybe.

Given notably more token treatment in this anthology are (among many
others): Conrad Aiken, Sherwood Anderson, Walter Conrad Arensberg, Rupert
Brooke, Joseph Campbell (the same!), HD, TS Eliot, Thomas Hardy, Fenton
Johnson (the one African American I recognize here), James Joyce, Alfed
Kreymbourg, Joyce Kilmer, DH Lawrence, Haniel Long, Wilfred Owen, John Reed,
Rabindranath Tagore, Yvor Winters and William Bulter Yeats. Completely
absent are ee cummings, Mina Loy, Marsden Hartley, Robinson Jeffers, Robert
Penn Warren, Paul Dunbar, James Weldon Johnson, Claude McKay, Jean Toomer,
Langston Hughes, Countee Cullen, Archibald MacLeish, Kenneth Fearing,
Stanley Kunitz, Robert Penn Warren and Hart Crane (just to thumb through
Alfred Kreymbourg's Lyric America, an anthology that attempts to cover a
much broader range of time and was published five years later).

My point is that if one includes a Hughes, say, on the grounds that he
represents some "important" force active in the contemporary lit scene, then
one should be including a very broad range of such forces, including
"popular" poetry and work that already tells us how such work fares over
time (maybe include that peculiar adjunct to the Berkeley Renaissance, Rod
McKuen, for example), you should absolutely be including works by such
omnipresent publishers as Greg Kuzma and Lyn Lifshin (as Don Byrd's note
points out), works from a wide range of different identarian modes and
creating what is really a sociological (i.e. "historical" avant la lettre)
reading of the work. Then it might make sense to include Hughes, Merwin,
John Haines, whomever. After all, we are all examples of some social
dimension acting through writing.

But if you're trying to introduce students to the reading and excitement of
poetry, then you ought to focus on what YOU find exciting (and if it
includes Hughes, then fine). But the idea that official verse culture
represents an "important" force is flat out disproved by history again and
again. Otherwise we'd all be studying Jones Very far more closely than we
have. Or Randall Jarrell. Marjorie Perloff has written on this phenomenon
quite wisely.

I don't blame Hughes for Plath's suicide -- nobody should ever lay that trip
on any of the survivors, frankly -- but his work's likelihood to survive
(that word again) in history as anything other than a shear footnote really
depends on her writing (some of which is tremendous) and the following that
it has developed over the years. What is creepiest about Birthday Letters is
not that Hughes knows this and now publically acknowledges same, but the way
in which these poems (to paraphrase a very good review that appeared in the
web mag Feed awhile back) compete with Plath, however badly.

Two other remarks:

Tom Beckett's comments to this list are among the most moving and important
I've read here in my four years online. I've lived around people with
serious cases of depression (my grandmother, who raised me, and a roommate
and very good friend Eliot Helfer who jumped from the Golden Gate Bridge 20
years ago this month) and have seen just how difficult (that word!)
everything in life becomes. Attempts to draw narrative lessons from such
complex situations (as too many do with Plath) are as reductive and silly as
the little morals CBS has been attaching to the winners and losers of each
Olympic event these past two weeks.

Second, I can think of way too many examples of male writers -- including at
least three who are household names on this list -- who've been subsidized
entirely by the work and financing of their spouses up to and including the
typing of manuscripts after coming home from a long day of work. This is at
least as much a situation for writing and poetry as it has been so many
other fields of endeavor. While there are an increasing number of couples
where, say, the husband takes over the childrearing and daily chores and
the woman has a career, or where the woman has inherited (or other) wealth
and it's not an issue of slave labor as such, there certainly are other
examples that just make you cringe.

Chris--
Thanks for yr posting.  It's not so much a matter of preference as of
strategy--trying to get an audience more familiar with A. to look closely at
S.
Mood is relevant in a discussion of  A/S.(Although I do hope that my recent
postings don't get me typecast as Mr. Moody--cousin to Agent Mooney!?--wonder
what's going on with that.)  I was trying to hint at larger structuring
concerns & differing but related poetics.  Both practice a kind of filmics of
writing which I might like to try and write around later. Was really hoping
though for input from the group. Maybe we could root around in their
respective texts co-analyzing some passages or constellations of connections.
Or perhaps a starting point might be  discussion of their respective uses of
repetition.

Ciao.

don & joe,
  actually, i remember that study -- had a snippet of it up on my
refrigerator in my last abode -- and it said that poets were much
LESS likely to be depressed than writers of fiction or drama.  i seem
to recall something about the stress of representationalism, but
perhaps that's a creative memory.

The Iowa study I recall concluded that there was a high incidence
of manic depression among writers. Unless, in other words, they
were bi-polar, they weren't likely to get much work done. It
was in manic or near-manic states that they achieved.

Don--
What I heard about that Iowa study was that though it did find an unusually
high instance of psychological problems among writers, the most interesting
finding was that the predominant problem among the fiction writers was
schizophrenia, and among the poets, manic-depression.

Seen in this context, Graham's  I-am-an-exhausted-participant-in-experience
theme may be as key to her popularity as her crossover forms, background,
etc.. Like Jordan, I find that this repeated stance seems gratuitous--I
titled my review of Materialism "Unnecessary Burdens"--and moreover quite
familiar, downright Romantic, in fact  -"half in love with easeful Death"
put that particular angst just as well, to my ear.

I find it depressing that the posts I've read re-Iraq while suggesting
modulations of the Administration's policy contain no apostates, only mild
heretics. Why is the Admin being taken at its word? I find it interesting
that, after Gulf War I, the sales of American arms were over the top. This
congeries of intellectuals might consider that these "Wars" are most
importantly demonstrations of how new weaponry works under actual
conditions, thus leading to a bonanza sale.

(Btw, is it a legal war or is it A Presidential Police Action, like the
last few illegal massacres? )

It's not a legal war: and this point--simple as it can be--needs to be
articulated.  One problem: to what extent does our current political
culture (in some Baudrillard meets Olson sense, our polis) allow for any
real democracy?  What would real democracy be like?  And how do we
subjects fit into our anti-polis--our language-worlds formed by liberal
democratic assumptions?  It feels horrible to ask about individual
responsibility--to even try to ask--in the televised micro-second before
the bombs.

Another cent or two: I in no way doubt that there's "a high incidence of
manic depression among writers," but I think other clinical diagnoses
play in here quite often, too, namely "personality disorders" like
narcissism, which would dispose writers to attempt what Lacan would, I
believe, call an attempt at fulfillment of "desire" for "a love that
proves to be impossible once one has entered into the system of signs.
(The 'union with the mother' is unachievable once the [m]other has been
named.)"  Hence, such desires cannot, ironically, be fulfilled by
writing, perhaps less by attention garnered from recognition for one's
"work," and even many quite "successful" writers become suicidal or
endlessly wrestle with self-destructive obsessions and compulsions,
impulses etc.  I am, myself, especially interested in differentiating
between writing produced by persons achieving a certain degree of
"psychological maturity," whereby the writing is no longer a reaction,
for better or for worse, to a perhaps misguided attempt to satisfy
"desire" and is, rather, an optimally focused engagement with the
materials and methods of signification.  In addition, I have a
suspicion, which I'm researching now and then, that Lacan's theory of
"individuation" (the process whereby one achieves psychological
maturity), being perhaps too heavily premised on the value of
"difference" is problematical: "I would go so far as to say that even
before slavery or class domination existed, men built an approach to
women that would serve one day to introduce differences among us all"
(Levi-Strauss); "Proponents of the degendering model have sometimes also
held that 'female' virtues or qualities--nurturance, for
instance--should be spread throughout society and replace aggression and
competiveness" (Nancy Chodorow) vs. "Others who argue for degendering
have at times held that women [read all writers, say] need to acquire
certain 'male' characteristics and modes of action--autonomy,
independence, assertiveness--again assuming that such characteristics
are acquired" (Chodorow) and, finally, "I will suggest that we have to
understand this separation-individuation in relation to other aspects of
development, that it has particular implications for women [read all
writers, again], and that differentiation is not synonymous with
difference or separateness"; further, "The argument here advances a
reading of psychoanalysis that stresses the relational ego.  It
contrasts with certain prevalent (Lacan-influenced) feminist readings of
psychoanalysis, in particular with the views advanced by French
theorists of difference like Luce Irigaray and with the Freudian
orthodoxy of Juliet Mitchell" (Chodorow).

Okay, smile, there's a lot of BS here, on my part, that is, and texts
should not be reduced to the personality factors of a given writer, but
I wanted to include this in the mix.  Also, I find Lisa Samuels
comment about poets being LESS likely to be depressed than writers of
fiction and drama and this having something to do with the stress of
Representation quite intriguing.

I like the suggestion of the son of Henry.  It's actually the second time
I've heard a similar idea floated.  The prior time was by someone calling
into Diane Ream's (NPR) talkshow.  If memory serves, that caller got the
short shrift by the powers that be that were featured.  Which is a pity
because it is a good approach, if you accept the administration's word.
The problem is that the administration has done what is typical of U.S.
administrations and painted themselves into a shortterm corner with some
pretty thick painterly rhetoric.  The painterly-ness of it so thick that
few are positing any alternatives and those are relatively minor.

As far as potential arms sales being a motivator, that may be part of it,
but the whole d*mn situtation is a result of bad long term U.S. policy that
strives for hegemony in the region.  Stormin' Norman's father led the
American Force in the '50s that installed the Shahs, which was finally
overthrown by a government that scarred the h*ll out of the politicians
here, who started pumping weapons into Iraq, etc., etc.  It rings of one of
those wonderfully quotable bible lines that goes something like the sins of
the fathers will be visited on the children to the third and fourth
generation.  Bigger lies trying to solve the problems from Big lies trying
to solve the problems from medium size lies trying to solve...

Thank you Steve Tillis--your post today speaks volumes to what I had
attempted to say in a post of
 Sat, 21 Feb 1998 09:47:17 -0500, from which I quote now:

"... there is writing in the face of wanting to die (even if that wish
is in denial)
... and all of this as I imagine it is "depressingly" normal in those
stratas of
society that produces self-identified poets. I have read Williams's
"Desert Music" this way. ... still, the willful pursuit of an edge
experience. I find it
impossible to deny that this has value for poetry: Artaud, Rimbaud ...
even engineers of formalism are often sadistic."

Sometimes the manic energy associated the pursuit of an edge experience
comes out as poetry ...
Some times as differently embodied actions ...
It can be "depressing:" for me to see how this energy is cleaned up
to make a presentable appearance ... that is what we are taught to do in
what I call the strata of society that produces self-identified poets
....
it may be obvious to the list maybe not, my critique of self-identified
poets rhymes with Olson's critique of "lyric interference" ...

that is one way to get at the nub of it for me: how could someone who
admired the beak of the ego so and was so often insecurely brash argue
against lyric interference...?

I am speaking of familiarities.

None of this touches on the situation that Tom Beckett wrote of ...
there are many admirable and heroic encounters for all of us with our
different realities ... our "Difficulties"

My comments do touch on "will" and "desire" and "impulse"--all maybe
relics of the 19th century to some on the list (referred to above as
--"engineers of formalism") -but things in some of us that do seem to
filter through the grid of language webs (to vitalize my formalism here
--grid and web two faces of an apparatus)

the problem with Jorie Grahm and it may be my problem too is how she
seeks to harmonize a discordant complex ...
why I like language poetry is because of the ways in which it sheds an
ironic light on the socio-material super structures ...
why I think Deleuze and Guattari have something to say is because of
their embrace of disjunctions
i am learning to live with my "schizzes" not paper them over ...

... that allows me to take up a position of empathy when I "experiment"
with words--as in what would someone know or feel if they were actually
to read or hear this? ... how often do all of us only read or hear what
we want to hear, what we are able to hear.

Yes I am posturing before Lacan's mirror now ..

David:  let's not forget that the issue is hegemony (read oil), and there are
many such serendipitous opportunities as weapons' testing, refining logistical
models and a new rational fofr funding increases.  I think the answer to your
question vis-a-vis the offical stance is due more to getting our news
exclusively by the mainstream (official) media.  No doubt there are many on
the list who are fully aware of the West's need for such a continued
projection of force in the Middle-east -- which is for me the larger issue.
In this context, air strikes and the like provide an opportunity for the
western alliance members to criticize US policy while accepting as a fait
accompli the US's presence -- and there are other benefits of such actions as
well.  This current episode is an example of the high stake's negotiating that
Iraq has been reduced to by the continued high death rate in Iraq that is
directly related to the destruction of its infrastructure and its  inability,
due to the US-led embargo, to effect repairs -- & the inadaquate levels of
medicines, foods and drinking water, etc.  I think you know all this but I
always find it reassuring when I find another empathetic poet.

I saw Madeline Albright on TV this morning. She stated unequivocally that
the question of whether there is a war is not one for the citizenry to make.
Nor would "their" opinions be heeded. This is a job for the real pros, I guess.

Tom.

Kathy Acker was an early hero of mine.  Back in the mid eighties I was =
at the end of high school & saw the documentary on her.  I thought here =
is the most way-out writing I've ever heard (after years of Romantic =
poetry at school) so I eventually tracked down an Acker novel, the =
British ed. of "Blood & Guts In High School" (which also includes "Great =
Expectations" & "My Death, My Life".  I faithfully read each & every =
word, one after the other, without understanding what was going on.  I =
knew nothing of appropriation, never read Burroughs, etc - it was just =
weird.  But I loved it.  I didn't really start to understand Acker's =
work until I went to uni & studied art history.  I came at her work via =
Minimal & Conceptual Art (LeWitt, Morris, Kosuth, etc) & also through =
music - Glass & Reich in particular.

When I think about repetition in Acker's work, those arpeggios of Philip =
Glass or the phase-shifting of Reich spring to mind.  On one level, I =
see her work as compositions, & there is a certain rhythm that's =
generated by repetition of phrases or blocks of text.

Afraid I know little of Scalapino - any tips on starting points?

Chris--
Thanks for yr posting.  It's not so much a matter of preference as of
strategy--trying to get an audience more familiar with A. to look =
closely at
S.
Mood is relevant in a discussion of  A/S.(Although I do hope that my =
recent
postings don't get me typecast as Mr. Moody--cousin to Agent =

what's going on with that.)  I was trying to hint at larger structuring

Or perhaps a starting point might be  discussion of their respective =

Uh oh, I find "desire," "materials," and "methods of signification" all
intensely, um, desirable. Is "desire" seen as narcissistic? As too
self-identified? Can the "I," desire, materials & methods of
signification all live together without being psychologically
immature?--oops, I almost wrote "psychologically insecure." Freudian

Oh, of course it's "legal," if carried out under UN imprimatur and
within the context of enforing UN resolutions. It's certainly not
"democratic," even if a majority of the UN or our allies support it, or
a majority of "the American people," whoever they are.

Paul Virilio's the guru here: war gets faster & faster--the ground war
phase of the Gulf War lasted 100 hours; present plans call for the
entire next 'war' against Saddam to last for c. 96 hrs. of air barrage,
with no ground troops at all.

The latest news I heard has Saddam agreeing with Kofi Annan to unlimited
access inspections--no doubt after he's accomplished much or all of the
covert actions his long stalling [call it 'defending the honor of the
Iraqui people'] has made possible, & no doubt he'll pull the same move
next time he needs to. This parallels the long buildups on our side
[call it 'restraint']--a hypnotic dance of cobras.

This all goes against the prime advantage of modern warfare: the option
for instantaneous action [somewhat compromised on our side because of
military downsizing and NATO foot-shuffling because of economic/trade
considerations]. Saddam's strategy: slow everything down, give America
a chance to develop a headache, then a conscience [he learned from Ho
Chi Minh, though the conscience has taken a bit longer to develop--but
hey, Saddam's no poet].

"Real democracy" would certainly not do well to depend on "the American
people," 80% of whom apparently favor a land war to take Saddam out [too
many action movies? too much NHL, NFL, NBA, WWF, KKK?]. In a country
with millions of "top secrets" [some of which might bring all the houses
down], real democracy is a pipe dream. Besides, as Lani Guinere pointed
out, democracy has the utilitarian disadvantage that minorities tend
almost always to lose. Thus, Bill Richardson & Madeline Albright can
afford to "commend" protestors for "practicing democracy" with no fear
of having to compromise with them, let alone capitulate to their
demands.

"Real democracy" would begin with the repeal limited liability
corporation laws, with political rather than merely economic
internationalism, and with the legalization of everything which doesn't
harm others, under the "unalienable right" of the pursuit of happiness,
no matter how dumb the means of pursuit. Anyone have any ideas about
implementation?

Joe--just want to make clear that I'm merely paraphrasing the newspaper
article, and that a couple of years after the fact. I think a book
was published on this connection by the woman who did the Iowa study.

Yeah, the music of Reich and Glass is  an excellent point of reference.
Especially since they are process oriented musics in which the process is
apparent, audible.

My guess is that CONSIDERING HOW EXAGGERATED MUSIC IS would be a good place to
start.  Others may have better suggestions.

Dear Poetics:

Some of Ronald Johnson's friends on this list may know in advance that in
November he suffered a stroke that caused a fall down a flight of stairs,
cracking 9 ribs and puncturing a lung. Not long after it was revealed that
he has two inoperable lesions in his brain. Currently he is under constant
care and confined to his house in Topeka.

For those that don't know his work, Ron completed his long ("don't call it
an epic") poem Ark in recent years, (available from Living Batch Press),
a work twenty years in the making, and which Robert Creeley has named one
great work of this century.

I am told by Peter O'Leary that Ron is unable to write anymore but recieves
mail gladly. His address is 1422 SW Tyler, Topeka KS 66612.

Thank you. Joel Felix

Maybe because I've spent a lot of time doing so myself I have a hard time
trusting people who haven't stared into the pit. They seem incomplete and
shallow.

But here's what I know about a particular suicide, a poet friend. With no
advance warning that anyone noticed one day while his wife and
nine-year-old daughter were out buying groceries he sat down on their
brand-new couch, put a gun in his mouth and shot his brains out. Talk about
leaving a mess for others to clean up.

I've been haunted for years by the image of his daughter walking into the
livingroom that afternoon.

I have no idea what was going on in my friend's head before he splattered
it all over the wall. I do know from my own suicidal days and from my
clinical work that many would-be suicides and suicide-attempters go into a
kind of rational trance--in my case the mantra, standing at a high window,
was, "I'm inside--I could be outside," or, when stepping into the street in
front of a speeding car, "I bet it won't hit me." What was lost was the
sense of consequence--"I'm going to die."

If the personal consequence of suicide is removed from the equation it
becomes a dandy weapon, and in my own case and in the cases of most of
those I saw clinically that's what it was--suicide as the final come-back,
the last word. And it's usually directed pretty precisely--a suicide note
often serves as a dedication, and my friend, knowing who was going to walk
through the door, didn't need a note to make the dedication pretty clear.

Yeah, I'm being moralistic. At my darkest moments I step back from the
window not because suicide is dystonic, but because I have a fair idea of
what that kind of death would mean to those I love.

A lot of great writing has come out of the struggle to cope with despair. I
think it was Ignatius Loyola who compared the dark night of the soul to
having fallen to the bottom of a deep well. But then, he says, you can look
up and see the stars.

I'm obviously not talking about the suicides of those with painful
illnesses or with Hitler or Stalin at their heels.

       _In the American Tree_ is an excellent anthology.  I suspect, however,
that in 75 years, Ron, if there is still such a thing as a literary history,
your choices are likely to look fairly quaint.  I wouldn't even begin to
speculate who will be the Pounds and Williamses and who the Hilda Conklings and
Arthur Davison Fickes in your TOC, but they will be there.  All in all, Monroe
and Henderson's editing seems to me quite remarkable. With the exception of the
African-American poets (and, of course, the reason for their failure to include
them was no doubt very different from their reasons for failing to include
cummings, Loy, Jeffers), they managed to include almost all of the poets who are
still remember from the period. I don't have information at hand, but at least
some of those you mention as missing would have been very young in 1925. If I
remember correctly Stanly Kunitz was born about 1910 and some of the others, I
am fairly certain, were born after 1900.

        Why am I arguing this?  It amazes me how anxious every seems about their
installation in the Wax Museum of American Poetry.  If the only end of poetry is
to be taught in Professor X's course or to be incldued in editor Y's anthology
or even to win foundation Z's prize (do you want guilt money from the inventor
of dynamite?), I am not sure I want any thing to do with it.  If there is going
be a poetry that does not belong to the orthodoxy, we cannot make an orthodoxy
of it. Are we supposed to be unorthodox until we are fifty and then expect the
orthodox to disappear suddenly from the field?

        There was a little book around in the 60s entitled _Teaching as a
Subversive Activity_, I do not remember the author's name, and I am not sure
that I ever read it, but the title has stuck with me.  Willy-nilly, it does
happen some times that you turn to be part of the establishment yourself, and
then, of course, you have to be especially scrupulous about self-subversion.  It
would have never occurred to me to teach Hughes, but it seems to me that, if it
can get such a violent reaction from you, Ron, I have probably been blind to
ways in which I need to subvert myself..

Oh. Bromige is so cynical in his regard of the US military/political nexus,
and especially here about the Gulf Wars.

Remember that the US bombing people said that they were not making war on
the Iraqi people, but on their political bosses.

Well, look.

Dont you see that the Iraqi people are now flourishing, while their
political bosses are crawling in poverty and disease and misery.

In response and agreement (and addition) to David Bromige's post.

I, for one, am such an apostate.



 Feb. 23rds headline in Time magazine is appropriate: Wall Street Goes
To War. The article notes: Like Presidential approval ratings, stock prices
tend
to inflate when the U.S. engages in armed conflict. Look no further than the
tireless bull market that we enjoy today. It began in 1991 when the U.S. drove
Saddam Hussein and his Iraqi army out of Kuwait. The first allied air raids
came
on January 17 of that year and sent the Dow Jones industrial average soaring
4.6% in a day. By mid-March the Dow had jumped 20%.
The point is illustrated with a graphic chart which ties the Birth of the Bull
Market to the day the bombing began.
Yes, sir! The generals on Wall Street do love a war, the article continues.
There's nothing like the smell of smart bombs in the morning ‹ as long as
theyre ours ‹ to arouse feelings of invincibility. And what better frame of
mind for dialing ones broker and cheerfully picking up another 100 shares of
Boeing or Lockheed Martin. With Saddam the Sequel possibly only days away
... it¹s no shocker that the market has hit new highs for the first time in
six
months.
With the massive collapse of capitalism in Asia reverberating in the board
rooms of stock exchanges and corporate headquarters across the world, talk of
a
severe downturn is commonplace in Barrons, The Financial Times, The Far
Eastern Economic Review, and the Wall Street Journal .
Wall Street is betting heavily on war.
Yes, Time continues, success in the Persian Gulf would vindicate all
those market patriots bidding up share prices. ... stocks of defense
contractors,
oil producers and oil service companies would be good hedges. Remember, those
generals on Wall Street wear suits, not battle fatigues. They don't really
know a
thing about war.
They do know, however, how to profit from it.
The Annual Report called The State of the Union concealed the $6 trillion
of debt in the United States and an arms budget that consumes 70 cents of
every
dollar.
Clinton¹s boast of an entire new generation of weapons, the military
arsenal of the 21st century, translates this way: smart weapons must be tested
against a country with no defenses, and with a gross national product less
than 1
percent that of the United States.
Pentagon sources tell Time that U.S. warplanes patrolling the southern
no-fly zone over the past three months have been practicing bombing runs on
targets that top brass figured they might ... have to attack.
Order of battle
Time  has the Order of Battle: The First Wave involves Tomahawk Cruise
Missile attacks by night and attack by Air Force F-117 Nighthawks.
Navy warships and subs armed with hundreds of precision missiles target
sites ... F-117 stealth fighters zip out of Kuwait flying undetected into Iraq
targeting communication centers ... with 2,000 lb. laser-guided bombs.
The Second Wave includes The EA-6B Prowler, EF-111 Raven and the F-
16CJ to jam ... radar .... making it safe for the bombers.
The Third Wave will see Bomb Laden Air Force B-1 Bombers from Bahrain
and missile-loaded B-52s from Diego Garcia aim for high value targets ...
launching weapons from high altitudes. Refueling planes ... rendezvous with
the
B-52s.
Wave Four involves Air Force F-15 Eagles and Navy F-14 Tomcats
patrolling the sky while F/A 18 Hornets, F-16 Falcons and British Tornados
roar
to attack.
Surveillance throughout the battle by ES-3A Shadow Jets ... vacuum up
Iraqi Radio Transmissions. E-2 Hawkeyes  scour the skies and ... direct the
attack.
Bomber squadrons will be launched from Incirlik Air base in Turkey and
from bases in Italy, Portugal, Spain, and Germany. AWACS, aerial tankers, and
support aircraft will depart from Saudi Arabia and 42 bomber squadrons from
Kuwaits Al Jaber air base.
The U.S.S. George Washington, U.S.S. Independence, launch destroyers in
the Persian Gulf, bomber squadrons from Bahrain, armored brigades in Qatar,
Air
Refueling Tankers in Oman, and B-52 squadrons in Diego Garcia will amplify
28,000 troops. 300 war planes on naval carriers will coordinate saturation
bombing around the clock for seven days.
On the eve of what is shaping up as the biggest combat operation of his
Presidency ... war is just around the corner. Time reports. No one expects the
operation to be bloodless. The White House has begun preparing Americans for
unpleasant pictures from Baghdad and less-than perfect results from the
battlefield.
There were 40,000 bombing sorties during the Gulf War. More bombs fell
on Iraq than in seven years of World War II.
Massive devastation
Nothing that we have seen or read could quite prepare us for the particular
form of devastation that has befallen this country. The conflict has wrought
near
apocalyptic results upon the economic and social infrastructure. ... Most
means
of modern life support have been destroyed ... and Iraq has been rendered a
country ... in a pre-industrial age.(U.N. Report, 1991.)
 Iraq has been devastated further by the seven-year embargo. UNICEF
estimates one million Iraqi children dead from starvation and the FAO in 1997
reports 1.5 million Iraqis dying from hunger and untreated disease. There are
no
medicines or IV bags, syringes,  insulin, asthma medication, antibiotics,
standard medications, or sterile health facilities.
The claim to be targeting biological weapons facilities in Iraq is absurd.
These can made in a portable lab. Anthrax or bubonic plague bacteria are
housed
in small vials. The largest producer of biochemical weapons in the world,
however, is the United States ‹ which refuses to ban them.
For years, this country supplied biochemical weapons to its client, Saddam
Hussein, to use against Iran. The Israelis, who delivered them to Iran for use
against Iraq, deployed toxic gases causing paralysis, vaginal bleeding, and
catatonia in Palestinian victims during the intifada.
The imminent aerial massacres prepared by U.S. rulers aim to terrorize the
Arab masses, whose profound disaffection threatens U.S. client regimes
throughout the region.
This is the true face of U.S. imperialism.

Good point.  As Saddam might say, "duh".  What I liked about Alex's idea was
it simply toned down the "total bombardment" scenario of the Pentagon. Let's
hope diplomacy works.  As I mentioned backchannel, the idea of promoting a
US teenager's bombardment plan sounds too close to Pynchon for comfort

        I don't know, David, but as I was reading the exchanges in Mike &
Dale's Younger Poets 7 last night (one of them hers) I was reminded of her
useful presence, & realized she must have gone walkabout. Reading that
thing is a very odd experience indeed, and leaves me with feelings I
haven't quite sorted out yet. I didn't realize that whole messages were
printed, with headers, so e-mail addresses too. I'd rather have been left
out, or had a poem in the issue, or something--a chance to choose, as Kali
Tal explained it. Your posts contain quite personal stuff. I guess it's a
useful reminder: Little Brother is Watching You! best, Sylvester

I apologize to Listpersons if some of this post seems odd....In a long
time of using it, I've never seen my e-mail software do this, but my
attempts to quote part of d powell's post seem to end in mangling it
somehow (at least that's the way it's appearing to me right now)...

Anyway d powell seems to feel that 1. I'm interested in conducting what
has recently been called "poetry wars" against Jorie Graham (taking her as
symptomatic of some large sinister tendency I want to anathmatize); and 2.=
=20
I'm suggesting her work as a teacher and administrator of writing programs
is to be looked down on.=20

Neither's the case; so powell's long post ("enuff" about Graham indeed!)
is not really rebutting things I said or intended...altho' I readily grant
that some of them are felt by folk on the list.  My point was more to
praise Rasula than critique Graham.  I'll repeat what I really said: I
don't find her work very stimulating or interesting; and I don't think it
is moving into the ambit of much of the contemporary work I like.  (For
instance, it would probably seem conservative and formally unadventurous
in The Art of Practice, or in Antenym or Rhizome or Texture..) There is a
place for different types of poetry.  Let a thousand poetix bloom.  That's
much the spirit of Rasula's work as a historian and analyst of poetry (as
it is, in his more expansive moments, of C. Bernstein, who evinces a
similar breadth and generosity of spirit (sometimes) toward poetic
tendencies wildly at variance with his own).  and I think in this Rasula
and Charles are good models for us.

=2E..Folks who haven't should definitely check out Wax Museum, and see what
I was really talking about.  And so, as DP says, "enough about Jorie
Graham!!"

Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII

        Those of you needing a time out from the Plath-Hughes wars might
want to consider reading what seems to me the BEST new book of social
criticism I've read in several years, Doug Henwood's WALL STREET. It's by
no means an easy read, but it will teach you more about how the U.S. is
run than any ten books on identity politics.

        Among the propositions that he seems, pretty incontrovertibly, to
prove:

        1) The stock markets do not effectively raise capital for business
        2) The stock markets are not a natural balance for the economy but
an artificial, bloated, corrupting force whose participants base their
actions on speculation, foolishness, lies, unconscious contradiction, and
selfishness of grandly deluded proportions
        2) The stock markets exist so that certain lucky individuals can
often STEAL money from business
        3) Wall Street and the stock-owning class contribute nothing of
significance to American life, while taking most of the money created by
others
        4) The main fiscal goal of the U.S. government is to take money
from the poor and redistribute it to the rich
        5) In short, that the elimination of Wall Street would benefit
EVERYBODY in the world except the 1-2% of the American and world
population who are made rich by Wall Street
        6) That the existence of large corporations is NOT the problem;
rather, that having the ownership of large corporations in the hands of a
hostile and self-proclaimed elite is a social mistake and a business
mistake
        7) That the scientific discipline of economics is not scientific,
barely a discipline, and knows nothing about economics
        8) That the possibility of socially owned banks and corporations,
that is, a system of MARKET SOCIALISM, could very easily improve the
economy of the world.


        But hey, don't take my word for it. READ THE BOOK.

Gwyn,

yup, the relentlessly generalizing tendencies we're all capable of, can be
frightening.  Your post is wildly amusing and the parallels you suggest
are quite apt.

More broadly (or more narrowly), I've made a vow to myself not to use the
"L word" from now on, on the List, or in my critical and theoretical
writings,...even insofar as possible in conversation!

And I don't mean "liberalism" (as a socialist I disagree with liberals
about *most* things, but I have no trouble using that tangled and troubled
word).

I made this vow sometime last week, when various posts to the list made it
fairly clear that the L-word has become more a tool in the hands of folks
who want to attack, than a helpful analytic generalization.

I figure it makes more sense to try to deal with Clark Coolidge or Susan
Howe, or Silliman or Perelman or Armantrout or Hejinian or Hunt or....By
name, and leave behind (or, aufgehabung, excuse my probably incorrect
German spelling) the moment when they were somewhat simplistically grouped
together under the L label....

Reading Rodrigo the Apostate got my blood moving on this mundane Monday
morning, just as a coworker dropped by to ask about my weekend and also
express relief at this morning's headline: "Annan, Hussein reach a pact on
inspections". Yes, that's good but does it herald true peace for Iraq?
Didn't a Russian writer once say that if an arsenal is introduced into the
Gulf in act one the arsenal must be unleashed by act three?

Or somewhat closer to home, that poet nut I love to love, wrote in Canto 74,
the general principle of the West: "never inside the country to raise the
standard of living/ but always abroad to increase the profits of usurers,/
dixit Lenin/ and gun sales lead to more gun sales/ they do not clutter the
market for gunnery/ there is no saturation."

Nuts quoting nuts. No one is interested in what poets dixit, nevermind Pound
or Lenin. "My weekend was fine. Yes, I hope this business with Iraq is over
soon. Gee, those Arabs sure are nuts." Straying from conventional wisdom in
the workplace is dangerous.

But after she left I read the lines under the head line. What I read in
papers and magazines, like you, is my only way of knowing what is "going on"
in the Gulf.

From the paper: "Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright warned that the
United States would not accept a 'phony diplomatic solution.'"

Albright always strikes me as a disgusting little booger, a true
contemporary statesperson, mouthing whatever shit is appropriate to finish
the job. My first reaction to this statement was to focus on "phony": phony
is what is not initiated by the United States. Or: a diplomatic solution
proposed by the US after four days of bombing Iraq would be "a genuine, real
diplomatic solution".

I read on: "The White House has said throughout the crisis that it preferred
a diplomatic solution." It is expected of the White House to say this.
Anything less would be uncivilized. Then, after it has been said, the
population is bombed. (Panama, East Timor, Cambodia, Iraq, Grenada: either
by US forces or forces trained and armed by US forces).

This made me question what exactly a diplomatic solution entailed. After
all, I have read "throughout the crisis" that the US was gearing up for an
attack. Is an attack or the threat of an attack part of diplomacy? Remember
the rumor that Iraq was plotting to assassinate ex-prez Bush? Our response
to this rumor was to diplomatically bomb Baghdad and kill civilians.

I read on: "an official at the weapons inspection team told The Boston Globe
yesterday that Iraq's pattern of obstructing inspections meant that even a
diplomatic deal does not ensure that inspectors will be able to do their
job" Nothing like a traditional American 96 hour saturation bombing campaign
ensures the ability to do a job!

"There is always the question of the devil being in the details," Pickering
said. Saddam Hussein "has tried to play cat and mouse for a very long time.
.. ."  A key detail not stated in the article is that the mouse is Iraq.

This post (of mine) brings me again to thinking about the Philly Talks, the
Derksen/Silliman exchange: what it means to me "to write poetry in the world
today." Too often it means paralysis, as opposed to writing anything that I
could make sense of, or live with . . .

Wish I could write more this morning . . .

Hi Doug & Ron:

For what it's worth: The best teacher I had at SF State was Michael Rubin.
Unlike the other teachers I had there (who all would agree with what you say
below) he brought in books for us to read that he claimed he HATED. One of them
was Kathy Acker's Great Expectations, the most important book (for me) I read
in college.  Rubin was my favorite teacher; I was incredibly sad to hear he
died of AIDS a couple of years after I graduated. He was, again, unique, in
that he brought things to us he didn't necessarily support, & admitted that
fact to us "God, I HATE this book! What do you people think?" I not only
admired that he held the job of teaching, of exposing us to a wide spectrum of
new writing, to be more important than his own tastes, I discovered many of my
now-favorite writers in his class. If I had had more teachers like Rubin, I
might have stayed in school.

Maria's point is an important one and in my opinion it's important to make
the list a place that *is* open to such discussions.

I have also known instances like this, and while the exact gender reversal
counterpart has without any question happened at some point or other, the
scenario mostly has worked out (from what I can see) as she describes it.
It clearly has to do with how men (and women) are socialized in sexist
culture to understand their own needs, and how exactly they understand the
commitment they've given to another person...

I also know of instances where some support comes to a woman poet from her
male partner's income, Mark.  But think about it for a minute: this is the
classic situation still of a predominant number of households. Namely, the
man is capable of making more in the job market than the woman. (But these
days, the woman not working at all is likely to be characteristic
*primarily* of middle-class and up households; in the drastic economic
straits of the last 15 years a large number of working-class families have
had no choice but to have everyone work who can, sometimes more than one
job..) And the skew toward the man earning more of the family's income has
everything to do with the fact that women's wages and salaries are
**still** way depressed systematically and deliberately below men's...And
gender discrimination in employment, and especially for well-earning jobs,
is *still* overwhelmingly dominant.  The "feminization of poverty" is
still, believe me, a very real and significant statistical bias in the
shape of the economy.

If a few woman poets have been supported by the income of well-employed
husbands, that is more an artefact of what's still a savagely
anti-woman culture and anti-woman economy, than it is a benign fact.

Well, that's a great demonstration from an anthology I confess I have not
read (mea culpa). And I take your point. But we can't know at all who will
last really, although we might just as well present the writers we find
most interesting to us. But that interest may include questions of
reception, & there the hughes/plath situation does have a reason to play in
the class.

I usually teach Canadian poetry, & there I have a number of writers I like
from a number of different 'traditions,' including our own George. But,
despite the difficulties (of non-representation in the anthologies) I do

I have only learned about some of the writers you mention since joining
this list, & then begun tracking their work down. For that I'm more than a
little grateful (but let's remember a half-year course, & the course
description too).

Still, thanks for the list of names & pages: it does speak many more
volumes than the one it was a contents page for...

        I finally just got around to reading William Greider's _Secrets of the
Temple: How the Federal Reserve Runs the Country_.  Although it is ten years old
now, it deals with a period that continues to be important: the Carter malaise
through the Crash of 87 (and gives an excellent history of the Federal Reserve and
U.S. banking from beginning).  It is a readable and lively, very detailed, almost
chatty, history.  At any rate, it gives the day to day feel of the institutions,
not much theory, but gives a very gritty picture of what happens when an
administration follows blatantly contradictory policies (as Reagan did).

        Thanks, Mark, for the recommendation.  I intend to read Henwood forthwith.

Ron,

First, an editorial note.  Your edition of the New Poetry is the second (at
least!).   My copy, purchased for like $5 at a huge used bookstore in
Milwaukee, is the 1917 (first) edition.  Its contents are slightly
different.  Also, I really don't see why the 1925 edition should be expected
to contain any Kunitz, for example, since as I understand it his work went
more or less unrecognized until his _Selected Poems_ won the Pulitzer out of
nowhere in 1959.  He had published one book by 1925, and I think it was even
reviewed, but still . . . .  Anyway, my basic feeling is that _The New
Poetry_ is a pretty interesting anthology, and the 1925 edition was probably
determined in part by the 1917 edition (which was determined largely by what
was published in _Poetry_).

Now on to my main point: a lot of us who teach decide on a syllabus for a
multiple reasons.  Your posts on this issue seem to me less than your
finest, since the reasons you can think of are very few:  teach what you
love; teach what you think will last (Jesus, when did _that_ come back?);
teach "sociologically," by which you appear to mean teach as many poems and
types of poetry as possible.

I believe my teaching to be sociological, but not in the sense described in
your post.  In my American lit 1915-1960 this semester, I am focusing on a
few poets -- Stein, Williams, Eliot (through The Waste Land), and Riding --
although I'm also using Cary Nelson's _Repression and Recovery_, various
handouts etc.; and the poetry section is framed by the 1917 New Poets and
the 1960 Allen.  Now, my syllabus is determined by lots of things: the prose
I'm teaching later, my choice to divide the class by genre, my sense of what
Duke juniors and seniors know and what they don't, my awareness of the
number of hours in the course overall, and the political and cultural points
I hope to drive home as the semester develops.  I have lots of goals: I want
students to develop a particular sense of history, I want them to be able to
apprehend poems in ways they haven't before, I want them to engage in a
particular relation to other Duke English classes, I want them to like the
poets I like, sure.  My point is that teachers' relations to classrooms are
overdetermined, and that you might not assume that you are able to judge
from a distance -- even with an abundance of hypothetical information -- how
other teachers might choose to get along.

But of course, you _know_ all this.

Cheers,
David

Mime-Version: 1.0

Looking through my own copy of Monroe and Henderson's "The New Poetry," I
find that the tensionless free verse of such contributors as Lee Wilson
Dodd or Maxwell Bodenheim strikes me as even more (out)dated than do
Ficke's George-Santayanaesque sonnets.  Workshop Mcpoems avant la lettre?

The point I gain from such perusals is that work without
[guts/chi/charisma/talent/
spirit/funk/kundalini/soul/heart/energy] (and even, sadly, some work that
does bear noticeable traces of g/c/c/t/s/f/k/s/h/e) is likely to end up
appearing a lifeless corpse made up only of whatever conventions it needed
to adopt--and since any art needs to use conventions, this will happen to
work of all schools equally, no matter how far "advanced" they may appear
at birth.  No set of artistic practices can guarantee success, or failure,
and just because some strategies--perhaps even including oppositionality,
and perhaps even originality--worked to harness g/c/c/t/s/f/k/s/h/e for
some poets in the early 20th century does not mean those methods have any
better odds of working in the present than any other approach.

It's hard to parse out all the variables leading to the present war
situation.

In the very dynamic movement against the last US aggression in the mideast
(the "turkey shoot" one), we used the slogan No Blood for Oil.  Now in the
long run, I believe that US policy makers do indeed wish to dominate in
that area in order to guarantee access to petroleum on acceptable
political and economic terms.... But that's probably only one factor; as I
think David's post implies, a major factor is the wish of the Pentagon to
justify its existence, protect itself from further post-Cold War
downsizing, and generally boost its P.R. in society at large and extend
the grip of militarism on U.S. culture.

What it has nothing to do with, is the badness of the Bath'ist state.
Saddam is a creature of US imperialism, strongly supported and armed in
the most vocal and assertive way by the Reagan and Bush regimes...till he
proved a not quite the puppet they assumed they had.  Is he an appalling
and evil ruler?  Yes..  As appalling and evil as Reagan, as responsible for
as many deaths thru criminal military action?  No, of course not.  And he
certainly is not being opposed by the Pentagon because of any of his
crimes!

The public involvement of poets against the U.S. war in Vietnam was a real
instance of poets making a difference, and involving their work with the
public sphere;....So this issue, and David's post, are I feel quite
germane.

Yes.  The notion that what used to be called neurosis is a precondition for
art is a particularly pernicious myth in our society, a way of
marginalizing both art and human suffering.

On the depression and poetry bit:

Kay Jamison published a book about seven years ago called TOUCHED WITH
FIRE about mani-depressive illness and artistic creation. She makes a
good case, from my point of view, that poets in particular have
extraordinarily high levels of manic-depression and depression among
them. While I find the book lacking in some of its aesthetic insights,
I do find the statistics she brings to bear quite convincing.

In the end, I don't find the relationship between creativity and mental
illness surprising. Nor do I find it disconcerting. While there are
many people with mental illness who are not in the least creative, it
seems that many creative people would be at the   edge of what is
considered "sane." Creativity always puts the creator at  risk, and
some people may be more inclined to take these risks. Or they may be
oblivious to them.

sylvester (or other)--

yr post reminded me ov the chip&dale thing; i wonder if you'd do me
a favor?  could you please either photocopy any pages frm younger
poets 7 that are attributed to me and send me a copy?  alternatively,
could you count the number of words of mine that were quoted (like
you, w/out my permission)?  the reason is, i'll be preparing a bill
for th publishers at th rate of $10 per word (Note to other publishers
--DON'T BE SCARED OFF!--: that's my standard fee for use of my work
without permission; the rate drops to ONLY $1 per word if you'll just
send me a copy afterwords; folks who secure permissions previous to
publication generally are charged at the Poets Union rate of
"contributors' copy").  i'm not too keen on sending money to these
clowns just to see a copy of my own work.

sorry to reopen a can ov worms...

As someone who spends a fair amount of time near "Wall Street" and "on"
Wall Street, I would like to echo Mark's comments. Doug Henwood shouldn't
be the only person saying what he does. I don't always agree with his
suggested solutions (for example, I think the financial markets might be
"used" in various non-capitalist ownership schemes), but he is basically
the only person in the public sphere (well, except for maybe J. Hightower
& several highly influential poets & academics) who is even hinting at the
right questions...

I've been reading Henwood's book off and on for a couple of months.  I
would like to second Mark's recommendation.  He is very right though: you
have to be prepared to work at it a bit.  But it is a great book.  As
subscribers for years to Henwood's newsletter Erika and I had been waiting
impatiently for the book to be finished for some time...

His newletter is called Left Business Observer, and it is both unique and
brilliant.  I strongly recommend it for people who think (correctly) that
understanding the economy is an important part of coping with our
day-to-day lives and struggles...

whoa, yeah, to pick up on david k's and don b's posts:  _teaching as a
subversive activity_, yeah, i think that was by---two guys, i think one was
mark poster, am i right????... i recall it as a somewhat evangelical
attempt to add mcluhan's insights to the humanities curriculum?... have i
got the right book?...

i'll report back here later on same...

but this opens to the question of teaching, which david k addresses
directly:  and i wanted simply to add to what he sez that the issues he
raises gets more complex in the face of different approaches to the
classroom context in general...

[please STOP reading NOW if you're academically undisposed]

for one, there's the matter of how you teach students to *write* poetry...
which i don't believe is entirely divorced, or should be, from how you
teach them to study it... there is something of a problem in having
students---even more self-directed, grad or undergrad students working in
collaborative groups (my tentative nod *here* toward a non-lecture based
class)---compose historically-grounded essays on poetry (e.g.) w/o having
thought through the poetic as it operates in said "essays"...

this is a HUGH ISSUE, esp. for me!... i am advocating, implicitly and
explicitly, a more open approach to the matter of form than currently
prevails in the (graduate and undergraduate) poetry *study* classroom...
and in the creative writing classroom as well... i would like to see, in
fact, more creative writers study theory, and more theorists study poetry
and poetics... and have both study something else too...

and in fact to stitch this together with the post from annie finch (LARGE
stitches):  i think this will help answer to the (imnsho) artificial
distinction, finally, twixt poetry and scholarship, and will help provide a
more bracing understanding of form in both... b/c in fact it's in isolating
one kind of writing from another that we end up with all sorts of
unnecessary mystifications re the writing process...

and if said process IS necessarily mystified, btw (we be all writing
zombies or some such), then it is mystified in all contexts, and all
forms... which is not to disallow what folks THINK they're doing...

at the same time:  this is not to deny, either, that we will or should
continue to utilize the conceptual and cultural categories of "poetry" and
"scholarship," to good and bad and in-between ends... but it seems to me we
would all do well to enter more fully into the specifically poetic status
of our discourses, and the claims we thereby (therethrough?) make... we've
(academics now) managed to do this wrt "theory," "rhetoric," and so
forth... but the metrical (i am being funny) realities of scholarship seem
nigh transparent to most who study same... at leasrt or esp. in terms of
their presumed necessity to "critical" thinking (as opposed, in general, to
"creative")...

to call out the advocacy i'm suggesting more directly, as a teacher of
something called "technical writing" for 8 years now (and, he sez, as a
former practicing engineer of 7 years):  of what use is a standard research
paper to a budding engineer?---i mean, wouldn't said engineer be as well
off trying to compose a ditty for a change, however 'miserably' wrought?...
one that attempts to get at, say, the emotional and ethical intensities and
dispersions of technology?... or does anyone really think that writing up
lab reports, over and over (and over), will make for a more
'fully-grounded' individual? (and a "better world"?)... or that endless
rounds of undergrad essays that spew out the "original insights" of others,
in mla format, is all that good a thing, ultimately?...

i am being harsh, intentionally so...

nothing against lab reports, mind you, or essays---but i'm questioning the
ways we, as teachers, pigeonhole discursive dispersions, and act tacitly
and not-so-tacitly to convince others that such dispersions are not only
natural, but necessary... part of bottom-line thinking these days too (to
pick up yet another thread---mark wallace's helpful nod toward wall street,
the book, the movie, and the reality), but way beyond what i'll venture
here... hey, i've gotta go teach!...

best,

joe

Hi, Katy:

Thanks for taking the time to respond to my earlier question.

I wasn't trying to deny an obvious history of oppression nor of gendered
readings. I'm open to discussions of both on this list (and elsewhere), and
hope that my asking you for more information, specific to the issue at hand,
wasn't seen as not being open. I was genuinely curious. Anyway, I'll have to
defer to what you say about readings of Plath's suicide being gendered (though
I really would appreciate specific references, here--I mean, they do help in
understanding, in seeing what you're addressing). Again, what I get on that
level is usually from other poets, in conversation, and none of those readings
had taken Plath's being a mother into the equation. People in conversation
(with me) have been much more critical of my friend Daniel Davidson's suicide
than of Plath's--though, of course, this probably has to do with the fact that
these people actually knew Dan, and were very hurt by what he did.

Thanks again, Katy.

Yours,

Gary

Right you are. As I said in the sentence following the one that's raised
the flurry, "Which is not to say that I don't realize that women's and
men's lots are different and that most women have different and perhaps
more obstacles to face." I exppect I'll get in trouble for the "perhaps,"
but the point of the post, such as it was, is that over-generalizing serves
no one's purposes.

        Last night on the X-files, just as I was leaving to catch my train
to take my sorry ass back to chicago, agents mulder and scully were
engaged in a dialog about getting their stories straight or possibly
facing prison sentences, etc, and Mulder says to Scully something like,
"because if we don't get it straight we're going to prison and your
cellmate is going to be called Large Marge and she's going to read a lot
of Gertrude Stein..."
        Stein also appeared in political news in Chicago about 3 weeks
ago when Jesse Jackson was quoted as saying, re: the Clinton Sex Scandal
that "there is no there there."
        (at least Jackson extended the typical use of that quotation to
account for something besides Oakland).

Hi Danny

I too found my way to 'experimental', ' Language', ' however you want
to label it'  writing through the study of visual arts; in particular
Minimalism and Conceptualism;( this study  also opened up minimalism
in music to me); I also found that the Italian arte povera movement
in some of the procedures and disjunctive practices they engaged in
have helped me in my reading of poetry; -- the presentation of
process and procedures, the use of sign systems;
in coming to poetry,  it is as though
different readers learn to read the work in different ways, acquire
different reading tools from other disciplines and as long as they
are prepared to use them in ways not always specified in the first
situation it can facilitate new reading;
I think that studying artworks has allowed me to look for things
other than meanings, to approach work not only interpretatively; I
also became aware of the paratextual elements and their contribution
to the work;
good luck with reading Scalapino -- her permutations and reptitions
will I think give pleasure

Luigi, et al. It is a can, & maybe I should have back-channelled DB. I
don't want to broker deals, nor act as enforcer. Dale Smith offered copies
to those quoted (after the controversy broke). I wrote asking for one, &
just received it, the first time I'd seen an issue of the magazine. It's a
good mag, lots of good writers in it--if I'd sent poetry I'd have been
pleased to be in it. But not in this way, particularly on a day when I was
short-tempered with Dodie Bellamy--my apologies to her. ( Of yours, I see a
short post of 26 Sept.)

Dear Listers,

        I've been checking out discussions with interest for some time, so
I'd like to say hello, and add just one comment to what people have been
saying about the crisis in the Middle East, an area I've written about
quite a bit.  Remember one thing: Middle Eastern oil does not primarily go
to the US but to Europe and Asia, particularly Japan.  As much as Saddam
Hussein is a dictator, one underlying aspect of the crisis is the fact
that the US is asserting its dominance over Europe and Asia through its
control of "our" oil.  As the Asian economic collapse and French (as well
as Russian) reluctance to go along with American-style globilization
continue, the threat of war, besides all its other causes and uses, is
very much a part of American foreign-economic policy in order to maintain
the US as the force that will "open" Japan's markets to American capital.
This is why, in my opinion, Clinton is willing to risk a region-wide
explosion in the Middle East. The stakes are quite a bit larger than the
region and the obvious hypocrisy of US policy in dealing with Israel,
Turkey, etc.

        Here at Stanford students have been roused and, since parents' day
is coming up soon, they will be giving an earfu of anti-war sentimnts to
certain well-known parents.

        In any case, thanks for all the fascinating discussion.

I wanted to thank Tom B., Steve T. and others for interesting and very
unsentimental posts about depression - and to solicit them (you) for the
upcoming headache and Scalapino nons -

The fact of pain - of physicality and all the specificities of gender, age
etc that it implies - exists in any writing, but it is sometimes put aside
with a sense of a neutral writer and reader - No one wants to whine or to
tell an I-overcame-the pain story with inspiring music - (well most of us
don't) - and yet we write with our bodies -

The degree to which thinking is embodied and this embodiment effects and
shapes and allows for a text is discussable -

The clausal quality of Leslie's texts for example and her speech with its
particular breathing (breathiness), levelness and hesitations - her singing
voice (which has been revealed to be amazing in her singing roles in K.
Killian's plays) - are all apparent in her work - and have as much to do (in
a completely intended way) with her physicality as with her Buddhism -
(floating world etc) - and poetics - It is a continuum -

I know that I'm not suggesting a new apporach to poetics particularly - just
urging toward one possible emphasis - theoretical but not forgetting the
physical situation and state of the theorist -

PS -

There is and will be more non today -  an additonal piece with small gif by
Myung Kim - (who is fascinating in the interview of her in the new Tripwire)
- revealing herself to be the foundational writer and teacher she has been
to a lot of the new writing that is going on in the Bay Area - AND OTHERS -

about which more anon -

Stein at one point was pop culture; she was able to sell a certain image
of herself and her work.  I have a copy of The Autobiography of Alice B.
Toklas which was a Literary Guild Selection in the 1930s.  My copy has the
"rose is a rose is rose" logo on the front in circle form (four roses,
actually, not three as is popularly misquoted.)

As for Jorie Graham, though I too am "aversive" to discussing her. I have
an extremely capacious taste in poetry and I think I am in good company.
Pound supported Frost early in his career; O'Hara thought Auden great and
Spicer admired Yeats.  The problem is when one living poet is lionized as
THE poet to the exclusion of everyone else, by a culture that doesn't
otherwise care about poetry. I remember when it was Robert Lowell; after
he died it was James Merrill.  On the other side of the Atlantic Larkin's
death made Hughes "it," as in a game of tag. Graham seems to one of those
names that is being proposed by "official verse culture" nowadays. I have
tried to read her recently but without success--it takes me years
sometimes to learn to read a poet so my initial impression of her style is
probably not worth much.

Still trying to get my hands on Rasula's Wax Museum...

Katy,

Picking up on your thread as well as J Mayhew....Aside from how we feel =
about the work itself, poetry in modern times has also always been about =
the cult of personality. Oscar Wilde, Dylan Thomas, Allen Ginsberg, Rod =
McKuen, Maya Angelou and  Charles Bukowski are wonderful examples of how a =
poet's popularity derives (at least in part) from extra-textual =
considerations, particularly the performative.
For others--Stevie Smith, Ezra Pound, Margaret Randall, Sylvia Plath, etc.-=
-Interest in their work has derived in part from interest in their love =
lives, their political lives, or their historical lives.

For Stein, widespread popularity did come in her lifetime--As Jonathan =
points out, The Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas was a Literary Guild =
Selection at the same time that her opera 4 Saints in Three Acts was =
enjoying an extremely successful run on Broadway, and she was solicited =
for work from magazines such as the Atlantic Monthly. When she and Alice =
returned to the US in the mid 1930s, they were celebrities, feted from =
coast to coast, culminating in a Hollywood party where Stein got to meet =
two of her idols: Charlie Chaplin and Dashiell Hammett. =

Did the success change her writing? Absolutely. Everybody's Autobiography, =
the followup to Alice B. Toklas, was little more than fluff, a kind of =
literary "Jaws 2: The Revenge." Her prose became much more accessible, =
much more traditionally narrative. Nevertheless, of her later works, =
Brewsie and Willie and Wars I Have Seen, are wonderfully innovative, even =
while making concessions to the audience that had at last found her. If =
Stein had languished in obscurity, perhaps the writing of her later years =
would have been spectacularly abstract. However, we should be thankful =
that her popularity as a personality is perhaps what initially drove some =
to be interested in her work; I myself cannot imagine when I would have =
encountered her had I not encountered her first as a personality.

As for the quote, I don't know the source. I do know that in her lectures =
she states that "once something is known it is no longer worth thinking =
about." =

And as for the roses, there were actually seven: A rose is rose is rose is =
rose is a rose is rose is a rose. My friend Chris once pointed out that =
when one utters the entire sentence, it soon sounds as if one is repeating =
the word "Cicero." Kids, don't try this at home.

Doug

P.S. Katy, I just received the latest Explosive. It looks fabulous. Thanks =

        I was just curious . . . reading the many passionate posts today
about either the Iraq situation and/or Wall Street via Henwood and
Grieder . . . whether folks on the list feel these concerns are NOT
addressable through poetry.

        That's what I thought last week about "dark and archtypal" --
that is, I thought a majority of people here would sneer at the idea
that poems would actually have subject matter of ANY kind (let alone
something so intellectually spurious as archetypes).

        I saw Jeff Derksen give a reading last week in Seattle, partly
because I admired his piece in _Philly Talks_ #3. He was introduced as
someone whose work was very much "in language" and yet also very much
"in the world" -- which I agreed with. I continue to think that a worthy
goal is to somehow incorporate these concerns (inequitous economic
systems, globalization, arms merchants, etc.) into the work -- certainly
not by any obvious means, but, if you will, alchemical ones -- which
reminds me that one of Pound's cantos refers to the Iraq situation at
the time of John Foster Dulles! (I'll find the exact quote if anyone's
interested).

        And a query on something completely different: has anyone on the
list seen the recent movie by Peter Greenaway regarding, uh, writing on
flesh? (Kim Dawn's post -- welcome back, Kim! -- reminded me of it, but
somehow I'm blanking out on the title -- _Pillow Book?_) Anyway, I
rented it over the weekend and was totally knocked out -- wondered if
anyone else shared this reaction.

Subject:      three unrelated queries and a note on poetic depression
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

Some information I'm looking for, if anyone has anything to hand:

1) I'm looking for books (preferably in English, although if there's
something good in French I'll take that too), dealing specifically with the
influence of Islamic poetic forms on the Medeival lyric in the West (a la
the tradition of courtly love), and, more braodly, with the influence of
Arabic culture on the European Renaissance. This is clearly a broad query,
so feel free to backchannel.

2) I'm also looking for any discussions of epistolary poetics that I might
be pointed to, especially those that might deal with contemporary work
(books on the Romantic and Augustan epistle appear to be a dime a dozen).

3) Might anyone know where (if it is indeed her?) Gayatri Spivak discusses
"epistemic violence"? I can't seem to locate that one, and my books aren't
ready to hand.

A note on poetic depression: having quickly gone through the barrage of
messages that appeared on the subject over the weekend, I flipped on the
tube to find that - I believe it was Dateline - was running a story on
manic depression (this was Sunday evening). I caught only the end of the
spot, where the requisite guest expert was in the midst of suggesting that
had Lithium etc. been around for 500 or so years, there would likely have
been no Van Gogh, no Byron, no Poe. (I believe a similar argument appears
in Kramer's infamous prozac book, where if I remember correctly he appears
intrigued, and genuienly excited,  by what a world without such creative
madness might look like and be like to live in).

In any case, it would seem a comparative, cross-cultural study of
depression, if one doesn't already exist, is long overdue. I'm aware of a
few things along these lines undertaken w/ regard to schizofrenia, or to
psych-analysis in general, and have been struck by what Catherine Clement
offers by way of such comparison in _Syncope_:


"In the art of Western psychiatric diagnosis, the psychotic is described as
being "cut off from reality," closed in him-or herself. Psychoanalysts have
often reversed the terms of the relationship between reality and the
subject. It is not true, they say, that psychotics are "cut off from
reality": on the contrary, they are invaded by too much reality, and no
longer know how to distinguish between themselves and the world. It is very
clear that psychotic states, especially deliriums with mystical themes, are
considered in the West to be part of pathology. This really needs to be
explained: in India, it is the other way around. Invasion by reality is the
norm."


I'm wary of Clement's binarisms (and her meladramatic romanticizations),
but I think her point should be well taken. Like psychosis, I'd imagine
that what's referred to as depression in the psychiatric establishment (an
establishment which in this country at least appears to have no sense of
relativism), might be regarded elsewhere as a viable cognitive mode. This
is clearly an oversimplification, but it's perhaps the failure of the
presently reigning cultural systems to account for such viability that has
led to the present state of things. (The presently reigning cultural
systems, of course, don't see art as viable practice either).

Thanks in advance re: queries.

Well, it cld be oif interest to others on the list, so I'll post it for
general consumption.

A good place to start is Maria Rosa Menocal's _Shards of Love_ (Duke, 1994)
and her _The Arabic Role in Medieval Literary History: A Forgotten Heritage_ ,
also from Duke UP. The bibliographies in those two will provide you with
enough reading for a while. But much much work is still needed in that area:
present topical dislike of Arabs is not new & western scholarship has spent
centuries _denying_ any and all influence. A good example is the etymology of
troubadour -- given by euro-american philologists as going back to a
hypothetical latin root "trobar" -- to find, they say. Ask an Arabist
knowlegeable in medival Arabic (hispanic medieval, that is) & s/he'll say
immediately oh, troubadour isthe same word as Arabic for "song".

 Then, if Dante is of interest in that matter, there is a fair amount of
scholarship on his work's relations to Arabic poetry.

Over the past few days, I have been reading Michael Palmer's sequence
"Seven Poems Within a Matrix for War" from AT PASSAGES.  On the whole, I
like the sequence, except for occasional maudlin lines ("Weathering so/
the wheel of days.//Gaia the bag lady/in sadness below.").   I have
been especially intrigued by these poems in the context of the entire
book because they place Palmer's familiar tricks, turns, and patterns in
into the representational anaesthetics delivered to CNN watchers seven years
ago:

        From the screen poured
        images toward me.

        The images effected a hole
        in the approximate center of my body.

        I experienced no discomfort
        to my somewhat surprise.

This is funny because the pretentious diction just barely disguises the
violent "image" of penetration and is so obviously not the result of the
shock of surprise.  The incessant broadcasting of the American bombing raids
have not generated a vivid representation of the body's anger but rather
the eviscerated representation of language's power to distance the body
from its outrage.

In the poem that I like best, "Construction of the Museum," Palmer discloses
"in the hole caused by bombs/which are smart" the incriminating remnants of
our warfare--"colored fragments" and a severed hand, "the writing hand."
The end of the poem is, to me anyway, a convincing retread of the "Ozymandis"
theme as well as of the idea that the preservation of language as poem is
an act of violence:

        We never say the word desert
        nor does the sand pass through the fingers

        of this hand we forget
        is ours

        We might say, Memory has made its selection,
        and think of the body now as an altered body

        framed by flaming wells or walls

        What a noise the words make
        writing themselves

The somewhat surprise of the last pair of lines is not parodic but precisely
understated, and therefore seems to me like a witty closure which reinforces
the institutional authority of the title.  In passages such as this one, I
think the self-reflexivity is neither obligatory nor gratuitous, since it
humorously forces (well aware of the meanings of force) a number of
questions about planned and unplanned word-play: how are poems which are
making a noise about violence complicit in that precedent violence?  If
the procedures of addition and subtraction, erasure and naming, repetition
and revision, impersonality and affect equally available to propogandists
and poets, then what might an experimental decontructive war poetry look like?
When do the syllogisms of postmodern poetry resemble the logics of postmodern
war?  Is the severed writing hand the trace of the weapon and/or its target?
I can't say that I know enough about either poetry or war to answer these
questions, but I am grateful to Palmer for helping me formulate a provisional
start.  Anyone familiar with this sequence or other responses to Operation
Desert Storm?  Palmer: "Yet the after is still the storm"

Well, this one moves me to speak.  Personally, I'm an apostate of the
Rodrigo Toscano school; the contradictions in the whole Iraq scenario, and
the moralism proposed by the greatest rogue state of all (and please reread
Rodrigo's post of a couple of days ago), make me want to leave the planet
(no, this is not the suicide thread... yet...).  I have no doubt that the
Pentagonistic Thinkers wd bomb a palace filled with Iraqi six-year olds.
But how about a palace filled with Americans (over 6 years old will do).  I
propose the Poetics List hold a conference in such a Location...

Told this to a friend (my fellow Montrealer on the List), and he dismissed
my conniving, saying: oh they'll bomb poets any day. I think that, more to
the point, no one would put themselves in the position I suggest.

Which makes me think of the film _Bent_, and the scene in the railcar where
the main character beats his lover to death to save his own life at that
moment, because he's been told to do it, and he knows the consequence of
refusing to do so is death.  But... at what point do you say No to
dehumanization?  And accept that by saying No, you invite your own demise?
LIke the people who set themselves on fire to protest the Vietnam war (an
image that springs to mind).

OK, I'll be quiet now... as quiet as a Canadian...

Joe,

I found The Pillow Book to be about erotic obsession but curiously very un-
(even anti-) erotic. Came away dissatisfied, feeling Greenway never was able
to focus on whatever it was he was trying to get across.

I do like Doug Henwood and tried to get him to do a column for Socialist
Review back around 86-87 only to be outvoted by my colleagues who felt him to
be too "popular" in his style (this was quite a bit before he ever appeared in
anything but his newsletter). I do have a friend, though (he's on this list
but I won't out him), who says that he uses Henwood and The Nation as his
investment strategy -- whichever companies they criticize, he invests in. He
claims to have made a lot of money this way.

Emilio García Gómez, Poemas Arábigoandaluces (1930) based on an

I agree with Chris that the marriage hearse causes the harlot. I disagre
that one cannot read syphilis and gonorrhea at work here. Marriage turns
out to be a hearse; husband visits harlot; harlot (by him or a hundred
others) conceives; husband carries VD back to the marriage; harlot's child
is born victim of VD, which can manifest itself in infants as an
eye-condition. I would argue (with Dante, though obviously he wasn't
discussing Blake), that one reads at the literal level first. But this
level yields in turn to metaphorical, analogical and anagogical readings
(flying by seat of old pair of pants here, so I look forward to correction
re Dante's advice on how to read). Society is fucked up thanks to
mind-forged manacles. Throw off yr shackles, throw off yr chains, drag out
yr landlord, beat out his brains. When a man has mnarried a wife/ He finds
out whether/ Her knees and elbows are only/ Glued together (Blake). Cursed
society that makes a woman so, blame it on patrinomy. Next.  db3

apropos recent threads about the canon, experimentalism, the rennovation of
more traditional forms/structures within the context of innovative writing,
etc., a question I wondered if it would be feasible to ask -- as a kind of
thought experiment -- is whether someone could write linear free verse for
the SAME REASONS that the Language poets didn't. this might not seem
possible, but something very much like this does happen in the visual arts --
there are artists after all who paint for the same reason that, say, the
Conceptualists didn't paint at all.  all of which leads me to Hank Lazer's
very eccentric book *Double Space*.  as the title suggests it's really 2
books -- a collection of somewhat traditional poems opens at the front, an
"opposing" collection of enormously intelligent & innovative poems begins at
the back & the two books meet in the middle.  the subtitle is *Poems
1971-1989* & it might just be that the material collected here merely
reflects Lazer's evolving aesthetic, except: 1. there is no real evidence of
a transitional or middle period, & 2. more importantly, the question I'm
begging is why publish such widely divergent types of poems in the same book?
 I'd be anxious to hear from someone else about this who knows Lazer's work.

Jacques - this is a very intriguing line of thought you've opened up.
I've only recently begun to read _Doublespace_ so I can hardly claim any
real familiarity with Hank Lazer's work. I would venture to say, though,
that his intention in publishing his earlier, traditional work in the
same volume as his later, more innovative stuff is partly to trace the
outline of a kind of aesthetic autobiography in which the reader is
compelled to ask your very question as to whether or not the book is a
bridge, or a way of framing discontinuities.

The gap between these two approaches - aptly symbolized by the curious
blank page in the center of the book - may be filled in, perhaps, only
by a shuttling back and forth between the two sections. The whole book,
in other words, not only begs aporia, but expresses a certain level of
comfort in dwelling in it. If looked at this way, then a transitional
layer of writing may not really be necessary. And what would such a
transition look like? That might be interesting. But it very well might
not. I see its lack as a refusal to mediate a certain anxiety about how
- and where - these two aesthetics connect - or don't.

I also see the binding together of this disparate material as a gesture
of generosity to Lazer's own beginnings as a poet, and to those whom he
revered, or learned from, in that line, such as Louis Simpson. The
project as a whole exhibits a willingness to embrace the disparate in
such a way that the anxiety about how they relate recedes, or is
subsumed by, that gesture. Or by the absence of a mediating gesture.
I'm not sure this is what Lazer intended and I'm far from  feeling sure
if this holds any water. I've spent more time in the back of the book,
among the marvelous legal poems,  than in the front - though I did read
a lovely poem about a golf swing there.

I don't know Lazer's book, but I think (in principle) that any form can be
used with any intention. The aesthetic "meaning" of a form is not
inherent formally, but is ascribed to it at a particular historical
juncture. A certain kind of "free verse" became identified with normal
"workshop" MFA writing at a particular time and thus mutated in its
aesthetic significance.  I'm not sure if this answers the question.

In the short space of your reply to Joe, i realize that it is probably all to
easy for me to misinterpret what you mean by focus here, but seems to me that
he (Greenway) may well in fact be quite successful in getting his ideas across
by avoiding any notion of focus. I am thinking, in this case, of Coolidge's
_The Book of During_ and how with the same worn out subject matter, Coolidge is
able to look it somewhat anew by looking aslant, askew of it (that is not to
say automatically or as stream of consciousness though). There is (I believe)
something fiercely erotic about the tangential approach.

Best,

Gary -

thanks for that very thoughtful post on Palmer. I'm reminded of his work
in _Sun_ which also engages in some of the themes you talk about.

If you can find it, you might want to look at Lindsay Hill's book _Kill
Series_ which was written in direct response to the Gulf War. It was
published by Arundel Press in a very limited and expensive edition. Some
of the poems I believe may have appeared in issues of Sulfur or Caliban.
His extraordinary long poem "Socket" - which I know for sure ran in
Caliban a few years back - also deals to some extent with the larger
cultural issues raised by the war (Randolph Bourne: "War is the health
of the state").

Lindsay may know whether any remaining copies of _Kill Series_  are
still available. Backchannel me if you want  his number or address.

Vaudeville without Organs was the legendary performance art group comprised of
Jessica Grim, John Byrum and myself.

A few years back the three of us were co-coordinators of the Earwitness
reading series in Cleveland. VWO was born during a late night talk fest with
Bruce Andrews at John Byrum's house.

Jessica's stage name was LaGrim and she could be a pretty stern presence.
John and I both have less stable personalities (at least that's my theory) so
we had dual names.  John went by Da Mike/Da Spare ("Where Da Mike goes, Da
Spare comes").  I was known as Shecky-Sheena (aging jokemeister and Princess
of Power).

Originally VWO was conceptualized as the first L= poetry slam team.  We were
on the cusp of  a world tour but dissolved the group when we couldn't agree on
matching jackets.

Danny--

The audible processes of Glass and Reich might compare pretty well to
Scalapino's work.  However, maybe the better analogue with Acker's work is
John Zorn's collage style pieces built from recognizable and sometimes not so
recognizable samples.

Hope this coming weekend to get at S/A more better.

have just gotten to page A13 of the NY Times for 2/24 (news carrier
couldn't get through the floods to our door, so I'm catching up this
evening) --

There's a report here out of Lexington, Kentucky, that Gayle Jones, whose
novel _The Healing_ was just released, was in the hospital following an
episode in which her husband filled their cottage with natural gas and
threatened to blow them both up.  The paper says that the husband killed
himself, and that Gayle Jones is being held at least temporarily in a
Mental Health hospital because of fears that she might harm herself.

Does anybody have any updates on this?

_The Pillow Book of Sei Shonagon_ is an absolutely gorgeous book--in the
way that Greenaway makes a gorgeous (visual) movie (I've not seen
"Pillow Book," but one of my favorite movies [be warned: it's harrowing]
is "The Cook, The Thief, His Wife & Her Lover"). What I love about
Greenaway is the sense that he loves literature for all it has to offer
as literature & films for all they have to offer as films. I think he
tries to make his visuals as resonant *cinematically* as images are
resonant *literarily* in books. In other words: I think he has true
sensitivity & respect for books, and is trying to get at their magic
through his film work--without being simplistic & simply reproducing the
book. Aw, whatever...just check out his movies!

I'm looking for interviews/articles about Erica Hunt, and specifically

I hear that Village Voice Lit Supp had a review in 93 or 94 of _Local
History_ along with CD Wright's _Just Whistle_, but the VV online
doesn't seem to have a search option.

Enlightenments much appreciated...

Hello

I've been out of the list immersed in my thesis on Ashbery, whose poetry
actually comforts me and makes me happy but I can't resist this.

Being raised by a clinically depressed father who used to tell me I'd
grow up to be depressed and for such a long time I was, I consider
overcoming depression to be the most important thing I've done with my
life and critical to my becoming a poet at the age of 31.  That journey,
which required me confronting so much sadness and crying nearly everyday
(and much talk therapy) for several years, a fact which made many think
I should go on anti-depressants.  I didn't.  I consider the crying to
have been such a gift, which actually helped me feel quite alive and one
day this past summer I realized the weight had actually lifted.

One of the critical moments was, 14 years ago, reading "A woman is
talking to death" by Judy Grahn, a poem in which the poet calls herself
to task for her own acts of ommision in loving women who needed her.  We
can't love everyone in need but how often do we deny our community, not
realizing that community can save our lives?

I live, temporarily, in Boulder, presumably a happy blissful place, with
so many lonely people and a 'community' that seems vacuous to me and
quite unwilling to confront any unpleasantries.  I often wonder if
despite the fanaticism over physical health, people here don't die just
as quickly of heart-ache.  I find American Buddhism easily distorts its
notion of overcoming suffering as ironing out struggle and difficulty.
To speak your mind here means being considered 'negative.'  I don't mean
to be romantic but how I miss nutty New Yorkers who will have a decent
conversation at the drop of a hot dog.

Action and involvement with people, caring about something seems so
crucial and just what we aren't supposed to do in our materialist
culture.  Activism and the friends I have met doing activism, people who
by definition have my back--has also saved my life.

tired thoughts,
RAchel levitsky

P.S. Another thing that my depressed father used to say to me is that
those of us who are depressed know that it is the most dreaded fact of
our lives, that we would never chose it.  I agree with him.

Rachel,

I once heard it this way: Buddhism goes up, focusing on the spirit.  Depth
Psychology goes down (into the body, I think), focusing on the soul.  Both are
cool, I guess, and could complement each other, I guess, but they don't substitute
for each other.  Make sense to you, too?  Steve Tills

To add a bit to this tangled thread: I recommend Andrew Solomon's article,
"Anatomy of Melancholy," in the Jan. 12 _New Yorker_ (before they stopped
doing anything except Clinton and sex).  I've read a lot of these
depression/bipolar memoirs, having suffered repeatedly from the black dog
myself in younger days (before the dinosaur elavil and I became buddies),
and this is, to my mind, one of the best (and shortest) in the genre.  The
essay is informative both on the emotional and medical levels, as well as
(dare I say it) being at times witty--

Alan Davies' book SEI SHONAGON (hole books, 1995) is worth remembering in the
context of this discussion. I don't know if it is still available. SS is 185
three-line stanzas of haiku-like meditations.  Thoughtful, gorgeous, haunting.
A couple  of sample, out-of-sequence, stanzas:

We wear on the outside
what we can't countenance within
until it wears us out
***
So often nothing happens
and then when something does
noone notices
***
If a gust of wind disturbs a flower
and a flower a gust of wind
and then how not one lover another
***
Exchanging body parts in verse
or in those letters out of time
to keep what is yours mine

I wouldn't get too bent out of shape due to my comments, Aviva-I am
hardly representative of the "poetry listserv circuit,"  nor of any
"Langpo Disciples"(! ), as will be abundantly clear from the review
excerpted below; I imagine my perspective on Graham is likely to be
very different from theirs. A couple of people have asked how they
could see the review, "Unnecessary Burdens," and I'll post it on my
website by next week for any who are interested. In the meantime, since
I regret descending into a too-hasty synopsis of my ideas from the
review, here is the gist of the comments on Materialism therein:

By the way...Jorie's well loved on the poetry listserv circuit...as you

Silliman, and all... Annette'll know what I mean...Don't you, Annette?


<fontfamily><param>Palatino</param>Excerpts from "Unnecessary
Burdens"(review of L. Gluck, J. Graham, J. Cooper) published in North
American Review in 1995:


Here are three new books by ambitious and influential poets who suffer
under burdens. It may be a poet's responsibility to suffer no more than
is absolutely necessary, but deciding how much suffering is necessary
is, alas, probably not up to the poet. The burdens in these books are
common ones, important ones in our culture. If they sometimes seem
self-imposed, they may be all the more tragic because of that
unnecessariness. If the suffering sometimes seems willful, in the
tradition of the Romantic poetic ideal or even the belated Romanticism
of Confessionalism, these poets may be all the more generous in
offering themselves as examples to us all in this post-Romantic age, so
that we might all better understand our own willful suffering.

         [here follows a review of Louise Gluck's The Wild Iris]

        Though the wordy, dramatic musings of Jorie Graham's fifth book,
<underline>Materialism,</underline> seem at first far removed in
inspiration from Gluck's ascetic lyricism, Graham's work in this book
is fueled by a similar self-limiting situation. Graham's chosen burden
is not religious but philosophical: these poems are obsessed with the
supposedly universal difficulty of perceiving and communicating about
reality.  . .

        [paragraph describing book in general]

The irony of [Graham's] book is that the poems, despite their angst
over the impossibility of communication, contain many fine moments of
effective narrative and lyric writing that do just what they fret about
being unable to do.  In a typical sequence in "Young Maples in Wind,"
the speaker goes into a long digression addressed to the reader, asking
"do you taste/salt now if/I say to you the air is
<italic>salt</italic>," and proposing that "we,/together,/make a
listening here . . .," before proceeding to a magnificent closing
lyrical address to the maple leaves: "and you, green face-mournful,
tormented, self-swallowing, graven,/navel-and-theory face, what is it
you turn towards, green history-face,/what is your migration from?"
Some might argue that, in workshop jargon, Graham "earns" her lyric
ending through the self-conscious doubt and questioning about her
rights and power as a writer that precedes it; it is, on the other
hand, equally possible that the philosophy dilutes and distracts from
the passages of concise and  powerful poetry that this book contains.

        Graham's lack of faith in language's ability to communicate jibes
strangely with her overall style, an extended and ambitious version of
the unstructured free verse of the 1980s "workshop" lyric. Graham's
aims are, of course, much more ambitious than those of the typical
lyric. She grapples not only with fundamental metaphysical questions,
but with political and historical themes such as the Holocaust,
abortion, and political persecution. The fragmentary, meandering,
apparently transparent style allows her to approach and back away from
these themes, to question and doubt her ability to write about them,
and occasionally to pounce directly on them in moments of wonderful
writing. But there is something paradoxical about the use of the
workshop style-with its idiomatic diction and syntax, its lack of
conspicuous rhythm or rhetoric, and its attendant illusion of
"naturalness"-as a vehicle for meditations on the artificiality and
difficulty of writing. We seem to be being asked to believe that the
speaker's idiom itself is pure and untainted language, that somehow it
is an honest, ingenuous, and direct representation of her thinking.

        Of course it is not. It is not that Graham's meditations are not
generous and valuable, for they are; it is impossible not to admire the
speaker's openness to emotional experience and the untiring vigilance
of her thoughts. But the apparent belief in some fundamental level of
uncrafted language lends the poetry an insistent flatness of effect
that might benefit (and does, in occasional narrative poems) from the
distance provided by an authorial mask or persona. As it is, Graham's
most interesting poems sometimes form Robert Browningesque dramatic
monologues in spite of themselves, as the speaker's own theoretically
hidden personality peeks out from behind the language's
not-so-transparent-after-all surface. A poem called "Notes on the
Reality of the Self" that includes phrases about acting from Constantin
Stanlislavsky uses this fact to excellent effect; it is a charming poem
that shows Graham's too-seldom-tapped gift for comedy.

        It may be that for all her efforts to tackle the abstract language of
Western metaphysics on its own terms, Jorie Graham's best writing is,
after all, the poetry that addresses other issues than philosophy and
allows itself to engage, as best it can, with the world and its
manifest aspects.  This book's stories and descriptions are what stick
in the mind. There is the teenage boy waving a gun, "as if trying to
sharpen himself for entry," "acid, /rare, in support of progress,
/looking for what he's missed," "tentacular, spitting seed, him the
stalk of/the day, scattering seed, planting it deep-" and the terrified
subway passengers in the wake of the trauma: "wet branches? what was I
wearing?/and then much later, like a dream, desolate, things being
talked about." There are the staunch and sad little girls in the
concentration camp. There is the tragicomic moment when the speaker is
reading <underline>Anna Karenina</underline> and stumbles on the
objectification of the heroine: "Vronski's eyes/ fall suddenly on her
so that her being seen is/ born. I tried to see past her. But her black
waist/blocked the whole view,/black hourglass the stillness would use
to enter,/swirling, breathless/yet in itself nothing." There is the
narrative of finding a monarch butterfly-almost a sentimental story,
grounded in the tradition of nineteenth-century women's literature-
that essentially comprises "Subjectivity." There is the lyric address
to the maples quoted above, and other equally gorgeous closing
passages, like the address to dust: "oh, but tell me, morning dust,
dust of the green in things, <underline>on </underline>things, dust of
water/whirling up off the matter, mist, hoarfrost, dust over the
/fiddlehead . . ."  Such beautiful and captivating writing is the kind
of poetry that matters to many readers; to find it right now, Graham's
readers have to push through much less "poetic" terrain. Obviously this
is part of the point, but just how essential a part of the point may be
open to question.

In addition to what others have pointed to (poetry related to Operation
Desert Turkey Shoot)....

The wonderful piece Erica Hunt reads on Live at the Ear seems (complexly)
related.  I don't remember its title....

        We've lost a great poet. Henny Youngman died yesterday (at 91 or
92, two different news reports.)

        DICHTEN=CONDENSARE, Pound said,( incidentally, using the equal sign
long before L=A=etc.), and Youngman was a master.

        "And for my nephew Marvin, who was always asking me to mention him
in my Will, 'Hi, Marvin!' "

Does anyone know German?  Does "dichten" really mean "condensare"?  My
dictionary has "verdichten" for "to condense."  Dicht apparently means
thick, and Die Dichte is a noun meaning density, but I suspect that the
connection between "dichten"( to write poetry) and these words is tenuous
at best.  Can anyone confirm or disconfirm?

On a different note, does anyone have bibliography of secondary sources on
Coolidge (the poet not the president).  Please back-channel.

Yup.  Henny was great. He'll be missed.
As to Pound, he may have used the = sign befor L=etc, but did he mean it?

These seem to be two separate verbs:

1. dichten = to thicken, to tighten, to condense.

2. dichten = to make poetry.

dichten (1) is related to Eng 'thick' [= Germ 'dick', etc.] and Eng.
'tight', whereas dichten (2) seems to be a borrowing from Latin, as in
Horace's 'dictare carmina.'

The next question is whether Pound meant 'dichten' = 'condensare' as a pun
or as an etymology....

Jonathan -

Dichten = writing, and specifically poetry. See title of Goethe's
autobio "Wahrheit und Dicthen" usu. translated as "Poetry and Truth." So
Pound's famous formula simply means that the art of poetry consists of
the act of condensing or compactinglanguage - less is more, if you will.

I think the big P. took that word from a particular Germ/Eng dictionary and
stresses this in the ABC's near the front.  I can't remember the translator
and not knowing German can't confirm equivalent 'meanings' for the two words.
Chances are you're right and it means something slightly different.  Anyway,
I think there's some space devoted to this in that brick of a bio A Serious
Character.

It was actually a German - Italian dictionary.  Pound attributes the
discovery of this folk (faux) etymology to Basil Bunting.  I was playing
around with a translation program from German to English.  I wrote the
German sentence "Ich dichte die Dichtung," trying to say I write poetry
and it gave me "I seal the seal" as the English translation.  When I tried
to say "I write condensed poetry" it gave me "I seal the thick seal."
(dichten also means to seal, as in sealing with wax).  I find this
altavista translation program hilarious, since it isn't very sophisticated
or attentive to context.  I am thinking of putting some Lorca in in
Spanish and seeing the translation it comes up with.

I always read it as an explanatory metaphor.
"Heavy with time."
I'm reading a book on the physics of time (time's arrow); the 1st essay
in 1st paragraph says that the General Theory of Relativity shows that
gravity IS time; gravity is the expression of variable time flows.

Thought I'd post this poem of mine in which Youngman appears, as a kind of
homage.  I liked his rapid-fire aesthetic very much and recently
downloaded hundreds of his jokes off the web.  -m.



        POEM BEGINNING WITH A LINE OF O'HARA'S

        Rome is gorgeous...like the Catskills. There is no sense
        in trying to get there other than by traveling
        north on the New York State Thruway,
        and no sense denying that the Pope
        is none other than Henny Youngman.
        That he has no wife, according to the vow,
        makes the joke that much funnier.
        In the audience, a man dressed vaguely
        like a Hell's angel grows more and more
        anxious.  His tank-top reads, *I Live
        Every Day in FEAR*.  Yes, he does.
        He peels his fingernails and eats the pieces.
        It is impossible to discourage his belief
        that, behind the scenes, Youngman has been conspiring
        to get Senator Kennedy elected president.
        The fact that Youngman isn't even Catholic
        makes it that much more nefarious.  When
        you ask him he says, "ZOG, my friend,"
        which stands for, "Zionist Occupation Government, my friend."
        Rome is gorgeous.  His beard is like the gray
        and red streaked rusted shingles of the ruined
        cottages you happen upon, hidden in the wooded nooks
        of the Piazza San Pietro, except it is made of hair.
        If you ask him, he will pose just as Moses did
        for Michelangelo, fingering his beard and scratching
        his belly, "guardian of the tomb."  He is a descendant
        of the Lost Tribe of Israel, the tribe whose existence
        Pope Youngman vehemently denies, out of fear
        of its gorgeousness.  "It is more gorgeous than Rome,"
        he thinks to himself, but to the audience, he tells
        a joke about how ugly it is.  The old couples
        come from an afternoon of meringue lessons, the young
        families who have brought their children after
        a swim in the pool, they all laugh at this joke,
        a bit anxiously.  It is Easter and they have come
        to receive his blessing, not expecting such levity.
        Their Pope begins, "In nomine Patri, et Fillii,
        et Spiritu Sancti," and they respond, "Amen."
        Their Pope continues, "I had a nightmare last night.
        I dreamed Dolly Parton was my mother and I
        was a bottle baby," and they say nothing.
        It is all gorgeous.  The way the lake glitters,
        the tall loud speakers between the pines, the lanterns
        strung across the Arco delle Campane.  The man believes
        that as they empty into the square they all study him,
        amazed by how his gut-sweat has stained
        into his tank-top an image of the Virgin Mary.
        The publicity is awful, he shivers in contempt
        at the complication of what he has devised, to lumber
        into the gardens, ahead of the New York State Police
        whom he has already told, "The one I will kiss
        is Youngman.  Arrest him and lead him away under guard."

Pound wasn't exactly Mr. Linguist, as has been noted with regard to his
work from the Chinese (he believed one could understand kanji by basically
staring at them until they made sense--I could never do those random-dot
3-d pictures either) and from Sextus Propertius with his "frigidaire."

Dichten Condensare was my voice teacher the year I spent in Florence. His
father was German, a blond Lutheran from Luebeck,introspective and stern, a
mathematician in musical matters; and his mother was Italian, raven-haired
in her youth, passionate, extraverted, always bursting into extravagant
gusts of Verdi. Both sets of characteristics were at war for Dichten's
soul, and some do say one set won out when it enlisted the help of the
Devil (Teufel). Certainly Dichten came to a sticky end, drowned in a
wetland area trying to remove an illegal dwelling so that he could landfill
it and build a music studio; but not before he had passed the Condensare
name along to his son, whose mother, Brita Bunting, had been a mistress of
Ezra Pound. Hope this helps.


The Altavista program sounds like another such program I heard of that fed
"Out of sight, out of mind" into a russian-speaking computer, and got back
"Invisible lunatic."   David

Would like to announce the following reading at the Cinnabar Theatre on
March 9th, 7:30 p.m.

STEVE FARMER, DAVID BROMIGE, and PETER GIZZI will read poetry and
discuss The Troubadors.

The Cinnabar is located in Petaluma (approximately 40 minutes north of
San Francisco), at 3333 North Petaluma Blvd.  The Cinnabar Series
website at http://www.vom.com/stills provides a detailed map of Petaluma
and additional information, including previews of the featured readers'
poetries.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Upcoming Poets/Panel

                March 9th, a Reading and Symposium with
              Steve Farmer, David Bromige, and Peter Gizzi

                    The Troubadors at the Millenium:
  a reading and panel investigation of current poetic practices and the
              apparent weaving-in of practices of the past.
    Three poets read and talk about their and each other's work as it
 relates to, and calls back to, the work of the French Troubadors of the

                        11th and 12th centuries.
                     An Open discussion will follow.



Steve Farmer was born and raised in San Diego, California.  He received
a BA in Writing from UCSD and moved to the Bay Area in 1981.  There he
completed an MA in English at Sonoma State University, studying under
poet David Bromige.  He is the author of Coracle (working notes of
february, 1987), Tone Ward (Coincidence, 1988), World of Shields
(w.n.f., 1993), Standing Water (hic jacet, 1995), and the long poem
Medieval, which has appeared with other work over the years in
publications such as AVEC, Lyric &, Mirage Period(ical), Poetics
Journal, Big Allis, and the collections I am a Child: Poetry after Bruce

Andrews and Robert Duncan (Tailspin Press), The Poetry Calendar for the
Millenium (Sun and Moon Press), and Writing from the NEW Coast (o·blêk
anthology).  He has worked and taught in the restaurant industry for
most of his life and is currently Executive Chef of Venezia in Berkeley.

David Bromige has been around for a long time.  An original troubador,
with interesting scars sustained in falls from ladders pushed off from
balconies (usually
by the ladies themselves), his lifetimes of romantic egotism have soured
him on the
cult of personality and he refers readers to his recent poems found in
Tinfish, The Dickens,
Boo, Crayon, Antenym, Lower Limit Speech, Letters, Volt, EPR, Poetzine,
Non, Rhizome,
Capilano Review, Cuisinart, Mirage, and 3300, if they want to deduce
anything
further about him.  All of his books have been burned by the Papists.

Peter Gizzi is the author of several fine books of poetry, including
Artificial Heart (Burning Deck, 1998), from which he'll be reading;
Hours of the Book (Zasterle, 1994); Periplum (AVEC, 1992); Music for
Films (Paradigm Press, 1992); Creeley Madrigal (The Materials Press,
1991) and the chapbooks Ledger Domain (Timoleon, 1995) and New Picnic
Time (Meow, 1995).  He co-founded o·blêk / A Journal of Language Arts in

1986 and co-edited with Connell McGrath the o·blêk anthology of younger
experimental poets, Writing from the NEW Coast (The Garlic Press,
1993).  He's also the editor of the international literary anthology
Exact Change Yearbook (1995), and he has an edition of Jack Spicer's
lectures on poetics, The House that Jack Built, forthcoming from
Wesleyan University Press (1998).  In 1994, Peter received the Lavan
Younger Poets Award from the Academy of American Poets.  He holds a B.A.

in Classical Literature (New York University), an M.F.A. from Brown
University (1991), and a Ph.D from the University of Buffalo.  An
assistant professor at UCSC, he lives in Santa Cruz with his wife, the
poet Liz Wallis.

Subject:      Dichten Condensare, chap.II
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

Inquiries have started to come in as to Dichten's having an Italian
surname. His grandfather, though from Luebeck, was the son of an Italian
sailor, Antonio Condesare, who hailed from Naples, and who married Frieda
Mann of Luebeck. The second 'n' in his name got added during the family's
Luebeck years. The name of Dichten's Italian mother was Ingrid Rossellini,
the outside-of-legitimation daughter of Isabella Bergman, a Swedish
housemaid in the well-to-do Milanese household of the Rossellini family,
whose son, Roberto, invented the first, clumsy and awkward
computer-translation program, EierAnsikt, during his years in
Friesing-am-Isar, and whose favorite riddle was "Is a bell a berg, man?"
Returning to Milan for a grand vacancy, he made real the fact that he had
most of his life been at love with the white-haired person of clean-limbed
ascendancy yet dubious paternity. Propositioning her, he then with her to
Luebeck fled, expending the remainder of his diurnals with his Baltic
companion not a hurl of a rock from the water-body that bears the name of
her type till this instant. Their offspring, christened Dichten,on account
of his born having-been with musical ears and tightly-sealed eyes, during
his wanderjahre found himself in Florence, where his acoustics were so
great he decided to stop behind. The rest is Chapter I. Although perhaps it
would not have been supererogatory to say that indeed, yes, he enjoyed
punctually 24 years of amazing celebrity as a performer on the soft-loud
keyboard thing-that-goes-in-the-drawing-room, and also as a chanting-person
of his own homemades. Then came the swamp. To this sixty-second unit, I can
attend his thorax in my kopf Der Margarita Song warbling. Then comes the
Moral. Life is not brief enough.  David

Well though Gwyn, "frigidaire" is deliberate in a way I can comprehend, a
chosen anachronism (with which device "Sextus Propertius," as you know,
teems); whereas the "drawing-the-sorts" "method" whereby he downloaded
Chinese poetry from Chinese written characters I cannot. Yet by both
methods he made fine poetry, don't you think?  "Outweariers of Apollo will,
dum de dum; we have kept our erasers in order." Too old to look anything
up, David

You know, EP just claimed that he could divine the meaning of Chinese
characters by looking at them.  He did the translations in Cathay using
Fenellosa's notebooks from his studies with a Japanese teacher, with each
character copied, glossed, phoneticized, etc.  There was relatively
little information on the grammar or the paratatic syntax and that he had
to come up with on his own.  He had a native speaker assisting him when
he did the Confucian Odes while residing at St. E's, though he reportedly
quarrelled with her alot.  He also drew on Jesuit latin versions for his
other Confucian translations, as well as French versions.  But its a
great story that he could figure out what the signs meant just by
looking, and as David points out, he made great poetry out of them,
however he got there.

mistranslation would be gratuitious"

After his time at St. Elizabeth's Pound was something of a broken man and was
reportedly very bitter.  He is rumoured to  have spent his final days
wandering  the streets of Rapallo talking to himself. One passerby thought he
said "I was dicked and conned--and sorry."

The German verb "dichten" does not mean "to condense" but to "block" the
holes or openings in an object in order to prevent air, gas, or liquid
getting in or out. I guess "to seal" would be the nearest English
equivalent. The idea, however, is not to achieve "poetic density" but
rather to preserve a sense of unity or wholeness. More fragments to shore
against our ruins?

Could you explain this interesting concept a little further?  Are you
saying that Pound's idea - behind this expression dichten = condensare -
is to preserve unity or wholeness?

It seems to me, and as some others have already pointed out, the basic
point Pound is making here is: "to write poetry is to condense", i.e.
to sharpen, shorten, achieve precision and depth through brevity.
Perhaps this is assuming too many a priori Poundian sentiments.
   Are you suggesting that Pound may also have been playing with
this other meaning of "dichten" - to set a seal?  I think the image
of "setting a seal" was extremely important to Pound - he was always
aiming for the effect of a visual emblem on a number of levels - a
Renaissance, iconic imagism.  I'm not sure how your
focus on achieving unity & wholeness relates to the word "condensare",
but I can understand the sense of an author "setting a seal" on a work -
the overall, pervasive, unique signature - the "total" icon.  His father
worked for the mint; Pound made Pound notes cohere as heavy crystal;
with all the arch-reactionary elements of authorial "totality" set
up against the non-visual, ultra-verbal splurge of Joyce or Stein.

...but what were you saying? I mean, how does the whole equation imply
preserving unity or wholeness?  Is it that the process of condensation
leads finally to "setting the seal"?  - Henry Gould

"Basil Bunting, fumbling about with a German-Italian dictionary, found
that this idea of poetry as concentration is as old as the German language
itself.  Dichten is the German verb corresponding to the noun Dichtung
meaning poetry, and the lexicographer has rendered it by the Italian verb
meaning to condense."

This is the quote from the ABC of reading that got all of this started.
It's on page 36 of the edition I have.

Thanks to all those who answered my original query;  I suspect that dicht
meaning thick or dense comes from the same root as the English *thick* and
that the dicht of Dichtung (poesie) is completely unrelated.  It makes a
nice story though!

David: I didn't have the book & was going on memory, but it's in ABC of
Reading, 36, beginning of Chap 4, where ep says first "Dichten=condensare,"
then goes on to say "Basil Bunting, fumbling about with a German-Italian

Hey.

Ah, Ezra! Somehow, all roads seem to lead (however circuitous) back to EP.

Another implication of "condensare" is to think of soup --or stock, at
least. We (or I, anyways) cook stock "down" to instill it with all the
yummy goodness of its initial ingredients --to condense all the "meaning"
of the stuff we began with into the stuff we're left with. From
"mere" language into poetry. (What was it Pound said about poetry being
"langauge instilled with meaning to the highest degree"?)

(Ah! My first post.)

But I may be mistaken.

to second aldon's recommendation of my pal andrew levy's _continuous
discontinuous_---some kinda writing, check it out...

the book also includes, to dredge up an old thread, one of my favorite
back-cover blurbs, by none other than our very own rod smith:

"Andrew Levy is a Buddha."

(((hey rod, please don't bother explaining it!///

thanks, tom, indeed. i've assumed that many of us have been speaking with
more than academic knowledge and/or investment in the topic; you are the
first to say so openly.

the book has long been a fave of mine, but didn't see the movie.  the book
is great to teach, but the movie seems obsessed w/ the erotic aspects of
the book, which are there but much subdued.

Just got my 12 year old copy of the difficulties db issue & I want to
say to tom b that it is a very likeable representation of david's rather
large & humorlavish world.  I especially enjoyed the annotated
bibiography in which david fills the unknowing in on the thinking behind
the books, books which I have never seen, & well there just arent any
David B book in the LaFarge libary out here, in fact there is not a book
by anyone on this list in the LaFarge library, can you believe that?  So
even after reading thru snippets of most of the writings glowing with
chumness, what stays with me the most was that picture on the front
cover, David looking like a doublebreasted oxford citation.  Is that
really David B?  I mean, Ive read a lifetime of db via this list in the
last year, & according to his writing he cant look that way.

Looks aside, I was intrigued also by the piece which bromige intersects
bruce andrews...each word commafied in a grand scrolling word movie.  &
revealed that David is a collaborators collaborator, a genre that
interests me at this point in my writinglife far more than solo shtuff.
My only hope is that someday David knocks on my door inspired to twist
words with me.

tom, something very very satisfying about works dedicated to a single
author, is there anyone doing now what difficulties was doing then, is
difficulties still?

THE LITTLE DOOR SLIDES BACK, by Jeff Clark

This is the 1996 winner of the National Poetry Series
(selected by Ray DiPalma). Jeff's book is an amazing
first book of poetry -- an amazing book under any cir-
circumstances. This is the book many of you have been waiting
for!

           Tonight he wails in the tub like a baby --

           "Shave it!"

           "I will wade into the Pacific and kiss my mother!"



$10.95 (paper)


EUREKA, A PROSE POEM, by Edgar Allan Poe

The newest selection from the Green Integer series of
belles-lettres works, this brings back into print (in a
single-volume edition) one of Poe's major works. It is
a very strange piece, indeed, as Poe takes on the the
scientific world in attempts to prove metaphysical poss-
ibilities.

$10.95 (paper)


POEMS, by Sappho

A new translation (based on the earlier Anchor edition) by Willis
Barnstone fo the great Lesbian (truly a "Lesbian," from Lesbia) poet.
We all know Mary Barnard's great translator, but unfortunately hers
was based on a corrupted text, in which the original editor had
added (in Greek) missing lines and texts. This is one of the best
editions of the true Sappho work available.

$10.95 (paper)

We'll have more books very soon. And watch in May for our exciting
new bi-annual journal of International Poetry: MR KNIFE, MISS FORK. New
poems by major international poets, commentary, and short reviews!!

Early subscriptions may be obtained from Sun & Moon for a 20% discount
from the price of $20.00 price (that's $16.00 for two issues).

You are right, there is something especially satisfying about focussing in on
a single author, single topic.  It becomes possible to present multiple views
of what you have on hand and to show connections to wider concerns.  I tried
to use __The Difficulties__ as a way to, on one hand, shorten the response to
an author's work &,on the other hand, to advocate innovative practice more
generally.  I''d love to do that sort of editorial work again but the money
commitment is beyond my ability at this point.  I'm amazed that I was able to
do it before without grants, etc., just through pure hustle.

Currently, I know that Rod Smith should have the Bruce Andrews AERIAL out
before too long.  If it is as good as the Watten Issue it will be spectacular.
Rod's work as an editor and poet is getting better and better all the time.
Talisman may still be doing some special author issues. I haven't read that
mag for a year or two so am not sure what Foster's up to.  Otherwise I don't
know what is going on.  There have been rumors for a couple of years about a
special issue of new mag called BURL being devoted to Bob Grenier--who is long
overdue for such attention.  If I could find a sugardaddy I'd do it myself.

The Bromige cover is a good likeness of DB.  He's a remarkable artist and an
even more extraordinary human being.  It's a privelege being on the same
planet.

Lunch time over. Gotta run.  More some other time.

i regret having to burden the list with something that is specifically to
do with moi, but i couldn't think of a quicker way... so herewith the
'works cited' (as it were) of my online piece (the one i've mentioned
hereabouts before)... i'll be adding to this piece only a bit, methinks,
twixt now and four weeks from now... and if anyone out there has any
problems/objections with my having repro'd some of your work, or work under
your imprint, please to let me know... excerpts from poetry appear with ***
(i realize i won't reach everyone by posting this list, but what the
hell---i'm using this work b/c i LIKE it, and would be only too happy to
'feature' other work if asked)...

if my online piece, or some version thereof, is published in print, i
suspect i may not reproduce the poetry, as i suspect the publishers will
have much to say as to what permissions i'll have to seek---in writing of
course... but IF i seek same, those affected will thereby be contacted
formally...

note the media slippage here---and i WILL be reading much of the poetry
aloud during my presentation...

anyway, apologies for the interrupt, and thanx to all for bearing with
me... all remarks &/or curses backchannel, please...

yr humble & obedient servant,

Miekal -

non will be doing various single author issues - The first will be on Leslie
Scalapino and next on Jerry Estrin -

Ed Foster has done single author Talismans and Rod Smith Aerials - and of
course the new J MacLow Crayon - Such issues are fascinating and useful, but
I would note that there are few about women -

 i. e. Has anyone done a Susan Howe or is one planned?

Back to Laura M.'s comment about focussing on female writers.  I agree
absolutely.  My experience though was that I contacted a number of women
writers and I didn't have success in getting them to participate in a
project--with the exception of Susan Howe.  Finally I ran out of gas and could
no longer sustain the project.  I deeply regret though not doing anything on
Hejinian, Scalapino, DuPlessis, Ward and several others.  If I ever have the
resources and opportunity I will remedy that.

Tagging is great, on the Amtrack north from Manhattan to Albany
just around the beginning of the Bronx are some great tags, visual and
poetic, yet at the same time criminal?
-poetry on walls, colorful, often moving (on trains) blurred, short and to the
point(like Creeley) , criminal (?)
-In the parking lot of Buffalo's Albright -Knox art gallery I watched someone
tag one of the moving trucks all white and clean with a sparkling new message,
As the security guard chased that person down Elmwood Ave, I remember (

anything inside-cherrio folks-J michel basquiat would have liked that.

Ironwood: 2 issues on George Oppen, one on Duncan, one on Dickinson/Spicer

Credences: one on Irby, another on Metcalf/Duncan

I shdn't have used the phrase "single author issues" since what we were
discussing was mags devoted to critical takes on the work of a single author.
I do think such mags have a singular role to play and that we all could profit
from having a few more of them around.

Poets need more venues.  I've been writing for over 20 years and have never
had the opportunity to publish  a full length book  and not for lack of
trying.  This is not a unique situation.

I would challenge everyone on this list who has not had the experience of
editing/publishing a magazine or running a reading series to begin to do so
sometime within the next year.  It could be frightening.

Kevin Killian's Mirage issue on John Weiners

Laura's point is well taken. Talisman is just abt the only mag one can point
to doing features on women. Pretty amazing that no one has done an issue on
Lyn Hejinian yet. There was a fine issue of Jimmy & Lucy's House of "K"
dedicated to a survey of Tuumba titles & included an interview w/ her. Can't
think of anything else.

Pretty sad too that of *that* <<u=n=a=m=e=d>> g=r=o=u=p, there isn't yet a

Kind of peripherally: I've been reading Claude Simon's _Tryptich_ (which
is amazing) and the density of cross-cutting images & naratives, the
pure luscious accretion, keeps reminding me of both Greenaway &
Shonagon.

A thought serendipitously addressed by this quote attached to a message
received early this morning:

Contemporary trends of thought imagine that art is like a
fountain, whereas it is a sponge.  They have decided that art should
gush forth, whereas it should absorb and become saturated.
They think it can be broken down into methods of depiction,
whereas it is composed of organs of perception.

In humane response to the above outcry for MORE VENUES,

we at _Sycamore_ wish to offer our services.  _Sycamore Review_ is in its
tenth year of publication, and, yes, Tom Beckett, it IS hell out there;
but don't abandon all hope: we're here. And we're here for YOU. We have
since our last post received some, like, undeniably great submissions.

Please!: had trouble finding the understanding editors? good alive fun
venues? Cheesed off at the impersonal rejection slip? the unfriendly
mega-rejection?  Well, then: send US your work.

Last issue: Araki Yasusada (yes, we know he's an hoax -- that's, like, the
_point_), Bill Knott, David Cameron, Denise Duhamel, Campbell McGrath,
Catherine Bowman, Dan Morris, Pat Moran, Charles Webb, a great essay by
Mikhail Epstein, and two interviews with no cussing.

Next issue: Richard Kostelanetz, Mark Halliday, Caroline Knox, Brenda
Coultas, David Cameron, Bill Knott, and THERE'S STILL SOME ROOM LEFT.
Deadline for this next issue: April second.

Please submit print material only.  No email submissions: we get confused.

We're accepting submissions for, what, poetry, sudden fiction, essays, and
stuff that cannot be identified.

This might be the type of question where the answer is, "if you have to
ask, you'll never know," but what are some of the many ways one can go
about setting up a magazine? I'm talking about the material questions
here: How much does it cost? How cheaply can it be done? How do you handle
the printing? The distribution? The rejection notices? How do you choose a
name, for instance? Do you get institutional funding, or do you go it
alone? Etc...

Along these lines, I'm about halfway through Michael Cuddihy's memoir,
_Try Ironwood_, about his late lamented magazine. It's great, but
these questions have gone unasked in that book (I get the feeling he had
access to money besides the NEA grants -- not that he was living on easy
street given his illnesses, of course, but money didn't seem to be a
problem for the mag).

So Poetix folks: I know full well some of you HAVE your own mags
and have been dying since this thread has started to talk about them.
Here's your chance: Any how-to advice? Horror stories? Success stories?
etc etc.

Tosh and other interested parties,

With the company I used to work for, we used Bookcrafters in, I think,
Michigan. You can find their ads in any writing type magazine. I think
they are also listed in the resources section of Bookwire. We never had
any problems with them. They are at the higher end of the range in price
from what I remember, but the knowledge that the job is going to be done
on time and right probably makes the extra $$ worth it.

David,
I published four issues of a magazine called "Angry" about 8 or 9 years
ago. If you don't count the hours of free labor I put in, I broke even.
I did this by buying a second-hand copy machine so I had control of the
means of production. My print runs could be whatever size I wanted. My
subscription policy was that I sent it out to 200 friends, relatives,
acquaintances, etc. and asked them to send me $4 for the issue if they
liked it. Every issue, about 10% of my "subscribers" sent me money,
sometimes more than I asked for. It was time that did me in.

I'm sure my enthusiasm for this list will ebb and fade. Nonetheless my
challenge was serious .  I truly believe that all writers should edit and
publish a magazine at some point in their career. And  that the magazine
should be as focused and considered as possible--it should be the evidence of
the need that brought it forth. Magazines, reading series, talks and the like
are the foundation blocks of the larger social project that a writing practice
is--we all need to take responsibility for keeping these kinds of scenes
renewed and alive. Doing a mag will teach you things you can't learn any other
way.Why not do what you can do, start what you can start sooner rather than
later?  If you think the "old guys" are getting all the attention then develop
a context to attend to the work of that special thirty something, or neglected
whomever. Only connect.  I'll stop here.  I'm starting to irritate myself.

I don't think it does, at least in the context of Pound's ABC of Reading --
I was merely trying to answer Jeremy's query by pointing out that the verb
"dichten" does not mean "to condense" but to "seal a gap" or "to plug the
leaks" in something, at least in contemporary German. Also, the words
"dichten" and "Dichtung" indeed seem etymologically unrelated.

I just thought that the idea of poetry as an act of "sealing" in this sense
(which is clearly not what Pound meant in the aforementioned quote) adds an
ironic, albeit retrospective, twist to Pound's poetic project and his
commitment to poetry as a craft, and eventually as a means of redeeming
culture and history. Now I concur that any such speculation -- based as it
is on Pound's third-hand knowledge of German and my second-hand knowledge
of ABC of Reading -- is ultimately sterile and self-undermining. My
apologies to those of you who took my comments seriously.

Just a reminder that Comprepoetica is still in business.  At
Comprepoetica those of you interested in individual poets (and one
critic) can read brief biographies of more than forty of them, many on
this list.  I hope eventually to have the equivalent of a magazine issue
devoted to each of Comprepoetica author: bio, selection of poems,
critical discussion--but the site doesn't seem to be generating much
interest.  All I need is data for bios, and/or sample poems and/or a
discussions of a poet's work by the poet or someone else.  So send me

To follow up on Michel Delville's post:

>I was merely trying to answer Jeremy's query by pointing out that the verb

But in fact 'dichten' does have the meaning 'tighten, thicken' and by
extension it does mean 'condensare.' Somebody cited the form 'verdichten'
already: this verb means 'to compress, condense.'  That is, quite
literally, 'dichten' by extension: ver + dichten. Also, if you look at
Kluge's _Etymologisches  Woerterbuch der Deutschen Sprache_, the article on
'dichten' will show the historical dvelopment of this word, which is
transparently related to English 'thicken, tighten.'

At some point [Kluge cites the 9th century] there is evidence of borrowing
of the Latin verb 'dictare' to dictate, compose, poetry [again, Horace:
dictare carmina]. And the two separate verbs, with exact same phonetic
shape but quite different meaning, begin to influence each other.

In fact, besides, 'Dichtung' [poem], there is also a second form,
'Dichtung' [sealing, packing].

The point is that Pound, with his poetic ear, picked up on this semantic
association and played with it, rather perceptively I think, even if not
fully aware of the history of these words.

A couple of years ago I destroyed most of my writing(the bulk of what
constituted 15 and more years of work).  Stupid?  Perhaps.  A practice
suicide?  Maybe.  I was at the end of my tether, rabid with self-directed
loathing.  I'd convinced myself that I remained the failing little boy of yore
and that time was running out.  It's still sometimes hard not to feel this way
although I'm learning tricks to turn around these patterns of negativity.

My larger point is that this act of destruction was a sad necessity in terms
of clearing the deck.  All those MSS (slaved over, patronized, rejected,
vilified) were like a noose around my neck.  Cutting them away reawakened in
me a dormant sense of just how enormous a responsibility is the practice of
writing.  I resolved to begin again, perhaps fail again; but, like Uncle Sam,
to "fail better".

The list has revolutionary potential insofar as we spin off from it and do the
hard work in the big and nasty outside world.  I wasn't an English major. I
live in a college town but am not an academic.  I do Public Health work in
which I am constantly up against many of life's harder realities.  Much as I
love theorizing I think the real point of all art is change.  Multidimensional
change.

Do something--a mag or reading series, talks (whatever you can do to expand
the appetite for radical thought).  Make the list an epicenter.  Become a
retrovirus.  Infect the body politic.

Yo, Hilton,

While poets have been using libraries and coffee houses in which to write
for centuries, I do believe it may have been the late Dan Davidson who was
the first to employ the department store for this purpose. Dan would go to
Nordstrom in San Francisco, find a place to sit and work. He claimed that he
enjoyed the ambience of the live piano.

A few weeks ago (it seems) Loss Glazier proposed to the graduate students
"here" in Buffalo (this messsage delivered to my time zone via the glory
of telnet) that it might be a productive addition to one's graduate work
to do the requisite labor involved for the creation of EPC author pages
where many of the poets one might want to see represented are not (mostly
women). His list was about two times as long as Ron's and probably not
everyone on it is in line for such a collection of critical appreciation.
This electronic space makes for a different set of possibilities. I would
recommend that where once Talisman did a S.H. issue, or an Alice Notley
Issue (and I really can't believe that for some of the writers listed
below there aren't qualifying feschrifts, but that just goes to show i
guess...) NOW we might think of clustering critial interests around
volunteeristic/careeristic editors who would do the labor of assembling
the texts. As Loss pointed out (here/there) the actual markup for this
activity would be relatively easy and done at the EPC home office, so no
real html experience would be required. Joseph Conte did something of a
similar service when he sent out requests for Dictionary of Literary
Biography entries on contemporary poets. It seems that the EPC equivalent
could be simple sites providing a similar function.anyhow-that's my 2sense

David,

I'm interested in e-publications as a means to distribute quickly and
broadly the work of contempos. Many university servers offer
students/faculty a significant amount of free server space with their
accounts and most pay-servers do the same. Usually something in the
'hood of five mb's. This is enough space to do at least a years worth of
text-only pubs, and if you use netscape communicator you don't even have
to know how to write html to publish a zine. So, it' very cheap, very
easy and very quick - I spent less than 10 hours designing, finishing
and distributing the first issue. One click to the poetics list and you
have a distribution of nearly six hundred interested readers.

I'd be interested also to hear other's thoughts on e-publiation.
Especially regarding publication or "previously published" status of
texts as regards print mag editing as well as reading poetry on line,
printing out e-pubs etc. Are people likely to read on-line or to print
them out and read them on paper? How do "materialists" feel about such a
disembodied space for poetry?

Truly,

Mike

your words are inspiring. i know i don't have the energy to do a mag by
myself, and barely the energy to do speakers, but there are other ways of
participating which i do.  i'm grateful for your voice on the list.  as for
destroying one's work, i've done that too, and you're right: even though in
the long run the work outlives the person, in the larger metaphysical world
i think, if one *can* make the choice, it's okay to choose one's life over
one's work.

Joel, could you tell us a little more about Joseph Conte's Dictionary of
Literary Biography entries on contemporary poets?  I don't remember

I'll second that emotion. Recently they gave me an estimate that was 10%
below McNaughton & Gunn, which I use. I had them send me samples--they were
awful (always ask for samples of the work of a printer who's new to you).
All printers have problems, make mistakes. M & G is as good as any
short-run company, and better than many. They screwed up the page back-up
on one of Junction's books. My standards are pretty high. They trashed the
whole print run and did it over at their expense. McNaughton & Gunn,
313-429-5411. Ask for Lori Potter, tell her I sent you--never hurts to
grease the wheels. Turn around, by the way, is 4-5 weeks.

I've been asked, on very short notice, to write a book review on a short
collection of poems (in English translation) by the Korean poet Ko Un.

The introductory material and translator's notes have a lot to say about
his life and Zen practice, but very little about how his work fits into
contemporary Korean poetry, or what the range of contemporary Korean
poetics is.  Ko Un himself states his poetics, but they seem much more
revolutionary than his poems as they appear in translation.  Only 108 (a
significant Buddhist number) poems appear in the collection, but he is
apparently much more prolific than that, and I have no idea how typical
these poems are of his work.

If anyone can help me fill in some of the gaps mentioned in the above
paragraph I will be very grateful.

Unfortunately, the review is due in a few days.

Thanks.

   Backchannel me, thanks.....
2. Does anybody have access to the WEB and could print out some of
   John Tranter's magazine published in the form of a web-site....
   I am particularly looking for the HANS MAGNUS ENZENSBERGER poem
    he announced was to be published there. Since I do not have
    web access, and even if i did, cannot download and print off
    my email (and i cannot read POEMS on computer screen in a way
    that does them justice), I would
DEEPLY appreciate the assistance of anybody
    who could do this for me (will send you my book or something
    as payment). Thanks, in advance....

Rob,

There's often a blur between the coffee house, the department store, and
the mall, such as at the Nordstrom's at Stonestown in SF, and with the
piano there's a certain dreamy ambience that's melancholy, soothing,
filled with muffled anxiety (the appropriate state of commodity exchange
alpha brain, I suppose) that I found conducive to writing, even when I had
commercial jobs, so I can appreciate what Dan Davidson enjoyed.
Other great places are airports, train stations.  Of course, there's
always hotel lobbies -- and if you get dressed up, bring a brief case, you
can sit for hours as if you're waiting for a meeting with no one bothering
you.

Pat Boran I think is talking about poets actually getting paid to hang
out at Nordstrom's -- an even more thrilling notion (if no strings
attached) -- an idea that might get implemented in "socialist" Britain or
Ireland.  Imagine having a little space in Boeing or the Chicago
commodities exchange or the Luxor in Las Vegas, some notebooks, a computer
-- hell, I could finally write a poem of micrwave electronics and
Boolean Algebra at Hewlet-Packard, and I'm running out to their personnel
department to offer my services right now!

Take care,

Hilton Obenzinger

Repeatedly, with this discussion of honoring & widening the path to
those who have done the work & made now possible, (whether were speaking
language, visual/verbal, or poetry poetry) the looming omission seems to
be that access to such authors is taken for granted.  I dont believe Im
the only person interested in meeting all of an author's lifework that
does not have access to libraries that carry this work, who cannot
afford to buy it, or who uses literature in less academic, more playful
ways.  My interest is less in marking critical recognition & or
canonizing our favorites.  What I am interested in is how, (for example)
David B's life & words enter my daily life, whether its feedings the
goats, planting trees, or teaching interns about permaculture.  My
belief is that in order for poetry to live it has to function
simultaneously with/ & as an essence of community.

For many communities such as Dreamtime Village, the web has made what
failed in the 60s possible in the 90s.  & my overriding critique of many
such sustainable communities then as now is that they are culturally
stale, that they are afraid to make the leaps that allow the exciting &
breathtaking culturework going on, that we in this list take for granted
as being something larger than us, when in many ways it really is a
phenomena of the personalities on this list.  If I wanted to turn a
newbie showing up at dreamtime onto the world of newlit, I would invite
them to take part in this list a long time before I would have them
tackle Louie's A. (Rest assured that in the end, after access to real
people was achieved, I would expand it to introducing them to books &
publishing & readings, etc.).

When I was coming of age in the late 70s I got excited about & addicted
to this very questionable lifestyle by Kostelanetz & Rothenberg
anthologies & by L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E mag, & even was so daring as to think
they would publish my writing & tho my submissions were repeated
rejected, I felt thru those pages that it was a circuit of ideas &
designs that somehow included me in a very personal way.  & meeting many
of those characters later on confirmed that indeed we shared similar
motivations & longterm goals even if our styles were very very
different.

Personally I'm nervous about people becoming too web-oriented.  There's value
in being able to read a mag in a coffee shop or on an exercycle or in the
bath.  And having only recently gotten wired I'm all too conscious of what it
is to be without the technology. I do prefer the material book or mag.  I
can't stick a desktop in my pocket.

I absolutely agree with all the lists of deserving subjects of critical
issues.  What I'd like to see  though is people coming forward with lists of
critical issues they are willing to start taking on. Everyone knows what
hasn't been done.  What are all of us willing to do?

I detect a strategy here, & would like to know more.  Are you saying
that the same archives that collect small press & bookart are also
interested in a hardcopy version of webworks?  How are they being
catalogued?  Are you binding actual volumes or are you handing them
looseleaf xeroxes.  Do you think such works get treated equal to
published volumes or is it treated as ephemera, like say an author's
letters?

When I compare how many hits we get on various sites to how many people
have read a Xexoxial book, I have to console myself that ehy are really
2 different mediums.  There is of course the question of how many of
those "hits" actually consume content.

I think the days of poets being supported by a critical & publishing
that is separate from their own life's work have largely come to pass.
Of the 100s of writers/artists Im in contact with, I really dont know
one that isnt participant in at least some of the other furniture of
creating poetic culture, whether it be publishing, distributing,
bookstores, working in archives & libraries, radio, reading series,
collaborations, teaching & promotion.

You know, I invited David to come show me his goat milking tricks for
just that reason.

ok. it is like 70 degrees here and I'm sitting in a coffee shop and there
are birds flying over head, swooping down on the crumbs scattered
throughout. i don't mean to be an "advocate" for the biggest real estate
boom since (pick colonial expansion of your choice). I certainly don't
think that the web is going to replace anything. on the other hand, with
the publishing racket the way it is, I don't see how there is any choice.
Use it while it is free. And while I used to complain about questions of
access, etc., Miekal And has pretty much demonstrated that the web offers
more than may be immeidately clear. The biggest expense I encounter as a
publisher is MAILING COSTS. I recently packaged up a package for Steve
Evans and Jen Moxley who are now in France. It was going to cost me about
ten dollars to send it over the slow boat to france. It had about 5
chapbooks and a tape of her reading in buffalo last spring. The same with
Manuel Brito, who I wanted to send a similar mp luv pak, as he will often
do the same for me. I asked the people at the USPS for the cheapest rate
and it was still out of my range. I have to wait until after my trip to
california as I just couldn't do it. In U.S. there is 4thclass bookrate
which is never a sure-thing even while I accept that it will be slow.

Bill Gates just gave half-a-mill to the Buffalo public libraries , to put
internet-ready computers in every branch in poor neighborhoods. What we
can do is develop our own sites as facilities of community outreach. Most
academics are also teachers and most poets are closet missionaries, so the
impetus to go out and develop a means of helping kids write the most
bareass minimum of code (or develop templates which eliminate the need for
extensive rewriting each time) kills off the computer access problem.
Also--Taylor Brady at the Small pRess Collective in buffalo has promised
that the first issue of SPC will be available as a PDF file, which means
that "formatted texts" such as mags, etc., don't have to be read on line,
they can be printed and taken outside into the glare of sunshine, read
while fishing on the pier, etc. For the past two semesters I have
experimented with teaching skeletal html to my freshman comp students.
WEhen I first started teaching comp, I did a similar thing with e-mail and
there was initial resistance then (about 5 years ago). Now, kids come into
class with the most outrageous internet handles and as veterans of their
own flame wars. Many of them have web pages and as a teacher I encourage
them to develop their sites as extensions of their own writing (and I
think it was Lyn Hejinian who once wrote that small press publishing was
an "extension of one's own writing") to some degree of success. Therefore,
I think we have a certain degree of responsibility to make our work
available to that group of readers (read target audience). I was living in
San Francisco during one of the great poetry wars there and had no idea
what was going on, so physical proximity to events means nothing.

The Dictionary of Literary Biography is a giant reference book series
published by Gale (I think) in Detroit. Joseph C's editing of that now two
volume update of the contempoary author series has been going on for three
or four years and is nearing completion.Are you out there Joe?  But that
is a library reference tool being created there, not a public web
document. My points in bringing it up was to show one model for editorial
activity: collecting and organizing the material from a variety of
writer-sources. A web editor could be much the same thing. The essays in
the DLB are generally definitive overviews of the poet's career as a
writer, book by book. Take a look at it if you have a Univ. Library near
you... (and that's the point)

I do share Tom's nervousness about people becoming too web oriented. As
far as Miekal's recognition that "hits" do not constitute "consumption of
content" (I forget his exact phrase) the same could be said for all the
glossy journals piling up in attics across the land...at least mainstream
books are pulped at the end of the tax year, remaindered for change. On
the other hand, part of the intervention offered by web-stuffs can be the
reminder to "go outside" (which is a problem that most libraries have).
Sometimes when I'm walking around I realize that I can't even read a book
outdoors. It's like, er, "look up!"

        Tom, Mike, others: I love the word "e-publiation" above--it sort of
captures "not quite publication" for me, which is one of the problems.
Granted the times are transitional, but Journals, etc. still insist on work
not previously published, while the centers of power like grant agencies or
tenure review  boards don't count cyber as pub. So it's a situation where
one might shoot oneself in both feet with one shot, isn't it? Clearly, this
will change rapidly, as publication  (paper publication) costs continue to
rise & the websites become differentiated. I tend to not get around to
sending work to net mags, for some reason. For visual or hypertext,
obviously, things would be very different.
        But that's all one problem, & not really mine. I publish a series
of broadsides, generally the work of one writer at a time. They are on good
paper, photo-offset, but then I spend a huge amount of time hand-stamping a
colophon, and hand-numbering. Why? Not to get theoretical-- or repeat
William Morris & Co.--because it adds something. People respond to them
differently. They save them. They reread them. Maybe that's antithetical to
certain purposes, to Fluxus, for example, but I don't care. If I had more
character, I might do them in handset type, though I would lose much. I've
found a compromise that works for me, for now. The net, in my brief
experience, fosters a skim&delete mentality, and that's not what I turn to
poetry for.
        If anyone wants a sample, I'll send the two latest, #32 Nathaniel
Tarn/Some Smalls & Dogs Dreaming, and #33 Jerome Rothenberg/At the Grave of
Nakahara Chuya. Or you couold subscribe for a year, 8 issues, for $10. Next
two, going to press Monday, are by Kathleen Fraser & Kusaya Eiichi (trans.
D.W. Wright).
        Although you couldn't guess from these names, I also publish
unknowns. I like Tom Beckett's call, and suggest the postcard-poem form for
anyone--you can photocopy on card-stock pretty inexpensively.

while we're on this subject -- if a library near you has them, it would be
worth your while to look at the old issues of Vort, edited many years ago
by Barry Alpert -- special issues on Bromige, Irby, Kelly, Dorn etc --
didn't last long (and always asked the same question in the interview
segment) -- but was a strong model for much that has come after

Yes. I asked because a number of the authors I plan to publish have
asked me the question: does e-publication count? I think and hope the
answer to be becoming "yes."

The possibilities for poetic dissemination on the Web are incredible -
that one can mail to 600 or more potential readers in an instant speaks
well for the future of poetry publication - and it would seem as the
goal of publication (I think) should be to both give (as in a gift)
poetry to an audience and to give (as in a gift) an audience to the
poet(ry), that web publication can (potentially) accomplish this end at
least as well as print.

(Though, as Laura and others have stated, archiving too is important.
E-chiving is in fact happening at the epc, where Loss frequently copies
entire sites for the e-chive.)

Further digression: it seems to me in light of what I just said, and in
light of the fact that I read too much Marshall McLuhan last fall, that
the status of poetry as a genre is (at least potentially) enriched by
e-publication in that e-published poetry as medium is neither literal
nor oral nor print, yet it shares aspects of all three in that it is
alphabetic/visual (literal), performative/ephemeral (oral), and can be
converted into visico-material format (print). A poetic hat trick, as it
were.

Finally, as to e-po's ability to subvert authority, imagine: e-zines by
the billions jamming the mailboxes of administrative assistants,
receptionists, mailroom operators, everyone up the chain of corporate
being reading poetry on the job instead of working!

Poetry readers of the world, unite!

I'll go with everybody else on this, I guess. It was about five years ago
that I last dealt with Bookcrafters. Maybe we just got lucky. But
definitely ask for samples and for the names of other customers.

Ways of getting the word, the work "out there."  Thanks to TomB for adding
several new vectors to the group recently.  Tom, perhaps I should
backchannel this, but actually I think it relates to the recent threads
about finding venues, etc.

Years ago, back in the 80s, I was in an Intro to Poetry course at Kent
State, taught by a wonderful prof, Jacob Leed--he took us to the Kent
State Library Rare Book room, back issues of Black Mountain Review,
fantastic stuff--it wasn't until I left Kent that I realized what a
treasure that was --I though all University libraries had such
collections.

Anyway, Leed brought a local poet to class one day, mainly I suspect
because he was interested--Tom Beckett.  We, undergrads all,
probably didn't appreciate the poetry, didn't "get it," but we were
exposed, as we were in the library and in the better ourses, to work we
didn't understand.  If we understood it going in, after all, what would
the point be?

So, Tom, a belated hey, thanks! and to all, even if you aren't in
academia, there may be opportunities to reach into the classroom. . .the
Internet is clearly one of these ways.  In my Junior-level Humanities
class, I had the students put there final projects online.  It didn't work
out as well as had hoped, but when I got my student comments this
semester, several students remarked that learning to use the Internet was
a valuable part of the course.  I thought it had failed, we spent too much
time learning the basics, but it seems it was useful.

Meikal:

There's a McCaff issue of _Open Letter_ but it's pretty dated: fall 1987
(ouch, the year I graduated high school). It includes the only
checklist/biblio of Steve's work that I know of (compiled by bpNichol).

Essex Studios and Tailspin Press are producing a catalogue of Steve's vispo
(most of it never published) to commemorate his first ever performance of
Carnival:Panel 2, which happened at Cornershop in Buffalo on Oct. 25, 1997.


Open Letter is available from Frank Davey (fdavey@julian.uwo.ca).

The catalogue when it's done can be ordered from Bill Howe
(howe@acsu.buffalo.edu) or me (spound@interlog.com)
