Also, The Economist this week lists Susan Howe's

Isn't that amazing?

Dear Anyone,

  I may be in Chicago May 31-June 3. I''ve never been there and I'm thinking
of going with my husband to the BEA. (He's in the book biz.) Anyway, I wonder
if anyone knows of a place I might read in the area. (Money would be nice, as
always, but isn't necessarily essential.) My new Geen Integer book may
possibly be out by then.
Please backchannel. Since I've never been there, I also welcome suggestions
about what to do, where to eat, etc.

Thanks,

  Rae Armantrout (the reviser)

Subject:      THE ZINC BAR PRESENTS APRIL: NATIONAL NATIONAL AWARENESS MONTH
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

No one, not even THE ZINC BAR SUNDAY NIGHT READING SERIES, is immune to the
fact that National Poetry Month is upon us once again.   A fact that
guarantees a bit more April-is-the-estest-month coverage of some avenues of
poetry & suggests that poetry is something we ought to be more aware
of...not so much for the pleasure of it, but, as with tsunamis or STD's,
out of a sort of self-defense.  Be it to better prepare yourself against
the threat of Poetry, or because you rather dig the spectre of verse, we
hope you can make it to the Zinc Bar.

So that poetry wouldn't overshadow the other important issues facing our
nation this month, we briefly considered having our readers speak only on
the array of National Months that April also is, namely:  National Autism
Awareness Month, Alcohol Awareness, Mathematics, Military Appreciation, STD
Awareness, Alopecia Areata Awareness, Fair Housing, Youth Sports Safety,
Savings, Volunteer, Childcare, Tsunami Awareness, Community College,
Occupational Therapy & Soy Foods Awareness.

But then we reconsidered.

We can't tell you what they'll read, other than that it'll be terrific.
But we can tell you who they'll be:

SUNDAY APRIL 2: MICHAEL FRIEDMAN + GARY KEENAN
SUNDAY APRIL 9: GRIFFIN HANSBURY + MERRY FORTUNE
SUNDAY APRIL 16: JENA OSMAN + mysterious guest
TUESDAY APRIL 25: SUZAN SHERMAN + SUKI KIM
SUNDAY APRIL 30: JOE ELIOT + DAVID CAMERON

Brendan Lorber & Douglas Rothschild are your hosts.

All the readings begin at 6:37pm on Sunday night, with the occasional
Tuesday thrown in to make sure yr paying attention.  Remember that we
spring forward on April 1!

They'll run you a cool $3, which goes right on over to the readers, no
questions asked.  Books are always available, so bring a little extra.

Zinc Bar is downstairs, bred out of the dead land at 90 West Houston Street
betw. Laguardia & Thompson.  For more information call Douglas at
212.366.2091 or Brendan at 212.533.9317 or lungfull@interport.net

On behalf of Douglas Rothschild & everyone at Zinc Bar,
I remain steadfast & unswervingly,
Brendan Lorber

PS: If you'd like to see a report on ISSUE ZERO: THE MAGAZINE CONFERENCE IN
NEW YORK CITY, which Douglas & I are still merrily recovering from, go on
over to http://www.poetryproject.com/ishzero.html.  Over 30 journals & 150
audience members assembled at The St. Mark's Poetry Project, Zinc Bar &
Double Happiness, to discuss what they're up to.  This is what they said.

It wouldn't be a bad idea for students to read something about pidgins and
creoles. There is a rather short book by Loreto Todd, named precisely
Pidgins and Creoles (Routledge 1974).

You mentioned poetry written in idiolects. That means ALL POETRY since
everyone speaks an idiolect.

Thanks to all who replied front & backch on this...

Tom: they don't *have* to be feminist critiques it's just what I'm
specifically interested in, for a specific project at the moment.

Maria, thanks much for your reply! 'Dorky scholarly question' was meant to
convey my awareness of the problem you mention re: requesting the
'groundbreaking' texts. That is, that it's both dorky and scholarly to
believe in such things. Time pressures, as ever, make it necessary sometimes
to lean on such formations temporarily -- & I'm in a terrible crunch right
now... it would have been clearer for me to say I'm trying to get an idea of
what folks THINK are the groundbreaking texts: itself a formation far from
unexaminable ---

Thanks to Ron & Damion for a couple of really lovely posts.

Ron:

yes, I think you're absolutely right about process, and it's one of the
things that rather puzzled me about the Gardner & Kerouac, just that these
guys really are thinking to prescribe to ... everyone? what the process of
writing is, should be, must be.

(Where Jacques writes

>Would
>it be very unfair to see Ron Silliman here as naturalizing the code of
>artistic representation  in which works like Rae Armantrout's and his own
>written?

I don't understand what the word "naturalizing" is supposed to mean here,
but for the rest I assume the answer is "of course", and that writers have
always theorized afterwards what they find in their practice. it's nothing
new and it's probably the way things ought to be. I can't imagine why
Jacques finds this -- does he? -- scandalous somehow.)

I wonder if you could say a little more about your claustrophobia. You've
really helped me out here. Revision to what effect? that's a great
recasting of my question, and it hits really close to home: When I was a
young man, Joyce was It, and I thought of writing for a long long time as
aspiring to perfection. That's why Kerouac's dogmatic (literally) rejection
of that ideal appeals to me despite my doubts, and at any rate I can see
how salutary even necessary it may have been to hear someone of
demonstrable talent say this in the early 50s.

So ... claustrophobia. That suggests being trapped inside the work and what
you look for is work that leaves some openings to ---? Should we say "the
world"? Maybe to more work, just giving up the idea of the final &
definitive statement. ---- Anyway, if you have more thoughts on this or
would like to connect it to anything else, I'd like to hear it.

****

Damion:

Don't write less, write more. I'll read it.

The power & glory of revision. I remember reading about Lawrence, I guess
he did a fair amount of tinkering with what he'd written but he'd also just
start all over and write the whole novel again from scratch, or at least go
until he was dissatisfied and break off & then start again. There are
partial or complete drafts of like 8 versions of Lady Chatterly I think.
That always had a truly heroic ring to it for me. And curiously it's *
rewriting* rather than *revising* and as rewriting it's in fact much closer
to what Kerouac says is the model. Parker played the same tunes over & over
again night after night. Then in the studio there are false starts, and
often complete takes from which the master is selected, or in some cases
the master is put together from several takes. (There's the time Monk came
into the studio one Friday the 13th with a band that included young Sonny
Rollins, and he had a composition so difficult they never got a complete
take but had to patch one together.)

The Graham Greene quote is nice, and your reaction is exactly on target.
It's as if  how you handle these issues determines whether you're a *real*
writer. I think that's definitely what Gardner & Kerouac are both saying,
only they give different tests. And their tests would clearly flunk each
other. Now you could have a Kerouacian version of the Greene idea: force
yourself to crank it out whether you feel like it or not! So I could almost
see going with GG here without tying it to any *particular* conception of
the process, but only to the idea of devotion to the process whatever it is
and *keeping it going*. And speaking from personal experience, rigid ideas
about what the process *should* be can keep it from starting at all. Then
you're a writer who doesn't write. Ick.

Hi Jacques-- I appreciate your letter but have to say that I have thought
long and hard about these things, have not been as immersed in the jargon as
some folks, having chosen midway thru a liberal arts college and a big
university to chuck the english dept for the native amer studies, wherein i
did plenty of lit crit in a slightly, slightly other discourse (of course we
were all in academia). then yes i have been concentrating on "creative"
(ugh) writing since. But I wonder if it's _my_ jargon and attitude
(slapstick, both?) that bug you rather than my ideas. I do not simply want
to change the canon to include more women, although I would not agree that
that change is merely about who is invited, so to speak; I think it is also
about ideas, and which get considered.

I agree that it would be totally weird to say that women don't do theory. I
can't imagine that I ever said that. For one thing, my dearest friend (a
gal) just finished a big fat dissertation. (And for a school that DERRIDA
hangs out at)


Cheers, ET

ps as i really want to go into list retirement now, i send this as my "final
answer". did i win?

COMP.BASILISK FAQ=20

DAVID LANGFORD=20


Frequently asked questions about basilisks.=20


1. What is the purpose of this newsgroup?
To provide a forum for discussion of basilisk (BLIT) images. Newsnet readers=
=20
who prefer low traffic should read comp.basilisk.moderated, which carries=20
only high-priority warnings and identifications of new forms. =20
=20

2. Can I post binary files here?
If you are capable of asking this question you MUST immediately read=20
news.announce.newusers, where regular postings warn that binary and=20
especially image files may emphatically not be posted to any newsgroup. Many=
=20
countries impose a mandatory death penalty for such action.

3. Where does the acronym BLIT come from?
The late unlamented Dr Vernon Berryman's system of maths-to-visual algorithm=
s=20
is known as the Berryman Logical Imaging Technique. This reflected the=20
original paper's title: "On Thinkable Forms, with Notes towards a Logical=20
Imaging Technique" (V. Berryman & K. Turner, Nature 409, 340=96342; 2001).=20
Inevitably, the paper has since been suppressed and classified to a high=20
level.

4. Is it true that science-fiction authors predicted basilisks?
Yes and no. The idea of unthinkable information that cracks the mind has a=20
long SF pedigree, but no one got it quite right. William Gibson's Neuromance=
r=20
(1984), the novel that popularized cyberspace, is often cited for its concep=
t=20
of 'black ice' software which strikes back at the minds of hackers =97 but t=
his=20
assumes direct neural connection to the net. Basilisks are far more deadly=20
because they require no physical contact.

Much earlier, Fred Hoyle's The Black Cloud (1957) suggested that a download=20
of knowledge provided by a would-be-helpful alien (who has superhuman mental=
=20
capacity) could overload and burn out human minds.

A remarkable near-miss features in The Shapes of Sleep (1962) by J. B.=20
Priestley, which imagines archetypal shapes that compulsively evoke=20
particular emotions, intended for use in advertising.

Piers Anthony's Macroscope (1969) described the 'Destroyer sequence', a=20
purposeful sequence of images used to safeguard the privacy of galactic=20
communications by erasing the minds of eavesdroppers.

The comp.basilisk community does not want ever again to see another posting=20
about the hoary coincidence that Macroscope appeared in the same year and=20
month as the first episode of the British TV programme Monty Python's Flying=
=20
Circus, with its famous sketch about the World's Funniest Joke that causes=20
all hearers to laugh themselves to death.

5. How does a basilisk operate?
The short answer is: we mustn't say. Detailed information is classified=20
beyond Top Secret.

The longer answer is based on a popular-science article by Berryman (New=20
Scientist, 2001), which outlines his thinking. He imagined the human mind as=
=20
a formal, deterministic computational system =97 a system that, as predicted=
 by=20
a variant of G=F6del's Theorem in mathematics, can be crashed by thoughts th=
at=20
the mind is physically or logically incapable of thinking. The Logical=20
Imaging Technique presents such a thought in purely visual form as a basilis=
k=20
image which our optic nerves can't help but accept. The result is disastrous=
,=20
like a software stealth-virus smuggled into the brain.

6. Why 'basilisk'?
It's the name of a mythical creature: a reptile whose mere gaze can turn=20
people to stone. According to ancient myth, a basilisk can be safely viewed=20
in a mirror. This is not generally true of the modern version =97 although s=
ome=20
highly asymmetric basilisks like B-756 are lethal only in unreflected or=20
reflected form, depending on the dominant hemisphere of the victim's brain.

7. Is it just an urban legend that the first basilisk destroyed its creator?
Almost everything about the incident at the Cambridge IV supercomputer=20
facility where Berryman conducted his last experiments has been suppressed=20
and classified as highly undesirable knowledge. It's generally believed that=
=20
Berryman and most of the facility staff died.

Subsequently, copies of basilisk B-1 leaked out. This image is famously know=
n=20
as the Parrot for its shape when blurred enough to allow safe viewing. B-1=20
remains the favourite choice of urban terrorists who use aerosols and=20
stencils to spray basilisk images on walls by night.

But others were at work on Berryman's speculations. B-2 was soon generated a=
t=20
the Lawrence Livermore Laboratory and, disastrously, B-3 at MIT.

8. Are there basilisks in the Mandelbrot set fractal?
Yes. There are two known families, at symmetrical positions, visible under=20
extreme magnification. No, we're not telling you where.

9. How can I get permission to display images on my website?
This is a news.announce.newusers question, but keeps cropping up here. In=20
brief: you can't, without a rarely granted government licence. Using anythin=
g=20
other than plain ASCII text on websites or in e-mail is a guaranteed way of=20
terminating your net account. We're all nostalgic about the old, colourful=20
web, and about television, but today's risks are simply too great.

10. Is it true that Microsoft uses basilisk booby-traps to protect Windows=20
2005 from disassembly and pirating?
We could not possibly comment.

Brian,

I think there's a lot of overlap between your experience and mine and, I
would wager, many other poets in our age-and-aesthetic-affiliation cohort:
that is, having been influenced heavily early on by the poets in various
anthologies like the Oscar Williams collection, or Mark Strand's
_Contemporary American Poets_, or even _A Geography of Poets_ (editor ...
Fields?).  In my case, growing up in Modesto, CA, in the arid Central
Valley, I discovered these poets before most of the Black Mountain, Beat,
NYS, or Language poetry that was available at the time, so I relied on them
for whatever mind-tweaking value they had.  Hecht's poems in those books
made an impact on me with their formal elegance, too, as did for that matter
Wilbur, Lowell, Berryman, Jarrell (oh yeah, _totally_ Jarrell), Justice,
etc.  These poets went some way toward satisfying a thirst for a certain
kind of sonic zing, above all else; their ability to fuse registers from
different historical phases, for example, approached a state that would have
qualified as "postmodern" if it had been a little less harumphy in ways that
suggested the fusion meant something almost religious to them as opposed to
the more potential, unhinged meaning it had for me in that unschooled stage
of my readership.  It was Ashbery who really followed through on that
promise, though.  That's why when I do go back to Hecht, et al., they don't
seem as weird as they used to, and I don't get as much out of them anymore.
Except maybe Jarrell.

There are poets, however, that I do like to confess to liking partly for the
same sort of shock value that you mention: Philip Larkin, who is just so
detestable that I can't help being fascinated, especially when his prosody
is so damned buttery-smooth; James Tate, who seems like a musician with an
instrument he will never fully understand, and who insists on playing long
sentimental passages with it, but who can also make noises on it no one else
can; Richard Hugo, whose long congested lines gurgle along like a drunken,
elegaic old choo-choo train; Ron Koertge, Pasadena freak-out sex-fiend
confessional racetrack-addict poet.

Also, I tried to write like Lawrence Ferlinghetti for a while in the early
eighties.

Hope this is interesting to anyone besides myself.

Kasey

Brian,

try

Hutcheon, Linda. "Incredulity toward Metanarrative: Negotiating
Postmodernism and Feminisms", Tessera. 1989 Fall, 7, 39-44.

which is also found in-

Collaboration in the Feminine: Writings on Women and Culture from Tessera.
       Toronto : Second Story, 1994.

edited (i think) by Barbara Godard. This collection helped me figure some
of this stuff out and the writing is amazing. Another, yet connected,
writer who may help you in terms of a poetics is NIcole Brossard. Her book
_The Aeriel Letter_ is an excellent example of writing that slips between
the slash of theory/theatre. Also, for me it one of the most producerly
texts i have ever read. keep a pen handy because once you start reading
you won't want to stop writing.

finally, quite some time ago someone referred me to the following to help
me surf the waves of contemporary feminist thinking. i'd be interested to
hear comments from some of you out there who know a lot more about this
stuff than me. Is this an accurate state of affairs?

"Let us turn to the work of Julian Kristeva. In her famous essay "Women's
time" Kristeva writes that feminism has developed in three broad
stages: the first stage is that in which women demand equal access to the
patriarchal, symbolic order, desiring equality rather than
subjugation. The problem with this approach is that women are seen as no
different than men; women are 'to become men.'  This approach leads to a
complete surrender to patriarchy and its values. It assumes that women
must replace being defined by the phallus with her identification
with(italicized) the phallus.

The second type of feminism is that in which women reject the male
symbolic order in the name of difference, resulting in radical feminism
(for example,the work of Iragary). Femininity is not only celebrated by
radical femininism but also seen as better and essentially different.

The third kind of feminism is that in which women reject the dichotomy
between masculine and feminine as metaphysical and aim at transcendance of
the catagories of sexual difference - or at least recognition of their
cultural construction. In this stage scholars analyze the symbolic
systems through which we communicate and organise our lives so as to
understand how it is that we learn to be what our culture calls 'woman' as
against what are called 'men'.

Hi Maria, point taken. Tho I didn't mean it in "real life" I more meant to
point to the fact that the critical writing I like to read is beautiful in
itself. Cheers, ET
ps and thanks for your disembodiment post.

      Charles Bernstein. The book is priced at $14.95 (376 pages).

      The new issue of PUBLISHERS WEEKLY contains a starred
      review (representing a book of "outstanding quality.")

      *At once the most paradoxically controversial and popular,
      accessible and most difficult of the L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E
      poets, Bernstein is also the writer of that group who strove early
      on to experiment with the extremes of its newly minted methods.
      Whether highlighting the synaesthesis of the word in its isolation
      or in the plain phrase as it operates in daily life to convey our
      most
      banal thoughts, this collection of long out-of-print chapbooks--none
      of these poems has appeared in any of Bernstein's many break-
      through volumes, such as ISLETS/IRRITATIONS (1993) or DARK
      CITY (1994)--provides a unique overview of his career, and adds
      to the range of his impressive canon of major and minor works. The
      first poem from the 1976 volume PARSING titled "Sentences," will
      surprise anyone expecting text-over-speech, as it is practically
      a litany of anxieties, attitudes and stuttering intensities. This
      attention to spoken language makes such dense works as "Poem"
      (from 1978's SHADE) both welcoming and discomforting, ex-
      pressionistically cinematic but not without its moments of eye-wink
      satiric narrative. In the short poems collected in THE ABSENT
      FATHER IN "DUMBO" and RESIDUAL RUBBERNECKING,=20
      Bernstein takes the project far from the austere fragments of the
      early works and deep into a purposely "purple" and unbeautiful
      lyricism: "Such mortal slurp to strain this sprawl went droopy/
      Gadzooks it seems would bend these slopes in girth/None trailing
      failed to hear the ship looks loopey/Who's seen it nailed uptight
      right at its berth." Bernstein always manages to find the furthest
      reaches of any norms of "good taste" (be it mainstream or avant-
      garde), creating a poetics that reveals the social codes hiding
      behind all the poetry's tropes and forms. Though many of the
      latter poems here seem unfocused and minor compared to the
      fabulous and ambitious early chapbooks, the volume as a whole
      presents as many promises as it does relevant problems, as
      many beauties as it does strange new imaginings.

there's a wonderful poem by christopher dewdney that is nothing but a
successive stringing-together of cliche upon cliche, i think it's called
"parasite" from _alter sublime_?

not quite what you were asking but worth checking out.

First, I am brand spankin' new to the list.  So let me say how much
I've enjoyed reading the archives.  I love crackpots and poets ( I am
one of each.).  I wonder how many of your think the term "avant garde"
still useful.  I prefer "experimental."  Why?  So glad you asked.
It seems to me that however interesting and valuable the sort of work
we do is--whether language centered (Mac Low doesn't find that term
very meaningful, since all poetry is language centered.) or lyrical,
most if not all of the rules we play by are well established.  Is
there anything out and about that we comprehend as actually ahead of
its time?  If so, who and where?  Come back.

______________
The full story: http://www.cortlandreview.com/features/00/04/rigsbee.html

>From the elegy:
His poems are hard-won gains--or perhaps stand-offs--in which the discipline of
poetry as much constrained the poet's freedom as it did subdue intractable
subject matter. But as Bowers knew, the poet's freedom is illusory, and in
catering to it, he runs the risk of entertaining the very chaos he would
elsewhere avoid.

Excuse me for posting a number of times, but since I'm new to the site,
I'm sort of thrilled to be here.  Here's the sticky.  Bernstein,
Perloff, et al have characterized conventional Poetry/New Yorker verse
as Romantic extensions.  Can't argue with that, but let's agree that
Romanticism is rich with methodologies and is hardly contained by that
sort of formulaic writing.  But my focus is not there.  Bernstein et al
have argued that Creative Workshop courses in the main train students
to imitate New Yorker style because it is formulaic and can be taught.
Bernstein et  al prefer a poetics that eschews formuli.  Okay, but if
that's the case, then it is much more difficult to qualify non-
formulaic writing since there are (theoretically) no models or rules
set in cement.  Now follow me here.  That means that such writing
can be sanctioned only through the market place, by surviving all
attacks on its integrity.  The Romantic thing is judged not only by
the market place, but also by how well it adheres to certain formuli.
Those formuli allow for something like an impersonal qualification,
whereas the market place is the only impersonal avenue open to avant
garde art.  Sure, we can pat each other on the back, but that is as
subjective as it gets.  As an experimental poet who detests New
Yorker verse, I wonder if we're not guilty of bad faith when we
denegrade the market.  Our own poetics seem to make us more dependent
on it for that great impersonal pat on the back (awards, immortality,
etc.) than are those New Yorker types.  Since there are no rules
by which we may be judged, aren't we sort of admitting (under our
breath) that the market place is the ultimate and only judge of our
work?

Brian & Kasey, yes, the experience/route you describe is very close to my
experience as well: a good drubbing by the canon (including various
contemp mainstream poets - for me it was people like, say, James Dickey,
Dave Smith, Ed Hirsch, Baron Wormser (who I still think is pretty damn
good), Lynn Emanuel (who gave a talk at the Robert Frost Festival in NH in
'92 on Language Poetry, and, as I remember it, was sort of shouted down));
then a disavowal of such upon discovery of more interesting work; and
finally, ocassionally, that experience Kasey describes: going back to one
of these people, opening a book and finding that whatever seemed
revelatory at the time had lost most of its luster, paling in comparison
to a Perelman or a Howe or a Mullen.  Still, I've tried to find little
ways to use this or that from my reading at 20 yrs old - and one thing
that's helped me alot is Ralph Ellison's sense of how things might be
appropriated from a writer whose world view / aesthetic view might not be
your own: if there's something there "that seems useful," Ellison says, "I
grab it.  Eclecticism is the word.  Like a jazz musician who creates his
own style out of the styles around him, I play it by ear." The eclectic
process (the process of *choosing*) transforms what ever is chosen -
decontextualizing and then recontextualizing.  This is less true in
relation to the poets I name above than it is w/ older British poets, say,
who in some ways I abhor (Pope): but why not trope Pope?  Certainly that
act doesn't necessarily imply acceptance, aesthetically, politically, or
otherwise.  Certainly in Kasey's work there's that "Elizabethan Big Band
music" as Bill Berkson puts it; but its estrangement from an Elizabethan,
or contemp British or even maudlin academic context is clear; and whatever
echoes, appropriated elements of style, are there, have sea-changed: like
Ornette Coleman playing abit of Tchaikovsky's 1st piano concerto in
"Congeniality."  It's all in the handling of the sample.   -m.

next 3 mon readings-- Gina Tabasso, Maj Regain, Tom Beckett

and also a special reading April 13th at Reality Theatre
Dan Raphael-- from Portland OR whose 13th book is out & as Ivan
Arguelles (forgive my unumlat) says "Like the best of his
contemporaries, Jake Berry or Will Alexander, Raphael takes his language
into the swiftly developing chasms of new sci-tech terminology, while
maintaining a balance of humor" reads w/ Julie Otten and John M. Bennett

Last night Larry's kicked off national poetry month with a reading by
Stephen Ellis in which he arrived extremely late with the "poet in ohio"
Brian Richards to an eager crowd of 66 people. We started the open early
even to satiate the droves of folks in from heavy rain slick streets.

After briefly introducing Ellis and reading section 1 of White Gravity
to prime the pumped attention span, he started the first set of 25
minutes reading short older pieces, ones found in To Hand, Embodyment
Air, the bull head Chapbook and various other pampheteering ephemera. It
was odd but noteworthy, to hear him read the shortish. We covered the
table in books, chapbooks, and thinner, many visiting the commerce in
between.

For the second set, Ellis read White Gravity in its entirety, sans
ending pictograph, then cracked into yelled out requests from The Long
and Short of It, including Sky Blue Pink, which had lift, lost the
audience in pilating dependent clause upon dependent clause upon
dependent clause until everyone was way out there, the last three
couplets to reel back in. This is surely a writer who knows a poem needs
only one period, that breath has expired except within a long line
frame. Someone in the back yelled out Broken Donut Mystery Cult, things
got hectic, anticipatory beer drank, Anton busy for night behind the
bar, then full-on quiet, the piece read in its folded out entirety. Much
hooting and hollering at the ending. Out here in Ohio, where we take
Poetry as a statewide sport, second only to Bluejackets hockey, even
Anton, the bartender, loved the reading, staying an extra hour to hear
It all, which says tomes. He's beat up poets for reading crappy poetry.

There was a heated open this fine evening. Highlights-- In the open
before Ellis, Cathy Callahan read a piece about Jesus rightists vs.
Students for free thought viz the modicum of Becketts best humourstance,
leaving us laughing hard and awkward, Frank Richards sluicing us with a
new poem, then post Ellis, Brian Richards dripping the love poem
sequence from the Dorn Worc's Aloud/Allowed, and Ex-NY ABC No Rio diva,
Julie Otten closed hard with her fantastic round bar poem.

Afterwards, a dozen came to my house for the private reading, light
libations and a heavy section of work from Tom Bridwell's newest prose
book, Stevie Mainard's memorable dead baby poem, a few of mine including
Suicide Pact, and a set of 25? pieces from Ellis' March writings which
were well received with Shakespearean comments on blank verse
perversions.

That's my memory of i(I)t, finally, trailing to bed now.

Larry's/ 2040 N. High St/ Columbus OH-- 7pm mondays, open afterward--
Funded by the Ohio Arts Council: a statewide agency which supports the
arts

Be well

Re: William James Austin's post apoetics.

Doesn't "language poetry" have its own formulae and cliches? The
paratactic juxtaposition of a political barb with a metapoetic
observation, for example?  The twisted or transformed cliche is itself a
language poetry cliche. This is not a critique of language poetry by any
means.  I just don't believe in some pure experimentalism not rooted in
particular traditions. There is no zero degree of poetics.  It is this
"traditional" aspect of experimental poetry that provides a scale of
values apart from those set by other marketplace forces (The New Yorker,
MFA programs, etc...).

On revision vs. non-revision. I think there is a danger of fetishizing
either option. Jazz is always brought up in this context as a model of
spontaneity, but jazz is very formulaic as well. Improvisation is actually
the recombining of formulae.  Jazz can be extremely cliche ridden, in
fact; even Ornette plays fairly formulaic "Ornetticisms."

One ethos of revision produces a fairly labored, "trying-to-hard" effect
(e.g. James Merrill).  Or it can aim to eliminate formulaic writing... I
personally do not revise poetry very much because I would prefer to spend
the time writing something else. I would rather throw away a bad poem than
work it to death.

... speaking of which, the third issue of Readme, which will hopefully be up
in late April/early May, could sure use some. I've got plenty of interviews,
but only a few reviews and one critical essay so far. I'd love to be able to
include more. If you've got any ideas of reviews you'd like to do, or maybe
a more general critical essay you'd like to make public, please let me know.
Also, if you run a literary web site (whether zine or "theme" site), I'd
love to get a brief statement on your project for inclusion in the section
on web publishing. Here are the interviews, at least what's planned, to give
you an idea of "context" or whatever:

Alysia Abbott / Anselm Berrigan / Bill Bissett / Mary-anne Breeze / Marcella
Durand / Peter Ganick / Mitch Highfill / Carol Mirakove / Mark Peters / Ron
Silliman / Brian Kim Stefans

Reviews don't have to be of books just published, though they should be more
or less current (published within the last couple of years).

Thanks!

William James Austin poses a question I've been thinking about for some
time. But the way he formulates the question presupposes that the work
cannot be measured by the audience for which it is written. This list is
perfect evidence of how work that rejects the mainstream can develop its own
samizdat and how samizdat provides unspoken measures for acceptance, which
usually tend to be more open than mainstream avenues, whether they be in
publishing, in academia, or in "po-biz". Even within academia there are
undercurrents of the samizdat. I haven't given much thought to what the
criteria for acceptance are around here, but I'm sure they would include
attention to theory and history, both inside and outside the poems. I'm sure
they would include "going by the musical phrase" (or the visual phrase). So
there are metrics that develop within the community and are not dictated by
the market. That, of course, is a slightly different question that how our
work is accepted in the mainstream, which seems to me to be a pipe dream and
not something many of us are shooting for anyway.

I've come to the conclusion, then, that "our" audience (that is, the
audience of readers engaged in writing published out of the mainstream and
which may consist only of "us") is the only real way our work can be
"judged". There are a few excellent critics like Prof. Perloff who do real
justice to the kind of work written in this and other subcommunities, but
that good attention has very little affect "out there" where thousands of
workshop poets and english dept. critics are content to read the same tame
poets over and over.  The New Yorker, APR, the Colorado Review, the Iowa
Review, et al., publish poets who, for the most part, come out of, teach in,
or write the kind of work that is taught in most academic creative writing
programs. We shouldn't expect them to do any differently any more than we
should expect Sulfur (RIP), Skanky Possum, or any other publications
frequented here to start publishing Gerald Stern.

"The market" is predisposed to reject work that rejects the market. How,
then, can we expect the market to serve as any kind of metric for that work?
If it's simply a matter of "surviving," then this line has done quite well
for over 75 years, thank you. I wouldn't consider surviving underground,
though, any kind of endorsement by the market.

I've not made myself very clear here, so I'll just end by saying communities
create sub-markets which are capable of validating and valuating with more
integrity than the general market. This has surely been the case throughout
the history and development of the arts in the 20th century.

Best to all,
BC

Excuse me for posting a number of times, but since I'm new to the site,
I'm sort of thrilled to be here.  Here's the sticky.  Bernstein,
Perloff, et al have characterized conventional Poetry/New Yorker verse
as Romantic extensions.  Can't argue with that, but let's agree that
Romanticism is rich with methodologies and is hardly contained by that
sort of formulaic writing.  But my focus is not there.  Bernstein et al
have argued that Creative Workshop courses in the main train students
to imitate New Yorker style because it is formulaic and can be taught.
Bernstein et  al prefer a poetics that eschews formuli.  Okay, but if
that's the case, then it is much more difficult to qualify non-
formulaic writing since there are (theoretically) no models or rules
set in cement.  Now follow me here.  That means that such writing
can be sanctioned only through the market place, by surviving all
attacks on its integrity.  The Romantic thing is judged not only by
the market place, but also by how well it adheres to certain formuli.
Those formuli allow for something like an impersonal qualification,
whereas the market place is the only impersonal avenue open to avant
garde art.  Sure, we can pat each other on the back, but that is as
subjective as it gets.  As an experimental poet who detests New
Yorker verse, I wonder if we're not guilty of bad faith when we
denegrade the market.  Our own poetics seem to make us more dependent
on it for that great impersonal pat on the back (awards, immortality,
etc.) than are those New Yorker types.  Since there are no rules
by which we may be judged, aren't we sort of admitting (under our
breath) that the market place is the ultimate and only judge of our
work?

Patrick,

This post really got close to the heart of things for me.  I too was drawn
to Joyce in my youth, & to the idea of a precise work which could encompass
everything in minutest detail (thus necessitating revision).  I agree that
Kerouac's position offers, in its quirky dogmatism, something like a
necessary counterbalance to Joycean extremes.  The question for me becomes
at what point is either position liberating (I don't mean for the writer so
much as for the work)-- leading to the moment where, as O'Hara said,
refreshment arrives.  I don't really trust that either course, followed
dogmatically, naturally results in the best writing-- just as I don't trust
that any sort of dogmatism can be good for poetry in the long term.  While I
tend to subscribe to the Kerouac/Coolidge position that the liberatory is a
big part of the purpose for writing, I also revise a lot, & see no
contradiction in that.  Common sense and intuition will tell you when to
revise & when to leave it alone.  This, for me, is the real question-- one
for which some writers never find a satisfactory answer.

My thought, too. More about work being ongoing than about discrete
poems-as-final-products. Plus, it leaves me room to cannibalize any and all
bits and pieces from my own/other people's work & recontextualize, which is
the most fun of all.

For proverbs See Mathews' Selected Declarations of Dependence
(Sun & Moon Press 1996)
Terrific.
(See also the Oulipo Compendium for more Mathews' stuff and also LOTS of
other good stuff.)

Well, yes and no. Or yes, but for other reasons than the one you give, I
think. One has only to recall Coltrane's near-obsessive working-through and
extension of harmonic theory (almost to the point of liquidation, see John
Schott's excellent analysis in Arcana, ed. John Zorn, Granary Books) to
realize that much of the lauded spontaneity of jazz takes extension from a
ground of study: of "formulae," certainly, but also of histories,
"traditions," other individual and collective performance styles, etc. In
part, this is one of the fringe benefits of its being a music nearly all of
whose development occurs after the advent of recording, which makes gestural
"idiosyncrasy" a site for a certain kind of historical knowledge, dodgy as
the status of the recording might be in terms of its relation to an
improvised performance. (Witness, in contrast, the elegiac attempts to
reconstruct "authentic" Baroque performance practice by a sector of European
concert music scholars. Worthwhile or not, (and some of the
"authentic-tuning" performances are quite beautiful) it's a fundamentally
different endeavor).

Other examples might include Ornette's Tchaikovsky quotation, mentioned by
Mike Magee, or his more openly parodic "A Fifth of Beethoven," or even his
post-Ives vocabulary in "Skies of America." Also Anthony Braxton's attempt
to found his music on a series of identifiable languages, starting from the
solo saxophone recording "For Alto" (which, music fans, is slated for
reissue by Delmark Records in June or July) - vocabularies and syntaxes of
musical performance that provide an identifiable and "developable" set of
resources for "post-free" jazz performance. And on a different cultural
scale, his series of "In the Tradition" recordings, which intertwine "out"
innovation with the most "in the pocket" elements of jazz history so deeply
that they end up making the argument for a tradition precisely of such
departures. In a more immediate sense, there's tenor and soprano player Sam
Rivers' assertion that, as a young musician, he studied all the other horn
players in order to develop, through reflection, an approach to his
instruments unlike anyone else's.

All of which is meant by way of adducing some evidence that perhaps a
distinction between spontaneity and cliche might not be the most accurate
way to locate the "essence" of jazz performance, and perhaps by extension,
improvisation in other arts. (Remaining, as I do, both deeply wary and
deeply enamored of "using" the poetics of improvised music as an analogy for
my own sense of practice as a writer). Your claim that jazz is not usually a
matter of unreflective spontaneity seems pretty much right-on to me - with
the caveat that most practitioners and knowledgeable critics and theorists
of the music don't make a bid for such absence of cerebration, unless
there's some definite polemical target at hand. One example of this might be
the claims made for and by various "New Thing" players, circa mid-60s, that
their music was a form of unfettered expression, a "spontaneous upsurge," to
go Sartrean for a moment. But emphasized nearly as often alongside that
claim was the collective, historical nature of this expression - jazz being
used, performatively, to instantiate an under-represented,
under-acknowledged historical claim of African American culture, in the mode
of a "breakdown/breakthrough" of norms. Sometimes this took directly
political shape, as with, say, Archie Shepp, sometimes a movement toward
transcendence, through alternative/creative modes of spiritual practice
which stood in a more implicitly critical relation to immanent possibility,
as with, say, Coltrane, or Amina Claudione Myers' "return" to gospel, or, in
a different mode, Sun Ra. And obviously, the "expression" of a suppressed
history/repressed possibility often had recourse to the distinctive musical
languages of that tradition in the name of exactly such possibility - again,
a tradition of departures. Which is not to say there wasn't plenty of bad,
ill-considered free blowing to be had, alongside bad, ill-considered swing,
and bad, ill-considered German Enlightenment symphonic music.

Of course, a different sort of claim for "free expression" often gets made -
still, today, but in a more publicly visible mode from bop though the first
generation of the "new thing" - by certain white dissident intellectuals,
who are, to put it bluntly, projecting. One thinks of the problematic
aspects of Kerouac's reception of jazz, as if the writer who often made the
loudest claims for "spontaneity" in verbal art, conscious of his own
less-than-total commitment to the moment, his "corrupting" habit of
reflection and revision, had to stage another sector of his society as the
performance of the "authentic" spontaneity to which his rhetoric aspired.
(For all that he's often pretty appalling on jazz, Kerouac _can_ be much
more subtle than that - this is not meant as a blanket dismissal. If nothing
else, he certainly understood bop rhythm better than Ferlinghetti). More
recently, there was the Newsweek review of a performance by Anthony Braxton,
who is habitually painted by the jazz press as some sort of disembodied
brain with a horn. This reviewer, however, wrote admiringly of Braxton's
"muscular" and "violent" attack on his horn, his tone which spoke of
"ghettoes" and "streets," his "animal cries." So the usual cold reception
afforded one of this country's most significant performer-composers (ok,
that's me talking) gets inverted into lavish praise, but only at the expense
of a nearly obscene projection that begins by taking musical performance as
a form of inarticulate, tragic protest and ends by bordering on a revocation
of the performer's humanity. (This anecdote, by the way, comes from Graham
Lock's new book Blutopia, which touches on the musical and cultural poetics
of Duke Ellington, Sun Ra, and Braxton. Braxton himself refers to the whole
complex of projections, ascription of imaginary powers, and pre-emptive
deprivations and channelizations, as the "across the tracks syndrome").

A twist or new inflection in your term "formulae" might do it for me - I
think here of chemistry, the way in which certain formulae of elements and
energy lead to physical state changes or simple mixtures (recombination of
cliches), while others lead to chemical reactions that produce new solutions
(spontaneity, perhaps, in that the "new" behaves often unpredictably in
terms of the several "olds" which react to produce it - a rooted or radical
spontaneity). And I'd like to let the fortuitous play on "solution" stand
there. Of course, you won't get me to deny that "simple mixture" does often
result, even among the music's great practitioners: Ornette's recent Prime
Time work, for example, often hits my ears as an extended essay in stylistic
entrenchment, so there we might be in agreement. This, for me, is less a
function of the electrified, "funk" nature of the band than the
inflexibility of its recent rhythm sections and the rather foursquare
phrasing that demands - certainly with Jamaaladeen Tacuma and Calvin Weston
there was enough flex-time in Prime Time's funk to allow Ornette the space
for asymmetry and a kind of "reach". And if it's not simply a matter of the
instrumentation, it's even less a matter of the whole musical tradition -
jazz isn't, in any essential way, "very formulaic." That it _can_ be thus,
and that listeners and practitioners are often willing to distinguish the
formulaic moments from the breakthroughs, substantiates something Ornette
said in an interview. (This is in the liner notes to something, but once
again I'm writing from work - my guess would be the _Beauty Is a Rare Thing_
box set. I'll paraphrase here). Having jettisoned or radically undermined
the harmonic basis of your improvisations, the interviewer asks, how do you
make sense of this music? How do you know that this is a real practice that
you and others can "go on" with, and not just a solipsistic denial of
history? Coleman's answer: I realized it was a real thing when I discovered
that it was possible, when playing it, to make a mistake. Thinking of this
in terms of a relation to history, one might recall Althusser's
famous/infamous statement, (paraphrasing again, sorry) to the effect that
there are events, and then there's history, and there's a difference.

So again, a roundabout way of saying "Yes, but..." Fetishizing spontaneity
is certainly a danger, particularly when it makes use of jazz to make its
point, and thus misappropriates a large and deeply-rooted set of African
American cultural practices and histories to the end of a fairly dubious
conclusion. In this, though, I'd say the dubiety of the means seems to me
the more dangerous aspect of the formula, since the conclusion itself seems
more or less foregone without this prop. Jazz is, whether one's a "fan" or
not, an incredibly significant component of the ensemble we might call the
poetics of 20th-Century American and even world culture. (For a couple
indications of how deep this might go, in terms of the ways jazz practice
informs other streams of culture and politics, one could certainly do worse
than look at Mike Magee's essay in Kenning #4, Mackey's novels, and George
Lewis' forthcoming (?) book on the AACM, along with Val Wilmer's hopefully
soon-republished As Serious as Your Life, Baraka's writings on music, etc.,
etc.)

Given this importance, I'd want to insist, with you, that jazz improvisation
is not simply a matter of unrehearsed spontaneity - and to insist further,
along with Braxton, that to treat it as such is to approach it only in the
mode of the exotic. But I'd want to insist on the flip side as well: that
there is such a thing as improvisation, that it's not simply a stringing
together of quotes and ready riffs, and that it's characteristic of at least
a significant portion of what we mislabel "jazz." For a look at how  hotly
contested this point has been in the music's history (or the history of its
reception by listeners better acquainted with Europe's Enlightenment concert
music tradition), Cecil Taylor's 1964 panel appearance at Bennington College
in Vermont provides an interesting study. In the following exchange between
Taylor and Hall Overton, what emerges is a fairly clear sense of how the
denial or at least circumscription of the validity of improvisation in jazz
becomes a foot in the door for those who, like Overton, seem to want to
diminish that tradition and history by an invidious comparison with "serious
music." If you'd rather read the whole surviving transcript of the panel,
typos and all, the URL is http://www.the-spa.com/mw/.

All best,
Taylor

TRANSCRIPT FOLLOWS
-------------------------------
Overton: What was the difference between what Duke and what Lennie did? Duke
wrote it out, didn't he?
Taylor: Oh...That's another problem. What difference does that make? The
only thing that we know about - the only thing that the listener knows
about - is the sounds that he hears. I don't think it makes any difference
that the sound is notated because the symbol doesn't make the music. It is
the men striking the instruments, striking the pieces of wood or whatever.
It's the sound that we're confronted with, not the symbol. Because in other
cultures they don't use our symbols, but they make music, they make sounds.
Overton: I would disagree on that one point because I would make a
distinction, Cecil, between an idea that's improvised and that just occurs
at the moment, and an idea that is already arrived at, preconceived.
Taylor: How can an idea come, you know, into being without certain things
happening? I mean, if you write a composition - all the great composers that
you were talking about which happened to be in a particular school - all the
great composers have been improvisors...
Overton: That's right.
Taylor: Now, the only difference is that certain people wish to notate their
improvisations. That's all. And other people improvise - now what does that
mean? It simply means that these people who choose to improvise utilize
certain physical things in their characteristics and and transpose them to
the instruments and, after a certain amount of years, these things take
shape in a form...Like the Charlie Parker expression. He uses certain
material, certain forms if you will, and he brings these to like his
improvisations.
Overton: Well, Hadyn used to improvise every morning, I read in a book
someplace. I wasn't there, I don't know, but I understand that he did and
then in the afternoon he composed...
Taylor: Do you make a distinction between composition and improvisation?
Overton: That's right. That's exactly the point I want to make. I think that
the music he wrote in the after noon was stimulating [sic] by his
improvisation in the morning - but I think that it was better music because
it was reflective and he spent time on it and he also undoubtedly changed
things that he never would have changed if he just improvised them. And he
had time to change them. He used more than his intuition in the afternoon -
he used his mind and he used intellectual conscious control over his
material and that's what I think a composition is, and I believe that
improvisation is just the opposite. I believe a truly improvised thing is a
truly intuitive thing - a thing of the moment and undoubtedly conditioned
by, you know, what you were saying before about your whole background. How
you think about your condition - you are going to get certain ideas because
of what you are and how you are going to think. But in real improvisation
you don't have time to polish those ideas - they come at the moment - they
are what they are and that's it because...
Taylor: That's what we are and all we can ever be: what we are at the
moment. Even if we reflect upon that which we have done in the morning, when
we write in the afternoon that's all we are - what we are at the moment. The
sum total of the existance is like what it is up to the point that you die -
that's all. So that if a cat chooses to improvise, which is, you know, a
technical mastery of certain materials put in the framework of certain
forms. And we are talking about jazz, so we'll talk about its first form
which is the Blues. You cannot tell me - you'll have to prove it to me -
that, when after twenty years of playing, that Charlie Parker didn't play
the Blues as many different ways as was possible within his experience. And
if he had sat down to write this it wouldn't have been any more valid,
because, in the final analysis, what we heard was what we heard..[Overton
tries to speak, Taylor goes on.] Just a minute, just a minute, what you are
negating there is that there is skill in improvisation. What you're negating
is that - wait a minute, wait a minute. Polish, you used the work polish
before. When one sites down to compose one...it's sort of like a spiritual -
this is Sunday - a spiritual thing. You know, you sit down and you start
writing and you become reflective and your mind works. But whoever told you
that in order to play the piano, or in order to do anything, you don't use
your mind?
Overton: Nobody told me. I play the piano so I know what you're talking
about.
Taylor: Wait a minute, wait a minute. Now let's get into this further. You
talk about jazz community, you know, and I want you to define what you mean
by community and how it actually works in, you know...like, for instance,
what do you do?
Overton: By jazz community I mean the fact that...
Taylor: Perhaps before we go any further, we better define what jazz is.
Overton: No, I'm not going to get into that...
[Laughter]
Taylor: Why not? Why not? How can we talk about the future of something that
we can't even define? What are we talking about?
Overton: Let me define jazz community. You have to be able to play jazz with
someone else. Well if you have four people, that's a community. If you have
three...
Taylor: Well, Haydn played with somebody too. Was he playing jazz?
Overton: No, he played by himself.
Taylor: No, no, no - his chamber work, you know, and his symphony, you know.
People played together, does that mean it's jazz because they played
together?
Overton: The idea of a jazz community is that jazz is really based on more
than one person playing together, and you have to be able to say, and you
have to be able to agree musically.
Taylor: Well what is this thing you're calling jazz? That's what I want to
know first and now let's get that that [sic] before we start talking
about...
Overton: I think that would be stupid to get into. We could spend all day -
you have your ideas, I have mine...
Taylor: Well that's what we're here for, to express ideas, isn't it?
Overton: No, I've been on panels like that and it's the most useless thing
that I've ever...
Taylor: Well what are we doing now but talking about ideas? You mean you're
expressing what you think is stupid. You see, so that's an idea, that's an
opinion.
[Laughter]

Re: William James Austin's post apoetics.

Doesn't "language poetry" have its own formulae and cliches? The
paratactic juxtaposition of a political barb with a metapoetic
observation, for example?  The twisted or transformed cliche is itself a
language poetry cliche. This is not a critique of language poetry by any
means.  I just don't believe in some pure experimentalism not rooted in
particular traditions. There is no zero degree of poetics.  It is this
"traditional" aspect of experimental poetry that provides a scale of
values apart from those set by other marketplace forces (The New Yorker,
MFA programs, etc...).

On revision vs. non-revision. I think there is a danger of fetishizing
either option. Jazz is always brought up in this context as a model of
spontaneity, but jazz is very formulaic as well. Improvisation is actually
the recombining of formulae.  Jazz can be extremely cliche ridden, in
fact; even Ornette plays fairly formulaic "Ornetticisms."

One ethos of revision produces a fairly labored, "trying-to-hard" effect
(e.g. James Merrill).  Or it can aim to eliminate formulaic writing... I
personally do not revise poetry very much because I would prefer to spend
the time writing something else. I would rather throw away a bad poem than
work it to death.

The early 1970s saw a number of poets exploring what could be done with the
clich=E9. (It was then that I first heard of, and thus read, Flaubert's
wonderful work with the clich=E9s of chat, _The Dictionary of Received Ideas=
_
). Perhaps I will call to mind some titles from that brief era, of books to
bear out my statement. Certainly my own "Tight Corners" evidence this
interest. I have always found Michael Davidson's ability to stand clich=E9s
on their head in an hysterical string of mixed metaphors most enjoyable ;
he began to publish then. The short story writer and novelist Sherril Jaffe
gave a talk at the SF Art Institute somewhat after the peak of this
project, in 1979 I believe, titled "Standing By the Clich=E9." Her books til=
l
this time, _Scars Make Your Body More Interesting_ and _This Flower Only
Blooms Every Hundred Years_ , exemplify her practice in this respect.

Brian & Kasey, yes, the experience/route you describe is very close to my
experience as well: a good drubbing by the canon (including various
contemp mainstream poets - for me it was people like, say, James Dickey,
Dave Smith, Ed Hirsch, Baron Wormser (who I still think is pretty damn
good), Lynn Emanuel (who gave a talk at the Robert Frost Festival in NH in
'92 on Language Poetry, and, as I remember it, was sort of shouted down));
then a disavowal of such upon discovery of more interesting work; and
finally, ocassionally, that experience Kasey describes: going back to one
of these people, opening a book and finding that whatever seemed
revelatory at the time had lost most of its luster, paling in comparison
to a Perelman or a Howe or a Mullen.  Still, I've tried to find little
ways to use this or that from my reading at 20 yrs old - and one thing
that's helped me alot is Ralph Ellison's sense of how things might be
appropriated from a writer whose world view / aesthetic view might not be
your own: if there's something there "that seems useful," Ellison says, "I
grab it.  Eclecticism is the word.  Like a jazz musician who creates his
own style out of the styles around him, I play it by ear." The eclectic
process (the process of *choosing*) transforms what ever is chosen -
decontextualizing and then recontextualizing.  This is less true in
relation to the poets I name above than it is w/ older British poets, say,
who in some ways I abhor (Pope): but why not trope Pope?  Certainly that
act doesn't necessarily imply acceptance, aesthetically, politically, or
otherwise.  Certainly in Kasey's work there's that "Elizabethan Big Band
music" as Bill Berkson puts it; but its estrangement from an Elizabethan,
or contemp British or even maudlin academic context is clear; and whatever
echoes, appropriated elements of style, are there, have sea-changed: like
Ornette Coleman playing abit of Tchaikovsky's 1st piano concerto in
"Congeniality."  It's all in the handling of the sample.   -m.

Subject: real poetry month

next 3 mon readings-- Gina Tabasso, Maj Regain, Tom Beckett

and also a special reading April 13th at Reality Theatre
Dan Raphael-- from Portland OR whose 13th book is out & as Ivan
Arguelles (forgive my unumlat) says "Like the best of his
contemporaries, Jake Berry or Will Alexander, Raphael takes his language
into the swiftly developing chasms of new sci-tech terminology, while
maintaining a balance of humor" reads w/ Julie Otten and John M. Bennett

Last night Larry's kicked off national poetry month with a reading by
Stephen Ellis in which he arrived extremely late with the "poet in ohio"
Brian Richards to an eager crowd of 66 people. We started the open early
even to satiate the droves of folks in from heavy rain slick streets.

After briefly introducing Ellis and reading section 1 of White Gravity
to prime the pumped attention span, he started the first set of 25
minutes reading short older pieces, ones found in To Hand, Embodyment
Air, the bull head Chapbook and various other pampheteering ephemera. It
was odd but noteworthy, to hear him read the shortish. We covered the
table in books, chapbooks, and thinner, many visiting the commerce in
between.

For the second set, Ellis read White Gravity in its entirety, sans
ending pictograph, then cracked into yelled out requests from The Long
and Short of It, including Sky Blue Pink, which had lift, lost the
audience in pilating dependent clause upon dependent clause upon
dependent clause until everyone was way out there, the last three
couplets to reel back in. This is surely a writer who knows a poem needs
only one period, that breath has expired except within a long line
frame. Someone in the back yelled out Broken Donut Mystery Cult, things
got hectic, anticipatory beer drank, Anton busy for night behind the
bar, then full-on quiet, the piece read in its folded out entirety. Much
hooting and hollering at the ending. Out here in Ohio, where we take
Poetry as a statewide sport, second only to Bluejackets hockey, even
Anton, the bartender, loved the reading, staying an extra hour to hear
It all, which says tomes. He's beat up poets for reading crappy poetry.

There was a heated open this fine evening. Highlights-- In the open
before Ellis, Cathy Callahan read a piece about Jesus rightists vs.
Students for free thought viz the modicum of Becketts best humourstance,
leaving us laughing hard and awkward, Frank Richards sluicing us with a
new poem, then post Ellis, Brian Richards dripping the love poem
sequence from the Dorn Worc's Aloud/Allowed, and Ex-NY ABC No Rio diva,
Julie Otten closed hard with her fantastic round bar poem.

Afterwards, a dozen came to my house for the private reading, light
libations and a heavy section of work from Tom Bridwell's newest prose
book, Stevie Mainard's memorable dead baby poem, a few of mine including
Suicide Pact, and a set of 25? pieces from Ellis' March writings which
were well received with Shakespearean comments on blank verse
perversions.

That's my memory of i(I)t, finally, trailing to bed now.

Larry's/ 2040 N. High St/ Columbus OH-- 7pm mondays, open afterward--
Funded by the Ohio Arts Council: a statewide agency which supports the
arts

Be well

Subject: formulae

Re: William James Austin's post apoetics.

Doesn't "language poetry" have its own formulae and cliches? The
paratactic juxtaposition of a political barb with a metapoetic
observation, for example?  The twisted or transformed cliche is itself a
language poetry cliche. This is not a critique of language poetry by any
means.  I just don't believe in some pure experimentalism not rooted in
particular traditions. There is no zero degree of poetics.  It is this
"traditional" aspect of experimental poetry that provides a scale of
values apart from those set by other marketplace forces (The New Yorker,
MFA programs, etc...).

On revision vs. non-revision. I think there is a danger of fetishizing
either option. Jazz is always brought up in this context as a model of
spontaneity, but jazz is very formulaic as well. Improvisation is actually
the recombining of formulae.  Jazz can be extremely cliche ridden, in
fact; even Ornette plays fairly formulaic "Ornetticisms."

One ethos of revision produces a fairly labored, "trying-to-hard" effect
(e.g. James Merrill).  Or it can aim to eliminate formulaic writing... I
personally do not revise poetry very much because I would prefer to spend
the time writing something else. I would rather throw away a bad poem than
work it to death.

Subject: "Criticism" Request

... speaking of which, the third issue of Readme, which will hopefully be up
in late April/early May, could sure use some. I've got plenty of interviews,
but only a few reviews and one critical essay so far. I'd love to be able to
include more. If you've got any ideas of reviews you'd like to do, or maybe
a more general critical essay you'd like to make public, please let me know.
Also, if you run a literary web site (whether zine or "theme" site), I'd
love to get a brief statement on your project for inclusion in the section
on web publishing. Here are the interviews, at least what's planned, to give
you an idea of "context" or whatever:

Alysia Abbott / Anselm Berrigan / Bill Bissett / Mary-anne Breeze / Marcella
Durand / Peter Ganick / Mitch Highfill / Carol Mirakove / Mark Peters / Ron
Silliman / Brian Kim Stefans

Reviews don't have to be of books just published, though they should be more
or less current (published within the last couple of years).

Thanks!

Subject: Re: APOETICS

William James Austin poses a question I've been thinking about for some
time. But the way he formulates the question presupposes that the work
cannot be measured by the audience for which it is written. This list is
perfect evidence of how work that rejects the mainstream can develop its own
samizdat and how samizdat provides unspoken measures for acceptance, which
usually tend to be more open than mainstream avenues, whether they be in
publishing, in academia, or in "po-biz". Even within academia there are
undercurrents of the samizdat. I haven't given much thought to what the
criteria for acceptance are around here, but I'm sure they would include
attention to theory and history, both inside and outside the poems. I'm sure
they would include "going by the musical phrase" (or the visual phrase). So
there are metrics that develop within the community and are not dictated by
the market. That, of course, is a slightly different question that how our
work is accepted in the mainstream, which seems to me to be a pipe dream and
not something many of us are shooting for anyway.

I've come to the conclusion, then, that "our" audience (that is, the
audience of readers engaged in writing published out of the mainstream and
which may consist only of "us") is the only real way our work can be
"judged". There are a few excellent critics like Prof. Perloff who do real
justice to the kind of work written in this and other subcommunities, but
that good attention has very little affect "out there" where thousands of
workshop poets and english dept. critics are content to read the same tame
poets over and over.  The New Yorker, APR, the Colorado Review, the Iowa
Review, et al., publish poets who, for the most part, come out of, teach in,
or write the kind of work that is taught in most academic creative writing
programs. We shouldn't expect them to do any differently any more than we
should expect Sulfur (RIP), Skanky Possum, or any other publications
frequented here to start publishing Gerald Stern.

"The market" is predisposed to reject work that rejects the market. How,
then, can we expect the market to serve as any kind of metric for that work?
If it's simply a matter of "surviving," then this line has done quite well
for over 75 years, thank you. I wouldn't consider surviving underground,
though, any kind of endorsement by the market.

I've not made myself very clear here, so I'll just end by saying communities
create sub-markets which are capable of validating and valuating with more
integrity than the general market. This has surely been the case throughout
the history and development of the arts in the 20th century.

Best to all,
BC

Subject: APOETICS


Excuse me for posting a number of times, but since I'm new to the site,
I'm sort of thrilled to be here.  Here's the sticky.  Bernstein,
Perloff, et al have characterized conventional Poetry/New Yorker verse
as Romantic extensions.  Can't argue with that, but let's agree that
Romanticism is rich with methodologies and is hardly contained by that
sort of formulaic writing.  But my focus is not there.  Bernstein et al
have argued that Creative Workshop courses in the main train students
to imitate New Yorker style because it is formulaic and can be taught.
Bernstein et  al prefer a poetics that eschews formuli.  Okay, but if
that's the case, then it is much more difficult to qualify non-
formulaic writing since there are (theoretically) no models or rules
set in cement.  Now follow me here.  That means that such writing
can be sanctioned only through the market place, by surviving all
attacks on its integrity.  The Romantic thing is judged not only by
the market place, but also by how well it adheres to certain formuli.
Those formuli allow for something like an impersonal qualification,
whereas the market place is the only impersonal avenue open to avant
garde art.  Sure, we can pat each other on the back, but that is as
subjective as it gets.  As an experimental poet who detests New
Yorker verse, I wonder if we're not guilty of bad faith when we
denegrade the market.  Our own poetics seem to make us more dependent
on it for that great impersonal pat on the back (awards, immortality,
etc.) than are those New Yorker types.  Since there are no rules
by which we may be judged, aren't we sort of admitting (under our
breath) that the market place is the ultimate and only judge of our
work?

Subject: Re: to revise or not?

Patrick,

This post really got close to the heart of things for me.  I too was drawn
to Joyce in my youth, & to the idea of a precise work which could encompass
everything in minutest detail (thus necessitating revision).  I agree that
Kerouac's position offers, in its quirky dogmatism, something like a
necessary counterbalance to Joycean extremes.  The question for me becomes
at what point is either position liberating (I don't mean for the writer so
much as for the work)-- leading to the moment where, as O'Hara said,
refreshment arrives.  I don't really trust that either course, followed
dogmatically, naturally results in the best writing-- just as I don't trust
that any sort of dogmatism can be good for poetry in the long term.  While I
tend to subscribe to the Kerouac/Coolidge position that the liberatory is a
big part of the purpose for writing, I also revise a lot, & see no
contradiction in that.  Common sense and intuition will tell you when to
revise & when to leave it alone.  This, for me, is the real question-- one
for which some writers never find a satisfactory answer.

transparent to bacteria, prions, viruses,
mother-father bacteria, slime & molecular soup,

#16: SIANNE NGAI / ABIGAIL CHILD
reading & in dialogue, April 13th, 6pm, Writers House,
3805 Locust Walk, Philadelphia / Free & open to the
imaginary public sphere.

Latest newsletter -- new poetry by, letters to/
from, Ngai & Child -- now available:

http://www.english.upenn.edu/~wh/phillytalks

Click "archive" for text. You'll need Acrobat plug-in,
which is free; a link to get it is at the web site. The
PhillyTalks website -- "sous construction" -- is designed
by Aaron Levy, by May 1st will feature all back issues of
newsletter.

The Poets, The Newsletter, The Upcoming Events:

Sianne Ngai: poet-critic, author of criteria
(O Books), Discredit (Burning Deck), My Novel (Leave
Books). Her critical writings on contemporary poetry have
appeared in Postmodern Culture, Open Letter, and The
Poetry Project Newsletter (a review of Juliana Spahr's Response).
Her essay "Raw Matter: A Poetics of Disgust" is also forthcoming
in Tell It Slant: Avant-Garde Poetics of the 1990s, an anthology
edited by Mark Wallace and Steven Marks. Recent poetic work
can be found in Object, edited by Rob Fitterman, Xcp (Cross-
Cultural Poetics), edited by Mark Nowak, and a collaboration with
Brian Kim Stefans in Interlope, edited by Summi Kaipa. She lives in
Brooklyn, NYC.

Abigail Child is author of several poetry books, including
A Motive for Mayhem (Potes & Poets, 1989), Mob (O Books, c. 1995),
Scatter Matrix (Roof, 1996), and essays on contemporary
theory in its relation to poetry and film that have appeared in
journals including Poetics Journal and Raddle Moon. She is also an
award-winning film- and videomaker who has exhibited her work
extensively including the Whitney Biennial, the New York Film
Festival, and the London Film Festival. She lives in New York City.

"Philly Talks" is a construct of dialogue with contemporary poets begun
in 1998 with a modernist Mission From Form, set in pre-"renaissance"
body time, with future-minded arbitrariness of the memory function in
verse. Fifteen faux dialogues -- enough to restore Bakhtin’s faux leg
& a Voloshinovic mirror site in a de-Stalinated union --
are constructed to date (list, below). The newsletter presents
responses by two poets, each to the other's aura; these are
textually available on-line & in hard copy about one week prior to
their actualization in the time of Being itself, as event. As event --
at best structurally concise in its evasions & phenomenologically
unbounded by individual consciousness -- it is both a reading by
the poets, with symbolic pinning of medals on chest of drawers
beside dart board, & all-night squatting of the premises,
with audience sending up of flares, Spinozist space-time cubism,
verbal misappropriations of numerological endorsements, &
a vast stomachification & disgorgement of food & wine, thereby
extending the hangover of newsletter "conversation".

ANNOUNCEMENT:

Next week Pierre Joris & Nicole Peyrafitte will be giving two performances
in the San Diego area.

Both performances will feature different programs

        Friday, April 14th 7:30pm
        at the Porter Troupe Gallery.
        301 Spruce Street between 4th and 3rd Avenues in the Balboa Park area of
        downtown San Diego
        ($8/$5). Call for more info at (619) 291-9096 Seating Limited

        Wednesday, April 19th 4:30pm at USCD-Visual Arts Performance Space
        (Free). Parking on campus is $6 a car.

        For those who are not familiar with UCSD parking rules there is some
further info:
        Parking on campus often involves parking at an outlying lot and taking a
shuttle to where the event is located. If one doesn't know the campus, It is
recommended getting to the parking kiosk at least an hour before the event
to allow yourself time to get to a parking lot, catch a shuttle and then get
to the room for the event. There is extremely limited meter parking, which
costs a dollar an hour(machines only take quarters).
The parking people are very aggressive about giving tickets to people who
park without the proper permits or in loading zones.

The Visual Arts Performance Space is located at the rear of the Visual Arts
Facility, which is at the intersection of Russell Lane and Lyman Drive. The
Gilman entrance kiosk has maps of the campus. The VAP space is in  the
general vicinity of the Literature Dept. building,
if that would help anyone who's trying to figure out which corner of the
campus it occupies.

POETRY CENTER 2000
The Poetry Center & American Poetry Archives
presents

Two collaborative evenings in April with
San Francisco Cinematheque
at Yerba Buena Center for the Arts

=3Dx=3Dx=3Dx=3Dx=3Dx=3Dx=3Dx=3Dx=3Dx=3Dx=3Dx=3Dx=3Dx=3Dx=3Dx=3Dx=3D

An evening with TRINH T. MINH-HA
Thursday April 6, 7:30 pm, $7 donation
@ Yerba Buena Center for the Arts (Mission & 3rd Street)
San Francisco

presented in collaboration with
San Francisco Cinematheque
& Center for the Arts

TRINH MINH-HA in her unique and beautifully composed film-works (A Tale of
Love, Shoot for the Contents, Reassemblage, Naked Spaces--Living is Round,
Surname Viet Given Name Nam) is a lyricist of the first order, an
imaginative seer and thinker whose art radically remakes narrative modes of
filmmaking by invoking then reinventing the tools of the anthropologist,
the poet and political witness, the visual artist and the musical composer.
*  Tonight we offer a rare chance to hear Ms. Trinh read from her written
work--the latest manifestation of which, Cinema Interval, is new from
Routledge.  *  She'll also read from the book, Drawn from African Spaces
(Indiana University Press, 1996), done in collaboration with Jean-Paul
Bourdier, and a portion of the film Naked Spaces--Living is Round will be
screened.  *

This event is supported by Poets & Writers, Inc., through a grant it has
received from The James Irvine Foundation.

*  Note, beginning Friday April 7th and continuing over the three following
=46ridays, Trinh Minh-ha's films will be presented in downtown Berkeley at
the Fine Arts Cinema, 510-848-1143.  *

An evening with GAD HOLLANDER
Thursday April 13, 7:30 pm, $7 donation
@ Yerba Buena Center for the Arts (Mission & 3rd Street)
San Francisco

a reading & film screening
presented in collaboration with
SF Cinematheque & Center for the Arts

GAD HOLLANDER is a poet and filmmaker living in London.  *  His latest book
of poetry, and first to be published in the US, Walserian Waltzes (Avec
Books, 2000) is just out--an extraordinary hall-of-mirrors poem-in-prose
revolving around the figure of Robert Walser, the great Swiss-German writer
of "minimal" fictions whose work stood behind Kafka and others.  *

We'll also be screening his film Diary of a Sane Man (1990, 85 min.).  *
"This poet-turned-filmmaker's first feature-length film (made on a budget,
he points out, for a 15-minute short, using borrowed equipment and
scavenged, odds-and-ends stock) is a serendipitous blend of art and irony,
philosophic reflection, double-edged nonsense, improvisation, mythology,
and the music of Johann Sebastian Bach. 'In my mind, the music is the main
narrative,' Hollander states. 'I've been told that this is a typical first
feature film because it has everything in it.  That's true, but only
because I wanted to have everything in it.  I wanted to present a textured
complexity.'" (Melissa Drier, Filmfest Journal, Berlin). *

Gad Hollander was born in Jerusalem, and spent, as he puts it, "(in/un-)
formative years" in Queens, New York.  *  Tonight's event is his first
public appearance in the Bay Area.  *

Thanks, Brian, for you insightful reply.  This is fun!!  But I still
see a problem with audience as judge.  On what basis do they judge,
since there are no rules?  But of course there are rules, and you have
suggested a couple of borders (music, visuals)--and avant garde styles
can be taught, and are, in the academy.  It is also true that most
New Yorker types will also never achieve wide public aclaim.  And since
Mac Low has recently won the $100,000 Tanning Prize from the Academy
of American poets, and Charles spoke at the Frost Medal Award to
Barbara Guest, how long before we are the establishment?  It's
already happened.  Scary thought.

Subject:      twisting cliches
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="iso-8859-1"

Here's an example:

        Darkness falls like a wet sponge,
        And Dick gives Genevieve a swift punch
        In the pajamas.  "Aroint thee, witch."
        Her tongue from previous ecstasy
        Releases thoughts like little hats.

I think Ashbery wrote this in college, so I'll guess 1948.  Auden was
probably whipping around cliches before that, like in "As I Walked Out One
Evening."  I've found it online, it's not as cliche-ridden as I imagined but
here are the opening stanzas:

        As I walked out one evening,
                Walking down Bristol Street,
        The crowds upon the pavement
                Were fields of harvest wheat.

        And down by the brimming river
                I heard a lover sing
        Under an arch of the railway:
                'Love has no ending.

        'I'll love you, dear, I'll love you
                Till China and Africa meet,
        And the river jumps over the mountain
                And the salmon sing in the street,

        'I'll love you till the ocean
                Is folded and hung up to dry
        And the seven stars go squawking
                Like geese about the sky.

        'The years shall run like rabbits,
                For in my arms I hold
        The Flower of the Ages,
                And the first love of the world.

        'But all the clocks in the city
                Began to whirr and chime:
        'O let not Time deceive you,
                You cannot conquer Time. etc., etc.,

While this is hardly Language poetry, it is a bit different from a
Pound/Browning "persona" in that while Auden is expecting you to read this
poem with an awareness that the language is artificial and false, or harkens
to some other time, he's not framing it as a recreation of a particular
voice. I don't think he's pushing this as some sort of naturalized idiom,
it's a little too weird for that. Therefore one is forced to consider the
meaning of its artificiality in a sort of open--ended way, or how the
particular sentiment he seems to want to put across works most effectively
in some rather bogus metrical and lexicographical -- or maybe symbolic --
realm, something alien to our "normal" way of speaking or using language.
Anyway, Bernstein's recent writing in ballad and other forms seem to find
some sort of predecessor in this kind of writing.

Hey, found this on the internet:

The Boy Soprano

Daddy loves me this I know
Cause my granddad told me so
Though he beats me blue and black
That's because I'm full of crap

My mommy she is ultra cool
Taught me the Bible's golden rule
Don't talk back, do what you're told
Abject compliance is as good as gold

The teachers teach the grandest things
Tell how poetry's words on wings
But wings are for Heaven, not for earth
Want my advice: hijack the hearse

Subject:      APOETICS

I'm not certain my last reply went through.  I don't think I clicked
what I was supposed to click within the allotted time frame.  I'm
still new to this.  I wanted to thank Brian for his insightful reply.
But I'm still having a problem with this audience thing.  Okay, the
list members, for example, may know what they like.  But that's not
the same as a poem being validated via formulae (e.g., the New Yorker
stuff).  On what basis does this new audience validate, if there are
no laws governing the method (if there is a method)?  Does writing
out of theory guarantee quality?  Are we even concerned with quality?
Perhaps qualification is an outdated conceptualization.  But then what?
Is everything worthy?  If so, then once again the market place is
da thing that will sort it out, since the Norton Anthology does not
offer infinite space.  Yes, I am talking about posterity, the space
that Charles Bernstein and Jackson Mac Low seem now to occupy.  But
of course there are models; there are formulae for what we do.  And
what we do can be taught, and is.  I suppose this is what I mean
when I wonder if we're guilty of bad faith when conceal how intimately
we're connected to the things we criticize.

What's the contradiction?  That those two poets have "incompatible"
aesthetics?  If credibility means always saluting the same ideological  spot
on the wall, then consider me incredible.  I am pretty incredible, actually.

I don't like Hecht much (anymore) or what he stands for poetically either,
but I'm not going to denounce someone who sees something of value in his
work for that reason alone, and _especially_ if that person also sees the
value of Guest.  Maybe there could just possibly be something we're missing.
  Or not, but jeez anyway.

"shimmering ontologies of transparency"

accordingly, shifting, looking around, coming to mind, intervalling, dia-
gramming our always-already-having-disappeared, entering into knowledge of
our ghosthood,

|   dream / real / constituted virtual / the gnawing of dark matter
|    - symbolic - imaginary - idiocy of the real (practico-inert)
|                          imaginary / as if
|                              imaginary

this is the ontology of transparency, the veering among dream and real,
among the constituted (programming virtual) and the pervasion of parti-
cles and dark matter. and this is also on yet another layer and yet
another interpenetration, a veering among the symbolic and imaginary,
coupled with the idiocy of the real. and on yet another layer, the as-if,
opening into the troubled problematic of the infinite, veering through the
imaginary - and yet, on still another, the imaginary, as if there were,
as if an itself, as if we were dissolving, constantly, within our very
constitution ...

so moreso, the desire to be transparent as well, already-ghosting against
earth and sky, already in the process of dissolution, emptiness to empti-
ness, slight translucency at the edges, peripheral shadows - both towards
eternity, both towards death.

and towards lassitude, languor, the transparency of reception, opening.
and that recognition that we may have been elsewhere-born, hardened,
weighted with the world, foreclosed - and here, opened, delicate, we can
hardly believe it.

''How are we to find a path through the discordant landscape of modern
formations of knowledge? What coherence might we find between the
mutually contradictory visions, ambitions, and  procedures that make it
up? My work makes the wager that an ecology of practices might  point the
way. When I approach such questions as the status of the of physics, the
debates on self-organization, or the challenge to the "great divide"
between modern an
d "archaic" forms of knowledge launched by contemporary ethnopsychiatry,
I address myself to the practices from which the formations knowledge
arose. No unifying framing of knowledge can demonstrate that the
physicists' neutrino can coexist, for example, with the multiple worlds
mobilized by ethnopsychiatry. That coexistence nevertheless has meaning
independent of the question of tolerance and inaccessible from a posture
of skeptical disenchantment. It is only in space of cosmopolitics that
these beings may be affirmed together. This is the space of encounter
between hopes doubts, frights and dreams that elicited and brought them
into being. Through an exploration of our forms of would like to invite
the reader to join in an endeavor of ethical experimentation.' --Isabelle
Stengers (adapted from the Preamble to Cosmopolitics)

 'Isabelle Stengers remains unimpressed by domination, whether it arises
from the sciences or from social powers. At every juncture, she seeks
sources of invention that have been overlooked.'

Ed Hirsch?  My god.  HOW TO READ A POEM AND FALL IN LOVE WITH POETRY must
haunt you ceaselessly.  I'm submitting a film idea to my hollywood friends:
character wakes from troubling dreams, the agreeable yellow cover of HOW TO
floats above him; elongated, meanacing windows of various chain stores
appear; quick shots of his face, terror; he runs down a street; the
floating cover follows!; he ducks down an alley; pamphlets attack him
around the neck and shoulder; he slumps unconscious; cries and shouts;
police come running; body lies prone among printed matter; a passing taxi;
oddly familiar face looks from the window; quiet voice-over, rising in
volume: "Read a poem to yourself in the middle of the night. Turn on a
single lamp and read it while you're alone in an otherwise dark room or
while someone sleeps next to you. Say it over to yourself in a place where
silence reigns and the din of culture--the constant buzzing noise that
surrounds you--has momentarily stopped. This poem has come from a great
distance to find you . . . "

I don't mean this belligerently -- it just seems there's a conversation

I don't particularly share the admiration of Hecht -- but -- I'm all for
wild swings, myself, & I don't know that 'aesthetic credibility,' whatever

Taylor Brady wrote (among other things):

"One thinks of the problematic aspects of Kerouac's reception of jazz, as
if the writer who often made the loudest claims for "spontaneity" in
verbal art, conscious of his own less-than-total commitment to the moment,
his "corrupting" habit of reflection and revision, had to stage another
sector of his society as the performance of the "authentic" spontaneity to
which his rhetoric aspired."

This is exactly what I was thinking of:  the spurious projection of some
fantasy of "spontaneity" onto jazz. I obviously didn't enter into the
subtleties of this music, and I'm glad someone else has done so, more
eloquently and knowledgably than I could have.

I remember hearing Coleman Hawkins 1939 Body and Soul as a young kid. When
my father told me it was made up on the spot I took this way too
literally.

1. I had never heard the song "body and soul" before.

2. I had never heard Coleman Hawkins play anything else.

3. I had heard very little jazz played.  In fact, I assumed that jazz
music had ceased to be played (this was the 1960s!). I was pleased to
learn later on that I was wrong.

So I had absolutely no context to judge the improvisational nature of the
solo. Now I listen to this piece of music very differently, but with equal
amazement and admiration.

of and prevailing social conditioning of reading audience to individual=
 reader.

        The amount of these future emotional flows is uncertain

Poetry is not same as Accounting, not same as Finance

- Finance tries to maximize value, not accounting profits
- Accounting and Economics de-emphasize time and opportunity cost
- Accounting strives to measure and express historical events
- Finance looks to the future using data from the past

To achieve harmony

There must be at least one despicable inflow=20
and=20
one outflow of stuffed wonderfill (sic.)



you must compare emotion flows from similar points in time
How to compare?=20
POETRY AS AN INVESTMENT

Future emotional value=20
amounts to poem as investment=20
to grow after one or more periods earning some given rate of interest
=20
Basically all this means is that if you put poetry under your mattress or
buy into thought as investment, you will earn and your investment, over
time, will grow.=20

First, how much poetry will you have after 1 year?=20
You'll still have your Keats and you'll be able to eat from it tomorrow=20

earn interest on that amount at 8%
=20
After three years of course you will have=20
Keats x (1.08) x (1.08) x (1.08)=20

You begin to see a pattern here!=20

FV=3D PV (1 + i )^N
=B7 FV =3D Future Value of poem read today
=B7 PV =3D Present Value of poem in front of you=20
=B7 i =3D the emotional rate per period=20
=B7 n=3D the number of compounding periods=20

Note: Every timeline must have an inflow and an outflow.=20
That means one of these factors (PV,FV or i) needs to be negative.=20
(Look at it from bank perspective               =09
Elliot's folly =20

So - can you make a decision now? Which do you prefer?=20
suppose we compare both amounts today rather than=20
10 years from now.=20

HOW WOULD YOU CHOOSE YOUR WORLD ?

When you compute future values, you're asking questions like:=20

        How to free a muse=20
        Nothings going to change my world =20

[Timeline]

Present value calculations enable the poetry=20
one needs to be deposited today=20
in order to have a target emotional amount n years from now.=20

Present Value becomes the value today of future emotions=20
discounted at some interest rate calculation=20

future value is just the opposite.=20

The process is of computation and the interest rate used is called the
discount rate
=20
So, if you want to know=20
how much you have to invest today=20
to reach a life like Thoreau=20

look at the problem this way:
=20
We know that for every poem we read today, we will earn annually on those
emotions =20

Suppose you invested in Keats today=20
would you expect its themes to haunt=20
your lungs those 10 years over

At what annual interest rate would you be earning?=20

Before performing calculations,=20
intuition should tell us something=20

                        Multiple Emotion Flows:=20

All emotions compound thereby forming a construct discounting periods are
not annual interest rates are usually quoted on an annual basis, but you
need to know how often interest actually compounds to make correct
calculations =85

Continuous Compounding:=20

Banks, Libraries, and other academic investing institutions often quote
continuously compounded interest in which the compounding period is
infinitely large.=20
Can't use former calculation when m =3D infinite!=20

A perpetuity is a special case in poetry=20
        that all authorship strives=20
It is a stream of thought
bound to incidental words seeking       finding         becoming        constant=20
continuing forever=20
tenderly                        down hallways

Since a perpetuity has an infinite number of meaning=20
we cannot easily compute its value by discounting Keats one measure=20

The formula simplifies to a formula as such:
e APR -1
(e =3D 2.718 - basis for natural logs)

InflaTioN iNcreAseS cost oVEr TiMe

Something that costs $100 today may cost $103 next year.=20
If you invest your poetry at 8% interest rate your poetry grows by 8%.=20

If, however, inflation averages 8% over that same period,=20
you have not increased your power by 8%,=20
you have just kept pace with inflation.=20
If you had not invested your poetry=20
and instead kept it under the mattress,=20
your words can buy 8% less=20
at the end of the year due to inflation.=20

So it is important to invest your poetry=20
to at least keep pace with inflation=20

at a minimum=20
and beat=20
if possible
inflation=20
As time goes on,=20

Time turns its back=20
on Maturity.=20

upon lesser criteria are decisions made=20

  Just to be a little contentious with respect to the fragment below
from Brian Clements, let me say that margins shift and are always in the
process of shifting, perhaps not with respect to the New Yorker but
certainly in connection with such poetry-centered rags as APR.  While
the content of APR is by no means radically leading edge, the overall
valence of the work in the magazine reflects trends that are exerting a
gravitational pull on the mainstream, so that in the current issue
(March/April 2000), for instance, you find on a the back cover a poem by
Lewis Warsh ("Ten Years"), on pages 3-5 inside the front cover, a
selection of pieces by Anne Waldman from "Marriage: A Sentence," on page
9 an essay by Ira Sadoff on the work of Barbara Guest, Alice Notley, and
Jean Day, and on page 13 two poems by Rae Armantrout.  And didn't Katy
Lederer have a poem on the back cover about a year ago?  It's easy to
whip APR for its many failings, but perhaps its better to pay attention
to it as an early indicator the new torsions re-configuring the
mainstream.

    The new Lambda Book Report (March 2000) contains a
    review of Jaimy Gordon's novel BOGEYWOMAN (Sun & Moon
    Press, 2000).
    =20
    Dyke Closet Cutter
    Reviewed ty Terri de la Pena
    =20
    Ursula Koderer, adolescent daughter of a mother killed in a train =
wreck and a world-famous magician father, is the maddeningly imaginative =
title character Bogeywoman. Set in the 1960s, Jaimy Gordon's surreal =
novel combines the teenaged angst of CATCHER IN THE RYE with the humor =
and tragedy of GIRL, INTERRUPTED and ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST. =
Yet despite similarities, there is no definite comparison to these =
classics because BOGEYWOMAN focuses on a lesbial mental patient. After =
she physically attacks a lecherous handyman at Camp Chunkagunk, "Tough =
Paradise for Girls," the authorities discover carved maps on her =
forearms. Her father then confines her to Baltimore's Thomas Hare =
Rohring and Eugenia O. Rohring Clinic, an expensive facility commonly =
referred to as "the bughouse."
         Bogeywoman is a cutter with her own code words. Men are =
"fuddies," psychiatrists "dreambox mechanics," breasts "momps," and =
girls "girgoyles." At the clinic she hangs with The Bug Motels, a rock =
group composed of fellow patients: druggie Bertie, narcissist Dion, =
anorexic Emily, and nympho "O." Bogeywoman herself is "unbeknownst to =
everybody" (i.e., a closeted lesbian). For a year and seven months, she =
keeps silent in sessions with Dr. Reinhold Feuffer (Foofer), her =
dreambox mechanic. At the arrival of the mysterious Dr. Guliam Zuk, =
Bogeywoman senses an attraction to the new doctor and is at last willing =
to communicate.
         Jaimy Gordon effectively captures the insecurity, =
incomprehensibility, and peculiarity of the adolescent lesbian mind. As =
a former "unbeknowst" during the early 1960s, I can remember the =
unrelenting bewilderment of those unhappy teenage years. Whether or not =
this novel is autobiographical does not matter; Jaimy Gordon's skill =
convinces the reader that he or she is listening to Bogeywoman's =
intense, first-person account.
         Though her code words can be off-putting at first, the =
tenacious reader will soon learn to marvel at them, realizing that they =
represent Bogeywoman's alienation from the world at large. Bogeywoman =
soon learns about Baltimore's stark class distinctions, illustrated by =
the characters of Reggie (the Regicide), an African-American attendant =
at the clinic, and from two junk dealers, Tuney and Chug (the =
ayrabbers). The chapter that brings Bogeywoman together with Tuney and =
Chug, however, makes for unpleasant reading because of the black men's =
stereotypical dialogue and exploitative sexism. With Bogeywoman's =
growing infatuation with Dr. Zuk, the novel plunges beyond the clinic =
into the "Dismal Swamp" of foreign intrigue. Without giving away the =
plot, I admit to losing interest at this point. Regardless, I remain an =
admirer of Jaimy Gordon's fertile imagination, inventive =
characterizations, and above all, her insight into the burgeoning =
lesbian sensibility of a 1960s-era teenager.

I'm passing this along to whoever might be interested. It is a letter
concerning the recent "Millennial Gathering of The Writers of The New
South" at Vanderbilt. You might want to reference their web site:

www.vanderbilt.edu/news/writers2000


**********************************

A Letter of Protest:
"A Millennial Gathering of The Writers of The New South"
Repeats Old Habits of Exclusion


Are the writers of the New South simply the same old same old?  What
does it mean when a major southern institution-Vanderbilt
University-hosts what it advertises as "perhaps the most significant
gathering of Southern writers in more than 65 years =85 to examine the
state of Southern literature" and excludes an entire range of innovative
writers of the New South?

Of course, there are many Southern traditions-many worth affirming and
remembering; many worth examining and changing.  Segregation,
xenophobia, apartheid, and the silencing of those who are viewed as
different (or, perhaps, as potential "troublemakers" or "rabble
rousers") all have a well-established history in the South.  We assume,
though, that these are not the particular traditions being celebrated at
"A Millennial Gathering of The Writers of The New South."  Publicity for
the gathering suggests an inclusive, broadly-based consideration of
writing in the New South, when in fact a whole range of innovative
poetries are excluded.

The particular category of writers you have deliberately excluded is
that of experimental writers.  To learn more about this varied writing,
begin with two issues of the New Orleans Review.

The Summer 1995 issue featured "The Other South: Experimental Writing in
the South" (edited by William Lavender) and included fifty-two pages of
work by twenty writers.  In that first collection, in "Toward a New
Southern Poetry," one writer wondered, "what might a new Southern poetry
be? =85 What would it be to think, and write, not steeped in nostalgia, a
poetry not of memory but of the conflicted fragmented multiple
not-yet-clarified present?"  The writers of the Other South have
dedicated themselves to exploring new modes of expression, indeed to
make a writing that is of the New South:  "The challenge today is for
Southern poets too to write in a boldly exploratory manner, to construct
a poetry more attuned to the complexity of our actual location and the
hybridized flux of this moment.  To express and fashion the present in a
poetry equal to the strangeness and multiplicity of the present, and to
do so with a Southern distinctiveness that is discovered rather than
inherited or predetermined."

Over the past fifteen years, there have been a number of noteworthy
books and poems by poets of the Other South, including Hank Lazer's
Law-Poems (a series of poems which incorporate sections of the Alabama
Legal Code; the poems are included in Doublespace: Poems 1971-1989
[Segue, 1992]); Jake Berry's ongoing epic poem Brambu Drezi (Book 1,
1994 from Runaway Spoon Press; Book 2, 1998 from Pantograph Press); some
recent publications of Lavender Ink, including Joel Dailey's book Lower
48; Camille Martin's two books magnus loop and rogue embryo; )ohn
Lowther's .1; Tedd Mullholland's Says; Randy Prunty's Van Gogh Talks;
James Sanders' Haikus for Chuck Woolery; Mark Prejsnar's Burning Flag;
and various writings in a range of innovative journals such as
MISC.PROJ, syntactics, The Experioddicist, itsynccast, 108, and moria.

Please note that this letter of protest-of the aesthetic segregation
practiced by the organizers of "A Millennial Gathering of The Writers of
the New South"-is not simply a whining that asks "why wasn't so-and-so
included."  Indeed, that too would make sense.  One might look at the
gathering with an eye not toward noting the absence of innovative poets,
and one still might wonder why many other writers with very important
perspectives on the South are not participants.  Where, for example, is
Honoree Jeffers (recipient of a major national prize for her first book
of poetry), or C. D. Wright (whose poetry is tremendously important to
any sense of southern poetry and whose Lost Roads Press has been a
crucial source for important new writing-such as Frank Stanford's
poetry-for nearly thirty years), or more traditional writers such as
John Gery or Jeanie Thompson, or the wonderfully complicating and
instructive "southern" poetry of Biljana Obradovic, or Buck Downs (whose
poetry began in Louisiana and continues, both as poet and publisher, in
Washington D.C.), or Bob Grumman (whose Runaway Spoon Press is a major
source for innovative, challenging writing), or Harryette Mullen (born
in Florence, Alabama, and a longtime resident of Texas), or Lorenzo
Thomas (a member of the Umbra group and a longtime resident of Houston),
or the Atlanta Poetry Group (APG), or the writers associated with the
electronic journal Mudlark, or a performance-oriented poet such as Tony
Bolden, or the poetry and publishing of North Carolinian Jonathan
Williams (whose publishing house, Jargon, has been crucial to Black
Mountain Poetry and to a range of important modernist and post-modernist
poetries), or, indeed, to speak about a more local instance of neglect,
what of the poetry and TV shows of (Nashville) writer Joe Speer?
Perhaps many of these writers were invited to participate in the
Millennial Gathering but were unable to attend.

But this letter of protest takes a more specific focus: why have you
chosen to silence and exclude a wide range of innovative poets who have
spent many years writing and publishing on precisely the kinds of
questions that a conference such as yours seeks to address?  Perhaps the
voodoo-gnosticism of Jake Berry would disturb and expand your genial
Roundtable discussion and Conversations on Faith?  Or, those of us who
have stayed home and worked hard to be heard might not be in harmony
with the tone of the Roundtable on Why We Want to Go Home Again:
Conversations on Place?

The second issue of the New Orleans Review, "An Other South:
Experimental Writing in the South, Part II," extended the initial 1995
collection considerably.  This time-in the Spring 1999 issue-44 writers
presented 150 pages of new work.  Again, the special issue was edited by
Bill Lavender.  In his introduction, he wonders "Why is the South the
only region that is also a genre?"  And he points out that "rather than
a region or a community of writers and readers, 'Southern writing'
defines an institutional policy."  In the case of "A Millennial
Gathering of The Writers of the New South," that policy is one of
exclusion.  In one essay of the second special issue of New Orleans
Review, "Kudzu Textuality: Toward a New Southern Poetry 2," there is a
sharp critique of the narrowness of the Norton anthology of Southern
Literature, even as the essay-writer (and the other writers of An Other
South) wonder quite openly about the changing nature of regionalism
itself in a more globalized, electronic world of communication and
publication.

Like the Norton anthology, the Vanderbilt gathering erases and silences
the writings and voices of An Other South.  In the case of the
Vanderbilt gathering, what's particularly galling is that the event
plays on notions of the New South while repressing an entire range of
innovative Southern writers.  As the author of "Kudzu Textuality"
concludes, we are "asking that a broader stylistic range and an
innovative necessity be granted as essential, especially if our poetry
is to be pertinent in expressing the complexities, collisions,
contradictions, and persistent traditions of the present."  The poets of
An Other South have been very much concerned with new modes of
regionalism, with New ways of writing the New South, and with the
changing definitions of who or what is a Southerner.  Collectively, our
writings and presence would have perhaps enlivened and enriched the
Vanderbilt Millennial Gathering of The Writers of the New South.

When the 47 writers of the New South gather for the scheduled porch
sitting, please remember to send some hush puppies to the back door.
We'll be there (in spirit if not in person)-perhaps not as quiet,
polite, and grateful as we ought to be.  We'll continue to talk, and
write, and publish.  And we'll continue to think through the complex
questions of the New South, and about how best to develop new ways to
write and to embody the diverse, multi-faceted, changing present in the
South.  We will not, however, be told that we aren't allowed on the bus,
or that we must ride in the back of the bus.  Or, if we are given that
message, we will not go silently.

Enjoy your three days of (in the words of your promotional material for
the event) "good old Southern hospitality" and "porch sitting."  But
please drop the claim that you represent The Writers of The New
South-cuz it just ain't so.

SEMINAR DESCRIPTIONS

Charles Altieri     English     University of
California, Berkeley
Modernist Experiments and Structures of Feeling: This
seminar will concentrate on how and why modernists break
from established grammars (practical and aesthetic) for
dealing with affects.  What models can we propose for
interpreting the changes attempted and what languages of
value become available for and through those
experiments?

David Brownlee     Art History     University of
Pennsylvania
Modernism and Post-Modernism in Late Twentieth-Century
Architecture:
This seminar will explore the periodization of
post-World War II architecture, with an eye to
distinguishing its modernist and anti-modernist
tendencies and to defining "architectural
Modernism," both as a stylistic descriptor and as a
constituent of broader cultural patterns.  The seminar
will be loosely affiliated with research now being done
in the Architectural Archives of the University
of Pennsylvania in preparation for a retrospective
exhibition on the work of Robert Venturi and Denise
Scott Brown, scheduled to open at the Philadelphia
Museum of Art in 2001.

Jessica Burstein     English     University of
Washington
Fashion and Modernism: We will investigate the exchanges
between fashion and literary aesthetics; artistic
modernism and histories of fashion or design.  Focus
could be on clothing, periodicals like VOGUE (American
or British), or literary representations of the
sartorial. Larger issues may concern high and low
culture, representations of the clothed body,
and sartorial aesthetics.
Invited participants: Jennifer Wicke and Jane Garrity

Anne Charles     English     University of New Orleans
Sapphic Modernism: This seminar will apply some of the
key concerns in the field of lesbigaytrans/queer
literary studies to the Sapphic Modernist critical
enterprise in order that we may, while recognizing
the limitations of the formulation of literary
constructs, discover and describe features that might
constitute "Sapphic Modernism."
Invited participants: Diana Collecott and Cassandra
Laity

David Chinitz     English     Loyola University–Chicago
Modernism, Poetry, and Culture: What historical forces
have held these terms apart?  How can a  "cultural"
approach to modernist poetry animate close textual
analysis, and vice-versa? What happens when modernist
poetry is viewed through a culturalist lens?

Michael Coyle     English     Colgate University
   and Bernard Gendron     Philosophy     University of
Wisconsin–Milwaukee
Modernism and Jazz: What happens when we conceive of
jazz as a distinctly modernist art form: what are the
relations between jazz, in its many forms, and modernism
(literary or otherwise), in any of its various
constructions?

Marianne DeKoven     English     Rutgers University
Postmodern Modernism: How has postmodernism both
actively and retroactively reshaped our understanding of
modernism, through critique, redefinition, suppression,
resuscitation, retrieval, refunction, reconception? how
does this revisionary postmodern modernism continue to
change with shifts in postmodern preoccupations?

Laura Doyle     English     University of Massachusetts
Race, Modernism, Modernity: How does post-Enlightenment
modernity emerge through racialized
encounters/narratives and give rise to a modernism
symptomatic of that history?  Possible topics:
disjunctive splicings of canonical/sentimental with
"folk"/subaltern; politics of insistently non-modernist
practices; modern self-knowing and modernist, racial
self-fashionings; racial panopticons/passings; diasporic
modernist urban epics.
Invited participants: Phillip Brian Harper, Peggy
O'Brien, Radha Radhakrishnan, Marlon Ross

James English     English     University of Pennsylvania
Modernism and Prestige: This seminar aims to explore
modernism in relation to various forms and hierarchies
of cultural prestige.  How was prestige distributed
among the arts and among individual artists and
authors during the modernist period?  What critical
approaches today offer the best route into these issues?

Simonetta Falasca-Zamponi     Sociology    University of
California, Santa Barbara
Fascism and the Avant-Garde: This seminar will explore
the relationship of the intellectual and artistic
avant-gardes to fascist culture and politics.  Why were
so many avant-garde figures attracted to fascism?
And should they be evaluated as "fascist"?

Norman Finkelstein and Tyrone Williams    English
Xavier University
Diaspora: Exile, dispersion, and the loss of homeland
and cultural roots are some of the most common,
devastating, and (ironically) inspiring experiences
represented in modernist literature and art.
  We invite papers on all aspects of diaspora as it
manifests itself in modernist thought and cultural
production.

Nancy K. Gish     English     University of Southern
Maine
   and Keith Tuma     English     Miami University
Languages and Legacies of Modernism: "Britain" and
Ireland: Recent alternative poetries point back to
neglected modernists like Brian Coffey, Lynette Roberts,
and Veronica Forrest-Thomson, and to diverse
experimental forms.  How can we read the work of such
precursors beside contemporary poetry and canonical
modernism?
Invited participants: Alex Davis, Romana Huk, Steven J.
Matthews, and Peter Middleton

Mary Gluck     History     Brown University
Modernism and the City: Why is the city the most
frequently evoked context for the modernist project?
What is the relationship between modernism and the city,
considered in its multiple guises as the social spaces
of the modern metropolis, the aesthetic spaces of the
urban text, or the cultural spaces of commercial mass
culture?

Eileen Gregory     English     University of Dallas
Models of the Classical in Modernism: Modernism and
classicism are deeply affiliated. A political and
philosophical as well as literary act, classical
appropriation suggests complex genealogies–with
decadence, Romantic hellenism, Augustan humanism,
Renaissance hermeticism.  This seminar considers models
and genealogies operative within modernist writers'
citation/translation/revision of classical texts.
Invited participants: tba.


Linda Dalrymple Henderson     Art and Art History
University of Texas
   and Bruce Clarke     English     Texas Tech
University
Modernism and Science: What roles did science play in
the development of new forms of art and literature in
the first half of the 20th century?
This seminar invites papers on modernist artists and
writers who drew inspiration from science before and
after Einstein.  We are particularly interested in
methodological issues: how does one make valid
connections between these two areas of cultural
production?

Gail McDonald     English    University of North
Carolina at Greensboro
Feeding Modernism: Food (and drink) in modernism.
Possibilities:
cookbooks as manifestos, the role of cafés,
modernization of food technologies, literary depictions
of eating, food fashions and fetishes.  Also food and
the politics of colonization, wartime scarcity and
rationing, food as status-marker, food as entertainment.
All disciplinary approaches welcome.

David McWhirter     English     Texas A & M University
Modernist Abstraction: The varied modalities, histories,
and politics of formal abstraction in modernist
literature, visual arts, film, theater, music, dance;
examinations of individual works/movements, particular
formal structures/mechanisms, and/or key critical
terms/constructs.  Interdisciplinarity encouraged.

Cristanne Miller     English     Pomona College
Crossing Boundaries in the Arts: Cross-fertilization and
international exchange played a crucial role as the arts
reinvented themselves for the twentieth century.  How
did
modernist poetry absorb and transform innovation from
visual arts, music, film, and photography?
Invited participant: Bonnie Costello

Robert Morgan     Music     Yale University
Coherence and Incoherence in Modernist Literature, Art,
and Music: In what ways do modernist artists forge a
dialectical relationship between coherence and
incoherence in their work? For example: How do they
respond to the seemingly conflicting claims of
uniqueness and universality?  How do they combat
incoherence in pursuit of such modernist traits as
difficulty, complexity, and  inclusiveness?  Papers
on any aspect of the issue, dealing with any artform(s),
welcome.

Carol Oja     Music     College of William and Mary
Spirituality and Early 20th-Century Modernism:
Intersections between alternative spiritual writings of
the early  20th-century–especially those connected with
theosophy–and modernism. With certain American
composers of that period, these belief systems provided
a way of rationalizing musical experiments.  This
seminar will consider that tendency as found among
creative artists working within a broad spectrum
of art forms and in different countries.

Brian Richardson     English     University of Maryland
Modernism and the Reader: Relevant topics include
modernism's implied reader(s) and their roles, gender
and reading, hermetic texts, minority audiences,
characters as readers, queer reading, film and theater
audiences, excluded readers, postmodern readers and
rewriters, misreading, re-reading, unreadability, etc.
Invited participants: David Kadlec, R.B. Kershner,
Patrocinio Schweickart

John Paul Riquelme     English    Boston University
Modernist Orientalism: Theories and Interpretations:
This seminar will focus on theoretical contexts for
interpreting modernist works with attention to the
exotic and on representations of the exotic in British,
Irish, American, and European art and literature from
Gerome and Wilde forward.

Luca Somigli     Italian    University of  Toronto
The Genres of Modernism: What is the function of genre
in modernist literature?  Issues include: the rise of
new genres; the influence of the other arts and the new
media; the recuperation of popular genres;
the relative symbolic capital of different genres.
Invited participant: Michael Coyle

Leon Surette     English     University of Western
Ontario
Literature and Economics: An Unholy Alliance?: Papers
are invited on all aspects of relations between the arts
and economic thought–from the radical right typified by
Social Credit (and Modernism) through the conservative
middle typified by Keynes, to the radical left typified
by Marx (and Postmodernism).
Invited participants: Hildegard Hoeller, Alec Marsh

Denise Von Glahn      Music     Florida State University
Futurism: This seminar will consider the relationship
between Futurism and Modernism, and explore the ways
Futurism manifests itself in music, art, and literature
in the United States and Europe in the early decades
of the twentieth century.

Wallace Watson   English   Duquesne  University
Modernism and the Movies:  Likely topics for discussion:
the participation of cinema in early twentieth-century
literary and other artistic avant-garde movements;
modernist strategies in postwar European new wave
cinemas; commercial considerations; adaptations of
modernist fiction.
Invited participants: Peter Christensen, Carole Dole

Barrett Watten     English     Wayne State University
   and Rachel Blau DuPlessis     English      Temple
University
Avant-Garde and Cultural Studies: Have cultural studies
methods led to an exclusion of avant-garde social
formation and works of cultural production, generally in
favor of mass cultural forms? What elements of
the avant-garde participated in the formation of
cultural studies methods, and in what ways ought their
legacies to continue?

        There's an old saw that says, "biography is a murder,
autobiography a suicide".
        (Interesting to think on "an old saw .  . . says"--as though some
time patinaed vision spoke from amidst the dust--from dimmed sight to
hoary breath)

        There's a way of writing which is literally
cannibalisation--Artaud, Nerval, Rimbaud, Kerouac etc etc--flesh and
nerves consumed and gesturing through the flames--
        The only way to write might then to be to continually reinvent, or
to raise from the dead, the writer (oneself)--Burroughs saying he wrote as
a way to remain alive.
        Revision or not revision seems really to be a question of limits
and
possibilities.
        Olson, as Creeley noted in an essay, noted that one lives within
limits, yet the limits are what makes one aware of and make use ofthe
possibilites at
hand within those limits.
        So when a revision is done, or not done, that is a way of setting,
for that particular set of possibilities--a limit.
        (What Robert Smithson called a "container", nothing that "if art
is to be art, it has to have limits".)
        When revision continues, this a way of extending the possibilities
of any given bracket within the set--so that it may multiply and exfoliate
into several--
        as series,

        (For example, zum beispile, und so weiter.)

        (An Example: LEAVES OF GRASS in its various editions--culminating
in
the Death Bed Edition.)
        (Various works by G. Stein, R. Grenier, J. MacLow, C. Coolidge)

                (Not revision, but serial)

        "the only thing that changes is the will to change"--Olson

        whose will? the writer's or the writing?

        (accidents will happen)

I'm just wondering, forgive my spotty reading lately, but did someone argue
otherwise? This seems quite obvious. Didn't Kathy Acker, for one, speak of
an Other tradition that included Burroughs, de Sade, I don't know other
prosoids?

Does any group or thing get away with not turning itself into a cliche
ridden stereotype, esp looking from w.o?

ps some mfa programs offer training in both 'experimental' and those other
values/trads.

        dear friend Don Cherry, who played many years with Ornette used to
say  " only a supremely disciplined musician can play Free Jazz"--
        knowing limits of the form, of the discipline and working off of
those to their possibilities
        in reggae, dj, dance hall and dub there's "version"--taking the
bass roots so to speak of the piece and variating and playing off it--
        a simple experiment you can do with a record collection is just
tape all the different versions you have of a standard
        say, "Gloria" or "Hey, Joe"
        or hundreds of blues and jazz pieces
        (ever run into collectors of bootlegs--every version of a Dead
song ever done? etc)
        Kerouac was, as noted, maybe not truly spontaneous--certainly
there is often as he notes the fact that the work is written after the
fact, and what he is improvising on is more the sounds that occur to and
from him as he writes the later 'reflection" on the experience--
        even his books of poems, spontaneous bop prosody, are shot through
with memory which is evoked by the present scene--
        his ability as a writer is not the kind of spontaneity that one
assumes (which may or not exist at some level anyway)--but is built out of
memory, dream and the time lag and jump which occurs as the distance of
language from the object presented--
        the problem, as Robert Grenier has said,, is in the two
propositions set
forth by W. C. Williams:  the early "only the imagination is real" and the
later "no ideas but in things, Mr."
        Larry Eigner noted that a poem is taking a walk, which extends
itself--in serendipidy--
        spontaneity is not the source itself, but comes from an encounter
with the source--come across--

Subject:      Richard Kostelanetz's Dictionary of the Avant-Gardes
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

A few days ago I finally got my contributor's copy of the second
edition of Richard Kostelanetz's Dictionary of the Avant-Gardes,
now out in an impressive hard-bound copy published by Schirmer Books,
which recently became part of Gale Publishing (the change-over is
presumably why it took me four months to get my contributor's copy).
Richard was kind enough to let me contribute a few entries, mostly on
poets I had criticized him for leaving out of his first edition like
Karl Kempton.  I had also criticized him for not doing justice to the
language poets, by whatever name, and this time around I'm not sure he
did much better.  He didn't change his dismissive entry on Charles
Bernstein--or, if he did, he didn't change much of it--not that he
probably needed to, except to mention Charles's tv-stardom.  And his
entry on "Language-Centered Poetry" is short and more about Richard's
view of the language poets as an exclusive club than an aesthetic
analysis of language poetry.  But each entry has a fairly extensive
bibliography, and this one is no exception, so one can readily go from
Kostelanetz to more favorable commentators.

I wrote no entries on language poetry or poets, although Richard
told me I could write entries on anything I wanted to.  I didn't
feel I knew the field well enough too--and we didn't have much time,
so I concentrated on my pet poets (but still left out at least two
dozen of THEM I think should have been covered).

I really think the dictionary a genuine attempt to cover all the arts
mostpeople could reasonably consider "avant-garde" or "experimental"
or "innovative," et cetera.  Richard should be commended for what he's
done to overcome his personal likes and dislikes for fairness's sake, at
least about whom and what should be discussed in his book.  While there
is much in it I disagree with, as there would have to
be in any such dictionary, including one I were sole editor of
(since I do occasionally disagree with myself), I find it really
funful and informative--perhaps the best thing Richard has done
as an arts-sage.  Of course, ad hominists will say that's only because
I'm part of it--but they'll be wrong.

It's too expensive, I would think, for most personal libraries,
but I hope some of you will think it worth telling your local library
about.  It's $75 from the publisher.  For details (and an absurdly
philistine list of selected entries that mentions hardly one subject
that you couldn't find adequately covered in any mainstream
encyclopedia), go to:

                   http://www.mlr.com/schirmer/index.html

The dictionary is a perfect argument-starter of the kind that Marjorie
Perloff appears to be saying critics should engage in, though she
herself doesn't seem to.  Marjorie has no entry in the dictionary,
incidentally, nor is she mentioned in its (unthorough) indexes although
her name pops up in several places, including the entry for "academic
critics."

I'll be glad to answer any questions about the dictionary that I
can--and take on anyone who wants to attack any of MY entries (which
include ones on "infra-verbal poetry," "burstnorm poetry!" and
"mathematical poetry").  I'm certainly willing to put in my two cents
about almost anything else in the dictionary, as well.

                                                    --Bob G.

Hey, be nice!  I was 18 yrs old for Chrissake.  In fact, we should all be
more aware, perhaps, of the fact that the huge majority of young people
out there interested in poetry and attending colleges have no idea of
what's out there beyond the land of NORTON -- when I began teaching at
Wheaton College last Fall (coincidentally, its in Norton, MA) and began
supervising senior theses in Creative Writing, my conversations with
students tended to go like this:

Me: Have you read Harryette Mullen?

Student: No.

Me: Have you read Gertrude Stein?

Student: No, but I think I've heard of her.

etc.

This is no knock on the students, who are generally pretty bright.  The
point is, they have no access to information.  It's also worth saying
though that this can change rapidly, particularly in a small department -
and between me and a new professor named Claire Buck (who wrote a
dissertation on H.D. and knows her way around experimental writing) the
landscape here changed but quick.  I usually find young college students
pretty open-minded and, I mean, given the chance, will *any* of them
really choose Ed Hirsch over, say, Susan Howe in the long run?  Provided,
that is, that they have access to the books and the discussions
surrounding them?

I am pleased to announce that rumors of the demise of Poetry New York have
turned out to be premature! The issue that was to go to press soon will
indeed go to press but with a small delay. PNY's new Editor is Shawn Vandor.
PNY's address remains the same: PO Box 3184, Church Street Station, NYC
10008. We do not as yet have an official PNY e-mail address or website but
we will before long.

If you have questions for Shawn--he will be handling the day-to-day
operations of the magazine--then please e-mail him at
shawnvandor@hotmail.com; but, if at all possible, please give him a couple
of weeks to settle in.

I will be contacting contributors individually, who have written or phoned
me, about this good news. Yet I'd appreciate it if you could spread the
word.

One thing anyone slated for the new issue might do soon, though, is to send
Shawn a 'permission to publish' statement specifying the work accepted for
the issue. Tod Thilleman did not turn over to me all letters of submission
and/or letters granting permission, if he ever had them, and Shawn and I are
wanting to be thorough about everything.

Thank you for your patience during this anguishing transition,

Burt Kimmelman, Senior Editor

you will have a complete collection of everything i have written
nothing will be held back, nothing will remain unknown
my world is given to you, pull the theory out, assemble it
it is all there, the defuge, sexuality, transparency, linkage, coupling
the theory all there, just barely virtual in the life of nikuko
in the life of julu, the theory resides, within the life of jennifer
oh azure, my other lovers are not real, they are make-believe and mine
theory emerges, all will have all of it, my most solemn promise
no other truth is necessary, you have my complete collection
now, you have everything, this is the very last text for now
this is the very last text, at the moment nothing else
be content, hold steadfast, comprehend, receive and surrender
my promise is fulfilled, my world rendered, all revealed, perfection
promise given, residing, emerging, holding, comprehending, and surrender

Thanks to all who came out for my April 9 reading at the Cornelia St.
Cafe.  The room was packed.  Thanks also to those who bought books.
I've noticed that too many who attend readings do not buy the author's
books.  We should support each other's "hard  copies."  Since Cornelia
charges $6 admission, it was wonderful to see an appreciative
audience  springing for more.

I agree with Joe Lucia's assessment, and would venture that Colorado Review
might not belong on Brian Clements' list, either. They've published Lyn
Hejinian, Cole Swenson, Spencer Selby, Barbara Guest, Geoffrey O'Brien,
Lisa Jarnot, and a number of off-center poets in recent years. True, it's
not exactly Sulfur, but it's not The Sewanee Review, either, and like APR
it demonstrates the very real (if tardy) lapping of experimental tides into
the lagoon of stylistic complacency that Joe describes. Jorie Graham is
CR's poetry editor, and while I'm not inclined to inhibit the recurrent,
venomous waves of Jorie-bashing that surface often on both this list and
others, it's obvious that she at least reads experimental work (witness the
nods to Michael Palmer, Susan Howe, and others acknowledged in Swarm),
perhaps more avidly than most of her institutionally validated peers. (I
should add that I have no ulterior reason for coming to CR's defense; after
an e-spat I had with the editor over one of his editorials, my work is far
from welcome there.)

...Can we say there is no improvisation, there is improvising?...
And improvising practices are mindful practices as thoughtfully aimed
articulational reaching. There seems to be no end to ways for characterizing
the "structure of an improvisation," given the possibilities of
terminological revision, theoretical reclassification and structural
analysis. But the action essentailly escapes descriptive attention. If it can
be said that I "do improvisations," it seems it must be asked: how do poetic
thoughts behave so as to produce "improvisational appearances" for a material
examination by all the talk about them.

Best,
Gerald

someone answered with Harry Matthews. I'll add that I think it's pretty
common throughout Oulipo. Was the phrase "canned phrases" or something,
the idea being it was an instance in which you could readily hear the
original and see/hear/know immediately what had been manipulated?

All from memory on this, pardon inaccuracy. Go to the Atlas Oulipo
Compendium, which is a great thing to have around.

Some on this list have no doubt heard about the conference, Expanding the
Repertoire: Continuity and Change in African-American Writing, held by Small
Press Traffic here in San Francisco over the weekend. Others of you were
there as well, and I hope will provide reports, critiques, extensions, etc.,
of your own. I know "scene reports" can often be tedious for those not
connected to the scene, but the scope of this conference - geographic,
generational, aesthetic, political, historical - warrants, I think, some
serious discussion in this space. Unfortunately, time constraints intervene
on my end once again, so what follows will not _be_ such a fully-committed
discourse, but perhaps one version of a starting point that might become
one.

I should start by thanking, again, the conference organizers, Renee Gladman
and giovanni singleton, for having the idea, coordinating the panels and
framing the questions, and doing all the unglamorous and exhausting work in
between. Thanks as well to Jocelyn Saidenberg and the volunteers, board
members, and supporters of SPT.

In rather schematic form, then, here's what happened. (Quotes are from the
relevant reader/panelist, unless otherwise noted, and are often approximate,
though I attempted to be as accurate as possible):

___________________________
 I: Friday evening, group reading
___________________________

Will Alexander leads off with his essay on African history, prehistory, the
epistemological issues raised by such - a venture perhaps toward an
Afrological (George Lewis' term) poetics. The essay, by the way, was
published in the "History" issue of Ribot, for those who want a look of
their own. Alexander's inimitable range over vast fields of vocabulary here
takes a different turn, into a more discursively-sited prose, but with
similar range over fields of information, data, context. Poems follow, and
immediately I realize the condition that will plague me throughout the
conference - sheer joy in hearing and the documentarian's desire to get it
all down run too often at cross-purposes. Every now and then, pen finds
paper and I get a bit of it, while keeping an ear cocked for what comes
next, "...like reading, within a smoldering interfixation, a treatise on
locomotion." His reading ends with a poem whose title, most sadly for my own
selfish purposes, I didn't manage to record, whose speaker/speech-center is
a sea-captain in the _eastward_ African diaspora. Recent conversations with
Tisa Bryant about the African cultures of the Indian subcontinent ring in my
ears around the "translocated ember" of Alexander's poem. "Fire in the form
of entangled isolations" - a departure even when read against the context of
massive departures, but context entangles still. Something here about how
these multiple lateral displacements, and displaced displacements, across
geography and culture model Alexander's own insistence on a "vertical"
displacement, a climb into the "ether" (his word from Sunday's panel) along
which the category-laden, sociological cant of the faux-empirical social
text gets productively lost, but which height remains a height in and of
historical practice. A moving text, in the best sense of that word - a word
which could as well be applied to most of what transpires at the conference,
but I'll drop it in place here and trust list readers to imagine the ripples
spreading.

Wanda Coleman, introduced as the "high priestess of poetry," follows.
"American Sonnets" and other poems - languages of political resistance both
discursive and bodily and points between, music, sex, etc. Throughout all an
insistence on the body and voice of the performer prevails, in gesture,
contortion and flexing of facial muscle, words inflected up into the
speaking equivalent of a falsetto, down to a deep basso rumble. I overhear
Coleman some time later, commenting on her platform style, and maintaining
forcefully that this is not a "representation" of emotion, not an expression
of the poems' content per se, but the concrete result of what she calls
"frustration" in trying to find a way to say them, make a public action of
their language. That the performance _be_ such an insistence upon action
finds its reason, the formation against which its work is arrayed, as the
languages come together, sex and music and violence and death and the short
con and the various long marches, etc. "All this crypt-kissing going on" -
LA as America's love of death, celebrity tombs and the mediated languages
that burn them into us as the image of desire by which "we" get burned, in a
landscape subject itself to various burnings and counter-burnings. Which is
where it ends, the book thrown down - whether in disgust, frustration,
inability to go on, etc., left for the hearer to decide - as Coleman walks
slowly from the room, "Fire!" repeated all the way from shout to mutter out
into the hall and through the front door to Valencia Street.

C.S. Giscombe is next, remarkable for his grace under the alphabetic
pressure that puts him after Coleman. And here I note the flexibility,
responsiveness of the audience - everyone is right there with him, extremity
of the transition in dynamics notwithstanding. That the poems he reads,
especially the new ones from a series called "Prairie Style," are so
wonderfully complex and interlocking as to seem paradoxically open, rolling,
is perhaps part of the reason. I don't want to make too much of the
"naturalness" of these poems - they're some very seriously "worked" serial
poems, repetitions and etymological redispositions keeping things in a state
of provision for new eventualities. But the need to approximate the
condition of an upper Midwest, largely rural landscape and its political
occasions in terms of an African American presence, an artist's presence,
and the "absent presence" of human contact necessitates a certain approach
to that condition of "flatness": "the return was aloof itself"...."it got
flat that deep in." And that's the trick - really no trick at all, in these
tremendously sincere (_not_ earnest) poems - by which one hears the series
flowing easily along the mind's tongue, so to speak, only to realize, at odd
and unexpected intervals, how the ease of one's following has been
instrumental in building a maximally uneasy treatise on place and its lack,
in the face of which one ends up tongue-tied; how the ease of the inner
speech, as which these poems have sounded in one's head, has been complicit
in the undoing of ease, its return to what it smooths out in order to appear
thus easy: "At first I thought that being visible and silent was a context
of its own."

After the intermission, we're back with Erica Hunt, whose presence at the
conference has been something of a highlight in advance for me, as I've read
her work enthusiastically for some time, but always managed to be in the
wrong town to hear her read it. Even given these inflated expectations, the
reading itself does not disappoint - in fact opens up new spaces for me in
relation to her writing. Pieces from Local History and Arcade come first,
and speak in their complexities to some of the anxiety produced by a
recurrent theme of the conference, an "innovation" part of whose novelty
lies in its qualitative departure from the scales by which one or another
discipline, one or another canon, has measured its own sense of progress: "a
whole new category of police will have to be invented." What I like
especially about the staggered deployment of such ironies in Hunt's work is
the way their ensemble effect is neither simple reassurance of agreement and
foreclosure of debate, nor the self-lacerating posture of much
post-"movement" rhetoric, which signals its own complicity with the objects
of its critique only by way of an admission of defeat inflated to "literary"
proportions. The new work is especially good at this negotiation, noting in
one particularly funny piece the way in which "the come-ons of appliances in
the marketplace," commodity fetishism in particularly amplified form,
stroking the machine bodies in furtive acknowledgement of a consumption
going far beyond use, can become a site within which to note the movements
of the otherwise muted or channelized desire and labor that produce the
domestic. This sense of a multiply-contradictory set of historical logics,
within which a program remains possible, an "opposition," to use part of the
title of Hunt's best-known essay, informs her panel presentation on Saturday
as well. (See below).

The evening ends with conference organizer and poet giovanni singleton, who
starts with part of a visual poem derived from the Library of Congress call
numbers of books by conference participants, among others.  What follows is
an engaging mix of anecdote, short lyrics, and two longer sequences,
"Melanin Suite (for Alice Coltrane)" and one new and ongoing (?) series,
whose title I let slip, but which begins with a great story about riding a
limo in the casual carpool. (The significance of this to non-NoCal folks
might be lost). Other high points came in the poem from her series for
painter Buford Delaney (sp?), an investigation of what might be said in the
language of line, mass, and color, how abstraction might take root in the
quotidian and the historical. I hope someone else will fill in for my lack
of specifics here - pen went dry at the end of Hunt's reading, and I gave in
to the possibility, three hours into the event, of letting it wash over me.
Much in there was worthy of discussion - it would be great to have some
citations to work from. Anyone?


Alright, that will have to be all for today - much work still to be done, of
the paid variety. More tomorrow on Saturday's panels and reading, and the
final panel Sunday morning.

It's not the idea of jazz that matters most to me, not the idea of
improvisation, or anything else. Jazz matters to me because it is the most
successful art I know. Listening to jazz, great jazz from Louis Armstrong
to Cecil Taylor (at least), I always have the feeling of the artist
creating his (her) own freedom right here, right now. As long as I'm
playing I'm free. As long as we're on this bandstand, we are free. That's
the feeling I get from jazz. It's not just in the great solos, certainly
not just in jazz that breaks this or that musical rule. I don't know what
it is. But I find it nowhere else, and I want to learn how to get there in
poetry. (I think we're on the same wavelength here, Mark.)

***

One of the things that bothers me about Kerouac's theory (can't speak for
the practice) is that there is a split and that split can lead to a
confusion. K's idea is the undisturbed flow of writing, no selection, no
self-editing, no pause for reflection, etc. The writer is to take dictation
from his own mind, and give that mind plenty of room to create without
worrying about the process of recording. So there's Kerouac the mind at
liberty and there's Kerouac the unobtrusive recordist of that mind's
thoughts, etc. What goes wrong I think is that Kerouac sees how crucial the
discipline of unobtrusive recording is to create a space of freedom for the
mind to create, but then he forgets that there are TWO processes, and he
transfers the virtues of unobtrusive recording onto the mind that creates
what is recorded. ---- I really shouldn't even cast this as a critique of
Kerouac's "theory", I just want to look at the ideas. It is not the
recording per se that is so important, but what is recorded. Rudy Van
Gelder is not Sonny Rollins. He was a genius at what he did, but what he
did was record not play. Thank god for us there have been recording
geniuses to bring us the music. But the music is something else. I think
it's a little harder to keep the distinction clear when it comes to writing
since the two functions are combined usually within the same person.
("Usually" b/c I was just reading the other day Perelman's account of
experiments with dictation he & Kit Robinson & Steve Benson tried in the
70s, some reading some typing all that.) ---- And it's worth keeping the
distinction clear because sometimes being a camera or being a mirror or
pure recording micro-states of consciousness or whatever is put forward as
a goal, so I'd want to distinguish that from ideas that are really about
process.

***

Poetry presents challenges to conceptualization that I don't think we're
anywhere near meeting. When I read about jazz, these musicians have, to
start with, the whole vocabulary of conventional music theory. Now I don't
understand all this stuff, but it's obvious to me that poetics is
impoverished by comparison. A jazz musician might say, if you're soloing &
you hit the wrong note, go to your chromatic. We don't have that kind of
vocabulary. Or when you talk about individual styles and technique, it's
not just that Brownie was Brownie, but he had his own way of tonguing
pitches that other trumpeters can study & practice and use and expand on.
That's another kind of vocabulary we lack. Everything seems so much vaguer
with us.

Hello List,

a friend of mine (Dragan Espenschied) and me developped a net project
called "Assoziations-Blaster" being online for more then one year in
german language. It's an interactive text network with real time linking
and contains more then 30000 user contributed texts related to about
3000 keywords.


Now, we have created an english version; we invite all to visit
http://www.assoziations-blaster.de/english/ and to contribute some texts
or ideas.

The project is strictly non-commercial. And the new English version is
still very fresh and empty. We are searching for people that are
interested in experimenting with this text machine. The fun starts as
soon as there are regular contributors. We already have a "fanbase" in
Germany using our Blaster for experimenting with writing and linking
tecniques.


To get an impression how the blaster can develop, you can visit the
german statistics page: http://www.assoziations-blaster.de/statistik/



Here a small announcement, we posted in some newsgroups:

Well said, Joe. I agree --- not because I think APR deserves more credit,
(or aesthetic credibility) but because while the polemical indictments of
mainstream journals made in the 1980s were a necessary intervention, the
grounds on which those indictments were made continue to shift.

I didn't see this comment of Brian's, but I doubt he's actually looked at
The Iowa Review either, unless it's with eyes that only see what they want
to see.

Joe Lucia's point is well taken. APR does seem to be widening its horizons.
I suppose they've been hinting that way for some time, but I think it's
still just that--a hint.

The inclusion of these writers suggests that APR may be doing a better job
of being the AMERICAN Poetry Review rather than the ACADEMIC Poetry Review.
This opposition of the academic and what lies outside the mainstream is
artificial, of course; the two cross-pollenate and interact. But the fact
remains that there is a strong corelation between academic writing programs
and who gets published in mainstream literary publications. WJA's question
was about how work gets judged, and I'll repeat my contention that it's
senseless for a community whose work occasionally appears in APR to look to
mainstream critics and editors for affirmation. For the folks writing in the
community that tends to frequent this list, I'd contend that work is
measured at least partially in open peer-review. The methods and critria for
review are probably not much different from those in academic
circles--they're simply informed by different ideologies (from the
mainstream and from each other) and they have different (though not
necessarily less-read) outlets from the mainstream.

As Lucia's post suggests, we seem to be progressing towards a point where
those two communities (mainstream and outside-mainstream) are beginning to
converge. I think that fact is largely due to things like this list and the
plethora of online publications which make publishing (and READING) poetry
mroe open, more available, and more interactive. My hope is that we will
continue to see this convergence until the use of terms like "academic" and
"experimental" as oppositions is senseless. On the other hand, who wants a
world of straight fives? Is the appointment of Creeley to AAP board and
MacLow's subsequent award a harbinger of synthesis to come or simply an
anomaly?

As to how quality is judged in the sub-community, I would say just as it is
in the mainstream--by the readers. By the quantity of readers and by the
quality of readers; by the subcommunity readers, not necessarily mainstream
readers, not the market of the whole, but the market of the part. If you
want to get into specifics of quality judgement, it seems to me to be a
matter of surveying the readers, which I suppose you're doing by posting the
question here. It's an interesting question and I, too, hope some others
will address it.

OF INTEREST:

GENDERNAUTS, Monika Treut´s Journey through Shifting Identities,
opens at the Lumiere Theatre in San Francisco on April 7th with daily
screenings. (California at Polk)

The stunning portrait of Brandon Teena, BOYS DON´T CRY, may have brought
the predicament of transgendered people to the attention of the film
viewers only recently, but German filmmaker Monika Treut has spent many
years chronicling the lifestyles and politics of this group as well as
other sexual non-conformists who tear down stereotypes and taboos in her
many documentaries including FEMALE MISBEHAVIOR, DIDN´T DO IT FOR LOVE
and feature films including SEDUCTION, THE CRUEL WOMAN, THE VIRGIN MACHINE
and MY FATHER IS COMING.

Treut´s newest film GENDERNAUTS takes her to the Bay Area of San Francisco
where she introduces us to San Francisco´s leading gender mixers.
Treut records the stories of hormone treatments, love lives and lifestyles
with performance and video/web artist Jordy Jones - who created a website
devoted to Brandon Teena in 1997; Sandy Stone, self-proclaimed "Goddess of
Cyberspace" and author of "The War of Technology and Desire at the Close of
the Mechanical Age", who along with author and transgender expert Susan
Stryker provides an academic reference point for the film. Interviews with
video artist Texas Tomboy and webdesigner Stafford give insight into the
day-to-day lives and creative expressions of the group. Ex Penthouse
centerfold model Tornado, who has been a lover to some transgenders and a
surrogate mom to others, and sex goddess Annie Sprinkle explain their
long-standing support of transgender people. We also meet Hida, an
intersexed woman, who happily inhabits the middle ground between male and
female.

GENDERNAUTS was awarded with the Special Teddy Award at the 1999 Berlin Film
Festival; with the audience award at both the Turin International Film
Festival and the Mix Brasil Film Festival in Sao Paolo.

VARIETY calls it "surprisingly accessible....informative and non-threatening
pic will play well to just anyone brave enough to buy a ticket."
VANCOUVER SUN gave it 4 stars and calls it "Treut´s boldest statement to
date" and New York`s TIME OUT claims "your eyes will be opened to some
intriguing possibilities."

GENDERNAUTS, 86 minutes, 35mm, color, 1999, Dolby, English
World Premiere: Berlin International Film Festival.
Written, directed and produced by Monika Treut,
Production Company: Hyena Films, Hamburg, www.hyenafilms.com
Cinematography by Elfi Mikesch.
With Sandy Stone, Texas Tomboy, Susan Stryker, Max Valerio, Jordy Jones,
Stafford, Hida Viloria and Annie Sprinkle.

Thanks for your reply, G.  But I don't think I've missed what you say
I've missed.  The market place, as I think I make clear, is not
simply a matter of dollars.  So much for Jewel.  I am referring to
the market place of serious art and ideas, their currency, reach,
and preservation--and most important for this discussion, their
qualification.  My point is simply that, if there are no formulae
for, say, language poetry, then acceptance becomes the sole criterion
for worth--whereas the New Yorker stuff, whether or not a specific
poem achieves wide spread acceptance (even if it never gets published)
may be judged worthy on the basis of certain rules of quality.  Of
course, as several listers, including me, have pointed out, there
are formulae for established "avant garde" works, and individual
works may be judged by them in a workshop.  I have, indeed, encountered
language poets who have claimed that their work transcends, or at
least escapes formulation.  I don't think that's accurate.

**************************************************************************
LAST WEEK: How to describe the last reading...surreal, edgy, dis-easing? No
words can really describe it. The tone was set with the oddly soothing music
drifting up from the downstairs gallery, where an ethereal rock band was
playing. This required the audience to concentrate extra hard to decipher the
poets' words. JOE MASSEY was the Delaware conundrum. After Greg gave an
introduction charting the difficulties he had in pinning dow this mysterious
man, Massey himself, in all his heft, reached the podium and delivered some
incredible, spare, introspective verse. He then proceeded to baffle the
audience with his responses to questions, including the infamous 'slutty
Pomeranian' comment. Needles to say, Joe has a dog issue. ABIGAIL SUSIK was up
next. She was charming. Her reading was a mix of lyric work and some fantastic
choral poems, for which she employed the services of fellow poets & classmates
Nate Chinen (down form New York), Matt Hart & Heather Starr. Inexplicably, the
music stopped during these pieces, and the music of the multivocal poetry took
over. We then adjourned to the most outrageous Cajun dancefest for Frank
Sherlock's birthday party. Selah.

DAVID KIRSCHENBAUM has been described by poet Drew Gardner as an
"impressario." David earns this title by being a dedicated and consistent
purveyor of small press publications, which come out under the aspices of his
BOOGLit press, based in New York City. The last issue of BOOGLit magazine was
a Jack Kerouac special. The next issue is dedicated to Baseball.

DAISY FRIED is the hottest poet in Philly. Her newest book is to be published
by U. of Pittsburgh press, a good press. She's read all over the city, and has
participated in past Fringe Festivals, with her husband Jim Quinn.

Well, of course.  Does anyone really think that the mainstream is
something completely other.  The mainstream is nothing else but a
record of experimental work, institutionalized.  What have we been
saying about inter-textuality for the last 20 years or so?  The
mainstream is not supposed to be cutting edge, so it's sort of
silly to attack it on that basis.  I don't want it to be cutting edge.
Where would that leave us?  The concept of "experimental" would
be decommisioned.  The mainstream is, at least in part, a museum.
And what painter, or sculptor, in his heart of hearts, doesn't want
to end up in a museum, and change that museum with his/her presence.
Since Mac Low and Bernstein have been so thoroughly accepted by
the mainstream, I'd say that avant garde word since the 1960s is
walking in the front door.

Subject:      visual poetry--Bob Grumman!

Hi, Bob Grumman!  Been a while.  Why not more attention to visual
poetry?  you asked back in March (and I just read that portion of
the archives).  Okay, I'm going out on a limb here.  A stab in the
dark because, really, I have some time on my hands and I feel like
guessing.  Could it be that those with clout have some difficulty
distinguishing between visual poetry and collage paintings.  I know
not every vp fits the mold, but many do appear as just the sort
of sketches the great collagists (?) made before they created the
fully realized canvas.  Do these things belong in poetry books,
or in galleries?  The commingling of poetry and painting is an old
trick.  Perhaps what we want is for the po-biz to accept the thing
the way the painting biz has.  Would that make it new?  Or just an
old thing moved to a different building?  As you know, I'm in the
early stages of a book on Kosti (because I like his work).  Much
space devoted to his visual poetry (much of which I enjoy).  I'm
not anti vp.  I'm just wondering.  And I'm also wondering who wrote
the Book of Love!  But that's another story.

For my money, Richard's work is at least interesting, at most
kick ass.  I recommend anything that comes out of that warehouse loft
of his (or is that warehouse eyes?) in Soho.  My own complaint is
that the bit on deconstruction misses Derrida by a mile.  But that's
not surprising in an America that has bastardized Derrida beyond
recognition (of course, Jacques could have said something sooner, but
he was busy counting his money).  Anyhoo, it's a small caveat on
what is a very long road.  Yay Richard!

The Poetry Center is pleased to announce the launch of a new online
literary journal entitled Narrativity, located at The Poetry Center's
website (http://www.sfsu.edu/~newlit).

Editors: Mary Burger, Robert Gluck, Camille Roy, and Gail Scott.

To quote the journal's editorial statement:

"Narrativity is intended to supply to supply a form of nutrition now
missing:  the articulation of ideas about theory-based narrative. We hope
to provide a meeting place in which writers develop a critical discourse on
uses of narrative in their own and others' work."

"The first issue includes work by Kathy Acker, Lawrence Ytzhak Brathwaite,
David Buuck, Jacques Debrot,  Jeff Derksen, Rob Halpern, Laird Hunt, Trevor
Joyce, Kevin Killian, Chris Kraus, Rachel Levitsky, Pamela Lu, Nicole
Markotic, Ashok Mathur, Laura Moriarty, Lisa Robertson, Leslie Scalapino,
Juliana Spahr, Anne Stone, Michelle Tea, and by the editors.  It includes a
forum.  Reader participation is encouraged.  We anticipate publishing twice
a year."

It seems you are assuming the appropriateness of classifications which

The point is that "visual poetry" is NOT "commingling of poetry and

 Perhaps what we want is for the po-biz to accept the thing

Taylor, I am so glad you began. (I was waiting for someone else to.)
Immediately I am very intrigued with Wanda Coleman's thoughts on the lack
she sees in poets reading their work sort of non-deeply-performatively. I
like many tend to hide behind the page and feel crispy when I think I've
appeared too vulnerable "on stage". But my companion mentions (he's a
singer) that it's always the shows with some screw-up felt by him as
performer that touch or move people enough to say anything to him. (If touch
or move make you cringe, how bout DO ANYTHING?)
Just one reason I was glad Coleman was part of things, to bring in another
bent to poetry than is usually involved...where? here? I don't know.

As for audience participation, I very much appreciated Tisa Bryant's
notation that things blend across all sorts of boundaries (and sometimes
create new ones, I'd add -- thus my statement of WC's work being somehow
'different' than some of the other panelists/readers -- which is altogether
an overblown statement and I apologize.) I teach poetry so am constantly
brought out of my deepest agreements with myself in regard to it, at least
insofar as needing to explain them to others and to be, again, open.

This is turning too meme. I also appreciated your, Taylor, comment on the
lack of work both critical and mostly critical here, being done by folks who
would love to do more but who are stuck at academia's bumpy edges, bumper to
bumper between community colleges, and your call to change the institutions.
(Tell me when it's done, please ;))

Moving into the main portion of what I saw -- I was only in attendance on
Saturday -- I have to point to Mark McMorris's talk in the "Kindred" panel
which was very thrilling for me -- his assertions about what makes
avantgardes happen (boredom, for one) and his amazing notations of ways in
which syntax works and doesn't and works otherways. Also Erica Hunt's
comments on how to read the past and find the things you need. And on WW2 GIs.

I will close because my lame paraphrasings are frightening me, and it's
late. I hope others will write in and I heard a rumor that some of the talks
will be printed in one poetics journal or another, and I very much hope they
are, as I would like to read them more slowly, and others need them too, and
I feel very lucky to have been there.

Thanks Renee, giovanni, Jocelyn, Kevin, Dodie and everyone. Eliz.

PS I have to add that Nathaniel Mackey's comments about teaching tugged at
my heart- and head-strings. He said it is an occupational hazard to be at
work seeing the evaporation of literacy and students who have trouble
dealing with the most denotative poems, then coming home trying to
push....poetry. further.

oh it tugged at my heartstrings.

I wait for others to speak. Eliz.

This to take place on the UC Berkeley campus, in 13 Boalt Hall (halfway
between Telegraph and I-House, just off Bancroft Way). The hosting
organization is the Canadian Studies group. The event, which is free,
begins at noon and will run for approx. an hour. A+bend press just
published _Authenticizing_ , and I shall be speaking about this book and
reading from it.

The larger book of which _Authenticizing_ forms the 4th part is "As in 'T'
as in 'Tether'," to be published later this year. This book was begun
during a residency at U.Brit.Col. in 1996, and started out as a series of
involuntary memories (in the section called "Initializing") of the years
either side of 1960; I was then an undergrad there, but these memories
emanate from everywhere.

These poems make a history and a reading of that history. _Authenticizing_
starts with a knifing & concludes with a kidnapping. The theme of
imprisonment (in  language, in false consciousness, in the flesh) shares a
moebius strip with the theme of community sought through these same agents.
Each poem is a dream and a waking : "Poetry the theory of heartbreak."

Forgive the clumsiness of this description. Its relation to the poems is
problematic. This kind of inequity troubles them also, but they exist for
that alone, whereas this prose has designs upon the reader. I hope some of
you will be able to attend, and even anticipate a colloquy.

Taylor,
Great job recapping the first evening of the Expanding the Repertoire
conference!

Like you, and anyone who's ever attended a conference, I too faced the
opposing objectives of recording and listening, so my notes are sparse, but
like yours (I hope) significant.

I am still synthesizing/processing/gasping/marvelling over the conference
myself; it was a tour de force, a great effort by Gladman, Saidenberg and
singleton, and a first, as none of the authors had ever been in one room
together at once.  I certainly hope it won't be the last time.

The name of the last poem Will Alexander read was called "The Sri Lankan
Laxodrome".  I'd heard him read it once before, but was glad he read it
again, since the subject  has been on my mind since my trip to India.

The one word that comes to mind when I think of the conference is
generosity.  Everyone gave so much of themselves.

I want to say more about Wanda Coleman's AMERICAN SONNETS, but I'll save it
for later.

C.S. Giscombe was some cool water after Wanda Coleman's fire, with his
"chunky lyrics, Prairie Style", his sly red foxes/Redd Foxxes moving across
and through.  But the Coleman anecdote you offer, Taylor, has me
investigating the terrain of writing and reading what one writes as a
sustained frustration.  An interesting succession, Coleman's increasing rage
at the inadequacy of the spoken word, and Giscombe smiling softly at/through
his.

Erica Hunt seemed to combine the two who preceded her into a coy but somehow
unassuming, philosophic, political and mischievous persona, her look while
reading "Madame Narcissist" from ARCADE.  I so look forward to the
publication of her new work, especially the series on United Laboratories
testing processes, and one woman's fetish for appliances.  I don't think
I'll look at my toaster in quite the same way again.

giovanni singleton's concrete poems are amazing; if you haven't seen them in
Chain 6, take a look.  Some meticulous work.
But *hearing* one (a much too tiny bit during her time at the mic) read
aloud by her is something else all together.  The concrete became sound,
just like that.  Before reading, she said that some of the Library of
Congress card numbers belonged to books of authors present for the
conference, and asked that they stand up when they heard their number.  I
only wished I had done a little homework, put authors and titles to those
numbers, so I could have stood up for someone not there in the room, in the
anthologies, on the shelves, in print... I still can.

Especially since "quality" in two circles seems to be tied to
revision/rewriting.  In some writing workshops, for example, revision /
rewriting based on workshop comments is supposed to improve the "quality" of the
work.

In some cases I'm sure "quality" is the degree the poem adheres to a shared
vision of what the poem sh/could be.  In some cases, I'm sure "products" of such
programs seek to internalize this "shared" vision, making it not singular, but
not dependent on external "others", on the workshop "process", etc.

The workshop never sees the revision or later draft or "final", unless it is
published, read, performed, or etc.?

In engineering, quality (tqm) does a few things:  since there are "many cooks"
(as in a workshop), quality is supposed to restore or retain a coherence,
consistency, an "oversight" (a return to a single author?); since there are
versions, too, and tests, perhaps like critiques, it tracks versions in order to
be sure that test fixes (revisions too) and last minute ideas, etc. 1) work, 2)
don't fundamentally change the primary goal of the ... thing.

So rewriting in order to address a shared, multiple, or external vision and
providing "more" coherence, etc., is a quality "refinery".  That certain
journals and certain teachers support each other (common aesthetic and theory?)
indicates they share such a vision (of quality).

Now, some believe that tqm is a boondoggle of enormous proportions, but, then,
others think mfa and phd programs are pyramid schemes.  Why would tqm be a
boondoggle?  It institutes an "author" (or manager) who 1) is not the original
author in important ways, 2) does not necessarily have the technical knowledge
of a cook, 3) compensates for the introduction of the secondary cooks who have
some "say so" (power) -- why not just cut out these, 4) enforces a
consistency/adherence to the primary original goals, which aren't necessarily
proper (these goals are like the results of the first three steps of the
scientific method).  There are other reasons which don't apply to poetry.

I think this is a fascinating issue.  Of course this is the ongoing
complaint of post-classical Western poetics.  From the Elizabethans
complaining about "rude rhyme," "hunting the letter" (alliterative verse)
and the lack of measurable "feet" in English verse as compared to Greek and
Latin, to the more or less elegant acknowledgment and evolution of
stress-based pentameter as _the_ English metric backbone, to the Romantic
complaints about fossilized Miltonic conventions, to the gradual
substitution of new fossilized conventions based on "natural speech" in
their place, to the substitution of disjunctive/paratactic structures in
_their_ place, etc.  What all this points to is the observation that we _do_
of course have such a vocabulary, some terms of which I've just slapped in
there, but no one wants to use it anymore.  Or those who do, like the New
Formalists (bless their souls, the little rebel angels: they look so
peaceful when they're sleeping), want to use it as an official rulebook
instead of what it optimally is--a handy glossary.

Now granted, accentual-syllabic metrics don't offer anywhere near the range
of polyphonic effects that classical quantitative meters do (or pretend to
anyway), but at its height the English prosodic and rhetorical traditions
did lend some useful terms that I think work as well at describing much of
the stuff that Bernstein or Susan Howe or Kenward Elmslie or Brian Kim
Stefans do.  Not _all_ of it, naturally, since a prosody only has a limited
function in the first place, just as the system of scales, etc. only has a
limited function in jazz.  But in both cases, the prosody and the scales
define on a basic material level the sonic (and sometimes semantic, and
sometimes affective) effects of the individual poem/composition/performance.

It's a mistake, I think, to treat prosodic concepts solely in terms of
_forms_ in the sense of ready-to-hand genre molds that you can slap on a
work premeditatedly (though you can do that too if you wish, and sometimes
it doesn't even suck too bad if you're lucky).  Let's take the sonnet, for
instance.  We all know that there are lots of "sonnets" that have more or
less than fourteen lines, that don't rhyme, that don't have a volta, that
aren't real sonnety in the Petrarch-Sidney-Keats sense.  What makes these
poems sonnets is a certain attitude or positioning or context, not anything
necessarily having to do with prosody.  On the other hand, when I read a
poem by Elizabeth Treadwell, say, that doesn't have anything overtly formal
to do with The Western Tradition Before Pound, there are still cases when it
might help to talk about an astute deployment of trochees (for example).
Even if she didn't _mean_ to do that, or didn't attach that particular
definition to it while she was doing it (although if she were going to do
that, she would certainly have the term in mind, being quite versant in
classical stuff as it appears).

Now, an obvious shortcoming of all this is that jazz is in some way purely
sonic, and the talk of scales, chromatics, etc. more or less encompasses
that sonicness, whereas poetry is only partly sonic, and the talk of metric
or rhythmic effects only addresses that aspect of the art.  Still, it's an
important part of it, I think, and I'm not sure that it would _hurt_ any
poet to become fluent in prosodic terms, just as it wouldn't _hurt_ any jazz
musician to learn the scales (maybe some arguments there, I dunno).  And a
lot of the time it would help, a lot--have you ever read a poem you liked
deeply on a lot of levels, but you wished the poet had devoted a little more
time to sound?  I'm talking about times when it _doesn't_ seem to be the
case that the poet was doing something deliberately inflectionless or
inflectionally arrested, but rather when there seems to be a conscious
attempt at producing a certain sound-music that just doesn't come through.
It's addressing the nature of that certain sound-music that prosody helps
with.  Now it may be the case that those poets aren't going to gain any more
fluency from knowing some technical terms, but then again maybe it _does_
help in getting writers to think more rigorously on the level of sound.

Now, as it currently exists, prosody probably doesn't help _enough_, since
most of its terms are still borrowed from classical poetry with its largely
alien length-based system.  So what do you think?  How many of us
consciously think about spondees or enjambment or tmesis or whatever, and is
it a good idea to do so, or should we think about something else, or just
not worry about it and stay "impoverished"?

Addendum: I'm still thinking of that Ornette Coleman quote from a post a
couple days ago, about it being possible to "make a mistake" within a "free"
methodology.  What kinds of "mistakes" can writers identify in their own
_prosody_ (and how far do we want to extend the domain of prosody: just
rhythm? vowel qualities? semantic connotation?) in various drafts of their
work?  I'll share if others will.

...and maybe enough time today to get through the rest of it. This company
will regret the day they gave me an office with a door, for sure.
Unfortunately, my schedule is running a bit tight, and I want to get this
done before leaky memory renders my notes any more cryptic, so the rest of
the report might run a bit toward the schematic. Again, I hope someone takes
this as a request to fill in the gaps, or contest the way I've framed
things, etc.

(By the way, for those interested in the bibliography, Renee Gladman sent
word yesterday that Will Alexander’s Indian Ocean piece is titled “Sri
Lankan Loxodrome”).

______________________________
II. Saturday morning, panel, “Catch a Fire”: The Role of Innovation in
Contemporary Writing
______________________________

Not enough sleep - one never gets enough sleep at these weekend-long
things - but we’re here early, setting up chairs and PA system, still
charged from last night’s reading. After Renee's introduction, which,
technical glitches aside (and the lost second page of the intro serves
actually as a wonderfully non-binding ground of articulation, a place yet to
be made, especially as Renee positions it thus), works well to provide a
sketch of context and articulation between the panelists' projects and
careers, Wanda Coleman begins. Her presentation is informal and anecdotal,
and fairly wide-ranging, so I'll touch on just part of it here, since it's a
focus to which various conference participants return. Using a poetry trade
publication devoted to recipients of major prizes for 1999 (not sure which
publication -- like I said, my notes are cryptic) in which she appears along
with Rita Dove (? -- I think that's right), the two of them bookending
Jackson Mac Low, Coleman sketches an account of the anthologizing imperative
which wants to position writers of color in some necessary kind of
shared-category dialogue. So Coleman and Dove have their poems chosen to
"answer" each other across the divide of Mac Low, as if it made sense to
(and here I'm paraphrasing Coleman, but it's fairly close) "Let the two
Black women appear to talk to each other, whether or not there's any
relationship between their works." What emerges is a fairly clear sense of
how the insistence on a "dialogue on race" (to go presidential for a moment)
within the liberal-pluralist frame often amounts to little more than a
catechism, especially when it pretends to be an adequate account of acts in
language as complex as poems. Coleman discusses this reduction in terms of
"notation" vs. "performance," both as an account of the way in which the
craft of the poem gets reduced in such a framing, and in which the political
dimensions of that craft get effaced.

Nathaniel Mackey's paper picks up on this sense of what I've heard Anthony
Braxton call the "great trade-off," and which Mackey himself theorizes as a
"division of cultural labor." His squaring off of Olson's "blessed
difficulties" against Langston Hughes' Jessie B. Simple might do well with
some additional unpacking -- surely Hughes' onomastic imperative is caught
in a complex negotiation between a real investment in the simplicity of
parable, and a no less real ambivalence about simplicity as the cultural
imperative handed to many African American writers. But the rhetorical point
is well-taken, as Mackey goes on to consider the way this "division" enters
into the self-descriptions and poetics of African American avant-gardes,
producing, in the Black Arts-period Baraka, for example, an extreme series
of "anxieties over the anomaly he took himself to be."  This leads to the
possibility that what Mackey calls Baraka's "conversion narrative" of the
transition from Greenwich Village hipster to Newark nationalist might
actually obscure or limit a full reading of Baraka's work during that
period. This marks another recurrent theme for the conference, the return to
and re-examination of Black Arts practice to begin assessing whether it
might have been somewhat more multiple than it often appears in recent
accounts, which tend to position the African American "innovators" of the
late 70s onward (people Mackey's age and younger, roughly) as if they were
the first to discover complexity, and as if this discovery were made in
opposition to a Black Arts orthodoxy. At the same time, Mackey's positioning
of Baraka's account of the shift in his practice as a "conversion narrative"
makes another rhetorical move, at once granting the importance of certain
precursor texts in an African-American literary tradition (one recalls all
the mileage literary scholars have gotten from the conversion narratives),
and suggesting that a too-close adherence to their models might be
ultimately limiting.

(For an interesting sense of how a "conversion narrative" might itself
reconfigure the "conversion narrative tradition," by the way, I pull from my
own recent researches Albert Ayler's beautiful, weird, disturbing "To Mr.
Jones -- I Had a Vision," written to Baraka, though still addressing him by
his preconversion name. If anyone is interested, you can find it online at
http://www.gslis.utexas.edu/~jeffs/chpt4.html as part of Jeff Schwartz's
Ayler bio. It's about 3/4 of the way down the very long page).

Harryette Mullen finishes up the morning's panel with further discussion of
the need for a counter-tradition -- which, following my jazz post the other
day, I might want to call _the_ tradition -- of generically and
categorically-unsettling writing by African Americans. For those who
attended last spring's Page Mothers conference, it will come as no surprise
to hear that her discussion of Fran Ross' "lost" novel Oreo figures in this
project. It might come as a surprise, or at least a happy confirmation, that
Mullen has managed to secure a reprint through Northeast University Press,
with a foreword by herself. The book should emerge late this year or early
next (? -- again, working from a memory addled by a very busy weekend and a
very ugly week at work). It's apparent that Ross' novel is particularly
useful to Mullen's work towards constructing a history of African American
literary practice in which adherence to the representation of an "authentic"
vernacular is not the single most important factor. Not that Oreo doesn't,
from her accounts, deal with an oral tradition -- but that it places this
alongside and in contentious conversation with a more bookish, etymological
fixation on lexicon, a specifically written series of puns, and, in the
prominent placement of Yiddish dialogue and narration in the novel,
"another" set of oral and literary traditions altogether. (After the panel,
Mullen and I discuss the late saxophonist and composer Glenn Spearman's
stunning Blues for Falasha [available on John Zorn's Tzadik label as part of
the Radical Jewish Culture series] as another instance of a Black engagement
with Jewishness / Jewish engagement with Blackness in which neither is
approached as simply and univocally "other"). Tempering this insistence on a
polymorphous, polystylistic, polyethnic literary practice is Mullen's own
biographical consideration of her own career, her sense of Muse & Drudge as
a conscious attempt to engage an African American audience and "perception
dynamic" (another Braxton term -- sorry, my own recent reading keeps
intruding), while maintaining her anti-essentialist position vis-a-vis the
preeminence of the vernacular. Again, not that it isn't there, but that it
functions as something other than a marker of authenticity.

----------------------

It looks like that might be all for today. With any luck, I'll have time
tomorrow to summarize Saturday's second panel and evening reading, and the
concluding panel on Sunday.

All best,
Taylor

Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

Hello the listrous,

I've written a pretty thorough report on ISSUE ZERO: THE LITERARY MAGAZINE
CONFERENCE which you might enjoy.  It's on the Poetry Project site &
Jacket's also got it so you can see it in New York
(www.poetryproject.com/ishzero.html) or in Australia
(http://www.jacket.zip.com.au/jacket11/lorber-zero.html). I'd very much
like to hear what people think -- of the report & more to the point, of the
conference.

I remain your big zero,
Brendan Lorber
Editor, LUNGFULL! Magazine
Cocordinator, ISSUE ZERO

In the meantime, here's a snippet of the report's opening:

Thanks to everyone who made ISSUE ZERO: THE LITERARY MAGAZINE CONFERENCE IN
NEW YORK the success it was, who left me exhausted but unwilling to sleep,
with an apartment piled under new magazines & brain pan cooking with the
expansive spirit that many editors pretend they don't really have.  Hunger
seems to be the hallmark of successful magazines:  editors voraciously seek
out new writing & new approaches to language, readers await the next issue
of a journal they dig with a certain anticipatory growl in their bellies.
After the conference, people asked Douglas Rothschild, my collaborator on
ISSUE ZERO, & me if it was going to happen again next year.  We have no
immediate plans, but if the American people insist, we'll see what happens
. . .

If you were among the 30 editors or 150 audience members in attendance
here's a little reminder of what we went through, & if you weren't, well,
we mostly talked about you, but here's what also happened:

One score & ten editors spoke about & from their journals over three nights
March 10-12 (not to mention the kickoff night back in February, where my
notes are sketchier but my impressions no less optimistic).  The conference
took place Friday night at The St. Mark's Poetry Project, Saturday at
Double Happiness & Sunday at Zinc Bar. Despite the fact that everyone at
the conference had, at one time or another, been rejected by someone else
there, the writers & editors were all eager to find out what everyone else
was up to.  Over the three days, the editors' emphasis on what made their
magazines unlike any other in the world, gradually gave way to some
interesting areas in which they were similar . . .


For the rest, including a quick synopsis of each magazine's role in the
conference go to the Poetry Project or Jacket sites....

If I'm not mistaken, in a recent issue of Poets & Writers, Metromania
either promoted the point (or at least reported another critic's
point) that avant garde work (e.g., language poetry) escapes formulation.
It's in a very recent issue which I no longer have.  But it was my
surprise at reading this that got me started.

Metromania has also argued that the Ellipcicists ?(what a silly name!),
by which he means those poets who use avant garde devices but believe
a little goes a long way (since their primary impulse is Romantic),
e.g., Jorie Graham, produce oppresive work when they fail to write
work that does not self-consiciously or otherwise acknowledge the
political conflicts that produced such devices (Whew! What a sentence!)
Guess we'll all have to stop using computers unless we somehow
allude to the cold war in everything we write.  Sheesh!!!

cascading, exuberant in their cross-fertilization of punning and knowing,
theatre and theory." —Charles Bernstein

The Poetry Center & American Poetry Archives
presents

An evening with GAD HOLLANDER
Thursday April 13, 7:30 pm, $7 donation
@ Yerba Buena Center for the Arts (Mission & 3rd Street)
San Francisco

a reading & film screening
presented in collaboration with
San Francisco Cinematheque & Center for the Arts

GAD HOLLANDER is a poet and filmmaker living in London.  *  His latest book
of poetry, and first to be published in the US, Walserian Waltzes (Avec
Books, 2000) is just out--an extraordinary hall-of-mirrors poem-in-prose
revolving around the figure of Robert Walser, the great Swiss-German writer
of "minimal" fictions whose work stood behind Kafka and others.  *
"Neither a biography of Robert Walser, nor a Kafka-in-Queens type of
displacement, Walserian Waltzes is closer to what Borges does with Don
Quixote. . . . a breathtaking tour de force" --Rosmarie Waldrop. *

We'll also be screening his film Diary of a Sane Man (1990, 85 min.).  *
"This poet-turned-filmmaker's first feature-length film (made on a budget,
he points out, for a 15-minute short, using borrowed equipment and
scavenged, odds-and-ends stock) is a serendipitous blend of art and irony,
philosophic reflection, double-edged nonsense, improvisation, mythology,
and the music of Johann Sebastian Bach [performed for the film by pianist
Yonti Solomon]. 'In my mind, the music is the main narrative,' Hollander
states. 'I've been told that this is a typical first feature film because
it has everything in it.  That's true, but only because I wanted to have
everything in it.  I wanted to present a textured complexity.'" (Melissa
Drier, Filmfest Journal, Berlin). *

Gad Hollander was born in Jerusalem, and spent, as he puts it, "(in/un-)
formative years" in Queens, New York.  *  Tonight's event is his first
public appearance in the Bay Area.  *

See, here's the sort of thing that bugs the crap out of me, this is
Perelman in _The Marginalization of Poetry_ talking about Ginsberg and he
throws in this about Williams:

        When Williams writes poems such as "Fine Work in Pitch and
        Copper," which ends, "One still chewing / picks up a copper
        strip / and runs his eye along it," he is equating the copper
        strip with his own poetic line; and thus claiming as unambigu-
        ous a social status for poet as for roofer.                     [p. 116]

The hell he is. Maybe you could convince me Williams was saying something
like this if you showed me the letter where he says, "You know that poem of
mine 'Fine work ...'" but I want to see the letter. Otherwise this is the
same old crap and Perelman's book is full of stuff like this. Is this the
best we can do? Why does this seem like a reasonable way to talk about
poetry? Or anything? There's as much evidence to support this
interpretation as there is for UFOs as the source of civilization. (Guy at
work tells me all about it.) This is what makes me really depressed, that
all we have is this sort of impressionism. It's like what Frank Ramsey
said, that too often philosophy comes down to exchanges like this:

        A: I went to Grantchester yesterday.
        B: No I didn't!

It' worthless. The one thing I've thought of in the last few days that
points in the direction I'd like to see poetics go is Pound's now hoary
distinction of phanopoeia, logopoeia and melopoeia. Now that's useful. But
what have we had since then? Almost nothing.

So I'm ranting, so sue me.

I really love that Williams poem too so it pisses me off to see it treated
so cavalierly. And I just checked, indeed Perelman does have the title
wrong: it's "Fine Work  W I T H Pitch and Copper" not in. Thought I ought
to check before being pissed about that too. Here's the whole thing:



Fine Work with Pitch and Copper

Now they are resting
in the fleckless light
separately in unison

like the sacks
of sifted stone stacked
regularly by twos

about the flat roof
ready after lunch
to be opened and strewn

The copper in eight
foot strips has been
beaten lengthwise

down the center at right
angles and lies ready
to edge the coping

One still chewing
picks up a copper strip
and runs his eye along it

[Selected Poems, p. 107]



What I wonder is Williams equating those sacks with, or the roof, and its
flatness, what does eating lunch symbolize do you think? ---  alright
alright I'll stop

Someone out there please tell me things are not so bleak and tell me there
are great strides toward a real poetics being made even without my help and
beyond my ken! Please!

Pat

III: Saturday afternoon, panel, "Kindred": Origins of the Black Avant-Garde
____________________________________________________________

After a long lunch, we're back for the afternoon panel with Erica Hunt, Mark
McMorris, and Lorenzo Thomas, moderated by Harryette Mullen. Hunt begins,
reaching into her recent work on African-American GIs during and after World
War II for her sense of one of the "origins" named in the panel title. She
speaks to a sense of the brutal push that "four years of constant horror,"
followed by a homecoming to reaction, must have been, in terms of arguing a
need for more self-organizing cultural and political forms. What emerge are
approaches to art and language and social movement that take as ground both
a commitment to African-American identity and a siting of that identity as a
claim on national and world structures of belief, thought, organization. (In
this, of course, participating in the global dynamic of the post-war decade
which Malcolm X once characterized as a "tidal wave of color"). Hunt's focus
is provisionally on music, the radicalization of aesthetic practice in jazz
from bebop onward. She characterizes her own entry into that field as deeply
affected by the musicians of the AACM -- a personal association with
trombonist and electronic musician George Lewis, among others -- and the
example in their practices of a reach across global cultures that situates
African American music and art upon the broadest possible ground. Hunt
speaks of the experience of this music as a realization of "not having to
take sides": again, an argument toward a greater stylistic diversity at the
height of the Black Arts "moment" than conventional wisdom usually finds
there. Even against this background of relative license, Hunt argues for an
eye toward wider and wider horizons: "I mean, I don't want to kick Anthony
Braxton out of the AACM until he's ready to leave." (In a discussion I have
with Hunt after the panel, what emerges is the flipside of this polyvocal,
polytonal approach to art- and music-making: Joseph Jarman and Muhal Richard
Abrams, giving the name "Great Black Music" to this set of multiple
interstices between African, African-American, Afro-Caribbean, European, and
Asian musical, theatrical, ritual and social practices. This is an
insistence that "reach" is not simply the collapse of difference, that there
is in fact the ground to argue for a Black aesthetic and cultural project,
but that this project cannot be reduced to categories of folk expression [at
least not in terms of one kind of "folk"], and the authentic voice, but is
situated in a diasporal reality in which "Blackness" is an ongoing global
event).

Mark McMorris is next, with a tour de force of a paper interrogating what
one might mean by "the African-American avant-garde(s)" / "the
avant-garde(s) of the African Americas." There is a three-way negotiation of
contradictions and differences here, things that remain in solution without
precipitating a sense of simple opposition. On one hand, there is the
possibility that at certain historical junctures the language-practice of
the collective itself might run ahead of what the previously sedimented
"territory" of the language can hold, might make demands for expression that
disrupt the language in much the way a more conventionally-understood
avant-garde art does. McMorris' example here, drawing from a passage in
Eduard Glissant's _Caribbean Discourse_,  is the scream of enslaved cane
laborers, forbidden to speak in the fields and thus reconfiguring the
"inarticulate" outburst to carry information of survival and revolt: "how
the dispossessed man organized his speech by...extreme noise." "Meaning from
the inside, mumbo-jumbo from the outside."  This example produces a
lingering pull against the notion -- which still has its own gravity, to be
sure -- of the avant-garde as elitist, rooted in a declassed European
aristocracy and its hangers-on. Which helps to prepare the "other hand," an
account of the Cesairean eruption, the repeated volcanic moment of
phonological "noise" in the "Cahier" which echoes, in this context, the
field scream. (Don't have the text at hand to cite the spelling of this
spell or invocation). "The fury of Cesaire's poetry cannot be ascribed to an
aesthetic inclination." Of course, here that's complicated by the
countervailing force of those elites mentioned earlier: Cesaire writes in
French, to begin with, a linguistic decision that's wrapped up in a
complicated series of negotiations and struggles over "elitism," "folk
culture," etc. And his "eruption" -- which continues to erupt at odd
intervals throughout the rest of McMorris' paper -- places him in an at
least provisional alliance with current and recent European avant-gardes:
dada and surrealism especially. (And in fact the critique of Cesaire as
overly complicit with an elite, "literary" language, which is also perceived
as the language of colonialism, becomes something of a mainstay for a later
generation's theorists and practitioners of literary creolite [sorry, no
accents]. For a _very_ general introduction to this conflict, have a look at
the interview with novelist Patrick Chamoiseau at
http://caribbean-beat.com/archive/creole.html. That it's much more
complicated than such a general introduction can make clear, though, is the
upshot of this part of McMorris' paper). And then, on yet another hand --
one needs comrades, perhaps, to get through this -- there is the sonnet by
Claude McKay (missed the title -- help?), written out of an earlier return
from war, in which discharged Black soldiers home from WWI were subjected to
what amounted to house arrest, threatened with both legal and mob violence
for appearing in public -- white supremacism masquerading as a concern for
public safety, one of its favorite disguises. McKay's poem calls, in fairly
decorous, "traditional" tones (by Cesairean standards) for collective
resistance up to and including armed defense in response to this intolerable
situation. McMorris raises the useful question whether this introduction of
radically unprecedented content into literary language, this turning of form
to effective "use," might not constitute a different sort of avant-garde
practice, every bit as successful as Cesaire's. Finally, McMorris doesn't
provide any answers to these questions -- "collective struggle or individual
breakthrough?", "ideological intervention or material effect?" -- but
manages to ask them more compellingly than I've heard in quite a while. The
difficulty of siting a successful avant-garde practice on either side of
those "or"s becomes, at the end, a definition of the sincerity of such acts
in language -- "sincerity: the precariousness of the interfering /
intervening poem." (My slash, not his, as my ears failed me at precisely
that point).

Lorenzo Thomas is the final panelist, and speaks, among other things, to a
further exploration of what seems to be the question for the day: "What are
some of the models for a successful African-American avant-garde?" Thomas
points to several instances, among them James Weldon Johnson's
transformation, in a few short years, from the nation's most
highly-remunerated writer of "coon songs" to compiler of spirituals and
author of _God's Trombones_. That these aspects of Johnson's work are often
approached themselves as instances of a "pre-avant-garde" traditionalism
echoes McMorris' concern with precariousness and sincerity. Johnson's
placement of this work into an undecided sense of the "living tradition" of
the popular and folk materials he draws from stages a critique of his own
previous work, and of the broader project of positioning African-American
cultural products as easily "digestible" (Mullen's word from the previous
day) commodities of representation. At the same time, the very terms of this
critique suggest that other such interventions will become necessary --
representations become more complex and qualified over time, perhaps, but
they never quite manage to escape representation, which, in terms of
categories as politically contested as race, nation, culture, etc., is
always going to present new difficulties. Thomas' talk then ranges over a
wide stretch of references, including Clyde Taylor's _The Mask of Art_,
Matei Calinescu's _Five Faces of Modernity_, Jayne Cortez' _A Blue Book for
Blue-Black Magical Women_ (correct title?), the Umbra group, including
Ishmael Reed's "A Cowboy in the Sunboat of Ra," mentioned the previous day
by Wanda Coleman and picked up again here, the Harlem Renaissance, the Black
Arts movement, etc. An interesting claim in this is Thomas' sense that one
achievement of the "successful avant-gardes" he considers -- the Harlem
Renaissance and Black Arts in literature, bebop in music -- has been their
ability to produce from and, in some qualified or unqualified way, back
into, popular culture. This finds a certain resonance with the tensions
operative in McMorris' paper, and, in its expansion to consider
contestations over precisely what terrains of popular culture will be
acceptable material for art practice, seems as well to indicate what might
be a productive divergence between Thomas and Hunt. Thomas' example here is
Reed's poem, whose yoking of Afrocentric ritual, myth and history to
entertainment commodities and "white" cultural icons  seems to have won the
ire of certain Black Arts critics. (Of course, we're all by now familiar in
broad outline with the historical narrative of the Black "cowboy," but
that's probably beside the point here). This could be a difference of
literary generation more than anything else, with Thomas and his Umbra
colleagues experiencing their work as something of a direct, critical
engagement with the "stylistic prescriptions" of a Black Arts orthodoxy,
while younger writers, less intimately involved in that particular
contention, might have been able to return to Black Arts practice for
indications of a broader, polyvocal approach. At any event, we've run so
late that there isn't really time for the divergence to be teased out in the
Q&A session -- which is, again, lively and well-informed, if a bit short --
so that discussion will have to wait until another day.

Tomorrow: Saturday night's reading and Sunday morning's panel. These will be
considerably shorter, since both took place in the absence of the bag in
which I carry my notebook. Working entirely from memory, I'll probably have
a good deal less to say.

Best,
Taylor

Republics of Reality: 1975-1995 contains seven out-of-print books and one new
sequence:

Parsing (1976)
Shade (1978)
Poetic Justice (1979)
The Occurrence of Tune (1981)
Stigma (1981)
Resistance (1983)
The Absent Father in "Dumbo" (1990)
& the new set: Residual Rubbernecking (1995)

Since SHADE was Sun & Moon Press's first book (side-stapled, with a "brushed"
photograph by Susan Bee on the cover), this publication provides the perfect
opportunity to thank Douglas Messerli for all his work on behalf of so many
poets and writers (including myself!).

In fairness to Perelman, Pat, it looks that way to him within
his frame of reference; unfortunately, he valorizes his own
point of view with "is," which makes it sound as if he had,
once and for all, denominated the official Scenic Outlook,
complete with gimballed binoculars at 25¢ for 5 minutes
of gape. As long as one insists on whacking together
a scaffolding for one's Sistine masterpiece with the mallet
of the copula ["be" & its litter], the frame will wobble,
& with it the stroke. Yet no one records the name of
Michaelangelo's scaffold maker, eh?

As for poetics, I prefer it first-hand, as in Spicer's
_A Textbook of Poetry_ or _Language_, or practically
anything in Duncan, and most especially in Jack Clarke's
_From Feathers to Iron_ & elsewhere than in the socio-
logical minuets that do-si-do & second-guess [not the
intent but] the motivation of the poem from its swerve
within some down-the-cosmos gravitational field like
the poet's presumed appetite for egalitarianism outside
the poem.

"The hell it is," you say--using the same verb, by the way
[fire w/ fire?]. I happen to agree on this particular, but
still find Perelman 'interesting' in places--about all one
can hope for, I suppose--perhaps 'informative' serves
better than 'interesting'... (though he, and perhaps anyone
who opts for the discursive mode to stipulate the aperiodic,
seems to spend more time swinging the blade than grinding it
--& I'd rather see a samurai sword made & sharpened,
*that* end of the art of it, than tested by slicing through the
torsos of captives--especially of captive poets).

That title--The Marginalization of Poetry--seems to refer
as much to the activity it enacts as to the activity it describes,
as if the instances cited function as witnesses necessary to
prosecute an indictment, but little more within the context of
such criticism (which, after all, criticizes society rather than
poetry, but turns poetry into social criticism as if to counter
the forces of opacity ranged against it--water w/ water?).

Not to knock Bob Perelman, who seems (I've never met him)
an engaged intelligence of sincere intent, but I've chosen not
to barrel-ass a semi in the bike lane (where most of the poets
dear to me ride most of the time). Wanna Casey Jones Pound or
Ginsberg or Olson--or Baraka, for that matter? Throw on
the high beams & damn the air brakes! Dr. Williams seems
to have taken a different route--no busses, no trucks.

Anyhow, thanks for the challenge. I hope it inspires
a string of poetic responses.

Dan

Subject:      Reading Report: Wieners Takes Harvard, Reduces it to Ashes
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

Thursday, April 13 in the Year of 2K

Poet: John Wieners. Lucid, talkative (for John Wieners). He read for about a
half-hour. Best-remembered poem opened with the line: "It's taken me fifty
years to learn I cannot write poetry." From anyone else it would have been a
platitude (says Mike County later).

Today is the second of three Wieners appearances in Boston. First was Saturday
night at a party held in his honor at Bill and Beverly Corbett's house in the
South End. Two six foot long sandwiches also attended. John sat beside his
cousin, her husband, and his nephew while poets read from the book of
homage-poems collected for him (The Blind See Only This World: Poems for John
Wieners. Granary Books/Pressed Wafer, 2000.) It was an event he endured
heroically and even stayed for long after it began to dissolve.

[On the sidewalk where the smokers had gathered John stood apart from the
crowd. Suddenly a heavy rain began and the smokers filed back inside. John
waited in line to reenter the house. As he passed me at the threshold he said,
" in we go."] Tuesday, 4/18, John will be in Brookline to read again and be
read to again.

John stood at a lectern in the Farnsworth Room of the Lamont Poetry Library at
Harvard University. Long, gray-black hair slicked back. Unshaven. A white
Oxford with thin blues stripes on, sleeves rolled to the elbows. Some kind of
fancy crest over the breast pocket. Fifty people in the room, among them:
Stratis Haviaras (organizer of the event, and soon-to-be retired
curator/director of the Poetry Room), Bill Corbett (introduced Wieners, but I
missed it), Jim Dunn (poet and part-time helper of John Wieners), Charles
Shively (longtime associate of Wieners; once burned his birth certificate or
draft card or passport or something, at a gay-rights rally), Joe Torra, Joel
Sloman, Damon Krukowski and Naomi Yang, Carol Weston (talked afterward of how
she read poetry once with Wieners and Gerrit Lansing at Boston City Hall in
1964. 1964? Yes, 1964. 1964?!?!? yes....), Jacques Debrot, Helen Vendler,
Spenser-scholar Sven Voekel, Sacco-Vanzetti scholar Robert D'Attilio, Chris
Sawyer-Laucanno, Patricia Pruitt, Ed Barrett, Patrick Doud, and the list goes
on.

Thru the window behind Wieners the newly restored tower of Memorial Hall
glimmered dully against the disappearing sun. Its new tiles and copper can
glimmer, but only dully. Memorial Hall is memorial to the Harvard dead of the
Civil War. Look for it in Henry James's 'The Bostonians." In a pause by
Wieners
I marvel at my own eyesight. The arches in the tower were very distant but
quite clear. I could see a hat on the stone ledge if a hat were there. I could
see the shadowy space within and the sky beyond. The sky was brilliant and
blue, the kind you lose balloons in.

Wieners refers to 1971 in the present tense.

I got to the reading just a few minutes late. Went to court today instead of
work. Waited 6 hours to testify ten minutes; never got the chance. A series of
interruptions (bail setting, restraining orders), recesses, and then the
window
of justice promptly slammed shut at four o'clock. Another tenant vs. landlord
case; our organizing helped to bring it here. I am present today to discredit
the landlord. He's made the job so easy, being a character out of Brecht's
"Resistible Rise of Arturo Ui". I laugh, writing this down:

Lawyer: "Is it true Mr. Cuddy notified you that there were mice in his
apartment?"

Landlord: "Yeah. I told him someone probably left the door open."

Judge (with sarcasm): "That's an interesting response."

Landlord (unperturbed): "Yeah, I told him to buy some traps and shut the
door."



Across the street from the courthouse a church is being demolished. Not
demolished exactly. Its shell will remain. (It shell remain.) The helmeted guy
standing in the dumpster says so. The church interior will be gutted like a
fish. For condos? The shell is derivative of the Old West Church in Boston,
where I heard Wieners read two years ago where he consistently missed the
microphone but we clapped wildly at the end anyway.

After the reading and the eating of cheese and some white wine we retire to
Charlie's Pub. On the way we see that Briggs and Briggs music store (where
they
sold sheet music and instrument parts, etc. for about a thousand years) has
been replaced by a showy plastic shoe store: Adidas. (As kids we called it:
All
Day I Dream About Sex.) Now we curse it and its stockholders. No store like
this is in Harvard Square to sell things. Only there to function as walk-in
catalogues, lose 20 grand a month in rent but the "visibility" is worth it.
Boston/Cambridge will be turned completely into a decorative center of
corporations and colleges within five years.

This is pessimistic but soon we turn sinister: what were the 60s? what were
the
90s? Seattle. Bioengineering. Attempts to wedge the debates a bit wider invite
the mainstream to call you nuts. But dissent has never been abberant. When the
mainstream allows recognition of what for years it strove to ignore, they will
call it "underground." Then it can be marketed. Chris and Ed are MIT
professors, training tomorrow's class of techno-priests. Will their students
ever read Wieners? The Spenser scholar wanted a list of Wieners poems he could
bring to his freshmen writing class at BU. Buy the Black Sparrows then call
me.
There is a spirit in poetry that can be felt, therefore followed. (Like the
spirit of law? Shades of Baron de Montesquieu.) Wieners distributes that
spirit. Saturday, prefacing his poem, Joe Torra called him "divine." It was
not
rhetorical.

Subject:      Wanted: critical work
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII

Poetics folks: I think many of you will be interested in this new journal.
Right now we are seeking critical work in particular concerning the
subject of "Poetry and Community."  Submissions that cross the boundary
between "criticism" and "poetry" are also encouraged.

--Molly Schwartzburg, Mantis Editorial Board

Mantis is a new journal of poetry, poetry translation, and poetry
criticism. A forum for writers coming from a broad spectrum of
intellectual and aesthetic positions, Mantis is dedicated to publishing
new work that interrogates the relationships among critical writing,
creative writing and translation.

Mantis is a graduate-student run journal edited by a collective of
graduate student poets, translators, and scholars at Stanford University.
It will appear in numbered issues starting in the fall of 2000. Each issue

Aldon (and all) --

Yes, we made cassettes directly from the PA (panels only -- the readings
unfortunately had to be single-miked. Kush videotaped those, but his prices
for dubs recently went up).

Anyhow, I think we got all of the panels and most of the Q&A sessions. Well,
the A anyhow, since Q happens off-mike. The sound is good, especially
considering the slapdash nature of our recording rig: one double-RCA line
and the tape deck from my home stereo.

I can't say with any certainty how access will work to the tapes --
permissions, etc., and various institutional factors might intervene. But I
will get in touch with Jocelyn in the next few days, and will also bring it
up at the next board meeting.

Best,
Taylor Brady

To jump from a Perelman interpretation of WCW that we happen to disagree
with to a supposiiton that poetics is impoverished seems as big a leap as
this original interpretive overstep. Whatever poetics is there seems to be
a lot of it. Poets are not exactly mute about what they are trying to
accomplish! Especially when we include the poems themselves along with the
essays. I don't see discourse of and about poetry to be impoverished at
all in relation, say, to language about music, art, etc... though its
sheer excess makes it harder to sort out.

Sans notes from which to work -- except a few written up at home several
hours after the events -- these will be a bit briefer than the previous
installments. My apologies to panelists, readers, organizers, etc. Too much
to keep track of over the weekend, and I think clearing the mental space in
which I'd have remembered the notebook allowed me to bring the tape deck,
which will prove more important, in the long run, than anything I might have
remembered to say.


_____________________________
IV: Saturday evening, group reading
_____________________________

Nathaniel Mackey begins the evening, reading new and previously-published
(in Whatsaid Serif) installments of Song of the Andoumboulou. First piece:
"Andoumboulouous Brush." "She blew into my clavicle" -- this line sticks
with me, echoing a similar clavicular flute in one or both of the Broken
Bottle novels. Eros, time, possession -- time, especially, as means and
medium for the other two, though Mackey rarely plays time. Here the sense of
his engagement with the musics that so inform his work is perhaps clearest,
though least given to explicit reference. (Which reference might be,
perhaps, another metronomic form of playing time?) The way pulse speaks of
bodily pulsions, also of other bodies, other times whose exclusions from the
pulse return to syncopate, stutter against, fragment rhythm: playing _with_
time as what the poet or musician does once playing time comes to seem too
much an act of denial and constriction. (Even the single body becomes
multiple: there's that great, probably apocryphal story of drummer Sunny
Murray, who during a solo drum clinic and discussion of polyrhythm invites
an audience member to the bandstand to take the pulse in his right and left
wrists and verify that the two are beating different times). Need I add that
Mackey reads these pieces beautifully, has obviously thought much about
questions of vocal timbre, pitch, etc.?

Mark McMorris follows, reading several poems. The one that stays with me
beyond the bus ride home is the long final suite, called, I think, "Where
the Pui Trees Flare." (McMorris explains that this names a vibrant,
yellow-blossoming tree found in Jamaica. I'm not sure about the spelling --
"pui-pui," I know, is a Virgin Islander word for a species of green parrot,
and the sound is similar enough that I've adopted that spelling here. Of
course, "Pui" also occurs fairly often in Chinese names, and a search on
Google turned up genealogy pages for several Chinese-American and
Chinese-Jamaican families. Might this be a source for the word? Just
curious). "The sweetie-man selling chewing gum and stockings": immediately
I'm nostalgic, not having heard anyone mention the sweetie-man since I left
Tampa, where it's much easier than in SF to hear a Jamaican lexicon as part
of everyday speech. McMorris' poem attempts to engage what he describes in
later discussion as the cultural project of a leftward turn in Jamaican
politics in the 70s, during which a fairly intensive series of
rehabilitations, celebrations, etc., of folk and popular forms was proposed
as the basis for the cultural work of nation-building. A deeply serious --
and beautiful -- address to the comforting familiarities, wounding edges,
utopian promise and missed opportunities of such a project to locate an
"utterance at climate level," its conflation of "organic" return and
forward-looking synthesis making of it a moment "past and still passing."

Harryette Mullen then takes the lectern to read from her current manuscript.
The puns in literary/vernacular/synthetic polylogics are still there, but in
place of the extended blues choruses of Muse & Drudge, these propose a form
both shorter (in the literal sense) and more expansive (in that there's a
discursive quality in them). Didn't get to see them on the page, but they
sounded like prose poems. Some are almost like short essays, though packed
with a much denser and more kinetic variety of language-action than one
usually attaches to that term. The discursivity allows a kind of topical
pointedness to take place here, while that sense of activity keeps things
from getting too settled. One poem toward the end brings this method to bear
on the post-LA-uprising, post-Desert Storm disorders of spectatorship, the
co-opted techniques of aesthetic estrangement that allow us collectively to
utter phrases like "low-intensity conflict" or "local unrest" without
choking. The argumentative, prose-essay approach allows for a continuity of
focus here, while the clash of multiple idiolects allows for a sustained and
various insistence that the reality is other than what that lens brings into
view. Powerful work, and Mullen's reading works well to sustain it,
mustering an almost conversational, relaxed assurance in the midst of that
density -- suggesting again a term she's brought up several times during the
conference, hybridity, which is here the double realization that theory and
critique are a kind of dialect, and that what's more usually called dialect
has been all along making a theoretical, critical claim on the attention.

Julie Patton's reading will probably defy my abilities at description, but
here goes: Most memorable is a long piece, in the language of botany, filled
with innuendo sexual and otherwise. (During the next day's panel, Patton
speaks of her delight in working with "all that dirty Latin"). She
foregrounds vocal performance as strongly as Coleman did on Friday night --
though answering to a completely different set of imperatives. Voice slides
back and forth between speech, chant, sprechstimme, scat, post-bop jazz
song, even a playground rhyme sort of cadence from time to time. Which makes
a forceful case and summing-up for one angle on what's been a value for the
conference as a whole, namely, the compossibility of, on the one hand,
tradition(s), research and understanding into the histories and identities
that feed into the performance, and on the other hand, the liminal status of
the performance itself -- that it does, in fact, perform, not recite. Very
valuable for me to hear it in this space, which is not by force of habit
given to such an emphasis on the in-time nature of poetic performance. Oh
yes, there's also, at the beginning, a lovely crackly tape of Russell Atkins
at home, wordless vocal improv with such a lush gruffness that the buzz of
harmonics around the edge approximates at times the sound of certain throat-
or nose-singng traditions. Which gets me thinking again about Mackey's
writing on the "rasp," "the creaking of the word," etc...

...but not for long, as Lorenzo Thomas comes on to finish the evening. Poems
deceptively easy-going that manage, by that approach, to get all the way up
to your ear and then whisper to you, both disquietingly and sustainingly,
all the way home. Home being, of course, one of the preoccupations here -- I
like, especially, the poem on visiting a Florida orange grove on the verge
of getting plowed under, marked out in the survey flags that signal the
coming of condos. (A condition I remark every time I go home). Speaking of
his hosts' former involvement, rootedness, in that landscape, "For their
children, I guess license plates will have to do." Which works, at first,
with the comfortable sadness of the wry humor it comes off as. But later,
still whispering to me, it tells a different, uglier story, asks a different
question: what happens to all that displaced agricultural labor, that one
understood as such large portion of what "work" meant in Florida? Making
license plates is labor of a different sort, and was, last I was home to
visit and checked on such things, still a prison industry. Power makes
provision for displacement by way of confinement. This sense of utterance
and art being haunted by a second, or third, etc., unanticipated voice runs
throughout the reading: "These faces do not depict people, but _are_ the
spirits that were visiting the tree when [anyone write down the artist's
name?] came to carve it." (That's a _very_ rough paraphrase, by the way). My
emphasis here misses by a mile, also, the roll-on-the-floor funny quality of
so much of what Thomas read -- citations to this effect from other
commentators would be much appreciated, as I think it's the weaving of the
one affective register into the other that made for the lasting impact his
reading had on me.




_____________________________
V: Sunday morning, panel, "Tell My Horse": Poetics of Practice
_____________________________

Tired, tired, so very tired....a few brief notes on this panel which,
between my fatigue, trouble with the tape deck, and the still-missing
notebook, ends up being my least notated. Other thoughts here, perhaps?
Anyhow, apologies to moderator giovanni singleton and the panel participants
for doubtless missing much of value. My subjective impression is that this
one has a different feel, maybe the result of everyone having spent the
weekend together. Congenial, relaxed, lots of reminiscence -- still, of
course, to great argumentative effect in terms of the issues raised
throughout the conference, but more in the mode one might address those
concerns in talk with a familiar interlocutor.

Some highlights, for me: Will Alexander talking about the push or pull
toward the vertical that first hearing Coltrane was. (Can't remember whether
he mentioned Om or Ole in this connection -- those long O's and me with no
notebook. My inclination would be to hear Om that way, but you could
probably make a case for it in Ole as well, what with the two basses
producing all those surprising eddies of time that generate potential for
motion in unexpected directions, i.e., letting the line of the soprano go
suddenly vertical).

Julie Patton on the "site-specific" in her work, both formally and as a
decription of its groundedness in city and place. The planes and pallettes
of backyards, lake, museum in Cleveland. The way those perceptual values
give onto political ones, her mother an art teacher at [name?], classes in
the carriage house behind her home, that integrated classroom becoming a
potential liability, occasion for thought on one sort of the
"precariousness" named in McMorris' paper, during mid- and late-60s rioting.
All of which could be taken to argue for the autonomy of artistic practice,
its sitedness nowhere but in its own made place. Or, read again, for the
inevitability of that art speaking from and to histories of violence,
struggle, provisional futures, etc., the way the Cleveland landscape ends up
figuring as analogy for later art practice, and the consequent need to take
the _whole_ of that landscape into the analogy.

Cecil Giscombe on the opening, for him, that was Baldwin's work, recommended
by a priest in the Catholic school he attended. A different sort of church
tradition anchoring a significant strand of African American literary
history -- Giscombe (paraphrased): "Of course, we weren't Catholics. But my
parents did what the Black middle class there (St. Louis) had long done, and
sent their kids downtown to learn with the Catholics." Emphasis on the value
of Baldwin's "articulation, in every sense of that word." And a similar
stress laid of Toomer's Cane, its proposal of the migration from Deep South
to Upper Midwest as the site -- site in transition, "past and still
passing" -- of his own work toward an African American poetics.


--------------------------------------------------------------------

Alright, I think I'll wrap things up there, with a final comment to second
what Tisa Bryant wrote the other day about the generosity of people at the
conference. And that includes so many -- panelists and readers, organizers,
volunteers, audience members. Simply for the chance to hear such engaged,
knowledgeable, and open approaches to the usually deadly axe-grinding of the
Q&A session... well, thanks to everyone involved. And for the continuation
of those questions and that talk in restaurants, bars, buses, street
corners, on and on.

Patrick--I haven't read Perelman's book yet, so I don't have the context
for this passage, and without having read the argument I'm not sure what
I would make of the comment about "claiming social status for the poet."
 BUT it really doesn't strike me as that big of a stretch to say that
Williams is talking, at least partly, about his own poetic line here.
He does this sort of thing, either implicitly or explicitly, zillions of
times, in poem after poem.  He was really pretty obsessed with the
subject & this is evident in the the poems, the essays, *and* the
letters.

It would be easy to make the case with an explicit example, but it's
more fun with an implicit one, so let's take the end of the poem from
Spring and All that later got titled the "The Right of Way":

Why bother where I went?
for I went spinning on the

four wheels of my car
along the wet road until

I saw a girl with one leg
over the rail of the balcony


Those last two lines are "about" enjambment.  They give us a witty image
of the practice even as they also enact it.  This sort of
meta-commentary runs all through Williams and makes for some damn good
"poetics" in its own right.

---A collaborative
---Art Show
---Of Checked Coats

---Featuring Work
---By 40 Artists

---At

---Museum Of Modern Art (M.O.M.A.)
---11 West 53rd Street

---Good Friday,
---21 April 2000, 6-8 pm

On Good Friday, April 21, 2000, 6-8 pm, 40 artists will check their artwork
inside their coats, into the MOMA coat room.

The playful intent of the project is to locate an artistic happening
somewhere in the vast physical and abstracted chasm between the artist's
imaginations and the brick and mortar institutions that ratify and reify
their creative ambitions.

The show will simultaneously occupy the most public and the most private of
spaces. The event occurs inside the walls of one of the most visible of all
art cathedrals, but it exists most tangibly inside the heads, or rather the
coats of the participating artists, unseen by 99% of MOMA's visitors.

The "audience" for the show will consist almost exclusively of the artists
themselves and their immediate circle of friends.

Checked's further intent is to "sanctify" the "exhibited" work in much the
same way religious institutions sanctify relics by palcing them in the
shrouded cavities of their most holy sites. The relocation of the art
objects in Checked to this holy site will contribute to their
beautification, for they will become seasoned with meaning, metaphor and
historic significance.

While the major theme is that of transubstantiation, sub themes include
longing, loss, accessibility, inclusiveness. Checked can't help but be a
comfy viewing experience since the whole show exists only in the minds of
it's willing collaborators. Check it out.

Tom Raworth's selected writing, TOTTERING STATE, has just been reprinted by
O Books (ISBN 1-882022-38-6, 240 pages, $15.00). Available from SPD. It
features new work, including the entire fast-moving mind-wrecking WRITING.
   Lyn Hejinian said about this collection:
   "The writings in this TOTTERING STATE are ardent, wry, wise, brilliant --
they are subtle and momentous. They are responsive to the minute as to the
massive pressures that language and life exert. They are explorations, not
outcomes. And yet they make demands, and consequences continually occur.
Some of these consequences are funny (Tom Raworth has a tragedian's sense of
the comic as one of life's fated inevitabilities), some are frightening or
sad. These are among the greatest writings of out times."
   Anselm Berrigan says:
   "Tom Raworth wants to get all the way round the railroad earth before the
bell rings, one of the few who even try, &we get these tottering states,
equal parts light and dark of mind, lavished on us when he does, &he often
does."
   Miles Champion says:
   "Stretched tight across Life while allowing both mind &eye to breathe,
this writing orients reading on the set where the action is. The backcloth
is limitless/polychromatic (& no, the walls of the ego are NOT the walls of
the set). As Shorty Fleming noticed while out picking plums: 'Tom Raworth's
(    )ed through THAT fence.' "

Dan,

Thank you for your beautiful evocation of JW's reading.

When I try, though, to put my finger on W's affect--for me--it's a somewhat
different feeling than what you suggest.  What can one say about W's most
recent work?  He's not Artaud lecturing at the Theatre du Vieux. . . .  You
can't say that he's on to anything really of any value now, or interest.
Rather, my feeling, watching JW read, is that it's like listening to someone
**who has died**--being in the presence of someone who is dead--so, yes, 1971
**is** in the present tense.  &, although I am an atheist, I did feel as
though I was in the company of ghosts . . . of O'Hara's ghost, and Spicer's .
. .

Peter Schjeldahl sees "funny inflations" in art today as "very 2000,"
and I wonder how this does not pertain to today's societies and texts of poetry.

Schjeldahl argues unapocalypticallly, "Art today waits upon the
idiosyncratic decisions of artists as at no other moment," taking work
at the Whitney Biennial and P.S. 1 "Greater New York" as his most recent
palimpsest. He writes, "creative sap is running backward from art's
public branches to its personal and small-constituency roots"; more,
there's "a flexibility among current artists that replaces the
avant-gardish truculences of yesteryear...The locus of artistic freedom
now is art itself, which is apparent in all the blooming sophistication
about the uses of mediums and genres. Our new artists industriously fit
tasks to tools."

"Ambitious ideas are out. Humble principles are in, notably a
professional dedication to pleasing viewers."

Schjeldahl is impressed but sees a grandiose mediocrity -- "because
something crucial to ultimate excellence is missing... Our aversion to
extremes prohibits the extraordinary." We demand "peak performances"
from sports, entertainment, design, etc., yet in matters of art "we skim
along" and leave "untouched" aspirations and sufferings.

To wait or ask for more? We can't have everything, Schjeldahl says.

Come See Hear!  In New Langton's continuing occasional exploration of
visual poetries,

JACQUES DEBROT and AVERY BURNS read, show slides, and carry on:


Saturday, April 22, 8 pm

New Langton Arts

1246 Folsom Street @ 9th

San Francisco, CA 94103

415.626.5416 ph

www.newlangtonarts.org

Tickets: $6 general, $4 students, seniors, Langton members.


AVERY BURNS will present a reading/slide show of his new chapbook
<fontfamily><param>Geneva</param>_A Duelling Primer_</fontfamily>:

<fontfamily><param>Geneva</param>The poems in <italic>A Duelling
Primer</italic>, refered to as figures, contain two parts.

The first combines illustrations from an 18th Century

fencing manual with a form of free associative

eckphrasis.  The second part reverses the order

with a brief lyric followed by a visual element.

Pascal's four-square turned from belief to

communication.  Many primers start with an ABCs and this work

is no exception: Action; Buy a vowel; Careen across the floor; Defend;

Ekphrasis; ET CETERA!


</fontfamily>JACQUES DEBROT will provoke us:

Is poetry for nothing or for all or nothing?  In a multimedia
presentation from his new chapbook _Confuzion Comix_ and other works,
Jacques Debrot will confuse this issue entirely.  Think of Pop art,
Emily Dickinson,

television infomercials, and _The Joy of Sex_ and you will have some
idea of

the effect Debrot is aiming for in his
nose-pressed-against-the-department

store-window-poetry.  Or, to put it another way, if it doesn't look
like a

duck, or walk like a duck, or sound like a duck, can it really be a
duck?


<fontfamily><param>Geneva</param>Copies of _A Duelling Primer_ and
</fontfamily>_Confuzion Comix_<fontfamily><param>Geneva</param> (both
from Second Story Books) will be available at the reading.

Hi Gary,
I've pasted a review below of Dan Featherston's "26 Islands" for you to use
if you want. I did post it to the list back in May if that makes a
difference to you. I also have a visual essay of Joan Retallack's "NOH S'EX"
on my web site at www.99main.com/~swmarks/essays.htm for you to publish if
you'd like. You could just download the JPGs right from the site or, I
guess, use the URL and open up the essay in another window.Whatever.

Hope you find either or both of use now or for future issues. Thanks.

best,
Steven

| Hi L!  Thanks for your confusion.  Maybe you've given me a chance to
| clarify.  The "thing" is visual poetry.  That seemed a pretty clear
| reference to me.  No confusion from Bob--at least not yet.  As  I
| said, not every visual poem fits the category.

Ah! I knew you were talking about vispo and my "What things?" was a kind of
rhetorical opposition to your claim. As you say, not every vispo fits the
category; but you didn't say that then. I was probably doing you a

that you were speaking of *some vispo as if it were *all vispo.

As to greatness, I'm still fighting that one. No surrender, say I.

Monday night the 13th at Larry's, Gina Tabasso read her work to an
energetic group of 68 folks mostly from OSU on this particular evening.
She started with pieces from the _Between my Legs_ collection published
by New Spirit Press. Then continued into a second, unpublished
manuscript, then into a third manuscript called The Centaur Poems, which
contained recent pieces in the Mid-American Review, Black Dirt, Slant
and others.

A ten minute break was needed. About the poems, the centaur poems are a
serial work re-invigorating the age old theme between horses and women
and the love expressed between. There is no simple way to breach this
widely ignored tradition, without the poems sounding trite on this
medium, but there are resonances similar to Joy Harjo and the notion of
the reverse centaur, man on bottom, worked incredibly well. The audience
enjoyed the reading tremendously even Victor, who is unable to speak,
belted his only sound out a few times, WHOO-ahhhhhh, and somebody wet
somebody elses pants spilling a pitcher in surprise. The second 25
minute set was real fine, wish I had something here to give an example--

Highlights of the open, some real fine poems & translations by Robert
Waugh, Rose M. Smith ploughed the audience with her piece about
inheriting a boiling pot used for raccoon, Steve Abbott read a long poem
with some motile imagisme, the raffle book this week, June Jordan's
newest book was inflicted upon our lucky winner and Rita Moog read a
fine piece about candles. The jukebox came on shortly after playing I
just wanna be your dog.

The after reading party was at my house again, this time Stevie Mainard,
Lara Mellott, Rita Moog, Julie Otten, Steve Abbott, and others with most
of the conversation focused on thoroughbreds, care and maintanence, Dave
Snodgrass' slam events & where the hell he was, a recent trip to Rome
and Egypt, relationship problems,  Jason and the Argonauts, the usual
poetic concerns. Left the place to Gina for the night, crashed
elsewhere, woke early, showed her our fine city, the biggest in Ohio, up
to 15th population-wise this year, ate some food at the dirty blue
danube, got some sleep & readied for company from NY Wed, Oregon thurs--

Be well

SALLY SILVERS & DANCERS:
Storming Heaven
April 26-29 [Wed-Sat] 8pm $15

"Choreographer tears through a century of revolutions spanning from the Paris
Commune to the Zapatista Rebellion."

Choreographer: Sally Silvers

Performers: Karl Anderson, Kate Gyllenhaal, Phillip Karg, Andrea Kleine,
Paige Martin, Alejandra Martorell, David Neumann, Mark Robison, Sally
Silvers, and Cydney Wilkes.

Lighting Design: David Fritz
Costumes: Elizabeth Hope Clancy.

Madcap choreographer Sally Silvers returns to The Kitchen with the premiere
of Storming Heaven-an evening-length work that tears through a century of
revolutions spanning from the Paris Commune to the Zapatista Rebellion. With
live action visuals by the legendary Antonio Martorell, a soundscape by
artist/writer Bruce Andrews, and an all-star cast of 10, Storming Heaven
re-envisions social changes, zigzaging through the body map of revolution
with haunting optimism.  Inspired by the provocative 1975 opera by
experimental Venetian composer Luigi Nono (In the Sun's Love Provoking Light),
 the piece spotlights a quartet of women travelling through social upheavals
in Russia, China, Vietnam, Cuba, Paris, and Mexico. It combines
hyper-activating fractured movements with passion and humor, giving a female
perspective on a shattered (and shattering) order-revolution and lace.

About the Artist:
Artistic director Sally Silvers has an on-going fascination with the poetic
as well as the social meanings of movement and offers a no-holds-barred
exploration of movement possibilities slanted toward the eccentric, awkward,
and unexpected.  She has received support from the National Endowment for the
Arts, New York Foundation for the Arts, the Jerome Foundation, two Meet the
Composer/Choreographer Project grants for collaborations with John Zorn and
Bruce Andrews, and a 1998 Guggenheim Fellowship.  Last season, she performed
in The Joyce Theater's Altogether Different Festival.  She also recently
co-directed 2 dance films, choreographed 3 musicals for the Sundance Theatre
Festival, and performed at The Whitney Museum of Art's program "Impulsive
Behavior".

The Kitchen is located at 512 west 19th Street (between 9th & 10th Avenues).
For tickets call the box office at 212-255-5793 ext. 11 (Hours: Tues-Sat,
2-6pm).

Subject:      Re: visual poetry--Bob Grumman!
Comments: To: Lawrence Upton <lawrence.upton@BRITISHLIBRARY.NET>

Hi L!  Thanks for your confusion.  Maybe you've given me a chance to
clarify.  The "thing" is visual poetry.  That seemed a pretty clear
reference to me.  No confusion from Bob--at least not yet.  As  I
said, not every visual poem fits the category.  But I still think
many do.  The commingling of painting and poetry simply refers to
those canvases that offer words and images, e.g., the wonderful
works by Larry Rivers cum Frank O'Hara.  The fact that on the page
the visual image is drawn or computer constructed doesn't change
the basic methodology of combination.  As for those artists who
have worked in New York City for many, many years on digital language
productions, e.g., Kruger--their works routinely appear in
galleries and not as collections of poems.  These works resemble
quite closely visual poetic experiments with structure/size/
shape of letters/words.  I was just wondering if
those with clout, i.e., those who award prizes, etc., comprehend
vp as as something better served by the gallery.  Doesn't mean I
agree or disagree with them.  If they do--if they believe visual
poetry is an old "thing" under a different roof--then that might
explain their resistence.  See?  As for "greatness," I think it has
been fairly well accepted for decades that the designation refers
to a confluence of forces aesthetic, social, historical--a work
of art's being in the right place at the right time, expressing
a zeitgiest (perhaps accidently) and surviving all efforts to
flush it.  Certain terms/concepts and their references have been
well set (though, of course, provisional, as are all linguistic
centers), so perhaps getting bogged down in explanations for every
little "thing" doesn't help further the argument.  However,
I must admit that interrogating everything. every word, every
nuance, is really interesting for me.  So again, thanks.
A Brit, huh?  I've been to London several times, performed there,
and loved it.  Those guys (the Londoners) appreciated my nasty
NYC stuff (poetry).  One of the best audiences I've ever had.

Dan Raphael read last and Julie Otten & John M. Bennett played rock,
scissors, paper or some more inflated decisive order making game and
therefore--

Julie Otten read first, reading three long poems, The Death of Andy
Gibb, a graphic piece about his stomach exploding, roller skating rings,
and learning to give blow jobs to "I Just Want to Be Your Everything."
Gabriels Hearse, was next, a piece about a father buying his kid a
hearse because the kid has better looking girlfriends and is a real
gonowhere. Alyce's Hair, ended the set, "hair the color of a Barbie
dipped in baby shit" which "when you wash it, you have to touch it like
a cake you test for doneness." Many laughs were given through the
reading, the only disappointment being that her reading was cut short
due to the ex-slag burning, environment induced sinus infection that
hits many Ohioans this exact time of year.

John M. Bennett started with _Mailer leaves Ham_ from Pantograph. His
reading was a real treat, the way he snarls on crust, or any K sound.
These pieces sizzled reading-wise, much giggling was heard and eyes were
widened by the end of these. Bennett is an excellent reader, a
contortionist with his mouth as he hits all of the phonemes and
morphemes notefully from the page score.  There was discussion of
Bennett's brilliant reading style after and his use of crust as a sexual
image despite the sound. _Mailer_  did me in. The third set piece I feel
incapable of describing. Comparisons to Schwitters were made, but none
to Chuck Stein. As for the fourth, metrically it was broken into lines
of eight syllables, but it did not seem to have the impact of the first
two "sets" he read from. It's focus was not nearly as consonant based,
perhaps this was why. The second set was a reading from the
collaboration with Ivan Arguelles (Chac Prostibulario) which includes as
many as 12 languages, this was the most technically achieved
experimental piece I've heard aloud and attempted to understand at the
same instant, here's a stanza:

the lig ht fog cut c ut ter minal be
gins to list er ate yr nal gas ga zing
mas alla del ruedo row dar t I'm e rio
"real b lame" the frowning moth
madrastra c limbs/tiny flutes//rice chews
outside the corn you grave ("mice m ice")
nada r en tu zapato (calce tin tin

Then we took a break, well needed, the melted ears & minds of the
audience headed frontward to see the library of books on display.

Dan Raphael blew out any expectations reading a greatest hits selection.
Healthy page counts were read from _trees through the road_ , _Molecular
Jam_, _isn't how we got here_, and _The Bones Begin to Sing_ as well as
some newer work. Raphael is a large guy and swirls his energy around in
movements bringing the air in cyclones of words without loss of
referent. Pilation, image upon image, in circuitortous movement in how
one image impounds another in litigations of unlawful yokings. If you
could be any tree what would you be? Raphael knows what textures to
forgive and which to incorporate, not to mention the swaying and dance
like movements in the words and in the physical of the black sock footed
giant. The Cherry Tree at the Top of the Stairs wiped the audience
clean.  Here is another--


"And Now, a Word from your Atmosphere"

Said the conductor up the hoop of funk over whose ground
                                                thru whose air of
carnality--
    "you call this meat RARE?"
                                     my third leg a hundred decibel bass

like manhole covers with great moves and knees flexing too fast to count

we pump, we hump, we leave the ground and come back tomorrow

Yo
means me
that shadow with a car in his chest, american steel, clutchless shifting

for efficiency, shiftlessly clutching to no one not in my mirror at
night-
background, rear view, coming up from the inside, knuckle curve spit,
centrifugal curling,
                     Like bach on methedrine playing sonic scattergun
each bird shot a chord stainvaying to some feathery oven
we rise in, yeast out of, party like an osprey
with how many brain-damaged sparrows inside:

Yeah they sing and fly even in their sleep--
they never sleep, the sun never goes down, beauty going down
where, stain of a fine time, wont ever wash this out, moon cyst,
digital paralysis with them numbers swimming like my fingers separate as
fish--

surging trout, salmon smelling heat,
            thumb sturgeon waiting to pounce & hold down:
Never let em up for air,  air so far away,  air not meant to recycle,
air on a mission,
                            Don't trust it-- air'd do anything for skin
of its own,
to play flute with no slobbering lips and spasming lungs to run sour--

All across town air escapes from tires, balls and various prisons,
liberating the vacuums of lightbulbs and thermoses, turning up the
pressure,
taking names and teaching the new rules--

Listen to this, sucker,
or next time you breathe
                                        nothings going down


Many thought it the best reading for some time. I was impressed at how
the audience was able to follow his great (i)magic leaps without puzzled
looks, trusting they were being lead somewhere important, so sat back,
relaxed, enjoyed the ride. We went out to Dow's on High, John had to get
up early for the library, took a raincheck. Discussions about
publishing, Oregon poets, Ohio poets, meth labs,  the environment,
mexican drugs, and so on. Read some poems aloud, got engrossed in a play
in the new NEOTROPE: All Story, which kept me up, light sleep, breakfast
at Jack & Benny's, Raphael read a poem he wrote me, then went off to
BGSU----

Dear Anselm,

Do you teach workshops to middle-high school inner city kids?  Would you like
to do a residency at the WWCAC next year?  I am hoping to have your mother
back for a reading in the upcoming season as well.

When Anne Waldman was here in the spring we talked about doing a Naropa in
Camden week w/faculty from Naropa and the Poetry Project--about having a
week-long residency w/workshops/classes/lectures/symposia/and readings.   I
am committed to the idea of poetry week with both of you in Camden and would
love to host and participate in it.  It probably won't occur until the 2001-2
season, and will require a lot of planning anyway, but let me know what you
think and we can talk more later about it.

I wish I could offer you a building, or an endowment, but perhaps this is a
start.  I look forward to hearing from you.

Best,

Alicia

Well, there's no accounting for taste.  If you're looking for a more
scientific approach, you'll just set yourself up for Derrida.  Whatever
floats the boat.  As for Ramsey's complaint--that little coupling
about the geography of "I" says nearly everything we need to hear
about the structure of language.  A terrific collision of metaphor
and metonymy.  I like it!

Subject:      eloquence: a ramble
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

Ron mentioned in the revision thread his lack of interest in texts that are
too polished, and I'd like to follow up on that. For me, it has to do with
eloquence. I am strongly attracted to work that shows a range from
inarticulateness to eloquence. It's one thing I find absolutely compelling
about Van Morrison (yet another musical source. sorry). Sometimes it seems
to take almost superhuman will just to get the words out, he is so tied up
in knots. He has frequently resorted to a sort of stuttering (most notably
there's the line about being tongue-tied on"Astral Weeks"). Anyway there's
that inarticulateness, which is really powerful, there is so much tension
so much energy wrapped so tight, and then there are these supreme moments
of release and beauty, almost unimaginable joy. And he gives you that whole
range.

I think that's one thing I get in jazz too. I love those points in a solo
when the musician seems to be digging around looking and looking and then
HERE IT IS! Yeah! You get that a lot with Coltrane obviously, and there's a
distinction we could make, between the hesitant tongue-tied inarticulate
and the prolix rambling inarticulate. Miles Davis packs incredible energy
into those hesitant careful spare phrases, and then there's Coltrane just
going on & on refusing to give up, I can find it I can find it I have to
find it and you can almost feel the need the frustration to --- as Creeley
always says Williams said (and he did) --- "get said what must be said".
(Although I also want to say I'm not sure playing is all that much like
talking.) Monk is another great example of an artist who gives you that
energy that's bound up with being inarticulate. Sometimes in Bud Powell's
later recordings there is a sort of prolix desperation, because he can't
find it, and he goes on, and it's like he knows he can't make the piano do
what he wants. It's pretty gutwrenching. Not like his earlier stuff wasn't
already tense enough, but he could get there in the early days.

Now it's not that I don't like eloquence, I think, I just find it hard to
trust. It's what has always made it hard for me to like Milton. I have a
sort of gut-level fear of sound overwhelming meaning. But that's not a
problem with eloquence per se, it's just the ancient fear of sophistry. And
I think it's what I find appealing about the language writers rejection of
voice, except that I don't really have a problem, again, with voice per se,
but with its potential duplicity. There are voices I love & trust. Even
eloquent voices. Even when I recognize that I'm being seduced. Two voices
I'm a sucker for: Wittgenstein & Lincoln. Voices I was a sucker for:
Nietzsche, Heidegger, Derrida, Yeats, lots of people I can't read at all
now, I mean not at all. All of these guys have a sort of eloquence, albeit
idiosyncratic.

Now it seems to me that the disjunctive paratactic style in poetry is at
least this: a resistance to eloquence. I think you can see that
particularly in Michael Palmer, because the individual sentences are often
noticably elegant, but put together to forestall an accumulation of
eloquence. A voice that can't seem to stick to one train of thought is not
often perceieved as eloquent, even if sentence by sentence it's quite
striking. I've always had this problem reading Emerson, that each sentence
is a new aphorism, and that makes for bad paragraph rhythm. (I don't feel
bad about selling E short because I've never been able to read enough to do
otherwise & don't take my view of him too seriously.) Now here's an odd
hook-up with a famous bit of American poetics. That great seductive Voice
called Robert Frost memorbaly talked about sentence sounds, and I always
found that pretty convincing stuff. only it turns out sentences are not
enough. You need more. You need paragraph sounds at least. (Milton.) And it
gets almost to saying there are language sounds, but I think not. I think
the crucial level is exactly what Wittgenstein said it was, namely the
level of language-games, and it is here that disjunctive, paratactic,
new-sentence style writing (if I've got this right at all) seems to take
hold. The sentences may be fine, but they are thrown together in a way that
seems to rip them out of whatever language-game you might ordinarily find
them in, and it's remarkable how much that takes out of them, and then of
course the reader can imaginatively restore them, and gets some say in how
that works, different possibilities, etc. Wittgenstein does this almost
constantly, it's his main tactic. (This is what Perelman I think calls
re-narrativization or something.) One thing that's particularly appealing
about this is that at least it pops the balloon of the fake language-game
so many poems play, the no one speaking nowhere to nobody about how
interesting whatever is. What's so damned annoying about that is not the
oddness of it, but the failure to notice the oddness or the determination
to pretend it's all perfectly ordinary. In what universe does anyone hear a
tenseless narrtive of how I dunno existential the frost on the grass was
this morning when Whoever's Talking went outside with his cup of sanka?
It's a pretend language-game, it's fantasy, in I think the same way
Wittgenstein thought mainstream philosophy was. Something like that. Which
is of course not to say language ought only to be used for ordering milk,
but only to say that writing a poem is not the same sort of thing as
ordering milk and you're a fool or a liar if you act like it is.

There's also the pretence to eloquence that's so prevalent in trade-house
poetry, and again it's just a matter of sound, of stirring associations of
real eloquence. Wallace Stevens is probably responsible for a lot of this,
because he had this odd way of recouping almost any inarticulateness any
limitation within a larger eloquence. Those noble inescapable rhythms. Well
that's one man's demon, but it needn't be everyone's. (James Wright once
said he took a step forward when he realized it was his own facility that
he had to overcome. That's alright.) And of course Frost has begat upon us
a lot of this sort of thing too, and again with the failure to recognize
the tension, the need to at least be eloquently inarticulate so that even
when you can't say what you want to (in lots of senses) people will think
well of you. That's a demon I'd be happy to live without.

I could probably go on --- oh yeah, meant to mention Beckett of course, and
now I have. I'm going to stop, but I'd love to know to know if anyone else
has any thoughts on eloquence & inarticulateness, further examples, why
I've got it all wrong, whatever.

Pat

other than Derrida, meaning: in flight


"If I were optimistic enough on the subject, I would say that I see the
journey of my brief existence as a journey in view of determining and
naming the place from which I will have had the experience of exteriori-
ty. And the anamnesis we were talking about at the outset, this anamnesis
would be in view of identifying, of naming it--not effacing the exterior-
ity, I don't think it can be effaced--but of naming it, identifying it,
and thinking it a little better than I have done so far." - Derrida, There
is No _One_ Narcissism, in Points, trans. Kamuf & others. And this in
relation to an exteriority beyond exteriority, in relation, or brought up
or into question or commentary, of the Judaic; one can see a differend at
work within an _interiority_ here, a form of internal exile, but from
what, if not a non-exile garnered only by an otherwise unidentified alt-
erity. And in this regard, we notice again the hypnotic and its relation
to non- or in-transitivity, alterity without an object, always, to the
extent a representation, a misrecognition or misrepresentation, but one
grounding, shifting the grounds, never called into question. I write of or
on (the body of) this, a place I identify, to the extent it remains
peripheral to identity, weak or fragile, almost invisible, certainly out
of or one with, the imaginary. It is the premise or promise of the world
at its horizon, as one pursues "one's" project - in spite of the fact
that, deeply random or chaotic, a project remains just that, in pursuit of
a goal, in pursuit of meaning as well. Meaning is always in flight; one
writes within the gap. And culture is always already liminal, interstiti-
al; death, of being and Beings, tending towards foundation, guarantee,
contract, strategy. Writing into the void is the semblance of determina-
tion, the substrate on the move.

CFP: Caribbean Harlem Renaissance Recontextualized (5/15; 9/29-30)

I'm proposing a panel for the Contextualizing the Caribbean: New
Approaches in an Era of Globalization Conference, University of Miami,
Coral Gables, FL, Sept. 29-30, 2000.  Deadline for submissions: May 15,
2000

Caribbean Harlem Renaissance Recontextualized intends to explore the
various ways in which West Indian writers, intellectuals, political
activists, participants in social movements, etc. helped shape the
Harlem Renaissance and how the Renaissance assisted in fashioning
Caribbean cultural arts, political action, and social identity.
Moreover, periodization of the Black Renaissance will enjoy considerable
latitude.  As William Maxwell argues, the Black Renaissance may be
resituated as beginning earlier than the Red Summer of 1919, and it may
continue after the Harlem Riot of 1935, encompassing the growth of
radical internationalism and anticolonialism.

Possible topics for papers may include the following, individually or in
any combination:
*Claude McKay
*Eric Walrond
*Joel A. Rogers
*Aime Cesaire and negritude
*George Padmore and radicalism
*W.A. Domingo and African Blood Brotherhood
*Marcus Garvey and UNIA
*Zora Neale Hurston in the Caribbean
*internationalist/Marxist/anti-imperialist politics
*New Negro as constructed through/against West Indian identity
formations
*representations of West Indians in Harlem Renaissance texts
*early modes of transnationalism vis-a-vis/vs. African American
exceptionalism
*transgressive and experimental sexual relations/Queer Renaissance
*West Indian women in Harlem Renaissance
*Black Renaissance as site for West Indian diaspora
*West Indians via Harlem-Paris (Black Montmartre) transatlantic
connection
*West Indian migration and ethnoscapes
*influence of jazz and blues on West Indian popular music
*influence of West Indian pop music on jazz and blues

POETRY CENTER 2000
The Poetry Center & American Poetry Archives
presents

An evening with JOHN A. WILLIAMS
introduced by Ishmael Reed
Thursday April 27, 7:30 pm, $5 donation
@ The Unitarian Center
1187 Franklin (at Geary)
San Francisco

JOHN A. WILLIAMS is a true master of the contemporary novel.  *  His
justifiably famous early books, including The Man Who Cried I
Am--recognized on publication as "the most powerful novel about blacks in
America since Ralph Ellison's Invisible Man"--are really only the tip of
the iceberg when it comes to Williams' accomplishment. *  A prolific writer
of great versatility, over 40 years he has published a dozen novels, along
with works of social history, journalism, essays, and biographies of
Richard Wright and (with his son Dennis Williams) Richard Pryor.  *  His
latest novel, Clifford's Blues, is an astounding work of compassionate
vision and imagination; his earlier classic Captain Blackman has just been
reissued this spring as the premier book in Coffee House Press's Black Arts
Movement Series; and his first novel, published variously as One For New
York (the author's title of choice) and as The Angry Ones, is part of
Norton's "Old School" Series.  *  Recently retired from his position as
Paul Robeson Professor at Rutgers, Mr. Williams lives in Teaneck, New
Jersey.

*  He'll be introduced by his friend and fellow novelist, ISHMAEL REED.  *

Hi all, I am teaching a multi-level (4 classes in one) poetry class
(workshop I do mean) again next semester. This semester I used Poetry
Writing: Theme and Variation, which is quite good, but I want a change -- I
am looking for suggestions of brief collections of poetics essays by a wide
range of poets (if such a thing exists!) to use in conjunction with current
issues of a couple of mags. Thanks, Elizabeth

For Immediate Release:

The 21st Orphic Feast:
Good Taste in Art (Art to be Eaten)
BY SUSTENANCE ARTISTS OKA AND FITCH WITH DANIEL BOULUD
PRODUCED BY THE ASIA SOCIETY AND ETHAN COHEN FINE ARTS
Good taste in Art (Art to be Eaten) is an installation of abstract
expressionist paintings and sculptures by Oka and Fitch, in an edible
translucent medium. The show has two parts: an event entitled "The 21st
Orphic Feast" on May 24th, 2000, and an ongoing exhibition of preserved works
in edible media. The feast will feature food prepared by Daniel Boulud and
his team.
Participants at the 21st Orphic Feast enter the gallery, view the
installation, parade a 250 foot noodle to the feast location, where they will
choose a work to purchase. All works can either be eaten or "archivally"
preserved. We are asking guests to choose how they want to be consumers of
art, by purchasing it as material object or by eating it. Guests who choose
to digest their art will bring it to one of several "art-to-food
transformation stations," (i.e. pots of boiling water_ where it is cooked,
seasoned and garnished by Daniel Boulud, thus transformed into cuisine.
Oka and Fitch, known for their events that synthesize art and food, have
created the Orphic fest as a means to explore art as experience. Orphic
Feasts have taken place
in Tokyo, Southwest France, under the Manhattan Bridge and at the Asia
Society in New York.
Proceeds from the 21st Orphic Feast will benefit the programs of the Asia
Society. The Asia Society is America's leading institution dedicated to
fostering understanding of Asia and communication between Americans and the
peoples of Asia and the Pacific. A non-profit, nonpartisan educational
institution, the Asia Society presents a wide range of programs including
major art exhibitions, performances, media and educational programs.
This is the second Orphic Feast to be commissioned by the Asia Society, and
represents their continuing commitment to a diverse expression of
contemporary art.
The feast will take place on May 24th at Ethan Cohen Fine Arts at 37 Walker
Street.
        7:00 Look at the Paintings
        8:00 Parade of the Noodle
        8:30 Eat the Paintings.
Unconsumed works of art will be on exhibit until sometime in June.

"But Dante's hell is heaven. Look at things in another light. Not always
the smarting blue glare pressing through the glass. Another light, or
darkness. Wherever we'd go to rest. By the simple rivers of our time.
Dark cold water slapping long wooden logs jammed 10 yards down in the
wierd slime, 6 or 12 of them hold up a pier. Water, wherever we'd rest.
And the first sun we see each other in. Long shadows down off the top
where we were. Down thru grey morning shrubs and low cries of waked up
animals."

enough; however, i shall at least take care of the larger pieces. there
are some furry mammals which are distinguished by a rather playful
attitude towards just about everything; i'm certain these shall survive,
no matter the quantity of hurled torrents or molten lavas. these mammals
shall skip merrily about, but will lose their delicious dinosaur eggs; on
the other hand, they'll learn quickly enough to gobble up embryos of
flaccid dino-corpses, while chattering incessantly to each other. my goal,
however, is to make this as difficult as possible, so that later human
beings will look up at the sky and say, oh what a world. they do not
realize that i am sentient, as driven as they are, not blind gravity, but
by a desire to annihilate. every stone has its mandate, every speck of
dust, its destiny. oh what nonsense i can write, "said nikuko, having
finished her studious peroration.

"The hand of even the most cautious operator was bound to be drawn into
the cutter space if it slipped, particularly when, as often happened, the
timber was hurled back (by the cutter block) while the operator was pres-
sing the article to be planed against the table with one hand and feeding
it to the cutter spindle with the other. This lifting and recoiling of the
timber could not be anticipated nor prevented as it may have been due to
gnarls or knots in the timber, to an insufficietly high cutting-speed, to
warped cutters, or to uneven pressure of the operator's hands on the arti-
cle." (Kafka, quoted in Max Brod, Franz Kafka, a Biography.)

I have just published "The Secret History of the Equal Sign: L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E
Between Discourse and Text" in the journal Poetics Today, and have offprints
available. I will send it to you if you will send me $2 to cover the cost of
the offprint. If interested, e-mail me at: <b.watten@wayne.edu>.

The essay discusses the politics and poetics of multiauthored, collaborative
experimental texts, and provides a short history of the name and social
formation of the Language School. It addresses, as well, the poetics of the
Listserve itself, seen as a form of multiauthorship. The abstract appears
below.

My review essay of Masocriticism, Paul Mann's recent contribution to "wild
theory," has also just appeared in the UK journal Textual Practice. Mann's
book discusses the destructive relations critics may have to their objects
of criticism, and vice versa, and ethical implications of the negativity of
the postmodern text. My review takes on the question of the necessity of
this negative relationship, and tries to reformulate it from an author's
perspective. If you would like to see a xerox of this essay, I'd be happy to
send it along.

ABSTRACT

Avant-gardes, in breaking down the boundaries of the autonomous author in
favor of both the work and its immediate reception within its community,
frequently employ strategies of "multiple authorship," in which the work is
positioned between two or more authors, toward a horizon of collective
practice or politics. Any theory of the avant-garde must take into account,
not only the poetics of its devices of defamiliarization and their relation
to the construction of new meaning, but its stakes in the discursive
community defined by means of its literary practices. This essay discusses
several examples of avant-garde multiauthorship developed by writers of the
Language School: the collective authorship represented by L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E
and other literary journals; Legend, a multiauthored experimental poem by
five authors; two poems written under the title "Non-Events" by the author
and Steve Benson; and Carla Harryman and Lyn Hejinian's collaborative novel
The Wide Road. Michel Foucault's concept of "discursive formation" and Julia
Kristeva's dialectic of "symbolic" and "semiotic" provide critical terms for
an approach to the politics of community enacted in works of the
avant-garde. These cultural politics, and their implications for the genres
of poetry and poetics, continue in the contemporary form of the poetics
Listserve, itself seen as a form of multiauthorship.

jacques this is v moving and reminds me of when brathwaite read here a few
years ago he said (apropos the many traumas he suffered in the 1980s,
culminating in being robbed at gunpoint in his own apartment), "i was
murdered that night; the person you see here reading is not me."  gave me
chills.  this is part of what speaks to me in the poetic.  though i could
be (and probably have been) accused of reveling in the spectacle of
(someone else's) abjection, what can one do, if that is a performative
element one feels moved by?  is there a "proper" or appropriate critical or
analytic witness-response.

ANNOUNCING THE DENNIS TURNER MEMORIAL LECTURE

FRIDAY, 21 APRIL

150 GENERAL LECTURES

WAYNE STATE UNIVERSITY, DETROIT

*****

SPEED &SPACE:

THE POLITICS OF VISIBILITY


PROF. ABIGAIL CHILD

FILMMAKER, NEW YORK

SCHOOL OF THE MUSEUM OF FINE ARTS, BOSTON


2:30 PM: SCREENING OF "B/SIDE"

3:15 PM: LECTURE AND DISCUSSION

*****

The Film Studies Program has invited New York filmmaker Abigail Child to
give this year's Turner Lecture. Child's work sustains the formal/poetic
preoccupations of American avant-garde cinema, and yet displays a
revisionist impulse in its focus on sociohistorical concerns.

Her film B/Side uses documentary and avant-garde techniques to address the
social relations and living spaces of Puerto Rican communities. As an essay
on visibility as well as visuality, B/Side refuses the "blindness" of
cultural domination and exclusion, both in the neighborhood and across the
North/South cultural divide.

In addressing questions of the politics and form of independent cinema, it
is significant that Child's lecture and screening comprise the final event
in the year-long "Avant-Garde and Cultural Studies" series. Where mass
cultural forms, particularly in cinema, have been at the forefront of
Cultural Studies, this series reclaims the neglected legacy of the
avant-garde and its historical origins in minority social formations.

Abigail Child is a Guggenheim Fellow whose work has been widely exhibited
in such prestigious venues as the Whitney Museum of American Art Biennial,
the London International Film Festival, and the Ann Arbor Film Festival.
She is also a noted writer of experimental poetry. She teaches at the
School of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston.

OUR GENERATION (For Steve Carey)

I hear the birds of Kenya singing as I write this
for Steve Carey who liked recorded bird song
as I do, the cassette shrill, a door falling-to
on squeaky hinges.  Steve: a grating laugh
of one who was buff-crested, sulphur chested,
lost like me in distant islands of sound
in sonophilia for Kenyas and Britains and native
American woode, with its double-toned wood thrush.
Our own generation as its song.
Calls of 'Will be!', 'Will be!", like a Wilbye
madrigal, every generation in hope
of its many-coloured men and women.
And the fish-eagle's magical feet snatch silver fish
from gold-breeding lakes at all dawns,
as we snatch syllables from standstill moments
and lift that sound, a moment isolated, into sunlight.

Patrick,

Well, isn't a lot of criticism which occurs in the List, for instance, a
language games, and any new criticism has to break its point of references,
assumptions, heros, focus of discourse etc? In your words, it should be
"ineloquent, inarticulate." In my word "irreverent"?

Inelequence is a disjunction, discontinuity between one view and the language
game into which it is projected. Obviously, then, genuinely original poetics
thought must be ineloquent, inarticulated, irreverent.

When seen from this point of view, isn't Wittgenstein's "language-games," so
adulated by most of the present company supportive  authority. If language is
seen as collections of "language-games," then no trespass is possible.

For instance, in the virtual community of this list the phrase
"linguistically innovative" routinely goes together with apologies,
self-abasements for one's views. These two attitudes can not be contradictory
if they are part of the same "language group." But if one kicks the whole
concept of "language-groups" over, debunk Wittgenstein's apparently
"revolutionary" thought (after all, isn't his "Philosophical Investigation" a
reductio absurdum carrying-water extension of British Empiricism in the
pursuit of rejecting German meytaphysics, specifically Hegel?..." Am I being
inarticulate here or irreverent?

The cure to Wittgensteinitis is Walter Benjamin, his elusive, myterious,
constantly changing face dialectics.


"What's so damned annoying about that is not the
oddness of it, but the failure to notice the oddness or the determination
to pretend it's all perfectly ordinary. In what universe does anyone hear a
tenseless narrtive of how I dunno existential the frost on the grass was
this morning when Whoever's Talking went outside with his cup of sanka?"

Patrick,

Are you frustrated with the language-game itself (of which Wittgenstein's
dissatisfaction with main-stream philosophy is one) are you just find poems
about Sanka and nature false?

Van the Man is the PERFECT example of the beauty of inarticulateness. Those
points where his words get tangled, and his *voice* stages the battle
between emotion and articulation... He's someone I often think of when I
read or write. A standard. I can't think of many "stuttering" writers--maybe
Henri Michaux (perhaps more a psychological stuttering than verbal)?

I have a pretty high threshold for eloquence, but like at least an
occasional punctuation of ...self-awareness, I think of it as...some
indication that the author realizes the absurdity of the ongoing
eloquence--as the language races on beautifully, the author finds herself at
the perfect place for a little irony or humor.

Anyone interested in the apparently serious post-IMF protest human
rights violations, extremely abusive handling of men and women arrested,

and the immediate serious political prisoner situation in our very own
Washington, DC should check out the Mobilization for Global Justice
site:

http://A16.org/

If even a small part of this is true, it's pretty disturbing.  There are

numbers to call to add one's voice to the protest, and perhaps
contribute to changing how people are being handled now.

This site also continues information on serious situations around the
globe.

what about that green "Claims for Poetry" book, edited by Donald Hall I
think? I don't have it in front of me, but I know it has "The New
Sentence" in it, and I'm pretty sure it has Edson's "Self Portrait as a
Fat Man: The Care and Feeding of the American Prose Poem." I think I
screwed up the title on the second one.

I could email the contents list later if you are interested.

Jonathan:
You're right of course & I oughtn't generalize so freely. There is some
good stuff out there, and it's help in sorting I wanted more than anything
else. (And I know that, I followed up on my own post in fact just to make
that very point, but that post has never appeared, oh well.) When I wrote
that post I was really annoyed. He sounded like Harold Bloom for cryin out
loud. "Let's get through the actual poem quickly here so we can get on to
the Poet's Ideas." Which brings me to . . .

Steve:
I don't at all like saying that "Fine Work with Pitch and Copper" is ABOUT
poetry. (Well, anyway, I guess you'd say '"about"', which is fine.) I'd be
happy to say this: it's about that something from which Williams's poetry
and what he describes in that poem both spring, something I'd describe
first as a sort of attention Williams "valorizes" -- I don't know that we
can or should bring value into it at all, it's just a fact to start with.
And I'd emphasize that because we could also see something about obsession.
It's lunchtime after all. Williams was certainly driven as a writer, right?
In between patients and then another hour or more at the end of the day
before going to bed, unable _not_ to write really. So I'd say yeah, he
identifies in some sense with the roofer who has to look over the copper
not even say between courses but while still chewing. But Williams gives us
nothing else and I don't want to push any view of it too hard. He doesn't
say whether the roofer is pleased or displeased with the strip he examines,
maybe he'd had trouble with it & was still concerned, maybe he thought it
was the neatest job he'd done and wanted to revisit his triumph, maybe it
was not his work but another's, maybe a youngster & he wanted to see how
well the kid was doing, or maybe an older guy, maybe the guy who taught
him, and he just wanted to admire the other's work, there are a million
possibilities and Williams leaves them all out there. He gives us the bare
fact, man eating lunch, on his break, but looking over the work. I sense
strongly the connection with Williams own work, his own life, but that
doesn't mean this poem is ABOUT poetry. For one thing it cheapens the
roofers, makes them stage props. Maybe I'm giving Williams too much credit,
but it doesn't sound right to me, that he would drag in these men & their
way of life just to talk about himself and his aesthetics.  I'm not trying
to be PC about this, its just doesn't sit with my sense of Williams. -- And
"these men" is not all, since it's an individual he singles out, and that
must be important, it's not "roofers" in the abstract, it's this one guy.
--- Maybe I'm wrong. And as you can see, I agree with Perelman to this
extent, that there is some connection made between poet and roofer. (What a
ridiculous sentence that is.) I just don't like the talk of "equating"
which it seems to me isn't necessary to make the point, and like I said,
it's too Bloomish, it makes it seem like we're done with the poem now that
we know what he was trying to say (and why he didn't just write it all out
in neat prose instead of indirectly and in poetry to boot we'll never
know). So --- we're agreed I think on the "at least partly" as you put it,
and you have nicely put "about" in quotations, just as I put a question
mark in the subject and really we're all of a mind. I think.

But none of this tells me anything I want to know about the poem. That's my
problem, there's so little said about how this small machine made of words
actually works, how it's put together, and what exactly it does. And I
genuinely have no idea how much is possible, how much we can really
"explain". (I revisited, since this thread started, Kenner's lovely reading
of a Williams poem word-by-word in _The Pound Era_. That's a start anyway.)

Hello all --

        This may seem like an absurdly general request, but I've just
accepted a job this Summer teaching creative writing poetry to kids in a
rural summer school environment (attached to a farm; up in Vermont; yes,
I'm a lucky bastard, little to do with skill on my part.)

        Not with the idea of spawning a massive discussion, but more to
get advice on more odd places to look -- how should I go about organizing
"workshops"? As far as I know, I get every other evening with a small
group (self-selected out of the kids -- I'll be teaching the "extra"
class.) I'd like to shake their notions of poetry a little so that they
don't come out the other end with the idea that this is some sort of
esoteric mode of lesire, somewhere up there with pushpin. And, to give
them some tools to take home.

        So, in any case, I figured there were two ways to get beyond the
usual sticking points -- the "craft" way, which goes along the lines of
somewhat artificial exercises to do with tone, diction, sound play, etc.,
and the "cool, excellent" way (what's that?)

        Further: any suggestions on texts to draw from? I was thinking I'd
truck along a jumbled collection, with some non-canonical 20th Century
selections as my own tastes roam. Anybody have other suggestions?

-- Simon

Hi--

A long time ago on the listserv someone referenced a statement of Susan
Howe's in which she said something to the effect of "I don't mind if my
work excludes a majority of readers"--something like that.

Does anyone have the exact quote and the source of it?

Thanks very much,

Rebecca Wolff

PARIS: After a protracted illness, poet Doug Oliver passed away last night,
surrounded by his children (from first marriage); his brother; and wife,
Alice Notley.  Edmund and Anselm Berrigan were still en route to Paris - they
are there now.

The funeral (cremation) is on Thursday. There will be a memorial meeting at
the British Institute  in Paris on Thursday evening.  There will also be a
tribute at the Cambridge (UK) Conference on Contemporary Poetry next weekend.

OUR GENERATION (For Steve Carey)

I hear the birds of Kenya singing as I write this
for Steve Carey who liked recorded bird song
as I do, the cassette shrill, a door falling-to
on squeaky hinges.  Steve: a grating laugh
of one who was buff-crested, sulphur chested,
lost like me in distant islands of sound
in sonophilia for Kenyas and Britains and native
American woode, with its double-toned wood thrush.
Our own generation as its song.
Calls of 'Will be!', 'Will be!", like a Wilbye
madrigal, every generation in hope
of its many-coloured men and women.
And the fish-eagle's magical feet snatch silver fish
from gold-breeding lakes at all dawns,
as we snatch syllables from standstill moments
and lift that sound, a moment isolated, into sunlight.

Douglas Oliver
1937 -- 2000

essential landmarks on the way from the Bay to the Desert : big wind
turbines - sun rising : ostrich farm : field of many little humps/mounds :
enormous cattle yard - smell it long before you see it : display of
various shoes nailed on top of fence posts (I must remember to bring some
along next time to contribute) - easter sunday : stopped at Temecula -
beware of reconstituted frontier towns with speakers mounted along the
main street playing country-western tunes - very loud people - splashing
in the $47! Motel-6 pool - read an interesting article in LA Times about
US (Vietnam-war)-lotteries : bought a few gallons of water at Circle-K for
the morning drive into the desert - it may be cold at night when camping

I want to let folks know about a terrific new book out by Joel Dailey,
_Lower 48_ (Lavender Ink, 1999, 93 pp.).  I try never to miss Joel's
all-too-rare readings in New Orleans ... he's a wonderful poet and reader!

Anselm Hollo says of Joel's book:  "Perfect for both space and time
capsules, [Dailey's poems] embody the delirious overamped atmosphere of
Y2K US, 'where the rubber fits snugly over the arching banana ... / where
the Sunned & the Stunned wait / for excrement to happen.'"

Andrei Codrescu: "Joel Dailey uses an extremely sharp facet of the Languge
Crystal to operate on a flabby world that has had the nerve to be his.  As
unsparing as the jagged edge is, it quakes with laughter even as it cuts."

And Hank Lazer:  "Dailey wanders this world of manipulative consumerism
resisting its hold with his blazing stun-guns of outrage, paranoia,
passion, and comedy, leaving a laminated America del Norte in his wake."

_Lower 48_ is available for $9 from:

Lavender Ink
5568 Woodlawn Pl.
New Orleans, LA 70124


Here's the title poem:

Lower 48

Dear List, these are the two I'm looking into, fyi. It's a community college
class, Maria, with quite a sophisticated body of students, lucky for me.
Poetry Writing: Theme and Variation has proved useful (I think I found it
due to a recommendation on this list) but is a touch overbearing for me. I
think it would work better at the high school level. (Although it's
enormously better than Poemcrazy, which a student recommended.)

ANOMALOUS PARLANCE 3/4: THE WEATHER BY LISA ROBERTSON
Reading: Saturday April 29 8pm
Talk: Sunday April 30 2pm / Launch of RADDLE MOON 18 to follow
Kootenay School of Writing
201 - 505 Hamilton Street
Vancouver BC
$5/$3

Lisa Robertson reads from The Weather, her current book-in-progress, and
delivers a talk on the ideology of weather, with a launch of Raddle Moon 18
to follow.

Lisa Robertson's books and chapbooks include The Apothecary (Tsunami 1991),
XEclogue (Tsunami 1993; rev. New Star 1999), The Badge (The Berkeley
Horse/Mindware 1994), The Descent (Meow 1996), Debbie: an epic (New Star
1997) and Soft Architecture: A Manifesto (Artspeak/Dazibao 1999).  Her
recent poetry and criticism appears in American Book Review, Big Allis,
Boundary2, Mix, Nest: a magazine of interiors, Raddle Moon, Sulphur, Stand
and West Coast Line.  "From the office for Soft Architecture" is serialized
in Front magazine (December 1999-ongoing).  A selection from The Weather is
published in W1.

Issue 18 of Raddle Moon--"bewilderment, transhumance, ghost"--features
writing by Alice Notley, Fanny Howe, Christine Stewart, Lissa Wolsak, Robin
Blaser, Barbara Guest, Maeterlinck, and Kevin Killian; edited by Susan Clark.

...

The dark drinks the light; we omitted the beginning.  The day is longer now;
we're fueled by the thoughtless.  The dry light has never shone on it; we
excerpt effort.  The earth goes gyrating ahead; we frighten the strengths.
The fading woods seem mourning in the autumn wind; we don't regret error.
It is our emotional house.

(from "Wednesday," The Weather)

Part of what I want to ask of the rhetoric of weather, is what other
ideologies may it absorb?  May I cause the weather to absorb the wrong
ideologies?  The issue is not to defamiliarize the language of weather, but
to appropriate its naturalizing function to a history, an utterance, which
is delusional insofar as it is gendered.  A wild dream of parity must have
its own weather and that weather will always have as its structure an
inexhaustible incommensurability.

1999)

not sure why, after waiting a week to see it, my post did not make it to the
list.  did i send to the wrong place?  or was it not deemed relevant?

as it's only my 2nd attempt (the first of which also never made it to the
list),
i have to ask myself what's going on.  or maybe the list moderator can tell me?

indeed, the conference was one of the most important events i've had the
pleasure of attending--in its breadth, its complication & in the way it
signalled for me both a grounding and a point of departure.  grounding--to be
in
the physical presence of these wonderful writers who have critically informed
me
(and those who will--had not read the work of Mark McMorris, Lorenzo Thomas, or
CS Giscombe) in important ways.  departure--the way i was exposed to such
possibilities of discourse and practice--whose challenges to me are still
making
a home for themselves in my thinking.

to attempt to articulate--one of the things that was important to me about this
conference, like Tisa Bryant's panel at the SF Book Festival (which addressed
writers of color)--was in its acknowledgement of the existence, not of a
cannon,
but of a community of cultural workers who challenge--in disparate yet related
ways--the expectations of the "black writer."  the function of innovation for
that writer, the question of audience & the question of struggle.  julie patton
mentioned a sense of having "made it to the party" (rough paraphrase)--a
feeling
of arrival that i  also had named, some hours before.

what probably resonated with me the most was Harryette Mullen's notion of
innovation arising out of struggle.  coming out of a sense of discomfort, being
positioned between discourses  & traditions--an attempt to find/define a
language & culture.  i can't agree with the idea of Baraka's that was
mentioned--that blacks can't help but be innovative--but i think that there is
an interesting intersection there in thinking about the black experience and
the
experience of struggle--and how one comes to witness to that in one's work.

from Mark McMorris' presentation:  poetry is the long curse of the African in
revolt.

more later--but i want to mention the sense of history i was overwhelmed
with--the feeling of kindred--and to thank Jocelyn, Renee, giovanni, SPT, and
all the others--who made this amazing weekend--possible.

ps. Taylor as usual--i appreciate your articulate diligence.

Well, of course.  Does anyone really think that the mainstream is
something completely other.  The mainstream is nothing else but a
record of experimental work, institutionalized.  What have we been
saying about inter-textuality for the last 20 years or so?  The
mainstream is not supposed to be cutting edge, so it's sort of
silly to attack it on that basis.  I don't want it to be cutting edge.
Where would that leave us?  The concept of "experimental" would
be decommisioned.  The mainstream is, at least in part, a museum.
And what painter, or sculptor, in his heart of hearts, doesn't want
to end up in a museum, and change that museum with his/her presence.
Since Mac Low and Bernstein have been so thoroughly accepted by
the mainstream, I'd say that avant garde word since the 1960s is
walking in the front door.

Aha, now I remember who you are, Wm. Jim--I'm so out of it I didn't
connect this new guy to the Buffalo group with the guy I corresponded
briefly with some months back.  Well, now you and I can start another
clique here--or could if it wasn't that I'm going every which way but
sane, so don't have time.

I have time for the following, though: "Why not more attention to visual
poetry?"

(snip)

> Could it be that those with clout have some difficulty

I think that may be part of it.  A bigger part, for me, is that most
English professors are what I call segreceptuals--which means they
have great trouble appreciating art the mixes expressive modalities,
as isual poetry does.  There is also the opposition of poets and
poetry critics who have won an acadominance that they understandably
don't want to give up.  Plus the usual resistance of mediocrities to
anything new.  Or, in this case, new to them.  One other reason is
that too many people associate visual poetry with simple-minded
visual onomatopoiea--e.g., the word "circle" printed with its letters
making a circle.  I'm sure there are other good reasons.

It would depend on the work.  If you'll go to my poetry site, address
below (I hope), and can track down my taxonomy, which I describe in
an essay there, you will find that there are all kinds of artworks that
combine text and graphics without, in my view, being visual poetry.  The
key is whether their visual element significantly increases the
expressive value of their textual element, or something like that.
For some collages using words and pictures, this is the case.
If so, they are visual poems and poetry books are the most appropriate
place for them.

Then there are collages in which genuine poems share a page with visual
images and are enhanced by them, but which, for me, are simply
sophisticatedly illustrated poems, or sophisticatedly captioned
illumages ("illumage" being my word for work of visual art).  It's a
toss-up as to whether they should be in books of poetry or in galleries.

There are also collages with texts that are not poems but which enhance
the visual art that share the page with them.  That is what Picasso and
the other early collagists produced.  They are properly a form of
gallery art--though there's no reason they shouldn't be in books, too.

I think most of the best visual poets of the present create works that
are quite different from collages, Guy R. Beining being one great
exception.

An old thing moved to a different building would be new, I think.  But
poets like Beining are making new kinds of collage.  And being new
isn't that important, anywaze.  Being good is what counts.

Good luck with the Kostelanetz book.  We need one.

This review appeared in the Spring 2000 issue
of Rain Taxi, p. 52.

ART POETIC'
Olivier Cadiot
translated by Cole Swensen
Green Integer ($12.95)

"The pages of a book," according to the French poet Edmond Jabes, "are =
doors. Words go through them, driven by their impatience to regroup." =
The book in this sense does not contain anything (story, meaning); =
rather, in the turning of its pages, it constitutes a performance =
whereby the linguistic field acts in response to the magnetic threshold =
of a certain impatience inherent in language. Perhaps this impatience is =
manifest in our desire to put terms on the interminable (i.e., create =
meaning), or perhaps, more fundamentally, it constitutes the inertial =
regenerative force of the language toward composition. For Olivier =
Cadiot, the potential of this impatience--its charge, its =
ambiguity--provides the gravity on which the art of poetry spins. =
Cadiot's Art Poetic', translated from the French by Cole Swensen, =
exemplifies Jabes's tenet: driven by language, its pages enliven the =
cognitive spectrum in which grammatical constructs present themselves. =
Both a poem and a poetics, the text traces the bandwidth of the language =
act via a series of systematic experiments which emulate a =
mathematician's iterative attempts to map out a territory that comes =
closer and closer to a "real" description of that space. The area under =
the curve vibrates with what Chomsky called the "deep structure" of the =
syntactical surface; Art Poetic' intentionally foregoes narrative and =
exposition in order to animate the grammatical field--to allow it to =
refer to its own making as its projections are reoriented, reiterated, =
and resected again and again--and, as such, to provide a view onto the =
workings of that deep structure. The book's 15 chapters each enact a =
singular innovation that pivots on varying a selected set of elements in =
the grammatical construction--testing the expectations of that =
construction, the ambiguities. To expose the composition--words, =
punctuation, syntax, graphics--as purely as possible to its own inherent =
impatience: this, the effect of Cadiot's poetic work.  --Kim Fortier

I couldn't care less about Benjamin and Wittgenstein, but this idea of
someone's talking going outside with his cup his cup of sanka is neat.
Yeah, I know I misread it, but it was an easy misread to make and I

i like both polish and roughness, esp in extremes.  for polish that also
thematizes the problems of over-aestheticization, Hawthorne's short stories
can't be beat.  others have mentioned good examples of stuttering texts
--this --the cracking voice, the rough-timbred tone --have a worthy place
in both Jewish (cantorial) and African American (blues, Hendrix's
distortion, etc) aestetic tradition.  i also like clumsiness, as in
"doggerel," or in some of C Bernstein's poetry and prose, where it's
deliberate and used for humorous and polemical ends.

Simon,

You might try a variant of the "craft" way of instruction, and have your
students write imitations.  You trot in with a you like and know
something about and find interesting, explain the engineering of the
thing to them, and give them a fairly explicit assignment in which you
ask them to do something along the same lines.  This comes off feeling
slightly less 'artificial' than most "craft" excercises, and raises the
bar a bit.

I mean, none of your students is going to write like the mature Wallace
Stevens, but if you show them "Thirteen Ways" and explain something
about how it works, they'll have more interesting models than one
another.

An example: show them "Journey of the Magi," point out the interesting
bits about the narrator and the narratee, the intertextuality, the
foreshadowing of he cruxifiction, etc.  If you do it well, they'll ooh
and ahh at all the things they wouldn't have seen on their own.  Then
give them an assignment where they do several of the things Eliot did
(you should probably be specific about this).

At some point it is likely that a student will bitch about you
suppressing his originality.  You can tell him that immature poets
emulate, mature poets steal, and no one has been original since Homer.

Some pieces I've had college freshman work with:

Gary Snyder, parts of "Myths and Texts"
Stein, "Picasso" (call it a prose poem)
Eliot, "Journey of the Magi"
Stevens, "Study of Two Pears"
Robert Kroetsch, "Sketches of a Lemon"
Charles Simic, "My Shoes"

One could get wilder or play it even safer, of course.

Good luck -- high school level teaching is (I'm told) a tough gig.

Political Poem


Some think Castro is a yahoo and some think his power comes from his
mistakes. It's a rancorous debate that will either influence major officials
or create throngs of pre-owned opinions, both of which are a bit
uncomfortable for our bodies--so ignorant yet so wrapped up--and for agents
embarrassed by the price of intelligence.

But, hell, bigger cost is the thing. It's hotter than satellites and
educational programs, and it's going all national. Isn't increase measured
by having babies, giving thanks? What else is there to look for?

We are here cooking and reading and napping. It's only the representatives
who are acting like buggy software or shoppers cut off from caffeine. I want
to call them jackasses and lazy bastards. But...

Against this backdrop, labor looks like a ditto. The traffic is directed in
whole or in part into time and space, it's harried partners. It will crash
deadlines and promise July. Next year, double it. Thousands will get hacked,
their own private silos of porn bugged, and the firewalls will jump up
faster than you can bomb Baghdad.

But, still, there is some value in trade, and in suffering, which is a kind
of daily justice. Those of us in the plains want the mountains and the sea,
while those on the coasts want nothing other than their salt-cured selves.
We all want money. The implication is that we will probably all kill each
other and everything around us. It's not getting any cooler.

It's grown past the point of toys designed to school terrorists. Not much
rises above the system of looking inside. Everyone's head is their own new
government, and getting out of bed makes me feel like my stomach is going to
pop open and make me reluctant mother-, absentee father-, disowned brother-
and weeping sister-in-flight to my one-and-only country gone postal.

Me too--in fact, I'm attracted to works that _use_ inarticulateness to
formulate a kind of anti-eloquence that is itself of course very eloquent.
Which is I think what you're saying.  The Van Morrison analogy is very good
(another example would be "Listen to the Lion" on _St. Dominick's Preview_,
with its scary fits of growling and muttering that are so beautiful also).
Davis, Monk, Coltrane: definitely.  Also Erik Satie, Robert Johnson
sometimes, early Cramps (esp. their cover of "Human Fly"), and Jonathan
Richman (who really extends the stutter/slur into an entire range of
expression in itself).

I'm very interested in this because I'm preparing a paper on
inarticulateness in 2nd-gen (mostly) New York School poets for the NPF
conference on American Poetry in the 60s this June in Maine.  I'm looking,
for instance, at Ron Padgett's "smuh" in _Great Balls of Fire_, or more
generally the aphasic aspects of Brainard's, Padgett's, Elmslie's comix,
etc.

But Milton is all _about_ that fear of sophistry/duplicity!  Just look at
the council of devils in Book II of _PL_, or Satan's overtures to Eve, or
Eve's to Adam, and try to look at God's speeches to the Son or the angels,
or Raphael's to Adam, without seeing all kinds of disturbing implications.
Not that Milton necessarily intended it that way, but that's partly the
point: there were aspects of his work that he _wasn't_ totally in control
of, and in trusting them to take him where he thought he wanted to go, he
created some of the most powerful poetry ever. (Sorry, but I just had to
jump in to defend old Uncle Milty.)  As for the language writers, it seems
like sometimes you face the problem of duplicity from another angle: there's
sometimes the gnawing suspicion that the poet is using disjunctiveness to
mask the absence of actual poetry, that you're sometimes getting
pretend-poetry produced by a throw of the dice, but which still claims the
status of political or epistemological critique, or something equally
important.  (Please note the repeated use of "sometimes.")

Yes--he crams eloquent particles into huh?-shaped clusters, resulting in an
ineloquence that can be described in terms of the anti-eloquence I mentioned
above.

>A voice that can't seem to stick to one train of thought

But what about Virginia Woolf, for instance, who combines that
wandering-attention effect with a smoothy rendered narrative continuity
somehow, or John Ashbery, who does something very similar?  With those two,
you're definitely talking about an simultaneously eloquent and digressive
effect that goes beyond the level of the individual sentence.

>...it turns out sentences [as per Frost] are not enough. You need

Here, Gertrude Stein's contention that sentences are not emotional, but
paragraphs are, seems relevant.  Of course, she responded to this by fitting
whole paragraphs into single sentences, as Silliman points out in _The New
Sentence_, e.g., "A dog which you have never had has sighed."  I think it's
interesting to trace the logic of how this counts as a paragraph in terms of
the eloquent/ineloquent dichotomy we're testing here: does the condensation
result in an increase of eloquence?  Does the absurdity of the claim that it
_is_ a paragraph figure in this increase?  Put another way, could eloquence
be contextual (or extra-textual) rather than something actually physically
glowing there in the text itself?

But mightn't there in fact be language-sounds?  Isn't language poetry, even,
a kind of manifestation of a particular language-sound, even if that sound
is founded to some extent on a wrenching of other language-sounds from their
particular language games in the way you say?  And as such, doesn't it
depend on a fiction of communication every bit as artificial as the
frost-on-the-grass & cup-of-sanka kind of poetry?  Your point is well taken,
however, that depending on the context of whatever genre or form you're
talking about, the fiction of the "tenseless narrative" can be extremely
annoying.  In a good novel, for instance, I might have no problem with the
fiction of the omniscient narrator telling me what's going through the heads
of the characters, or even espousing his/her/its philosophy of the world,
because I'm always aware that the convention allowing such a narrator is
being consciously wielded in a way that leads to interesting fictional
speculations (again, if its a _good_ novel).  I have a similar reaction to
yours, however, whenever I see a production of Shakespeare in which actors,
often brilliant actors, try to make the iambic pentameter dialogue or
monologue sound as though it's just occurring to the character as he/she
speaks, inflecting it with casual, naturalistic vocal rhythms, etc.  And of
course, this describes _most_ productions of Shakespeare.  At the Globe or
Swan, these speeches would bave been much more blatantly just that:
_speeches_, written and spoken in the awareness of being apprehended as
speeches in some way commenting on or enhancing the action of the play, but
not pretending to be representations of actual spontaneous words coming out
of the mouths of their speakers the moment they're formed.  The fiction of
the plot and the admitted speechiness of the speeches exist side by side,
but only overlap in limited ways.  And that's why live Shakespeare
invariably sucks in the present day.  Anyways, that's how I see it.

>There's also the pretence to eloquence that's so prevalent in trade-

OK, but what is "real" eloquence?  Isn't all eloquence, by definition,
sounds stirred into associations with certain moods and feelings,
independently of the content?  I mean, I think I know and agree with what
you're saying about tradehouse poetry, but I don't want to foresake the
usefulness--the _value_ of "sound, of stirring associations of ...
eloquence" in the case of really interesting writing, and I think it needs
to be carefully worked out how the two cases are different.  Especially
interesting to me is how writing can use the effect of a "pretence to
eloquence" self-consciously to undermine the kinds of bad eloquence we hate.
  And I don't just mean irony here, at least I don't think I do.  I'm
thinking of the tone, for example, in Kenneth Koch's writing, where faux
loftiness manages in the end to redeeem itself as "real" loftiness.  Part of
what I'm trying to work out for myself these days is how it makes that
transition.

Well, that last bit of nastiness was uncalled for, but still pretty
funny.  Sorry if my appreciation for that marvelous London audience
was improperly put.  So I'll say it again.  That audience made me
feel welcome, and it meant quite a lot to me.  As we know, the world
is filled with little snots.  By the way, you claim that I did not
say "then" that not every vp fits the mold.  You're incorrect.  There
it is, in my original post, line seven.

To the Poetics List:

Announcing the latest volume in the series Modern and
Contemporary Poetics, edited by Charles Bernstein and Hank
Lazer

Discrepant Engagement
Dissonance, Cross-Culturality, and Experimental Writing
Nathaniel Mackey

This highly regarded and frequently referenced work of
literary criticism is essential to any study of avant garde
poetics.

Nathaniel Mackey addresses the poetry and prose of a
number of authors not commonly grouped together:
black writers from the United States and the Caribbean
and the so-called Black Mountain poets. Although they
are seemingly disparate, these writers are united by
their experimentation with style and form. Mackey, an
important contemporary poet and critic, focuses on the
experimental aspects of their work rather than on its
subject matter or authorship to show that they all share
an implied critique of conventional poetic practices.

Mackey analyzes the work of Black Mountain poets
Robert Duncan, Robert Creeley, and Charles Olson,
African American poets Amiri Baraka and Clarence
Major, and Caribbean writers Edward Kamau
Brathwaite and Wilson Harris. He frequently brings the
work of these authors into dialogue and juxtaposition,
noting the parallels and counterpoint that exist among
writers normally separated by ethnic, temporal, or
regional boundaries. By insisting that their
experimentation unites these writers rather than
marginalizes them, Mackey questions traditional notions
that underlie conventional perceptions and practice.

=93Insisting on the political importance of radical innovation
without the trappings of intellectual fashion, tempered by
an awareness of the historical scale of his assertions,
and challenging liberal notions of cultural pluralism and
artistic opposition, Nathaniel Mackey makes an
important, sophisticated contribution to current debates
about cultural diversity and the political relevance of
experimental writing.=94=97Contemporary Literature

=93Nathaniel Mackey has accomplished his task
admirably. Discrepant Engagement demands from us
an openness to alternative frames of reference and a
recognition of the ways in which traditional categories
restrict our own perceptions of the potential for
intertextuality among cultures, literary schools, races,
regions, and rubrics.=94=97African American Review

Nathaniel Mackey is Professor of Literature at the
University of
California, Santa Cruz.

Rebecca,

As I recall, it was about a year ago that you and I had a debate about
class on this list, and I brought up the point about Howe not caring about
her audience.  I believe she says it in an interview.  Try:

Foster, Edward, ed.  "Susan Howe."  Postmoder Poetry: The Talisman
Interviews. Hoboken, NJ: Talisman House, 1994.

or

Keller, Lynn.  "Interview with Susan Howe."  Contemporary Literature  36
(1995): 1-34.

Good luck,
Granj

but this is a colloquium and you are encouraged to participate

---------------------------------------

REGISTRATION

Registration can be unnecessarily time consuming, time we do not have.

Registration, therefore, will be conducted by post.

You are asked to register in advance for the colloquium by sending a cheque
for £10 (£5 concessions) - sterling payments only - payable to
"Lawrence Upton" to:

32 Downside Road,
Sutton,
Surrey SM2 5HP

to arrive before 17th May 2000.

On arrival at the colloquium you will be given a colloquium badge which you
are asked to wear throughout the day.

---------------------------------------------

REFRESHMENTS

Tea and coffee will be provided at registration and during the afternoon.
The possibility of biscuits is being investigated.

It can be difficult to get lunch in the area on a Saturday because many of
the cafes are closed.

You are welcome to bring your own lunch &, in addition, we are making
arrangements to have sandwiches, decent and decently-priced sandwiches
brought in i.e. you have to pay for them but we'll arrange for them to be
delivered. Let us know if this is of interest and as soon as the details are
received, we'll be in contact.

N.B. Tea and coffee will be served in a room adjacent to the colloquium room
and lunch may be taken there. If it's a fine day, we can go into the square.

-----------------------------------------

BOOKSTALL

There will be a staffed bookstall running through much of the day, though it
will close early for stock-taking.

It will be run by Paul Holman and Bridget Penney who ran the stall at the
3rd Sub Voicive Colloquium.

It is hoped that it will be open for business during registration; but it
will close before the end of the colloquium for stock-taking. It is hoped
that invoices will be settled on the day; unsold books will be returned.

No responsibility can be taken for publications left at the colloquium after
6 p.m. on 20th May 2000.

Publishers are invited to participate on the understanding that stock must
be delivered and collected on the day between 10 a.m. and 6 p.m. and that a
40% discount will be deducted.

The following simple rules apply for our mutual benefit.

* Do NOT send your publications to Sub Voicive Poetry or to the venue. You
must bring them and collect them yourself on the day or arrange for someone
else to do that on your behalf before 6 p.m.

* Don't bring millions of books. Be selective and realistic. Select
publications which are relevant to what is going on during the day and the
likely audience.

* Make sure that the price is clearly on the book. Post-it notes are fine,
but you must supply them.

* Supply a list of the books supplied - incl. qty. i.e. a delivery note.

* Supply an invoice with the books.

Response suggestions - write your cheque and send it off; then, if you are a
publisher, prepare your contribution to the bookstall

Yes, Jonathan Richman. And if we get to mention Vanman, hey, Bob Dylan is
king of this in my opinion, as evidenced in insane crossrhyming that I like
to plug into the heads of my dear lit students every single semester it is
on the poetry terms quiz, dudes.

Poems about sanka and nature are real!

Sentences are not emotional paragraphs are! And exclamatory markings!

To me it's not even as organized as stuttering.

It's the, to really stick a humpty dumpty leg out, this f*cked up and at
moments mundane eloquence that is the only thing that can make any gesture
toward spirituality seem at all feasible; one gal's opinion or operating
procedure.

Nother line of thread, students may indeed find themselves and each other
more interesting models than Homer or Stevens or whomever their teacher's
fave is, yes ain't it so?

Kasey, your post on inarticulate range to eloquenceory here in this issue is
fabulous. I don't quite see Virginia how she fits in exactly tho -- there is
something self-contained in her works so that I never can quite think of her
as a Modernist, personally, tho I am utterly in love with her. Esp THE YEARS.


As for the language writers, it seems
>like sometimes you face the problem of duplicity from another angle: there's
>sometimes the gnawing suspicion that the poet is using disjunctiveness to
>mask the absence of actual poetry, that you're sometimes getting
>pretend-poetry produced by a throw of the dice, but which still claims the
>status of political or epistemological critique, or something equally
>important.  (Please note the repeated use of "sometimes.")
>
>>Now it seems to me that the disjunctive paratactic style in poetry
>>is at least this: a resistance to eloquence. I think you can see that
>>particularly in Michael Palmer, because the individual sentences are
>>often noticably elegant, but put together to forestall an accumulation
>>of eloquence.

I am not trying to insult anyone when I say from my familiarity with his
work (incomplete) Palmer is very much driving toward eloquence, tho not the
tricky cliche type of, oh some poet laureates. I mean R Pinsky has a poem in
which he pees, somehow this is vulgarity? I don't know, the terms mix for me
here. What exactly can a resistance to eloquence per se mean politically?
poetically?

I'm glad this conversation is still going, however slowly and locally.

yes, having made it to the party, the feeling lingers, like hearing Chaka
Khan sing "A Night In Tunisia".

and the resonance felt by those invited but didn't/couldn't come?

I asked a question about the generation of crit/other discussion of
innovative writers of color, basically, "Where's the work?", this directed
"inside" and "out".  Some great work has come out by N. Mackey, P. Naylor
and A. L. Nielsen, and more is rumored to come from J. Spahr, and this
heartens me, that investigations about work across gender race, class, time,
movement(s), regions, etc. can come about, will continue to be published.

I've since asked myself, and have been asked, about whom I'd like to write
on, whose poetic work I'd like to critically discuss.  With all the books in
my tiny apartment (threatening to crush me like poor Burgess Meredith in
that horrific Twilight Zone episode of yore),  I have yet to come up with an
answer that feels right, inspired, honest, passionate, not just dutiful or
purely political.

I'm reminded of Erica Hunt impressing upon listeners the importance of a
reading strategy.  What should of course follow is a writing strategy.
How do we come to write about writers writing?  By chance?  Infatuation?
Affinity?  Academic credit?  (Here I'm musing about how some of the best
books by Black women I own were recovered at the yard sale of some women's
studies chick about to move out of town, but I digress with a double-edged
smirk.  How cheap the books, how sad the sidewalk...)

I'm also reminded of Hunt's appearance in a film of Abigail Child's, so
maybe I can start there, by reading them side by side.  There's the shelf,
and their books, about to fall...

A quick list poem from paperback titles improperly stacked:

sonnets from the portuguese the black expatriates
film as art all night visitors another country three negro classics
 the prose poem the colossus dream of the red chamber dandelion wine
the waiting years we be word sorcerers tales from the decameron
tomas the dispossessed the selected writings of Gertrude Stein
les liaisons dangereuses the metamorphoses wild seed talking back
when the moon waxes red ain't i a woman liliane corregidora cane
the book of orgasms babel-17 dices or black bones krik? krak!
hue and cry the souls of black folk things fall apart thousand cranes
paroles masters of the dew walking through clear water (in a pool painted
black)
anne frank intimacy nectar in a sieve
the mismeasure of man
distance without distance gorilla my love

I'm puzzling out the strategy of what I've read, and what should come
after...it's like asking "who am I?  "what am I made of?"

Struggling with discomfort, with life, in writing: we all do this and read
it being done.  How does one expand the repertoire of the kindred?

        Henry James stuttered--quite amazing when you think he dictated
many of his later works!
        James dictatated to a typist--thinking of him producing those long
clause filled sentences, with the window open (passersby noted they heard
him) and faced with a poker faced Scotsman who irked James by showing no
emotion to the author's most elaboratley conceived effects, there seems to
be a germ of projective verse at work . . .
        After all, Olson noted that "in BILLY BUDD, the stutter is the
plot" . . .

        The stuttering in R&B music is mellisma--and came often from
Gospel singing--
        It is also very common in Country Western music--and Blues
harmonica, let alone voices and guitar--

        There are a lot of ways to create visual stutters--a simple one is
by manipulating a stroboscope--or not maninipulating it--also "flicker"
films--

        lights from police cars--etc--

        (I should note that Edith Wharton discovered that when reciting
Whitman, his favorite poet, James did not stutter.)

        The question of eloquence is interesting--have always wondered
when listening to some "eloquent" passage--Shakespeare, say--or many
others of fame & note--how much the writer was propelled (not to mention,
of course, the actor/performer)--by the sheer energy of language, as much
as by the convictions expressed--

        I.E.--there are forms of eloquence that are non-- ironic--totally
caught up in the surge of expression--"beyond words"

        zaum and sound poetry have explored many avenues of this

        and often use visual poems/forms as notation

        never will forget attending Pentecoastal tent meetings in Kentucky
over a period of days and seeing/hearing people burst into paroxysms and
speaking in tongues--

        (there's a great early Steve Reich piece, tape loopings of street
preacher, which builds from a stuttering effect to---ecstasy? paranoia
etc--tape recordings can be well used for these effects)

        one ccc---cccc---co-ud---ggg ggo oo--oonnn . . . go on . .

Kasey,

I'm very eager to hear your paper.  Seeing the 2nd gen NYS as performing a
kind of poetics of inarticulateness is potentially a fascinating topic, I
think.  But isn't the 2nd gen NYS situated between 2 poetries of
hyper-articulateness--1st gen NYS & LangPo?  It was the 1st generation's
articulateness, after all, that made O'H, Ash, et. al. useful middlemen for
the Ab Ex painters--many of whom (think of Pollock) were literally &
painfully inarticulate.  The 1st gen gave Ab Ex a voice, so to speak (& Frank
O'Hara's production falls off in the mid-60s when his role as a mouthpiece
for Ab Ex diminishes), whereas the 2nd gen doesn't play this role at all in
relation to painting's inarticulateness--even mimicing, instead, the
inarticulateness of Warhol, say (as in Padgett's "Sonnet to Sleep" or
"Nothing in that Drawer").  Issues of class & sexual orientation also seem
relevant in this connection in determining  what can and cannot be said.  In
fact, the hyper articulateness of the 1st gen NYS is a product, in part, of
privilege (Harvard educations)--but also--that is, the display & the ends to
which articulateness is meant to perform--as a form of subserviance (as
cultural middlemen) resulting from the disparity in status between themselves
and the Ab Ex painters.  In this instance, articulateness--**rather than
inarticulateness**-- can even be seen to be a form of abjection, perhaps.

--Jacques

PS: my vote for rambling eloquence goes to Thomas Bernhard--Wiitgenstein's
Nephew & The Loser--just to name my 2 favorite of his novels-- are each
extraordinary, aphasic monologues.

Yeah  that one really overwhelms me, I mean literally 9 out of 10 times I
listen to it I get a lump in my throat and tears in my eyes. It gets to me.
It is such a courageous performance, the way he goes all the way back to
the noisemaking & experimentation of a toddler (not unlike my own son Tim)
and he's so free about it, this man is so far, and maybe just for the
moment just when he's really into the music, is so far past normal concerns
like embarrassment, looking ridiculous. Who else could do that? (Actually
he might be like that a lot of the time: I was flipping through a Henry
Rollins book a couple weeks ago and Rollins is talking about the time he
met Van Morrison and telling the interviewer that he's a very hard man to
know, very intense -- okay, this is someone _Rollins_ finds intense, whoa.)
(I guess Jonathan Richman is another guy who is resolutely unembarassed.)

So that's a lot of it for me, that fearlessness or courage, whichever it
is. Now there are values there that were bandied about a lot in the heyday
of suicidal confessionals, but it doesn't seem like quite the same thing to
me & I'd love to nail down the difference. When Robert Lowell more-or-less
admits he's an asshole in verse, maybe I just don't quite buy it cause it
seems like he's _still_ trying to manipulate us, you know? But by telling a
little of the truth. You don't have to lie to manipulate. (One of Freud's
favorite jokes, wasn't it? "Why do you lie, telling me you're going to
Krakow so I'll think you're going to Warsaw when in fact you _are_ going to
Krakow?") So like that for, say Lowell, but I don't feel like Van Morrison
is trying to get anything from me.

I didn't want to cut off the disclaimers, but the meat of this for me is in
the middle, where it always is (I hear).

Some of you who are kind enough to read my posts may gradually form a
picture of where they're coming from, so to speak, since come on I'm just
working out my personal problems in public because they happen to connect
up here & there with more or less theoretical & public sorts of problems of
poetics. Well don't they all, I guess.

And what we're talking about now is very close to ground zero. Almost
everything I've written in the decade or more since I first thought I'd try
writing poetry, eventually if not immediately leaves me uncertain whether
I've got a poem or something that _sounds_ like a poem. Sound generally
being important in poetry, it looks like that might be nonsensical. Maybe
it is. Didn't Duke Ellington say, "If it sounds good, it is good"? Only now
& then I'll see something in print that I can best describe as "sounds like
poetry but isn't", so it's a distinction I find reinforced by experience.
(Except that I might still be wrong.) And then there's a question about
whether you're reading a fraud or someone who can't tell the difference. Or
at least not all the time. It's not so uncommon after all for someone who
has written great poems also to have written some sort of self-plagiarisms,
"in the manner of ..." themselves in fact. It happens. ---- So, the
"pretend-poetry" idea is basically an obsession with me, for good & ill.
But anyway I think it's clear why freedom is such a big issue for me and
comes up in talking about Van Morrison, or Kerouac, or jazz, almost all the
time.

Kasey also asks me, in a nutshell, how I distinguish fake eloquence from
real eloquence, which is the same sort of deal, and maybe it's a
distinction that can't be held long. Except that sometimes you're conned by
a master and sometimes you're taken by a cheap crook.

The rest of Kasey's thoughts on language-sounds & so on deserve a response
I don't have time for right now, but I'll try soon.

Oh yeah-- didn't someone mention Pharoah Sanders? To me one of the great
transcendent moments of recording history is on the Heart is a Melody album
(rec. live at Keystone Korner) when he's playing "Ole" and he takes the
saxophone from his mouth and I guess the word is "screams"  the theme (and
then goes on, alternating voice and saxophone for a few bars). To reach a
point where the instrument isn't necessary, wow. (What's that famous
Richman line about learning how to play "with nothing, with our guitars
broken, in the rain", something like that.) And it's reminiscent of how
Morrison on "Listen to the Lion" seems to dig deep down for the most
primitive source of the music...

Thanks all.

In Patrick's otherwise very entertaining and informative improvisation
on jazz (I'd throw Sanders in there also, but that's just me), he
names Derrida as one of thinkers he no longer likes (or words to that
effect).  In no way do I mean this as a criticism of Patrick's point
of view, but it is more than clear that Derrida is no longer
fashionable in America.  A recent editorial (or letter, or review--
don't remember which) in the small press review referred to
 deconstruction as french poodle
theory.  This sort of thing does little to advance the discussion,
though it perhaps speaks to a long tradition of American anti-
intellectualism and narrowmindedness.  Derrida doesn't need me to
defend him; that's for sure.  But when  Freud fell out of favor,
there was at least a considered response to his structuring of
the psyche.  When Existentialism (earlier french poodle stuff
that informed Hemingway's art, to name just one) fell out of favor,
it fell to a considered rebuttal that interrogated certain a priori
assumptions.  I have yet to see a sensible argrument mounted against
Derrida's evaluation of the metaphysical tradition.  What I have
read are vague resistances aimed at what can only be described as
a caricature of Derrida and deconstruction, written by those who
clearly have not read him extensively and/or do not understand
what they have read.  The few coherent arguments I've come across
fail almost immediately because they rely always on some version
of a unified self (and self-identical premises) a priori.  In other
words, their argument amounts to "I don't like what I'm hearing
so I'm covering my ears.  I'm more than willing to let Derrida go
down in flames, but so far I don't feel any heat.  Exactly
what's wrong with what he has said?  Where is the threat that so
many people seem to perceive? Any takers?  Once again, not a
criticism of Patrick whose post focuses on other matters.  But it
did give me an  opportunity  to raise this issue.

Wait a minute!  That Bob Grumman?  Now I know . . . (just kidding,
Bob).  Gee, why don't more people know who I am?  After all, I was
a minor rock n' roll star in the 70s (now that is a joke!)  But
seriously, folks, it's good to be in contact with you, Bob.  Hope
your health improves expotensionally (tension is good for art).
As far as I'm concerned, you're a major player.  By the way, I
agree with everything you say here, above, or below, or wherever
we're hangin' these days.  When was the last time that happened?
Frightening!  By and by the way, Guy has a piece in the new issue
of my rag uh, mag, BLACKBOX, if we just get the damn thing printed.
I've done a few visual poems, but mostly I'm at the other end
of the experimental gyre (not sure if I'm just starting out or
falling apart)--french symbolists through  Eliot/Stevens
(and some Pound), dragging into the 21st a bit of the Beats as
I come forward, not forgetting Whitman/Williams, the New York
School, with a special fondness for de Sade and Lautreamont.
In other words, I make garbage piles.  But just because I find
my challenges elsewhere doesn't mean I donna like vp.  I do, I do.
I still think that it's a big boat, and we're all swimming against
the tide of all that boring narrative, this happened to my
grandfather verse.  All my best

Ah, jeez, now I feel guilty about that rather adolescent slam of
conventional narrative poets.  Not fair.  Different sensibility,
different methodology.  I confess to liking, quite a lot, some of
those narratives, even a few about relatives.  Lee Young Lee's
"Persimmons" is a fine poem.  "Sex Without Love" (Sharon Olds)
is pretty cool too.  But ultimately, neither poem is messy enough
for me.  I feel similarly about those visual poems I don't like
(as opposed to those I do like).  Too neat.  Too crafted and
crafty.  When a poem is done, the poet should be drenched in shit.
Or at least beer.

                     DAVID LEHMAN and An Evening with GERALD STERN
                           FEATURE POETS for MAY POETRY SERIES

        Mt. Kisco, NY:  May begins with a double feature week of award
winning poets at the Creative Arts Caf=E9
        Poetry Series at Northern Westchester Center for the Arts.
Monday May 1st, DAVID LEHMAN,
        the award winning poet and noted editor of The Best American
Poetry series begins May&rsquo;s poetry
        events with a reading and book signing followed by an OPEN
MIKE.           Friday, May 5th
        National Book Award Recipient GERALD STERN celebrates his newest
book LAST BLUE at
        a special event  - AN EVENING WITH GERALD STERN.   Each reading
begins at 7:30 PM.

        In January 1996, David Lehman began writing a   poem nearly
every day. During his longest streak, Mr.
        Lehman wrote a poem on 140 consecutive  days.    In celebration
of National Poetry Month, April 1998, in
        addition to their daily poem, Poetry Daily  presented a poem
written by David Lehman each   day that
        month.    Mr. Lehman's poems, some of which are past   "daily"
poems, have appeared in The Yale  Review,
        The Paris Review, Michigan Quarterly  Review, Boulevard,
Shenandoah, Lingo, Verse, Brilliant Corners,
        Boston Review, and Boston  Book Review. His daily poems have now
been gathered in a  book, The Daily
        Mirror, a title taken from a New   York City tabloid that folded
as a result of a  calamitous 1962 newspaper
        strike.

         David Lehman was born in New York City in 1948. He attended
Cambridge University as a  Kellett Fellow
        and went on to receive his  doctorate in English at Columbia
University, where  he was Lionel Trilling's
        research assistant.   He is the Series Editor of The Best
American Poetry Series, and author of three previous
        books of  poems, including Valentine Place (Scribner,  1996) and
Operation Memory (Princeton, 1990).  His
        prose books include The Last Avant-Garde: The Making of the New
York School of Poets,  Signs of the
        Times: Deconstruction and the  Fall of Paul de Man, and The Big
Question. He is also co-editor with Star
        Black  of  The KGB Bar a collection of poems from their popular
NYC Poetry Series.  Not since the days of
        the beatniks have poetry readings been so popular. In   New York
City.  The series, named by New York
        magazine as the best,  is a  &ldquo;simple, no-frills affair,
packed with a standing-room-only crowd intent on
        [hearing] the most famous poets in America mixed with the
up-and-comers." David and Star Black have
        jointly directed the KGB Bar poetry  series since its inception
in 1997.

        Mr. Lehman is on the core faculty of the graduate writing
programs at Bennington College and the New
        School for Social Research. He divides his time  between Ithaca,
New York, and New York City.   David
        Lehman is also the general editor of  University of Michigan
Press's Poets on Poetry Series. In addition,
        University of Michigan Press  has published the revised edition
of Ecstatic Occasions, Expedient Forms,
        edited by Mr. Lehman, that comprises poems and commentary  by 85
poets, each of whom discusses the
        form of  the poem and what occasioned it. The book includes
examples of sonnets, villanelles, pantoums,
        prose poems, and such ad hoc forms as  a poem in the form of an
index to a nonexistent   book and a poem
        in the form of a baseball lineup.


        Gerald  Stern was winner of the 1998 National Book Award for
Poetry for his volume This Time: New and
        Selected Poems.  The book was lauded as an important work from a
major poet, &ldquo;an exuberant
        collection that delves deeply into the anguish and ecstasy of
the world.&rdquo;   In his new book, Last Blue
        Stern further explores the weight of history and the buoyancy of
memory, the casual miracles of relationships,
        and his irrevocable connection to the natural world.

        Gerald Stern was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, in 1925. His
books of poetry include: Last Blue; This
        Time: New and Selected Poems  (W. W. Norton, 1998), which won
the National Book Award; Odd Mercy
        (1995); Bread Without Sugar (1992), winner of the  Paterson
Poetry Prize; Leaving Another Kingdom:
        Selected Poems(1990); Two Long Poems (1990); Lovesick (1987);
Paradise Poems (1984); The Red Coal
        (1981), which received  the Melville Caine Award from the Poetry
Society of America; Lucky Life, the 1977
        Lamont Poetry Selection of The Academy of American Poets, which
was nominated for a National Book
        Critics Circle Award; and  Rejoicings (1973). His honors include
the Paris Review's Bernard F. Conners
        Award, the Bess Hokin Award from Poetry, the Ruth Lilly Prize,
four National Endowment for the Arts
        grants, the Pennsylvania Governor's Award for Excellence in the
Arts, the Jerome J. Shestack Poetry Prize
        from American Poetry Review, and fellowships from The Academy of
American Poets, the Guggenheim
        Foundation, and the Pennsylvania Council on the Arts. For many
years a teacher at the University of Iowa
        Writers' Workshop, he lives in Easton, Pennsylvania, and   New
York City.

        There is a suggested donation of  $7.00; $5.00 for seniors and
students for the David Lehman reading.  The
        admission for An Evening with Gerald Stern is $10.00.  There is
a reception following each reading. Cindy
        Beer-Fouhy, Director of Literary Arts,  will host both events.

        The Creative Arts Caf=E9 Poetry Series is sponsored, in part, by
the New York State Council on the Arts and
        the Bydale Foundation.

        The  Northern Westchester Center for the Arts is located at 272
        N. Bedford Road, Mt. Kisco, NY.  For information and
        directions, please call 914 241 6922.

Thanks Grant. I have an extremely bad memory, for debates, quotes, all of
it. Together with Frances Richard, non-fiction editor of Fence, I am
working on putting together a symposium on, roughly, class and subjectivity
for Issue 6 of Fence, due out in the Fall, and I wanted to find the Howe
quote to use as stimulus for responses from our participants.

Thanks again,

Rebecca

Rebecca,

As I recall, it was about a year ago that you and I had a debate about
class on this list, and I brought up the point about Howe not caring about
her audience.  I believe she says it in an interview.  Try:

Foster, Edward, ed.  "Susan Howe."  Postmoder Poetry: The Talisman
Interviews. Hoboken, NJ: Talisman House, 1994.

or

Keller, Lynn.  "Interview with Susan Howe."  Contemporary Literature  36
(1995): 1-34.

Good luck,
Granj

MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII

I'm not a particularly vehement detractor or defender of Derrida.  If his
work has fallen out of favor it is probably because of the dogmatism of
some of his American proteges. Deconstructionists were accused (rightly
so) of not playing fair in their polemics.  Anyone that opposed them
became a sort of naive, anti-intellectual dupe, falling back on benighted
notions of the unified self.  And of course, those who opposed
deconstruction most adamantly ended up falling into the trap.  My sense is
that deconstruction played itself out in American lit-crit.  This doesn't
mean Derrida is not an interesting writer in the French avant-garde
tradition.  But the grandiloquence of claims made on his behalf doesn't
really help to understand him.


A few quibbles with William James Austin:

"When Existentialism (earlier french poodle stuff
that informed Hemingway's art, to name just one)"

Hemingway (his good stuff at least) comes before Sartre, chronologically.
I don't see him as particularly influenced by French existentialism. Maybe
there's a connection I don't see here...


"I have yet to see a sensible argrument mounted against
Derrida's evaluation of the metaphysical tradition."

Not to put too fine a point on it, but "sensible arguments" are part of
the metaphysical tradition.  That Derrida is irrefutable on his own terms
does not mean that his work commands our assent, since part of this
irrefutability comes as a result of his rhetorical strategy.  If I don't
adopt the Derridean language then I don't understand Derrida (so it is
said). I have to accept his claims of "rigor," but my claims of rigor are
inherently metaphysical, etc...

It is not necessarily close-minded to reject this game in which Derrida
gets to set all the rules. One of the most enfuriating rules is the
prohibition against paraphrase.  In other words, all paraphrases of
Derrida's thought that detractors (and even defenders)  come up with are
said to be simplifications, or caricatures.  This may be true in many
cases! But part of intellectual argumentation is the ability to say "so
what you are saying is that..." etc...  You can do this profitably with
Wittgenstein but not with Heidegger or Derrida.

Isn't the lack of eloquence being talked about here (by hyper-verbal
extremely articulate people) the rhetorical simulation of a lack of
eloquence?  If someone were really inarticulate he or she would probably
desire the ability to be more eloquent. Just like dieting to lose
weight assumes the availability of a food supply.     Just another
perspective on this fruitful thread...

Tisa, Thanks for your wonderful post. I am reminded of a dear pal who has
just finished a dissertation on US/UK women's novels of the 70s, a project
begun by lugging her mom's old books out of the garage whilst in 80s high
school. So your sidewalk story actually makes me feel happy about the ways
literature moves. Also briefly, sometime next year we here at Lucy plan to
start reading for Outlet # 7 in which we are hoping to publish brief
comments by currently practicing writers on historical female authors who
inspire (or simply inform) them. I hope it will be a widely various group.
Best, Eliz.

Sorry, a synapse misfired.

Brandon Downing, Lisa Lubasch, Prageeta Sharma (and Rishi Zutshi, opening)
will be reading *this* Friday, April 28th (not the 21st).

Tell a friend and come out,
I can vouch for these poets like none other.

And we'll be over in plenty time for the Arellano/Waldrop filmfest at Fort
Thunder, even offer some rides out there...

Patrick--Yes, I think we're probably not *too* far from agreement about
what's going on in the poem.  I'm certainly not arguing for some
paraphrasable content that let's us dispose of the poem, and I like your
poet/roofer speculations quite a bit.  But for me, what I was saying
about
there being a kind of metacommentary on poetics doesn't really arouse
any feeling that the poet is ab/using his subjects.  It seems to me that
Williams observes with precision and doesn't falsify anything to make
his point.  It's as if there's a parallel subject (poetics)--or perhaps
a parallel *enactment* would be more accurate.  I think not only
Williams's stuff but poetry in general tends to do this.  Sort of like
the way Blake's Tyger's pulsing heart is also the pulsing rhythm of the
poem itself.  steve

Hi all,

Thought you might dig hearing about a great NYC band, White Collar Crime,
which has played a couple of gigs for my small press and has a new album
out, "Death to Muzak." They're fronted by Sander Hicks, who runs Soft Skull
Press, one of the best small presses out there (check SPD for titles).
Sanders' lyrics are damn solid, like these from the lead song "Printed
Matter":


=09Love is a piece of printed matter
=09anyone can say I love you=20
=09printed matter holds something that would
=09never fade
=09be acid free
=09kind and kind of like
=09the love from me =85

=09=85 But I love a third rate biography
=09of Bertrand Russell
=09More than=20
=09I love
=09you

And instead of the standard guitar, drums, bass, they swap in organ or
keyboards for the guitar, with  ex-Jeff Buckley bandmate Parker Kindred on
drums. Real solid stuff, smacked with literary references and a social(ist)
bent.

Go to www.softskull.com/wcc for mp3s, lyrics, and info. Enjoy.

as ever,
David

I was wondering if I could take a poll from those of you in hiring
positions at American colleges and universities... Could you please tell me
what the starting salaries are (in English specifically or the humanities
in general) for both contract and tenured postings at your school?

Replies b/c.

Thanks,
Carolyn

Hello!

I hope Bruce won't mind that I've absconded his email list for other =
purposes.
If you have a couple free minutes this week, please take a look at the =
media site I'm helping manage these days -- www.mediachannel.org.

Along with a lot of interesting media criticism, and audio and video =
features, you might like Robert Atkins report "Examining the Interface" =
on our homepage. I mention this feature as he announces different =
artsites you might find enjoyable. But also, because I'm trying to =
develop ideas for getting experimental writing and more on this site -- =
please email me with any notions once you've had a look around (check =
out the Affiliated Sites directory--SPD has joined!) -- thanks!

All best,
Andrew Levy

"I've got a reason for running. I talk about a larger goal, which is to
call upon the best of America. It's part of the renewal. It's reform and
renewal. Part of the renewal is a set of high standards and to remind
people that the greatness of America really does depend on neighbors
helping neighbors and children finding mentors. I worry. I'm very worried
about, you know, the kid who just wonders whether America is meant for
him. I really worry about that. And uh, so, I'm running for a reason. I'm
answering this question here and the answer is, you cannot lead America to
a positive tomorrow with revenge on one's mind. Revenge is so incredibly
negative. And so to answer your question, I'm going to win because people
sense my heart, know my sense of optimism and know where I want to lead
the country. And I tease people by saying, 'A leader, you can't say,
follow me the world is going to be worse.' I'm an optimistic person. I'm
an inherently content person. I've got a great sense of where I want to
lead and I'm comfortable with why I'm running. And, you know, the call on
that speech was, beware. This is going to be a tough campaign."

On Friday evening, May 5, POG will hold its annual benefit dinner (a serious
feast).  If you'd like to attend, please either print out the invitation at
the bottom of this email and return it along with your check to the address
indicated; or (preferable, since time is short) send me an email reply
indicating how many will be in your party and the dinner choices for each
diner (you can separately mail your check to the address listed on the
invitation).

POG needs significant profits from the dinner in order to balance our
1999-2000 budget; so we hope you'll seriously consider attending.  It should
be a great evening, and your contribution will definitely help POG continue
making its unique contribution to the Tucson poetry and arts scene.

In that vein: donations (by non-diners) are also very much needed and
appreciated, and can likewise be mailed to POG member (and chef) Kali Tal at
the address on the invitation flier.

thanks!

Hi John-- edit as you see fit--

       I hope my words will do justice to aptly depict  the most remarkable
memorial service which I attended tonight in honor of Doug Oliver.At the
British Institute, a reference library room overflowing with well over 100
people met together at 7:30 pm for a two hour tribute. Opened by Professor
Christophe Campos reading the words of Yeats the entire evening was
inspirational. We should all be so lucky to lead lives as loving and full as
Douglas Oliver. His wife Alice Notley shared a tale about the hospital nurse
asking what religion they were and did Doug need to speak to a minister--NO-
she said- we are poets.. he is agnostic..Later she realized that this did not
do justice at all to Doug's spirituality and read an excerpt from Whisper
Louise which Doug wrote  during his illness.
   His brother Brian spoke as did all of his children,Kate Oliver and Bonamy
Oliver-Johns, from his first,happy 20 year marriage to Jan Oliver .Also, his
sons,Anselm and Edmund Berrigan , from his second happy marriage to Alice
Notley, filled the room with "Well of Sorrows" and bluesy gospel recordings
that Doug loved.
     Many colleagues and friends and students from England, France and the
United States, spoke about his kindness and care as a friend, as a  man and
as a  teacher. The man with a 'great outer gentleness and inner warpaint' who
reminded us of 'the humbling necessity of poetry' and insisted on the
'existence of spirit in language' greatly impacted all those who knew him
very well or even briefly.
         Remembered by his colleagues at the British Institute for his
passion in reinvigorating the Institute and founding the Tuesday Club . A
memorable conversation which usually began in a haze of cigar smoke in the
staff lounge and  continued for as long as two weeks, ending up in 'Le
Debutante' around the corner .
          As his friend and colleague Mark Sholl, wondered what he would have
said about his own memorial had he been able to attend, the firery energy
that filled this man's life filled the room .
           I left feeling inspired to do much more with my life than I have
done so far.....

and I've never understood why the fact that someone is in or out of fashion
would be a reason for me to either pay attention or not pay attention --

WHATEVER any might think of Derrida and his public reception, I'd strongly
recommend his book of about a year ago (or anyway, a year ago in English)
_Monolingualism of the Other_ -- I used it in a seminar on the ethics of
reading, but I think anyone interested in the politics of language (which
wd be most poets?) would find this small book of large interest --

another good recent read was Lacoue-Labarthe's _Poetry as Experience_,
which reads Celan -- I have no idea if Lacoue-Labarthe is in or out --
