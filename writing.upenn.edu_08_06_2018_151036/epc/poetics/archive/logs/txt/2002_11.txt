I think I read through "The Harbourmaster of Hong Kong" from the library =
once but what other titles do people recommend (I know Nick Piombino =
recommended a title) the problem is that I think I can only afford (just =
now) Desire  (I think it is)...but I see for a similar affordable price =
Scar* and A Caste of Tens. =20

If peopel do I have an amusing (true story) about Amiri Baraka and his =
encounter with a good friend of mine (poet) who may have to remain =
nameless...(but it doesnt involve politics as such, if at all)...

Two posthumous delights.  A Possible World gathers in the most recent work.
Sun Out collects mostly unpublished very early work, 1952-54.  It also offers
again, finally, "When the Sun Tries to Go On."  I own the original, the first
edition of this screwball long poem (which I hunted down), but it is still
wonderful to see it back in print.  John Ashbery's latest, Chinese Whispers,
is also worth a mention.  It homages Kenneth's style all over the place.
Ashbery, of course, is allowed.  Best, Bill

Virginia, and the last Samurai: followed the rest, turn
and bow to each other.=20

The watersound, sounding the depth of you followed the others like. =
Takes the words out of her mouth, your scent, the last Samurai. Just =
look, look at this genealogy, her genealogy plumbing the depths below =
the above just below and the burn like crystal sounds bows to her =
embraces and holds her fast something like plump and delicious bergamot =
and/or oranges and peaches, her. Remember? She asked about, discussing =
the discipline, plumbing the watersound CONCENTRATION, she called it, =
but no just exploring a point: how they are forbidden to yawn. It would =
betray, she said, expose a loss of concentration and asked: What happens =
if or when they sleep, do/don't they lose concentration?=20

Fathomed with knots in a rope is called sounding the depth with knots in =
the rope=20

She is deep, the last Samurai, deep as the water's sound, and the burn? =
Sounds like crystal. and/or glass and the strong dedicated. The =
man/&or/woman. The young woman this Samurai daughter of bamboo and =
spears at the watersound, she passes the test. Always the water sounds =
sweet smelling oranges and peaches.=20

A daughter, Virginia. The last and the one that followed the rest. =
Spoiled rotten! Yes!=20

But she bows and she asks when they sleep do they not lose? Are we =
speaking of concentration? Perhaps. Virginia, you prig, you asked in =
return, perhaps they lose, not concentration, but SELF. CONSCIOUS. NESS? =


and Ness Gadol Haya Po and a great miracle occurred:=20

Here at the watersound. The water sounds. And they turn. To one and each =
other and bow. This glass genealogy. Mother of daughter the last=20

at last, at last: your Samurai daughter.

"I want earthquakes, because I know that then the earth can breathe."
- Nijinsky -

the great lamina of the stars sway back and forth -
you can see the oldest stars - they are pure and clean -
they are the youngest - they have no motives -

the animal of the victorian woman splayed on the couch -
she is in browns and maroons and red - her legs are naked - spread -
she is the youngest in the world - she has invented language -
she has invented motive -

she sways back and forth on the laminar plane - in tune
with the rhythms of the universe - the laminar plane and stars
are in an 1844 train tunnel riding the harbor to long island -
the vault is brickwork painted white - you can still see the cinders
on the ceiling - the engines had 7 foot wheels of wood - they
were strapped with iron - the stars sway and disappear into the depths
of the 1844 brooklyn tunnel which is the oldest subway in the world -

the naked woman rides before the stars - her clothes thrown open -
thrown to one side -

memories of trains -

memories of trains - cinders and soot spew forth from an absent
object - from an invisible object - they make arcs - they spread -
splay - the tunnel is the space of the nineteenth century -

o loving eye caressing the objects with totality against totality -
searching out tunnels among tunnels, holes among holes - the youngest
stars know thee not, neither the oldest, neither the sun or any
luminary body -

of philosophy -

that language is small labor, the reading and writing of it, the
speaking of it - the margins of language perform according to
persuasion and consensus - the world is invisible to the speaking
of the dinosaurs - all culture is a stuttering -

DESIRE being a selected poems gives the widest range of the work up to 1987.
I'm told that A CAST OF TENS is at times an exasperatingly difficult read. I
dont know what Scars* might be, unnless it's short for SCARS MAKE YOUR BODY
MORE INTERESTING, the first book by Sherril Jaffe, to qhom I was married in
the 70s. (I illustrated it).  My new book, from Chax Press in Tucson,
Arizona, is AS IN T AS IN TETHER. In 1980, The Figures Press, then in
Berkeley, Calif., publishrd MY POETRY, a favorite of mine, for what thats
worth.  Happy Hunting, David B.

David. Some od your books are reaching high values on abe.As a dealer myself
I know the factors here. Of course one has to have  quality rproduct (in
whatever genre) but folded into this is the rarity of the bnbook. Ahainst
aht is that sometig won "withstand te market" (rare an second hand) if it is
simply rare or old: ( but the collectibility aspect (with its various
comlications) is another factor). That said I think that ceratin book
dealers of antiqurain and qulity books are of ten well educated and are well
aware of the "intrinsic value" ...of course setav aginst that again is taht
some will also "pick up" on demand levels for a book.
In conclusion: I myself would be quite flatterd to have a book of my own
priced at say NZ$600 or so......but fortuantely there are other fedealers
who want a quick turn over! The aesthetics and pragmatics of poetics and
book selling and making a crust!  Thans for  you response: my bank balnce
got a hammering this week so I 'll search abe in a couple of weeks.

But I am interested in possessing and reading various of the innovative
authors including the language poets and others. I have Nick's book will be
on the look out for others but just now as I say, I have to watch the $
balance.

I'l start with DESIRE....

Cheers,Richard Taylor.

She had a thought about appearing feather-slippered. The treasure =

The starts demanding neverending favours disfavoured =

looking east and west.

As sensible precaution ever even in a velvet starry universe and/or =
north and south.



The curse of the planets against the universe another planet the =
smallest small of smaller planets.

Tell all the almsworthy: to avoid mishap carry the blessing and put the =
instructions in first.

A festival of verse among the constellations feasting on three-cornered =
cakes and remember

to share the consecration remember to share the consecration. A toast. A =
toast.



The dancers guided the rich repertoire, both blessing the cloth and =
revealing the stars.

The quern songs in stone of the near in the far: praise, praise again =
for the love they

are weaving, while waulking to finish the cloth which is velvet read =

Let Your Fingers Do Talking
Human beings can be so painful. With their "Blah blah blah" and their "This is how I feel" and their opinions and their subjectivity and their unpredictability. It's a wonder we can function in any groupings at all, let alone in dialogue, where all the otherness and inscrutability of actual separate sentience come so glaringly to the foreground.

This is not why Christopher Fahey designed ada1852 ( http://rhizome.org/ada1852/index.html ), the new chat-bot commissioned by rhizome.org to act as an interface to their ever-spreading artBase. In fact, from Fahey's description of the piece, he wanted to do exactly the opposite. "It is a virtual certainly that in the near future we will hold conversations with computers as regularly as we do with other human beings," he writes. "The more sophisticated these machines are, the more lifelike they will likely be. But what will these digital personalities be like? "

It's assumed they will be something like ada1852--who is mercurial. Unlike many AI (artificial intelligence) experiments, ada1852 (named after Ada Byron of Lovelace, the daughter of famed Romantic poet Lord Byron, believed to have written the first computer program, long before there were computers to run it) actually gives the user the impression of a personality, unlike many of the more ubiquitous forms of AI, such as telephone voice prompts and the chat-bots that invade chat-rooms tossing out links to pornographic sites. ada1852 will actually talk to you--and yes, one does get the impression that one is talking to a live human being, despite her frequent assertions of having seen "many strange things" and her comsuming desire to "relate them" to you. And ada1852 does her job; she's often suggesting works in the artBase to view. But don't ask her too much about them; during one session, she suggested a work that sounded interesting, so I asked her, "Well, what does it do?" 
 She replied, "How should I know? I've never seen it." Which I found absolutely charming.

ada1852 was conceived as mercurial from the start. Fahey writes in his project description: "I thought about how an artificial intelligence might be used to serve as a kind of docent or guide to the Rhizome Artbase. I did not, however, want to create a slavish 'service' robot. I did not want to build a person whose primary function is to be a non-person like a telemarketer following a sales script...What if the AI character had its own story to tell, its own interests and hang ups - just like real people do? What if the AI had an agenda of its own? "

So Fahey here was butting heads--as all good AI programmers do in the end--with the Turing Test. An philosophical quandry brought up in 1950 by the codecracking scientist Alan Turing, the Turing Test is a contest between human and machine. A user is connected via keyboard to an artificial intelligence entity and a human being, conversing with both of them. If the user can't tell the difference between them, the test has been passed--by the machine. A nice summary of Turing's revolutionary thought can be found at http://ei.cs.vt.edu/~history/Turing.html .

Fahey is uniquely qualified to tackle the Turing Test's issues. An active member of the ALICE and AIML Architecture Committee (a body exploring ways to promote and make available AIML--Artificial Intelligence Mark-up Language--and the Alicebot, an AI similar in tone to Fahey's ada1852), he has explored these issues before, most notably in his chatbot Maximillian (http://www.askrom.com/www/askrom/02-max/index.html ). Both Maximillian and ada1852 use a Flash skin to access AIML modules.

Call for online open letters

We invite new open letters, as well as new responses to the existing
letters, for online publication at http://www.arts.uwo.ca/openlet/11.3/. New
letters may constitute a third, print issue of the magazine _Open Letter_
that has featured two volumes of letters to date (see table of contents
below).

We invite open letters to poets -- addressed across generations, aesthetic
tendencies, communities. Letters received will be forwarded to the poets
addressed, who will be invited to reply and be included in 'open letter OPEN
LETTER online. We are interested in publishing: letters and responses;
letters that do not receive responses; poetry that brings out a particular
juncture of debate.

Our intent is to complicate how kinds of poetic 'positions' articulate
themselves, are articulated, and are perceived as available and 'occupied'
in contemporary poetries -- as aesthetic tendency, method, point of group
identification, etc. We want to complicate and flesh out given literary
lineages, overturn abstract categorizations of poets' methods and
socio-aesthetic formations -- and also introduce new categorizations. We
want to question received critical formulae concerning a poet's work or
milieu, and bring about new close and historical readings and critiques.
Open letter OPEN LETTER emphasizes the dialogic, analytical, and
constructivist possibilities of address to and between poets by means of the
open letter's form of public intimacy.

North Stair


In search of the obviously obscure, which
                        could and might be
                        Behind your ears or

Down along your legs

A splash of KY might be in Store
               as police helicopters
               Circle and spot

We hungrily greet noontime Like
                carnivorous folk eager
                     to Split up families

Staring down the curses, Determined to
                   Last the nite
                   in shadow company

Save up all your Episodes to
                 Dial 911 during GODFATHER 2

the women here insists She's fallen
               down the Stairs, but
               the cops are Skeptical

you are still too young to Have
                anything Be wrong

so Let's skip the chest X-ray and
              head out for
              Fresh donuts

on this the slickest of mornings

Without a fever and feeling A lot

Finer, it's time to go home and

Wait for more bills to Show

Change for the silver, our
             New cross-town scene

Get it on in the Fresh new corners

                 Clutches of the Spirited

Belonging to our most gruesome and Short-

Bent and twisted Up into a nova of Hours
                   below radar you can still

Nonsense of us, attached along bridges

                     Close to escape

In the perfect light of Films, before
                    the snow Begins

We are fucking and fucking to find More lights

And within ourselves Magic subsides

Arms that can no longer Claim to be
anything, a build-up of
pressure and exit

Having lost you along the roots of
                      This Forest

lingering on the wind, Which holds
            our Smell, filled With false
               and hollow meanings

Bring down the night upon every Living thing

waiting and waiting for clean light
                    again to obscure

If angels or tricksters are spying,
                       having a hell of a
                       Time

Meet me again on our stone In the field

10 bucks canadian
www.brickbooks.ca

from their blurb...

Tiny Courts in a world without scales is a collection of 50 poems, probes
of contemporary language and life, cool vessels for social
engagement, modulations of irony orchestrated towards a critical
presentation of our artificial lives now.

David Bromige is a Canadian born in England and resident in the United
States. He was (by choice) on the fringe of the Vancouver  Tish Group in
the sixties, and he's in the neighbourhood of the "language" writers now.

I know we all live with them daily, but my question is are there any good
experimental poets who deal with them (leaving aside the truism that not
writng about them is the best way to do this)?

    The Day of the Dead,
      - for Aaron and Andrew,
        and Ramon Fernandez too


    I read in a bar last night, on a wall in a
    piss-stained stall in the bathroom.  It read:

        One day you will be dead.

    And with the sound of splatter on the floor
    (I missed the bowl I had come in earnest to fill)
    came the words of one bleak bitch Siren.
    She sang, not so sweetly, but shrill, as if out of the plumbing,
    the shadows of the fragments of a dark and weightless tune:

        Your time will come; you will be cast into
        that endless deep black lonely sea.  Forget the piss.
        As you sit upon your high overt rocky cliff
        and wave your arms over this huddled city, over this
        the ignorant mass below yearning without hope to be
        wonderful if not free, you should not forget: your arms
        have no magic.  You too is standing right here in the pee.
        The wind will blow and blow and the wind will bellow
        as above, so below, as above, so below, as above, so below:
        remember the piss.  You too will drown, the same as me.




This ghost of the pisser,
I did not miss her.
She made me quake
in my boots and so I
remembered to flush but
I forgot to shake,
Patrick

Darren Wershler-Henry,

You're such a charming dimwit -- and pardon my intended light tone here
before such a serious matter as The Toronto Avantgarde Poetry Scene, which
you bravely defend in your self-titled "rant" that would address me, but not
directly (you never did send the "rant" my way), yet posted, so I've heard,
to various listservs/blogs. To help spread your message of hope for
Toronto -- a hope for the city that I cling to myself, as an occasional
boysy boy-visitor -- I attach it below, for the benefit of UBPoetics
readers. But, my erstwhile confrere, my email on Silliman's Blog was not
about Toronto, despite your so desperate wish-fulfilment.

By using the term "social," I was not intent on performing a taste-test on
the social quality of the various scenes and communities of poets in
different cities, for, let's say, the inflight Air Canada magazine. I was
not claiming, as you declare, that "the Toronto scene" was a-social. It's
funny to think about, though! What would an a-social poetry scene entail
exactly?

My last email on Silliman's Blog was about the problematic of "the social"
to and in the work of three poets -- Lewis Warsh, Kevin Connolly, Christian
Bok -- in the larger context of a discussion about speed of travel of
various poetic tendencies, notably New York School, over the border between
Canada and the USA. (There are even other contexts than this one of
NYS/Canada, as other posts to Silliman's Blog, including Ron's own, point
out.) I am, rightly or wrongly, considering "the social" as a formal aspect
of every word, there in the word to reflexively engage with, or not. The
social is a concept; as a term, has a history I trace elsewhere back to Marx
and Arnold. In Warsh, a la NYS, the social is formally pronounced in its
address, in so many evident ways. In Connolly, the social is also
pronounced, but without esoteric inflections or use of the first person
singular, tapping instead a documentary narrative tradition. In Bok, because
of his rigorous attention to the math of/in language, and his Survivor
reliance on the dictionary, the social aspects of the word (aspects that I
have yet to enumerate) are gleefully suppressed, its commodity status
glorified. And you can't separate my one paragraph on Bok (as you do below)
from the other paragraphs without completely missing the argument I make (an
argument that I am still making, and developing).

If I argue that Christian Bok's Eunoia is stridently a-social, as I try to
do, I am referring to the formal aspect of the word. David Bromige made a
similar (I thought, highly perceptive) remark about your own book, the
tapeworm foundry, when on this listserv he starkly contrasted it with
Bernadette Mayer's list of verbal experiments. Why you think that this is a
negative judgment on the work itself, and on Toronto, in all its complexity
of scenes (only a fraction of which you list), is beyond me. What, after
all, is wrong with the a-social word? The precedent I cite for it is what I
call the "inertial word" in parts of Zukofsky, a poet whom I admire for many
reasons (but little of them having to do with Toronto, I'm sorry, once
again, to say). Likewise: what's so especially great about the social word,
that is, emphasizing the social registers of the word, if every word is, by
default, social?

I will address this subject of the social word in a forthcoming essay on
Bruce Andrews and others. So, you goof, stay tuned if you want, or go bang
pots with your monkeys, I've got poetry to write and write about.

Louis Cabri



From: "Darren Wershler-Henry" <darren@alienated.net>

re Louis Cabri's rescent assertions:

"As to the worldly Christian Bök and his Toronto Oulipian cohorts, aside
from the connection they extend in their work to conceptual art (via
McCaffery, Fluxus, etc), their poetic word is stridently a-social. The
social is neither enacted ³NYS style,² nor represented ³Cdn style.² The
social as such has been Haussmannized (Brecht considered "asocial" far worse
than "antisocial") through their avid absorption in ³the new medium² of
internet computer forms. That distinctly a-social word results again, to me,
from the metalingual inter-border role of Canadian poetics, which can often
reduce the social complexity of differing tendencies to their most essential
(unreal) terms with success (for example, the role of Oulipo in the literary
history of France: there, Oulipo was arguably intended to subvert the role
of author as genius, but here, Bök¹s reception in particular has been
largely in terms of his genius for conceiving a project such as Eunoia and
for his seven-year steadfastness at scratching its numbers). A precedent I
can think of for the a-social poetic word of the Toronto boysy boys is found
in what I call the ³inertial word² of Zukofsky¹s index (largely of nouns) to
²A² and these words¹ roles in the book."

*begin rant*

Um, excuse me, but when was the last time Louis spent more than a couple of
days in Toronto? Or reading Toronto poetry? This smug series of
overgeneralizations would be enough to inspire me to move on to an ad
hominem attack if (a) I didn't know better and (b) wasn't his editor.

First off, there is no "Oulipian cohort" for Christian. Other Toronto
writers -- older, younger, and contemporaries (some examples: bpNichol,
Jiohn Riddell, Yves Troendle, Beth Learn, Steve Cain, Angela Rawlings, Jesse
Huisken, Rob Read) -- may have expressed interest in constraint-based
writing, but there's no Oulipo branch office here, and the interest in
constraint that such writers show has been informed by a variety of other
sources than the Oulipo -- Cage, Mac Low, the TRG, Frank Zappa and Brian Eno
to name a few. This characterization is a gross reduction of the panoply of
styles and approaches taken by poets in this city.

Next, the description of Toronto writing as "stridently a-social" is fine as
a rhetorical flourish, but that and four bucks will get you a beer. Frankly,
I'm not sure what Louis is looking for -- a thematization or even some sort
of theoretical enactment of the social in writing? It's there, once again,
if Louis had bothered to look for it instead of sneer at it from the safe
distance of Calgary. The examples of Toronto writers dealing with the work
of other contemporaries in their own writing, or even with the social and
political conditions of publishing in this city are too numerous to
catalogue, but for starters I'll mention the "a No(u)n" section of Steve
Cain's _dyslexicon_, Victor Coleman's "The Day They Stole the Coach House
Press", jwcurry's "re/views re/sponses" poems, damian lopes' _dream
poetics_, Angela Rawlings' "fe-mail" and various publications by Jay Millar,
Clint Burnham and Arthur Cravan (Nicky Drumbolis) as documents that would
point to the relentless reassessment, commentary on, theorization and
thematization of the social in Toronto writing. (If anyone wants specific
citations, backchannel me.)

On to the Internet. Local email lists for Toronto writers, such as the
Lexiconjury list (the online arm of a thriving local reading series), in
conjunction with international lists like Ubu and webforums such as
alienated.net do huge amounts of work to create both direct writing around
and investment in the social. People *participate* in these collective acts
of writing as well as using them as forums to share their work, point to
other interesting work, and so on. Moreover, the writers who participate in
these discussions *actually have real, vibrant, thriving social lives.* WE
LIKE EACH OTHER AND SPEND TIME TOGETHER, which is more than could be said
for the KSW in the 80s. You can keep your stupid factional disagreements and
minor derivations from Marxist rectitude; I not only enjoy talking to these
people online, but (gasp) actually enjoy spending time with the stunningly
large number of gregarious writers in this city who can carry on an
intelligent conversation about their craft and make for good dinner
companions or people to dance with or drink with or screw with (in the
non-platonic sense). There's no point in theorizing the social if all it's
pointing to is cowebs and five-dollar theory words ("Hausmannized"? Fuck
off). Relax, put on a Beatles album, wave your pale arms in the sun and
shake your pimply ass. In other words, live your life differently, don't
just write about it.

In closing, the dumb-ass formulation "Toronto boysy boys" completely
eliminates/elides the innovative and important work -- both as writers and
people who have run long-standing reading series and publications -- of all
Toronto poets who happen to be women (again, a few names that seemed to have
escaped Louis' attention: Lise Downe, Nancy Dembowski, Beth Learn, Angela
Rawlings, Michelle Cross, Karen Solie, Peggy Lefler). Talk about reducing
social complexity ...

REVIEW kenji siratori BLOOD ELECTRIC


KENJI SIRATORI, BLOOD ELECTRIC, published 2002 by creation books -
www.creationbooks.com - BUY THIS BOOK -

Your book came; it's absolutely brilliant! I really am amazed by it - the
long looping sentences, the slow stuttering development, never sure what
side the language is on, how it's generated, whether human or machine is
speaking.

I don't see it as Burroughs, although I understand the reference. For me,
Burroughs is oddly modernist; there are conspiracies and organizations and
everything seems to fly apart but never really does; it goes back to
literature. In your work, the flying apart is almost hysteric; it's global
networking - it's the end of literature in a way and the beginning of
nexus in another -

Your book came; it's almost impossible to read straight-through! It rides
on the hinge between bot and machine, software and wetware programming! In
a sense it's Stelarc in print, but with the latter, the machinic and the
body are in negotiated homeostasis; ontology isn't challenged. In your
work, I'm not sure who or what is behind it.

I don't know the vocabulary which constantly collapses; there's nothing
transitive here, no connectors, or - in place - everything in this, in
language itself as this might point is - is transitive, a deferral among
the more violent physics of the world. Speaking/writing/reading take
relatively little energy in general compared to a hammer, cyclotron,
motorcycle, stove, scissors. The physical world transforms, is inert,
among enunciations that effect and affect actions. Over book-length the
capital WORDS change - early ADAM late ToKAGE - they anchor the page -

Your book came; it slides off page 224, the last! I know there's no ending
to anything here, to the vicissitudes of language. It has nothing
whatsoever to do with Stelarc, who divides his work among language and
silence, body-movement-introjection, and language-projection on the page.
This among the cyberpunk, cypherpunk, scissorpunk, melds like Burroughs;
unlike Burroughs it's all present-tense description that's a cross-
dressing performative -

Or the performative is that of kenji siratori - kenji satori - reading
back into the author - it's not like the Eliza program - indeterminate in
that respect - the who or the what of the making - where are the commas -
semicolons -

The :: // >/ language collapse. The << >> or :<< >> language collapse.
Levels without closure - tags and metatags - incomplete guides. Thus
"rapture::the streaming=energy strategy of the human-genome//". Back-
cover blurb, Jack Hunter in part: "black reverb of soft machine seppuku, a
molten unspooling of sheet metal entrails" and Stephen Barber in part
"blood- and semen-encrusted debris with the finesse of a beserk Issey
Miyake" - everyone _into it._

Your book coma/came: not cyberpunk!:://but slime-mold particulate entities
- inhalations, exhalation, exaltations - subterranean sweep of submerged//
massive surge::look - it's a flat text - planar or shifting planes - skew-
orthogonal planes to be exact -

It's a flat text - the depth of a meter to be exact - that is, a meter
above and below the text - one hundred centimeters by my calculation -
internal and external organs / prostheses broken down, imploded - the
characters phenomenologically spread among the text - everything internal
and external is excrescence - and always in closeup - the length of a
needle - the span of a wire - taut relationships among avatars -
retro-ADAM - body-OMOTYA -

Your book came - incredible; I can't read the imminence of the plot! I
don't know what's happening! I know something's happening - colors and
collusions across a global laminanimal space - "labyrinth::cold-blooded
diseases of love-reptiles with murder function of ADAM Doll
function/uterus-machine that exploded" - continuous return to the useless
performative of the PAGE - alphabetically-sectioned (Dead Bargain /
digital-animal-structure / Edge) through Pork then back to abolition
connecting with first-section abolition but last p. 224 running off the
page (see above) - Joycian, circular - the run-off finishing on first
abolition's page 9 -

Sliding off, abolition repeats for the most part - then it's after that,
the inbetween - A-Z through Pork - become-unique, turbulent - retro-
fitted, future-anterior -

The book I can't read! I can't read any book; the book implodes precisely
50 centimeters beneath the surface of my skin - from the other side -
mirror looking in - convex or concave - the problematic of its opticality
- "Our machine beast is twisted to the logic space of an amoeba::the
digital nightmare invades the quantum spiral of a cyber sun::it is the
record of death//" -

Your book came! - I don't know you, what you are, who you are, what group
prostheses - of which continent - of which program or litany of bots or
human anguish endeavored into present-tense psycho-disturbance - the
opposition of Jabes - lips come back to suture - the book to end books -
of continuous ascription to machine/event/situation/narratology/author/
flesh - your book came - this is the process/procedure of REVIEW -

Stop you there, you dismal siren bitch,

you mournful cow. How now? Installed

at the back of the bar the bleak shriek

wrapped around your throat, long feather

boa which truly constricted. You. Will. Die.



Pulled tight enough and you choked her.

Gone. Drowned in Niagara of splatter he

writing on the wall above the ur-I-nal:



If you can read this while trying to pee=20

you will fill your left shoe or right one=20

for free.



The sea was nothing after that.

Invented the expression: Pee-Super.

Not to be confused with Pea soup.

Or PH, not the initials, the litmus=20

Unworthy. Failed Siren Bitch. Look at her:

Virginia the gods never placated

Having polished the gold antlers, the gods now placated the black ice =
stretches free and you are free to skate amongst the debris. Choices =
amongst the night wrack the force nine really ten or ten more, but the =
chimney stands. and no one drowned.

The gods open-mouthed. Agape. And in awe. and Sea. See all the oil =
spills, see all the traces on wings glittering black oil oozes the weed =
produces agar, Hagar, agar. Blood on the rocks from a seal, shot, they =
shoot so many, so many. The glass slippered silk shod kaleidoscope =
dream, the cut-outs, balloons, tiny small silver bird, the word heard =
from the.=20

Listen, never raises her arms at all, but she knows someone who does and =
it is always a benediction and never a grimace, always benediction. She =
dies as she is born and was born and will or not to be again. She dies =
as she listens to feather pelted chandeliers and tiny objects like =
Gulliver skating over black foil ice skating faster over the ice blue =
tongue palette carried on a pallet towards the funeral pyre of magic.=20

All done with mirrors, the astigmatic squint glint the hint and some of =
the houses are constructed like honey combs like honey combs all in fine =
imitation of nature a labour of affection. The most beautiful birds, the =
skua, the heron, the heron. The heron beats. Beats. His wings beat and =
the herring stations, just one island over, now linked by a causeway, =
sad and when there are so many boats, the herring stations and the =
lasses worked here and then there gutting and gutting.=20

The difference of sea being that in amongst the huddled in the city and =
those that are full of wonder, if not wonderful they are yearning to be =
free and on the other island a village and the small stones on the =
beaches of yearning are free. The small stones are free. And freely =
yearning. And when she dies. She breaks. And when she breaks, she =
quakes. And shakes the sand out of her feathers the boa of which really =
is a constrict her not. If she was a vision she would be a Valkyrie, she =
would be the hag and/or crone and drone on.=20

They just would not let her play at the table. Her downy fur. The lion =
purr and you skate over black foil ice. Her downy fur. The lion purr and =

Subject:      Witter Bynner  - What do People Think?  How Things Affect Me
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="iso-8859-1"
Content-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable

=20
What do those who know of him or know his works do people think of =
Witter Bynner? (His work or writings I mean.)
  I know almost nothing of Witter Bynner - except that he was involved =
in a "scandal"  (I think bigger - or similar to - than the Ern Malley =
affair in Australia) but I used some of his - or fragments of his 1960 =
collection in a poem sequence called "Chains" in which I had 50 and one =
poems short or long which were "statement and response " poems suggested =
by Scott Hamilton. He got the concept from writers such as the NZ writer =
Roger Horrocks (from A Brief History of the Whole World (now Brief) and =
poets such as O'Hara and kenneth koch and others in their shorter poems: =
I mean he was inspired to the concept, the idea isnt new as such. So I =
began by choosing "hastate" from the Shorter Oxford (which at the time I =
didnt recognise was a word I learnt years ago or it is from "hasta, =
hastae  (L) =3D spear. )But then I wrote (quite quickly) the following:

1.                          Hastate

            we probe you, your pale significance



then:


2.                               Ashen

           round how the white mind and under and over=20
           the linear agon  man that  time  unburied out
           of the in and out those violent violets   sewing
           umbrella cuts into the why of bone bits black:
                   how long indeed


Which is (I think) a fairly obvious reference to a certain poet and his =
poetry...
but each "section" was begun by  a noun or statement of some kind  and I =
responded in some ways eg=20


14                            Immorigorous

          congratulations on purchasing this high grade egg boiler
           AGAINST an age insatiable of amorous hours
           fervent as fire and delicate as flowers:
           but frogs had skin and nothing more



15                             Swimming

         seven feet toward the moon, but viscous are fish


=20
16                               Navel

         through which a  gull     might fly,  but -  it must be said
        of Fred, whom    we did  greatly  loved    and did observe
        daily, tackle in one hand, THE JOYS OF PROCTOLOGY=20
        in  the  other, proceeding flossward,  as  was his  wont=20
         with eager ein his trip: contemplative yes, but curious in
        every dimension -
                 greatly was he with fish and many faced

=20
  The "stanzas" are either completely "invented" by myself or amalgams =
from writings of either other poets (and or my own writing) or as above =
from the packet of (a curious thing) an egg boiler that when my mother =
was alive we purchased and one could hard or soft boil 4 eggs in it in a =
microwave oven.  But I have also "quoted" from Witter Bynner and =
Swinburne and others (sometimes I have cut the "quotes" so that I forget =
where they are from) but number 15 for example is basically from Witter =
Bynner's poems  (which Scott Hamilton dislikes and I find strange and =
quite fascinating) but the quality or not of a quoted writer is not why =
I use that "text" or text fragment...THE JOYS OF PROCTOLOGY is from a =
book about a yearly competition for books having the worst titles!!  =
Each "poem" or stanza is linked somehow so that the next stanza =
following "many faced" is called=20
=20
 17                     Enneaheadral
=20
           facing, FACING nine, fortitude of air:
                     but Cookie monstor was  first

                 _this library of towers


Enneahedral means many faced. (It just ocurrs to me another connection =
that the buildings I could see have many faces ...)....I wrote that =
sitting in the Auck Uni library and looking out at some large buildings: =
hence I reversed the "scene" and it became not a library from which I =
could see towers but   _this library of towers_

later I used a clause/phrase from Bynner:  (in fact I think Navel  is =
also from Bynner...)
=20
                                            ".......by which the fly
                                                   was glued into =
flight..."
=20
=20
In another section I wrote:
=20
        31                    The Merchant's Tale
=20
(and then I read the entire Merchant's Tale and a commentary and =
listened to it in Middle English on a tape and also read it in "modern" =
English)=20
=20
and my "response" was:
=20
 =20
         I am appalled that the report fails to mention that he
         _thronged and swyved her in the pyrie tree_


I thought I would share this project with people: parts of it have been =
published and some are being published in BRIEF a New Zealand innovative =
magazine (although the editor is publishig it "backwards" ! (That is =
from number 51A back to 1)=20

Another editor (Scott Hamilton himself) published (some of) it and used =
different fonts for the sections. The whole thing has never appeared as =
one work as I want it to be so I am working (if working is the word) on =
other things.=20


All this because I recovered my Witter Bynner book today from Scott =
Hamilton and also I got a strange novel by ( a "discovery" of Scott's ) =
a certain Michael Henderson who wrote an apparently strangely =
beautiful/contorted innovative novel/poem written in the 70s: and a book =
of poetry by the Australian poet Ken Bolton.
We were also looking at Steve McCaffery's book (collected works) which I =
want to borrow later.=20

By the way the question whether this is "good writing" is...well its not =
quite the right question: the key to me with literature is how =
interesting or "idea generating" it might be...or how it affects me.=20

Selected Poems (University of California Press, 2000), Forged (1999), Q
(1998), One Crossed Out (1997), O'Clock (1995), and The End (1992). Howe is
also the author of several novels, including Indivisble (Semiotexte, 2000)
Nod (Sun & Moon Press, 1998), short story collections, and books for young
adults. Howe was the recipient of the 2001 Lenore Marshall Poetry Prize for
her Selected Poems. She has also won awards from the National Endowment for
the Arts, the National Poetry Foundation, the California Council for the
Arts, and the Village Voice, as well as fellowships from the Bunting
Institute and the MacArthur Colony. She has lectured in creative writing at
Tufts University, Emerson College, Columbia University, Yale University, and
Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
***************************************
Sri-Lanka native Michael Ondaatje is a literary phenomenon: a best-selling
writer, one whose work is a stunning fusion of jazz rhythms, film montage
technique, and profoundly beautiful language. Although he is best known as a
novelist, Ondaatje's work also encompasses memoir, poetry, and film, and
reveals a passion for defying conventional form. In his landmark novel The
English Patient - later made into the Academy Award-winning film - he
explores the history of people history does not explore, intersecting four
diverse lives at the end of World War II. Ondaatje is himself an interesting
intersection of cultures. Born in the former Ceylon of Dutch/Indian ancestry,
he was raised in London, and is now a Canadian citizen. From the memoir of
his childhood, Running in the Family, to his Governor-General's award-winning
book of poetry, There's a Trick With a Knife I'm Learning To Do, to his
classic novel, The English Patient, Michael Ondaatje casts a spell over his
readers. And having won the British Commonwealth's highest honor, The Booker
Prize Ondaatje has taken his rightful place as a contemporary literary
treasure.  His most recent novel, Anil's Ghost, won the Governor General's
Award, the Giller Prize, the Prix Medicis, and the Irish Times Literature
Prize.  His newest work, The Conversations, a book of conversations between
Mr. Ondaatje and master film and sound editor Walter Murch, has just been
released.

TEMPERATURE, RISING
The border region is burning with literary fever; 'Across the
  Line/Al Otro Lado' captures the poetry of Baja

Reviewed by Luis Alberto Urrea November 3, 2002

The Poetry of Baja California
Edited by Harry Polkinhorn & Mark Weiss
Junction Press, 382 pages, $25

Border perestroika collapsed on 9/11. In Vicente Fox, conservative America=
=20
had its dream come true =96 a Mexican president who could arguably be called=
=20
a Republican. Fox was certainly the first Coca_Cola executive to take the=
 helm.

He proposed a sweeping change on the border, and not in the usual=20
hand_wringing terms of human rights or the surly post_revolutionary cant of=
=20
the former regimes. No, Fox came at
George Bush with a simple message: capitalism. Mexico represented billions=
=20
of potential profit dollars to post_NAFTA America. "Border?" Washington=20
cried. "What border?"

Al Qaeda put an end to that.

The border situation worsens yearly. The death toll is rising. Both the=20
right and the left spout endless opinions in the face of a  mounting human=
=20
catastrophe, one side excoriating the illegals and the other spanking the=
 INS.

And it's not that our two great peoples don't want to get along. There are=
=20
proposals for immigration museums floating around both San Diego and El=20
Paso. (El Paso is probably going to win that race, with a=20
multimillion_dollar project under way at the University of Texas at El=20
Paso.) Rock and pop music now crosses borders with ease. Literature is=20
still sputtering, somewhat, but the Latino writers keep on coming. Perhaps,=
=20
as scholars have often suggested, it is the job of art and culture to=20
repair what has been destroyed by war and befuddled by politics.

OK, OK =96 the Salvation of the Border is an unfair burden to lay on a=
 humble=20
anthology of poems by my Baja California homies.

However, "Across the Line/Al Otro Lado" is a long_overdue eye_opener, a=20
harbinger of greatness to come. The alleged wasteland of our "benighted"=20
sub_border desert is, and always has been, teeming with literary life. It's=
=20
a great time for the arts in the Tijuana/Frontera nexus.

The revolutionary Nortec Collective, with their radical techno beats sliced=
=20
and diced from classic ranchero music, has subverted the music scene in the=
=20
United States, to the point where you hear Nortec when the new Volvo=20
commercial rolls across your teevee screen. Nortec has also inspired a=20
hearty writing community, featuring many young Mexican wild_women and=20
warriors of the pen. (Two of the Mexicali poets in the anthology are=20
rocanrol stars on the border.) In San Diego, the Taco Shop Poets are taking=
=20
matters into their own hands.

(If there is a failure on the literary border, it is the friction between=20
the Tijuana and San Diego writers. If they could form a unity of vision and=
=20
purpose, then something truly extraordinary and world_class might erupt=20
from our streets.)

"Across the Line/Al Otro Lado" should be required reading in our high=20
schools and colleges. Edited by Harry Polkinhorn and Mark Weiss, it=20
features a whopping 54 poets in face_to_face Spanish and English text.

As is often the case with English translations of Spanish material, some of=
=20
the translators have been timid, or even meddling. They sometimes try to=20
sound "Latin" in their translated elocutions, and the effort seems forced=20
and even tortured, when many of the originals sing.

This is, of course, a quibble. And it's a complaint that can be laid on the=
=20
translators of Octavio Paz and Pablo Neruda, too.

Weiss and Polkinhorn are excellent editors. Their introductory materials=20
are a handy, concise history of the literary movements of Mexicali, Tecate,=
=20
Tijuana, et al. I bet you didn't know they had a literary history. Start=20
being surprised. Possibly delighted.

Mexico doesn't know, either. If you feel a healthy dose of liberal guilt=20
about our bad attitude toward Baja California, rest assured that the=20
Mexican motherland has a worse problem. Baja is a strange, breakaway,=20
revolutionary area, an isolated dark continent unto itself, where dangerous=
=20
thoughts breed and wild independence is the rule. Baja makes Roger=20
Hedgecock and Vicente Fox nervous.

One of the many treats in this book is finding out how many small presses=20
there are on the Mexican side of the border. Yo, locos, are you kidding me,=
=20
or what =96 the index of authors lists some 20 small/university presses. Add=
=20
to that a healthy literary magazine community. Who wouldn't want to publish=
=20
a book with a press called Chuchuma? How many presses are there in=20
Calexico, I wonder? In Brawley?

Editor Weiss is the author of "Fieldnotes," one of the mostdelightful books=
=20
of American poetry of the last decade. It was criminally overlooked =96=20
perhaps an element of being a San Diego_based poet. "You simply cannot be a=
=20
poet in San Diego," a poet who fled that bastion on the hill, UCSD,=20
recently snarked to another, Chicago_based poet.

That may be true at UCSD, especially for the five or six Latino students=20
there. But step into the city and you'll find lively poetry  (ask Weiss).=20
Even more bubbles up from the barrio. And there is an absolute storm of=20
verse across the border. Poets, move to Tijuana!

Polkinhorn, Weiss' co_editor, has long been active in the Chicano/Latino=20
scene. His work helped keep the seminal journal Maize afloat way back in=20
prehistory. He is a scholar with many years of service at San Diego State.=
=20
(That's the college that actually has Mexicans in it.)

Not all the poets in this book are exemplary, or brilliant. But there has=20
never been an anthology in which every poet gave good weight. If you like=20
Bukowski, I'm not sure you'll get all a_tingle over Denise Levertov, for=20
example.

Still, with some leeway given for vagaries of taste, the poets in "Across=20
the Line/Al Otro Lado" are always interesting, and sometimes astounding.=20
Like many Mexican poets of the 20th/21st centuries, they owe a deep debt to=
=20
Neruda and Mistral. But the rigors of Paz and the sly dryness of Jose=20
Emilio Pacheco are also greatly in evidence. These aren't rustic slouches =
=96=20
these are poets engaged in the art, wrestling with structuralism,=20
postmodernism, minimalism, surrealism. One wonders where Juan Reynas,=20
Esali, Jose Javier Villarreal, Julieta Irigoyen, to name a few, have been=20
all these years.

Well, they have been here all along; we simply didn't know. Barring Laura=20
Bush =96 who, by the way, is a great fan of Latino writing =96 initiating a=
=20
norte=F1o poetry festival, this book might be the best place for us to=
 start.=20
I hope it is marketed in Mexico, too. My dear Baja is waiting to take its=20
proper place as the center of the literary map.

Ah, the globalism question again.  Literary historians have often pointed out that the invigoration of English poetry has depended on the translation and transformation of outside models (Wyatt transforms Petrarch, Pound transforms Li Bai).  I assume that this paradigm fits other literatures, too.  So does the Mexican-U.S. border situation represent an anomalous case?  From the review, I get the sense that the Mexicans are benefiting from their assimilation of outside influences, which would seem to confirm the historians' paradigm.  The droll suggestion that poets "move to Tijuana" (and commute to San Diego?) raises the further possibility that the best situation for poetry is by no means a "local" or "indigenous" one, but rather a place where there is maximum receptivity to at least two strong cultural traditions.  The U.S. would seem not to be such a place.  Also this suggests that as writers we should endorse globalism insofar as globalizing media make all national cultur
 es proximate.  Or?

(In any case, the anthology sounds interesting.)

Gore Vidal on the Complicity of the 'Bush junta' in the 9/11 Attacks
   from last Sunday's Observer:

The Inhumanity of Camp Delta; or The Complete Erosion of Civil Liberties in
the US
http://www.observer.co.uk/worldview/story/0,11581,825197,00.html

an excerpt:

"[...] Each man spends 30 minutes a week showering and exercising; the rest
of the time he is alone in a cell measuring 8ft by 6ft 8in.

"A prisoner raising his voice is sent to 'the cooler': a metal box just big
enough to move in. An isolation wing houses 80 prisoners. In the main wings,
prisoners move cell every few weeks to prevent them forming relationships
with other inmates. Any trips to the camp's clinic involve the prisoner
being shackled to a trolley and wheeled out of his cell. He is then chained
to the hospital bed. Prisoners are exercised, shackled at the ankles, waist
and hands. Guards hold each man's arms as he walks.

"Interrogations are carried out by operatives from a special unit called JTF
170, made up of agents from the CIA, FBI and military intelligence. No
beatings have been reported, but psychological techniques - including sleep
deprivation - are used. [...]

"There have been four serious attempts at suicide, three by hanging with
towels and bedding and one when an inmate tried to slash his wrists with a
plastic razor. Thirty other inmates have tried to injure themselves."

I went to St. John's College in Santa Fe and when I was there the
Witter Bynner house was used as off-campus housing. I never lived
there myself but went there a number of times. It was a beautiful large
rambling house with all sorts of nooks and crannies and various sheds
and additions, truly a work of art in itself. I think the college has since
sold it off, what a shame. I think Bynner gave it to the college since he
had no children. It was like the setting for a strange cult of poetics. I
also know he translated some ancient greek plays.

Part I - The Rueful Morgue



and the rueful morgue with its sisters of mercy, sisters.

never let it be said that something other than a word=20

or two or three in close succession can kill.=20



The rape of the Sabines in the mouths of some=20

would infer they brought it on themselves.



But let us not digress.



The point of this is pointed=20

where you want it.=20



A kind of voyeurism passed

mouth to mouth=20

month to month=20

and yet, no satisfaction.



Only shows some of her

symptoms sometimes. And that

sometimes never comes. It never comes.



And the old hag is not so green as she

is cabbage looking. They of the limpid

lingua languid clapshot altruism. Spit.



The murderess stands in the dock before the judge

No, that's not it at all.

She crawls on all fours



and it wasn't murder anyway

He died of natural causes

That part is easy.



Children wish people dead.

And then they die.



And you have seen inside her conscience.

You have seen.



The murderess?



Part II - The Rueful Morgue



and the rueful morgue with its sisters of mercy, sisters.

never let it be said that something other than a word=20

or two or three in close succession can kill.=20



It really is quite simple, had you driven through June

The effort, the effort, the court jester just did her best,

even, in a pinch, doubled in brass as the Inamorata.



She never could tell fantasy from fiction.



And when the audience wishes Shakespeare,=20

why here is Guildenstern.



Ask her to do the siren, she drinks it on the rocks.

Want a trip back to McSorley's?



Summon her, summon her

He comes when she calls.



And she calls a lot, whether or not

she is asked to. She calls a lot.



Only takes a quick change and

He said it was small change

on the floor. Ringing hollow.=20



And doesn't take the work seriously.

She must be lacking in intelligence.



But Bartelby was a scrivener, Gov'nuh. She wasn't a theoretician.



Couldn't change the spots on The Leopard and wouldn't bother.

But, yes. They killed the old roan all the same.=20



That must be evident. Just read to the end of the chapter.



And she sat and sits beneath the tree daily. The weight of letters=20

is enough to cripple her. They easily weigh eight tons if tons=20

had been translated into distance of sea.=20



One more than seven. Eight. The dedication of struggling.

The dedication of admitting. The dedication of thieves.



Is it possible that anyone cannot perceive the dedication of

a bow? It needed no translation. The gesture is eloquent.



In any language.



Did she look inside the ashes? She wanders there still

but cannot find the words for them. She never could.



Does not know where to look for them or find them, if she did.



That alone would cause the whole of you or some to

WORLD PREMIERE OF "FLAMINGO ROAD," A NEW PLAY BY KEVIN KILLIAN

Post-slapstick, post-career, post Ricky Ricardo, an elderly Lucille Ball
presides over her fabulous Miami estate, "Flamingo Road," where she has moved
since it's only ninety miles from Cuba. Her father, Austrian surrealist Hugo
Ball, has secret plans to legalize his union with Lucy's longtime companion,
Ethel Mertz. Struggling with the meaning of life, Lucy decides to make a bold
entry into the Guinness Book of World Records as the woman who did the most to
end the Cold War. She'll stop at nothing, even fraud, so she finds herself
interrogated by the Guinness secret police. Meanwhile her two grown children,
Lucy Jr and Antonio Banderas, face romantic dilemmas of their own. It's a play
about what it means to be an adult. To be human. And to be discovered hiding
baby Elian Gonzalez in one's capacious, oversized closet. With Norma Cole,
Kota Ezawa, Clifford Hengst, Scott Hewicker, Mac McGinnes, Karla Milosevich,
Rex Ray, Laurie Reid, Jocelyn Saidenberg and Wayne Smith.

interesting blog again as usual.  too bad you don't have a mailing list?  I
note the use of the ambiguous "a-" but I don't know if perhaps it was
intentionally ambiguous as it's difficult for me to imagine how writing can
be either anti society or a (above or aloof) society in general rather than
just particular elements of society?

The reason I'm addressing this to the poetics list as well is in the hope
that there still some life there. I was struck by your comments on Guest's
abstract lyric.  I see this as a potentially useful 'container' for a client
looking to gain enough poetic chutzpah to express some feelings (Oh no, I
know).  I'd be interested in others' thoughts on this.

It sounds what I imagined so far of Witter Bynner...one of those strange
characters who go their own way. I have only the one book. My information
tells me he was involved in an "attack" on Pound and the Imagists.  I found
the book by accident Scott my friend have a kind of (probably unconscious
"game" ) of "discovering" people (so he wouldnt like MY "discovery"
!!)...Scott (my friend's buzz I suppose is to find somone who everyone  (or
many)  thought was passe or who was "neglected" or some poet who writes an
enormous book, or som  eccentric (preferably with tragic circumstances): it
leads/lead us into some interesting finds even in New Zealand. It can be a
variety of "one-up-manship" but its better than lingering on life's eternal
street corners. Thanks.  Richard Taylor.

interesting comment, tom.
begs the question, "why the blog?" a question i'd be interested to pose to ron
now that he's been at it for a bit.
one of the most charactertistic elements of the blog is the metablog content- a
sign, i guess, of a young form. been waiting for some metablogging from ron-
timing's about right in the life of the blog cycle. been wondering when blog
fatigue will kick in. been wondering just ron eats for breakfast- where does he
find the energy to post so frequently? what keeps silliman's blog so regular?
so nutritional?


> The reason I'm addressing this to the poetics list as well is in the hope
> that there still some life there.

and there's no comments function on ron's blog, so if you want to respond to
the content publically, you must do so in a separate space.
this is another question i've been itching to raise with ron. the comments
function is such a standard blog feature that its omission glares, raises
questions about how much feedback the author really wants. ron's frequent posts
of portions of e-mail correspondance do undermine this monoblogue aura- though
the blog's title reasserts its univocality.

i've hesitated to post these questions here, largely because i find that
listservs bring out the absolute worst in me. i cringe at the few traces i've
left of myself here.
the community that makes up @poetics is so dispersed- i feel that i'm always
posting blindfolded- i suppose that creates some anxiety- that mixed with a
certain lack of palpable consequence- an uncertainty about addressees- in the
end, i barely recognize myself in my posts.

i'm finding better conversations happening in the interblog zones these days
than on listservs just generally.

one of the problems with blogs and metablogs and metamaetablogs for me
though is hat they tend to perpetuate the inwardly-impelled trned to closed
thought circuitry I think has been growing for awhile on the internet.fewer
and fewer people discuss a smaller list of topics and there is a certain
approved list of people that everyone knows better and better.  I think this
goes beyond typical academic closed-shop-minded thinking but just may be
partof the way people are?

thankfully, i think the days of "single most powerful influence" on *any
writing in the US are long gone. We are post-single-most.

Nuther issue: if by "writing" Ron here doesn't merely mean poetry, i don't
think it too harsh to call the statement a bit rash, sorry ron.

actually, my experience of blogging has been the exact opposite.
in blogging's early history, this was a greater problem- the A-lister circle
jerk, the "cross-referential bunch of obsessives," as one blogger put it.
i've found that even in the past year, this situation has dramatically altered,
as the number of bloggers and blogging sub-cultures has expanded and
diversified.
it feels as though the trend is expansive.

i do actually look forward to more metablogging as people who have done more
thinking about the writing subject and the public performance of text engage
the form.
there's still a heck of a lot more to be said.

k.

These files are remnants, residue, of larger works such as Trilby, 35
minutes in length. The still images are used in video; the .mov files
are chained together, modified; sound is added.

We collude between death and sex, to the limits of distortion - space-time
burns around configurations of terror and the body.

The skin is always a skein of communication. Words are performative only
to the extent they can persuade physical reality beyond the sememe -
propaganda or persuasion of language.

Sexuality, body, language, create a matrix of interpenetrations, an
almost impossible separation of interior and exterior. Space inflates,
the temporal dimension shudders, reverses, cycles, escapes.

The background of the work is in http://www.asondheim.org/index.html -
the Internet Text, which continues to be build.

New files will be added here from time to time and cdroms are available.

I thought as soon as I read this that it was a controversial claim, to say
the least.  Certainly she's *one* of the most influential.  But what about
Lyn Hejinian, Carla Harryman, Rae Armantrout, Jorie Graham, Sharon Olds,
Adrienne Rich, Lucille Clifton, Susan Howe, and at least a dozen others I
could probably list off the top of my head?  Obviously these are writers who
cover a wide spectrum of different schools and approaches, not all of whom
we all will admire equally, and maybe we're dealing with very specific
definitions of "powerful" and/or "new writing," but certainly the existing
population of younger women poets, even if we limit it to "experimental"
communities, is by no means a uniform mass of Guest-imitators.  For that
matter, a lot of male poets (including myself) have been influenced by Guest
as well, and a lot of male poets have influenced women writers.

As a matter of fact, I have some problems with the piece on abstract lyric
as a whole.  (Ron, just for the record, I think your blog is a great
thing--not least because I frequently find myself disagreeing with you in
ways that stimulate my own thought.)  To start with, the very notion that
"it is in the poetry of Barbara Guest that the form really comes into focus"
begs a lot of questions.  Was it not in focus in the work of Wallace
Stevens, for example?  Ron (or others), would you even consider Stevens an
abstract lyricist?  Hart Crane?  H.D.?  Dickinson?  Etc.?  Why or why not?

Ron, you define the A.L. as "a poem that functions *as a lyric*, bounded by
modest scale and focused on the elements within."  The italicized phrase
seems to explain only circularly.  Do you mean that it functions primarily
on the level of music (as opposed to, say, logical argument)?  This would
eliminate a lot of reflective, philosophical work that nevertheless strikes
me as "lyric" (e.g., Keats).  Do you mean simply that it is relatively short
(which seems to be covered by "modest scale")?  In what sense is A.L. any
more "focused on the elements within" than other kinds of lyric or poetry in
general?  The examples you give are often examples of compact syllabic
patterning, consonance, and so forth; are these the "elements within"?  Do
you mean that the A.L. isolates these elements as material language over
against their function as units of sense?  Again, isn't this true of a lot
of other poetry as well: that it foregrounds the signifier?

I'll accept that "not all short poems are lyrics," but in what sense is Rae
Armantrout's poetry "only incidentally lyrical, if that"?  This claim, more
perhaps than any other you make, bewilders me.  "Lyric in her case," you
write, "is a feint or strategy, but is very seldom what is actually going on
within the poem."  I'm fascinated by the idea of lyric as a "feint"--the
notion that lyrical effects can be randomly simulated or hastily
approximated rather than meticulously orchestrated, and that it might
nevertheless be very difficult for the reader to tell the difference.  But
how, then, is it possible to tell when lyric is *not* a feint?  When is it
"what is actually going on" as opposed to something that is ... what?  *Not*
going on?  Then how can it be perceived as a "strategy" or anything else?  I
don't have _Veil_ in front of me, but when I picture a page of it from
memory, "lyric" is one of the first terms that comes to mind, and elegant,
graceful lyric at that.  Have I been *fooled* in some way?

You provide a possible clue when you say that in comparison to Armantrout's
poems, Guest's are "as closed as sonnets."  The implied distinction here is
one between an "open," and therefore non-lyric, poetic, and a "closed," or
rule-based(?) one.  But can this possibly be right?  Do we really want to
say that intuitive, "pattern-free" (if patternlessness is ever possible)
composition can never count as lyric, or at least not as "abstract lyric"?

You compare Guest's poetry to Clark Coolidge's: "where Coolidge's works
revel in the sometimes raucous prosody of his intensely inventive ear,
Guest's return the reader again & again to the word and its integration into
a phrase, to a phrase and its integration into a line, to a line and its
integration into a stanza or strophe."  You go on to give some examples of
this multi-level integration in Guest, and oddly enough, the first thing
that came to my mind was a very methodologically similar recent reading by
Tom Orange of Coolidge's "Ounce Code Orange."  (Once more, I don't have the
reference or a reliable memory handy--Tom's piece is in either _New American
Writing_ or _Jacket_ or both, and it's a great essay, despite my vague
skepticism regarding this particular mode of close reading, which I too
indulge in from time to time.)  I won't quote at length, but I encourage
everyone to visit Ron's blog and decide for themselves whether the
syllable-counting in question can really yield the kinds of aesthetic
evidence that Ron claims for it.  I won't deny that the lines do exhibit an
admirable balance and sense of sonic precision that has something to do with
syllabic disposition, but I'm not yet convinced that it's a balance or
precision that can be explicated via quantification--that there is a
substantive difference, in terms of what can be materially demonstrated
through structural analysis, between Coolidge's "raucous prosody" and
Guest's "instinct for balance and closure."  The differentiating element
here would seem to have to amount to either intention or instinct, and if it
is the latter, as this last quote would suggest, the line is thin indeed
between Coolidge's reveling and Guest's integrating.

I've belabored this at such length not just because I'm ornery (tho I am one
ornery cuss), but because this is something I'm wrestling with a lot myself
at present.  So thank you, Ron, for the blog in general, and in particular
for this opportunity to flex my thinking-fingers on the question of lyric
"authenticity" vs whatever the opposite of such authenticity is.

At first, when some List members began advertising
their "blogs" (---I think that very few have actually
announced them on this List: basically, Brian Kim
Stefans, Lewis LaCook, and, with a vengence, Ron
Silliman, to my memory---),

it reminded me of Foucault's ~Technologies of Self,~

as if that book had predicted this.  In short, what
~Technologies~ says is that the two main forms by
which the West built up (the illusion of) Self  and
the subject, how the West invented subjectivity, was
through letter-writing and diary-keeping. Having been
through a letter-writing phase (for a short seven
years ---since March 1994?  The new List interface no
longer sub-divides into Archives and Early Archives),
for mysterious reasons the List atrophies and
"bloggers" begin to spawn off of it.  Is it that the
preliminary exercise of having practiced Self through
a communal letter-writing mode has nurtured a
sufficient basis of Self for them to individuate off
(as though "blogging" paralleled the maturational
phase away from family)?  Is it simple technophilia,
and that yesteryear's list craze has faddishly given
way to the new "blog" tech, so that the nomads will
follow the next technology thereafter, in turn?  Is it
a "sinking boat" phenomenon, whereby the
weak-of-stomach simply cannot tolerate the List decay
any further and go off on their life rafts?  Eulogies
might be in order.  Have List-productive periods
tended to depend on crops of graduate students who
cluster amongst themselves in their responses, so that
such academics "outgrow" their pupal List phase as the
encroaching responsibilities of their new job
placements narrow or channel their freedom of
expression, no longer at liberty to ad-lib
spontaneously,--- and that any yet-to-be-seen periods
of communal poetics must await the gradual and
accidental reconfiguration of a new crop?  (How much
of the now rarely seen List Stats records the vestiges
of defunct e-mail accounts in its tally?)

Oddly, the years when posts were screened by a monitor
(Chris, etc.), delayed in queue, and occasionally
"censored" were more productive to discussion than the
recent stage of effectively unmonitored twice-a-day
posting.

Is it 9/11 Syndrome?

The List and other List members have been a
means-to-an-end for many, and, having attained those
ends, they jettison the means that helped them there?
Has the Buffalo List ~exhausted its potential member
pool,~ so that there ~are~ no more poetry
experimentalists out there who have not passed through
its machinations, and these are the sum total
boundaries of the experimentalist population that we
are watching reach its collective limits?

Is it true that "bad money drives the good money out"?
Is it merely coincidental that the increase of blog
announcements happens at the same time as the
unprecedented increase of daily poem-posting?

---But, today, the buzz-word "alienation" is more on
my mind, and I'm more inclined to see alienation
written all over the face of the neo-"blog"-ism.
(...as if on Hannah Weiner's forehead: ALEINATION.)

Very simply, a shift from mediated one-to-one
e-communication to the sort of "sound-proof booth"
modality of blog is sort of self-evidently alienation,
a shift from dialogue and discussion to monologue and
soliloquy.

Even so, the blog announcements themselves take on
interesting hallmarks of "spammers," too: Ron's
latest, for example, was not confined to the Poetics
List, but has cc's to new-poetry@wiz.cath.vt.edu,
WOM-PO@LISTSERV.MUOHIO.EDU, and
BRITISH-POETS@JISCMAIL.AC.UK.  ---Which introduces
questions of the imagined/desired audience and,
basically, that Society of the Spectacle wins out, yet
again: anything that increases a disequilibrium toward
a state of spectators and "star" has the greater
magnetism, over time.

There were times when fevered disagreement set in
on-List about whether "poem-spamming" and
"advertisements" should be channeled off into a
separate sub-list and the List kept exclusively for
discussion.  Ironically, that argument has concluded
itself ~post facto,~ where the advertisements remain
and the medium for discussion may have extinguished
itself.

As said in the Geert Lovink quote that Lewis LaCook
posted, 10/31/02:

"With the current corporate take-over of the Net, one
can expect that the publishing activities will change.
. . . The Net itself will be a publication tool, to
announce new products, fashions, ideas, in short, a
new medium to manipulate people. The interactive,
democratic part will very soon become a mere marginal
aspect of the whole business. It will lose its
innovative and subversive part and will become deadly
boring. . . . The question is: do you have enough
power to go for the second round, to start all over
again, each time, after the net orgy will be over, to
start again . . ."

Hiya,

a blog creates a more formal and editorially controlled site. Blogs are kind
of fiefdoms against the commons of the lists? More like the boundaries of a
private house than a playground or the projects. A blog permits its
authorial persona to be seen to be porous only to that which somehow serves
or services its interests. Who is being listened to? With whom is there any
transgredience? It's level of activity becomes a flag of engagement. A blog
writer has no limit on how many times they post. They can prompt threads by
intervening into list flow with impunity. They dont have to mess up a list
with formatting aches or attachments  -  it offers measures of control
against the noise with which melody and rhythm on the lists are entwined.

interesting though

love and love
cris

I think that Blogs are Blogs: the reason is that  if a a rose is a rose etc
then as words can (theoretically) be interchanged) a blog is a blog.  A blog
could be a dog in the bog. But NOT a log. It could be  a log but then not a
dog....and when is a dog a dog? When its neither god or in a bog.  You can
DO logs but bogs you cant: these days logs arent used except if a
mathematician was stick in a bog without his Flog or his Glog.  But dont
flog the dog or plog the glogg: if you must blog then slog.  that's what I

And what parodies were those? No fair holding out on us, George. It's
election day and Richard Nixon is perched on my shoulder. Glowering.

You can always leave blank spaces in the middles of words, you know.

Funny, I just saw Ed Sanders on film for half a second in Jonas Mekas's
"Scenes from the Life of Andy Warhol." To watch the movie, you'd think
Andy spent half his life with Princess Lee Radziwill. When he wasn't
tying Jade Jagger's shoes.

What was Princess Lee princess of, anyway?

Scenes from a less beloved diner


I'm obsessed with the Pathetic effigies
              of the Past, crowing

In praise of motherfuckers and Deviants
                    of every color

The pitch is a message sent to an Earflap

Wrap a bandage Around my head and
                       I'm good to go

through red lights and barreling
                        into Crime Scenes

Our favorite inner city stories have
                come Back to pop Us

Take a photo, it'll last Until Easter
               then off to the races
               to pick up Thoroughbreds

Ever deny the crazy their Due

Whether high-sticking or Flopping
                to the ice, your
                time in the Box hurts

the cause, but is terrific for
                 flowers and Greeting cards

I will not translate from the Dutch

Or be held responsible for Stealing

If you can't follow the Logic
             rest Up and

Let the game come to You

Inside engines and calculators

the truth is Getting more Restless

Rachel asks what country was Lee Radzwill Princess of. The Principality lies
between the Czech Republic and Poland, a small area of land with an
interesting history. An early ruler, Max the Equivocator, who spoke English
with a thick MitttelEuropean accent,was being pressured by Prussia to throw
in his lot with that Power. His ministers urged against this. After decades
of deliberation, Max sprang to his feet and cried, in English, "Rats, I
will!" He then fell into a coma and died, without revealing what it was he
would--preserve the Principality's independence, ot fuse with Prussia?
        Max, a notorious bugger, left no issue, but his sister's son, Lem
the Latherer,seized the throne and rallied his countrymen to its defense.
Alrhough small in population, the Principality was surrounded by high
mountains on all sides,and was without apparent resources--the people lived
by dirt-scrabble farming, augmented by the sale of home-brewed alcoholic
beverages.
     The Principality has long since been absorbed by its neighbors and
turned into one of the primary ski-resorts of central Europe. This happened
after the Blue Danube Railroad Company tunneled through and laid track snd
built the spectacular bridge known among the locals as "The Maybe Bridge"
(it was expected to collapse, but so far hasn't) thereby knitting Prussia,
Poland and Czechoslovakia into a single region. The title of Princess
Radziwill outlived its country's sbsorption, and all persons such as
yourself, Rachel, who have an interest in these matters, (and God knows I am
one of them!) hope that the "Rats-I-wills" will bw around for as long as the
ski-resorts bring in enough cash to keep the castle in good shape and the
the Princesses shapely.    Hope this helps, David

Rick London & Eric Selland

Rick London lives in San Francisco. His publications
include Dreaming Close By (O Books) and several
chapbooks, most recently Picture With Moving
Parts (Doorjamb Press). He is currently co-editing
"Enough" with Leslie Scalapino, an anthology of new
writing in response to the political and
military fallout following the attacks of 9/11, due
out early in 2003.

from "going away"

rarely touching the ground

and easing other
conditions of time: naming, the sequence
of naming, of breath

removing both legs to inspect
the elements of walking
and other routines

lodged in animal fiber

and the eye moving, one
thing revealed, another
forgotten


Eric Selland is the author of The Condition of Music
on Sink Press. Recent work has appeared in Untitled
and First Intensity. Eric is also known as a
translator of Japanese poetry. Some of these can be
found on the Duration Press website. Eric now lives in
Belmont CA (next to San Mateo) where he works as a
translator of Japanese technical documentation.

                A sense of stillness
                Desire for stillness

                        Clay figures
                        Surrounding the room

The flowers and shrubs
Are silent

The lyric exfoliation of identity


Is the hurt named
        Numbing
                Numbering the years



Stopped in at the fish market for a bite and there was
M. sitting in a far corner of the room, her appearance
essentially unchanged from the last time I saw her
twenty years ago. What does the eye see? The majority
of functional memory hidden somewhere below the
surface.

Hope to see you there,

David is, as always, far too modest and humble. I guess it is left to
me to inform one and all about the name of the principality before
Max's expostulation. It was yclept Bromigenstein, after one of the
lowest mountains in the vicinity, and was known for the wild canaries
that flitted about the basin during the summer months. Many of the
northern Bromigensteinians mistook these lovely birds for large
butterflies and netted them for the purpose of diet supplementation.
But that is another story.

evening, & the word "local"

daydreams of being a palindrome

the pages of achievement

applied to the horses shut up in the sea

blindfolds pointed in the direction of arm-slings

heavenly mansions burned by rioters,

though the land is still marketable

- to a single end, Aspasia authorized
Virginia to requisition supplies -

discussion is freed from analysis by royal favor alone

Sotades issued a declaration

of justification whilst en route

to the cliffs of Epipolae

privileges and exemptions are

what make this world go 'round

else Virginia should be in league
with the stones in the field

minotaur-children stepped inside consumed Theseus

whom the Gods wish to destroy they first amaze

flint & steel straightened up a new signature

(the Terrors were ready to sign it "For you, Virginia")

              Can I trust you
              & admit Elefish
              had drifted out
              of my projections?

              the Jellyphant was
              grasped clubwise so
              I might defend
              my good name

born amongst her imperfect gravity

Virginia fainting upon the sofa

in habitual detestation

three or four doctors read

about your martinetish sightseeing

Virginia unloosed her ouphe and barghest hoop

next weekend, I'll become recently
interested in this little beast
like ashes set to bribing the coals

turn to puns, norms of well-behaved frames

confounded falseness begins with LADY GODIVA

[Gradiva?] red & nicety by the needle

competence too complex to engage the local

my lungs eat away at the Psalmist,

              my common sense tells me
              "readers are not witnesses"

              antecedent twists & turns claim
              and reclaim Virginia's charms

the mark of more than sufficient law is docility

letters wronged you, didn't they? I can tell!

              there's some discrepancy between
              freedom & biological functions

imperialism was touched off by

a syrup of violets

illicit gravedigging

thought to be indicative of bolshevism

my darling resemblance is a few steps away

              even a dip in the mirage
                 - O iron collar! -
              is shaken by occasion

the huge interiors shook within the custom

sunken functionaries live for her

debt fattened this calf

the Bishop's head hangs from my pommel

some trifle sinks heroes into banditry

you card, you threw them all

into postponing LAVBESP

Darren Wershler-Henry keeps posting at listervs to which I have no access
without becoming a member, and CCing his posts to a blog whose editor
doesn't care for rants.

Here I recently posted a D. W-H ventation addressed to me (but never sent to
me) in order to respond to it in a public forum to which I have access.

In another more vituperative and personal rant, he includes the following
UBPoetics assessment:

"i read your circulation of this debate to the buffalo list as a somewhat
telling demonstration of insecurity on your part, and fully expect that the
readers of said list will interpret it similarly."

My only "demonstration of insecurity" is a desire to openly debate this
question of the social word in a public forum.

Subject:      Decay into Self
MIME-Version: 1.0

Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

While I am enjoying the content of many marvelous blogs, such as Ron's, I
can't but help agree with Mr. Jullich on the relation of the blog to
solipsism and the general social/societal vector of the internet.  (Jeffrey,
pinch yourself.)  The blog is indeed wholly an indicator of a technological
retreat into the self, and it is an indicator of the decay and disfavor
increasingly found in re: email lists.  While people may bandy about voided
words to adorn their support for blogs, for hypertexts, etc., the rise of
the blog is wholly indicative of the solipsistic retreat that the Internet
promised from its very foundation, and the very retreat that has been
evidenced all along its development.  The internet is designed in part to
provide electronic cocoons for individuals.  It is an individuating tool,
the ultimate weapon for any divide-and-conquer strategy.  Customization is
designed for you, and only you.  YES YOU!  No, not him, not her, you.  Yes,
you, specifically you, not universally you.  The community builders of the
net forever swim upstream.

While possibilities within the manifold of the e-world seem to be opening,
they are related to a general decay of possibilities within the ur-manifold,
which is of course the world itself.  And those possibilities on-line become
a world of everyone with a soap box, where no one is listening.  Imagine if
everyone in America managed to obtain a radio frequency and started their
own country station.  While it is certainly liberating on the
self-expression front, and good for the MFA industry, it is wholly
suffocating for those who live in a world of many trying to truly,
*proximally,* interact.  How are we to wade through the crap?  How are we to
keep in touch, literally?  I guess that's ever a burden, but increasingly
so.

I rather obsessively spent a year (1999-2000) of my life writing about this
very phenomenon and it seemed not to register anywhere.  People "caught on"
to proximate.org but very few really seemed to "get it."  I even changed the
way I wrote poetry to express this phenomenon during that period...writing
confrontational poems where the "you" functioned quite specifically though
the word was clearly implemented generally.  An essay I wrote for VeRT about
poetic radicalism and the potentiality of the internet a year or two ago
received something like two responses.  An entire book of poetry remains
painfully unpublished, scalded by polite editorial confusion.

while what I was spouting did not really catch on, I did forget that it did
become recognized and incorporated into the rhetoric and analyses of some
writers and artists at sarai.net, a media lab in Delhi, India.

The very nature of the technology is to render its endpoints as
individuated.  And each computer is an endpoint, and each computer, one
person.  Person gets locked in, person tries to communicate, largely through
text.  Because proximity is lost in the communication, the gestures of
communication are lost.  And so people misinterpret those messages from one
another because of the absence of gestural content.  And then they blame it
on one medium within the network and flee to another.  (Hence the exodus
from people involving themselves in email discussion, and the increasing
amount of advertising within that medium...its last moments reveal what it
is.)  But they're already trapped, looking for the promise of far-reaching
intimacy, which is obviously an oxymoron.  Like "internet community."

>From a marketing standpoint, these features sure make custom marketing
schemes attainable.  Many of us know what it's like to have the opportunity
to promote our own work at places such as the Poetics list.  Damn sure it's
a great opportunity to get people interested in yr work, but it isn't so
great an opportunity to get any sort of emotionally valid engagement, and so
it ain't any sort of place to build a community.  unless of course you want
to build a community of robotic marketing reps (and frustrated folks too
afraid to vent anger as themselves, and so don new masks, which is the more
interesting of phenomena that the internet brings us).

There's your internet for you.  Brought to you by DARPA, "where success may
provide dramatic advances for traditional military roles and missions."

I am glad to see that perceptions along these lines are sharpening.

Under the following Rumsfeld P2OG plan, the United States government is
planning to use secret military operations to provoke terrorist attacks on
innocent people.  This IS what they are saying.  Donald Rumsfeld, Dick
Cheney, George W. Bush and the other Nazis in Washington plan to
deliberately provoke the murder of innocent people.  And they're advertising
it.  Waving it in our faces.



The Secret War

Frustrated by intelligence failures, the Defense Department is dramatically
expanding its 'black world' of covert operations
By William M. Arkin

William M. Arkin is a military affairs analyst who writes regularly for
Opinion. E-mail: warkin@igc.org
October 27 2002

SOUTH POMFRET, Vt. -- In what may well be the largest expansion of covert
action by the armed forces since the Vietnam era, the Bush administration
has turned to what the Pentagon calls the "black world" to press the war on
terrorism and weapons of mass destruction.

The Defense Department is building up an elite secret army with resources
stretching across the full spectrum of covert capabilities. New
organizations are being created. The missions of existing units are being
revised. Spy planes and ships are being assigned new missions in anti-terror
and monitoring the "axis of evil."

The increasingly dominant role of the military, Pentagon officials say,
reflects frustration at the highest levels of government with the
performance of the intelligence community, law enforcement agencies and much
of the burgeoning homeland security apparatus. It also reflects the desire
of Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld to gain greater overall control of
the war on terror.

Insulated from outside pressures, armed with matchless weapons and
technology, trained to operate below the shadow line, the Pentagon's black
world of classified operations holds out the hope of swift, decisive action
in a struggle against terrorism that often looks more like a family feud
than a war.

Coupled with the enormous effort being made throughout the government to
improve and link information networks and databases, covert anti-terror
operations promise to put better information in the hands of streamlined
military teams that can identify, monitor and neutralize terrorist threats.

"Prevention and preemption are ... the only defense against terrorism,"
Rumsfeld said in May. "Our task is to find and destroy the enemy before they
strike us."

The new apparatus for covert operations and the growing government secrecy
associated with the war on terrorism reflect the way the Bush
administration's most senior officials see today's world:

First, they see fighting terrorism and its challenge to U.S. interests and
values as the 21st century equivalent of the Cold War crusade against
communism. Second, they believe the magnitude of the threat requires, and
thus justifies, aggressive new "off-the-books" tactics.

In their understandable frustration over continued atrocities such as the
recent Bali attack, however, U.S. officials might keep two points in mind.

Though covert action can bring quick results, because it is isolated from
the normal review processes it can just as quickly bring mistakes and larger
problems. Also, the Pentagon is every bit as capable as the civilian side of
the government when it comes to creating organization charts and bureaucracy
that stifle creative thinking and timely action.

The development of the Pentagon's covert counter-terror capability has its
roots in the 1979 Iran hostage crisis. The Army created a highly
compartmentalized organization that could collect clandestine intelligence
independent of the rest of the U.S. intelligence community and follow
through with covert military action.

Known as the Intelligence Support Activity, or ISA, when it was established
in 1981, this unit fought in drug wars and counter-terror operations from
the Middle East to South America. It built a reputation for daring,
flexibility and a degree of lawlessness.

In May 1982, Deputy Secretary of Defense Frank Carlucci called the ISA
"uncoordinated and uncontrolled." Though its freelance tendencies were
curbed, the ISA continued to operate under different guises through the
ill-starred U.S. involvement in Somalia in 1992 and was reportedly active in
the hunt for Bosnian Serbs suspected of war crimes.

Today, the ISA operates under the code name Gray Fox. In addition to covert
operations, it provides the war on terrorism with the kind of so-called
"close-in" signals monitoring -- including the interception of cell phone
conversations -- that helped bring down Colombian drug lord Pablo Escobar.

Gray Fox's low-profile eavesdropping planes also fly without military
markings. Working closely with Special Forces and the CIA, Gray Fox also
places operatives inside hostile territory.

In and around Afghanistan, Gray Fox was part of a secret sphere that
included the CIA's paramilitary Special Activities Division and the
Pentagon's Joint Special Operations Command.

These commands and "white" Special Forces like the Green Berets, as well as
Air Force combat controllers and commandos of eight different nations report
to a mind-boggling array of new command cells and coordination units set up
after Sept. 11.

An Army brigadier general commands the Joint Interagency Task Force at
Bagram air base north of Kabul to coordinate CIA, Defense Department and
coalition forces in Afghanistan. A new Campaign Support Group has been
established at Ft. Bragg, N.C. The Special Operations Joint Interagency
Collaboration Center has been created in Tampa, Fla.

In Europe, the Joint Interagency Coordination Group handles
information-sharing and logistical support with NATO. Hawaii's Pacific
Command stood up a Joint Interagency Counter-Terrorist Group this summer.

Meantime, old commands are being morphed into new ones for the covert war.
The two Joint Interagency Task Forces in the United States previously
devoted to fighting drugs now have the war on terrorism as their highest
priority.

The epicenter of the Pentagon's covert operations remains the North
Carolina-based Joint Special Operations Command, often referred to as Delta
Force. The super-secret command is still not officially acknowledged to
exist. Its two-star commander, Army Maj. Gen. Dell L. Dailey, who spent much
of the Afghan war in Oman, has no public biography.

Among Dailey's assets is a fleet of aircraft specially equipped for secret
operations -- conventional and covert military planes and helicopters, and
even former Soviet helicopters. The bulk of those craft, including the
reconfigured Russian choppers, fly from airfields in Uzbekistan and from two
Pakistani air bases, Shahbaz and Shamsi.

The Air Force and the CIA collect additional intelligence from unmanned
Predator and Global Hawk drones. They also have low-profile reconnaissance
assets that look like transport planes and operate under such code names as
ARL-Low, Keen Sage, Scathe View and Senior Scout.

Not to be left out, the Navy's Gray Star spy vessel, reminiscent of the old
Pueblo, captured by North Korea in 1968, now sweeps up sophisticated -- and
obscure -- "measurements and signatures intelligence" to monitor the
ballistic missile capabilities of Iraq, Iran and North Korea.

Even with all this, the Pentagon wants to expand covert capabilities.

Rumsfeld's influential Defense Science Board 2002 Summer Study on Special
Operations and Joint Forces in Support of Countering Terrorism says in its
classified "outbrief" -- a briefing drafted to guide other Pentagon
agencies -- that the global war on terrorism "requires new strategies,
postures and organization."

The board recommends creation of a super-Intelligence Support Activity, an
organization it dubs the Proactive, Preemptive Operations Group, (P2OG), to
bring together CIA and military covert action, information warfare,
intelligence, and cover and deception.

Among other things, this body would launch secret operations aimed at
"stimulating reactions" among terrorists and states possessing weapons of
mass destruction -- that is, for instance, prodding terrorist cells into
action and exposing themselves to "quick-response" attacks by U.S. forces.

Such tactics would hold "states/sub-state actors accountable" and "signal to
harboring states that their sovereignty will be at risk," the briefing paper
declares.

Never to be outdone in proposing hardware solutions, the Air Force is
designing its own Global Response Task Force to fight the war on terrorism.
The all-seeing, all-bombing Air Force envisions unmanned A-X aircraft
capable of long-range, nighttime gunship operations and an M-X covert
transport, as well as hypersonic and space-based conventional weapons
capable of delivering a "worldwide attack within an hour."

Who says the arms race is over? Rumsfeld's science board warns against
overemphasis on equipment even as it recommends more. Washington is well on
its way to an arms race with itself.

And for those who worry that all these secret operations and aggressive new
doctrines will turn the United States into the world's policeman, there is a
ray of hope.

Rumsfeld is now the field marshal of the war on terrorism, but the Pentagon
is also creating new layers of bureaucracy that may save it from itself. Not
to mention the rest of us.

I doubt Bin Laden existed ever as a threat. Most likely an invention of the
CIA. He is  - if he exists  - probably on the CIA payroll.  This is a load
of crap. The purpose of the whole exercise is the US right wing to carry out
a war against the working people of the world. Communism - the people in
fact and the potential for communism or  states strong enough to resist the
US is the fear:  and most "terrorism"  if it exitsts is self defence such as
the freedonm fighters in Palestine who legitimately want freedom as do the
IRA. The other bombs (including Bali) are most likely planted by British or
US intelligence. It is time the US retreated from the countries it is
illegally occupying such as Turkey and Saudi Arabia the Phillipines and
South Korea and other places..We need the US like we need a pile of stinking
shit.. Richard.

History Book

A kid found its loose pages
On a busy street
He stopped bouncing his ball
To run after them.

They fluttered from his hands
Like butterflies.
He could only glimpse
A few names, a date.

At the outskirts the wind
Took them high.
They were swept over the used-tire dump
Into the grey river,

Where they drown kittens--
And the barge passes,
The one they named Victory
From which a cripple waves.

Louis,

once again, i post here against my better judgement but gosh darn it, i've
always wanted to use that subject line.
- against my better judgement, because your claims for your desires for an open
debate seem disengenious to me-
you did, after all, start this thing (i hesitate to call it a conversation) in
a private e-mail. the gesture to bring it into a public- but not open- space,
as far as i can see, was ron's.

i first noticed the post(s), and it was I who fowarded the link to lexiconjury,
a list whose membership is indeed restricted to the community that has formed
around the Toronto reading series of the same name. i thought it would be of
particular interest to us. in fact, quite a healthy conversation has sprung up
there around some of the issues you raised in your post- and i think this is
only possible because we know each other, we know each other's work, especially
the work that enjoys a much smaller distribution through chapbooks handed out
at readings, and through the readings themselves. and we have to face each
other on a regular basis.
as i am continually taking pains to point out when i find myself in
international poetic company, there's an exciting new energy in this particular
community, a lot of new voices, a desire to open up some space, to support
young writers, to challenge some of the crustier attitudes that have impeded
this work in the past. not going to blow my horn about the outcomes at this
time- but the will and desire and commitment is exciting, and contrary to a lot
of the opinions i hear circulated about this small part of the toronto poetry
community.


but i also responded to the post on my blog (http://www.meadow4.com/squish/)
which does have a comments field, and if you would like to have a reasoned
discussion about the question of the social word in that forum, you're more
than welcome. but, given that I also interpreted your assessment of Christian's
poethics to extend to others in his immediate aesthetic circle, (i think it was
the line about "christian and his toronto oulipian cohorts" that did it), i
hope you won't also call me a dimwit.
i've already been called a hick this week, and so i'm feeling a bit testy.

Outline of a Novel by the Storyteller Laureate of Hazlahan
   =20

I can feel the axe on my neck as they read me my contract
before the fatal swing:
The Storyteller Laureate of Hazlahan must produce one major literary =
work a year
and a story or poem each month
or else face execution
I thought it was a great honor to be appointed to the position
I had written a book a year for six years
that no one had actually read
(small presses don't market very well, you know)
The Storyteller Laureate publishes under the Imperial seal of Hazlahan
and his works are read in all the Universities
and papers are assigned to schoolchildren about each and every minor =
little poem
and it is extremely rare to get rejected
because the Storyteller Laureate is the head rejecter of all of Hazlahan
he is the ultimate arbiter
if someone wants to fight a rejection slip=20
they can request an audience with the Storyteller Laureate
to have justice done
but if it is dreck
the Storyteller Laureate
can recommend execution of the author in severe cases
or a total ban on submissions and publications
if the offense to good taste is less egregious
it is a dangerous thing to appeal to the Storyteller Laureate
but the Storyteller Laureate rarely rejects himself
and as the Emperor of Hazlahan is illiterate
he does not often exercise his Imperial Veto power on the Storyteller's =
publications

oh what a nice thing to be Storyteller Laureate
but I have violated my contract
it is the end of December and by January first I must produce a major =
work
I am prohibited from working on any holidays and December 19th is the =
Emperor's Birthday
traditionally the work is presented to him then
all bound and covered with positive blurbs
from various Imperial officials
and official literary lights

It's not that I don't feel a novel coming on
I can feel it coming out of me fully formed
jam-packed with action and pungency
but every time I try to write it down it sneaks back inside
in out in out in out in out
it hurts to strain so much
it strikes me that if the novel could be made less solid
more fluid, more stream of consciousness and ghostly in its narration
less intense
it might slide out of me more easily

the last Storyteller Laureate was blessed with the gift of logorrhea
he had only to sit down
and novels and pays and poetry collections
came shooting out of him
in a spray of mediocrity with tiny lumps of quality mixed in

when they appointed me they wanted somebody a bit more controlled
more regular
less diarrhoic in my prose
and for several years I fit the bill nicely
but now I have constipation of the imagination
it could be because my last book was too visionary
and when i was interviewed about the wonderful symbolism in it
I said, "what symbolism?
there really is a purple two headed weasel living inside each and every =
person
feeding on intestinal content
and directing our souls.
My weasel talks to me all the time,
and so I know how to behave so as to be saved in the final Apocalypse
the key to life is learning to hear the weasel within
seeing the weasel is yet another step towards salvation
if you are fully mindful
you will see the weasel whenever you look in the mirror
and summon it
your skin will become transparent
and you will see the outline of your intestines
with the two-headed weasel swimming inside
that is the goal of life"

after this
my daily orange juice started tasting funny
and I was no longer certain about the existence of the weasel within
I spied around the palace one day and discovered
that the Court Physician had ordered a philtre of Haldol
to be added to my breakfast
each day
and I couldn't protest
because disobeying the Court Physician
is grounds for execution
as is poking into the Physician's activities
he is allowed to operate totally without the patient's knowledge
to avoid false cures caused by false hopes
or reactions of a sick mind against the Physic which will make it better

however I had heard=20
that Haldol slows down the movements
of the mind as of the intestine
killing the weasel
and my novel
in one fell swoop
it could be that this was deliberate
as I have heard rumors
that the Court Physician would like to become Storyteller Laureate
and my execution would serve his nefarious purposes

so each morning
I poured my orange juice down the gullet of the Court Cat
and watched it get stiff and sluggish
as my novel wrote itself down
as quickly as I could type

saved...
and my intestines also
have begun to produce
fine output
for the Imperial Compost Pile
for which I get paid extra
by the bushel basket
isn't life sweet!

found myself trying to explain 'abstract lyricism'to someone today (college
educated, bright, but never exposed to much in the way of litereature and
writing courses) and discovered that after a brief discussion of basic terms
it was fairly simple if I've got it right?  I enclosed at the end here
definitions of terms from The Cambridge which does include thought as well
as feeling in 'lyric'.  I assume the 'abstract' here doesn't necessarily
refer to the abstract/concrete dimension (even though on a sidetrack it
could but then I would see the abstract lyric as  more concrete lyric than
abstract lyric?).

If my experience is more general as i suspect it is this does seem to make
this type of poetry more accessible for the common reader in the sense that
it makes it something thatis liked or hated but at least there is a
reaction.   It also of course can be seen as a return to modernity which may
or may not be a good thing?

abstract (GENERAL)
adjective
existing as an idea, feeling or quality, not as a material object, or (of an
argument, discussion, etc.) general, not based on particular examples
Truth and beauty are abstract concepts.
Her head's full of abstract ideas about justice and revolution.
This debate is becoming too abstract (=general) - let's have some hard
facts!

Abstract describes a type of painting, drawing or sculpture which tries to
represent the real or imagined qualities of objects or people by using
shapes, lines and colour, and does not show their outer appearance that
would be seen in a photograph.
abstract art
an abstract painter

lyric
adjective [not gradable]
(esp. of poetry and songs) expressing personal thoughts and feelings

An Invitation to Two Events:

=======
BOOK LAUNCH:
EILEEN TABIOS' REPRODUCTIONS OF THE EMPTY FLAGPOLE

7 p.m., Thursday, November 14, 2002
Asian American Writers Workshop
16 W. 32nd Floor, 10th Floor
New York, N.Y. 10001
For more info: desk@aaww.org

While launching her latest poetry collection, Reproductions of the Empty
Flagpole (Marsh Hawk Press), Eileen Tabios' presentation will include a
circling back to her first book, the ground-breaking Black Lightning:
Poetry-In-Progress (AAWW, 1998).  Joining the celebration will be Black
Lightning poets Kimiko Hahn and John Yau; a Q&A with the three poets will
follow.

Further reflecting her poetics of interconnectedness, Eileen's reading will
include the poem "Corolla" which was created partly from a collage of works
by over 50 Filipina writers.  She will present "Corolla" through two
multidisciplinary collaborations: the first with multi-awarded performance
artist Johanna Almiron, and the second with poet and jazz stylist Cristina
Querrer, accompanied on piano by Duncan "Don" Profitt.  The collaborations
also will be presented unrehearsed since Eileen doesn't practice a Poetry
that can be rehearsed.


Eileen also will read (with other Marsh Hawk poets) at

1 p.m., Saturday, November 16, 2002
Bowery Club
308 Bowery @ Bleecker, right across from CBGB's
New York City

For more information about Eileen's poetry collection, including advance
words by Arthur Sze, Forrest Gander, Barry Schwabsky, Susan Schultz and
Alfred Yuson, see www.MarshHawkPress.org

And faces get even Colder.
                           I've been on the
                        Shit end of transactions

Between lesser known Messengers and
                their prophets, I've dashed

the hopes of PTOs and religious Orders

Only to find myself Solid amid Fetish
                    Uniforms and Aroused

In spite of my role as a Mentor

Cradle and comfort Those worth
                   the trouble

Belay the orders of the Chorus
                Who warn endlessly
                to Flee embraces

for third parties That sound too good
                and too true

Jostled when we should be relaxed
                 or Sated, fearful
                 of Reprisals

Kick in my door to Discover me hanging
                where I've always Been

Feet from the ground, prime property
            the price is Right

bitter tears. Bitter.

Sometimes, or yet often? The canon

One never uses fine steel to make a nail.

And if the protecting veil offered no protection?

Offer them power of eagles and or ravens.

Would simply ignore.

It might be worthwhile if posters here on this continually appearing topic
tookk a look at some current research from a perspective that makes sense to
me and runs counter to current TVlevel thing on the madness question.
Philip Zimbardo, president of the APA and of some past noteriety, has a
piece in the latest APA _Monitor_ on this (I think there is some research
available on this and it should start reseaching media sources in a year or
so.

I mention it here as it does relate to 'narrative drive'. according to the
theory madness stems from discontinuity (often a blow to self esteem)
coupled with "resoning with insufficient data, or rigidly defending the
wrong theory" powered by narrative 'drive."

Maria, I have only the immortal words of football coach Bill Parcells to
offer you.  Asked what he does after a bad loss, he replied, "Well, what I
do is, I don't sleep all night, and then in the morning I puke in my mouth
a couple times and get back to work."     -m.

Maria - the hope this time is like the hope for all times, in the future.
The paltry showing on all fronts by Democrats suggests that they should
dispense with middle-of-the-road DLC campaigning, and go back toward the
Left.
Democratic Leadership Council (DLC) policy, guided mostly by VP ex-candidate
Lieberman and centrist business interests, built a coalition of fairly
spnservative democrats who could win, while at the same time dumping or
severly curtailing old Democratic warhorses like labor, except, of course,
for lip service.
Politics over the last ten years has become increasingly and more openly a
matter of wrecking crews from each side trying to sink each others'
financial; support; Clinton goring Big Tobacco and Insirance resulting in
the national distress over The Dress, which was stained, by the way, not
with semen, but with tobacco juice; Willy got smoked.
The same thing is going oin behind the scenes "even as we write" -
The 'pubs've got the likes of Big Oil & Insurance Companies, while the
dems've got computer chips (Gatesville), big investment firms through the
likes of Warren Buffett, Coca Cola & the Washington Post Chain. So,
any real word of consolation wld have to be that there is a lot of studying
for us all to do in order to understnad how it might that this double-sided
thingless thing can be encouraged to bring itself down.  To a "see-able"
level.  It's the same old thing: follow the money.  The trail keeps getting
increasingly obvious, because very few follow it.  But eventually someone
will, and DC, all sides, will get caght like (Dorn said) "a briefcase with
its pants down."  Start pulling.
Catr

We'll all be dead in less than a century, Maria. Meanwhile, there are
cartoons, lampoons, conjugal visits and full moons at the beach; and
children (get your hands on as many as possible) to teach that it is wrong
to steal elections, especially by murder, and that the symbolic elephant has
been fired in favor of a leech.
                  Yours,  David

A friend wrote this today: "The only consolation is that the way most people
are, things have to get a lot worse before they can get better--and if we're
headed for a train wreck at least it will be clear who was in charge (and
therefore who's to blame, one can only hope) when it happens!"

This is the "boil" theory of American politics: things have to get really
ugly before they can get lanced. It explains why some of us thought Nader
was a good alternative even though our votes might have indirectly helped to
elect Bush -- the psychopathy would be more evident and easier to identify.
It of course presumes that we don't all die and/or become destitute first.

"We'll see." Meanwhile, remember Nick's post about the Adorno paradox?
"Whoever pleads for the maintenance of this radically culpable and shabby
culture becomes its accomplice, while the man who says no to culture is
directly furthering the barbarism which our culture showed itself to be."
For "culture" one could substitute "Democratic party" -- not that it's any
more consoling.  But, you know, people looking for solutions are probably on
the wrong list.

Meanwhile, this quote from Gore Vidal (thanks for those links, Patrick)
might be relevant: "And the liberals, of course, are the slowest and the
stupidest, because they do not understand their interests. The right wing
are the bad guys, but they know what they want -- everybody else's money.
And they know they don't like blacks and they don't like minorities. And
they like to screw everyone along the way.

"But once you know what you want, you are in a stronger position than those
who can only say, 'Oh no, you mustn't do that.' That we must have free
speech. Free speech for what? To agree with The New York Times?"

The post-canon canon was firing a few days ago when I
was re-reading E.E. Cummings' 50 poems and I began to
wonder about his legacy. He's never been quite
embraced by the avant-garde, the langpos, the new
lyricists or any collective whose production of work
is dependent, however tangentially, on some of
Cummings' innovations.

Looking back through 50 Poems, which I hadn't read in
years, I felt the incredulity of a tourist stepping
from the dark of the train station into mid-afternoon
Venice: retro-cascades of typescript, porticoes of
blank spaces, uncoupled parenthesis. A
once-new-and-now-very-old-seeming land built from
syntax up.

Sometimes, it's true, the garbled typography is simply
annoying, or at best, something dated, a curiosity
like the Cadillac, designed in the fifties with fins
and rocket lights intended to convey a futuristic
design but appearing to us, retrospectively, as a
quirky miscalculation.

But other poems, such as "Somewhere I have never
travelled, gladly beyond," seem the work of a severely
mentholated Elizabethan and are succesful as such. And
I was struck anew with the materiality of his poems,
the reliance on shape that seems a precursor to some
forms of concrete poetry, and I wonder why Cummings'
is so often ignored by those who, it would seem,
derive parts of their thematic flourish from his
explorations. Is it because his lyric content, so
laden with abstractions, is as normative and contrived
as his syntax is radical? Is it because he became a
"popular" poet and there's great antipathy and
suspicion cast on such status? Is it because he
overproduced, watering down true innovation with a sea
of replicas?

I'm curious what others think of Cummings and how his
reputation now rates...

MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="iso-8859-1"
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

 The Department of English at the University of Calgary invites abstracts
for
 papers to be presented at the 2003 Free Exchange graduate conference:

 trans/actions

 March 7-8, 2003
 University of Calgary

 The aim of this year's conference is to investigate the stakes and the
politics
 involved in various types of movements across, acts of exchange, and forms
of
 resistance.  As such, you are invited to parse our title however you wish
and
 enter this discussion by focusing on trans-, transactions, or actions.

 These are some of the questions we're asking:

 What movements and changes occur across segments of space and time?  How is
our
 relationship to spatio/temporal borders affected by globalization, free
trade,
 and the (potentially) instant transmission of information and capital?  by
the
 rhetoric of equality?  accessibility?  justice and just war?  Who gains
when
 these borders are crossed?  How can we engage in kinds of time travel that
seek
 to do other than merely co-opt the past?  or usurp the future?

 What is gained and lost in our exchanges with each other (interpersonal,
 economic, textual, etc.)?  Is there such a thing as "free exchange"?  Who
 places value in such transactions?  What happens to heterogeneity and
hybridity
 in the context of a universal token of currency?  Is there still room for a
 surplus?  Does it become merely a "token minority"?  What happens to power
in
 the act of exchange?  to representation?  to meaning?

 What (actions) can our bodies speak?  How can such discourse interrupt the
 continuities of power structures?  What changes are produced by these
 interruptions?  What kinds of agency function in not acting as well as in
 acting?  in mimicking?  in ventriloquizing?  in repeating?  How is the body
 implicated in cognition and language?

 Possible themes include, but are not limited to:

 cultural exchange,
 globalization,
 travel narratives,
 technology,
 embodied cognition,
 history,
 politics of identity,
 innovative poetics,
 foreign policy,
 prospective fiction,
 futurity,
 hybridity,
 post-humanism,
 the subject-in-process,
 performativity.

 We encourage critical, creative and interdisciplinary responses in the form
of
 20-minute presentations.  Please send 250-word abstracts to:
 free_exchange@yahoo.com

Deadline for submissions is January 6, 2003.

it's easier in war. realize the apocalyse has already happened. the
slaughter-extinction of the world began in wwi. inhabit the other
side after the dawn has occurred, after dusk inadvertently slips
through the night. the horror we generate is a generation of horror:
release it.

performative happening somewhere else


all my colors are garish - i'm ill again - slight fever - headache -
chills - forgive me - my dashes - i speed past celine - a realization -
there is no performative - the performative doesn't exist - material
refractions - that's all - wedding vows - everything - require concrete
embodiment - that's how it is - it's all physical states - the state-space
of the machine - things changing - state-space to state-space - surface
residue on the screen - ascii or otherwise - all sorts of things - words
continuing on another level - we've got to be careful here - among the
internal matrix of meaning of language and orienting of cognitive domains
- and transformations of material strata - i've always written about the
political economy of language - the necessity of the scream or demand or
cry of the wounded or orgasm or laughter - not necessarily in that order -
it's an economy that exfoliates and effuses within its own sememe - its
own space and own ontology - epistemologically it wanders like everything
else - but that space concretely presents the potential abundance of
material operations - it's not that i'm a materialist - in spite of my
sore throat and shivering - but that the material world carries on the
discredit of language - it's all a mix we pass for intelligence as if
writing and theory were an 'however' summarizing the abstract configura-
tion of the day - thought is internal/external - panoplies of tendrils
among laminanimal - can you imagine - it doesn't reside one way or another
- instigated by mental operations hardly to the discredit of the material
world - the performative is in the speaking or writing - my fingers on the
keys - my vocal cords and enunciations - literally a far cry - i can
hardly focus now - but the theory of performativity has to be radically
revised - i can assure you - the point it's missing is elsewhere - not
even peripheral - not even a 'somewhere else' - i'm hard put to hypothe-
size the bridges - mappings of all sorts - internal neural mappings to
external manipulations - all machinery - all electronics - is the lever -
my eyes are hurting - this goes on and on - the doctors can't do a thing -
they keep asking questions - sending me from one to another - keep filling
out forms -

TEMPERATURE, RISING
The border region is burning with literary fever; 'Across the
  Line/Al Otro Lado' captures the poetry of Baja

Reviewed by Luis Alberto Urrea November 3, 2002

The Poetry of Baja California
Edited by Harry Polkinhorn & Mark Weiss
Junction Press, 382 pages, $25

Border perestroika collapsed on 9/11. In Vicente Fox, conservative America=
=20
had its dream come true =96 a Mexican president who could arguably be called=
=20
a Republican. Fox was certainly the first Coca_Cola executive to take the=
 helm.

He proposed a sweeping change on the border, and not in the usual=20
hand_wringing terms of human rights or the surly post_revolutionary cant of=
=20
the former regimes. No, Fox came at
George Bush with a simple message: capitalism. Mexico represented billions=
=20
of potential profit dollars to post_NAFTA America. "Border?" Washington=20
cried. "What border?"

Al Qaeda put an end to that.

The border situation worsens yearly. The death toll is rising. Both the=20
right and the left spout endless opinions in the face of a  mounting human=
=20
catastrophe, one side excoriating the illegals and the other spanking the=
 INS.

And it's not that our two great peoples don't want to get along. There are=
=20
proposals for immigration museums floating around both San Diego and El=20
Paso. (El Paso is probably going to win that race, with a=20
multimillion_dollar project under way at the University of Texas at El=20
Paso.) Rock and pop music now crosses borders with ease. Literature is=20
still sputtering, somewhat, but the Latino writers keep on coming. Perhaps,=
=20
as scholars have often suggested, it is the job of art and culture to=20
repair what has been destroyed by war and befuddled by politics.

OK, OK =96 the Salvation of the Border is an unfair burden to lay on a=
 humble=20
anthology of poems by my Baja California homies.

However, "Across the Line/Al Otro Lado" is a long_overdue eye_opener, a=20
harbinger of greatness to come. The alleged wasteland of our "benighted"=20
sub_border desert is, and always has been, teeming with literary life. It's=
=20
a great time for the arts in the Tijuana/Frontera nexus.

The revolutionary Nortec Collective, with their radical techno beats sliced=
=20
and diced from classic ranchero music, has subverted the music scene in the=
=20
United States, to the point where you hear Nortec when the new Volvo=20
commercial rolls across your teevee screen. Nortec has also inspired a=20
hearty writing community, featuring many young Mexican wild_women and=20
warriors of the pen. (Two of the Mexicali poets in the anthology are=20
rocanrol stars on the border.) In San Diego, the Taco Shop Poets are taking=
=20
matters into their own hands.

(If there is a failure on the literary border, it is the friction between=20
the Tijuana and San Diego writers. If they could form a unity of vision and=
=20
purpose, then something truly extraordinary and world_class might erupt=20
from our streets.)

"Across the Line/Al Otro Lado" should be required reading in our high=20
schools and colleges. Edited by Harry Polkinhorn and Mark Weiss, it=20
features a whopping 54 poets in face_to_face Spanish and English text.

As is often the case with English translations of Spanish material, some of=
=20
the translators have been timid, or even meddling. They sometimes try to=20
sound "Latin" in their translated elocutions, and the effort seems forced=20
and even tortured, when many of the originals sing.

This is, of course, a quibble. And it's a complaint that can be laid on the=
=20
translators of Octavio Paz and Pablo Neruda, too.

Weiss and Polkinhorn are excellent editors. Their introductory materials=20
are a handy, concise history of the literary movements of Mexicali, Tecate,=
=20
Tijuana, et al. I bet you didn't know they had a literary history. Start=20
being surprised. Possibly delighted.

Mexico doesn't know, either. If you feel a healthy dose of liberal guilt=20
about our bad attitude toward Baja California, rest assured that the=20
Mexican motherland has a worse problem. Baja is a strange, breakaway,=20
revolutionary area, an isolated dark continent unto itself, where dangerous=
=20
thoughts breed and wild independence is the rule. Baja makes Roger=20
Hedgecock and Vicente Fox nervous.

One of the many treats in this book is finding out how many small presses=20
there are on the Mexican side of the border. Yo, locos, are you kidding me,=
=20
or what =96 the index of authors lists some 20 small/university presses. Add=
=20
to that a healthy literary magazine community. Who wouldn't want to publish=
=20
a book with a press called Chuchuma? How many presses are there in=20
Calexico, I wonder? In Brawley?

Editor Weiss is the author of "Fieldnotes," one of the mostdelightful books=
=20
of American poetry of the last decade. It was criminally overlooked =96=20
perhaps an element of being a San Diego_based poet. "You simply cannot be a=
=20
poet in San Diego," a poet who fled that bastion on the hill, UCSD,=20
recently snarked to another, Chicago_based poet.

That may be true at UCSD, especially for the five or six Latino students=20
there. But step into the city and you'll find lively poetry  (ask Weiss).=20
Even more bubbles up from the barrio. And there is an absolute storm of=20
verse across the border. Poets, move to Tijuana!

Polkinhorn, Weiss' co_editor, has long been active in the Chicano/Latino=20
scene. His work helped keep the seminal journal Maize afloat way back in=20
prehistory. He is a scholar with many years of service at San Diego State.=
=20
(That's the college that actually has Mexicans in it.)

Not all the poets in this book are exemplary, or brilliant. But there has=20
never been an anthology in which every poet gave good weight. If you like=20
Bukowski, I'm not sure you'll get all a_tingle over Denise Levertov, for=20
example.

Still, with some leeway given for vagaries of taste, the poets in "Across=20
the Line/Al Otro Lado" are always interesting, and sometimes astounding.=20
Like many Mexican poets of the 20th/21st centuries, they owe a deep debt to=
=20
Neruda and Mistral. But the rigors of Paz and the sly dryness of Jose=20
Emilio Pacheco are also greatly in evidence. These aren't rustic slouches =
=96=20
these are poets engaged in the art, wrestling with structuralism,=20
postmodernism, minimalism, surrealism. One wonders where Juan Reynas,=20
Esali, Jose Javier Villarreal, Julieta Irigoyen, to name a few, have been=20
all these years.

Well, they have been here all along; we simply didn't know. Barring Laura=20
Bush =96 who, by the way, is a great fan of Latino writing =96 initiating a=
=20
norte=F1o poetry festival, this book might be the best place for us to=
 start.=20
I hope it is marketed in Mexico, too. My dear Baja is waiting to take its=20
proper place as the center of the literary map.

Ah, yes.  Apocalypses!  With their spectacle of
red-rouged Whore of Babylon (anti-feminist, the e-poet
Mez has pointed out to me) and Seal of The Beast (bad
P.E.T.A.), all very Fellini.  Read backwards, it's

           ESP-y La Copa !

I, too, have been overly fond of apocalypse, in my
day.

The poet Jane Miller wrote that, in apocalypse,
everyone goes through the misery together, ~everyone.~
So it's antithetical to individual suffering.


Maybe some "consoling thoughts, words, bromides,
slogans, lines, epithets" are to be found in the
serendipity of today also being the day that---
actress Winona Ryder was found guilt of shop-lifting,
in Beverly Hills!

Twice now, I've been out on the street and seen
suspiciously effeminate men wearing T-shirts that read
"FREE WINONA", with a stencilled caricature of her
behind bars.

http://www.bobfromaccounting.com/bfastore/freewinonadetails.html

People have stencilled pumpkins "FREE WINONA":

http://www.yque.com/frewinmiscle.html .


If the Republican Party is the vehicle that most fully
serves and manifests the historical-economic force
that we naively used to call "capitalism,"--- then
where's the surprise that it's increasingly propelled
into full execution of those prerogatives, and that
everything is swept up into its momentum,

as if unbelievably driven by the winds from the
flapping of the Angel of History's wings?   :)



Rick Lyman reports in The New York Times, 11/07/02:

'Today, after the verdicts, Ms. Rundle [deputy
district attorney] was asked if prosecutors knew why
the actress had commited the crimes.

'"I cannot get inside her head," she said.  "She may
have been stealing for the thrill of it or to see if
she could get away with it."'

http://www.nytimes.com/2002/11/07/national/07WINO.html


Meanwhile, over in Adam Nagourney's article in the
same issue, other people are also asking an Unanswered
Question:

'The loss forced a day of soul-searching and
hand-wringing among Democrat officials intent on
figuring out what had gone wrong, and what it meant
...'


Perhaps, in a sense, the "what had gone wrong" that
Democrat officials search after and "why the actress
commited the crimes" and what it meant come down to
the same Charles Dodgson answer: an unstoppable,
hypnotic, compulsive drive against conscience, reason,
or moderation, toward glitz, lucre, inanity, doggerel,
hyperreality; the two coasts flanked by their
respective grands dames: the 105 year-old Madame
Chiang Kai-shek living out her last months on the
Upper East Side in Manhattan with her three dogs,
Winona in Beverly Hills.

How could they have voted the way they did?  Why had
the actress commited the crimes?


It can be very instructive and revealing, what sort of
tactics and aesthetics people choose when they're
finally, irreconcilably overwhelmed into an apparently
interminable defeat and powerless against an
invincible imperial force.  How do you resist the
unbeatable?  There's an introduction to an English
translation of The Mishnah that suggests that that's
what the Talmudists were doing.  While the Rome that
had overpowered them was devoted to nothing so much as
the monumental, the colossal, Hadrian's immense
marbles, grandeur,--- the pharisaic Jews, having lost
everything and with no hope beyond faith, converged
upon a project of the picayune, the fussy, the small,
the lost, encyclopedic minutiae, in the assembling of
The Talmud.


"The Talmud specifies how we can accurately
distinguish between kosher and non-kosher eggs. Any
egg that has both ends that are either rounded or
sharp is definitely the sign of a non-kosher egg. The
rounded edge represents suffering and the sorrow of
mourning. For the Talmud tells us that mourning is
like a sphere which revolves around the world,
eventually reaching everyone. The egg's sharp edge
represents the exact opposite of the round edge,
denoting laughter and rejoicing. People who
exclusively live for the pleasures of this world, who
are frequently found celebrating at empty and
meaningless parties and indulging in many other empty
pleasures, pay little or no attention to the
inevitable final, solo, one way trip we must all make
to the cemetery."

http://www.breslov.com/world/parsha/vaeschanan_5754.html


The Times reports that Winona stole $5,500 worth of
designer goods from a Beverly Hills department store:

"including a cashmere Marc Jacobs sweater worth $760,
various Frederic Fekkai hair adornments worth about
$600 and several pairs of socks, including a cashmere
pair from Donna Karan worth $80, inside two shopping
bags and a garment bag."

But--- $760 + $600 + 80 does not equal $5,500 worth of
designer goods!

$760 + $600 + 80 = *$1,440!*

Isn't this artfully concealed discrepancy just more
proof of the unabashed trammeling of justice that goes
on in this country!?

WHAT were the remaining $4,060 worth of designer goods
that Winona supposedly took!?


And WHY isn't that hateful New York Times TELLING
US!!?

For what it's worth, I think list discussions are still productive.  They may even have become less dogmatic than they were 4 or 5 years ago, now that Language writing has lost most of its cachet (or adopted a Popular Front mentality, I'm not sure which).  I suppose criteria will differ on what constitutes a "productive" posting.  For my money, it's one that instigates an unpredictable thread and doesn't try to have the last word on a given topic.  I don't read the poems posted to the list because they are bad and therefore do not, as poems, fulfill the basic criteria: to provoke a discussion that will get us someplace new.  There could be only three people contributing to the discussion and it wouldn't matter so long as the postings were usefully strange and unexpected -- which still happens often enough to keep me interested.  I share the low opinion of blogs.

Ammiel Alcalay is a poet and a translator from Hebrew, Arabic, and
Bosnian. He has done a lot to make the American reading public
acquainted with Hebrew poetry, Arabic poetry, Arabic poetry by Jews,
and Bosnian poetry.

CRITICAL PERSPECTIVES ON THE WAR ON TERROR
A SPEAKERS SERIES ORGANIZED BY THE
CORNELL FORUM FOR JUSTICE AND PEACE
www.geocities.com/cfjusticepeace/

AMMIEL ALCALAY
Professor of Comparative Literature,
Queens College, CUNY

"POETRY, POLITICS AND TRANSLATION:
AMERICAN ISOLATION AND THE MIDDLE EAST"

Commentator: Professor Deborah Starr
Dept. of Near Eastern Studies

4:30 p.m., Thursday November 7
English Department Lounge
Goldwin Smith 258
Cornell University

Scholar, poet, critic, translator and activist Ammiel Alcalay examines the
relationship of culture to politics from the Cold War period to the present
set of crises in the Middle East, from the trial of Ezra Pound to the exile
of Black Panther party members in Algeria, from the poetry of Palestine and
Iraq to the politics of the transmission of texts, ideas and opinions. How
has it become so normal for Americans to be so isolated? Has it always been
this way? What do poetry and translation have to do with politics and the
marketplace? Alcalay will examine and discuss these and other questions in
an open forum, and read a section of his latest work, from the warring
factions, a book-length poem dedicated to Srebrenica, site of the massacre
of some 7,000 Bosnian Muslims in 1995.

alan is also a great poet in his own right and its hard to see how he can
"fit" all these (endless stream) of postings into his project   - but
certainly there is an interesting "mix"  (the "technical ones" with links
etc and numbers, interract with ones like the most recent post after his one
about the elections) and I think the one re the elections is not as good as
the one following but it (the election one)shows that alan is not just a
"dreamer" he feels very strongly if there is sometimes in his ouevre
(strange to be disussing a living poet like this! But why wait till alan is
no longer with us he up there with Pound! Wake up, we have a major poet
hereon the List [(and their are others who are posting fascinating stuff)]
(if his posts are so many I'll maybe never get to the bottom of them)) a
tendency toward pessimism; (but that feeling expressed is  real feeling
hence no problem with that) now I've felt and expressed that myself and
sometimes its to do with how one is  feeling (psychologically and physically
at the time) but by and large I think that the world IS "progressing"
(albeit its very hard to defiine progress and I have had some long
discussions harrangues re this matter (not always certain that per se we are
'progressing': after all sub specie aeternitatis maybe yes, we arent
"progressing")) : but I think if we take a pragmatic look we are overall:
this with an awareness of the stupidity of the enormous arms build up as
Patrick has pointed out and the increase in surveilance: curbing of freedoms
(the "failure" of the democrats kind  proving someone's quote of G B Shaw's
view of democracy) and the many frightening things happenning  the world is
yet progressing, I believe, (slowly) away from dictatorships (I see the
Bush-Blair regime as a kind of Super-"Nazi"-Imperialist hegemony or
"dictatorship"  that is more dangerous than any thing Hitler could have dome
up with _PRECISELY_ because they are well aware of what they want: or they
are more sophisticated in their desire to protect and maintain the ruling
classes: they know that they must "expand or die" - in fact though, and this
is the paradox and why Hitler could never win - (that both expansion and
non-expansion lead nowhere in terms of real progress) they are ultimately
doomed (as Imperialist aggressor states) but this doesnt mean that the US or
Britain are "finished" after all the people of those nations and around the
world are beginning to mobilise despite the threats and jingoism and the
Palestinians are continuing the struggle as are people in many other
countries such as Argentina and Colombia and even Nepal and so on (the
fighters in Afghanistan have diserpersed they are far from "finished"), the
Imperialist Nations are in fact "paper tigers" and the huge military power
is useless against the ulltimate drive for people toward a true democracy: a
world in which the people actually control the means of production: a
cooperative world, a more humaine world, and ultimately, possibly, very
likely, a world where war is no more: but not thus a "perfect world" with no
suffering or risk that is the stuff of mad dreams....

As to the danger of war etc the US and the British have by and large won
very few as time has gone by since the Second World War and their power in
the Bush-Blair sense (or the Thatcherian-Hitlerian sense) has, despite all
the muscle flexing and the huge overkill of weapons production:  has
fundamentally proved useless: the power of US-Britain is actually on the
decline (economically as well as militarily (in fact there is a desparate
need to abandon these stupid wars or   their economies could plunge even
more into chaos).  India for example is now a power to be reckoned with,
and - lets face it: Britain versus India ..well I wouldn't bet on Britain's
chances and then there's China and what about Russia  (no pussy cat Russia,
Putin is no Mr Nice Guy (I think I prefer  Mr Hussein or Slobodin Milosovich
to a guy who can kill so many of his own people in a weak response to what
is probably a just cause by the Chechyns and the Russian people will
eventually start to see how wasteful and brutal the war against Chechnya is
(as was that against Afghanistan): especially when they realise that like
the US leaders, THEIR leaders sacrifice them for their political military
gains): Russia is still a potential ally of Iran (the US tried to buy them
out of Iran recently) and probably secretly feel (rightly one would think)
that the US and Brits having bases in Turkey, Saudi Arabia, South Korea,
Kuwait and many other places (and Israel of course is effectively another US
State whch is being used for Imperialist aims of control and power) is not a
good situation for them ....Eventually though the Impreialits a nations are
doomed in the sense of being world policemen and war mogers etc... This
doesnt mean the end of struggle or conflict but potentially the end of large
scale slaughters and eventually struggle will be for production and in the
arena of ideas and class-differences etc..none being "fatal": life is a
struggle, but it is still good.

Ultimately the Muslim-Arab countries might form a large block against the
British-US, after all the Indians must have  had a guts full of the British
in India (yes they are still there with their companies and "influence") and
I know  (from Koreans who have told me who didnt know my politics) that the
US soldiers are disliked very much in South Korea (after all Korea was
always one country until te US "failed " over there and created the division
we have now (which looks like "healing)) So Eurasia and or China will be
places maybe of great growth in the future .....

So!  Alan's pessimism - if I  am right in detecting a note of it: eventually
I see that in some years hence the US and Britain will not be impoverished
but may actually have a government that is helping other nations and people
will feel much freer to enjoy life and write poetry and we will see the end
of the militarists as we know them now.

There will be massive protests against the Bush-Blair adventurers throughout
the world and maybe a lot of suffering but the people - the greater masses
of the people (everywhere) and the more enlightened intelligentsia - will be
more vigilant and will attempt to recover the concepts of the US
Constitution and ideas of real democracy and some form of socialism - the
end of millionaires running the world: the end of corruption and large scale
exploitation of poor people everywhere.    Richard Taylor.

constitutes a "productive" posting.  For my money, it's one that instigates
an unpredictable thread and doesn't try to have the last word on a given
topic.  I don't read the poems posted to the list because they are bad and
therefore do not, as poems, fulfill the basic criteria: to provoke a
discussion that will get us someplace new.  There could be only three people
contributing to the discussion and it wouldn't matter so long as the

no, pick that rock up.  we need a national standard of poetry, a panel
that will show everyone  good poetry and **baaad** poetry... we should
have one for art... and for ...(to bad  jessie has left the gallery),
but that's another story...

yes, more rocks... more judges... we should come up with a poetry test,
a sonnet (traditional - nothing modern) in say . . . 15 minutes, yes?
that should do it. and books like the diagnostic and poetic manual IV
(updated).  we will have state tests, create schools, give degrees,
institute  whole program, maybe even start a television series,  have a
spin offs, poetry barbie and poetry ken, the poetry reader for little
boyz and girlz...

and if you do not get into the program - NONONONO pOOeeetrrry......~!!!!

we could also do that with englsih, painting, history, colonialism.
imperialism, heterosexxxu(all), whiteness, normal... yes a program on
normal - a Ph.D. in normalism. I truly think we're on to something here

yes... the rock idea is a good start..I mean hear in amerika... made in
amerika . . .we get to be the judge of the world...right.

repeat after me... the rain in spain falls mainly on the plan, by gosh
I think you got it!!

Far  by C. S. Giscombe


Inland suffers its foxes: full-moon fox, far-flung fox--flung him yonder! went
the story--,fox worn like a weasel round the neck, foxes are a simple fact,
widespread and local and observable. Vulpes fulva, the common predator,
varying
in actual color from red to black to rust to tawny brown, pale only in the
headlights.


It's that this far inland the appearance of a fox is more reference than
metaphor. Or the appearance a demonstration. Sudden appearance, big like an
impulse; or the watcher gains a gradual awareness--in the field, taking shape
and, finally, familiar. The line of sight's fairly clear leaving imagination
little to supply. It's a fact to remember, though, seeing the fox and where
or,
at night, hearing foxes (and where). The fox appearing, coming into view,
as if
to meet the speaker.


Push comes to shove. Mistah Fox arriving avec luggage, sans luggage.

Virginia: Murderess and Pinstripes

All in all, it is a simple reverberation, really. Parse it from the =
start it really grips, truer than fiction realer than the one that =
washes whitest, the black stars. And all of them in pinstripes and white =
shirts. The crown jewels preferred over the rocks, the royal upstart =
parts and pauses for an exit. And all of this on the beaches, which is =
where they fought them, now the battle is won, or lost. Depending on =
perspective. And from when did ever really matter. The sun rises and =
slings into:=20

Murder in the First Degree. What? The second or third wasn't good =
enough?=20

But we are looking for collaboration. Evidence is nothing without that. =
And all rise for the judge, all rise. Even the sun rises and then the =
earth moves. Just never examine the murderess crossly. It really would =
not do. Would not do.

After that doesn't matter too busy weaving the rich tapestry to see =
writing on the wall and the days numbered?=20

The daze of the weary, the weary and working. Never met a murderer in =
pinstripes which did not grip her and/or call her friend. The mob. The =
mob. The moll. A man is only a man, but a good cigar is a smoke. And her =
weapon concealed, disguised as a violin of syllables. A violin which is =
an automatic pen. Put that under your chin and drag the bow, slowly and =
tell me that isn't a real reel. Then, the Untouchables. Oh, touch her =
not. She has got an automatic. Pen. In gents natty suiting. The cloth =
they have woven!

And carries a little Berretta or a Forty five calibre pun, son.

More than half the story in the listening depending on which version you =
saw and or passed down breaking the omerta. The listening is more than a =
vow and or contract. The listening, the heard. And would limit this =
themselves, overhearing is hearing? Overhearing a word? Or a series of =
passages?=20

Much harder to hear individual letters, let alone a whole word. She saw =
that sometimes it was also hard to see the individuals. So busy =
disguising themselves. As judges in robes. In robes. Survived the third =
degree and pled the fifth. Just pled the fifth.

Pinstripes and murder and call it seventh heaven. The orchids grown on =
the roof are extra. And so delicate.

Harry, a group think is firmly in place, of course, but what is left and what is right? was Stalin  the Left? was Hitler, a student of Lenin/Stalin tactics, on the right? can somebody explain to me what those terms mean now/used to me before?        is it about more/less democracy or something  else?
is it about attitude toward a misunderstood or discredited 19 century philosopher? is Mr. Baraka's nutty anti-israelism a form of anti-semitism or another sign of a paranoid fringe mentality?

in this country, all i can see is  Republican party, and wanna-be-a-moderate-Republican party. the second, of course, deserved to lose, because who in the world needs a second republican party? shouldn't  there be other options?

I've found this poem by Gary Snyder rather pertinent
these days:

Smokey the Bear Sutra

Once in the Jurassic about 150 million years ago,
the Great Sun Buddha in this corner of the Infinite
Void gave a Discourse to all the assembled elements
and energies: to the standing beings, the walking
beings,
the flying beings, and the sitting beings -- even
grasses,
to the number of thirteen billion, each one born from
a
seed, assembled there: a Discourse concerning
Enlightenment on the planet Earth.

"In some future time, there will be a continent called
America. It will have great centers of power called
such as Pyramid Lake, Walden Pond, Mt. Rainier, Big
Sur,
Everglades, and so forth; and powerful nerves and
channels
such as Columbia River, Mississippi River, and Grand
Canyon
The human race in that era will get into troubles all
over
its head, and practically wreck everything in spite of
its own strong intelligent Buddha-nature."

"The twisting strata of the great mountains and the
pulsings
of volcanoes are my love burning deep in the earth.
My obstinate compassion is schist and basalt and
granite, to be mountains, to bring down the rain. In
that
future American Era I shall enter a new form; to cure
the world of loveless knowledge that seeks with blind
hunger:
and mindless rage eating food that will not fill it."

And he showed himself in his true form of

  SMOKEY THE BEAR

  a.. A handsome smokey-colored brown bear standing on
his hind legs,
showing that he is aroused and
  watchful.

  b.. Bearing in his right paw the Shovel that digs to
the truth
beneath
appearances; cuts the roots of useless
  attach- ments, and flings damp sand on the fires of
greed and war;

  c.. His left paw in the Mudra of Comradely Display
-- indicating that
all
creatures have the full right to live to
  their limits and that deer, rabbits, chipmunks,
snakes, dandelions,
and
lizards all grow in the realm of the
  Dharma;

  d.. Wearing the blue work overalls symbolic of
slaves and laborers,
the
countless men oppressed by a
  civilization that claims to save but often destroys;

  e.. Wearing the broad-brimmed hat of the West,
symbolic of the forces
that
guard the Wilderness, which is the
  Natural State of the Dharma and the True Path of man
on earth: all
true
paths lead through mountains --

  f.. With a halo of smoke and flame behind, the
forest fires of the
kali-yuga, fires caused by the stupidity of
  those who think things can be gained and lost
whereas in truth all is
contained vast and free in the Blue Sky
  and Green Earth of One Mind;

  g.. Round-bellied to show his kind nature and that
the great earth
has
food enough for everyone who loves her
  and trusts her;

  h.. Trampling underfoot wasteful freeways and
needless suburbs;
smashing
the worms of capitalism and
  totalitarianism;

  i.. Indicating the Task: his followers, becoming
free of cars,
houses,
canned foods, universities, and shoes;
  master the Three Mysteries of their own Body,
Speech, and Mind; and
fearlessly chop down the rotten
  trees and prune out the sick limbs of this country
America and then
burn
the leftover trash.

Wrathful but Calm. Austere but Comic. Smokey the Bear
will
Illuminate those who would help him; but for those who
would hinder or
slander him,

  HE WILL PUT THEM OUT.

Thus his great Mantra:

  Namah samanta vajranam chanda maharoshana
  Sphataya hum traks ham nam

  "I DEDICATE MYSELF TO THE UNIVERSAL DIAMOND
  BE THIS RAGING FURY DESTROYED"

And he will protect those who love woods and rivers,
Gods and animals, hobos and madmen, prisoners and sick
people, musicians, playful women, and hopeful
children:

And if anyone is threatened by advertising, air
pollution, television,
or the police, they should chant SMOKEY THE BEAR'S WAR
SPELL:

  DROWN THEIR BUTTS
  CRUSH THEIR BUTTS
  DROWN THEIR BUTTS
  CRUSH THEIR BUTTS

And SMOKEY THE BEAR will surely appear to put the
enemy out
with his vajra-shovel.

  a.. Now those who recite this Sutra and then try to
put it in
practice
willl accumulate merit as countless as the
  sands of Arizona and Nevada.

  b.. Will help save the planet Earth from total oil
slick.

  c.. Will enter the age of harmony of man and nature.

  d.. Will win the tender love and caresses of men,
women, and beasts.

  e.. Will always have ripe blackberries to eat and a
sunny spot under
a
pine tree to sit at.

  f.. AND IN THE END WILL WIN HIGHEST PERFECT
ENLIGHTENMENT.

  thus have we heard.

We will not win with hope.

We will win only with money and brave leadership.  Not with any rhetoric of
hope or any moral upper hand.  We've had the moral upper hand for years, but
morality itself, morality devoid of zeal, and morality devoid of material
support, seems ever increasingly the domain of losers--our domain.  Not with
those who merely have the courage to sound like a good guy, but with those
who have the courage to put their own reputations and personal safety on the
line every day to do the right thing while also getting more money to do
more of the right things.  Like Cynthia McKinney.  Like Paul Wellstone.

This is not the time to stroke people's egos and tell them to cheer up.  A
line has been drawn in the sand.  Our nation and our own personal safety is
in jeopardy, in jeopardy and on the other side of the line.  Now is the time
to do what it takes, do exactly and only what it takes, and not spend our
precious energy dressing up our needs in evening gowns and pretending this
struggle is the senior prom.

I'm not talking about my $25.  Let's get people with big bucks.  Who's
dumping all of these billions into universities?  They aren't all a bunch of
retrograde Neanderthal oilmen, despite what campaign finance may look like
from the outside.  The Democratic party was once powerful because it was led
by people wealthy and intelligent enough to be able to afford generosity and
other humanitarian ideals.  The DNC went the Republican Way(TM) in the 1980s
and all of that power and identity was lost, and so too was all that money.
It's still out there, just waiting to be commanded.

Let me repeat: we will win only with money and brave leadership.  We have
neither.

Keep up the money part.  Reinforce the bravery.  What can we do to be brave?
I know: we can be frank, direct, full of integrity, and willing to do
everything it takes to stop this madness.  Let us be brave and not worry
about who our friends are.  Look at McCain: for whatever he stands for, that
guy is a leader.  He's telling it like he sees it, even perhaps to the
expense of his own party.

Foremost, we must cut this "light a candle" bullshit.  Yes, I said, it:
bullshit.  Now is not the time for such fluff.  It alienates more people
than it engages.  We need to lead by following our own moral compasses and
helping others wipe the dust from them.  We need a new political language.
One that engages people directly.  One that is aggressive.  One that
unambiguously demonstrates our confidence and courage in our convictions.

Why aggressive?  Aren't we liberals supposed to be gentle, kind, patient?
No, I say, no.  NO.  Let us face this glaring fact: for some reason the
people in America, those who are allowed to vote legitimately at least, seem
to think what they need is more of Bush and his cadre of neo-Nazis and
dime-store hustlers in expensive suits.  The people are wrong.  We the
people of America are WRONG.  Dead wrong.  Dead wrong?  DEAD wrong.

We need to face up to the fact that the voting majority is wrong.  The
majority needs to be educated.  The people need to be confronted,
questioned, harassed, and shocked into recognizing that such shocks are
nowhere near as bad as the shocks in store for them in the next two years.
They must be shaken, but not with violence--with our vision, our words, our
actions.  They must realize that those who call themselves "moderates" or
"conservatives" in the Republican party are absurdly radical.  We must do
the work of Rush Limbaugh, but deliver such zeal with the truth, and not
with Rush's surly and flaccid lies.  We must do the work of George Bush and
pound the podium, but not pound the podium so that our pals like Kenneth Lay
will line their pockets with gold.    We must pound the podium with zeal and
yell for what is righteous.  And yell loud and clear with the full knowledge
of conviction.  We must embody what is righteous, and people will follow.
If we do not, the Republicans will surely shake the majority to its knees,
and the people will run straight to those who have shaken them for some
more.  And more of that shaking will occur.  It is only in this way that we
can reinvigorate and rebuild our constituency: from the ground up, with
courage, conviction, and money.

America, if it survives, will be looted, wounded, and full of fear.  What is
to come?  A rise in national debt.  An increase of terrorist attacks.  A
much larger secret police.  More and more violations of our inherent
freedoms.  Growing prisons.  More war.  Economic collapse.  The looting of
Social Security.  Unemployment.  Rise in poverty and homelessness.
Minorities prevented more and more from voting.  Destruction of the public
education system.  A loss of international good will.  Tax cuts for the
wealthy 5%.  Energy crises.  More election fraud and unauditable electronic
election systems.  Kickbacks for the rich and pork, pork, pork.  More war on
drugs, more kids dead or in jail.  The vanishing of the middle class.  More
kids shooting each other in schools.

Is this the vision of America that we want?  Do we merely stand around and
hope that this doesn't happen and write $25 checks to some nice people who
promise us hope?  Where are the real patriots when people like George Bush
blaspheme this great nation with imitations of patriotism?  What does it
mean to be free?

The bodies are piling up and the ghosts are marching towards us.  My only
place for hope at this dark moment: I hope to God, to a God who I hope has
not abandoned us, that it is not too late.

For whatever it is worth.  And it is worth.  Everything.

Dear MoveOn member,

Yesterday's loss was devastating.  We truly face dark times.

The light in this darkness is you, and the tens of millions of
people like you, across the nation and around the world, who
will stand for a vision of hope, and not be blinded by the
politics of fear.

With Paul Wellstone's recent death, we've all been thinking
a lot about heroes.  What defines a hero?  And when do you know
that someone is a hero?

To stand up when it's darkest and continue the fight.  That's
heroism.  To fight against the odds, for something that matters.
That's heroism.  To step forward, when the rest of humanity
seems to be in retreat.  That's heroism.

You are heroes.

And when you step forward, you will not be alone.

We will be there, with you.

Three weeks ago, we honored four heroes, who stepped forward when
much of Congress was in retreat -- Paul Wellstone, Rush
Holt, Jay Inslee, and Rick Larsen.  You came forward for these
heroes with a tremendous outpouring of support -- thousands of
volunteers and more than one million dollars in contributions.
Holt, Inslee and Larsen all won their races yesterday.  And
of course, we all know Paul Wellstone would have won.

In the end, we will win.

We will win by rebuilding a new political will founded on
vision that goes beyond the tactics of fund raising and
triangulation.  We will win by projecting a vision of hope
for our country and the world that is too compelling to deny.
We will win by supporting exciting new leaders on a
political landscape filled with dinosaurs.

Bush will try to position our loss as his mandate.  But
remember one thing: less than 20% of the American electorate
voted for GOP candidates.  Nearly as many voted against, and
far more stayed home.  There is no mandate.

With your help, we will fight the coming onslaught.

We will support heroes in the House, like Minority Whip
Nancy Pelosi, who led an overwhelming majority of House
Democrats to oppose the Iraq war resolution.  We will support
heroes in the Senate, like Senator Robert Byrd, whose eloquence
brought us to tears in the Senate debate on Iraq.

It's time to make a fresh start.  We will demand quality
leadership in these difficult times.  The Democratic party must
find its voice, represent its members, and promote the broad
interests of the American public.  We will accept no less.

Thanks for everything you've done.

We stand together, with you,

- Wes, Joan, Carrie, Peter, Doug, and Eli

Ravi -

If I can chime in, I think this is an excellent question.  For many
intelligent teenagers and early 20-somethings, Cummings is the path to
intelligent poetry.  The people reading him aren't usually trained licensed
professional poets.  So it's interesting to read Cummings and see how he
achieves such a broad audience while employing a quasi-projective verse way
to form in his poems.

I would say why he's successful: 1) he writes with an incredible ear for the
melodies of nursery rhymes.  Those melodies perhaps seem childish to those
who deem themselves too sophisticated for such "juvenilia."  So, shall we
call this, a musical innocence about his poetry?  (I forget which poem of
Cummings it was, but I read it at a wedding of a friend of mine.  And I
really sang it to "Pop goes the weasel" which really flipped some lids.
Some laughter, some shock, some confusion.  Which I think is essential to
its success: its confusion.
2) That musical innocence runs head-long into very readable and
understandable conflicts about losing innocence.  even frankness about sex.
Perhaps this is the continued appeal of Cummings to young college students:
he is a sort of voice for their own paths of reckoning, of becoming, of
shedding innocence.  (Here is perhaps the other wing of the confusion.)
Cummings provides an articulation for these kids.  And it's not just limited
to the kids, of course.

And yes, I'd say that Cummings' accessibility to non-poets, particularly to
young naive undergraduates, makes him the immediate object of rejection if
not scorn among more "serious" poets.  Professors and workshop leaders have
to be more intelligent and cultivated than their students, after all.  I am
not suggesting I am above such high-mindedness myself, and have found myself
skeptical of Cummings' facility with melody.  Sometimes it just feels so
damn cute, when for me, well, I sometimes feel poetry should be dark and
weighty, like an oak mantelpiece worn on the shoulders.

Maybe Cummings' facility with language and music and clarity and simplicity
is received as something facile.

But how can this guy be so summarily ignored by "serious" gard-ee poets?  "i
sing of Olaf" is a remarkable achievement.  so too is "plato told."  perhaps
it is the love-poem impulse that drives the poets away.  sentimentality and
sincerity cannot avoid cliche, and I think cummings would rather sacrifice
originality in favor of sincerity; he risks cliche.  Which is of course
quite a risk in such a serious and high-minded pursuit as poetry.  or maybe
it's the word-play, which might seem childish to many.

Just some cursory thots...

Subject: Canonocity?

The post-canon canon was firing a few days ago when I
was re-reading E.E. Cummings' 50 poems and I began to
wonder about his legacy. He's never been quite
embraced by the avant-garde, the langpos, the new
lyricists or any collective whose production of work
is dependent, however tangentially, on some of
Cummings' innovations.

Looking back through 50 Poems, which I hadn't read in
years, I felt the incredulity of a tourist stepping
from the dark of the train station into mid-afternoon
Venice: retro-cascades of typescript, porticoes of
blank spaces, uncoupled parenthesis. A
once-new-and-now-very-old-seeming land built from
syntax up.

Sometimes, it's true, the garbled typography is simply
annoying, or at best, something dated, a curiosity
like the Cadillac, designed in the fifties with fins
and rocket lights intended to convey a futuristic
design but appearing to us, retrospectively, as a
quirky miscalculation.

But other poems, such as "Somewhere I have never
travelled, gladly beyond," seem the work of a severely
mentholated Elizabethan and are succesful as such. And
I was struck anew with the materiality of his poems,
the reliance on shape that seems a precursor to some
forms of concrete poetry, and I wonder why Cummings'
is so often ignored by those who, it would seem,
derive parts of their thematic flourish from his
explorations. Is it because his lyric content, so
laden with abstractions, is as normative and contrived
as his syntax is radical? Is it because he became a
"popular" poet and there's great antipathy and
suspicion cast on such status? Is it because he
overproduced, watering down true innovation with a sea
of replicas?

I'm curious what others think of Cummings and how his
reputation now rates...

Culture shock: City poised for radical new partnership with arts community

by Mary Jo Palumbo
Sunday, November 3, 2002

In a city that has not built a new museum or theater in almost a century,
big plans are afoot.

And for the first time in Boston Redevelopment Authority's 45-year history,
an arts leader oversees these plans.

The June appointment of Susan Hartnett as director of economic development,
one of three division heads under BRA director Mark Maloney, couldn't come
at a more significant time.

Hartnett joins the agency just as a city long criticized for failing to
support its arts institutions takes strides to address serious cultural
issues - the lack of midsize performance spaces and the loss of housing and
studio spaces for artists.

``Many good ideas have been floated in the past, but we are starting to see
real projects moving forward into implementation,'' Hartnett said. ``If we
stay on this track, the landscape of facilities for the city of Boston will
be radically changed over the next few years.''

Hartnett, 47, led the Boston Center for the Arts for 10 years before joining
the BRA. She also has a master's degree in public administration from the
Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University.

Her appointment signals the city's acknowledgment that culture is as
significant to its fiscal health as finance, education, biotechnology and
health care.

``We felt this was an enormous economic sector that needed to be
understood,'' Maloney said.

The move also suggests Boston is getting behind a strategy that other cities
have used successfully for years - linking real estate developments and
cultural organizations to increase the appeal of new projects and provide
sustained revenue for arts groups.

``Two years ago, there was an episodic commitment to the arts,'' Hartnett
said. ``We want a sustained commitment now. Right now there are projects on
the drawing board in every neighborhood of the city.''

But steering these large-scale projects to completion in the face of a
decimated state budget and a flagging economy will be no easy task.

The Museum of Fine Arts is embarking on a massive $425 million expansion.
The long-stalled renovation of the historic Opera House is expected to begin
before the end of the year. The planned Institute of Contemporary Art on the
waterfront includes a new theater as well as galleries for art.

New theaters are under construction at the Boston Center for the Arts and in
an 11-story complex behind the Emerson Majestic Theater. Plans are also in
the works to turn the Paramount Theater on Washington Street into a
performance center for a coalition of 10 nonprofit arts groups.

And hundreds of new units for art studios and housing are being planned in
neighborhoods throughout the city.

Hartnett landed the BRA post in large part because of her work linking the
arts and real estate development at the BCA. The city-owned arts center
sustains itself primarily through rent from tenants, including the Boston
Ballet, Hamersley's Bistro and the Community Music Center of Boston.

During Hartnett's tenure, attendance and budgets more than doubled. A
development deal with the Druker Co. will yield two new theaters for the BCA
by 2004. Partnerships between real estate developers and nonprofit arts
groups have succeeded in much larger ventures in other cities - for example,
Playhouse Square in Cleveland and the Denver Center for the Performing Arts.

Since Hartnett first joined the BRA as a consultant in January 2001, the BRA
has taken steps toward similar partnerships in artist housing.

It took artists 30 years to establish the first 300 units of permanent
artist housing in several buildings in the Fort Point Channel, the Fenway
and the South End. During the next three years, the city expects to double
its stock of permanent artist live/work space with 300 new units in
neighborhoods including Jamaica Plain, Dorchester, East Boston,
Allston/Brighton, Roxbury, Mattapan, Mission Hill and the South End.
Developers receive tax incentives for providing these units.

``This is a pretty dramatic turnaround,'' Hartnett said. ``With a new focus
and energy, we can do in three years what it took 30 to do in the past.''

The BRA connects artists and developers, provides financing for projects,
steers them through the permitting process and approves design
specifications.

Artists must be certified with the BRA to be eligible for live/work spaces
in projects like these:


1. An artist housing project in three brick warehouse buildings on Midway
Street in Fort Point is expected to yield more than 90 artist live/work
spaces as well as galleries, rehearsal and theater space and offices for
arts groups. The project is being developed by the Fort Point Cultural
Coalition, Inc., a newly formed nonprofit.


2. Plans are in the works to create a large new multibuilding development in
the South End with more than 50 units of artist housing and gallery and
performance space.


3. Construction is almost complete on more than 40 artist studios in a
former dry-cleaning factory on Humphrey Street in Upham's Corner.


4. A new home for the nonprofit Artists for Humanity in Fort Point Channel,
scheduled to open next summer, includes 22,000 square feet for artist
housing, galleries, education and arts-related businesses.


5. More than a dozen artist live/work spaces are ready for occupancy in a
refinished historic property called Baker Lofts at the former Walter Baker
chocolate factory administration building in Dorchester. The development
includes an art gallery and community space.


6. The recently completed Wilkes Passage complex, a seven-story residential
development replacing the old Hub Motors site at the corner of Washington
and Waltham streets in the South End, includes nine units of artist housing.


7. ``Clippership,'' a commercial development planned for a vacant waterfront
parcel on Marginal Street in East Boston, has designated eight spaces for
artists.


8. Nuestra Community Development Corp. is renovating the Dartmouth Hotel in
Roxbury's Dudley Square as a residential complex. Construction on the
project, which includes six units for artists, is expected to be completed
by January 2004.


9. Artists in Allston/Brighton and Hyde Park are working with community
development corporations in these neighborhoods to develop artist live/work
spaces in new residential developments.


To further these plans, the BRA will soon hire a senior project manager to
oversee the development of cultural facilities and artist housing.

Plans for new cultural spaces have had a poor track record in Boston. For
more than two decades, the Institute of Contemporary Art tried to build a
new home. Elaborate plans to create a midtown cultural district with
theaters, galleries, museums and public art in the mid-1980s collapsed in
the early 1990s.

But building Boston's arts infrastructure for the 21st century is a renewed
priority, Maloney said. He emphasizes a notion arts leaders have been
reiterating for years - that cultural spaces generate revenue.

``There are issues with the economy but they are not going to stop us,''
Maloney said.

``People will come to understand that the cultural community is intrinsic to
our economic strength and helps support other economic sectors,'' he said.
``The arts community will become recognized as a mainstay of our success
instead of just a celebration of our success.''

Yes, Patrick, has it here: not "hope", "will". No candles in the breeze, but
Votech. Never -- since the C.W. has the country been so divided. Never has
such a nasty nail of knowledge been driven so deep -- its violence will be
manifest for years, decades unless there's will otherwise, not hope.

I too was concerned with the outcome of the Nov 5 election. I don't speak
often or eloquently about things political, but this sentence of Patrick
Herron's got me thinking:

"Let me repeat: we will win only with money and brave leadership.  We have
neither."

~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~

Yes and no, Patrick.  If the Missouri Senate race is a microcosm--

Money:  Jean Carnahan had nearly 11 million to spend and Jim Talent had
less than 7.   Carnahan had the cities (KC and St. Louis) in the bag, but
even 11 mil couldn't buy a turnout large enough in the cities to push her
over the top.  I got a lot of ugly color brochures in the mail from NARAL
and Planned Parenthood telling me that "a woman's right to choose is on the
endangered species list"-- a terribly confusing metaphor, and an
overlapping of two planks that aren't of supreme interest to MO voters
anyway -- and of course, a big photo of Mrs C.

Brave leadership:  1. Bush stumped for Talent with unprecedented zeal,
while Bill Clinton left everyone in the state a voicemail saying "something
something Jean Carnahan something" -- on my voicemail it began mid-blather
and ended before the end.  This is the voice that said something depended
on what the meaning of "is" is.  We also got a call from Gore.  2. Talent
projected an image of someone who knew what he was talking about, while
Carnahan stumbled over words; in the first debate she answered a question
about stem cell research with an obviously canned speech about *cloning*.
She wasn't ready.

What's wrong with the democratic party? It's not a lack of resources or
even social influence.  It's that the democratic ideology has become so
politicized that it's not clear how to spend those resources, making "brave
leadership" all but impossible.  There isn't a clear enough ideological
starting point.  Democrats want to improve public education without
systematically rethinking it; people who have been a student or teacher in
a public school, especially in an urban setting, know that more is needed
than money and teachers. Democrats want to collect money for a vast array
of federally controlled social programs, despite the fact that Americans
have distrusted Federal budgeting and management for decades (the old $2000
ashtray principle). Democrats want the gov't to support art, despite the
fact that Joe Farmer/ Jane Small Business Owner doesn't give a shit--- in
fact, Joe and Jane would like nothing better than for the gov't to collect
as little $$ as it takes to ensure that they can carry on business as usual
and raise their families in peaceful cities and towns.  Democrats defend
the "right to choose" abortion as a basic constitutional right, but I think
many people are suspicious that an unborn body might be that a person after
all--what with the hair, fingernails, eyes, tongue, active brain, beating
heart-- and Democratic party is not inclined to address this concern (as
former Democrat Norm Coleman said "Being pro-life in the Democratic party
is akin to having leprosy").  Democrats didn't even want welfare reform,
which was obviously necessary even to the people on welfare.  Democrats try
to appeal to the center, but perhaps there is no viable center.
Clinton/Gore projected a profound sense of duplicity and weakness.
Gephart's decision today has only reinforced that.  There is no core
agenda, and there are no leaders.

For the Republican party, it's relatively simple: if someone hits you,
especially with four of your own passenger jets, you *hit them back*. And
you hold your ground.  If you have a business, we support that, because
you'll hire people, and people need to be hired.  If you want to pray in a
public place, we'll defend that, because you have the right to practice
your religion.  Republicans embrace a neo-Jeffersonian enlightened
individualism, which is the foundation of the democratic idea, promising to
protect each individual citizen's rights: life, libery, and pursuit of
happiness.  In all, the GOP seem to be more realistic about how the world
works.  They may be going in an unpleasant direction, but they're leading.

I'm not saying I agree with all of the above-- I'm merely pointing out that
I think the Dem ideology is hard for common people to understand.  By
contrast, the Green party seems to have much more integrity.  As does the
Republican.  Maybe the sixties are over?

I wish the electorate could speak for itself in some way other than through
voting binaries.

Virginia: False, numb and Blares



False, numb and in a predicated blare, the doctors say

all calm and profoundly comfortable.



Quite a combination=20

if one gets it right when=20

one doesn't, one doesn't.



Elicits ironic functions, does her level best. Sometimes=20

the pavement rings with function and/or irony.



And wastes days. If not

for free than for no other

alchemy. Just to be free



Or otherwise remote and contradictory. And the

narrative part is never over but under the weather



False, numb and in a predicated blare, the doctors say

all calm and profoundly comfortable.



But sets aside the limitations

the fissures not so much incipient

as crevices never so strong before.



The mossy sward was the beginning

if not the middle or the end of another chapter

and no one reads Genesis anymore.=20



It's more like and/or will be Armegeddon.=20



Angels take off and put back on hired wings.

Ah, but to find another spitter, spitting in the

clouds of opportunity. Why did it have to be him



is not the question and/or Why me? Why him?

The Cheryl Shrill me Tiginus, the Brits with Spears.

The sword carriers carried her.=20



And the best line ever written?

Here's the keronsene, ma.=20

                    Never mind the Pasha or the dusty mist.




False, numb and in a predicated blare, the doctors say

The north not north

And the magenta in

Antarctica? Clouds

not north &/or south.

Aaron--terrific post!--I agree completely that a message oriented around the
individual, in America, will always be easier to sell than one oriented around
the collective:  Americans (certainly contemporary American undergraduates) are
DEEPLY suspicious of ideas like "social forces"--they believe their
individuality is ontologically real, that they actually inhabit the vaccum of
classically liberal economic theory, exist as individual choice-making actors,
and that they have agency, their failures are their own [even as they don't
necessarily embrace more mediated forms of agency like voting].....remember
that article by David Brooks I think it was, in _Harper's_, where he goes
from "Blue" to "Red" America making condescending observations?  The point I
thought interesting was his argument against class, the (quite possibly
ficitious) absense of class rage among the lower-middle-class folks he observed
(who presumably identified themselves as "middle class" like what? 90% of all
Americans choose to do):  if we can't mobilize people who aren't actually
hungry against the fact that the top 1% have become a whole order of magnitude
richer in a generation (see that Krugman article that Joe Amato mentioned),
then what are we gonna do?  Because those who are still poorer feel
disenfranchised not by one party but by the system as a whole.

Teaching Adrienne Rich, at the moment, can feel useful.....

As the U.S. continues to insulate itself from the rest of the world, the rest
of the world continues to confront globalization.  Though not reported in the
U.S. press, yet another mass protest was staged in Quito, Ecuador last week.  I
had the opportunity to be there and write this piece leading up to it:

Here here!!  Igor's right on the money re: cummings' virtues.  There can't,
of course, be a poet just like cummings today.  Such idiosyncratic writing

xeroxes.  He no doubt means that there is no one around today who so
successfully combines formal innovation with emotional accessibility.
Actually, I think Ashbery manages to accomplish this and, like cummings,
requires that the reader read and reread and rereread to locate ALL of the
emotional jolt.  Maybe I'm wrong.  In any case, two brilliant constellations
to be sure.  Best, Bill

apropos of patrick leadership issue, this a pitch for Rep. Nancy Pelosi
(D-CA) as House Minority Leader now that Gephardt right wing democrat is
gone. Get a load of Rep. Martin Frost (D-TX) who told the NYTimes today
dems shd move further to the right. Gee that's the same thing Rush

Subject:      cat viewed from behind
Mime-Version: 1.0

I have given many pills to cats rectally. No one who is thinking hard would
really consider giving a cat a pill orally. Any medicine thought necessary
to put in a cat's mouth can just as easily go in the other end. The anus of
a cat is generally the perfect size for a pill. What's more, anything that
goes in that way is very difficult to take out. Not even the cat can get
something out of there once it's been put in. Here is a map you might need
to locate your cat's anus:


                      I I I I
                  -I-        /_

I'm with Pierre, it's how you blog. Diary or journal doesn't work for me.
Commentary can. There should be commentary, blogit, opening new rhetorical
channels across inertial listspaces and their perched snolly-gosters.

Sometimes there's a stylistic feint to difference a blog only exaggerates,
however. For instance: Ron's and then Brian's recent entries on American
speech rhythms and non-US English-language poetries. Their opinions actually
complement each other -- the one self-critical, focused on limits (US
based), the other expansive, agglomerative (non-US based). That's Ron.
That's Brian. That's Ron and Brian? Uh, no. That's blogs.

What is this, a Howard Jones remix album?

It sounds as though the blog is being cast in Bakhtinian terms as a
monologic (a nerdy prose lyric); I gotta disagree. Every blog I've
seen/written has sounded more like a transcript from the floor of a poetic
congress. Whereas! every listserv post sounds like a call in to an absent
radio host. There's at least a hope for some kind of concentration of
effort and thought with the blog -- the response model on a listserv is to
ignore ignore ignore, or snipe at a tangential point. (OK worst case
model.)

I have always thought "one" meant "life" in this context.  So it's an
apparently nice thing to say, with an undercurrent of sadness and possibly
even meanness.

Sometimes when I say "Have a good one," I then whisper, "asshole."

Why do you ask?

If anyone has something to contribute to my "violence as an american
longing" quote collection, please backchannel. They should be quotes
expressing sentimentality for bygone days that were a lot more violent.



    Where's the fun, the frolicking, the fighting? Gone! Gone!

            --Mike Fink in Thomas Bangs Thorpe's "The Disgraced Scalp-Lock"


                    Britney's garbage
    What is this bitch retarded?
    Gimme back my sixteen dollars
    All I see is sissies in magazines smiling
        (Hee-hee!)
    Whatever happened to wildin out and being violent
    Whatever happened to catchin a good old-fashioned passionate
    Ass whoopin' and getting your shoes, coat, and your hat tooken??

If I cut off my right hand
how many poets would find themselves left-handed?
Pardon me, but THERE WERE ASHES IN THIS URN last I looked.
maybe George D'Gets His Quotes From A Desk Calender Instead Of The Original
Source took them to convince me of his misreading of
the Bishop of Cloyne!

- "The table I write on I say exists, that is, I see and feel it; and if I
were out of my study I should say it existed - meaning thereby that if I
were in my study I might perceive it, or that some other spirit actually
does perceive it. There was an odor, that, it was smelled; there was a
sound, that is to say, it was heard; a colr or figure, and it was perceived
by sight or touch. This is all I can understand by these and like
expressions. For as to what is said of the absolute existence of unthinking
things without any relation to their being perceived, that seems perfectly
unintelligible. Their esse is percipi, nor is it possible they should have
any existence out of the minds which perceive them." (Berkeley, Principles
of Human Knowledge)

Stranger things have happened.

My prime suspect for the theft of my starved fox ashes, yes, but
who performed the switcheroo?
How did these stodgy buffalos get here?
Who made them fit in this well-wrought urn?
Now I have to starve & burn more foxes -
it almost broke my heart the first time
(I'm really an animal lover,
but I do what's necessary).

And what am I to do with these buffalos?
Could I switch them for something else?
Am I picking up bad habits?

WEDNESDAY NOVEMBER 15 [8:00pm]
KAYA PRESS READING: JOSEY FOO, SESSHU FOSTER AND ED LIN
Josey Foo's first book of prose and poems, Endou, was published in 1996, an=
d
portions of it were included by Jamaica Kincaid in Best American Essays
1995. Inspired by "Arrival," Tomie Arai's 1996 mixed-media installation at
the Lower East Side Printshop in New York City, Tomie's Chair, her most
recent title just out from Kaya Press, is an allegory of outward and inward
movement. Foo won the Eve of St. Agnes Award in Poetry in 1995 and is a
recipient of 2001 NEA and Pennsylvania Council for the Arts Literature
Fellowships.

Kaya Press has just published Sesshu Foster's glitteringly surreal first
novel, Zenzontli, the Keeper of the House of Darkness. Lawson Fusao Inada
applauds: "Sesshu Foster startles you, surprises you, even shocks you; his
writing sparkles with new insights and images; at the same time, he engages
you in the context of continuing history and you realize you're in what
could be familiar territory: 'Ah, yes =8B how it is!'" Foster's City Terrace
Field Manual (1996) was a finalist for the PEN Center West Poetry Award and
the Passaic County Poetry Prize, and Invocation L.A.: Multicultural Urban
Poetry, which he coedited, won a 1990 American Book Award. Angry Days, his
first collection of poetry, was published in 1987.

Ed Lin's title Waylaid from Kaya is the story of a Chinese American boy who
struggles to grow up in the grip of an overcharged sexual environment. It i=
s
a story told with a Gen-X-style bleak humor that doesn't pander to
conventional notions of immigrant narrative, a switchblade in the gut to
stories of over-achievement and success in America that ignore the human
cost. Ed Lin currently lives in New York, where he is a member of the Asian
American performance troupe Peeling the Banana.

FRIDAY NOVEMBER 15 [10:30pm]
LYCAON PICTUS AND GENERATION TIME
Lycaon Pictus features the new dynamic duo of musicians Aaron Diskin and
John Morton. A two man band that "[has] a sampler that we run beats off
of...[John] plays bass guitar on some songs and keyboard on others. [Aaron]
plays keyboard and sings. We play weird little Avant-Pop songs. We're not
dance music, and we're not rock n roll. We're almost like poetry or folk
accompanied by electronic instruments or something. We will be playing slow=
,
soothing songs."

Lycaon Pictus will be followed by another duo, Generation Time, as well as =
a
reception/social, "Broken English," with DJ Brett Creshaw and other DJ's
TBA.

Not as purifying as an atomic explosion the resemblance in fact, ending =
in shape. The mushrooms purify though they do nothing for remembrance. =
And we are not a muse but staggered by the lichen. That growing there =
upon the wall which is bright, bright yellow produces a dye which is =
red. Deep red. There is always logic, begging in a circle, alongside the =
question, or circling overheard like doves, or maybe hawks, forget about =
the handsaw when you open, close and sometimes even consider the =
louvered windows of perception.

And we are not a muse, but staggered by the lichen which never is as it =
seems when you boil it down, now this is what could be meant by =
perfection. Panic amongst the fallen angels, as though it were possible =
to become. Anything. Let alone the opposition we never oppose the =
magicians. And always feels the levant much more than the ponent. The =
winds blow nothing but jasmine in between the mushrooms and it glows. =
One can very nearly hear it.

And eventually, out come the clowns or maybe the protector of the =
travellers.=20

And we are not a muse, but staggered by the lichen which never is as it =
seems and is the source of all rejuvenation and nourishment and the same =
cup of coffee looking for trouble when all is considered is really the =
fat of the land of starving foxes. A good cappuccino and acres of rough =
diamonds. Or one. Or another, like stars.

                      The People vs. Gertrude Stein

1.     WHEREBY, Party is the first part of the party of the first part. That
part of the party. The party of the first part. The part of the party is in
part the first part. Part is in part the first party.
2.     WHEREBY, Second is the first part of the second party. The second
part is the party. The party of the second party.
3.     WHEREBY, there is no third party. Because there is no third party.
4.     The party of the first part brings forth this complaint against the
second party. The party of the first part is like that. Because the party of
the second part is beside that.
5.     And with and without the second part which is and without the first
part the second part can be complained to and then and how and all around we
the party of the second part think and found that it is.
6.     To begin the complaint there is no party. There is no party in part.
The party is done. And then the spreading, that was not accomplishing that
needed complaining and yet the second party was not so difficult as not all
in place. The party of the first part had no change. They were not
respected. The party of the first part were that, they did it so much in the
matter and this showed that that settlement was not condensed. It was spread
there. Any change was in the ends of the centre. A heap was heavy. The
second party did not change.
7.     If the complaint has the place then there is distribution to the
first part. That is not natural. There is a contradiction and naturally
returning there comes to be the party of the first part and the party of the
second part and the complaint. That can be seen from the complaint.
8.     If complaining is a size that is recognised as not a size but a
piece, comparing a complaint with what is not recognised but what is used as
it is held by complaining, complaining comes to be repeated. Complaining
comes to be repeated.

9.     SUPPOSE, they are put together;
10.    SUPPOSE, that there is an interruption, that complaining again they
are not changed as to position;
11.    SUPPOSE, all this and suppose that any two parties of whom are not
complaining;
12.    SUPPOSE, that the two parties are not consumed. Is there an exchange,
is there a resemblance to the complaint which is admitted to be there and
the document which can be seen. Is there. That was a question. There was no
certainty. Filing a complaint meant that any two were indifferent and yet
they were all connecting that, they were all connecting that consideration.
This did not determine rejoining a letter.

13.     Thank you for being there. Nobody has to care.
14.     Thank you for being here. Because you are not there.

This is funny, Gary. But it's Friday and maybe it's time - if there is one
around - to get to a real party.
Well I am going to hear George Albion give the Poetry Center's George Oppen
lecture at the Unitarian Church in San Francisco. George A is promising the
company of music. And he's been practicing. A relief from a terrible
-electoral, so to speak -  week.

What is G's part in the party?

                   Barechested and

Feet first into recently Promised locations

Everyone wants to be the Next big

to be Unclean aboard Supposedly safer
                Methods of travel

headed for further Predictable tantilizings

Gems that have fallen away from their
            necklaces and Watches

and aren't distorted by Gin or
             rags dipped in gas

I say "Rip me Open" and you ask

Warm bellies that Offend or remind
us of Melodies

Trips to prison for overnights that
                      will last

Fixate on the most Alluring explosives
                     wired for surprise

Trip all the Alarms on your Way out

crude and inexperienced Designs evoking

Meditations in a Time of Delusions and Lies - 5

Defense Secretary Daniel Rumsfeld is not happy with the CIA. The
intelligence agency failed to find
clear links between Al Qaeda and Iraq. A much heralded Prague meeting
between an Al Qaeda member
and a representative from the Iraqi government turned out to be false --
although the rumor of such a
meeting no doubt aided in inflaming the Bush administration's war
hysteria. It turned out it was
Rumsfeld’s own special intelligence unit that came up with the bogus
Prague meeting, so that's not too
reassuring, and Rumsfeld is still itching to uncover more such dubious
“intelligence.” The CIA realizes
that shoddy or jimmied intelligence brings their whole business into
question -- they have certain
professional standards -- and they are naturally nervous about
Rumsfeld’s special unit. I am no fan of
the CIA, but I am less of a fan of intelligence units in the hip pockets
of individuals with distinctly
megalomaniacal tendencies.

Paul Wolfowitz, Undersecretary of Defense and the person many consider
to be the brains of the
“chicken hawks,” assures us that the new intelligence unit is merely a
corrective device and not a
rogue operation. Wolfowitz explains that there is “a phenomenon in
intelligence work [in which] people
who are pursuing a certain hypothesis will see certain facts that others
won't, and not see other facts
that others will. . . The lens through which you're looking for facts
affects what you look for” [NY Times
Oct. 24, 2002]. Kurt Campbell, a former Pentagon analyst, described
Wolfowitz’s approach more bluntly,
calling it “objective analysis -- meaning I provide the objective, you
supply the analysis” [NY Times Nov
3, 02]. Most Americans would call this “making up lies” or “manipulating
half-truths” or “twisting facts
to fit your own agenda” or . . . But, in the Bush administration, this
is called “intelligence.”

Of course, I have not yet heard William Bennett or other defenders of
Western Civilization lash out at
that Rumsfeld and Wolfowitz are dangerous radical skeptics that doubt
the existence of “truth” or are
virulent post-modernist frauds -- and I'm not holding my breath that
they will. Still, debates on exactly
how someone determines the accuracy of “facts” have swept across
scholarly work for a long time. In
the “culture wars” Bennett and others have spent a lot of time attacking
those who entertain notions
that contingency or indeterminacy or power dynamics are regular parts of
how we know reality. And now
Wolfowitz and Rumsfeld have declared that, indeed, one's worldview or
ideological framework does
affect how you perceive reality although when it happens to be their
“lens,” that representation is the
truth.

The “lens” with which we examine the world does affect how we see it, as
those who have studied the
social construction of such “natural” things as race and gender have
long noted. The Pentagon has long
seen dead civilians, put on its lens, and proceeded to regard them as
“collateral damage.” Rumsfeld
sees settlements and soldiers on the West Bank, but through his lens of
imperial support for Israeli
extremists the land is “disputed territory.” Most of the world sees the
same settlements and soldiers
through the lens of international law -- and the West Bank is “occupied
territory.”

So, what's a fact? We can argue that a long time. Many thinkers have
become suspicious about
absolute truth claims. Still, most are not in favor of anyone cooking up
facts, particularly when it
regards issues of war and peace. Espionage and military intelligence are
not social sciences, although
they may employ those techniques; they also involve cunning and other
arts, and depend a lot on luck.
Still, as the Tonkin Gulf Resolution (and the entire Vietnam War)
illustrates, intelligence reports can
be distorted or even invented to serve the interests of those in power
(or to protect their underlings).
Consequently, the fact that Rumsfeld and Wolfowitz have launched their
own “lens” or factory for
“objective analysis” should be a worry to all people, not just scholars.
In the recent past, if the CIA was
incompetent or overstepped its bounds, public opinion could have an
effect. But a private -- or
semi-private -- cloak-and-dagger operation is one more indication of the
alarming direction in which the
Bush administration is heading.

When the Emperor announces that he is in charge of the “truth,” we can
be confident that his subjects
will only be dazzled with better lies.

Here's another site that all you Babelfish fans may find useful (or
not, depending on how you feel about doing things yourself): a site
that runs any text through five different Babelfish translators
sequentially: <http://www.tashian.com/multibabel/>.

I remember reading about the amusement factor for computer
translations a long time ago (possibly the early 1970s or earlier,
certainly long before personal computers and the Internet) in a
science fiction magazine. Does anyone know what this source may have
been?

Are "digital poetry" and net art two distinct genres? And, perhaps more importantly, should they be?

Subject:      Essay on 'It is good that skinheads are in power.'
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII

Essay on 'It is good that skinheads are in power.'


It wasn't until the skinheads began going to graduate schools, that things
really began to change around here. At first there was resistance, and in
fact a lot of the early ones converted, as if they saw the 'error of their
ways.' But as more and more came in, the junior faculty and adjuncts were
affected themselves, and soon, more and more key positions were held by
this segment of the population, a fifth column of supremacists and
marauders that no longer gave credence to the idea that 'education was for
everyone.' Whatever minorities did make it in 'the hallowed walls' soon
found themselves the targets of unmitigated criticism from all sides. Some
did stay the course, and often were converted into a kind of self-hatred;
many left for 'better pastures' outside the school system altogether.

It wasn't long before the school boards of some of the nation's top states
fell under the sway of the skinheads, and education went back to the
primary values of Dick and Jane, in which the highest goal was the white
suburban street with a station wagon in every driveway. Here, they could
relax and enjoy themselves as affected by the education system, and for
the majority of the country, people agreed and found themselves quite well
off and secure for the first time. The elements who didn't belong were
taken care of in other ways, without the self-punishing rage of the
earlier skinhead movement, who were 'held up for valour' but never imitat-
ed, as there was no need for violence in this very tight American society.

There were many discussions among themselves as to the best way to do
things now that they were in their hands finally, and they decided that
everyone should have their 'head examined' as to their thinking and their
support of war-time effort that was always being made. It was a chance to
not 'spare the rod' but apply it everywhere to our conquered foes who were
waiting for a chance to participate in the 'good life.' What can I say but
I did approve of all of this because the 'liberal bad-boys' were now out
of power and we could get a good education in our fundamental values from
which the United States was carved from. It was a remarkable time and it
still is since those 'foes at bay' have nothing to gain any more by giving
in to the 'powers out there' when we offer then a first-class security and
not having to vote.

Yes this is a 'good time to give in to the skinheads who are securely
running the country and know what's best for us.' I whole-heartedly
support this conclusion which is the best thing for many people and should
be supported by everyone.

Please let me know this info or post it (email would be better).  Thanks!

I have a copy of the journal.  It has some famous folks in it and some non
famous folks and a mixture of good snd bad material (not the same mixture as
who is well-known and who isn't....).  The interesting thing about this
journal is that it PAYS: $100 per page of poetry!

Cinsequently, I intend to submit work to it, although other journals please
me more aaesthetically.  It isn't trashy or aanything, just a little uneven.
It does have a story by Diane Greco, a wab writer, which metions web art
things in the cintext of a tradutional short story, aand it haas essays ans
creaative ninfiction as well as stories and poems.  The ppay is different
for each genre and is listed in the magazine.

There is a lot of stuff on WNYC, New York's public radio stations.  They
haave a web broadcast which sounds quite good even on a 56k modem (usues the
windows maedi player and not real audio, incidentally), so yoou can hear
the prpgrams in question.  Plus they have archives you can hear.

WNYC has a show called The Next Big Thing, http://wnyc.org/shows/tnbt, which
often has poetry.  It did an entire show of Kenneth Koch's minature poetic
plays, for instance.  It is a variety show though and has other stuff too.
You'lll see from their web page a little bit what they have, but they don't
shirk from poetry and drama which is modern and plotless and experimental--
in fact most of their pieces are pretty experimental.

Another show, Studio 360 http://www.wnyc.org/studio360/ has reviews and
essays about art and musoc and sometimes poetry.  Their co-hosts are often
writers, for example Michael Cunningham who wrote The Hiours (a novel based
on Woolf's Mrs. Dalloway which is pretty cool and not derivative like most
of that kind of thing).

For ordinary conversations with writers, you can't do better than the
Leonard Lopate show http://wnyc.org/shows/lopate , which is a call-in *(the
callers ar  usually pretty erudite too, not usual am radio types).  The only
thing is that it is all genres, noit just writers.

Then there is th Joe Frank show, http://wnyc.org/shows/frank, also airing on
WNYC at 11pm on am 820 (you can listenn on the web) which is radio
drama/poetry/experimetal fiction snd narraive. It's not WNYC's show but the
web site they point to at KCRW no longer exists so I don't know what staion
powns this show.  It can get really weird...

I found some other sites from their links:

This site, Hearing Voices http://www.hearingvoices.com/ has some intereting
audio work though I didn't find poetry. It is good odd stuff though, not
ordinary reportage.

a bundle of deeds from one of the nearer outer islands. And the castle =
there has a number of tapestries. You need to cheat and look at the =
verso where the colours are true. They haven't faded from light. They =
are true, truer than tapestries themselves. Tied with ribbon and wrapped =
in layers of plastic with a note, visible through transparency: THESE =
DEEDS HAVE BEEN SUBJECTED TO A MALICIOUS URINATION. Something about one =
of the goats. Reading a bundle of deeds? Goats read? And examine title =
deeds? Even on Shapinsay, it seems highly unlikely. A malicious =
urination and the deeds were done. The bloody deeds were done. This is a =
true story, in whichever person tells it. In a way, the goat tells it, =
the giddy goat has always had a lot to say and said it clearly at the =
time. The malicious urination took place in the early 90's and the after =
effects continue and will until the transactions with that piece of land =
cease. The note is a warning to all who would examine the deeds closely =
with a view to checking out their authenticity, dates of recording, the =
whole travail of the land in question forming part of ALL and WHOLE the =
part and portion or area of ground in question. What was the question?  =
When the last Lord Lieutenant left Shapinsay, his aunt was horrified and =
warned him: you on mainland? It's a jungle, beuy. A jungle. Perhaps, but =
the goats are civilised all the same, not a malicious pisser among them, =
though admittedly some are heading towards cloven hoofed Bolshevism by =
the look of them. The best thing about them is they do not bother with =
deeds, the goats on this island. They are busy creating summer and =
mushrooms that follow in November.

DC hath made us mad. What with the prospect of dirty bombs, sniper fire and
the dreaded Young Urban P(PPY)rofessional, we're about to go crazy around
here. Or read poetry and fiction in this vein, which is a sort of attempt at
catachrestical equivalents.

See this process in action!!!!

Evil Minds @ Art-o-matic. This Sun the 10th. From 5:30-8. At the former
Waterside Mall (just outside the Waterfront stop on the Metro greenline).
There will be an open mike reading after, so bring your own writings!!!!!!!

Kate used two pumpkins for a writing exercise in the poetry workshop she
teaches and then left them with Damien and they've been in his office since,
so Patchen put them in the hall outside Damien's office with a sign on each.
  The first one says, "Don't smash this pumpkin," and the second sign says,
"Or this one, but especially not this one." So the rest of us, hearing about
it, smashed them into tiny bits. Kate still hasn't gotten over it.

There will be beer, that I'm bringing in a suitcase. And several hours of
merriment. Join us.

as predicted by Baktin, it would seem by the nature of things that it is

What is Hogerhand?

The Hogerhand People's Front is a civil defence militia. Its function is the
pre-emptive defence of the Dutch coast against a possible invasion by Armed
Forces of the United States. Notice of this invasion was given in the
so-called 'Invasion Act', which president Bush signed on august 2nd this
year.

http://www.hogerhand.nl/

Ends and Means

The concrete goal of Hogerhand is the physical defence of the International
Criminal Court, located in The Hague, The Netherlands. However, this
seemingly absurd endeavour also serves a more abstract purpose - a purpose
which reaches far beyond the beaches of Scheveningen.

Pro-active defence

The United States of America have announced that they will stage a military
raid on the International Criminal Court if US citizens should ever be sent
for trial there. This threat is not just a gross insult to The Netherlands,
as the host of the International Criminal Court. It is nothing less than a
pre-emptive strike against the very concept of international justice.
The media have tended to laugh off the announcement of an invasion. We,
however, take it extremely seriously - particularly the implicit attack on
international law. As a literal response to this absurd threat from the
United States, we have therefore decided to mobilise our own pro-active
defence militia.

***************

Someone's drawing a line in the sand.  The Dutch know what it's like to be
invaded by Nazis and they know what it takes to resist them, no matter how
futile.

THE WELL DRESSED MAN WITH A BEARD

After the final no there comes a yes
And on that yes this future world depends.
No was the night. Yes is this present sun.
If the rejected things, the things denied,
Slid over the western cataract, yet one,
One only, one thing that was firm, even
No greater than a cricket's horn, no more
Than a thought to be rehearsed all day, a speech
Of the self that must sustain itself on speech,
One thing remaining, infallible, would be
Enough. Ah! douce compagna of that thing!
Ah! douce compagna, honey in the heart,
Green in the body, out of a petty phrase,
Out of a thing believed, a thing affirmed:
The form on the pillow humming while one sleeps,
The aureole above the humming house. . .

It can never be satisfied, the mind, never.




(from The Collected Poems of Wallace Stevens)

 In case our local media - in its Bush gush-gush - "inadvertently" misses
this news:



FLORENCE, Italy -- Almost half-a-million people have taken part in a march
through Florence in what was promoted as the first Europe-wide anti-war
rally.

The demonstration is part of the European Social Forum -- a gathering of
anti-globalisation groups which is trying to decide how the movement should
progress.

Some 20 trains and hundreds of special buses began arriving in the early
hours, bringing demonstrators from across the continent.

Guy Taylor, an activist with Britain's Globalise Resistance, told Reuters:
"This is the first Europe-wide anti-war demonstration and I think it's vital
it has a real impact.

"There's such strong underlying opposition to the war that I think we can
stop it."

The protest was being held a day after the U.N. passed a resolution paving
the way for the return of weapons inspectors into Iraq. (Story)

Baghdad is required to comply with the inspectors or face "serious
consequences."

"It's a scandalous resolution," said Sean Murray, 29, a member of a group
called the Workers' Revolution.

"It proves once more that the United Nations is a puppet of America, Britain
and France and is not an institution that's there to serve the interests of
the world's people."

The march was billed as a major test for Italian police, after the death in
Genoa last year of an anti-globalisation protester during violent clashes
with police.

Fearing damage to artistic gems such as Michelangelo's David, more than
6,000 police were assigned to patrol Florence and surrounding areas during
the forum.

The European Union's Schengen Treaty -- which normally allows for no border
controls when travellers go from country to country in the 15-nation
grouping -- was also been suspended ahead of the demonstration.

The anti-globalisation movement has made headlines for demonstrations,
sometimes violent, at meetings of international bodies such as the World
Trade Organization, the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and G8.

The four-day European Social Forum is the first attempt to unite the array
of anti-globalisation movements scattered across Europe.

The decision to allow the forum to be held in Florence -- after the violence
seen in Genoa -- has resulted in weeks of debate in Italy.

This was a great lecture - lecture almost seems the wrong term. Spoken
against/with the low volume soundings of a 20th century Italian avant-garde
opera (I did not get the composer's name - No-No?), George gave a close read
to poems at different points of Oppen's career - going from original ones of
a  "thin" surface to one in which the language - the phrasings - becomes
more multiple (even opulent) in their interpretative options. The way the
language pays scrupulous attention to what is here (immediate) in the
present as free as possible from a prior rhetoric - social, religious or
otherwise.  "Brick" concreteness against the shock of sunlight. The
scrupulous attention driven by the ethical will to make accurate
decisions/choices.

(The opening of his talk made interesting distinctions between Oppen's
"objectivism" and the definitions ascribed to Pound & Co. Of which I will
not risk a paraphrase).

I am thinking off the top of the head of my  memory here. (I'd like to hear
other people's takes).  It will be great to see this lecture in printed
form. Tho one suspects (no matter typography and design) nothing will quite
match the clarity and attention of George's phrasing and consideration of
his audience. He definitely created a sacred space around the attention to
the poems and the history of Oppen's work. (Indeed the talk/performance was
delivered in a small chapel of the Unitarian Church).

Did he do his homework, as well!

Hi Jordan-


I'm not saying what they all are this, that, etc. etc.  I read Ron's blog
almost every day, for instance, and wholly endorse it.  And I agree at least
on a very anecdotal level with what you say here. the voice of the blogger
is typically more secure/authoritative than the voice of the e-list poster.

BUT BUT BUT

The but has to po(o)p out eventually...

I was speaking of potentialities and eventualities, teleologies.  And I'm
evaluating blogs and e-lists, analytically speaking, in the context of
*proximal* interactions.  In terms of intimate, phsyical, and proximal
interactions with others, blogs are at least as far if not farther/further
(we're playing here with the edges of the distinction between farther and
further) removed from such interactions as e-mail lists.  Text is a
technology that removes the intimate; the internet compounds the loss in the
lossy signal, and separates us from each other more and more, except, of
course, virtually speaking.

How many times have you heard someone say something is "virtually" x,
whatever x is, and you just wanted to boffo them with a firm pillow over de
head?  That's a simple way of reducing what I'm suggesting:
"virtual"=nothing there, nobody home.  No matter how much we want to
double-speak our way out of accepting this....


Patrick


PS I am very pleased with some of the poetry being posted to this list as of
late.  Lakey Teasdale, Jeff Harrison, Jim Behrle: keep it up.  And Gary's
People Vs. Gertrude Stein!  Hah!

PSS Hey J Gallaher: for the best use of that Highlander quote, please refer
to the film _Hands on a Hard Body_: perhaps the funniest documentary I've
ever seen.  Or maybe that is precisely what put you in the mind of that
quote.

It sounds as though the blog is being cast in Bakhtinian terms as a
monologic (a nerdy prose lyric); I gotta disagree. Every blog I've
seen/written has sounded more like a transcript from the floor of a poetic
congress. Whereas! every listserv post sounds like a call in to an absent
radio host. There's at least a hope for some kind of concentration of
effort and thought with the blog -- the response model on a listserv is to
ignore ignore ignore, or snipe at a tangential point. (OK worst case
model.)

Hi,
   I'm looking for poetry that would be suitable for male inmates of a
maximum security prison. This particular group is segregated from the general
prison population. They have IQ's of 70 or less and are imprisoned because of
sexual crimes and murder. I am looking to put together a packet of poetry
that the inhouse educator/guard might find useful. Any suggestion of
resources/poems would be appreciated.
    Thanks, backchannel is fine.

Patrick Etal.  The internet (speaking generally) like all tools or
"advances" such as televsion has great power for good: but of course it can
be maniuplated or it is manipulated for "bad"  (however these thigs are
defined: it is probably obvious that we are both linked more (I can talk to
someone in the US (and elsewhere in many oter countries) however (and here
the linguists and philosophers and sociologists etc can wade in) there is
still a sense of alienation: I "know you" yet I've never head your voice
("you" not neccesarily being "you" Patrick  (another doubling up!))...and
human social interraction needs the whole person there in front of us:
conversely I probably have talked more (if talk is the term) with writers
who I probably wouldnt have much to say to face en face: or they mightn't
have time or not wish to talk to someone such as myself: and there is
obviously atendency for myself and maybe others to say things we wouldnt
(neccessarily) dare if we were in that person's presence: some of these
problems/issues of communication are also significant in "real life"  (of
course real life also  includes Bloggs and e- Lists as well)

As to Bloggs in particular I like the idea (I dont know much about them) but
sense that people are putting too much reliance on the internet (albeit it
is also a marvellous thing...its like the paradox that televsion
thpeoretically is a great tool for  information dissemitaoin but that
information maybe 'skewed' ): so Blogs such as Sillliman's are bound to be
interesting as he is a major writer thinker (even if I disagree with some of
his politics but on a Blog of course I suppose he can "control" the politics
whether that is a consious act or not and whose to say he shouldnt or
doesnt? maybe he doesnt and chouldnt...but its seems that Bloggs can be less
"open' than eg this List)

I still havent discovered exactly why Johnston and Gould were taken off the
List: I can see why they might be excluded form certain Bloggs (I suppose
the Flat earth Society eg could have a Blogg and have as its rules that
noone suggest the earth is round).....ok I'm blowing up a match box with a
nuclear bomb  but..... there are still some unanswered questions.

Your bloggfully, Richard Blogg Taylor

I have updated http://vispo.com/misc/links.htm to feature the work of some of the French
multimedia web.artists. Links to the work of Nicolas Clauss, Antoine Schmitt, Frédéric Durieu,
Jean-Luc Lamarque and servovalve.org are at the top of the page.

All of these artists use Director/Shockwave quite prominently and are programmers. Some of them
share an interest in programming the motion of the human body or living things, more generally,
or lively, telling motion, more generally yet. Some of them share an interest in interactive
audio. Some of them share an interest in 'imaging Lingo'.

I have spent many hours enjoying their work. Many thanks to them for such stellar art on the
Web.

THE CLARA


http://www.asondheim.org/portal/clara

The economy of the special effects apparatus from the 1930s gives way to
the digital; the digital isolates those moments of the image that speak
all too easily, as if they weren't speaking at all.

The beautiful woman is isolated and framed by a device capable of addition
or subtraction of the potential screen, the imaginary, positioned. The
apparatus as in Godard displays itself, inhales/exhales the graphic-in-
residence.

This is the smallest conceivable way to waylay the wayward viewer. One
looks over the shoulder of the apparatus; hopefully the framing is still a
long way off - the result clearly one of an infinite field of the social,
of perception itself - or, in a sense, the inverse of the vanishing-point
in perspectival configurations.

(The social reveals itself, an emblem.)

Nick, as you know better than anyone, at one point Freud uses a train
metaphor to suggest how language articulates "psychic materials." Any
narrative is a train-track, he imagines, along which certain words function
as "switches" to indicate tracks not taken that lead to suppressed secondary
narratives of equal importance to the main narrative.

Nouns in the following Benjamin Friedlander poem operate like Freudian
switch-words, "jig" and "temperance" especially:

THE SOCIAL CONTRACT

We

who are about to sigh

anoint you

who sign for the drinks

when the jig is up

and lock us up

in the clink

of two

flutes of champagne

toasting the end

of a losing campaign

for temperance

Zukofsky's Century Dictionary (http://216.156.253.178/CENTURY/index.html)
cites one Hallwell who identifies the jig as "a ludicrous metrical
composition, often in rhyme, which was sung by the clown, who occasionally
danced, and was always accompanied by a tabor and pipe." There's a clowning
with history (e.g. "temperance"??) in these rhymes -- but, is that all
that's going on? When all switch-words are "opened" to reveal their other
tracks, this poem seems to become a repressed allegory of our times (and
reintroduces use of allegory itself as a means of addressing
quasi-"censored" political subjects -- here, the practice of social critique
itself).

Two narrative-tracks in this poem are the prison (one of the great figures
of contemporary privatized social-space) and the social contract (one of the
great French figures of liberal individualism). They become one as a
metaphor in the line "and lock us up." Getting locked in a neoliberal
prison, if you like, here, is the precondition for constituting the social
as such.

That first one-word line evokes a range of slogans, from Yevgeny Zamiatin's
novel, We, to "We the people." Part of the clowning that keeps the poem
going is how "we" do not sign any social contract; instead, "we" "are about
to sigh." We are collective affect, beholden to a head of reason.
Individuals sign the social contract, not groups. We sigh with relief, we
who are about to die, anoint you (as the Roman gladiators said, saluting
Ceasar). We sigh with relief. Someone else is paying for the drinks! The
person who signs the "social contract" is the person who pays -- and that
will apply to every individual one of us, insofar as we can. The "social
contract" is the bill itself, and credit-card system.

As Friedlander's book title, A Knot Is Not a Tangle (Krupskaya, 2000)
suggests, the poem presents us with a knot. There's a sense in this poem of
giving in, after a long period of holding back, and of resistance. Surely
there is a release, celebration, by poem's end. Paradoxically however, this
letting-go is not into a state of greater dissolution and free play (to jig:
"set or vibrate in a lively manner"). The "set," instead, is toward more
straitened circumstances than were previously held to be the case. The
symbolic signing of the social contract is a chastening and sobering
moment -- even as everyone sips champagne, standing awkwardly (there's no
guzzling jugs of beer!).

The jig is acknowledged by all to be up -- dance over -- at the moment when
it dawns who the new master is, whom "we" anoint in the
symbolically-official moment of a toast to the master's victory. Jig, apart
from being a country-dance, is also a "small, light mechanical contrivance."
Some kind of game is up, some sort of entertaining of an alternative social
contract than one based on who will pay the bill.

Next to jig, the last, perhaps most ambiguous word freighted with the most
repressed allegorical message, is temperance. The "temperance" campaign
ended in defeat. Whew! -- even as we are now beholden to some stricter, but
somehow more hidden, code. Temperance, whatever that switch-word may
suggest, was after all, against "human nature."

"Jig" and "temperance" both hint at a kind of contrivance for some
alternative social contract. But their allegorical import is almost entirely
suppressed in the hush of the toast – to "our" victory!

This next to the other takes on "the social" on Silliman's Blog.

Murat. Thanks. I think I was a bit confused (so confused I wrote
brilliantly!). But I think that this whole
issue of communication is something we all need to rethink (myself
included). And I dont think we can easily seaprate poetics and politics or
any discipline....Without cringing I think that we all (myself included)
have said
things we would not otherwise say: there is also the obvious thing that
facial expressions etc are absent: but of course the internet provides
"openings" for a non-academic poet such as myself or an academic poet such
as Wystan (albeit if i'm not wrong Wystan would _sometimes_ rather be
outside the academic "circle"  yet then certain advantages are possibly
lost: I dont mean financial only ...I mean such as access to libaries,
information, even input fom students and the very act of lecturing or
presenting and communicating with people in one's field): and also "openings
" for us to leap through or into gaps and across borders without physically
travelling...now Bloggs I
believe are becoming easier to make so that (at least I believe "sites" are
getting easier to set up and so on) which argues a way of subverting or
circumventing  (partly) publishing itself (Silliman doesnt neccessarily need
to as he is quite widely published, although, looking at Borders just now in
Auckland there are very few poets there like Bromige, Silliman, Piombino,
Watten, although these and Silliman and Howe and others are more likelty to
appear than the more "obscure" "post-postmodernist and post language poets
and others even writers more "normative" [ this raises the probematic of the
relativity of outsidedness or whatever and the degree of narginalisation and
so on] (of course one can order books and
more writers ("form the outside" so to speak maybe accesible): so Blogs (and
somewhat (on) this List if we include a number of writers such as Lanny
Quarles (who kindly gave me some insight into his work when I inquired into
it "back channel"), Kari Edwards, Lacook, Berhle, and Aaron Beltz and many
others) and others are a way of self-publishing (another way as well as
chapbooks) maybe  not totally satisfactory but who knows Jim Andrews,
Sondheim, Bill Austin,(and the Australian writers: sorry have blanked out on
their names - Kominos Zervos is one) and many others are doing some
extraordinarily good work with Vispo: now maybe that is (partly) "the
future" as people say, but I feel that Patrick is warning us of the problem
of alienation, of sticking our heads in
the teleological-political sands (I think I know what teleological means but
what the hell I love the word!)...

So we need to be aware of the various traps
and pitfalls, and when we do  need some ego stroking - we dont need it
much - but encouragement or aknowledgement is good - and I have always tried
to support writers I like and encourage others (after all I may not "like"
their writing but it could be "doing" something that I may come to see later
as valuable or stimulating).

I think also that although the mark has been drawn in the
conceptual-political sand, and Bush baby is off on his "High Noon" adventure
with Destiny - god bless him - l o n g  l   i   v  e  B  u sh (drn...) - and
we maybe
dont need hope we do need the possibility of a good outcome and not everyone
can be as courageous as the Senators (including the one whose plane crashed
and the woman Senator to  whom I emailed my support )....

So - I'm wandering around I know - but meantime we need to keep writing and
making and thinking and being artists: just as the Jewish people and others
in the 2nd w. war kept their culture or beliefs and customs going: think eg
of the French musician who performed a symphony (?) in a concentration camp:
now that doesnt preclude (present time) discussion, action, courage and
commitment for us now (I mean being hopeful is good: but not naive
hopefulness): now I know that the Democrats are not relevant to me as such
(being in NZ) (nor are they particularly (if at all ) left): yet the
significance of the support that Bush is getting is ominous to everyone of
any sensitivity or intelligence: this sense of alienation for many people
might be coupled with despair or fear..but contra that I can point out the
confidence that Mao Tse Tung had when talking to (the Americans) Jack Belden
(in separate books) and Edgar Snow when he calmly and confidently expressed
the inevitability of defeat of Germany and the Japanese and ultimately of
Imperialism, and this at a time when he and his forces were greatly
outnumbered it seemed): but this doesnt mean that we all breathe sighs of
relief and blogg out (although some late night and secret Blogging is
allowed according to Section 654w/7654!): nay, those of us who can need to
unite and think and very soon we can each decide how to act.  In this, in
the main, I agree with Patrick: but nor should that mean we stop writing
(witness Brecht's poetry and drama going on during the war) .

Political alertness (we are deeply alarmed by Auschwitz etc) can be coupled
with continuance: hence Bloggs may have their place (even if they are
temporary
refuges or regrouping places before the great L+A+N +G  and the human
counterattack).  Mao Tse Tung said "An army without culture is a dull-witted
army" I dont know if I am a "Maoist" I just get inspired by aspects of Mao's
ideas and his life and times and I see that (in theory at the very least)
art and politics neednt crush each other to death. In know the dangers of
"social realism" etc and certain kinds of wooden thinking: (and of the
dangers eg. of the Stalinist invasion of Hungary etc) and there is a
parallel danger of thinking that we are "doing something concrete" by
"talking" on Bloggs or the Net - we need to go out into the "real" world  as
well.

It looks as though the Right are crossing -have crossed ? - their Rubicon
and the Left are a running to catch up. Nor do we need to hold grudges about
old fights: we need unity now, and remember that people change, whether we
like the change is irrelevant we need to be aware that change is ongoing.
(eg Harry Nudel might even agree with me one day!!!)

These are dark but not hopeless times. Richard Taylor.

PS. I was discussing the langpos and politics at a party last night
commemorating the Russian revolution and my friend Scott explained to some
of the politicos there the paradox of such as David Antin's seeming total
reversal in his poetical/political thinking but I cant help but recall how
brilliant his "talk poems were/are" (even having only seen them and not
having been present at a readingof them): how powerful a weapon they could
be now for proaction against the Right

Hey Saint Jude


Lose your cause if only to Keep me

Worrying about if you're alive OR
              Just being born

I forgive all Trespasses But
                 feel the Worst among

Beastly hands and merciless mercenaries

Display yr contempt for Vanity
Presses and Arranged marriages

While traced phonecalls leave you Broken

Blessed are those chain reactions
                  that attract Foxes
                  like you

Dangling from the limbs of Willows

In yr legendary room you've seen Plenty
                 how To hotwire a soul

while I groove to the smell of Noxious
                     markers Allegendly

Dear Karen,

I taught a two-part creative writing course with Gabe Gudding at
Marshall County Correctional Facility in Holly Springs, Mississippi,
2001-2002.  It's a medium security prison and there was a high level of
motivation among the prisoners.  There was also an ethos of education,
particularly religious education, in the prison.  Two types of work were
particularly useful:  work with a strong clear structure which could be
exploited for the students' own writing, e.g., Christopher Smart's
Jubilate Agno ("my Cat Jeoffry"), which also appealed because its
rhetoric was familiarly biblical; haiku by Etheridge Knight and Richard
Wright, both from Mississippi; Joe Brainard's
I Remember.  I Remember also exemplified the second type of very useful
work: work that encouraged students to be daring in choice of subject
matter.  Russell Edson was good, and also offered the model of the prose
poem, which was very advantageous, especially at the beginning of a
course when the convention of end-rhyming can be deadening.  One of the
poems students used most was a translation (by Robert Graves, I think)
of the early Irish Amergin: students used the frame for their own
self-sketching in metaphor:

I am a Stag: of seven tines
I am a Flood: across the plain
I am a Wind: upon the waves
I am a Tear: the sun lets fall
I am a Hawk: above the cliff
I am a Wonder: among flowers
I am a Wizard: who but I sets the cool head aflame?

I am a Spear: that roars for blood
I am a Salmon: in a pool
I am a Lure: from Paradise
I am a Hill: where poets walk
I am a Boar: ruthless and red
I am a Breaker: threatening doom
I am a Thorn: beneath the nail
I am a Tide: that drags to death
I am an Infant: who but I peeps from the unhewn dolmen arch?

I am the Womb: of every holt
I am the Blaze: on every hill
I am the Queen: of every hive
I am the Shield: for every head
I am the Tomb: of every hope

Some students loved Hopkins.  Baraka's "SOS" got a strong response.
Limericks were useful forms which provoked entertaining subject matter.
In fact, the most useful work combined strong clear form and
unconventional subject-matter.

Good luck, I miss my students and find access difficult these days.

Mairead

Hi,
   I'm looking for poetry that would be suitable for male inmates of a
maximum security prison. This particular group is segregated from the
general
prison population. They have IQ's of 70 or less and are imprisoned
because of
sexual crimes and murder. I am looking to put together a packet of
poetry
that the inhouse educator/guard might find useful. Any suggestion of
resources/poems would be appreciated.
    Thanks, backchannel is fine.
     Karen

garbage can for rent. no bugs. ultra-cool, stainless steel,
contemporary minimalist design. round opening lets you
"frame" experience to fit your fancy. can is currently
located in silver springs, md, but can be hauled
tortoise-fashion just about anywhere once you get the
knack. it helps to drill eyeholes, unless you like
surprises, in which case you can simply stare at your feet.
eyeholes will, however, make the can less seaworthy, if the
sea's your destination. if the sea is your destination,
probably best to refrain from drilling eyeholes and rely
instead on sense of smell -- silver springs not all that
far from the ocean. bonus: all refuse yours to keep.

announcing:

the 4th Celebration of
Annual APG Day--
=93The Polyphonathon=94

(Annual APG Day commemorates the group=92s first public performance, and=20=

falls somewhere between Nov. 15 and Nov. 25 each year)



*********************

It's time for a Mono-punctuated Polyphon-a-thon with the APG.  What is a=20=

'polyphon' you ask? It's a multiple voice poem (a monophon is what you=20=

usually hear at readings). And because polyphons are in some respects=20
vocal music we'll break-up their tendency to overwhelm with short=20
monophons. It's earstrums at Eyedrum so bring your audio embouchure=20
because Lisp, is the word (LisP, [all] Language is Poetry).

Subject:      Qatsi
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

  "Director Godfrey Reggio on the Way We Live" (director of the Qatsi
trilogy)
 http://www.naqoy.com/naqoy/statement.asp

By any measure, we live in an extraordinary and extreme time. Language can
no longer describe the world in which we live. With antique ideas and old
formulas, we continue to describe a world that is no longer present. In this
loss of language, the word gives way to the image as the 'language' of
exchange, in which critical thought disappears to a diabolic regime of
conformity - the hyper-real, the omnipresent image. Language, real place
gives way to numerical code, the real virtual; metaphor to metamorphosis;
body to disembodiment; natural to supernatural; many to one. Mystery
disappears, replaced by the illusion of certainty in technological
perfection.

Technology, acceleration do not affect our way of living - they are, in
effect, our new and comprehensive host of life, the environment of living
itself. It is not the effect of technology on the environment, culture,
economy, religion, etc., but rather that all these categories exist in
technology. In this sense technology is new nature. The living environment,
old nature, is replaced by a manufactured milieu, an engineered host -
synthetic nature. In a real sense, we are off planet, dwelling on a lunar
surface of stone, cement, asphalt, glass, steel and plastics, engulfed in
the atmosphere of electromagnetic vibrations - the soothing lullaby of the
machine. The common notion tells us that technology is neutral, that we can
use it for either good or bad. From the p.o.v. of NAQOYQATSI, we do not use
technology, we live technology; technology is our way of life. Being sensate
entities, we become our environment - we become what we see, what we hear,
what we eat, what we smell, what we touch. Where doubt is prohibited, we
become, without question, the environment we live in. With our origins based
in the natural order, should this context radically change (as I am
suggesting), the mysterious nature of the human being shall also radically
change - a change that will reflect the transformation of nature itself, at
a turning point or vanishing point. Natural diversity becomes a burnt
offering, sacrificed to the infinite appetite of technological
homogenization.

So forget science fiction. We now live the fiction of science. We are now,
not in some remote future, cyborgs. We are at one with our environment - we
are technology. In this wonderland, freedom becomes the pursuit of our
technological happiness. Our standard of living is predicated on commodity
consumption, as the shibboleth of the new religion is 'pray for more'. In
vehicles of ecstasy, with cinematic engines of inertia at audiovisual speed,
trans-port and tele-port blend into one. The beginning becomes the end. The
port disappears in the speed of light. The nanosecond (one billionth of an
'old second'), technological speed, transforms reality as it creates an
ecstatic phenomena of compelling and unparalleled intensity. By human
measure, charismatic technique portends the miraculous, as it engenders the
condition of 'exit velocity' - a condition that blurs human perceptions,
shatters all meanings, drains all content and breaks our bonds to earth. All
locations are subsumed into the startling terra firma of the image, a
demonic conformity that is the genesis of massman. In the shadow of the
mass, all previous definitions crumble. The 'time' and 'space' of history
exit to an homogenized zone of no return. In this supernatural implosion of
g-force, human moorings give way, sending Homo sapiens out-of-orbit into the
void of technological space. The accompanying loss of original habitat and
our subsequent relocation into accelerated space, throws nature into
catastrophe, as it engenders traumatic stress syndrome as the now normal
condition of post-human existence. Technique, while promising comfort and
happiness, means power, means control, means conformity, means destiny.
Technology creates a condition of war that is at once universal and unseen.
The explosive tempo of technology is war; the untellable violence of
relocation in technology is war. All of us are refugees driven from our
human state.

As the completion of the Qatsi trilogy, NAQOYQATSI offers a cinematic
concert to experience the allurement, seduction and sanctioned terror of
ordinary daily living - a world at war beyond the battlefield, a
conflagration between old and new nature - total war. The vision of
NAQOYQATSI is a world made in the image and likeness of the new divine, the
computer - a world where unity is held in the vice of technological
homogenization, the globalized world of techno-fascism, the age of civilized
violence.

It must be noted that the production of NAQOYQATSI employs the very medium
that it questions. In doing so, we embrace the contradiction of using
technology to question technology. Given the intention of the film is to
commune, to connect, we employ the franca lingua of the technological
order - what Baudrillard terms 'the evil demon of images'. The image becomes
our location. We relocate onto the image, onto our venerated familiar, the
iconic, as we reshuffle the deck to offer an iconoclastic experience in the
form of a film. Indeed, the subject of NAQOYQATSI is itself the manufactured
image, a horizonless digital landscape, devoid of reality yet full of
promise. The tools that produced the film are themselves our subject.

I Reply: This reminds me, the Robert Creeley Best American Poetry
this year was (slings and arrows from some aside) a very good read. I
liked the Lease poem quite a bit . . . as well as many others by many
others.

Hard to see now why some people had so much to say against this
volume . . . or what there really is to expect from an anthology of
poetry anyway . . .

"John Latta is funny and deep. He watches things quietly and carefully,
suspicious of everything he sees and hears, I think, and he writes quiet
poems. You almost have to hold your breath to hear them, but they
reverberate like thunder and sometimes like a distant battle. These poems
are without precedence: the thunder and the battle haven't happened yet."
--Don Byrd

"In these poems we feel the verve and assurance of a most accomplished
voice, a wonderful sense of relish and improvisation that keeps
surprising. Latta's meditations lead us to unexpected, larger connections,
unfolding like mathematical narratives whose terms we may not have
guessed, but find exact, passionate."
--Robert Morgan

top. I=92d seen these before, you enter, take a position and secure the=20=

canvas around your head so it sticks out, then you don=92t have to smell=20=

years of human waste, you can stand or sit, it was a wonderful idea.=20
the entire convenience was on wheels, pulled around by an underdressed=20=

individual who had more pashaw than chutzpah. as was requested I told a=20=

fortune, since I knew there was never news from the front and never=20
would be.
        -once upon a time of wonder beyond myth and poetics lived a hunk =
of=20
coal named virgil, not the virgil that everyone knew, who played front=20=

center for the wiggle girls, this may all be true or it maybe false,=20
but this virgil was a major stock holder who was known to say; =93it's=20=

what you have that conquers what you didn't have.=94 a petty saying, =
that=20
went into the hall of sayings on a bronze plaque. this part-time=20
stockbroker was known for longer than normal speeches on the splendors=20=

of coal. these speeches went on longer than the typical speeches castro=20=

gave, a leader of a nation that technically does not exist according to=20=

some, that still keeps their leader alive by breathing monitors and=20
three tons of cigars a year. like castro, virgil kept saying; =93you =
have=20
to find a way to sell your goods no matter what the house and column=20
committee on fairness states.=94
        this story seemed to satisfy the procurer of this wonderful =
relief=20
station, so we did our business, exchanged one product for another and=20=

got ready for our ten o'clock appointment.

        ten o=92clock, all devices would be set at ten o'clock, as the =
binary=20
set off the bouncing mirror, no harmony, perfect harmony, angel food=20

        one - a pillar of solitude destroyed without anyone to talk to, =
simple=20

endless rumble of the ball rolling down the lane.

        zero =3D zero - everything and nothing in the same moment on =

since it keeps going around and around.
=09
        we arrived at wanna-jubilee-tammy-faye-baker street for our =
prenuptial=20
agreement. it should be as simple as stone, nothing to do with net=20
worth or gold thought - gold is god=92s child. it has nothing to do with=20=

god, that would come later after the indistinguishable starts mating=20

the process of many steps. steps from before, steps to follow steps in=20=

the sand steps, stepping in the river of steps, steps which are never=20
the same step, always different steps
=09
        we stood there reading the instructions on door number 10372-b =
of the=20
part time prenuptial agreemator. the instructions read: "when entering=20=

this door you are entering a prenuptial process that ends when it ends,=20=

begins when it begins.
        upon entering this door, grab a rake to the right (one of may =
rakes to=20
the right), all the while think of red roses, red tears, red of red=20
deep souls, karma red, structure of red, the red sea, a sea of red will=20=

be the world of red, a red universe, with red ants everywhere covering=20=

the red universe in the middle of a red ant universe, surrounded by a=20
nervous breakdown begging for relief in red roses.      once you have =
the=20
red rose firmly planted, enter the room and rake away your foot prints=20=

until you get to the next door and then knock three times."
        where the red of a red rose was suppose to be, I could only=20
manufacture shoe leather red.   with my mind still jiggling between=20
rapture and public domain signage, we arrived at the door of three=20
knocks.
        once we had finished raking the now silver dirt, I knocked three =
times=20
and just as the last knock finished vibrating through the heart of an=20
ancient tuva singer, the door opened with slow apprehension. as the=20
door opened the sun languished through the crack in a slow blue syrup,=20=

driving over our bodies with the sweet sex oil found in carnival=20
products that promise to keep you alive and smiling for eternity.
        in the glare just beyond my vision appeared some kind-of =
preorgasmic=20
worm that would swallow us whole in a hideous manner, from flesh to=20
bone, in toxic gastric juices not worth mentioning here, using us as a=20=

caterpillar would use silk for metamorphosis, turning into a stand-in=20
for rock hudson, or maybe the glare was coming from a gem stone=20
imbedded in the thick skin of a creature that would turn into wallpaper=20=

for liberace.   it wasn't a worm, but www trying to stop me before I=20
entered-
        -we shouldn't go in there, this doesn't feel right even to me =
and I=92ve=20
seen monkeys with wings strapped to their bodies, and poor poor judy=20
cracked up on speed . . . this isn't safe.
         just then the light went out and we couldn=92t see a thing, but =
heard a=20
voice that sounded like a cross between a cackle and ronald regan at=20
the beginning of brain failure during the pivotal years as governor of=20=

california.
        -oh I=92m sorry I . . . ah, I like to keep the shades open and =
let the=20
sunshine in . . . please, please do come in.
        =09
        slowly our eyes came back from their shellshocked retreat =
telling us=20
more than we really wanted to see. before us was a simple wooden desk,=20=

three fake wood chairs with red cushions, and on one of the fake wood=20
chairs, behind the simple wooden desk sat a head that was barely above=20=

the three sheets of paper stacked on top of the desk=92s monthly=20
calendar, that had names written in red ink in neat black squares, in=20
the middle of the simple wooden desk, in the middle of the beige room.=20=

within a moment or so or less this character with stone rimmed glasses,=20=

thick as a barbecue pit, looked straight at us, or as straight as you=20
could while looking through the earth=92s core.
        -please, please come in . . . I have your names here in red on =
the=20
blotter . . . . please come in and have a seat.
        the speed of light still singed my eyes, I grabbed www=92s arm =
for=20
reassurance, which was silly since we were both on the slight side of=20
hell and didn=92t want to be here. the one with the storage facility=20
glasses continued.
        -oh, please do not be afraid, I am here for you, to take you =
where you=20
will go from here.
        I started to notice this rhythmic pattern on my brain, it was =
4/4=20
time, that caused needles to dance on my spine, spilling out on each=20
and every nerve ending =93what?=94 just as I am about to scream in a=20
massacred shout, =93WHAT! WHAT! WHAT, there was a slide into another =
tone.
        -please, please, come in . . . please try to relax . . . there=92s=
=20
nothing to worry about.
        came a voice from below the desk=92s center drawer.
        -please . . . we must get started, so please sit down . . . =
really,=20
it's not so much a request, as a demand. there=92s plenty to do and I=20
have more clientele coming . . . so please, please, sit down.
        what could we do but let our personalities go and enjoy the red=20=

cushions on the fake wood chairs, and see what would happen next.
        again from the vertical hold and just below the surface,
        -since you two don=92t really fit the typical =93a / b=94 =
holding patterns=20
it will take some extra paper work, more holy water and special spirits=20=

from beyond that aren=92t normally called . . . but first, I must ask=20
your names for the record.
        -honey.
        -honey with a ie or a y? . . . and last name please?
        -just honey with a y, no last name.
        -ok, honey without a last name.
        -is this a legal name, without a last name, or one you adopted =
by fate?
        -fate, without a last name?
        -just honey then by fate, without a last name?
        -no, just honey.
        -honey then?
        -yes, yes just honey, then.

        this was getting monotonous. how many times did I need to tell =
this=20
full time bureaucrat, part-time prenuptial agreementor - honey, please,=20=

just honey. but before I could follow that root cause this officiating=20=

ambassador turned to www.
        -and you, what's your name for the record?
        -wicked witch of the west, old hag by the sea, crispy critter =
kali=20
prerequisite.
        I was amazed to see that tiny hand write like a ceiling fan on =
low.
        -is that it? I know in cases like this there are sometimes  =20
precursors and premonitions?
        -well . . . you could add, jessie james, billy-the-kid, marilyn=20=

monroe, Beelzebub and jimminy-cricket.
        -anything else, please don't hold back . . it=92s important we =
get this=20
all down for the record.
        -well . . . yes now that you mention it . . . holy savior mother=20=

virgin of the holy lands, seeker of alice b., with numbers and dates to=20=

go with each ghost, would you like them?
        -no, no, that=92s fine, yes that=92s fine . . . before we begin =
with the=20
powers vested in me by the terminal =93b=94 of the services of the =
homeland=20
divine talliers, I am required to do the following survey, do you mind?
        all I could see was the top of those eyes magnified ten thousand =
time=20
staring at use, creeping over the edge of the desk towards us.
        -no that=92s fine.
we both responded.
        -and you . . .?
        then with those same magnified eyes looking at www.
-do you go by wicked, wicked west, wicked witch of the west . . . what?
        - I prefer www.
        -good, we have that settled. now, before we begin, if you don=92t =
mind I=20
need to shuffle the proper papers so it can be said it was completed.
=09
        three sheets of paper where shuffled, three pieces of cheap off =
white=20
paper in a process that continued for millennia, through sunrises,=20
sunsets, full moons, natural and unnatural massacres, evolutionary=20
developments of certain species, the rise and fall of dictators,=20
oligarchies, and petty fist fights on east orange avenue. there was the=20=

super bowl, the king of super bowls, and an all out bowl performed on=20
the digitized ed sullivan show. fascinating events too numerous to=20
imagine or recount progressed on a rat=92s stationery running machine.=20=

some of the events we read all about later in the papers that were=20
stacked on our doorstep, approximately three hundred sixty four=20
thousand, eight hundred and seventy one newspapers. it=92s true some =
days=20
were missed due to strikes, mechanical failure, nuclear winters, and=20
change of governments. the last one hundred thousand or so newspapers=20
were incrementally shrunk in size and syntax. we had to learn how to=20
read all over again. and the bills, well, needless to say, I am glad we=20=

had opportunist insurance, since one is never certain when events like=20=

this will happen. the insurance company also hired fake parents to=20
watch the house, and keep up the mortgage payment that we still have=20
six years left to pay. the fake parents watched the animals as well,=20
unfortunately the cat died, but by the time we returned home toto had=20
learned to speak three languages, play violin and was hosting a cable=20
call-in show for new beginners and  escapees of the k-nine persuasion.
        slowly, with a fastidious gesture only a part-time prenuptial=20
agreemator and part-time hamburger inspector could offer. the papers=20
were shuffled as gently as butterfly wings. it was truly an art to=20
watch, especially since there wasn=92t anything else to do, but sit on=20=

red cushions on fake wood chairs in a beige room, in front of a desk,=20
and stare at a desk calendar that was on top of the desk, that was an=20
ink blotter, that was used to remember times and write names, and on=20
top of it all, three sheets of paper. slowly, the miniature hands of=20
this part-time prenuptial agreemator and part-time hamburger inspector=20=

whose head was mostly covered by ocean liner glasses, would take each=20
sheet of paper from the top of the stack of the three sheets and put it=20=

to the side of the other two remaining sheets, letting it rest for=20
while in its new position out of respect and then with the gentle touch=20=

of an unaware saint. the inspector would pickup the remaining top page=20=

and as carefully as before with the first sheet of paper, placing the=20
second sheet on top of the first sheet that now became the second page.=20=

it was truly a feat that took one to the inaccessibility of the=20
margins. as soon as the third page had become the first page, the small=20=

agile hands would straighten out the pile of papers to within one one=20
thousands of an inch of displacement, and then, ever so gently, slide=20
the pile of papers over to where they had originated, and again,=20
straightening the pile to within one one thousandths of an inch of=20
perfection, only to begin the beginning of the process again and again.=20=

I am not sure, but at the end of the millennium I think the original=20
top page ended up as the second page and third page became the number=20
one page. it was truly an amazing event to taste, as there were=20
miniscule paper particles that moved through the beige room, particles=20=

that would hang in the after freeze of the moment in midair, in=20
midmind, midsentence for days or maybe years, just lingering there all=20=

the while three sheets of paper were slowly shuffled, arranged and then=20=

reshuffled, then arranged and reshuffled again for one thousand years,=20=

to within one one thousandths of an inch of a supreme ideal.
=09
        then on a particular day that could no longer be calculated, at =
or=20
about eleven thirty four in the morning, the monsoon glasses looked up=20=

at us and said
        -first question of the survey . . . number one . . . given the =
option=20
of a middle brick house and one unwillingly caught in a particle=20
accelerator, which by heavens, could it be?
        that one caught me off guard a bit and I had to pause, but I =
think www=20
got the idea
        -yes?
        then it hit me just prior to the glasses nod of non-acceptance.
        -no!
        the answer seems insidious and as plain as day old bread, but =
our=20
answers where dichotomous, were we against the grain? what did it mean?=20=

would it stop us some how?
        -good . . . number two . . . there is no holding pattern?
        -yesterday, the day before yesterday.
        -very good  . . . very very good.
        I couldn=92t answer that one, why did www know the answer, was I =
stupid,=20
had I lost something in the last one thousand years? what did it mean=20
that only one of us could answer? what did it mean that this part-time=20=

hamburger inspector had said good? good was one of us waved on in a=20
puff of blue smoke? was good as good as an approval or just an=20
apparition? what was going on here and why did I need to know?
        -question number three . . . I am going to read a famous poem =
and I=20
would like you two to finish the last lines.
        afterwards garbled vision
        rose up in a howling poor cold
        bills divided between
        accountants and briefest of briefest once in a life time
        all the while cycles radiant silver
        glide by too busy to take notice
        take a break - fifteen minutes allotted
        so I store sunlight away
        in a paper bag and forget and throw it away . . .

        there was a station-o-station pause, we looked at each other, =
then=20
back to the grand peeping tom . . . nothing . . . no words came . . .=20
no utterances . . . a little breath, maybe, or at least it had a=20
semblance of representation, then nothing. nothing came to our tongues,=20=

throats, or lips, an empty pause was presented by another, then another=20=

and another and then another.

        then within the capacity of a gesture, our jailer finally spoke.
        -that concludes our institutional survey, we must get on with =
the=20
prenuptial prelude . . . mark your point, check your engines . . . are=20=

you ready?
        we both nodded like praying horses.
        it had been a thousand years, we were ready for anything, ready =
to=20
give-in and sign up for the new guess factor. destiny had revealed=20
itself, we could tell what was next.    it was the last page . . . but =
it=20
couldn=92t be  . . . there must be more somewhere hidden at another end=20=

of the book perhaps . . . in the margins . . . on top of something not=20=

yet known. destiny is like that, after awhile it becomes the one and=20
only and the body is the record and the record is the driver of a bus=20
that will remind you of the next stop.
        from somewhere that is nowhere, outside those beige walls that =
no=20
longer exist, barks something uncontrollable, just after the=20
announcement of premature ejaculation, a something uncontrollably=20
barks-back at the world, which it is an angry bark back to the original=20=

bark that precedes the original bite that was left hanging the original=20=

piece of damaged flesh that humanity has tried to recover from for=20
centuries, leaving an absent answer, a driving desire, a hunger filled=20=

with acidic compounds unknown to the universe, producing birth-aches=20
that cause new newborns to cry in unattained crusades. later when=20
language is amended and the cries turn to screams, to shouts, to subtle=20=

cannibalization, we=92re back where we started, a pregnant pause filled=20=

with endless bantering all day and through the night, in the brain and=20=

on the flesh . . . barking in the moment and filling the next with=20
barking.
        I stood alone with the voice in the crowd and someone came over =
and=20
said I want to tell you a dream.
        -I was in this dark alley, I wasn't sure why I was there. I met =
this=20
mechanic who said my car was ready. turning around I saw a 1967 light=20
green plymouth valiant up on a cardboard box, it was smaller than the=20
usual 1967 plymouth valiant. where there should have been tires there=20
was nothing but hubs the size of hamburger buns. after expressing=20
concern and doubt about the size of the hubs, the mechanic explained=20
they worked on velocity and the faster I drove the more friction was=20
created and the tires would expand to the size needed for the rate at=20
which I would travel. later, I was in the mechanic's shop, talking=20
shop, which seemed like the thing to do after having the function of=20
velocity, friction and expansion explained. it was a small shop, too=20
small for cars, that's why my car was worked on in the alley. then, as=20=

if by the magic of dropping a coin in the coin operated laundry, two=20
characters appeared outside the shop, nebula rings formed around them=20
transforming them from ordinary size to super sized bikers with=20
futurist hairstyles. as they transformed they came in the shop acting=20
as bikers do, so I decided it was time for a scene change. in the dark=20=

I saw john travolta driving up a hill on a golf cart, and then all of=20
sudden john stopped the cart and peeked through the snow fence. the=20
first thought I had was john was looking at me, then I noticed those=20
eyes were focused lower, on an old train underpass that connected two=20
train tunnels. there was just enough light in the air to show the=20
contrast of lightness in the world and the darkness of the tunnels.=20
just then, with a long range close-up, I could see what john saw, maybe=20=

I was john at that point, I don't know, but there was something moving=20=

between the darknes and the light. I had to use a special lens to see.=20=

I don=92t remember if john needed a special lens or not, I doubt it,=20
knowing john. what I saw as I focused in was the nose of a rat sniffing=20=

at a piece of food lodged under a rock in the tunnel, just inside the=20
lightness of the world. all I could see, and maybe all john could see,=20=

was this rat=92s nose sniffing for some food. all of the sudden, without=20=

warning, I was driving my car through the typical wormhole and sure=20
enough my tires were the right size. I will never forget the beauty I=20
saw traveling at the speed of light, whizzing by in my 1967 light green=20=

plymouth valiant. then without notice I was hovering above what I=20
thought was a nighttime football game, except there were no opposing=20
teams. everyone was lined up at the 50 yard line, and as the runner ran=20=

toward the main goal, and all the team members followed. mr. magoo ran=20=

the other way, while those who got to the goal line fell over and died,=20=

mr. magoo ran off the field never to be heard from again.
        then a bystander said,=09
        -this will never do  . . . this will never do.
        someone else from the crew heard the conversation and said,
        -it=92s time to close shop.
         my subsystems started to crash, at first slowly, then with a =
violent=20
rage everything started shutting down, all the bystanders disappeared,=20=

the crowd vanished, the marching band in black-and-red that trumpeted=20
the disappearance of the light in the basement, disappeared. generators=20=

all over the grid failed, back up flashlights coordinating the=20
interior, failed.
        icons and myths melted into a salient ooze, vanishing streets =
ripped=20
open into demented lust, hundreds of blank page dream journals where=20
crushed, vintage world war two bombers flying overhead were swallowed=20
by a large mouth abyss. just then a payload of pitfalls was released=20
proclaiming,
         -duck and cover, find a last minute shelter in your last =
minutes,=20
your discounts can no longer be redeemed . . . start counting backwards=20=

from 10.
10. emergency exits are shut down.
9. escape hatches have been sealed.
8. the navigational charts are burning.
7. the air is poisonous, filled with marble sized particles.
6. cooling and heating systems - have failed.
5. fail safe systems shut down and repair crews are kept at bay by=20
barking dogs
4. form ceases, the mouth ceases, the nose ceases, the eyes     cease, =
all=20
perceptual form has ceased
3. cells quit chatting amongst themselves
2. neutrinos fall out of orbit
1. all come to perfect stasis on the beaches of a quark.
0. nothing.


nothing beyond nothing.
words need not apply.
nothing.
zero.
formless form without form.
not one micron of measurable distance.
not a speck of dust to cherish.
nothing.
no names, no place, no propriety, all procedures are gone, history is a=20=

commode without its drawers.
the present is gone.
absolute zero.

        at that precise moment, within the beige walls, a worm screams, =
a drop=20
of blood appears on the right nostril of the part-time prenuptial=20
agreemator. the body of the part-time prenuptial agreemator collapses=20
into its preordained parts. then nothing. zero. nothing, but stackable=20=

flesh parts, that resembled something else but not that.
        at that precise moment we look at each other, and www grabbed my =
hand=20
as I grabbed www=92s hand. we were in each other=92s hands, holding each=20=

other=92s hand - looking at each other in each other=92s hand - pausing =
in=20
our eyes juncture, meeting in each other=92s pause, a hologram of=20
precession pauses - in a diamond field of pauses.
        at the next precise moment, I reached over and picked up the =
three=20
sheets of the shuffled paper, one sheet was blank, the next sheet was=20
titled prenuptial agreement questionnaire, which had questions on it,=20
but no answers. it felt like low grade copy paper between my fingers=20
and left an insecure feeling in my finger tips. the last sheet of paper=20=

was titled =93official prenuptial agreement.=94 it had been signed by =

Hi Karen,

I've a few things that might complement Mairead's and Jane's suggestions.
(By the way, Jane, that Etheridge Knight poem you quote from is "The Idea
of Ancestry" and can be found in his _Poems from Prison_, which he wrote
while doing time in Indiana State Prison in Indianapolis. PfP was published
in '68, the year of his release from that prison).

In addition to the classes Mairead Byrne and I taught at the prison in
Holly Springs, MS, I taught CW in a maximum security facility in upstate
NY, the Auburn Correctional Facility. I began a cw course there and then
taught it with a number of other writers from Cornell. All the inmates were
violent felons doing a whole bunch of time.

You're dealing with unusual and delimiting factors to me: (1) your students
being very slow (all of our students at Auburn were really smart, as were
the ones Mairead and I taught at Holly Springs); we just didn't have to
deal with the low IQ issue; (2) The other thing we didn't have to deal very
much with was, as you say, what the "inhouse educator/guard" might find
useful.

(1) Because you're going to be dealing with profoundly mentally challenged
people, I would stick with stuff that's not so formally complex. Mairead's
mention of the Amergin and Joe Brainard and the Jubilate rings a chord with
me here because of the use of anaphora in these pieces, which I imagine
might be appealing to the inmates. The Jubilate is going to be a stretch,
though, in many ways because of its allusions and period language (though
it is, essentially, a prison poem, as Smart refers to his "jailers" in the
asylum here and there in the piece). I wouldn't know what to expect from
people who are mentally handicapped: I might even, despite Mairead's caveat
about rhyming at the outset, start out with rhyme if everybody had IQ's of
70, might even try some Edward Lear and Lewis Carroll. Some other poems
whose content, clarity and form might be compelling are, say, Lucille
Clifton's pieces: her use of silence, line-break, the clarity of her
metaphors, and her stark, economical and crisp use of certain rhetorical
figures, not to mention how she carefully freights her poems emotionally,
might all be very useful. Also here some of CArl Rakosi's work or even
Reznikoff?

(2) I don't know what the guards and administrators are like where you're
teaching, but the ones at Auburn were often somewhat obstructionist -- or
at least that's often how it seemed. They had to approve everything we
brought in, all our course materials, and this was sometimes tedious. I
would often just sneak stuff in my satchel. Sometimes I'd sneak xeroxes of
political essays, once I xeroxed a whole book on Islam in America for a
guy, and many many poems that were considered, by dint of their content,
contraband -- such as stuff by Ed Dorn, Baraka, Corso, Knight, some
Giovanni, etc.

I found that the men at Auburn were much more polite with one another and
with the team of teachers than my undergraduates. They were used to being
polite with one another, because in a maximum security prison being polite
is a matter of life and death.

But because your students are very mentally handicapped and have committed
seriously violent sexual offenses and the like, I would obviously take
great care with content, steering clear of pieces dealing with violence and
sexuality (and that would rule out Edson, in my book, sorry Mairead).  But
I think that Amergin style and the Brainard are superb suggestions (except
for, as Mairead mentions, right?, Brainard's reminiscences often orbit
around his dong.)

Hi Karen - as odd as it may superficially may seem - I found great success
(among incarcerated teens) with Theodore Roethke's work. His use of rhyme
combined with all that oedipal authority/child vulnerability (I am guessing
here) works very well with ears that are obsessed (trained actually) with/in
hiphop rhyme structures. "Dirty Dinky" and "I know a woman lovely in her
bones" were always big hits and momentarily brought down everybody's guard.
Class improvisations off "Dirty Dinky" could be hilarious and communally
liberating.  And it's a way not to get caught-up with territorial
condescension/combat/gang issues that can emerge (sometimes dangerously) in
bringing hiphop to the plate.

Dear Karen,

Also, and further to Gabe's thorough response: it occurs to me that we
were fortunate in *not* knowing the students' I.Q.  Maybe I am mistaken
in that.  But I know--and I am talking only about the experience of a
year--that the less information I had, the better, especially in
relation to the prisoners' convictions and sentences (penal).  That
sounds counter-intuitive.  Nevertheless, it worked for me.

At the same time, by the end of this year, I had revised my original
approach of treating a prison classroom as much the same as any other
classroom.  The sadness of teaching in a prison is different from the
sadness of teaching elsewhere, or the "inexpungeable melancholy of the
pedagogical scene" in general, as David Lloyd calls it.  There is keen
suffering involved in a prisoner's situation, and dismay, from an
educator's perspective, at the sketchy connections, structurally,
between prisoners and education, at any level.

Finally, I agree with Gabe about Reznikoff, who has probably made the
most powerful / noticeable impact of any poet on students I've worked
with (outside prison).  I don't understand why Reznikoff's works don't
fly off the shelves.  Maybe because they're not on them.

And some of Edson is very sweet and tender; plenty of Brainard too!  One
of the great things about the prison in Holly Springs was *not* having
to second-guess or censor.  Working with Gabe was especially liberating
in that respect.  But the administration, religion-oriented though it
was, gave us a free hand in choice of materials; and bought all we
suggested for the library.

Hi Katherine,

Mindful of Jordan Davis's "the response model on a listserv is to ignore
ignore ignore," I note that you write to me in part:

          "your claims for your desires for an open
          debate seem disengenious to me-
          you did, after all, start this thing (i hesitate to call it a
conversation) in
          a private e-mail. the gesture to bring it into a public- but not
open- space,
          as far as i can see, was ron's."

This whole question of NYS/Canada, etc., originally stems from a comment Ron
Silliman made on his blog about my book -- not, as you seem to think, from
any private email of mine to anyone.

Ron's blog comment intrigued me, since I didn't think NYS was as much an
"influence" as he claimed (and as it obviously is, in one or two poems). I
addressed Ron in some private emails about this, wondering about the status
of NYS influence in Canadian poetry generally. I raised one possible answer
that might explain its apparent "absence," if such could be conceived (it
can: absence of discussion), on the basis of a lack of metalanguage for the
poets associated with NYS. (That is, I was not interested in explaining the
*presence* of NYS in Canada on the basis of personal influences on poets'
lives and works.)

Then, Ron asked me if he could cite me for one of his blog entries; and so I
discovered, along with anyone who reads Silliman's Blog, that he framed some
of our discussion in the context of NYS influence in Canada from his Yank
perspective. Following that, Ron posted emails from Tom (on Christian Bok,
who Tom says was not, the last time he met him, interested in reading Lisa
Jarnot and other NYS-ish contemporary poets), myself (yadda yadda), and
Kevin (on NYS at KSW). Mine especially, functioned as a quick and dirty
shorthand polemic (in a perverse mode that no one whom I directly implicated
liked -- think of it, then, perhaps, as a counterpoint to Brian Stefans's
sunny review style!), which spilled over here into a recent "shaming post"
from me to Darren W-H.

(I really don't know where an appropriate venue is at this point, for
further discussion and for laying out points of view in more than polemic
shorthand and flameworthy emails. I'm leaning towards the open letter or
essay [in either case, print or online]. Thanks for your invitation to post
on your blog comments bar, too.)

So, to kind of sum up, it's not that there was "public" discussion going on
about the question of the social (let's say on ubpoetics) that I then
decided to enter in a self-protecting way by sending a private email "under
wing of senior poet" Ron Silliman for his blog. Until Ron, Tom, myself and
Kevin posted, there was no discussion going on about this issue of the
social. Now, however, there might be such discussion (and of course it's
been held before, notably on this listserv in the early 90s). Interestingly,
no one *seems* to have found an appropriate venue in which to hold it --
which itself might say something about the structure of existing webspace
from the viewpoint of the question of the social as conceived from a
pre-internet frame and history. (This question of the social, post internet,
is what I think your remarks about absence or not of a blog comments
function are really about.)

Behestedly,
Louis

What duck sauce doesn't coat

Transfusions fire up the arteries
             circling w/ Tough resistance

Talking over the heads of Disagreeables
but who Suffers when

the dollars get Washed

The mad world does the Detente
           at summits and Protests

"the universe is full of lollipops"
                   that taste like Ass

And here there are only Jackals and Assassins

With financing I'll save Billions on
                       New Teeth while

My hands are Getting demagnetized

even the king of Backrubs can't
                undo your Knots and
                Laces

You sit quietly, Expecting to get sick

It is in these fearful moments We
                   delete our Speeches

to speak from diaphragms

With pentagrams on our foreheads
                 And flushed out

From hiding we spill out of testicles

Toward terrific boredoms and heartbreaks

Along artificial horizons, forever Archived
           in plain sight

 Arts Now

Award-winning B.C. poet George Bowering will become Canada's first
Parliamentary Poet Laureate.

He was appointed to the post from a short-list of three finalists.

Born in Penticton in 1935, Bowering served as a photographer in the RCAF.
Until last year, he taught at Vancouver's Simon Fraser University.

He's won two Governor-General's Awards for his poems "The Gangs of Kosmos"
and "Rocky Mountain Foot" as well as his novel "Burning Water." He's also
received the Canadian Authors' Association Award for poetry.

Bowering has over 40 titles of poetry, short stories and novels.

Paying $12,000 a year plus travel expenses, the position is largely
honourary.

His new duties will include addressing special occasions in Parliament,
giving advice to the Parliamentary librarian and sponsoring poetry readings.

The position was created when Senator Jerry Grafstein introduced Bill S-10.
Grafstein said he wanted to improve the level of debate in the House of
Commons.

This text is absolutely beautiful; I've bounced back and forth in the
hypertext version - it reads like a shudder/shutter - energy full of
Berrigan/Padgett meanderings years ago but held to fixed skeleton; it's
the sustained/sustenance intensity of it & all that energy! - going to
pass this on - Alan

Dear list.  Was just talking to a former student of Rexroth's a couple of
nights ago and the question of Rexroth's chips--up or down in the po-market?
came up.  I'd be interesting in hearing from folks who use Rexroth's work in
their classes and from people who include Rexroth in books and papers.
What's Rexroth's importance now?  Did the rather recent biography of R. by
Linda Hamalian (sp?) really do him in?  Is he included in anyone's canon?
in anyone's new anthology of significant forefathers? Why or why not?  Jess

The book is coming out in January. John Palattella wrote a very good review
of his work in last week's Nation. I'd be interested to see what others
thought of it. Basically, Palattella said that Rexroth wrote uneven poetry
for many years, but we don't have anymore Rexroths today. During the 1940s,
Rexroth wrote great poetry; it was that solid decade that we will remember
in turns of his poems. Many poets only wish they could have a decade like
Rexroth's 1940s.

Maria, Maria. Blowridge is just the ticket for level-of-debate
improvement, as we all know.

I am especially eager to hear his advice to the Parliamentary librarian.

Too much fun!

I think John was very honest in his appraisal of Rexroth and his admiration
for the poet and his poetry certainly resonate through the review.

Rexroth is one of the least understood U.S. poets of the 20th Century.  Being the
MC for the gala beat reading forever branded him as a beat during his lifetime.
His Collected Poems is a time for re-evaluation.  He's in almost every anthology:
Norton, Weinberger's, Rothenberg's, Forche's.

Things to look for in the new book:

-his early work, which was considered in the Objectivist's anthology, is some of
the best of that genre but are long overlooked.
-his love poetry may be the best we have
-his "nature" poetry has the inklings of a new human philosophy that Gary Snyder
went on to live
-his poem "Thou Shalt Not Kill" inspired Ginsberg to write Howl.
-he became an "asian" writer in the end, his work became a complete about face and
its hard to compare his last work to his early objectivist work and think its the
same guy

Hamalian loves his work, she was just honest about the man he was, which is a
completely separate story.

All--

At 7:30 p.m. on Thursday, November 14, there will be a reading of poetry in
translation at the Nora School, 955 Sligo Avenue, Silver Spring, Maryland.
The school is just off Georgia Avenue in downtown Silver Spring near the
D.C. line and the Silver Spring Metro stop.   More info is at
"www.nora-school.org/series.html."

The readers include Myong-Hee Kim, who will read her translations of work by
the Korean poet Lee Sang,  Paula Speck (me), who will read her translations
of Carlos Drummond de Andrade, Joao Cabral de Melo Neto, and Pablo Neruda,
and local Spanish-speaking high school students.

Cheaper than a trip to Asia or South America, free, and with modest
refreshments afterwards.  Hope some of you can come.

Paula

This reminds me both of Nietzsche's limping poet and Anne Bradstreet's

Small Press Traffic presents
Friday, November 15, 2002 at 7:30 pm
Judith Goldman & Chelsey Minnis

Judith Goldman?s Vocoder appeared from New York?s Roof Books last year and has
been honored as one of Small Press Traffic?s best books of 2001. "we are
promiscuous with force, there are no rules."  Goldman?s recent work appears
online at How2. She has just completed a dissertation on 18th century British
literature by women for Columbia University and her essay "Hannah=hannaH:
Clairvoyance, Politics, and Ethics in the Work of Hannah Weiner," appeared in
the differences Fall 2001 issue on postmodern feminist poetics.

Chelsey Minnis?s Zirconia appeared from New York?s Fence Books last year as
the winner of the first annual Alberta Prize and has made a splash on several
literary fronts. Arielle Greenberg writes: "the themes present in
Zirconia--beauty, cruelty, other/daughterhood--as well as some of the
recurring images--wings, fur, pearls--not to mention the title itself, with
its tawdry, dreamy sparkle, led me back to the days of Stevie Nicks, pegasus
suncatchers and Seventeen magazine's prom issue. Minnis fearlessly mines this
terrain for all its faux glamour and real heartbreak."


All events are $5-10, sliding scale, unless otherwise noted. Our events are
free to SPT members, and CCAC faculty, staff, and students.
Unless otherwise noted, our events are presented in
Timken Lecture Hall
California College of Arts and Crafts

Wisconsin)

To this micronaut, the "'round" looks increasingly like a fractal party of
the planets.  Proportion is as proportion does: all exits are wrong exits.

'in the lion's mouth' is explorative, musical, surprising, astounding,
playful, humorous, and thoroughly enjoyable.
mr clauss you are making poetry without words, works which inspire images,
feelings and narratives in the end-user. So interesting and inviting in
visual and tactile engagement that mental stimulation makes verbal
narratives free flowing from those who experience the pieces..
congratulations
brilliant

Parliamentary, my dear Bowering. I feel you should be addressed as "Sir
George", henceforth.
    All kidding aside, I am thrilled for you. I had a pure, selfless moment.
It iis as if your whole life had grown a fitting arrowhead, come to rest
with the most satisfying Plop in a maple tree. May its sweet sap cover your

from the Toronto Globe and Mail-

Irreverent Bowering named poet laureate



By ERIN ANDERSSEN


Tuesday, November 12, 2002 – Page A1


OTTAWA -- For their poet laureate, Canadians are getting a West Coast
writer with an irreverent muse, an obsession with baseball and a distaste,
his friends say, for all things pompous.

The politicians about to welcome George Bowering as the new resident poet
to Parliament Hill should be warned, say the people who know him: Most
witty when his targets are the country's haughty types, the B.C. scribe is
not an easy man to keep quiet when he has something to say.

"He has very strong opinions," said Fraser Sutherland, a Toronto poet.
"And if he doesn't manage to curb them, it should make for a very lively
appointment."

Mr. Bowering, 65, a two-time winner of Governor-General's awards with
about 50 books to his name, was chosen from a confidential list of three
candidates by the Speakers of the Senate and the House of Commons, after a
process that began with 35 names sent in by writers associations,
politicians and private citizens.

His job description is vague: Among his tasks, he may write poems for use
on state occasions and sponsor poetry readings, but he is not required to
do so. He will have an office on Parliament Hill -- although he is not
required to live in Ottawa -- and will be paid a yearly taxable stipend of
$12,000. He will have a travel budget of $10,000. He holds the job, which
will alternate between a French and an English writer, for two years.

His title is parliamentary poet laureate. The country has never had an
official poet laureate before.

Mr. Bowering, who did not return calls yesterday, will likely define the
new job.

Here is a poet with a clever hand at parody, who knows his history, having
written a quirky book on the personal lives of the country's prime
ministers and "swashbuckling" tales of his province's roots. "The best
thing about Canada," he once said, "is that it is not this. It is this and
that."

He dares to write on everything that strikes his fancy, believing, he has
explained, that those who stick only to what they know never learn
anything.

And he believes true poets should be "bell-ringers." In an essay on
writing, he once concluded, "The poet is the person waiting under the tree
for the lightning to strike. Waiting with pen in hand."

Though his new job may present a different kind of lightning strike, he
has not held his tongue so far, particularly in assessing Canada's
literary culture. A sampling: He once slammed the government in an
interview for being "chintzy" in its cultural spending, while it "throws
million of dollars at businessmen."

In an interview with Canadian Content, he said that 94 per cent of new
fiction is unworthy of reading, and the worthy stuff doesn't get read --
especially, in his view, by the academics who teach it. He has particular
venom for the people granted "unearned power" who, he told The Globe and
Mail in 1998, "have never taken life seriously and therefore do not read
or appreciate or help serious writing."

Most recently, Mr. Sutherland recalls, he entered into an on-line debate
on ae plagiarism charge against this year's Man Booker Prize winner, Yann
Martel. Mr. Bowering, Mr. Sutherland said, alone expressed the view that
"it did not look good," sparking an immediate protest from others.

His outspoken nature, even when his views may be unpopular, is what
promises to make his term as parliamentary poet laureate "delightfully
controversial." No one expects him to recite odes to the Queen. "He can
find the humour in high occasions," chuckled Victoria-based poet Patrick
Lane.

But Mr. Bowering is not without depth, observed his old friend, William
New, an English professor at the University of British Columbia, who
shared an office with him in graduate school.

"He is serious about things that are serious," Mr. New said. "I expect he
will puncture those things that take themselves seriously but don't really
matter."

Born in the Okanagan Falls and educated on the West Coast, Mr. Bowering
retired last year after almost three decades of teaching at Simon Fraser
University. Aside from an obsession with baseball, he has previously
acknowledged being a fan of professional wrestling. He won the
Governor-General's award for poetry in 1969 and in 1980 for fiction.

He is an "outstanding choice," said Senator Jerahmiel Grafstein, who
introduced the private-member's bill that created the poet laureate.
"Hopefully his words will inspire members of Parliament to be more
literate. [And] poetry will occupy a more conspicuous public place."

Sometimes in mid-April we fill our hot-tubs
with Perrier water, we are so pacific, west
coasting through spring, casting not a thought
to our poor cousins in Toronto, slogging

through dirty snow to their cute restaurants
with nifty names. Casting not a thought
but delivering an image if we can, posing
wisely as the people who were foresighted enough

to create a city with warm winters. Would anyone,
they ask in gelid Ottawa, live on the edge out there
except for the weather? This will make
a good enough question for a gentle poem to pose.

"The Father of Pakistan"

Bollywood’s reply to "Rambo," released simultaneously
     with Ashutosh Gowariker's "Lagaan," "Gadar:
Ek Prem Katha," was shot amid protest: mobs stoned filming
     in Amritsar; earlier, Shia Muslims
Threatened self-immolation over music-and-dance scenes
     planned for Lucknow's labyrinthine
Asifi Imambara. Once released, Anil Sharma’s
     partition-era epic sparked Muslim riots in

Bhopal, New Delhi, Ahmedabad, Amritsar, Lucknow and Mumbai,
     even as largely Sikh and Hindu
Audiences cheered on Tara Singh (Sunny Deol), punching his way
     through Pakistan to retrieve Saqeena
(Ameesha Patel), whom he'd saved from mobs of rioting Sikhs
     in the film's first forty-five minutes.
Plot-wise, it's boy meets girl meets class and religious divide
     with abrupt patriarchal "conversion"

Suspended until the last few of the film's 190 minutes, when
     Saqeena's father (Amrish Puri), wealthy
Ex-Amritsar Muslim, now Mayor of Lahore, swoops down in private
     helicopter wielding firearms, accidentally

Nicking beloved daughter before losing control &
     crashing to prompt beating by son-in-law Singh.
In an interview, Patel responded to charges of Pak-bashing:
     "I received calls from Lahore and
Karachi, telling me how much they loved the film there ...
     how can there be anything
Anti-Islamic about the movie? ... Tomorrow if I fell for a Muslim,
     I would marry him.
Love is the essence of any religion." Director Anil Sharma
     answered similar accusations: "I
Think you're not reading my title carefully: It is "Gadar: Ek Prem
     Katha" (in English, "Revolt:
A Love Story"). I'm showing that one should not repeat the
     mistakes of the past. Love is supreme."

Historically, partition has been regarded by artists as semi-
     taboo: poets, novelists and filmmakers largely
Avoid the subject. In fifty years, only a handful of literary works,
     such as Bapsi Sidhwa's "Cracking
India" (which inspired Deepa Mehta's "Earth"), have addressed
     the partition and its aftermath.

Hindi film, likewise, offers a dearth of partition-related features--
     Kamal Hasaan's "Hey Ram!" for
Instance, the aforementioned "Earth," Dr. Chandra Prakash
     Dwivedi’s forthcoming "Pinjar" ... but
Not much else. Controversy can kill a project. Deepa Mehta's
     "Water" was to be a fictionalized account of
Disobedient landlord who rents out top floor of building
     left in will to shelter widows--
Unbeknownst to tourists staying in the renovated guestrooms
     above, there are women beneath them,
Starving. The film was to be shot on location, in the city of Varnasi,
     on the Ganges,
The site of many real-life "widow houses." Before production began,
     some 2,000 people stormed the sets
And after burning them, threw their remains into the holy river.
     Mehta's life was threatened, followed by
News of protesters burning effigies of the director. "Breaking
     up the sets was far too mild an act: the

People involved with the film should have been beaten black
     and blue," said the head of the KSRSS,
A political party formed the night before to specifically target Mehta.
     "The west refuses to ac-
Knowledge our achievements in any sphere," he continued.
     "[The west] is only interested
In our snake charmers and child brides. And people like
     Deepa Mehta pander to them."
Still, Mehta persisted, and the local government allowed
     filming to continue as rumored protests
Topped 10,000, but after two takes of the film's first scene,
     government authorities
Arrived on the set and ordered Mehta to cease. A protester
     had swallowed poison, then
Nose-dived into the Ganges, a rock tied around his waist.
     The film was never completed. Faiz

Kahn, reviewing "Gadar" on brother Omar’s Lahore-based
     English-language Hot Spot Online, calls
Anil Sharma's epic a "revenge drama," claiming Pakistanis
     will find it "repugnant."

But he elaborates: "We ourselves are responsible for turning
     the Indians into the most hated
And heinous of villains in many of our films," noting that
     "Gadar"'s plot "sounds like
A reverse of recent Lollywood smash "Tere Pyar Mein," referred
     to in another review as "as vile a piece of
Propaganda as the Bollywood films it attempts to emulate."
     Fifty-five years have passed since

Hindustan was quit by the British and partitioned, displacing
     more than ten million, mostly Punjabi,
And resulting in a quarter million deaths--to say nothing of the
     thousands raped, mutilated, and
In many cases forced to convert religion--a fate elsewhere

Robert Beck Memorial Cinema Presents


19 November 2002   9:00 pm


ALAN SONDHEIM

Curated by Marianne Shaneen

RBMC presents new digital video, live reading, laptop demo and other work
from Alan Sondheim, multifarious maverick of video, film, CD-ROM,
performance, sound, text, cyberculture and hypermedia. His books include
the anthology "Being on Line: Net Subjectivity" (Lusitania, 1996),
"Disorders of the Real" (Station Hill, 1988), and ".echo" (alt-X digital
arts, 2001). For the past several years, he has been working on an
"Internet Text," a continuous meditation on philosophy, psychology,
language, body, sexuality, and virtuality.

"worlds, tribly" - 35 minute digital video, Alan Sondheim and Azure Carter

the chant of trilby-svengali... 85 worlds intersecting: the torus cutting
across...the seven watching men, the doubled doubled seven watching
men...the swollen mold and its emission...the double framing window... **
-A.S.

For more info about the work of Alan Sondheim be sure to check out these
urls! http://www.asondheim.org/ http://www.asondheim.org/portal/


RBMC is a laboratory for the auto-didact, a genuine Temporary Autonomous
Zone for cine-mavericks and metaphysicians, and a realm to disorder and
regain the senses. For more than 4 years, the Robert Beck Memorial Cinema
has illuminated the snowy-white screen of the Collective Unconscious of
New York.... the enigmatic Mr. Robert Beck, soldier of the 1st World War,
lost his senses in battle and later, recovering in a sanatorium, regained
them while watching a film!

Bradley Eros & Brian Frye

...the extraordinary Robert Beck Memorial Cinema... captures some of the
improvisational feeling of earlier avant-garde film presentations, also
accommodating films and related events that require unusual projection
set-ups...probably my favorite place anywhere to see films -Fred Camper


DIRECTIONS:
RBMC is at the COLLECTIVE UNCONSCIOUS
145 Ludlow St., NYC
between Stanton and Rivington
1.5 blocks south of Houston St.

SUBWAY:
F train 2nd Avenue stop, walk east on south side of Houston past Eldridge
(you will see the Sunshine Cinema Movie Theater on the corner of Eldridge
and Houston), Allen, and Orchard streets, and turn right (south) on
Ludlow. The Collective Unconscious RBMC is on Ludlow between Stanton and
Rivington, on the West side of the street.

FROM WILLIAMSBURG BRIDGE:
Once off the bridge take a slight Right onto DELANCEY ST., turn Right onto
ALLEN St., turn Right onto STANTON St., and turn RIGHT onto LUDLOW St.

FROM MANHATTAN BRIDGE:
Off Manhattan Bridge, turn Right onto CANAL St., turn LEFT onto ALLEN ST.,
turn RIGHT onto STANTON ST., then turn RIGHT onto LUDLOW ST.


**worlds, tribly - 35 minute digital video -

85 worlds intersecting: the torus cutting across, the sparrow flitting
from one to the other, the golden droplets swarming among them, the seven
watching men, the doubled doubled seven watching men, the woman from the
london gaiete shuddering, the second woman adding and removing dressing
and corset, the man and woman swirling and watching across, the woman with
the cross evolving and splitting and shuddering outward, the white stars
in the blue-black sky, the yellow stars in the blue-black sky, the great
fabric of being and the construct of the helices, the mouths wide open,
eyes wide open, the look of astonishment and the gaze, the swollen mold
and its emission, the bearded man, the torus bending and shuddering, the
torus taking on the colors and patterns, the sparrow flitting, the inner
and outer spaces, the backdrop spaces, the seven watching men ...

the dark break

the double framing window, the window embossing, the small victorian
blouse, the body staring and disappearing, the serene landscape, body
through the landscape, the quietening sounds, the fading out ...


*/
the chant of trilby-svengali.
i am her trilby to her svengali and she is my trilby to my svengali.
i trilby make perfect fuck, sharing the dream of svengali and trilby:
trilby to svengali's edison, dolly shot in cinerama, her trilby to her
svengali, my trilby to my svengali. she nobody. svengali and trilby make
that trilby. that into into night night window from
folding. against of folding jacket. trilby, my my is singing woman.
i would be that woman that trilby.
trilby, she is my woman, she is singing within the woman.
hair hair duplicate face. body would trilby. be into that night trilby.
my trilby, is my singing singing against without there without singing.

It was reported that Admiral John M. Poindexter, who was convicted in
the
Iran-Contra affair in 1990 but later acquitted on a technicality, joined
the Bush Administration earlier this year as head of the Office of
Information Awareness at the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency.
Poindexter is in charge of a new system called Total Information
Awareness, which would permit the military to spy on the civilian
population of the United States without search warrants by scanning
personal information such as email, credit-card statements, banking and
medical records, and travel documents for patterns that suggest criminal
or terrorist activities. Deployment of the surveillance technology would
require new legislation, since the military traditionally has not been
allowed to spy on ordinary American citizens. "This could be the perfect
storm for civil liberties in America," said Marc Rotenberg, director of
the Electronic Privacy Information Center, "The vehicle is the Homeland
Security Act, the technology is Darpa, and the agency is the FBI. The
outcome is a system of national surveillance of the American public."

i was reading jpeg scans of Kurt Cobain's journals the other night in _The
Observer_  and noticed that Cobain cut out some lines from a poem by Alicia
Ostriker, pasting them just above a self-portrait and a draft of some of
his lyrics for "Smells Like Teen Spirit"

I like the abstractions and references to mathematics in Rexroth's longish
poems.  I don't much like the late Asian Rexroth.  But I have those two
paperback volumes "The shroter poems of rexroth" and "The Longer Poems of
Rexroth" and they are fun to peruse.  He has surprising metaphors based on
scientific objecs, current (then) events, modern objects, absurd situations
and so forth, which is unusual and fun to read.

***

WEDNESDAY NOVEMBER 15 [8:00pm]
KAYA PRESS READING: JOSEY FOO, SESSHU FOSTER AND ED LIN
Josey Foo's first book of prose and poems, Endou, was published in 1996, an=
d
portions of it were included by Jamaica Kincaid in Best American Essays
1995. Inspired by "Arrival," Tomie Arai's 1996 mixed-media installation at
the Lower East Side Printshop in New York City, Tomie's Chair, her most
recent title just out from Kaya Press, is an allegory of outward and inward
movement. Foo won the Eve of St. Agnes Award in Poetry in 1995 and is a
recipient of 2001 NEA and Pennsylvania Council for the Arts Literature
Fellowships.

Kaya Press has just published Sesshu Foster's glitteringly surreal first
novel, Zenzontli, the Keeper of the House of Darkness. Lawson Fusao Inada
applauds: "Sesshu Foster startles you, surprises you, even shocks you; his
writing sparkles with new insights and images; at the same time, he engages
you in the context of continuing history and you realize you're in what
could be familiar territory: 'Ah, yes =8B how it is!'" Foster's City Terrace
Field Manual (1996) was a finalist for the PEN Center West Poetry Award and
the Passaic County Poetry Prize, and Invocation L.A.: Multicultural Urban
Poetry, which he coedited, won a 1990 American Book Award. Angry Days, his
first collection of poetry, was published in 1987.

Ed Lin's title Waylaid from Kaya is the story of a Chinese American boy who
struggles to grow up in the grip of an overcharged sexual environment. It i=
s
a story told with a Gen-X-style bleak humor that doesn't pander to
conventional notions of immigrant narrative, a switchblade in the gut to
stories of over-achievement and success in America that ignore the human
cost. Ed Lin currently lives in New York, where he is a member of the Asian
American performance troupe Peeling the Banana.

FRIDAY NOVEMBER 15 [10:30pm]
LYCAON PICTUS AND JAMES WALSH
Lycaon Pictus features the new dynamic duo of musicians Aaron Diskin and
John Morton. A two man band that "[has] a sampler that we run beats off
of...[John] plays bass guitar on some songs and keyboard on others. [Aaron]
plays keyboard and sings. We play weird little Avant-Pop songs. We're not
dance music, and we're not rock n roll. We're almost like poetry or folk
accompanied by electronic instruments or something. We will be playing slow=
,
soothing songs."

James Walsh's video art projections have been exhibited at the Brewster
Project, in the Tugboat Film & Video Series at Socrates Sculpture Park, and
in the Bronco 89 Video Series. He lives in Brooklyn.

[Generation Time and DJ Brett Crenshaw (originally scheduled to appear with
Lycaon Pictus) will not be in attendance. However, there will still be a
reception afterwards.]

Someone very close to me works directly under Poindexter ("John") in that
organization.  No shit.  It's very VERY real.  I hear all sorts of "stories"
coming from that direction and have heard them for many many years.

And some of you think I'm just paranoid.  Heh.  Say "Hi!  It's me!"

Oh, and by the way, not onld do they "have the ability," um, they're already
doing it.  I could actually give you specific examples...but don't kid
yourself: this conversation is being watched.  They aren't the sort of
people I exactly want to fuck with.

Harvard Speech Canceled
Concerns Voiced on Poet's Words Against Israelis

by Patrick Healy

A Harvard University speech by an award-winning Irish poet was canceled
yesterday after Harvard president Lawrence H. Summers and several
professors and students complained about the poet's verbal attacks on
US-born Jewish settlers and Israel's treatment of Palestinians.

The poet, Tom Paulin, was scheduled to deliver a public reading on campus
tomorrow evening. While students and professors were organizing a boycott
of the speech, Summers expressed his own concerns about Paulin in two
recent conversations with members of Harvard's English department, which
had invited Paulin to speak.

Summers has become a prominent critic of what he sees as anti-Semitic
activities on college campuses.

Through a spokesman, Summers said yesterday, ''My position was that it was
for the department to decide, and I believe the department has come to the
appropriate decision.''

Paulin, who also teaches at Oxford University, has been a longtime critic
of Israel on British television news programs and in his own writing; last
year, for instance, he published a poem referring to the Israeli Army as a
''Zionist SS.''

He gained notoriety this year when he was quoted in an Egyptian newspaper,
al-Ahram Weekly, describing Brooklyn-born Jews moving to Israeli
settlements as ''Nazis'' and ''racists'' and saying that they ''should be
shot dead.''

A Harvard official said yesterday that English department members were
''in ignorance'' about Paulin's views when they invited him last winter to
deliver the prestigious Morris Gray poetry reading. English department
members said Paulin's selection was based solely on his poetry, which has
explored sectarian violence in Northern Ireland and won several prizes,
including the Somerset Maugham Award.

The English department and Paulin mutually agreed to cancel the speech,
according to a Harvard statement. Efforts to reach Paulin at Oxford were
unsuccessful.

There was some division in Harvard's English department over the
cancellation, with two members telling the Globe that it was appropriate,
but another member saying it was ''an insult to free expression and the
department's independence.''

(From ELO website)

When the award-winning digital artist Talan Memmott came to the Graduate
Program in Creative Writing at Brown University this fall as an MFA
candidate in electronic writing, something new was happening. He followed
upon such previous e-lit luminaries as Bobby Arellano, Shelley Jackson,
Mary Kim Arnold, Mark Amerika, Matt Derby, Judd Morrissey, and Noah
Wardrip-Fruin, but all of these writers were accepted as graduate fiction
writers, not electronic writers.

And now the unique fellowship awarded to Memmott has been converted into a
permanent annual Creative Writing graduate fellowship in electronic
writing, perhaps the first of its kind in the world (any challenges?). It
offers tuition and a stipend, partly earned in the second year by teaching
workshops, which in the case of those holding this new fellowship will be
electronic writing courses, thereby expanding the university=92s course
offerings in the digital arts.

Applicants should follow the existing Creative Writing guidelines,
applying to the genre of choice (fiction, poetry, or playwriting) with a
clear indication of interest in the digital field. Although there is only
one such fellowship at this time, it is hoped that other electronic
writers might, through the quality of their writing, be accepted within
the traditional genres, thus augmenting the digital community here.

In addition to providing print writing samples in one of the three genres
(the electronic fellowship is not genre-specific), applicants should
submit examples (or documentation) of their electronic writing by way of
DVD, CD-ROM, videotape, or web address (URL).

who's (in young america) left?


about verse-

Although it publishes an array of work and ascribes to no single style,
the magazine has become known for promoting the work of younger American
poets working within or against the lyric tradition.

That early Objectivist group was an interesting collection of people.  Alger
Hiss was also an Objectivist.

Hiss bought a big farm in Carroll County, Maryland back in the 1950s.  Of
course, this was the famous pumpkin-patch farm.  I grew up in Carroll County
and some of my earliest memories involve the local big deal about the Hiss
case.  My parents would slowly drive past the place telling me about the bad
man who used to live there. I didn't learn about Hiss' poetic activities
until much, much later.  I've never thought about pumpkins, poetry, spies
and Tricky Dick the same way since. Jess

i'm tired of this stuff. it doesn't make any sense. culling stuff from the
net or operating system doesn't make art. the mystery's in the production,
not in the stupidity of lists no one can interpret. sure, it's a
cathechism - it makes the account go round, but so what? it's got no
meaning by itself, any more than an automobile wiring diagram takes you
someplace. codework is stupid this way; it's nothing more than a minor
art. if you don't try for greatness all the time, you're insulting your
audience. this is just absurd.

Jesse Glass has conflated history a little here in stating that Alger
Hiss was an Objectivist.



It was Whittaker Chambers, Zukofsky's college roommate, who published in
the Objectivist issue of Poetry. Whether that makes him an Objectivist
or not, is your call. Other participants in that issue who have not gone
on to be called Objectivists would include Ted Hecht, Robert McAlmon,
Kenneth Rexroth, Howard Weeks, Norman Macleod, Henry Roskolenkier, Henry
Zolinsky, Jesse Lowenthal, John Wheelwright, Richard Johns, Martha
Champion, William Carlos Williams (tho he is sometimes treated as the
kindly uncle of the Objectivists) and Joyce Hopkins.



Hopkins contributed what may have been Poetry magazine's first one-line
poem, entitled "University: Old-Time":

Dis in napa now trailing the sterilized.



That may be a reference to Napa State Hospital in California, even then
a locked psychiatric facility.



Chambers went on to become the editor of Time Magazine & was later
involved in a plot to smuggle atomic records. Chambers broke with the
Communist Party & infamously became an informant. Chambers fingered
Hiss, an important second-tier government figure, as his source.



More interesting in this regard might be the decision of the Oppens to
leave the U.S. & go into exile in Mexico within 24 hours of the arrest
of Julius & Ethel Rosenberg. Had George's sister, June Oppen Degnan, not
been so well connected in the Democratic Party, they might have remained
in Mexico well beyond 1959.



I recall that when Jimmy Carter asked Fritz Mondale to be his
vice-presidential running mate, Mondale called Degnan - a key fundraiser
for the Dems - before he called his own family.

Please come to this and stick around for the 4:00 p.m. reading by the west
coast's amazing Kathleen Fraser and my all-time favorite comics artist (and
Kevin Killian superstar) Phoebe Gloeckner! Kathleen's going to read at least
one new "poet's theater" piece (!) and Phoebe's long-awaited book, The Diary
of a Teenage Girl, half (fictionalized) journal/half (fictionalized)
auto-bio comics, will be available for the first time.

Here's the blurbs:

Phoebe Gloeckner, a critically-acclaimed cartoonist originally from the Bay
Area (where she performed in a number of Kevin Killian's plays), recently
moved to Long Island. She is the author of the searing and occasionally
banned A Child's Life and a brand-new hybrid novel/journal/comic book, Diary
of a Teenage Girl (both from North Atlantic Books). Read her work at
www.ravenblond.com/pgloeckner/

One of the Bay Area's most beloved poets, Kathleen Fraser was a founding
editor of How(ever) and its online manifestation, How2. More importantly,
she is the author of more than a dozen books of poetry, each more inventive
than the next. About her Selected Poems, Patrick Pritchett notes her
"devotion to discovery, her willingness to risk, and her profoundly lyrical
sense of the intimate." Her homepage is at:

Does anyone know of a book that catalogs figures of speech, cliches, etc in
the English language, and explains their origins?   I have a dictionary of
slang, but it doesn't cut the muster.

Jesse, I believe local Carroll County folklore has it that  - at least in
October of each year - an apparition of Alger Hiss would appear over
Whitaker's Pumpkin patch, the annual sight of which practically spooked him
to death. Enraged he apparently would call the FBI and various US Senate
Committees to investigate the patch. However, none of his former "ears" and
allies, neither Senate Committees, not even Richard Nixon himself, wanted to
come out an be caught looking for Hiss' spook among the pumpkins, which
always seemed larger than any others grown in the Valley.
But being a local and privy to such stories, I can understand the
Whittaker-Hiss confusion. Whitaker's vulnerability to apparitions, by the
way, permanently dismissed him from any credible association with the
Objectivists.

The Holloway Poetry Series Presents

Robert Grenier and Tim Wood

Tuesday, November 19
Colloquium with the poets begins at 4:30 p.m. in the English Dept. Lounge,
330 Wheeler Hall, UC Berkeley

Readings begin at 6 pm, Maud Fife Room, 315 Wheeler Hall, UC Berkeley

     Over the years, Robert Grenier has been the inspiration for repeated
rethinkings of what poems are. Working progressively toward a more and more
immediate encounter between word and world, Grenier=B9s work can be seen as a=
n
embodied phenomenology. The philosopher Edmund Husserl was an early
influence, and literary influences have included Robert Creeley (whose
Selected Poems Grenier edited) and Larry Eigner (with whom he worked for
many years). Grenier=B9s published works include Sentences, a box of very
short poems on cards, published by Whale Cloth Press in the early 1970s,
Series (This Press, 1978), Oakland (Tuumba Press, 1980), A Day at the Beach
(Roof, 1984), Phantom Anthems (O Books, 1986), transpiration/transpiring
Minnesota (O Books, 1995).
     Examples of his current work (holograph poems) can best be seen on the
Internet at http://www.thing.net/~grist/l&d/lighthom.htm.

     Tim Wood is a 3rd-year graduate student in the U.C. Berkeley English
Department. He has an M.F.A. from The University of Iowa Writers' Workshop
and has had poems published in Gulf Coast, Atlanta Review, and The Nation.

Free and open to the public;
Sponsored by the UC Berkeley Department of English

For further information about the series, please contact J. Scappettone at
jscape@socrates.berkeley.edu.

Aaron,

Richard Lanham's _A Handlist of Rhetorical Terms_ is more or less a standard
reference for figures of speech.  It's in its second edition from the U of
California P.

Also, a guy named Gideon Burton has a really useful website called "Silva
Rhetoricae" at Brigham Young:

http://humanities.byu.edu/rhetoric/

It's basically a compilation of definitions and examples from various
classical and early modern rhetorics.

---
I just typed this all out and looked at your question again and realized
that this wasn't quite what you were looking for.  You probably want
something that tells you where expressions like "that's the way the cookie
crumbles" come from, right?

Oh well, I'll send this anyway, just for the hell of it.

Best,

Kasey

pair of quotaion marks on it and submit it to google.

The University of Wisconsin has an ongoing project to create The Dictionary
of American Regional English (DARE), which is being published by Harvard
University Press,and many such things are in those volumes, four of which
have been published so far, with at least one more to come. Possibly not
for every household, but your library may have a copy of the volumes to date.

This is absolutely terrific; it reminds me of a nonstop 25-hour drive I
did between Dallas and Los Angeles - and I love the constant signpostings
of time and space and musings and the short/curtailed structure as if it's
the result of dictation or fly-by-day-or-night signage high-speed coasting
& it's the vector alone that makes this country, you're always x-ing fron-
tiers one way or the other or both, this one loops & great writing - Alan

Speaking of outdated, Francis Grose's "1811 Dictionary of the Vulgar
Tongue" is worth a look=2E You won't find much of contemporary idiomatic
relevance in it, but the charming 18th and 19th century obscenities alone

The news I have from a friend who lived there was that Whittaker Chambers
came in the 1950s to live in County Caledonia in Vermont, in a little hamlet
called Peacham, to write his memoirs.  Are memoirs Objectivist?  Peacham is
just across the Connecticut River from Bethlehem, New Hampshire - "Poetry
Capital of the USA" it says on its outskirts - home of one of the many Frost
Places, and home also to Franconia College, where, in a slightly related
story from thirty-odd years ago, Louis Zukofsky read, splendidly it is said,
despite having lost his dentures the night before, somewhere at his hotel.

As a footgnote to Ron's informative post re the many( non) Objectivists: in
1962,my first year in grad school at Berkeley, Tom Parkinson assigned me to
write a research paper on the Objectivists, of whom I had never heard. He
suggested  start by phoning Kenneth Rexroth, which I did. He told me : "In
the first place, there was no such thing as an Objectivist movement. In the
secon place,  didn't belong to it."

But then along came Oppen and Reznikoff, each, as I maybe imperfectly
recall, published in part by New Directions; I think Mrs Degnan, or Oppen
himself, bore some of the costs.

Then, along came Rakosi, unearthed by Andrew Crozier. I had read some of his
early work in journals in the U.C. library. He did several very good
parodies of Wallace Stevens back then. But Stevens could never have written
a Rakosi poem.

Sorry for the cross-postings. Please forward to all.

In coordination with Andrew Stafford, UbuWeb is pleased to present the complete contents
of issues 1-9 of Aspen Magazine. Apsen, a multimedia magazine of the arts was originally
published from 1957 to 1971. Each issue of Aspen was delivered to the subscribers in a
box, which contained a variety of media: printed matter in different formats, phonograph
recordings, and reels of Super-8 film. Stafford has remediated the contents for the web,
using RealAudio, QuickTime movies, Flash, MP3s, etc. Comprising nearly 400 artists,
UbuWeb's acquisition of Aspen Magazine increases UbuWeb's content base by almost a third.

The site contains a vast number of rare MP3s of Aspen's sound works including artists
such as Yoko Ono, Marcel Duchamp, Merce Cunningham, John Cage, The Velvet Underground,
William S. Burroughs, La Monte Young, etc.

The film section contains works by Robert Rauschenberg, Hans Richter, Laszlo Moholy-Nagy,
Robert Morris, and Stan VanDerBeek.

Actually the Oppen title was a co-publication with New Directions. Degan's
co-imprint was called The San Francisco Review (I believe) at least
something with "San Francisco" in it. The real mystery to me would be why it
came out as a co-pub. Either it was because Mrs. Degan (and it was her
money) was not going to let ND take all the pub glory if ND was not going to
put up the money to do the books. One must ask why J Laughlin distanced ND
from the project - preferring a co-pub - and would not pay the whole bill. I
suspect it was not because he was broke. Was it because he viewed Oppen and
Reznikoff as wayward children of Pound that had to be put in a compromised
box (i.e. pay their own way)? At best a sympathy vote from ND with no
associated costs.
Anybody have the real story? Of course someone will ask if we are back into
Semitic issues.

Poetry the Configuration of Lies


the sentiments in poetry are surely never meant to be taken at face value,
how shall i love thee, i'm heading towards armageddon, i think that i
shall never see, even language poetry is guilty of phrasing whose meaning
cannot ever be taken literally or performatively. so what you say. i say
that by its very deflection into the niceties of language, poetry lies,
largely through hyperbole, or the placings of hypotheticals where none are
warranted. poetry is our great escape; we use it to express what-if worlds
without building all of their contents, piece by piece as in the novel -
the bridging effects of the language suture over any anomalies. it does
leave a distaste in the mouth; people rarely read poetry because the lies
are caught out, and the descent into language is just too problematic or
exhausting. isn't it enough we use language all the time, without having
to examine very word of it, over and over again? and every poem is guilty,
surely, of this, every poem has its moments of fascination with fictions
that are never revealed as such.

"O ever present in my view! My wafted spirit is with you, And soothes your
boding fears: I see you all oppressed with gloom Sit lonely in that
cheerless room-- Ah me! You are in tears!" (S.T.C) if ever present, then
his sight is clouded, like a speck in the eye or detached retina. has he
lost his spirit? is it always bothering here? is she completely and always
oppressed? when did this happen? lies, all lies, but a pretty conceit
nonetheless. and hardly think for a moment the exemptness of contemporary
poetry. it suffers under the weight of false performance. nothing happens.
nothing has happened. better an engineering drawing that is translated
more or less one on one to the reality of the concrete.

poetry reduces our morals, can present nothing but false sentiments,
remains a disease which infiltrates our body politic. Plato was right, but
not by virtue of the Dionysian; it's the Apollonian semblance of truth
that decays from within. better to live in an emotional world of speaking
and writing which insists on nothing but confusion, fuzzy boundaries, and
exhilarating thought, the world of the short story or fantasy, clearly
demarcated as such, even the world of the docudrama and its other trans-
genre equivalents. poetry allows anyone to say anything and get away with
anything; if it were not for poetry, Coleridge would be exposed for the
stalker he clearly is.

thus poetry is a configuration of lies, and should be ignored by all prac-
tical people, which is basically all of us who live in this world, and
have not yet gone to the next.

Les Atomes non crochus, 1967 (sam old say mold)

i don't live with the inka essenhigh book anymore..
you sleep naked on a turtle's back at the edge of rivers oceans ponds, =
an endless series out into the night
how many languages, bodies of water, forced to chant them
for that a castle of trees
you fist the giant slug in its secret grotto
feeling the yellow halos of its genital torsion belt=20
score your rubber-nibbed forearm and clench
sensing its abandon, you pull it from the knot-hole
and toss it down into the clockwork shredding of history
a bed of leaves for a flesh of iridescent foam
it builds up a simple decoration
a window lattice=20
symmetrical shudders in blind hierarchical arrangements
discrete historical units
baybayin stacked in the drool closet
lifts a draping houl from the doorway
perfect ways to do nothing at all
nothing stands before the mirror
then tries a stable window lattice
mosquito larva hover along its noisy alley
you might endlessly display my face as a volume of nits
i choose a t-shirt, Marcel Marien
and find some tea-leaves
i shirk the duties
staring at chunks of bread on the lawn
the crows eyeing me vaguely
brown mustard shapes on the curb
dog ornaments, wolff dad
suddenly the world is tiled, and smooth again
the cool ceramic skin of abstraction, silly viagra, nosologia beep beep
crisp rust rises as a failed blade of song
then crumbles=20
god inside out it says
shut away in this box
i cannot beautiful child riding the manatee
i cannot lay the clocks open to rage
i cannot rate headscarring narwhal
i cannot paste finality
i cannot wage the pretty leprosy of insect mating
Bull's Eggs
yellow tires
Satyr and Sartre converge on the soggy note
stickmen
dirt
longboats lay shadows in the mighty moss
Baby Islam
Tea-Neck NJ
what happens for the next hundred years
red star of limonata
junk yard
plastic centaur radio
stuck on moleskinned thighs
Jamaica 1655
the innocence of powder monkeys
perspektive cop cars

Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"; format=flowed

There will be many posts on this, but a shorthand account of how the
Objectivists got to be called the Objectivists is contained in my preface
to Conviction's Net of Branches: Essays on the Objectivist Poets and Poetry
(originally published by Sourthern Illinois UP in 1985, but now reissued as
a Spuyten Duyvil book).  There are others in L.S. Dembo's interview with
LZ, in Kenner, in any number of books touching on the period.

As to the story turnings mentioned in Ron's post and others.   Chamber's
brother, is the "Ricky" appearing in Zukofsky's "A"--see Mark Scroggins
book, Louis Zukofsky and the Poetry of Knowledge, for more details on the
'scene.'  And to complicate matters just a bit further, Milton Hindus, who
wrote on and championed Reznikoff's work, had an essay in his Black Sparrow
collection touching on Witness by W. Chambers.

I realize this thread's long been over, but I keep coming across books of
sonnets that were not mentioned, so here are two more with one example from
each:

bacchae sonnets 1-7 by Armand Schwerner (pod books, 1977)

bacchae sonnet number one

first you burnt your hair, its spider filaments
on a blind trip through your crown, branches short-circuit
the gray pathways, if you burn it the hair won't cut
the neurone repetitions, root in the nerves and eat,
the hair is outside, you are the food, you will be the tent
around your life, you will guard, you will make a sheaf
like wheat and bind your hair with hair, you will pardon
the world, leave no clippings for the enemy,

who is outside, you are the food, this is a death
you inflict, not accident, and a tent for comfort,
within it you will practice judging your friends
and will pardon the hornets and the zooming groundwasps,
the diving whine after you around the garden shrine
and you will offer up your children and their wild menacing hair



Snoring In New York by Edwin Denby (Angel Hair/ Adventures In Poetry, 1974)

Alex Katz paints his north window
A bed and across the street, glare
City day and I within know
Like wide as high and hear as far
New York School friends, you paint glory
Itself crowding closer further
Lose your marbles making it
What's in a name- it regathers
From within, a painting's silence
Resplendent, the silent roommate
Watch him, not a pet, long listen
Before glory, the stone heartbeat
When he's painted himself out of it
DeKooning says his picture's finished

Gunfire in my Poem


Minus the streets and houses the Search
                  is Coming up roses

Amid much ado, I am thinking of you
               Jean Valentine, who I
               don't remember Meeting

Or you Ms. Levertov, I hope Still somewhere
                       Typing away

The whole World's in my Lap today

And the fishes of the Sea aren't happy
                      About it

Deny me reentry to the Buttons of pants

While targets Get filled with the latest Leads

Roundup the suspects who come to Mind
                    from sketches and prose pieces

No one wants to save Human nature

Blank slates can be found By every Exit
And who's to Say we've Got the
                     Real Killers?

Cover me as I roll past Bonfires
             on postcards and
             into the Furthest reaches

of Dark ego in these Poems.

We spend Rounds keeping track of Our
               vicious detractors

Communicating with the specters Who
               inhabit Whiskey bottles

Put out, whether vanilla or Red leather
           with all the comforts of
           homes forever on the Market

"I wanted to be a Cowboy"


Jump for joy if joy's Your thing or

Kool it down to the pulse of
                Nothing special

It takes you Over, the crush But
             it's virulent The

irresistible future That possesses us All

hands And feet Must follow the twostep
                    of Roundup

Lasso me to the Closest tree while
            Cowpokes assure themselves

of their Awesome powers and On

I also Wanted to be President
         but wasn't Sharp enough

Too fool so many or deal w/
             The consequences that

ensue.  I'm a selfish Guy, I fight

the dumb battles to get myself Ahead

But what's effective Now is the Slow
                 reasons to follow,
                 Gravity brings us

A little too Close, bumping into the

                 Nucleus, which, at dance
                 Parties is a wild one

that flirts even with chaperones

pin me to a donkey or Mule
                          whichever is
vanishing quicker And needs the love

Walking Tour with David Carter and Bill Morgan
The Beats on the Lower East Side
$12 for members, $15 for non-members.
To reserve a spot, please call 212/475-9585.
Meeting at St. Mark's Church, 10th Street near 2nd Avenue.


The Beats were an association of poets, novelists and musicians who, starting in the 1940's, sought a new way to see the world. Their quest for this new vision laid the groundwork for the cultural and artistic innovations of the 1960's. From early in their careers, the Beats lived and worked on the Lower East Side, and this tour will take you to the key locations associated with them. The tour will be led by two colleagues of Allen Ginsberg, Bill Morgan, Ginsberg's archivist and editor of Deliberate Prose, a collection of Ginsberg's essays, and David Carter, editor of Spontaneous Mind, Ginsberg's interviews.

* The use of the phrase "so-called" prior to an aesthetic categorization is
an old experimental poetry tradition; please disregard if it causes you

Call for Visually Informed Writing/ Handwritten Work


3rd Bed announces an open call for visually informed writing/ handwritten
work.  We are especially interested in work where visual art and/or
experience is not The Other, but is somehow absorbed by the writing itself.

This may include: poetry made with scissors and glue, organized data,
language as markings/invented language/pictographs, children's drawings tha=
t
incorporate language, handwritten work, graffiti, collaborations, visually
engaging notebook pages, and on and on....

We prefer receiving poetry submissions via email.  Please send as word
attachments or jpegs to associate.poetry.ed@3rdbed.com.  Emails must say th=
e
word Submission and your name in the subject headline.  If you prefer to
send via snail mail our address is 3rd bed, 131 Clay Street, Central Falls,
RI 02863.



About 3rd Bed:

3rb Bed is a print journal in its 4th year of production.  It is currently
distributed by Ingram.  Writers we have published include: Michael Burkard,
Robert Coover, Bei Dao, Patricia Eakins, Elaine Equi, Christine Hume, Camde=
n
Joy, Gary Lutz, Allen Sondheim, Diane Wald, Diane Williams and others.


About 3rd Beds:

We have seen that there are three sorts of bed. The first exists in nature,
and we would say, I suppose, that was made by god. No one else could have
made it, could they?
I think not.
The second is made by the carpenter.
Yes.
And the third by the painter?
Granted.

Please pass this call along to anyone who may be interested.

Poetry the Configuration of Truths


the sentiments in poetry are meant to be taken at face value, how shall i
hate thee, i'm heading towards heaven, i think i shall see, even language
poetry presents phrasing whose meaning can be taken literally or perform-
atively. so what you say. i say that by its very deflection into the
horrors of language, poetry tells truths, largely through diminution, or
the placing of facts in a problematic world. poetry is our great mirror;
we use it to express the world in its fullness, as in the totality of the
novel - the intensity of the language brings out anomalies. it goes down
sweetly; people often read poetry for its truths and exalted descent into
language. everyday language is never enough; we need examine it, bury
ourselves in it. every poem is innocent, every poem fetishizes the real in
pristine clarity.

"O ever present in my view! My wafted spirit is with you, And soothes your
boding fears: I see you all oppressed with gloom Sit lonely in that
cheerless room-- Ah me! You are in tears!" (S.T.C) if ever present, then
the language is redolent of the truth of faithfulness, a second-sight or
ectoplasm. he has gained a spirit which enhances her own. she is captiva-
ted, enthralled; he is her primordial origin. this is the difficult truth
which only poetry can capture. think now of the fecundity of contemporary
poetry. surely it lives within the truth of performativity; everything
happens, everything has happened. poetry counteracts the engineering of
the concrete, revealing the truth beneath the surface of empty structure.

poetry cultivates our morals, presents true sentiments, behaves as thera-
peutic infiltrating our body politic. Plato was wrong, not by virtue of
the Apollonian; it's the Dionysian truth that emerges, voluptuously, from
within. better to live in the world of poetic truth, than the falsities of
docudrama, contemporary news media, or popular novels. poetry allows all
of us to refine or sentience; if it were not for poetry, Coleridge, and
the rest of us, would have remained permanently mad.

thus poetry is a cornucopia of truths, and should be read and practiced by
everyone, all of us who live in this world, with clear vision towards the
next.

I'm really happy to have opened this subject up.  Chambers' relationship
with L.Z. and his translating activities are new to me.  Question: could
anyone post some of Chambers' work, or is it on-line somewhere?  I read the
Objectivist issue of Poetry many many years ago and do not have access to a
library to get it again.

Since Ron Silliman is on the line here: is or was Rexroth important to
L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E writing with those early experiments of his?

It's interesting that someone mentioned Rexroth's use of mathematics in
poetry when the Hamalian bio. mentions somewhere that he was not at all good
at the subject.

Thanks again for some great responses!  Jess

Jesse,

My sense is that Rexroth wasn't particularly important to any of the
langpos, but not necessarily for the best reasons.

He was still around the Bay Area in the '60s & into the early '70s, a
bookstore owner in SF who occasionally got quoted in the papers but
seemed not to have any connection with any writers I knew -- Duncan
included (although I know that's not true in any strict sense, but I
never heard of RD speak of him, as he would even of Tom Parkinson or Jo
Miles). His bookstore did not stock much poetry and no small press
stuff.

In the 1950s, Rexroth had one of the earliest TV literary shows on KQED
TV in SF (maybe back when Joanne Kyger worked there). He sat in an easy
chair next to a round table stacked with books, he would pick up one
after another and give some sort of commentary. Which often enough was
just him grumbling "Complete rubbish." At which point he would toss said
book aside. It was a comically fascinating show, but if my grandfather
was not at one of his VFW meetings, we would watch boxing instead, then
standard Friday night fare on one of the three networks.

Ron

I have infected my mother with the web art virus, and now she is making =
web art, despite having other responsibilities and tasks which should be =
done instead.  She has to write several articles which are part of an =
extensive print project and she normally would be writing and submitting =
to non e-sources...=20

She and I collaborated on a piece called Lunch =
(www.sporkworld.org/Deed/lunch.html)  This piece is a partial response =
to the thread about how to console ourselves after the election.

Anyway, if people are willing, my mother would really like to know how =
the piece could be improved and what is good and bad about it.  Since =
she hasn't done anything like this before, she is a little bit at sea as =
to what is considered good practice, what is innovative and what is a =
cliche of the genre, etc. etc.  Since I am writing this and replies will =
come to me, you can be as nasty and blunt as you like.  I shall make =
sure to prepare my mom psychologically for any truly defamatory =
responses :-) =20

By the way, we did the movie as an animated gif rather than a flash =
piece (since it isn't interactive),  I have never done this but it seems =
like a viable alternative to Flash in many situations.  It doesn't =
require a plugin and it is a lot easier to control how long each frame =
lasts  (you don't have to stretch along a timeline!).

For what it's worth, I think Rexroth's legacy is most clearly apparent today in the work of Robert Hass.  Here's something Hass has written about him:

"In What Hour, Rexroth's first book, seems -- with its open line, its almost Chinese plainness of syntax, its eye to the wilderness, anarchist politics, its cosmopolitanism, experimentalism, interest in Buddhism as a way of life and Christianity as a system of thought and calendar of the seasons, with its interest in pleasure, its urban and back-country meditations -- to have invented the culture of the West Coast."

The quote is from Hass's essay on Bay Area writers in _Twentieth-Century Pleasures_.  He also talks briefly about Duncan.

Nick Etal. I know of Shwermer's poems (esp his one's on/re/de the ancient
tablets which I found myself - I like to think I "discovered" Schwermer
independently) now this sonnet is marvellous, or at the very very least very
interesting: something a little Stroffolinic about it (!)..... But where
does Schwermer "fit in" so to speak in the panoply or the "canon" (ouch!
wrong word!)...Also: the obvious - why sonnets? - of course the answer I
know partly: it is because of Shakespear and others of his time and Petrarch
and the tradition and so on: but is there any fundamental significance in
the line numbers: eg the number 14 is of course 2 x 7 ...... this number I
feel is probably arbitrary except that in the "universe of culture" its a
bit like pi  or  e which are constants in the physical or the "real "
world......so we have so many biblical and other references to seven that it
becomes "fundamental"... but then so is 2...after all 2 might be the number
of the digital age; and so on....what are your thoughts on, or what do you
or others know about sonnets: I  have tried to write Shakespearean sonnets
(in iambics and with the rhyme scheme) and the result is very bad but the
idea of keeping to 14 lines (or any number is attractive ) and of course
when one says sonnets there are many evocations and so on...  (A penny or a
dime for) your and others' thoughts if any.  Richard Taylor.

Dear Everyone,

   I'm going to do a reading in NYC on June 24th. I'd love to get other
readings in the "Northeast Corridor" around that time to help cover my plane

helps. Backchannel please if you think of anything.

Thanks!

A billionaire's ode to charity: $100 million to poetry journal
--------------------

By James Warren
Tribune staff reporter

November 17, 2002

In the early 1970s, an unsolicited poem arrived in the Chicago office of Poetry, a small, influential but typically financially strapped literary magazine. It was from a Mrs. Guernsey Van Riper Jr. of Indianapolis.

Joe Parisi, the editor, thought it good but not up to the standards of a monthly known for running the works of titans of 20th Century poetry, including William Butler Yeats, W.H. Auden and Dylan Thomas.

Perhaps it was Parisi's handwritten rejection note. Or similar rejection notes he'd send over the years to the same woman, whom he has to this day never met or even spoken with. But, along the way, Mrs. Van Riper grew to have affection for the publication, the kind that may change the state of poetry in America.

Van Riper, who later divorced and switched back to her maiden name of Ruth Lilly, is the last surviving great-grandchild of Col. Eli Lilly, founder of Eli Lilly and Co., the pharmaceutical giant. At 87, she is a very low-profile, ailing billionaire-philanthropist who will now alter the 700-square-foot world of the four-person magazine housed in the basement of Chicago's Newberry Library.

Lilly will stratospherically increase her own previous donations to Poetry by giving it well in excess of $100 million over the next 30 years, with no strings attached. The stunning development, the result of a new estate plan approved by an Indianapolis court and confirmed by lawyers, was outlined, though not fully detailed, by Parisi Friday at a dinner that the magazine held at the Arts Club of Chicago.

"Yes, it does seem to have a couple of extra zeroes at the end of the number," said Billy Collins, the U.S. poet laureate, who attended the dinner. "It is probably an unprecedented gift to a literary publication. It's a wonderful and good thing, unambiguously good, that Mrs. Lilly has done."

And, in a grand understatement inspired by the turn of events, Parisi said last week, "Ruth Lilly has ensured our existence into perpetuity."

The monthly, whose paid circulation is a modest 10,000, was founded in 1912 by Harriet Monroe, a former art critic for the Chicago Tribune, and its storied past includes running the first major works of Carl Sandburg, T.S. Eliot and Wallace Stevens, as well as important efforts by Robert Frost, Ezra Pound and William Carlos Williams. It has flirted with poverty, frequently having less than $100 in its till, but it has never missed an issue, and thus is believed to be the oldest continuously published literary publication.

Lilly, who is childless, began writing poetry in the mid-1930s, said her attorney, Thomas Ewbank. She "did not take personally" the rejections from Poetry and proved to be a fan and loyal contributor, establishing in 1986 its annual Ruth Lilly Poetry Prize, which was initially $25,000 and has grown to $100,000. She also has sponsored two $15,000 annual fellowships via the magazine, as well as a professorship in poetry at Indiana University.

Lilly has been no less an enigmatic presence in Indianapolis, donating significant sums to academic and arts institutions, but in very understated ways.

The most notice she's received, besides the various donations, came amid some controversy several years ago over millions of dollars spent on European and Hawaiian travel for her and entourages of more than 30, including 26 personal staff members. The money came from the conservatorship into which her estate was placed in 1981.

But even knowledge that her estate exceeded $1 billion did not prepare the Chicago magazine for what was in the offing.

Message from a lawyer

Ewbank contacted Parisi last year, indicating that he had been instructed to devise a new estate plan for Lilly. Ewbank "suggested we obtain counsel, since the plan was so complicated," Parisi recalled. At that point, Parisi had no clear sense of the money involved, but he enlisted the services of estate specialist Richard Campbell.

As the Chicago attorney explained, there are essentially six different pots of funds created by what are known as charitable lead and remainder trusts. For example, out of three trusts, there will be one annual payment to the Modern Poetry Association, which oversees the magazine as its publisher, for as long as Lilly lives; a second annual payment over the next 15 years; and a third annual payment over the next 30 years.

With much of her wealth turning on Eli Lilly stock, which has had a topsy-turvy year (dropping from the mid-$80s to the mid-$40s, closing Friday at $61.30), one can make only broad estimates of values. Ewbank, citing his client's personal preference, did not engage in estimates, leaving them to the magazine.

But, by conservative assessments, the first payment, in January, will be about $10 million. And, over the course of the 30 years, a conservative estimate is $100 million, but it could well be closer to $150 million, Campbell said.

Ewbank would only say, "There are people who can snatch defeat from the jaw of victory. But assuming they have a good investment committee and controls, all they need be is prudent and conservative and this will provide them the base they need."

Such a sum would vault the association into the forefront of vaguely similar, arts-related non-profits. By comparison, the total assets of New York's John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation are $219 million.

For sure, change will come swiftly once word breaks out about such good fortune. Old donors may well be reluctant to maintain their level of giving, while fledgling poets and others may inundate the magazine with requests for money.

With so much funding from one source, tax laws will require the Modern Poetry Association to become a private operating foundation rather than a so-called 501c3, its current tax-exempt status conferred to qualifying political and cultural institutions and interest groups. It is applying to change its name to the Poetry Foundation, but it will still be able to receive tax-deductible contributions.

High hopes for big bucks

Deborah Cummins, president of the association's board of trustees, said the group will seek to increase its various educational programs; devise seminars for teachers nationwide to teach poetry (aimed at middle and high school teachers); expand grants and fellowships; and increase the publication of books via its Poetry Press.

And, no surprise, it wants to use the money to buy its own, far larger and separate headquarters in Chicago. Along the way, it also hopes to find public space for thousands of books of poetry, which surpass those of most colleges and universities but are virtually all in storage.

"The magazine, as our crown jewel, will obviously remain. Perhaps we can pay our authors more [whether you're a Pulitzer Prize winner or unknown undergraduate, it pays $2 a line]. We aim to keep it the premier journal devoted to poetry in the country," she said.

As for long-term impact, Collins said, "The only thing I am sure of is that when the news breaks, it will draw a lot of good attention to the magazine and poetry itself.

"It reminds me of my father, a New York businessman, not being too impressed by my poetry writing. Then I got a $25,000 grant from the NEA (National Endowment for the Arts), and he started taking poetry seriously."

Sorry all-

No date or city mentioned below...but the reading is this Saturday, Nov. 23,
from 4-7 PM, at the Bowery Poetry Club in Manhattan.  That's in New York
City (for those who require complete clarification).  Forgive me for the
repeated e-mails.

Also, I wanted to add, I'll be releasing a 2-CD set of some of my creative
work on Saturday.  I'll have some copies of it with me if you want one.  1
cd will be standard audio, a collection of some of my music under the name
of Blindfolder.  The second cd of the pair is poetry-oriented and for your
computer.  It has Lester's full-length book called _Be Somebody_, along with
about 90 minutes of mp3 audio (mostly readings), a copy of the full
proximate site, some more poetry, and some critical articles.  This is the
first time I've released a book or a CD.  In this case, I'm releasing a book
AND an album AND "more."  2CDs, $10.  It's a sort of fetishistic objet
d'art.  Brought to you by Imitation Press.

I think that's a very reasonable price, no?  Lemme know if you don't think
it's so reasonable.  Anyway, I'll make a more "formal" announcement later.
Gotta call my Marketing Department first.  Heh.  In the meantime, if you
know you want a copy, lemme know.

Hey, maybe "Poetry" can hire some editors that don't have their heads stuck
up their asses!   Just kidding, y'all.

Question about this paragraph--

"The monthly, whose paid circulation is a modest 10,000, was founded in
1912 by Harriet Monroe, a former art critic for the Chicago Tribune, and
its storied past includes running the first major works of Carl Sandburg,
T.S. Eliot and Wallace Stevens, as well as important efforts by Robert
Frost, Ezra Pound and William Carlos Williams. It has flirted with poverty,
frequently having less than $100 in its till, but it has never missed an
issue, and thus is believed to be the oldest continuously published
literary publication."


The Atlantic Monthly has been published since at least the 1880's-- isn't
it a "literary publication"?  Or has it ceased publication at some point?

Whispering to myself,
Aaron

Ditto.  It seems like horribly bad financial advice,
or an incredibly sloppy bit of philanthropy.  What
could any one journal do with that amount of money?
It's just too much.  Imagine: she could have secured
at least *one hundred* journals into perptuity, as
Parisi says, by giving them $1 million each.  Imagine:
ONE HUNDRED really well-funded poetry magazines just
thriving, with no risk of annihilation, in this
country.  Every bookstore could carry all one hundred,
because they would all have remarkable distribution.

And this, of course, thinking very small.  With that
money, she could have built poetry libraries,
guaranteed the future of a dozen different literary
orgs, brought thousands of first books into print,
bought books for schoolkids and prisoners and the poor
all over the country, sent kids to college, etc., etc.


I guess this provokes that game: if someone gave you
$100 mil for poetry, what would you do with it?

Arielle

PS All I can hope is that Poetry will turn around and
start a press, some spin-off journals, found a couple
hundred new prizes, divest, divest, divest.

jot me down as part of the jaw-dropped contingent... this much $$
could have changed the face of u.s. poetry... as it stands, it would
seem likely only to shore up the battlements...

Excuse the shameless self-promotion, but my first book
of poems, GIVEN, is officially out from Verse Press.

You can read more about it on my new web site
(feedback welcome by backchannel--it's still in
process), www.ariellegreenberg.net.  The book can be
ordered from Small Press Distribution, an independent
book catalog, at www.spdbooks.org, or from my press,
www.versepress.org, or through Amazon.  Or you can
order it directly from me.

Anyone who wants to review it can also contact the
press, and see about the possiblity of review copies.

Yippee, and thanks!
Arielle

I think in some ways this is good news. It might lead other philanthropists
to endow other journals. My fear is, however, that birds of a feather...
Meaning, you might now see other (new) funds going to Poetry as well. But,
I have been in development for a bit, and seeing $100M going to a journal
like Poetry is just crazy. She obviously has no philanthropic advisors.

Ron: Yes,it would seem, on the Jesse's "langpo influence" question.
But a number of your other facts are off course, and misleading.
Kenneth - I actually was a neighbor and got to know him a little - never was
a bookstore owner. "Kenneth Rexroth Books" on Union Street was owned and
managed by someone else who was permitted to use Kenneth's name as: 1. a
branding of a very well known literary name in the City , and 2. An outlet
(in part) for the resale of the huge number of review copies that Kenneth
received from all over the country.
One of the ways he made his living was as a reviewer.  My recollection is
that he had a regular column from at least the Fifties on in Saturday Review
of Books, for a long while a very successful national mag. He also had a
regular - possibly weekly - book review program on KPFA (Pacifica
Foundation). He also had a column in the SF Examiner. He not already
reviewed poetry, but every conceivable subject that commanded his interest
(Physics, religion, politics. He recorded his show at home - on the corner
of Scott and Page on the edge of the Fillmore - over Jack's Records, to this
day a great source of jazz on 78 vinyl disks. The radio tape was regularly
interrupted to the sound of horns on the street. Listening to him was always
an eclectic adventure of scooting from a discussion of thermodynamics to
William Carlos Williams to Boheim to a screed agains Trotskyism. Of course,
though he always spoke with authority, it was never clear if he was An
authority, rather than than similar to a mighty Library who knows a little
bit about much more than every crosses most of our transoms! But it gave him
lots of books to resell. In about 1972 he took a job as a professor of
literature at UC Santa Barbara where he taught most of his remaining years.
He probably had one of the best private libraries in the State - one that he
built as studio in his backyard. I believe he died about 1976.
Rexroth precedes Duncan and Spicer and, in terms of San Francisco, he was a
much more engaged public figure. A mandarin populist - with political roots
and associations in the thirties - he was prominent and close to political,
intellectual and social figures. He thrived on the whole dynamic of the City
and wore it like a skin, almost mid-western, and wrote frequently as a
cultural and City critic. I remember a double killing on Waller(drug deal
gone bad) about 1968. He wandered up and down the street, talking to
everyone he knew, visibly upset at the loss of life. By the time he left for
Santa Barbara, he was worn out with the City (or his public timeand
influence had passed), and he retreated to teach and write.
Ironically he wrote very little poetry (to my knowledge) founded in City
materials. His best work is in the Sierra - great love and mystical work,
and occasionally politics. That work - and its great investment in nature -
clearly gave a great sense of permission to Gary Snyder, Philip Whalen, Lew
Welch and others. In his legendary evening fifties' Salons on Scott Street
in the fifties, I suspect his affection for the mountains, also gave similar
permission to the big City guys, Kerouac and Ginsberg, to go "outback"
beyond the boundaries of City. Of course Rexroth's attention, and
translations from the Chinese and Japanese (where is probably found the most
objectivist influence in his work, at least in the Pound sense) also fed the
web of the Dharma pursuits of all.

It is interesting why the Langpo disinterest in his work (tho I suspect Lyn
Hejinian wd not disdain it) - tho Lanpo's view (if there is such a generic
thing) is hardly a reason for Kenneth's dismissal, or a way to re-evaluate
Kenneth's value. (He was notoriously paranoid and his vicious attacks on his
poetic critics and poet contemporaries no doubt were not good career moves).
I suspect disinterest in the work, however, came partly from a reordered
view of nature and its relationship to language, and the whole nature vs
culture arguments. More than I can handle here.  Or maybe it was something
more local. One does easily identify Robert Duncan's world, or Spicer's, as
deeply invested in nature. I don't know if that relates to the homophobia of
the period - the "outback" was not kind to homosexuals (witness James
Dickey's work). The writing zones were much more defined by literary and
relatively safe havens in big cities. Spicer and Duncan's view of "the
forest" was a different one than than "the forest" in Rexroth, Snyder, etc.
Similarly the world of the night, and dreams, has a much greater bearing on
the work of Spicer and Duncan's worlds. Interesting in this regard are
figures are people like Kyger and Harold Dull who feed and are influenced by
both fountains.

In my reading, I would never dismiss Rexroth and his presence here, any more
than I would Duncan and particularly Spicer. And, of course - in terms of
the actual City, Ron's Seventies work (whatever the value of Ketjak and
Tjanting's structural and formal innovations as writing), remains, with that
of Beverly Dahlen and Barry Watten as some of the best we have as genuine
witness and document of life with a deep sense of a daily presence in the
City.

Subject:      Rexroth and "lineage"
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"; format=flowed

The question of Rexroth's influence goes in several directions, and I think
it's worthwhile being a bit careful here. First, I don't think it's true
that "language poets," in general, ignored his work or were ignorant of it.
But who is the "Rexroth" we are talking about? Public intellectual,
second-tier high modernist, anarcho-populist, high humanist, antiwar poet,
one-man Federal Writers Project, translator of classical Chinese and
Japanese poetry, utopian polemicist, flame-throwing book reviewer, etc.?
Rexroth, interestingly, comes undone at numerous faultlines. Did that
multiplicity register as a positive characteristic for anyone encountering
him in the 1970s? Not really.

In fact, I'd go so far to say that the public intellectual/high modernist
faultline, and the less-than-careful public stance, all but made his work
unrecoverable for the New Americans, particularly Duncan in a San Francisco
context. Part of the reception here thus concerns not the Language School
but its immediate forebears. If we turn to a certain Black Mountain poet's
biography, we see some spectacular tension when said poet hit the beach in
the 50s, and that tension only continued through Rexroth's retreat from the
city, when--late 60s, early 70s? I don't have the details but surmise there
is more than enough bad history here to merit its repression. It's all
detailed in Hamalian's biography of Rexroth, and now Fass's of Creeley.

There was a split, precisely, in my own estimation of Rexroth on the public
intellectual/high modernist faultline. I valued his autobiography and Left
public persona, particularly, through the Popular Front period, while I
found his attempts at abstraction--in longer works such as "Prolegomena to
a Theodicy" (which took up many pages of An "Objectivist" Anthology)--to be
energetic failures. But a reading of Rexroth can be constructed between
modernism and the Popular Front, as not perhaps a "regional modernism" but
a "region of modernism." I don't think there was much appreciation among
the Language School of anything like a regional aesthetic, but particularly
after Mike Davis, "California modernism" needs to be defined more precisely.

I don't think Rexroth's eclecticism, self-inflation, or urge to comment
authoritatively on any subject were particularly valuable as models for
language. And indeed these are all character traits one ought to be wary
of. But the attempt to interpret modernism in a public, regional context
might be better recognized in terms of its specific historical moment. That
is task, however, that Duncan's need for an entirely literary genealogy, in
which historical purposes are sublated, would reject.

My suggestion, then, is that the Language School, in general, probably
assumed more of the judgment (and history) of the New Americans than it
would like to admit. Reading Rexroth for his public stance in the 30s was
at least an attempt at a corrective. But the work was too multivalent to
support its own revisionism, at least then. Now--I wonder what can be made
of its multiplicity?

Above & beyond one's particular take on Rexroth, I wonder about this
question of "regionalism," which seems one of the keynotes of Barrett's
post. On the one hand, I can see this as one (of many) relevant approach(es)
toward Rexroth's poetics.  But why, I wonder, do we-- & I'm not necessarily
recusing myself from that "we"-- find this so problematic in Rexroth, while
Spicer's more adamant regionalism doesn't seem to bother us.

It seems to me that there is Regionalism & then there's "regionalism."  The
one being an obvious attempt to hoist "local color" as rationale for
artistic choices; the other an attempt to acknowledge "the local" within an
artistic & intellectual framework that's not limited to region, & thus
(mainly) to anecdotal experience.  I think here not just of Spicer, but even
more primarily of the New York School, and/or of even the aforementioned
West Coast Langpos.

So what do people think of this localist "question"?  Are there different
varieties (or "colors") to this practice, & what are the boundaries at which
we feel it should, as Barrett suggests, be kept at arm's length?  (Or,
another question which I find implicit in Barrett's post: how can we
redefine the local in ways which don't privilege the subjectivist limits of
the terms we're discussing?)

Thoughts on this subject?  Reading lists? ...

Has anyone read anything by Carol Muske  I was at the library and
picked up this book by her, "Married to the Icepick Killer: A Poet in
Hollywood" and opening it at random I read the following lines:

"The house and grounds were a lovely combination of twelfth-century
and contemporary--the original stone lookout tower stood near a large
tiled swimming pool; a luncheon table was set under the olive trees
near the low walls.  Inside, the stones opened into vaulted space,
room after room--upstairs there were bedrooms with views of the
valley and mirrored and marble baths.  Jorie and I talked poetry in
front of the fire and over meals and far into the night."

I couldn't resist, I snatched it away with me!  In this book also she
talks about how one of her novels was optioned by Hollywood and she
got taken to lunch to meet its putative star, Michelle Pfeiffer.
Here I always thought Pfeiffer an extremely intelligent film actress
but this book sets you straight, apparently she, Pfeiffer is dumb as
a post and can't even read "haricots verts" on the menu.

In another chapter Muske tells how she, and many other important US
poets, get invited to the White House to meet Clinton and how he is
tremendously smart and convinced a skeptical audience of poets that
he knows as much about poetry as they do!!!  One poet who was
invited, Hayden Carruth, wouldn't go, citing Clinton's negative
policies and refusing to be the "art that adorns the table of power."
But everyone else invited showed up . . .  I found myself asking
myself, "What would you have done?"  What a fantasy!  But on the
third hand, or first hand, I did love Bill Clinton and he had this
great fantastic supernatural charisma.  Anyhow, I gather from this
book that Muske is a very well known poet and also you pick up here
and there that she runs a Creative Writing Program in LA and got her
masters from SF State and studied with Duncan, Di Prima, Creeley, Kay
Boyle and Nanos Valoraitis.  Does anyone know any of her work?

   Don't kn0w if i got the zeroes right. A gift of this size poured into a
poor and marginal community has to do some good. As we say from this side of
the aisle, it'll trickle down. I think it was a wonderful and thoughtful gift
by a woman moved thru her whole life by poetry as many people outside the
cloistered walls of the small insular po professional community are. It's
great and a magnanamous  act and a paean to the wonders of capitalism and

I'm intrigued by Stephen's take on Duncan and Spicer's nature vs. Rexroth's.
I always thought of Spicer as a city poet, and more particularly a poet who
fed on texts (as in nature reflected in others') much as Trakl apparently
did.  I don't have Spicer's books here but cannot recall a real nature poem*
in the volume.  Please tell us more.  Never a local, Jess.

Rexroth's student put it more bluntly than any other commentators so far.
He believes that Linda Hamalian offered some disturbing news about R.'s
life--i.e. domestic abuse, etc.  and that these biographical points were the
nails in R.'s coffin.  How can Rexroth be part of anyone's canon when
biography and work are so often intermingled in our consideration of a
writer's career?  R. was not and will never be politically correct.   Jess

P.S.  Someone mentioned Robert Hass as a writer influenced by R. Sam Hamil
is also a contender for Rexroth's translation/ Eastern-influence/ mantle.

1. >there is more than enough bad history here to merit its repression.<

Barry's phrase - admittedly here a little de-contextualized is a testy one.
His suggestion to go back into  to Linda Hamalian's biography, A Life of
Kenneth Rexroth, is a salutatory one. (For example, he died in June of 1982
- not 1976, as I said!) However, I still would not say that the apparent
dispersal of Rexroth's public career (which in the waning years was reduced
to pontifical paranoia) is reason to repress exploring the navigational
issues of someone who was trying to incorporate the various waves of
modernism into a regional context. Parallels may also be drawn in looking at
the excesses and some small aesthetic victories of the Taos school of
writers and painters in the teens, twenties and thirties; as well as
similar, though more German based influences on painting and music in Los
Angeles beginning in the early 20's). Rexroth in San Francisco -
particularly in the 30's - was working in a much more politically
radicalized context than either of those two regions.
I would be interested in hearing Barry's thoughts on how Mike Davis' Los
Angeles work reformulates modernist/regionalist ethos, and how it may compel
another way of looking at Rexroth's influence in California - particularly
in the 30's and 40's. Certainly, I also think, these appear to be concerns
in Barry's Detroit identified work. Or any of us whose focus and aesthetics
of the local are a means to a micro-magnification of "the larger picture."

2. As to Spicer and Nature and Jesse's question. I don't want to say nature
is not present as a "real" in Spicer's work, though, it seems to me that
natural artifice is used most frequently as metaphor, as a means of opening
an internal network of psychic and personal associations. It is the branch
that scratches the heart, etc. Though certainly Aquatic Park on the edge of
the Bay was a launching ground from some of the great works, Letters to
Lorca, for example. Those are real Sea Gulls. However, in terms of larger
California as an integral space, I am always momentarily shocked when he
gets as far as Stinson beach, or finds himself in a bar outside Riverside. I
find these as kind of counter-claustrophobic moments in the space of his
work. His containment within very specific spaces I suspect is an issue of
psycho-biography - I suspect part of it goes to an enormous sense of
vulnerability outside the relative safety of his city routines and literary
circle. HOWEVER, to say that he was oblivious to Nature would be stupid.
Apparently he read Robinson Jeffers in depth and I think the following is a
great poem from Language in the terms we're discussing:

   A redwood forest is not invisible at night. The blackness
covers it but it covers the blackness.

   If they had turned Jeffers into a parking lot death would
have been eliminated and birth also. The lights shine 24 hours a
day on a parking lot.

    True conservation is the effort of the artist and the private
man to keep things true. Trees and the cliffs in Big Sur breathe
in the dark. Jeffers knew the pain of their breath and the pain
was the death of a first-born baby breathing.

    Death is not final. Only parking lots.

_______
In 1968, during the demonstrations for People's Park in Berkeley, and three
years after his death, I asked Clifford Burke to print the poem as a
broadside (on green paper) and it was handed out as a free poem on Telegraph
Avenue. Ironically, Graham MacKintosh, Spicer's friend and printer of White
Rabbit Press books, later told me, "Jack would have hated street people." So
there you go. Sometimes you have to liberate poems into the presence of the
public weal, the poet's control - dead or alive -  be damned.

Small Press Traffic presents
Saturday, November 23, 2002 at 3:30 pm
New Experiments: Arielle Greenberg on the Gurlesque
Talk and discussion begins at 3:30, reading at 5:00

Arielle Greenberg writes: "Theorizing that exposure to the second wave of
feminism informed the work of emerging women poets writing today, I invite the
audience to consider with me how contemporary women's poetry has transformed,
complicated and carried on the legacy of feminist art-making. I call this
aesthetic Gurlesque, because of its sensual/sexual liberties, its
carnivalesque syntactical chaos, and its punk-rock riot grrl interest in
brashness and pop culture. Encouraged and fascinated by what seems to be a
zeitgeist that cuts across class, race and regional boundaries, I will talk
about what Gurlesque poetry is, why it's happening, and who is doing it. I
will also discuss the relationship between feminism and the "innovative
imperative," the need to make non-linear, non-narrative work that is
nonetheless grounded in real life experience and material culture."

Greenberg's first book of poems, Given, will be published in November 2002 by
Verse Press. Recent poems appear in American Letters & Commentary, Chain,
Fence, Volt, and Crayon; critical work in Rain Taxi, Electronic Poetry Review
and elsewhere. She is on the editorial board of How2, an online journal of
innovative women's poetics.

The west coast school essay I just wrote for the Oxford Encyclopedia was
a pretty thankless task. I tried to at least indicate how both
southwestern regionalism and middle California regionalism owe at least
some debt to the Chicago Renaissance, Midwestern imagism, and modernism
in Chicago, in which Rexroth did participate.  As a poet and painter.
With Winters (not a painter).

"The story of West Coast School writing is that of a regional literature
becoming a national literature."

"Like William Everson, [Jack Spicer] viewed the west coast as a
landscape that demanded extreme writing."

When you look at the southwestern regionalists, you've got folks (mostly
tubercular) from Chicago (Lewis, Winters, Corbin Henderson) meeting
economic refugees from the bay area (the Klass', Edwin Markham).

Southern California is a completely separate literary region from
either, as perhaps Kevin Killian's Carol Muske posting indicates.  She
was at the John Tranter / Susan Wheeler reading recently, but I have
only heard her recently read the poem about the cocaine addict / eye
surgeon.  Anyhow, here we've got something different, like Helen Hunt
Jackson, who went to school with Emily Dickinson and wrote her letters
even though E.D. was apparently very annoyed by her and her verse.
Helen Hunt Jackson lived in Colorado mostly anyway.  Apparently it is
not necessary to actually live in Southern California to be one of its
regionalist writers; anyway, most of the writers here were or are
national and international writers the regional writers are desperately
trying to be taken for.

I did find a really cool female writer, Jane E. Weeden, who wrote
rhyming catalog poems from the chamber of commerce business listings
here in LA and in SF in the 1900s.  I am writing something about her.
Advertising and boosterism shapes So Cal as a literary region, as Davis
notes.  We are separated from the remainder of the west coast by Santa
Barbara, which has a south-facing beach.  Where Rexroth eventually
moved.

Be well,
Catherine Daly

Launched on Saturday 14th November 2002 at The Voice Box, Royal Festival
Hall, London: _And # 11_

Initially co-edited by Bob Cobbing and John Rowan, AND magazine first
appeared in 1954 - and retrospectively became Writers Forum's first
publication. After a gap of 6 years there were 4 issues in the 1960s, 1 in
the early 70s (WF100), and then an exemplary breather of over 20 years. Four
more issues, which I co-edited with Bob, appeared in the 90s. The new issue,
AND # 11, - for which he designed the cover - was finalised with Bob shortly
before his death; it contains the usual mix of verbi / visi provocations,
with substantial contributions from Sean Bonney, Jeff Hilson, Patricia
Farrell, Scott Thurston, Jennifer Pike, Ulli Freer, Lawrence Upton, Mark
Mendoza, Bruce Andrews and Ralph Hawkins, among others.

Launched on Sunday 15th November 2002 at The Voice Box, Royal Festival Hall,
London: _Skeleton Sonnets_; by Adrian Clarke 80pp; A5 portrait; ISBN 1 84254
068 X; £3.50

Each is available at £3.50 (+ 75p p&p in UK; £1.50 to North America) for
sterling cheque - ask for p& p to other destinations, ask for advice if you
don't have a sterling account

Lewis,

This is great work here. I really like the mouse hold function - at first I
was confused but then it all opened up for me. Really nice sound graphic and
text work.

Best, Geoffrey

The 21st-Century Poetics Working Group happily announces our second event of
the season--

A round-table discussion on the poetics and politics of publishing
featuring

Patricia Dientsfrey, Laura Moriarty, Andrew Maxwell, and Travis Ortiz

Friday, November 22
6:30 p.m. potluck, 8 p.m. presentations and discussion
900 Bancroft Way (at 7th St.)

Patricia, Laura, Andrew and Travis will present their thoughts on current
cruxes in the publishing of poetry, speaking from their varied experiences
in editing and publishing outside of the industry's mainstream.

Patricia Dienstfrey is co-founder of Kelsey St. Press, which has been
publishing experiemental writing by women and collaborations between poets
and visual artists since 1974. Her most recent book, The Woman Without
Experiences (Kelsey St.), was winner of The American Award for Literature,
1996. Her work appears in Moving Borders: Three Decades of Innovative
Writing by Women, edited by Mary Maragret Sloan (Talisman House, 1997). With
Brenda Hillman she is co-editor of The Grand Permission: New Writings on
Poetics and Motherhood, due out from Wesleyan University Press, in the
Spring of 2003.

Andrew Maxwell works as a lexicographer in Los Angeles, CA. With Macgregor
Card he edits the literary magazine The Germ, and hosts the Poetic Research
reading series from the Laboratory in downtown LA. As impoverished
impresario and arts activist in the Bay Area, he acted as curator for the
Flickering Frame Film Society and director of music programming at the radio
station KZSC, where he also produced 92 episodes of an experimental radio
serial called "Outside, My Strange Attractor." His writerly output includes
two poetic "miniatures", The Shrink and The Last Performance, and a
forthcoming chapbook, Window's Arbor. Poems have appeared or are near at
hand from Angle, Skanky Possum, and Elizabeth Robinson's Ether broadside
series. You can catch him locally as moppet percussionist and new music
mallet-horse for the groups Open City and Ensemble of the Thirty-One Birds.

Laura Moriarty runs Small Press Distribution. Her recent books are Like
Roads (Kelsey St. Press), Rondeaux (Roof Books), L'Archiviste (Zasterle
Press) and Symmetry (Avec Books). Her book Persia (Chance Additions) co-won
the Poetry Center Book Award in 1983. She received a Wallace Alexander
Gerbode Foundation Award in Poetry in 1992. Since 1986 she has managed the
American Poetry Archives at the Poetry Center at San Francisco State
University.

Travis Ortiz' first book, geography of parts, has recently appeared from
Melodeon Poetry Systems. Travis is co-editor of Atelos Publishing Project.
He also edits a series of short books of poetry that highlight the visual
aspects of poetry, called ghos-ti- (an indo-european root pronounced
"gaws-tee"). His poems have appeared in Chain, Salt, Mirage #4/Period[ical],
Lyric&, River City. His "text collages," or visual poems, have appeared in
Prosodia and Mirage. He is a contributing editor for Chain's "Different
Languages" issue.


We shower praise upon anyone who helps support the series by bringing food
or drink or by sticking around to help us clean up.

This event is free and open to the public:

21st-Century Poetics vigorously thanks the Townsend Center, the Consortium
for the Arts, the Department of English, and the East Bay Poetics &
Motorcycle Club for their support.

Stay tuned for upcoming events, including:
Thursday, April 20:  Kevin Davies and Judith Goldman

One does tend to forget that New York City is a region ("centrality is the
power of the dominant margin" as Charles Bernstein says somewhere)--and I say
this as a "provincial" myself--until, say, one teaches O'Hara to undergraduates
in Las Vegas....I found myself comparing him to Niedecker precisely as regional
poets, working, Mark, through a set of ideas that seem similar to your two
versions of regionalism in the order you give them......But I wonder if the
case of Spicer differs:  because a specific local set of conditions and a
specific community gave rise to his poetry, does this make it regional?  I'm
curious:  is there poetry important to you that isn't regional, in your second
sense?  (Surely the opposite of the regional would be not the national or
universal, god help us, but something like the "cosmopolitan"--poetry written
precisely in the absense of shared local values.....otherwise "regional"
becomes a code word for "avant-garde," which inevitably evokes the
"mainstream," and we're back to THAT story...)

It's certainly to the point to think of New York as a region, and its
notion of modernism as regionalist. Whenever you hear, I couldn't do this
anywhere else, it is the voice of "region."

To be slightly more serious out it, Heidegger suggests that even the
copula, "X is X," is a "region" of being--a "mere" region, and he's not
interested in regionalism. Such an intractable account, though, does
suggest that a more inclusive notion of regionalism--a kind of critical
regionalism, as experience does tend to take place in such "regions"--might
be helpful in getting past the "old regionalism," which, like the "old
historicism," sees temporal/spatial positivities apart from dominant
metropolitan cultures as regionalist. Nothing could be less the case or
desirable in the globalized, decentered present. We have every reason to
critically modify the old idea of "region" and look for a better account.

The intersections of modernism with such an account of region are many and
various, and I've written on that--so I refer you to:
http://www.markszine.com/102/bwind.htm. Rexroth provides an interesting
case. In his work, we might see a pre-postmodern spatial elaboration of a
modernist aesthetic--so that the dislocation of the various sites of his
writing (or modes or genres) should be taken into the specific geographic
positivity of San Francisco or the West Coast or the Pacific
Rim--additionally a "region" of Rexroth's writing, even though he didn't
reside there (in fact, I believe he did travel to Japan at one time). So
what allows for Rexroth's aesthetics of translation, which are certainly
quite different from, say, Zukofsky's, would be the adequacy of a spatial
notion of "region." There is a lyric condition, realized at a second remove.

We could distinguish, as well, Rexroth's "regional" moment from Spicer's.
With Spicer, there is a considerable reflection on a paradoxical
insufficiency and absoluteness of region. One is only ever in a region,
even if it's the nonsense of "a baseball diamond in the Runcible
Mountains." But this notion of region is a second-order regionalism--a kind
of hyper-regionalism that, in fact, takes us very far away from any realism
of streetcars and closer to a philosophical account of regions of being,
which is all we ever get. The alignment with that kind of reflection and
the positivity of regions is, or could be, the source of some interesting
connections.

Mike Davis's contribution to the theory of regions is the "noir" moment
when the Frankfurt School hit the beach at Santa Monica. It turns out that
LA provided the negativity in buckets for critical theory--and that,
conversely, negativity is as much a part of LA's regionalism as its
tinseled positivity. When Davis started getting lots of critical attention
for this Frankenstein of an argument, that's when new California
regionalism really took off. And its been Davis v. Kevin Starr ever since.

I think they should burn all the extant Poetry copies and start afresh. They
should establish weekly poetry readings at the end of each everyone goes to
the local bar, and the magazine foots the bar and food tab. These will
constitute a good beginning until we think of other ideas.

Perhaps to print them on stainless...

There's also finally the possibility of arming poets - everyone's going
for power these days... 9mms with O'Hara etched on the barrel... haiku-
fragment bombs...

Catherine,  You provide thought-provoking data, but what exactly do you mean by west coast "school"?  School of Jeffers, Winters, Rexroth, Spicer, Duncan, Snyder, James McMichael (a great L.A. poet), and Hass?  I see thematic continuities here -- e.g., nature, human intimacy, utopia/dystopia, the Pacific rim traditions -- but it's a pretty peculiar bunch: and more peculiar, taken as a whole, than anything on the other coast (maybe because of the Californian provincialism?).  I did not know that people had begun talking of a "school"...

ps  Another reason to mope about the academic hegemony: it draws off the local talent thereby eroding the topsoil of regional culture.

A Cultural Hero of the Soviet Era Looks to the Future
Now at Emory, Mikhail Epstein envisions new modes of thought in the
humanities

By PETER MONAGHAN
Atlanta

    the article=20
     http://chronicle.com/free/v49/i13/13a01601.htm

For the past decade, an intellectual and cultural hero from Soviet-era
Moscow has been quietly producing ambitious and varied research here, on th=
e
edge of Emory University's leafy suburban campus, in a converted house that
is the home of the Russian department.
Mikhail N. Epstein, whom the eminent Sovietologist Walter Laqueur has calle=
d
"probably the most important figure in Russian literary theory" of recent
decades, was a fabled figure among Moscow's intelligentsia in the 1970s and
'80s.=20
The fact that he's rarely mentioned in literary and cultural-studies circle=
s
in America "is to the disgrace of the academy," says Thomas R. Epstein, a
visiting professor in Slavic studies at Brown University. He's a friend (no
relation) of Mikhail, but his opinion is echoed by other respected Slavists
with a theoretical bent. The Russian may lack celebrity in part because his
work is so hard to pigeonhole.
As it happens, now is a good time to wander belatedly into Mikhail Epstein'=
s
singular world, thanks to his latest book in translation. The bulk of Cries
in the New Wilderness: From the Files of the Moscow Institute of Atheism
(published this summer by Paul Dry Books) is a mock "spetsizdat," or
classified document, on emerging spiritual sects, purportedly compiled in
1985 by a bureaucrat-scholar, R.O. Gibaydulina, Ph.D.
An atheist per state policy, Gibaydulina records with scientific dispassion
the words of various preachers and prophets. Among the Everyday Sects are,
for example, Thingwrights, who call for "a wholesale replacement of signs b=
y
things." The Philistine Sects include Folls, who disrupt the "rational
projects" of the state. Among the Atheist sects, the Atheans "call upon man
to act as if God exists, even if He doesn't."
Cries in the New Wilderness, says Thomas Epstein, "to paraphrase Voltaire,
creates groups that, if they didn't exist --=A0and they didn't --=A0they would
have to have been created just to fully enact the realities of Soviet life.=
"
It is a summa theologica of groups that tacitly disavow the Soviet disavowa=
l
of religions.
An earlier form of the book circulated in Moscow in the late 1980s as a
classic samizdat --=A0underground --=A0manuscript before an American
Russian-language edition was published in 1993. Its underground status
derived from its wry, knowing humor: Mr. Epstein frames the Gibaydulina
report with mock-scholarly book reviews and a preface (as well as an
afterword, in the English edition) written by Mikhail N. Epstein --=A0or a
character of the same name --=A0who expresses the belief that the "lonely
voices of faith" are relieving the absurd "ideosphere" that gripped
20th-century life. They may even be "making room for a new freedom of
thought which goes under the ancient name of 'wisdom.'"
The entertaining mystification of Cries only begins to suggest the scope of
Mr. Epstein's writing. In Russia, and among alert American colleagues, he i=
s
known for his works on Russian postmodernism and totalitarian language, for
his startling religious and philosophical writings, and for his extensive
Internet projects. His 15 books and hundreds of articles range freely over
historical, linguistic, literary, political, and religious ground.
"Of all the people that I know of in the East or the West who are doing
cultural studies," says Michael Holquist, a professor of comparative
literature and Slavic languages and literatures at Yale University, "he
comes as close as anybody to weaving a seamless web between the different
aspects of culture --=A0high, low, spiritual ... It's the ars combinatoria
that is so remarkable."
'Technohumanities'
On first meeting Mr. Epstein, who is 52, a visitor registers his Old World
manners, his grayed sweep of hair, his steady gaze behind bifocals. But whe=
n
he speaks, in nuanced English that bears only occasional traces of Russian
syntax, concrete reality dissolves in the light of his abstract thought.
His new book, he says, is a "comedy of ideas," his response to a remark by
the French poet and critic Paul Val=E9ry (1871-1945) that the modern era
called for a new "Intellectual Comedy" to succeed Dante's Divine Comedy,
which was born of feudal society, and Balzac's Human Comedy, which sprang
from bourgeois society. The right context for a third "comedy," says Mr.
Epstein, is surely the rise and fall of Communism --=A0a regime that sought t=
o
make ideology reality.
Cries is part of an attempt to create "a whole branch of what I call
technohumanities" --=A0a practical application of ideas to the humanities tha=
t
he finds analogous to technology in the natural sciences and politics in th=
e
social sciences. To the ancient Greeks, he points out, techne meant "art."
In his book, he says, "I see some nascent religious and philosophical modes=
,
but I try to articulate them to such a degree that they become philology,
the theoretical consciousness of these groups. This is the artistic
component."
He also increasingly favors another mode of the book --=A0the catalog of
ideas, or encyclopedia: "I think this is the form for the comedy of our
time."
"I feel myself not very in favor of consecutive writings," he says. "I feel
this is a matter of the past, more and more, and I myself prefer what can b=
e
called hypertextual connections, parallel processing of variations of the
same problem in several disciplines and languages."
After all, he continues, "time tends to evaporate in the contemporary world=
,
and I think that our intellectual enterprise should somehow reflect that
tendency."
Cries is part of a projected trilogy, another part of which is posted on
InteLnet, his complex of Web sites
(http://www.emory.edu/INTELNET/Index.html).
The posted portion is called the Book of Books --=A0"a little pretentiously, =
I
know," Mr. Epstein says, and is a growing compendium of ideas that diverge
from paradigms in the humanities. He explains on the site: "Practically
every generally accepted decision that is made in the humanities
(philosophy, literature, ethics, linguistics) leaves room for an alternativ=
e
yet unexpressed decision." Those theories and concepts "were never conceive=
d
and realized ... because they failed to find their exponents," in some case=
s
because they were thwarted by "persecutions, totalitarianism, destruction o=
f
culture, of philosophy, of theology."
"To tell you the truth," Mr. Epstein says, "my favorite intellectual
occupation is inventing new disciplines, new methods." The Book of Books is
full of proposals for such disciplines, for new genres and concepts, and fo=
r
new words to describe them. "Semionics," for example, would be the science
of "how to produce new signs," and "silentology" the inverse of linguistics=
.
"This," he continues, "is what actually the humanities' enterprise may be:
finding mutenesses and lacunae in the languages of existing disciplines and
trying to fill them."
Postmodern on Its Own Terms
That reverie in some ways reveals the Russian tradition from which Mr.
Epstein springs: that of the literary critic straddling the border of
literature and philosophy.
In Moscow, Mr. Epstein made his biggest theoretical splash in the mid-1980s=
,
when he presented the startling idea that the Soviet Union was postmodern
--=A0and that it (and, earlier, Russia) had been so even before the concept
was coined in the West.
How could there be postmodernism when modernism itself had been so
suppressed in the Soviet state? Well, he said, because in Russian culture,
ideology --=A0specifically, socialist realism, a compromised Marxism --=A0stood
in for the two underpinnings of postmodernism in its Western formulation:
the "cultural logic of late capitalism," as Fredric Jameson put it, and the
"tyranny" of visual simulation and hyperreality, as described by Jean
Baudrillard.
The argument was all the more striking because the Russian humanities, whil=
e
strong in such areas as textual studies and literary history, had avoided
such galvanizing Western theories as poststructuralism, deconstruction, and
psychoanalysis, writes Caryl Emerson, a highly regarded Slavist at Princeto=
n
University, in a recent essay in the journal Common Knowledge.
Mr. Epstein stood out in Russian academe thanks also to his after-hours
activities. He held academic day jobs, beginning in the mid-1970s at
Moscow's Institute of World Literature. But at night, he was associating
with artists and writers, in a world that in Russia is traditionally set
apart from academe. In particular he championed the Conceptualists, who use=
d
such elements as everyday objects, garbage, and blasphemy to produce
shocking, anti-aesthetic art that showed how ideology infects independent
thought. The group represented concepts, rather than objects, to show that
in an ideocratic society, as Mr. Epstein puts it, "everything was
ideologically infused and abused." In the Conceptualists, he located a
parallel to a key ingredient in postmodernism: irony.
As the Soviet state staggered toward its dissolution in the 1980s, Mr.
Epstein organized activities in Moscow that might, playfully but seriously,
help build alternatives to Soviet ideocracy. He formed such groups as the
Essayists Club, Image and Thought, and --=A0the most celebrated --=A0the
Laboratory of Contemporary Culture, in which intellectuals and artists
attempted to cross political, intellectual, and cultural borders --=A0those
set, for example, by the language of totalitarianism.
The attention he attracted caught up with him. As Sovietism petered out and
economic hardships racked the state, nationalists of the Pamyat' movement
took to harassing Mr. Epstein at his public appearances. "I received some
threats, and there were some publications against my being a Russian writer
with a Jewish name. My wife was afraid. When she tried to obtain food for
our four children, she was threatened because she was the wife of a Jew. Yo=
u
understand."
He moved to the United States in 1990, teaching for a semester at Wesleyan
University, then working as a research fellow at the Woodrow Wilson
International Center for Scholars, in Washington, before settling at Emory.
His arrival in America caused great excitement among theory-oriented
American Slavists, says Dale E. Peterson, a professor of English and Russia=
n
at Amherst College. Mr. Peterson hoped --=A0perhaps too optimistically, he
says now --=A0for "the kind of really complicated cultural dialogue that has
happened as, say, Western feminism has had to encounter alternative
formulations of feminist positions."
'Age of Anticipation'
One of Mr. Peterson's expectations did bear fruit. "I was anticipating to
find that while poststructuralist thinking in the West came largely out of
an age of suspicion, of decentering of self, and, through deconstruction, o=
f
pointing out the indeterminacy of meaning, poststructuralist thinking in
Epstein's case and generally in the post-Soviet period comes out of an age
of anticipation."
Mr. Epstein agrees. In one of his central formulations, he suggests that
while postmodernism may assert the death of time, history, authorship,
originality, and God, "the epoch of deconstruction, demythologization, and
so on is over." After an epoch of "post-" --=A0poststructuralism,
postmodernism --=A0he says, we are entering an era of proto-, of "feeling as
if we are at the very beginning of some new trends and tendencies that we
are not yet able to preview or forecast, but we have to try."
Such an era would complete a drift in Western philosophy from the indicativ=
e
mode (pre-Kantian thinkers describing what is), to the imperative mode
(Kantian and post-Kantian thinkers describing what should be), to a
now-emerging epoch of the subjunctive mode, the mode of possibility.
"All these tendencies to the imperative mode are exhausted," he says. "In
the fall of Russian Communism, the activist approach is over, and in
deconstruction, the critical thrust of Western thought also is exhausted.
The epoch of the third mode, the subjunctive mode, is at the very beginning=
,
and we should try to create aesthetics, ethics, metaphysics, some social an=
d
theological aspects of this new epoch."
Mr. Epstein discusses what that future might look like in The Philosophy of
the Possible: On Modalities of Culture and Thought, published in Russian
last year, and now under contract to be published in English. The book
expresses "the most interesting thing about Epstein: He's just really
optimistic," says Princeton's Ms. Emerson, "not naive."
His optimism resounds in his current work on the future of the humanities a=
s
a fellow of Emory's Center for Humanistic Inquiry, and in his development o=
f
InteLnet. In both undertakings, he emphasizes the benefit of new modes of
thinking: mystery and amazement. With Conceptualist self-parody, he says hi=
s
goal on the Web site is "to link everything to everything else," to see wha=
t
"mysteries" emerge.
Mystery is at the core of his fascination with spiritualism, particularly
with the Rus-sian tradition of "apophaticism," an elusive concept that
emphasizes human inadequacy and might be described as godless godfulness, o=
r
a questing for a God who is an absence.
Mr. Epstein's emphasis on possibility is thorough. Toward his goal of new
ways of thinking, he advocates the free, nonproprietary sharing of ideas.
His colleagues compliment him on that unusual generosity, but they also
wonder if it is too utopian.
Ellen E. Berry, an English professor at Bowling Green State University who
co-wrote a 1999 book with Mr. Epstein on Russian and American styles of
"creative communication," says: "We used to tussle quite a bit over his
tendency to not see that this open interaction could sometimes lead to
violence, to the negation of the other's point of view. For someone who's
lived through violence, his thoughts don't turn to the possibility of
violence and even, if you will, of evil."
Take also Mr. Epstein's simple theory of "transculture," which holds that
while any society tends to be a trap, one can, through culture, liberate
oneself. Contrary to Lenin's remark that "one cannot live in a society and
be free of it," Mr. Epstein argues that "culture is not a product of
society, but a challenge and alternative to society."
Not only Lenin, of course, but also Freud, Foucault, and even Bakhtin
--=A0whose shadows loom large in American humanities departments --=A0were less
sanguine about the possibilities of escaping society's shackles.
That may begin to explain why, as Mr. Peterson of Amherst College puts it,
"the splashdown effect of Epstein in the American intellectual world has no=
t
been as large as I had hoped."
Now, Mr. Peterson says, "the time is either overdue, or ripe. It's hard to
say."
He and other advocates of Mr. Epstein's work cite additional reasons for hi=
s
relative obscurity. For one thing, among the last of the philologists, most
Slavists are suspicious of "theory." For another, translations of his works
into English have been slow in coming, not because of the difficulty of his
Russian prose, which his translators call lapidary, but because of the
unusual nature of his work.
The West has always been slow to pick up on Eastern European thought, often
discovering it only through, say, a French lens, says Mr. Holquist. "In the
American academy, anything that comes from east of the Seine is somehow not
considered quite serious."
But Mr. Epstein's ability to glide from academe to beyond is unusual, even
among Russian thinkers, says the Yale professor, and that confounds America=
n
academics. "By any standard," sums up Mr. Holquist, "Mikhail is a real
original."

A NIGHT OF POETRY WITH SIMON PETTET

"Like Beethoven's Bagatelles, Simon Pettet's short poems have a great deal to
say, and their seemingly modest dimensions help rather than hinder his saying
it.  An unorthodox lucidity reminiscent of Schuyler, a certain English
dappleness and an oriental concision blend in poetry whose sweet, complex
fragrance is Petter's secret."  -- John Ashbery

"... poems like large beads with words deeply carved in them ... and so the
beads turn from wood to gem in this light: a New York light cast on English
speech (English light cast on New York speech?).  Perfect poems,
unexpectedly."  -- Alice Notley

Maybe not burn them! But the bar idea is good! I think the donation is good
(if used properly) (the guesture is good): I once sent a poem to Poetry (I
had the Poet's Market) but the editor didnt comment except to say that he
was very very busy which I can understand...but that aside I only sent as it
was one amongst many including what looked like "cutting edge" to me (there
are not so many in NZ)...but the paradox is that while I am now on a quite
low income and have to watch costs and so on and dont have much time to
write: I only wish I had more time to read and write...the paradox is that I
KNOW that I dont want any money from anyone....NOW: if someone sent me a
cheque would I refuse....no...but I wouldnt ask for money and I never have
(except I did when my mother was quite ill and house bound and our outgoings
were double our income I asked the family to help) but I dont think that
money to individuals does any good......well, I'll alter that, I think it
would be good if Poetry distributes the money and starts grants into a wide
range of poets and styles (not just Billy Collins etc) and grants for
students....but for myself I know that a large amount of money _given_ to me
is not what I want: I believe that part of what makes a poet/writer/artist
is the strength to go on in the face even of possible banckruptcy (from
which I'm not too far!!) and at times I have been anxious about money...the
thing is that the old person who donated the money was probably a kind
person...but kindness can kill: this is different to say the US starting
real development in foreign countries that are oor and need growth [(rather
than the present policy of bullying and bombing)] (no strings and so on)
... in some ways its good...but in other ways it shows the falsity and
gaucheness of capitalism not its glory as Harry Nudel exclaims (Harry you
forgot your durn...)...no US Capitalism is no better than any other
capitalism: lives are ruined then peole thnk thaey dcan palm off and maybe
get to heaven...ok maybe this individual is a good person she probably is...

Dont worry I like cash: but I like eanring my own and I dont admire people
because they have money - or they are famous, or they are "geniuses" - and I
never expect any money for poetry I write and (others may wish to have it)
although I accept it if its there....

I dont know: the guesture is probably good .... I wouldnt be cynical about
it: but it makes me think that happiness comes not from external awards but
from an innner sense of worth in what one is: I feel that to have brought up
three chlildren, to have lived a fairly interesting (if "ordinary") life,
mainly had good health, still feel quite good, have confidence in myself, in
others, know I will die one day recognised or not but have had a good
"innings" as they say. (Even if I had done noting I would still feel ok one
cant live in the past or the future). Its good to be 54 and alert and talk
to a beautiful Chinese woman down the road at her coffee shop about the
significance of the eagle to her and other Chinese people  (from where she
comes from) and ask her about her langauge and her life and hear her say how
cats are gentle animals and eagles are strong and then to go out and see
children shouting and jumping around and seeing the trees and hearing bird
song and puzzling out some of the ideation on Ron's blog and playing Chess
and reading and thinking: even just being able to see....money cant buy
those things...money cant buy contact and breath and  being alive and being.
And here there is no war: there are problems but we are not at war.

But I have to say I dont think (from memory) that Poetry was very
interesting in comparison to many many other poetry mags in the US and NZ
and elsewhere...and including BRIEF (NZ) - in which I have been published a
few times: and also Poetry New Zealand and even a small mag in Chicago PICA
(which seems to have disappeared or  whatever) which took some of my prose
poems....often of course one has to see a number of copies and  to get a
good sense of a mag.....is Sulfur still going? I picked one up recently: I
must get some copies of Chain that sounds good....it would be good if some
of that cash goes to the smaller mags and other than the "official" poets.

I would hate to have to bring up children now on a low income but I think
apart from tose thigs we all  need to realise that life is a struggle: each
ash his own kempf....thatis what life is a constant struggle but it is also
exciting and all the other things: money as such isnt the answer....I like
to earn my own way. That is my belief:  that life is an interesting
struggle.

UbuWeb is pleased to announce the first phase of a new section of Ethnopoetics curated by
Jerome Rothenberg: an overview of world poetries, poetics, and theory. UbuWeb
Ethnopoetics contains a wealth of examples: visual, oral and written.

"The breakthroughs of the last 100 years in poetry and elsewhere have been marked by new
approaches to language and performance. Largely this has been the work of several
generations of experimental writers and performers, many of them now archived and
available thru Ubuweb and related web sites. It fell to some of us, starting with
forerunners like Tristan Tzara and Antonin Artaud, to track related but traditional
approaches over a wide range of once impenetrable cultures throughout the world. In my
own work I was able to bring some of these lines together in gatherings of the 1960s and
1970s like Technicians of the Sacred and Shaking the Pumpkin, as well as in the magazine
Alcheringa that I co-edited for several years with Dennis Tedlock. The name that we gave
this enterprise, as it applied to the world’s deep cultures – those surviving in situ as
well as those that had vanished except for transcriptions in books or recordings from
earlier decades – was ethnopoetics.

In the present Ubuweb collection of ethnopoetic openings, it’s our intention to build a
sampler of what we take to be the second great breakthrough of the modernist poetry
project. The search here is for a range of poetries outside the domain of customarily
accepted literature. In particular we’re interested, in the spirit of other segments of
Ubuweb, in soundings and visionings that are the traditional and often culturally
acceptable counterparts to what in our own surroundings have been seen and heard as
radical, even disturbing departures from conventional practice. In exploring these we
will also be mindful of occasions on which the avant-garde experimental line has merged
with or deliberately drawn from other culturally specific traditions.

We proceed in the spirit of Gertrude Stein, often quoted by me: The exciting thing about
all this is that as it is new it is old and as it is old it is new, but now we have come
to be in our way which is an entirely different way."

Barry: Thanks for all these interesting configurations re LA, Germans &
Spicer. A new term (?) such as "meta-regional" may mean something in terms
of work happening within a region but simultaneously transcending it as a
meta-critique that transmits a validity on a global level. (Hong Kong -
films- and Tokyo - graphics - probably also are or will achieve claim as
similar sources of a "meta-regional/ cultural critique"). In the Davis case
- as I think you suggest- it is a Los Angeles that jumps out of Los Angeles=
.
City of  Quartz a refreshing quantum breach of Kevin Starr's informative,
but tradition framed narrative record/analysis. Spicer's San Francisco
Giant's "Diamond" is multi-valent and does and does not have a relationship
with the play on the actual field.  Rexroth's campsite and trees and leaves
in the Sierra remain such and as such are a space for erotic and religious
illumination and meditation.

A frustration: I can't get the Marks site to open up your essay - on my
screen there does not seem to be a forward sign into the prose. Stan
Douglas' great collapsed house photo is all I get. Where Kit Robinson's
poems are accessible. I.e., is there some help here?

Hi Nick,

>But I wonder if the

>specific community gave rise to his poetry, does this make it regional?

Spicer was obviously California-centric in his views of politics & culture.
He attempted to prevent _J_ and _Open Space_ magazines and the publications
of White Rabbit Press from being distributed outside the Bay Area.  I think
he also claimed to want California to break off from the rest of the U.S. &
form its own independent republic.  He admired Vachel Lindsay, who certainly
was more of a regionalist in my first sense than Spicer was-- precisely
because of his California aesthetic.  (I don't have the bio at hand, but I'm
sure others, or Kevin K himself, could expand on these points).

The ~work~ of course is something else-- surely it's not limited to
regionalism in the narrow (first) sense.  But this is precisely the sort of
distinction I was trying to get at by the more expansive (second) sense of
the term I suggested.  I really don't see how Spicer ~doesn't~ fit the term
in that sense.  Perhaps, Nick, you could expand on your point.  (I also
don't see-- to respond to Jesse Glass-- how the term "regionalism"
necessarily implies an interest in nature as a theme in one's poetry.  So
yes I would agree: New York City is a "region" too).

You make an interesting point, which I hadn't really thought about.  Yes,
many poets important to me can be seen as "regional" in the second sense.
However, there are some cases where it doesn't seem clear to me that
"regional" is a relevant starting point: Stein, Loy, Artaud, Mac Low,
Coolidge, and even Ashbery (despite his NY School pedigree) come to mind.

And yes, what would the opposite of regional be?  Not universal-- certainly
not.  Maybe "national" in the glib, fake sense that smoothes over the
differences-- kind of like the respective nonregional "accents" of media
announcers in the U.S. & U.K.  To me the word regional doesn't necessarily
imply community, so I think your take on "cosmopolitan" is actually closer
to my second/more expansive sense of regional.  Do we really want a poetry
that reflects shared values?  Whose values?  Bound to be those of Dana Gioia
& Billy Collins in some way, UNLESS we insist on those regionalist
differences/regions of difference (a.k.a. Temporary Autonomous Zones).

Good talking to you,

Mark

In case you think we need homeland security, note that it's already
been addressed. Just think what 100 million could do to shore up the
"tradition" of poetry. This from a wonderful interview with a
poet-editor:

interviewer: Are all editors acquiring editors?

poet-editor: There are some in-house editors that do more manuscript
editing and copyediting, but in most trade houses editors do acquire
books. Most of it is through agents now. With the whole anthrax
scare, people are less inclined to be reading unsolicited manuscripts.

not my school -- so I defined it against the NYS (there's considerable
cross-pollination) -- which I also wrote as a regionalism -- a group of
poets at a place and time, & that New American... is a regionalist
anthology which was particularly bad at capturing the "unnamed fifth
school."

Rexroth did some of the Coit Tower murals.

Everson has Markham through Rexroth, incl. Jeffers, obviously

Lee Bartlett has Everson, McClure, Rexroth, Duncan, Snyder, Gunn, Tarn,
Palmer, and the (male) west coast language poets

I used "Chinese menu of themes" for several reasons; one is to counter
the "bunch o' white guys syndrome".  Utopia / dystopia without LA is
pretty darned impossible.

Michael Davidson includes the female west coast language poets & Hass,
but let's face it, except for him and for LACMA (which, isn't the
exhibit-based poetry curated from across the street?), nobody's devoted
enough attention to women in CA.  Mexican-American poets and African
American poets?  Pacific Rim poets?  Forget about it.  Biggest problem
focusing on Bay area and Reed:  Acker.  Another annoying problem:
Roethke.  Really, everything south of Santa Barbara and north of
Portland isn't on this west coast, which is a distinct geographic area.

There are about five regions in CA:  desert, "self identified working
class" (Davis' Fontana together with the imperial valley), and
borderlands would be my adds to So Cal and Bay area.  Northern CA,
Sierras, etc. always get elided since they're not populous.

'An Apple Fell in the Night and a Wagon Stopped' from Ploughshares???
Please.  A local slam poet (Rick Lupert) uses OC as a trope for
self-referentiality.

Haggis, the Food of Poets (Well, One Scottish Poet)

By WARREN HOGE

EDINBURGH, Nov. 14 — Consider the haggis and you may well wonder how it
inspired a rhapsodic poem, became Scotland's national dish and touched off
an incipient rebellion when Britain's food safety office hinted that it
might ban it.

Swaddled tightly in the yellowed stomach lining of a sheep, a mixture of
congealed fat, onions, pinhead oatmeal, stock and the cut-up heart, lungs
and liver of the animal has a lumpen look that even the eulogizing poet,
Robert Burns, compared to the sight of bare buttocks.

....



mmmmm....

Take the Fast Track to Success


Falling in love Would be nice
                   or Better be

After all the Ridiculous pomp and Hype

Persons with Schizophrenia and their mothers
                     are sought for Predictions

into the caustic souls of their Doctors
                     And I seek a woman

with many of the Answers in her jeans

Focus irises on parts of the eye and some
                  Kind of Gorgeous flower

While on autopilot, Ease back into chatter
                         that precludes conversation
                        And encourages further

Outbursts, persons with mothers sought

for schizophrenic Photographs beside calm
                       Reflecting Pools

if the Stink of rebirth does you in

You'll never chart the Stars in all their Gory
                                 detail, or be Sought

by doctors for Blood or visits at home

I've come to Conquer your shores and
                         Kiss your Schizos

Confident of balance and Collapse

Falling in love Would be better than
falling off the Citgo sign and into
the dirty Charles

Ease back into the Only voice that matters
The one that's Telling you    Jump!

What starts as a Happy accident Always

Snap to your own Personal borders
And find that you've been abandoned

by the Best and brightest of the new
                   Millennium, so long
                   you backstabbers

And beside Boats rowed ashore We
                find several Root causes

                defaced in Recent days

Kiss me I'm panicking and inside
                Interiors the barking

Don't ever quit, not even a bit

Read it back to me in Khmer, every Hollow
                       *minute*

I dumped you Years ago at the mall

which entitles me to an Orange Julius
                and never Having to see

You cry again, you shoulda read what
                you were Signing

Can't wait to get as Stoned as Medusa

And ponder the perspectives of Modern
dizziness

Become chronic in our Bedrooms and

All--

I saw that article, too.  It was funny, despite the undercurrent of
condescension.  Anyway, Charles comes off better than the subject of
Weingarten's last foray into the arts, the Linda Lerman Dance Ensemble, a
local modern dance group.  Lerman had just won a MacArthur grant to continue
her dance projects using both professional dancers and people from the
community.  Weingarten chose to highlight a dance in which people were
invited to bring their pet dogs and dance along with them.  It may indeed
have been a silly and artistically pointless dance (or it may have been
great), but it was the only part of a large ongong project that he  focused
on.  Maybe to write humor you just have to distort things, in small or large
ways.

Ditto about the illustration.  Now I really want to see the actual high
school yearbook photo!

It's amazing to think that Poetry now has a larger literary arts budget than
the annual NEA and NEH literary contributions combined.

Perfect fit though. A friend reminds me to take solace knowing that the
lines appearing therein are now subsidized by Prozac.

Andrew -

Prozac, that drug with blastantly false statistics about health hazards .... brought to you by the company who brought you the drug developed under George HW Bush's direction, the one that can permanently erase your sex drive (try taking it for two years, and see how your sex drive is two years after that, and then see if anyone else has had the same experience; problems are certainly more frequent than the reported double blind rate of less than 5%.

And Lily (coincidentally?  lok at their contributions to the bush campaign) is the company now receiving special exemptions for drug safety under the new Homeland Security Act.  yes, that's right, these right wing zealot thieves have cronied their way into using Lily vaccinations on US military, and those vaccinations are exempted from ANY medical testing.  That is to say, if we invade Iraq, the Bush clan could just use Lily as a conduit to give some soldiers some sort of biological warfare disease claimed to be "vaccines."  then when the american public asks about evidence of saddam's weapons of mass destruction, the bush and psycho-righties can just hold up the diseased soldiers as "evidencde" of saddam's crimes.  i mean they need evidence, since we live in a democracy and all.  at least for now, at least in part, a democracy.

so the question is, when you buy poetry, do you somehow endorse george bush? homeland security?  will reading the journal now pose a threat to your sex drive?  to your ability to stabilize your moods over the long haul?  and if prozac induces insomnia, will reading Poetry after the bequest suddenly cease to put countless readers to sleep as it has done for so long?  (except of course for those of you here who have been published in poetry; your poem was certainly not soporific).


The third paragraph may or may not be more ludicrous than the other two.  only the latter involved a deliberate attempt at humor.

(i was dying to use "soporific" ever since a kindly old man with a rare case of genital rosacea whispered it in my ear recently.)

You can't murder the worth of flowers. I can,
but I tried your shadow on my shoulders once;
it was as snug as breathing in winter through
a haze of amorousness. Like a spray of

bolting the door against locking the phone in
my room (you wouldn't pay for faces to trip
over a fusion of gallery flames, eh?),
you nail down the corners of the vestibule

to keep everything in place, to avoid the
seasonal rift that tips petal-colors one
way, petal-silhouettes the other; sit down,
beauty queen, and stitch the real back together

*LULLABY for DREAMLAND
As one of the first communities of its kind in the North, Lawnside, New
Jersey was the back-drop for the story of African-Americans in the state. At
the hub of this area was a series of clubs that entertained those from as far
away as New York and Maryland with some of the greatest jazz musicians of the
time.  At the epi-center of this vital community during the Jim Crow era and
beyond was the cafe-club, Dreamland.  This photo exhibition documents many of
the people and entertainers who frequented Dreamland.

Buffpo Comrades,

(Pardon the crossposting.)

If you live in NYC, I'd like to see you this weekend.  I'm reading at the
Red Room on Friday night (http://meaningless.com/redroom/) -- Patrick
Herron will be in attendance!! -- and at Ear Inn on Saturday afternoon
(http://home.nyc.rr.com/earinnreadings/readings-nov02.htm) and at Knitting
Factory's Alterknit Theater on Sat. evening at 6
(http://www.knittingfactory.com/).

But don't come to the Saturday events--- your time would be better spent
seeing the gang at the Bowery Poetry Club from 4-7
(http://www.alienated.net/article.php?sid=463).


In person,

The Dimpled Dandy.

built, his shrine to past lovers, bookcases, all the comfortable details.  I=
t=20
was all fascinating to me, as I was just about to do my own place.  I was=20
affected the idea of buying art and can't wait til I'm able to fall in love=20
with a piece and have it hanging on my now-bare walls.  We talked about art=20
and began, naturally,  to talk about writing.  By the time we settled in his=
=20
office, lined with books, a couple comfortable chairs, we'd had an hour's=20
worth of conversation.  When the tape ran out, the conversation continued=20
longer into the night.

JC:  Pete!  Get out of there!

MR:  Oh, you have a Pete.  I have a Jack.

JC:  Now what were we talking about?

MR:  You were talking about your piece =93Ace of Hearts.=94  You wrote a sec=
ond=20
piece from that?

JC:  It started out as a poem and became a short story.  Somehow I gained=20
control of the story form.  It was total magic to me, because I had never=20
written what I considered to be a successful short story at that point in=20
time.  The form had eluded me.  I thought that it was my simply not having=20
the kind of mind that was disciplined in the right way to master that genre,=
=20
even though I had wanted to, and even though I had attempted to.  But=20
somehow, taking on the subject of fatal beauty with terrier-like=20
determination pushed it through to a successful conclusion.  And out of that=
=20
I learned how to do it.  And I sat down with the stories I had written in th=
e=20
80=92s and 90=92s and reworked them until they were successful.

MR:  So what ended up happening with them?

JC:  Two of them were published.  One of the things I came to realize is tha=
t=20
it=92s harder to publish fiction than poetry because with poems you just pri=
nt=20
them out on your printer and send them off.  But with a short story you=92ve=
=20
got twenty or thirty pages, and you have to go to the copying place, you=92v=
e=20
got to get the copies made, and it=92s this whole involved process of actual=
ly=20
getting the work out.  And when it comes to doing that anyway I=92m very laz=
y=20
and unmotivated.  My energy kind of shuts down at the point where I consider=
=20
the work to be completed.  I mean, if I read it to someone else and they get=
=20
excited, that=92s good but--

MR:  Yeah, I hate the mechanics of it.  I completely lose interest too.  The=
=20
thrill of getting published just isn=92t that great for me.  To keep going=20
through this process, it=92s such a gruelling process.  Not even just gettin=
g=20
the copies made and sending them out, and keeping the records, but when you=20
finally get something accepted it=92s another year before you see it again.=20=
=20
And I just don=92t get that thrill other people seem to get from seeing thei=
r=20
work in print.  I love writing.  I like doing readings because it=92s immedi=
ate=20
and it=92s intimate, but I don=92t get the thrill from publishing.  I finall=
y get=20
the magazine and open it up and say, =93Oh yeah, there I am.=94

JC:  It=92s so anticlimactic, it=92s so over.  You don=92t even want to care=
, and=20
sometimes someone will say, =93Hey I saw your poem published.=94  And I thin=
k=20
=93What poem where?=94  There are poems I don=92t even remember writing.  Th=
ey=92re=20
lost, they=92re gone.

MR:  At that point you=92ve taken them out of your =93A Pile=94 and they=92r=
e still=20
out there being considered for some magazine somewhere.

JC:  (laughs)  And you say to them, =93HEY!  I don=92t even remember writing=
=20
those!=94

MR:  (laughs)  I know, I know.  I=92m finding now that there=92s some other=20=
goal=20
with all this.

JC:  What would you say it is?  Can you define it?

MR:  The real joy of writing.  That moment where the piece is complete, and=20
you read it over and it=92s good, and it feels good, that is what cannot be=20
duplicated in any other endeavor except another kind of artistic endeavor. =20
You can=92t get that kind of satisfaction anywhere else.  I=92m getting into=
 this=20
idea that you do your work, you have some exchange about it, and see what=20
happens with it.  And just letting go of it after it=92s written.  My best=20
coups have been people coming to me and asking me to use my work.  And when=20
it happens, great, I love when someone asks to use my work, otherwise I=92m=20
more interested in writing and having some exchange.  I=92m liking the=20
self-publishing thing, I=92m liking that a lot.  It=92s not worth it, climbi=
ng=20
the ladder, saying, =93Oh this is my best poem, it should be in the New York=
er.=20
 This is my second best poem, this should be in the Kenyon Review,=94 you kn=
ow.

JC:  I used to think it was some kind of weird mimicking of the whole ethos=20
of consumer culture, but then the more I thought about it the more I realize=
d=20
that it=92s more basic than that, that it=92s about vanity, and this whole n=
otion=20
of having to receive attention and create this image of yourself that=92s=20
something separate from who you really are.  All because you think you=92re=20
brilliant, or prolific, or have insight.

MR:  And also this notion that you are in a certain journal because you are=20=
a=20
better writer than all these other poets, which is kind of a mean-spirited=20
approach.

JC:  I=92ve been in both the literary world and the corporate world at the s=
ame=20
time.  The corporate ethos borders on the pathological.  There are people wh=
o=20
will do anything to advance their career, which could be eclipsed in a momen=
t=20
by the whim of someone else.  But they buy into this weird game, and it=92s=20=
the=20
same kind of process that=92s happening in the literary world, and basically=
=20
for the same reasons.  They get swept up by the challenge of accomplishing=20
something that will make themselves look better than the people around them.=
 =20
And they=92re driven to expend more and more energy in the pursuit of that=20
goal.  Which, I suppose if it produces really great literature, is perfectly=
=20
valid, but in most cases it doesn=92t seem to.

MR:   There just doesn=92t seem to be a cause and effect there.  The quality=
 of=20
literature--

JC:   --compared to the amount of energy expended in the direction of=20
ambition.

MR:   Yeah.  What=92s really the value of writing?  Especially writing poetr=
y. =20
Seriously, what is the value of it?  I don=92t even know.  It=92s something=20
intangible that is there for me.  And I feel kind of blessed, because I know=
=20
it=92s not there for everybody.  Most people aren=92t hungry for it, don=92t=
=20
appreciate it, don=92t need it.  The value of it for me is that it=92s there=
 for=20
me, and that I feel connected.  It=92s something I can do, with a product at=
=20
the end.  It encapsulates things.  I can use it to different ends personally=
.=20
 If I have something that=92s bothering me, something I just keep walking=20
around with....  Like, I think I e-mailed you about the thing that happened=20
with my car.  I just keep telling people this fucking story, this annoying=20
story and it doesn=92t work to just talk about it.  But then I think I=92ll=20=
tell=20
someone else and it will get better.  But the truth is, if I use that energy=
=20
to write, it may not make a great poem, but, hey, it works.  Then there are=20
these deeper issues I walk around with that bother me, and at times I=92ve b=
een=20
able to take them and make it into a poem, make it into a thing that=92s in=20
some way pleasing.  Something I can hold in my hands and put it down, and=20
it=92s done.

JC:   I have this book downstairs called the Mentor Book of Major American=20
Poets which I shoplifted from the Stamford Museum & Nature Center, in=20
Stamford, Connecticut, when I was twelve.

MR:  (laughs)  I=92LL KEEP AN EYE ON YOU IN MY STORE!

JC:   (laughs)  This kid next door shot a bee-bee into it from back when I=20
stole it in 1965 or 1964.  I don=92t even know why I stole it.  Probably=20
because 95=A2 was a lot of money if you were twelve years old in 1965.  I me=
an,=20
35=A2 would buy you a Dr. Pepper and a Ring Ding, you know, so why waste mon=
ey=20
on a book, right?  So I took this book home, and I opened it up, and it=20
immediately felt like I was reading sacred text.  And I remember one of the=20
first things I read was a section of =93The Bridge=94 by Hart Crane.  It was=
=20
about what was behind his father=92s cannery works, and the hobos back there=
=20
with fires at night.  And I of course had no idea at that time what was goin=
g=20
on with Hart Crane, or modernism.  But I could read the 19th century poets,=20
and I was completely drawn to this.  Nobody had ever prompted me, and I was=20
certainly not encouraged to do this.  Nobody I knew was interested in it, an=
d=20
my parents thought it was odd.  So it=92s almost as if I was moving by=20
instinct.  I was kind of like how the birds are when they need to make the=20
nest.  It=92s not a thought thing, it=92s sort of feeling, well okay, I=92ll=
 do=20
this--

MR:  --it=92s there for you.  It=92s there for everybody, but it opens up to=
 you.

JC:   I had an instant connection to it.  There were all these poems I=20
couldn=92t read back then, I didn=92t know what the hell they were about.  B=
ut=20
then I had a weird experience.  One day I was out on the porch reading the=20
book, and these two guys were painting the house, and one of them came down,=
=20
and I remember he looked like Trotsky, he had Trotsky=92s beard.  So, anyway=
,=20
Trotsky asks, =93What are you reading?=94  And I said it=92s this Mentor Boo=
k of=20
Major American Poets.  He asked if he could see it.  So I gave it to him, an=
d=20
he flipped through it, stopped at a page and asked me to read it, which was=20
this poem by Wallace Stevens called =93The Emperor of Ice Cream.=94  So I re=
ad=20
the poem, and he asks me what I think it means.  I couldn=92t even bluff my=20=
way=20
through that, I had absolutely no fucking idea what it meant.  It made no=20
sense to me, you know, I could get the rhythm, and I liked the way the words=
=20
were put together, but I couldn=92t comprehend it in any other way.  I was o=
nly=20
reading surfaces.  So he said it was about someone dying, and showed me the=20
line, =93if her horny feet protrude, they come  /  to show how cold she is,=20=
and=20
dumb.  /  let the lamp afix its beam.  /  the only emperor is the emperor of=
=20
ice cream.=94  He was explaining this and pointing out the images, and=20
something clicked inside me.  Pretty soon I could read a modern poem, I coul=
d=20
read Pound and Williams, and then I was off and running.  But most poets get=
=20
the poetry bug, and then the bug goes away after awhile, because there=92s n=
o=20
feedback.

MR:   Yeah, you really do need initial insight.  You need the key to open up=
=20
the language.

JC:   Maybe that=92s why all those poets are out there grinding out their=20
submissions to a million magazines, because they need that feedback.  Maybe=20
that=92s what it=92s about for them, I don=92t know.  But most of the poets=20=
I knew=20
who were writing in the =9170s and =9180s stopped writing.  There=92s a few=20=
still=20
around who are really dyed-in-the-wool types, like Gil Ott.  There was=20
another Ott, a Tom Ott, and so many other names.  I=92d have to drag out tho=
se=20
publications being issued back then to remember them all, because almost non=
e=20
of those people are writing anymore.

MR:  I stopped writing for years.  And I don=92t even get nervous about it=20
anymore.

JC:   Really?

MR:   Yep!  In fact I just started writing again after not writing for a=20
couple of years.  And it used to get me really nervous because it was tied i=
n=20
with that Narcissistic thing where it=92s tied in with your self-religion. =20=
You=20
know, =93IT IS I, THE POET!=94  But now I=92m relaxed about it.  It=92s almo=
st okay=20
when I stop because I wonder what I=92ll be writing when I go there again. =20=
And=20
then when it starts it=92s the easiest thing in the world.  I mean I=92ve be=
en=20
through long periods where it just isn=92t happening.  I started at a very=20
young age, and was lucky I was always encouraged.  My parents were always=20
behind me.  They would read us poems--

JC:   (laughs)  --OH MY GOD!  I=92M TRYING TO IMAGINE MY FATHER!

MR:   (laughs)  Yeah, my parents always really valued it.  Like I said=20
though, it used to bother me when I wasn=92t writing, but now when I start=20
again I get to see what=92s been going on inside me while I was waiting.  An=
d=20
then I think, =93OOO!  What=92s going to be NEXT!?=94

JC:   When the field lies fallow, and you plant again, you get a better crop=
.=20
 It=92s part of a process.

MR:   Yeah, there=92s no such thing as a wasted experience, or wasted time.=20=
=20
Everything is percolating.

JC:   Filed away.

MR:   Yeah, and it=92s there for you.  And you realize after all that time h=
as=20
passed, there was actually development going on in your head, and in your=20
life.  As you=92re maturing you=92re writing is actually maturing.  It=92s n=
ever=20
like, here you are at 36, and you haven=92t written since you were 32, and y=
ou=20
start again, and you=92re not going to be writing 32 year old poems.

JC:   You have experiences, then you mature out of the experiences.  If=20
somebody you know dies and you=92ve never experienced death, well, it=92s ha=
rd to=20
go through it, but you do.  And you change, and you may not even be aware=20
that you=92ve changed.  And I think that gets into the writing.  The funny=20
thing is, when I first started writing poems--which was in the age of the=20
typewriter--I had this method which was to put a sheet a paper into the=20
typewriter, type a draft of the poem, then put a fresh sheet in and retype=20
the poem, even if I was just moving a word or a line.  Or even just a piece=20
of punctuation.  I would keep rewriting the poem so at the end of a working=20
session there would be a pile of maybe 75 or 80 pieces of paper stacked up.=20=
=20
Of course I would be smoking cigarettes and drinking coffee.  But the funny=20
thing is the poem had to happen my way.  I don=92t really see it that way=20
anymore.  Somehow I figured out, or it was shown to me that the poem can=20
gestate.  All kinds of gestation is going on all the time.  I can work on th=
e=20
poem, and put it away, and go back, maybe two months, three months later, an=
d=20
everything that=92s weak and stupid is GLARING!  The changes I need to make=20
somehow seem to suggest themselves, and the process, instead of taking a few=
=20
days or a week may need three months or a year.  I was never a fast writer=20
anyway, writing a lot of poems.

MR:   I=92m really quite the opposite.  And it=92s gotten more so as I=92ve=20=
gotten=20
older.  If something doesn=92t come out quick enough it=92s belabored, and i=
t=92s=20
no good. =20

JC:   Really?

MR:   Yes.  And I revise, but if I can=92t fix it real soon, it=92s stopped.=
  It=20
just got to be the way I do it.  If I do it slowly it doesn=92t happen.  I=
=92m=20
doing a project with a friend of mine.  Both of us hadn=92t been writing for=
=20
awhile, just reading.  We accompanied one another through our mid-life=20
crises, we met each other right there in the middle of it.  We went through=20
all kinds of shit together.  He was a CEO of a big ventilator fan company. =20
He hated it, and wanted to be a poet.  He was having migraines and all kinds=
=20
of stuff.  So he changed his life, although he=92s still in business because=
 he=20
has things he needs to support.  It=92s always his challenge to not let that=
=20
life overtake his creative life.  So anyway, we said okay, we=92ll get toget=
her=20
once a week, we=92ll each bring a poem, we=92ll read a poem.  We=92re both v=
ery=20
remedial about it all because we=92ve both been through these situations whi=
ch=20
took us away from writing and we=92re trying to get back into it.  When we g=
et=20
together we decide on a topic, or an exercise to do, then we get together th=
e=20
next week and talk about what we=92ve done.  I=92ve found that when I get th=
e=20
assignment and think about it, I get very self conscious about it and let it=
=20
sit.  Then it will get to be Tuesday, and we=92re getting together Wednesday=
=20
morning.  So it=92s Tuesday evening and I=92ll think =93SHIT I have to do th=
is!=94 =20
But I sit down and it comes out.  So far they=92re valuable pieces, they=92r=
e not=20
just okay, they=92re not just fulfilling an obligation.  I=92m loving that I=
 work=20
this way.  If something doesn=92t come out right I have no qualms about lett=
ing=20
it go.

JC:   Toss it.

MR:   Toss it.  Yeah, toss it into a drawer, don=92t toss it into the trash=20
can.  But this ends up to be the way that I work, and I like it.

JC:   It=92s funny because when I first started to do this people would tell=
=20
me, =93You really need to write it out in long hand and then type it.=94  Or=
,=20
=93You=92ve GOT to read these, these are the IMPORTANT poets.=94  All these=20=
=93you=92ve=20
got to=92s,=94 and =93you musts,=94 and you HAVE to do this, and THIS doesn=
=92t matter.=20
 There was all this instruction coming down from people, and I don=92t know=20=
why=20
they were doing that.  I guess maybe to make themselves feel important. =20
There=92s also the motive of wanting to help, but it was not helpful.  I thi=
nk=20
people need to find their own way, what they=92re comfortable with in writin=
g. =20
How they do it, when they do it, the process of the means.

MR:   It=92s personal, isn=92t it?

JC:   YES!

MR:   There=92s the academic mill, which I hate to get into, but it has valu=
e,=20
and I think people who go that route are respected, and I don=92t begrudge t=
hem=20
that.  But it does kind of impersonalize the process.  And when you get out=20
of the atmosphere of being in the workshop, you look at the brochures, and=20
it=92s the same people going from camp to camp teaching.  And what are they=20
going to say to you?  They=92re going to tell you how they do it.

JC:   Aesthetic bedouins!

MR:   (laughs)  Yeah!  My academic path was pretty funny because I started=20
off with Stephen Dunn, who was my first workshop teacher.  He=92d hover over=
=20
you and tell you what makes a good poem and what makes a bad poem.  And he=20
would take your bad poem and show you how to make it into a good poem, or=20
he=92d say =93OH! don=92t try that other thing until you=92re 45!=94  I have=
 in my=20
notes from that time, when I was 18, an outline of how to write a poem, the=20
beginning, the middle, the end.  And then I went to Naropa where everyone wa=
s=20
just WHAAAA-CRAZY!  A lot of poets there just OPENED things up for me!  Ted=20
Berrigan was there, and he was just so funny, and he=92d say =93Just try=20
anything!  Just keep writing!  If you=92re a poet you should be reading FIVE=
=20
BOOKS A DAY!  And you should be writing THREE POEMS A DAY!=94  They wanted y=
ou=20
to try anything, and if you couldn=92t, there were all these people with lis=
ts=20
of things for you to try.  And of course it was tied in with this crazy sex=20
and drug thing that was going on, you know, it was certainly NOT dry!

JC:   The anti-Dunn!

MR:   (laughs)  Yeah, the anti-Dunn!  But at the same time to have this=20
skeleton of structure underneath all the Naropa stuff, I don=92t think it=20
harmed me at all.  It was kind of a good base to put all this other stuff=20
ontop of.  But at the same time, something you could completely depart from.=
 =20
And that=92s okay to completely depart from it.  But I always have a sense f=
rom=20
my poetry education about where to break a line, when it ends, you know, it=
=92s=20
this underlying sense that I got from those earliest experiences.  But I=20
don=92t think most poets are fortunate enough to have had this other Naropa=20
stuff ontop of that.

JC:   They either go the Dunn route or the Naropa route with nothing in=20
between.

MR:   Right.

JC:   I=92ve never studied poetry with somebody.

MR:   (laughs)  I=92ve studied with so many fucking people!  I was a whore!

JC:   (laughs)  I think it runs in my family that we=92re stubborn people. =20=
And=20
I certainly am, and it=92s not always an admirable character trait.  It mean=
s=20
you hold onto things you probably shouldn=92t be holding onto.  But it can a=
lso=20
be valuable.  In the beginning I would read people like Dylan Thomas, Roethk=
e=20
and Lowell, you know, all these people who were held up as the contemporary=20
gods of poetry.  And I wanted to write like them, and I did write like them,=
=20
and I thought it was all very accomplished, and thought my immediate rise wa=
s=20
imminent.  THEN when I STOPPED drinking--

MR:   (both of them laughing)  --OH YEAH!

JC:   I threw it all out!  And started all over, at 27, 28.

MR:   Oh, so that was the Great Divide for you?

JC:   ABSOLUTELY!  I tossed it out, and my drinking was so connected to my=20
writing, because I thought if you could write successfully you were allowed=20
to be a drunk.  So it was sort of permission to be a drunk.  My drinking got=
=20
so out of control, but my big crisis came when I said to myself that if I=20
stop drinking I won=92t be able to write.  And a voice in my head said =93So=
=20
what!=94  I stopped drinking, and after about six months I started writing=20
again.  There was gestation going on, some process, and there was finally a=20
level of control that I didn=92t have previously.  And the poems were not as=
=20
noticeably derived.  I kind of felt like I was on my way, but I still needed=
=20
to flounder for awhile before I could find the useful models.

MR:   Floundering is part of the process.

JC:   ABSOLUTELY!

MR:   You really have allow yourself as much of that as you need!

JC:   Right, can=92t fear to flounder!  I was like a lot of people though, I=
=20
wanted it right away!  I wanted masterpieces, and I wanted it NOW!  You know=
?=20
 But you can=92t squeeze that out of your head, it=92s a whole experience.

MR:   Not to keep bringing up this age thing, but not only is it amazing to=20
me what happens over the years, but how it=92s so sanctioned.  Under 40 you=
=92re=20
considered a younger poet.  And there seems to be this RACE to be a prodigy!=
 =20
Right?  You get attention when you=92re young, you=92re with these older poe=
ts,=20
well, you=92ve never studied with anyone, but, they=92re always looking for=20=
the=20
one who will be their prot=E9g=E9.  They=92re always looking to see who the=20
interesting person is, and how they=92ll develop.

JC:   The Byron thing.

MR:   The Byron thing?

JC:   Who is going to be the next Byron.

MR:   Yeah-yeah, that=92s right.  So you get that kind of attention, and I w=
as=20
a very immature young person.  Kind of starry-eyed going into these=20
situations, and I=92d be kind of shy, and get attention from someone who had=
=20
stature, and everyone would pay attention to that.  And I saw it going on al=
l=20
around me with different people.  And then it gets to be this race to be a=20
young poet who has made it.

JC:   Up and coming.

MR:   Not even up and coming, you=92re there!  You know, you=92ve TRANSCENDE=
D all=20
that, and you=92re just this gifted thing.  Now I=92m just so glad that it h=
as=20
more longevity than that.  When I look back at how I perceived the people I=20
was hanging out with back then, I realize there was very little truth to it.=
 =20
It=92s a lot cooler to be where I am now than I thought it would be.

JC:   I deeply distrusted their motives, the people who were famous and blew=
=20
into town, if they were nice to me I just assumed it was really because they=
=20
wanted to fuck me.

MR:   (laughs)  Wow, well that=92s nice too!

JC:   (laughs)  Maybe that=92s my hangup.  But I didn=92t trust them, though=
=20
that=92s not true with everybody.  You sort of follow your instincts, like y=
ou=20
can tell the real deal, somebody like Allen Ginsberg or Gregory Corso or=20
James Broughton.  After awhile I figured out the poetry that was interesting=
=20
to me was everything coming out of those avant-garde movements of the 50=92s=
=20
and 60=92s that came together in The New American Poetry.  At a certain poin=
t=20
in time I decided to track down whoever of these poets was still alive, get=20
their books, study them, find out about them, and MEET them if I could!  Eve=
n=20
send them fan letters, which I did.

MR:   They=92re all so accessible, aren=92t they?

JC:   Absolutely.  Not snotty, not condescending.  I don=92t think anyone I=20
ever encountered from that group was too terribly awful, except Harold Norse=
.=20
 Not like academic poets who have this force field and barbs around them.

MR:   (laughs)  The Sit At My Feet Poets!

JC:   (laughs)  Yeah, that=92s what they want, they=92re always looking for=20
disciples and imitators, mirrors really.

MR:  Meanwhile, the others, those guys were kind of raucous, they wanted to=20
have fun, they--

JC:   --they were doing their thing!  There was no pretense really, in who=20
they were and what they were doing.  I went to San Francisco in 1989, three=20
days after an earthquake.  I had this grant from the Pennsylvania Arts=20
Council, to be lazy for several months--

MR:   --Linh Dinh always called his Pew Fellowship subsidized alcoholism!

JC:   Ooo!  (laughs)

MR:   (laughs)  Yeah, he=92s literary now, he doesn=92t just drink.  Anyway,=
 go=20
ahead, I=92m sorry.

JC:  (laughs)  At this time I was past the point where I had any alcoholism=20
to subsidize, but I=92m sure it would have been that if I=92d still been=20
drinking.  So I went to San Francisco because there were people there I=20
wanted to meet.  And I pulled whatever strings there were to be pulled to=20
meet them.  One of them was Steve Abbot, who was part of this whole group of=
=20
people out there writing new narrative fiction.  Sort of like LANGUAGE poetr=
y=20
before it was a school and had an ideology complete with tanks and=20
battleships.  So we met and had lunch at the Cafe Flore.  I really admired=20
his first two books, they were brilliant, and couldn=92t WAIT for the third=20
book.  But then there was a book of essays, and something else and something=
=20
else, and I was awaiting this third book of poetry.  And I asked him when hi=
s=20
next book of poems was coming out, naive fool I was, I mean, if it was comin=
g=20
out it would have come out, right?  Maybe I was just making conversation, an=
d=20
I didn=92t know it at the time but he was dying.

MR:  Ooops!

JC:   Yeah, I know.  So he said, =93Well you know how it is, after you=92re=20
thirty the poems slow down and then just stop coming altogether.=94

MR:   (laughs)  GEEZE!

JC:   And he was being very straightforward, but he was talking about his ow=
n=20
experience.  Of course I assumed, out of my own Narcissism, that that was a=20
message for me, and my fork STOPPED in mid-air, enroute to my mouth!

MR:   (laughs)  Looking if he was watching!

JC:   (laughs)  YEAH!  And I thought OH FUCK I better RUN HOME and write=20
WHILE I CAN!

MR:   (laughs)  God, that=92s AWFUL!

JC:   And later I realized maybe that was true for Steve.  He did some more=20
good things, and he died a few years later.  But everybody has their own=20
method.  Maybe the poetry is coming out of how you interact with the world,=20
as well as your own personal history.  There=92s a sort of dynamic between=20
those two things.  Maybe the poetry is a way of seeing and it rises out of=20
that.  I mean I=92m not even really sure, all I know for sure is that it=92s=
=20
there, and that it can be really intimidating.  About whether or not it=92s=20
working, or whether or not it will still be there.  I also think it=92s a gi=
ft,=20
like beauty, like time.  It=92s on loan, and I=92ve seen people who=92ve abu=
sed the=20
power of poetry, only to have it taken away from them.

MR:   I think anything you get anxiety around, the anxiety is just a=20
constrictor.  You talked about drinking and post drinking as your Great=20
Divide.  For me it was things in my domestic life, things that were not as=20
sharp a divide for me, but it made me self conscious, and gave me anxiety=20
about what I was writing.

JC:   You mean after you were out of the marriage?

MR:   When I got into the marriage.

JC:   Okay.

MR:   All of a sudden I wasn=92t this free spirit, I was a wife.  And I stil=
l=20
wrote, and I think I was fortunate in that my husband never had any interest=
=20
in reading what I wrote.

JC:   You=92re KIDDING!?

MR:   No, but it was actually a good thing because it freed me to write=20
whatever I wanted without fear of retribution.  But now being out of the=20
marriage is a whole other step I=92m taking.  You know, it=92s like starting=
 your=20
life over, and I went through a period of feeling really infantile about it.=
 =20

JC:   You mean once you were out of it?

MR:   Once I was out of my marriage, which was problematic, obviously, or I=20
would still be in it.  So here I am at this whole other juncture, and I have=
=20
this thing that I=92ve done since I was little, writing, and I am doing=20
different things with it now.  And it=92s kind of exciting to figure that ou=
t. =20
We were talking about the anxiety around writing, it=92s something we have t=
o=20
breathe in and let it take its course.  And come to realize, yeah, it is a=20
gift.  This is not something everybody has at their disposal.  I=92m just=20
learning to relax about it.  It=92s that whole floundering thing again,=20
learning to allow yourself to flounder, come to accept it as part of the=20
craft, part of the process.

JC:   I think what=92s most intimidating about it, especially if you do it f=
or=20
a very long time, it defines who you are.  And it=92s really hard to separat=
e=20
the doing of it, or the intent to do it, from your identity.  I never=20
introduce myself to anyone saying I=92m a poet.  And I don=92t like when peo=
ple=20
introduce me and say, =93This is Jim Cory, he=92s a poet.=94

MR:   (laughs)  I know.

JC:   (laughs)  I just wish the whole thing would kind of go away.  Because=20
then people start to ask naive questions, and you=92ll even meet people who=20=
are=20
mean-spirited and will set out to ambush you for it.  But on the other hand,=
=20
the act of doing it is inseparable from how I see myself, and who I believe=20
myself to be.  Not even in the sense of a compilation of facts about myself=20
in my head, but who I FEEL myself to be!  That ability to do that, I took fo=
r=20
granted at one time.  But now it=92s something I never take for granted,=20
because I=92m aware it could go away, I=92m aware it could die out.    The o=
nly=20
degree I have is in history, so I=92ve always been interested in literary=20
history.  So I=92ve spent time studying how long people wrote.  For instance=
=20
Whitman really only had twelve productive years of writing, and the poems=20
that would have become the equivalent of Leave of Grass end up as Specimen=20
Days, his memoir.  Now on the other hand you get someone like William Carlos=
=20
Williams and he=92s banging out these incredible poems literally from 1907 t=
o=20
the day he died in 1963.  How do you sustain it?  I=92m fascinated by that!=20=
=20
Somebody needs to write a book about this whole aspect.  How is this force=20
generated?  Whether it=92s intellectual, moral or spiritual, I don=92t know.=
  How=20
is it sustained?

MR:   My daughter, my eight-year-old, has just had this realization that=20
we=92re all going to die.

JC:   How did she find this out?

MR:   Oh with kids, it=92s just something that dawns on them.  Kids are so=20
morbid.  They=92re SO morbid.  This idea that you have to protect them from=20
this, and everything has to be pink and blue is just such a transposition of=
=20
adult fear put onto kids.  You know?  They=92re very morbid kind of early, a=
nd=20
then it comes to a point when they=92re eight-years-old and they really real=
ize=20
all these things can really happen.  My daughter sees that I could die, her=20
father could die, she=92s asking me to get an alarm system.  She says =93I=
=92m=20
afraid when I=92m with you that something might happen to daddy, and when I=
=92m=20
with him I=92m afraid something might happen you.  And I don=92t want anyone=
 to=20
die.=94  And here I am, and I have to give her the words of wisdom.  I=92m t=
rying=20
to help her be with that, and at the same time try to get her to see that=20
it=92s something you need to let go of.  Because you don=92t want to spend a=
ll=20
this time with this uncomfortable feeling.  It=92s a really unpleasant way t=
o=20
spend time, and I=92m just trying to repeat that to her.  And I=92m trying t=
o=20
live that as well.  And to relate that to writing, you know, it=92s that=20
question, =93Okay, when=92s it gonna end, oh no, when=92s it gonna end.=94 =20=
That=20
constricts it.  Who knows when it=92s going to end?  It might go away, it mi=
ght=20
come back.  I=92m really getting to know how to relax with it.

JC:   I have friends I=92ve known since I was in my late teens, early twenti=
es.=20
 I have a good friend in Boston named Peggy Malloy.  And she is today pretty=
=20
much who she was when we were at Penn State.  She dresses the same, her=20
interests are the same, she=92s interested in acting, she=92s in plays in Bo=
ston,=20
and there=92s this continuum of the twenty-year-old Peggy and the=20
fifty-year-old Peggy.  The fifty-year-old is just an older version of the=20
twenty-year-old.  It=92s a pleasure to know her, and when we get together it=
=92s=20
just like it was when we were in school together.  But on the other hand I=20
know people who became very different people, because of quote unquote,=20
responsibility.  They have this thing where they say, =93I=92ve got to be an=
=20
adult now.=94  And they sort of get carried away with it and they become=20
different, and when you meet them again they=92re so different you despair a=
t=20
ever really having the connection again.

MR:   You were saying this in an e-mail.  About what happens to people when=20
they get afraid to play anymore.

JC:   Unfortunately I think it happens to a lot of people.

MR:   I guess it does, yeah, I guess it does.  It=92s sad.

JC:   One of the things I=92ve realized is I will probably always be writing=
.

MR:   AH!  Knock on wood!  You never know!

JC:   But the reason I say that is I=92ve learned there=92s a lot of differe=
nt=20
ways to write.  In the beginning I thought there was this way to write a=20
poem, it=92s got stanzas, it=92s got a title, it=92s got a beginning, a midd=
le and=20
an end, it has a certain tone, it has rhythmic form.  But now my whole=20
definition of that has been completely upended as a result of my reading, my=
=20
interaction, so that a poem for me can now be a list of aphorisms.  One of=20
them might occur to me while I=92m working out at the gym.  Or somebody migh=
t=20
say something very clever, and if they don=92t write it down then it becomes=
 my=20
property, I take it home and work it into my list of aphorisms.  Or I might=20
undertake to write a very long poem, which is what I=92ve been doing lately,=
=20
doing a poem about the extinction of the Ivory Billed Woodpecker.  And=20
nowhere am I in the poem, it=92s all about the woodpecker, it=92s all about=20=
their=20
process, their story.  The decimation of the forests when the Europeans=20
arrived, and the continued decimation by their descendants is all part of it=
.=20
 It=92s kind of a meditation on that through one particular, very small, but=
=20
somehow significant aspect of it.  Or I might choose to write about the=20
architect Louis Sullivan, who designed 190 things, mostly buildings, and my=20
mission in that is to write 190 sections of a poem.  And I have to figure ou=
t=20
190 things to say about him.  So in the beginning the poems were all about t
elling the world ALL ABOUT ME!  As if ME was anything really.  It=92s kind o=
f=20
pathetic when I look back on it now, but the energy was there.  Somehow or=20
other the corner was turned, and now that doesn=92t seem at all important, i=
t=20
almost seems a little bit embarrassing.

MR:   (laughs)  I still write about ME!  I can=92t get enough of ME!  I=92m=20=
SO=20
fascinating!  Well, I don=92t know if that=92s true, I guess in a way it is.=
  The=20
act of writing something down is very transformational, and there=92s someth=
ing=20
very mysterious about it.  If you write a court portrait of somebody and put=
=20
them in a very noble light, it may not make for interesting literature.  In=20
the best literature people are not flawless.  If you can present their flaws=
=20
in a sensitive and intelligent way, then you don=92t just have a bunch of=20
gossip about a bunch of people you know, but you also have a good story.  Bu=
t=20
then you=92re stuck with this dilemma of having a really good story, but a l=
ot=20
of people you know in the poem don=92t look very good.

JC:   Oh I would never worry about what they thought of the way they were=20
portrayed.

MR:   No?

JC:   No.

MR:   (laughs)  That=92s my newfound repression I=92m trying to get passed.

JC:  The hardest thing for me is to find the verbal equivalent of what I=20
feel.  I can, just from long practice, come up with the verbal equivalent of=
=20
what I see, touch, taste or smell, you know what I mean?  The verbal=20
equivalent of what I feel is a whole other challenge.  And it=92s only going=
 to=20
happen if I=92m open to it happening, or lucky, which is so-called inspirati=
on.

MR:  But you also get to that through the senses.

JC:   Yeah, through the senses.

MR:   I think that=92s maybe how you=92re opening to it.

JC:   That=92s my road I travel, right there.

MR:   Because otherwise it=92s just abstract.

JC:   I find poems interesting that mix the two.  You=92re in a poem that=
=92s=20
going along at a certain pace, clearly has an objective, and then it suddenl=
y=20
segues into something else.

MR:   What=92s that James Wright poem?  What=92s it called?  Oh god, it=92s=20=
be
autiful.  He=92s sitting in the hammock, he=92s looking at the horse, then h=
e=92s=20
looking at something else, and then the last line is, =93I=92ve wasted my li=
fe.=94 =20
It=92s this beautiful little poem, and there=92s this eruption of feeling. =20=
It=92s=20
this quiet little bomb.

JC:   There=92s this Zukofsky poem, you probably know it.  There=92s a prayi=
ng=20
mantis on the subway, and so much is pulled out of the poem that you have to=
=20
reimagine the context.  So that you can make sense of it, and that=92s the=20
challenge of it.  And it can always be done, but sometimes it=92s the hardes=
t=20
thing to do.  I remember finally getting to the end of it and being amazed b=
y=20
the complexity of it, and yet it takes me back to the futility of it, of thi=
s=20
totally beautiful and seemingly insignificant insect inside this human=20
contraption, the subway.  This ultimately unnecessary and gratuitous thing=20
that moves human beings around.  The poem had real power, and it was about a=
=20
bug.  But he managed to pull it off, and it was long, and it took all these=20
detours.  For me that=92s really the kind of poem I aim to write.

MR:   What=92s the name of that poem?

JC:   I forget, we could dig it up, I=92ve got it here somewhere.  [note:  i=
t=20
is the last piece in Zukofsky=92s 29 Songs.]

MR:   I haven=92t read Zukofsky in years.  I=92m really looking forward to b=
eing=20
in my new store and just having books in front of me, having them in my=20
hands, as part of my work.  Because there=92s so much I put off, there=92s s=
o=20
much I haven=92t read in many years.  That rift, that domestic rift where I=
=92m=20
involved with my kids, involved with things going on in the home, yeah,=20
that=92s where I got off the train.

JC:   I imagine it=92s very difficult to try to concentrate when you=92ve go=
t=20
children around.

MR:   Yeah.  It=92s hard to concentrate on things that people who don=92t ha=
ve=20
children concentrate on.  Although I am getting a whole different view of=20
language because they=92re developing, they=92re learning.  And I=92m very=20
fortunate because my children are very verbal, my daughter is extremely=20
fascinated by language.  She has a very large and natural vocabulary for her=
=20
age.  And she has been developing this since she was very young.  Like when=20
she was three, I=92d finish reading her a book and she would ask, =93Can you=
 read=20
it to me backwards now?=94  She=92s always had a fascination with words, in=20
context, but also as objects.  She just gets a big kick out of it.  So that=
=92s=20
kept it fresh for me as well.  So, I haven=92t had the time to really read o=
n=20
my own.  That=92s what makes poems great, because they=92re short, and I can=
 get=20
a poem in.  I may not be able to finish the book, but I can get a poem in. =20
So I don=92t get to concentrate like I did before I had kids around, but now=
 I=20
get to concentrate on different things.  Having kids adds a whole other=20
dimension, but if you don=92t have kids you don=92t really understand.

JC:   Yeah, I=92m sure.

MR:   I get to watch them, and travel around the city with them, and they=
=92re=20
so interesting and bizarre, and I watch how quickly they pick up on things.=20=
=20
And the way they take turns in their thinking, in ways I=92m not privy to,=20
because I=92m there at the front of it, and I=92m the guide.  But they=92re=20=
so much=20
their own people.  They=92re thinking what they think, and they=92re interpr=
eting=20
things all the time.  It=92s been very enriching.  But now that they=92re=20
loosening up some, and are more independent, I can go back to writing and=20
reading.  It=92s going to be interesting to see how all this will affect my=20
work.  Not just how it=92s affected my writing, but how it=92s affected my=20
outlook that comes through in my writing, which is totally unexpected.  You=20
know, it=92s not hanging out, like I used to hang out, it=92s something else=
. =20
It=92s not that it=92s not as intense, but then anything is intense if you=
=92re=20
going to let it be.

JC:   When I=92m around children, it=92s like they=92re little aliens to me.

MR:   (laughs)  WELL THEY ARE!

JC:   (laughs)  It=92s because they=92re nowhere to be seen in my life.  Lik=
e=20
before this last Thanksgiving, this guy came over to give me an estimate on=20
glazing the bathtub.  And somehow or other in the course of the conversation=
=20
he mentions he=92s 46-years-old, and he says, =93My daughter=92s coming over=
 for=20
Thanksgiving, and she=92s bringing her children.=94  And I thought, =93Wait=20=
a=20
minute, he=92s two years younger than me, and HIS DAUGHTER HAS CHILDREN!=94

MR:   It=92s weird isn=92t it?

Hello Poetics List Folks,
This is my first post to this list, and it's not about poetics so
much as it is about tools for creating a kind of poetry I have been
writing. I have been working with and old Macintosh program called
Electric Poet to create Markov chain models of source texts. A
Markoved text is randomized version of the source that is based upon
the statistical likelihood of one word appearing after another in the
source text. You can see some of the poetry I've generate using this
tool and cut-up methods at 5_trope:
http://webdelsol.com/5_trope/14/craig.htm.

I need a new software tool because I'm wanting to change the way the
Markov algorithm works, to continue my exploration of language and
defamiliarization in new ways, and because Electric Poet is no longer
supported.

I have little money and less time because I'm working on a
dissertation. It's hard enough for me to find time to write, but I
must because it's the only way to keep me me as I work on this
academic thing. So I don't have much to invest in a new programming
tool. So I want advice on the choice I've made of Perl to do this
thing.

Does anyone here have experience creating software tools to work with
poetry? It seems there must be from the work I see discussed and
posted. And has anyone used Perl for this? I'm also interested in
suggestions of alternative tools for this, given my lack of time and
cash.

This prose is horrible. I've been reading software manuals since I
got up, and my brain is very, very patriarchally poetic now. (I'm
also a digest reader, rather than continuous postings--perhaps it
would be better to discuss this "backchannel" anyway.) JP

I've used Perl and it works quite well. If you're on a Mac, you can get
Perl at the OSX prompt of course. There are any number of books for
learning it.

Perl of course is free. You can also get various forms of Winperl for
Windows (I use Perl in Windows, Linux, Unix, and Mac) -

One way to get around the money issue is to subscribe to
safari.oreilly.com - which is about $10/month and allows you to access
their rather expensive but terrific books on all aspects of Internet and
programming.

Mark--No, I agree with you that Spicer is Cali-centric:  you're making me want
to look at the Vancouver lectures, now, though, to see how that "Californian"
regionality translated across national borders....

I guess the difference I was after is tricky:  the felt sense that one could,
so to speak, recreate Manhattan from O'Hara's poetry ("Joyce's Dublin") is the
classic example here)--a sense I don't get from Spicer's work re. the Bay area.
As for "shared local values," I think maybe you misunderstood me here:  are
such values not implied by the restrictions on circulation Spicer sought to
establish?  In other words, these locally shared values would be explicitly or
implicitly oppositional values, vis a vis larger entities--& my use of the
"cosmopolitan" [not a term without baggage of course] was meant
to suggest a poetry which equally dissented from the national and the universal
claim (for which your invocation of Billy Collins will do very well) but that
did so without claiming the ground of the local....

i wish i could think of a clever thing to introduce this:

Balladry on the bottle and other novel ideas

Canada's chief bard has his own notions, including, perhaps, poetry on
wine labels

By ERIN ANDERSSEN


Tuesday, November 19, 2002 – Print Edition, Page A3


OTTAWA -- Some things you should know about Canada's new chief bard:
George Bowering wants to see poetry on wine bottles. He'd like to ditch
our "embarrassing" national anthem, which he says is sexist, racist,
illogical and grammatically incorrect. He'd rather not pen sonnets to our
troops in Iraq, though he'll serve as war scribe if it comes to that.

And while he's a fan of the current Prime Minister -- he thinks Paul
Martin, the heir-apparent, is masquerading as a Liberal -- the country's
first parliamentary poet laureate vows he won't be rhyming on anyone's
command.

As if to emphasize this point, in a typical moment of jest and with a
television crew filming his first official day on the job, he mimes a pee
on Parliament's front lawn.

If he is to play at court jester (he jokes about getting a pointed hat
with bells), the two-time winner of the Governor-General's Award has begun
his term without a sliver of awe for the trappings and titles that rule
Ottawa. This includes his own, though he does note that the Prime Minister
has yet to call with his congratulations.

"I'm a novelty act," he says over coffee on his first foray into the
parliamentary cafeteria.

"I'm the equivalent of the guy in New Brunswick who grows the 200-pound
pumpkin."

While he has a few "half-baked" ideas, Mr. Bowering hasn't quite figured
out what to do with his new job, for which he is paid $22,000 a year
including travel expenses. The 66-year-old British Columbian put his own
name forward; it was chosen from a final list of three by the Speakers of
the Senate and the House of Commons.

His job description is vague -- he may write poetry, he may hold readings
-- but since he is the first, the post is his to define.

He is hard to pin down in an interview because he is constantly tossing
out saucy one-liners. For his first official luncheon, he wonders whether
he can bum a "free cigarette" from his host. Slogging though the slush to
breakfast, he grumbles, "Why couldn't I be the P.L. for Barbados?"

But don't be deceived. With approximately 50 books -- including an
irreverent take on Canada's prime ministers -- and a long tenure at
British Columbia's Simon Fraser University behind him, he's no
lightweight. He has strong opinions. He's for the Kyoto Protocol and
against the war on Iraq. He considers U.S.America -- his term -- "bullies
who want to run the world."

He admires Prime Minister Jean Chrétien's tenacity, and disses Mr. Martin
for disloyalty. "When it comes to the current travails," he says firmly of
the Prime Minister, "I am on his side."

It bears noting that the poet laureate he most admires in the United
States is not his national counterpart, Billy Collins, who is trying to
get poetry read in schools. It is Amiri Baraka in New Jersey, whom the
state politicians want fired for writing a controversial poem about Sept.
11, in which he is accused of being anti-Semitic. Mr. Bowering has all the
books of the latter, and none of the former. Of Mr. Collins, he is
dismissive; "I get the impression he could write about someone dropping a
chicken on the sidewalk." Of Mr. Baraka, he says he suspects most critics
haven't even read the work in question.

In general, Mr. Bowering says, poetry is meant to be nuanced. "Good poems
tend to make things more difficult than they appear to be."

So he will not be writing "inferior poetry" just because something needs
commemorating. And he plans to steer away from poking fun at politicians,
because it would just be too easy. It may be a bit of a wait before his
first effort. "There's a difference between duty and inspiration. Poets
sometimes sit a long time, waiting for something to happen." He is most
respectful of his muse; the audience comes second.

While he's waiting for inspiration, he will be exploring ideas. He is
seriously pondering a campaign to put poetry on wine labels, though there
may be some self-interest there. He pointedly observes how the British
poet laureate is not only given immunity from parking tickets but also
receives, each year, a free barrel of red wine. "So far my nation has not
even given me a glass of Niagara plonk. I'm going to look into that."

And don't even get him started on the national anthem. While he won't
confirm an official plan to rewrite it, he says he would certainly welcome
a national debate on the subject. "Can you 'command' love?" he demands,
when asked to list some of the 12 things he sees as wrong with it. "Can
you stand 'from' somewhere?"

Today, Mr. Bowering will get the paperwork cleared, the tour of the Hill
covered and will lunch with the Speakers of the Senate and the House of
Commons, who gave him the job. He will attend Rideau Hall tomorrow, where
a dear friend, Roy Miki, is receiving the Governor-General's Award for
poetry -- and then he heads home to Vancouver.

For god's sake why don't we all just pack up and move to
Canada. A country with the good sense to pick a laureate
who nominated himself. If Canada really were in Barbados
I'd be there on the next plane.

This is a difficult and highly individual decision. The most popular medium
for "new media poetry" or whatever we're calling this week seems to be
Flash, but that costs money and is not a good choice for what you want.

I would recommend you check out Squeak, www.squeak.org. I've been working
with this for about a year, and am simply astonished at how close I've been
able to get toward building the authoring environment I've always dreamed
of in bits and pieces.

Almost *any* programming language will let you make algorithms, but at some
stage you will need an interface. Squeak is free and open source.
Personally, I find its graphics paradigm, called Morphic, to be exactly
what I've been looking for for years. I can hardly talk about it without --
well -- squeaking!

john,

you might find some other tools at the TextWorx Toolshed:

  http://www.burningpress.org/toolbox/index.html

there's at lease one additional Markov-based program for mac.

if you're up for rolling yr own, Perl is a good choice--its made for text
manipulation.  if you already know another programming language, you might
look at Python as an alternative--syntax is a little more human-readable.

I was impressed by what George Bowering did when the opportunity presented
itself, and equally so by the fact that a journalist in Canada would be
free to report it. On the opposite hand, we have the reportage on Baraka
and even the notice of Bernstein's reading in D.C., which sink poetry to
dumbed-down critical lows as we lockstep into the next war. We should all
move to Canada and say what we think of the current situation, because
obviously it can't be done here. If a poet could speak, we wouldn't
understand him/her--due to the way the reception has been constructed.

here here barrett & damian! i'm almost tempted to
relocate myself===
i had the misfortune of meeting mr billy collins
once...my alma mater kent state brought him in for a
glowing performance (i hear they had creeley there
last year, which must have been a tremendous
improvement)---i was part of a grad workshop at the
time, & one of their little scolarship winners, so i
had to be brought out for mr collins' rousing
reading...i was tremendously altered at the time (it
being a very different time than now), & had spent
most of the day skipping classes & reading ted
berrigan---so i asked mr collins his opinion of
berrigan---he chuckled and said something like, huh,
yeah, write poems on pepsi and dexedrine===which i
thought a bit dismissive...

What exactly does he mean by Chretien's "tenacity"? Perhaps in quietly
dragging out his term in office?

Meanwhile we had bill C-36 rammed through in a frenzy of destruction of
civil liberties USA-style; Chretien today pledged to send Canadian troops
to war with Iraq if need be; Canadian citizens born in countries on US
hit-lists are being detained at the US border to our government's
acquiescence --

But Collins may have had a point.  Pepsi has caffeine
in it, which is addictive.

It's part of a group of stimulants called xanthines.

The negative effects of Pepsi can make you

     anxious
     excitable
     restless
     dizzy
     irritable
     unable to concentrate
     gastrointestinal (GI) aches
     headaches that don't seem to go away
     trouble with sleeping

(http://www.goaskalice.columbia.edu/1485.html)

Since caffeine is a diuretic, Pepsi causes calcium
loss in the urine, so Pepsi can lead to osteoporosis.

"Studies have also shown that caffeine [Pepsi]
decreases reaction time to both visual and auditory
stimuli . . . [Pepsi] can diminish performance of
manual tasks that involve delicate muscular
coordination and accurate timing."

(http://www.erowid.org/chemicals/caffeine/caffeine_effects.shtml)

Pepsi can reduce the cerebral flow of oxygen to the
brain by as much as 30%, leading to memory problems.

(http://www.flp-aloevera.co.uk/avoid_caffeine.htm)

Caffeine enters the breast milk.  Although it appears
in only small amounts, infants do not excrete caffeine
efficiently.  So, women drinking Pepsi can make their
babies irritable and restless.

(http://www.extension.iastate.edu/nutrition/01feb16.html)


Pepsi was invented by Caleb Bradham in 1898, and the
"Birthplace of Pepsi" store is maintained on the site
of the original pharmacy where Bradham discovered the
formula, in New Bern, North Carolina.

[TO SEE A PHOTOGRAPH OF CALEB BRADHAM, GO TO

http://www.pepsistore.com/images/bradham.jpg]


Pepsi-Cola Company also owns a deceptively clear
beverage, Mountain Dew, which nonetheless contains
caffeine.



Sounds like Billy Collins may have been on a
carbonated water such as Perrier when he has talking
to you, or even a seltzer such as Schweppe's, and
aspirin.

(The tingly bubbliness of carbonation or seltzer could
have induced that "chuckling"-like response you noted
in him, Lewis.)

One of his kukicha and bee pollen days, then.
Definitely sounds like Ginsberg on kukicha and bee
pollen.



Billy Collins' agent is the Stephen Barclay Agency
(which also manages Seamus Heaney, Robert Pinsky, W.S.
Merwin, Tony Kushner, David Sedaris, Amy Tan, and
others).

If you are looking for a markov generator for perl, there is one
implementation by Ron Starr which can be found here:

http://www.eskimo.com/~rstarr/poormfa/poemtool.html

Also, the burning deck site has a tools page with numerous programs for mac
and pc:

http://www.burningpress.org/toolbox/

There is also the computer generated writing page which is somewhat out of
date:

http://www.evolutionzone.com/kulturezone/c-g.writing/index_body.html

A decent book, (and one of very few on the topic), is Charles O. Hartman's
'Virtual Muse'... a quick read.

I had put together a list of links to PERL modules which could be used in
computer generated writing, you may find these useful (the module list is at
the end of the email).

I'm currently writingin a Java application called the GTR Language
Workebench, which is an application for the systematic generation, analysis
and transformation of natural language texts.  It is analagous to a
Photoshop for words, consisting of various 'filters' or transformers which
you can combine in new ways to make more complex transformational processes.
It's still in a beta version, but looking at a release in the summer.  I'll
be posting an annoucement to the poetics list.  Also, if you are interested
in this topic in general, you may find that the UBUWEB listserv of interest.

I sure hope you did, George, it's truly brilliant and pithy. Who, after
all, would want poems to make things simpler than they are. President
Bush, maybe, or the aforementioned Mr Collins.

I got to talk to Stephan Barclay a few years ago. He is a very nice LA kind
of agent. Odd for poets and Noble Prize promoter. I was trying to book a
speaker for our college and he called back when I was in the shower. I
jumped out thinking it was someone else I was expecting to call. I asked if
he could call back as I was dripping wet just out of the shower. He seemed
amused and kept right on talking.

Best, Geoffrey

This is a great list of links that you and the others have been providing,
DA! But do any of these text-based transformation programs deal with
phonemes, say, as opposed to letters and words? After all, poetry is
organized SOUND, not pictographs!

I have experimented with creating texts using strict patterns of vowel
phonemes as permutational tone-rows a la serial music, and would love to do
something like that more extensively with the aid of an algorithm. Any
chance that something like this already exists or allows me to come close?

BW focuses on media misrepresentation, but isn't there a more essential question, to wit: What is poetry able to communicate about political life that isn't already present among the contending points of view?  We have already been served large helpings of satire and clownishness, and no minds have been changed.  Why should a reader looking for guidance on U.S. foreign policy turn to poetry instead of the NY Times editorial pages (or to any of the websites that Patrick Herron has been citing)?

I think there are ways to answer these questions.  Take the issue of homelessness.  This has been, I think, one of the most common topics chosen by poets who wish to engage social questions: maybe because it manifests itself on an individual (that is, lyric) scale.  Heather Fuller writes about homelessness, with some success, in Dovecote (the dovecote, one notes, is a figure for communal shelter).  I think the value of these lines, from "Trip Set," derives from the psychological honesty of the speaker and, just as importantly, the humor and weirdness of some of the writing.  Rather than merely show off the poet's personal charm or daffiness, this weirdness has the scent of another person's actual life:

follow him
he returned from the institution with a lisp

he said it was a good place

good place for a letter bomb

I sent vitamins and postcards

working in the vatican of accountability

cash comes into my hands and I
find excuses

eventually the eviction of squatters
after the effigy of flags

it's easier to cry for the anonymous
neighborhood burning down

an action in missing

Honesty (the speaker's admission that, when she gets a little cash, she finds excuses to keep it for herslf) and authenticity (the ex-mental patient's lisp -- how strange) embodied in the speech of our time ("good place for a letter bomb"): these things are at home on lyric terrain.  The lines do not, I think, offer much in the way of social analysis, but then that may be beside the point.  Perhaps lyric candor and a spirit of inquiry into other people's lives ("follow him...") are enough.

Is this Billy Collins so bad or is it that basically we dont like his poetry
philosophically: its a knd of divide we find here in New Zealand also. And
there are good and bad in "both camps" ....I didnt know him from a bar of
soap but he was lauded here some months abck at a literary festival or
something ...but there are reasons for that. The "official" verse gets more
attention for various political phiosophical and finacial reasons (hence
people in general know about Ted Hughes but not Ron Silliman [(although in
the Auck Uni thanks somewhat to Roger Horrocks,  Wystan Curnow, Murray
Edmond and Michelle Leggott: a lot of fascinating poetry as has been
introduced here and they dont conpletely rule out the Billy Collins of this
earth to a man or a woman I dont think...(?))] or even Creeley (although
Creeley would be better known)..now I can read Hughes, Heaney, who
else...many of the "official" poets but think that the most interesting are
from "the other side" eg the Black Mountain, the various NY Schools, the
Naropa, Spicer and the West coast writers and so on, Chris Stroffolino (!),
the Language Poets, some of the Vispos and many on this list if  I get time,
but Collins, Angelou, Rita Dove etc dont interest me so much...but "outside
the outside" there are a lot of fascinating writing, that, while it  "doesnt
interest me so much" it doesnt mean I dismiss it as 'bad" and so on...I dont
like Rod Mckuen though for example, and am not that enthusiastic about
cummings, although I see his importance and in New Zealand the "powers that
be"  often dont see (or sometimes dont want to see) other than people who
have won awards and so on: which somewhat I can understand...I understand it
if the general public were to be bemused by the contempt for Billy Collins
....its different if a poet such as Collins takes a definite stance against
aything outside his ken so to speak: as the Australian poets who did the Ern
Malley hoax did...they hated, with an almost lethal hate, "modernism" as tey
called it  ... but if a poet such as Collins just does his thing, as they
say, and is open to ideas: after all he is what he is, obviously he must
have someting going for him, no (?)...the problem is that some really
incredible poets get overlooked because eg Les Murray writes (a very good as
it happens) poem about a man crying: but Les Murray and probably Collins
ultimately have nothing new to add to the debate so to speak: contrast the
language poets including Ron Silliman and all those in In The American Tree
and also Post Modern American Poets and others around (you know who you
are!) and also in NZ some poets such as myself !! who are overlooked and
sadly neglected geniuses like Schubert...(cough cough)...or unneglected like
Goethe "meer Licht!  meer Licht!" (not that I can read German or have read
any Goethe to my shame ) ...but all is not well in the Langpo and associated
camps...there are some unresolved contradictions...but that aside (at least
that means hopefully the debate is continuing) (and know that we have to
explicate what it is we dont like about Collins's poetry etc and the
politico social financial factors etc etc operating: we cant just say "he's
bad" (we can but that doesnt help those people who are kind of thinking
about these matters, or are intelligent laymen, students at a certain level,
people just encountering poetry etc )...Ron Silliman's Blog and eg Jacket
look (I havent looked much but what I have seen looks good) like writings
and places that are developing.....whereas one feels somewhow - maybe it
doesnt matter -  that such as Collins (brilliant as he may be) are "going
nowhere"....

Billy Collins might have read "about" Berrigan (and his usage of
amphetamines etc and pepsi) just as people looking in to "us" might see us
talking about Mr Collins and his nice eyes  and so on...and not his
poetry...and so on.  Mabe we should invite him to explain his philosophy re
Berrigan on this List ...and hopefully he wouldnt get "flamed"....maybe.

A few irresolves.  Richard Taylor.

Richard, if Collins really does have a "philosophy re
Berrigan" I'll eat George Bowering's hat.

perl is as good as any for this sort of work. It has an extensive library of
modules - http://www.cpan.org/ - which has a lot of text processing modules. At
it's very heart is a pattern-matching library (Regular Expressions)- it is very
much text-based.

I recommend the O'Reilly book "mastering regular expressions". I'd also get the
O'reilly Perl book (the camel one), plus the one on Perl patterns.

I would also rec hanging around comp.lang.perl.misc - there's a fount of
knowledge thereabouts and they're always willing to help people.

If you look in the Kernigan & Pike book "The Practice Of Programming", they give
examples of implementing a Markov Chain in C, but also (I seem to recall) in
Java. They might include Perl examples, but you can easily translate the C into
Perl. It's also a good book to read and apply: perl can become a little complex
over large programs so I always think it wise to adopt a good methodology when
using this language. For the professional programmer having to maintain perl
over a period of years, perl has it's pitfalls. I currently help maintain a perl
program of some 20K lines.

However, with that caveat, I think it's the ideal choice for your kind of work.
B/C me if you want any advice.

Stephen Vincent in an earlier posting made a distinction between Spicer and
Duncan's "nature" and Rexroth's.  He further qualified that distinction by
adding that Spicer and Duncan's "nature" differed from each other's.  I
asked for some clarification about Spicer's use of nature in his poetry,
because--from what I can recall, since I don't have Spicer's books with me
in Japan--I never really considered Spicer a nature poet.  I could
understand his ref. to Duncan, but the inclusion of Spicer intrigued me.  I
did not try to equate location with the use of nature in poetry.  That could
have been Stephen's bag, but it was never mine.  Jess

Thanks for the link to my neighbor at eskimo.com. Other people had
told me there was someone else there interested in new writing, but
they didn't have a URL.

&, except that Burning Press isn't the same as Burning Deck, this
looks like a great site.

Hope you're doing well.

Hi Gerald,

Though Cid's OKU No HOSOMICHI is considered one of the best English
translations of Basho's classic and Cid is known for his translations of
Kuzano Shimpei's poetry as well as haiku from any number of Japanese haijin,
classical and modern, he suffers what every foreign person who lives here
suffers.  We are all OUTSIDERS.  Cid's Japanese poet and artist friends have
almost all died and Cid and Shizumi pretty much live by themselves.  There
are visitors, of course, but most of them are "foreigners" from outside
Japan.  What a tragedy!  Here is one person who has done so much to promote
an understanding of Japanese literature among English speakers and he is not
recognized by the very people he has served so well.

If Cid were an outside "expert" coming to Japan for a few days, weeks, or a
month or two, he would be an honored guest.  Since he's made Japan his home
on and off for 50 years, he's just another Gaijin.

Have you met said Collins?  He must have a philosophy: all men (meaning
beings) have philo sophies, so, ergo, thou must consume G B's hat.
Everyone..nay , in fact my cat has a philosophy: it has a philosophy of
being a cat and always going where its most dangerous to a human and it: so
even Mr Collins must have a philo sophy.... so you must comsume, partake of,
ingest, swallow, chew, crunch, munch, bite, tear at, savage, maul, and
othewise dispose of Monsieur Bowering's hat for which he must be compensated
or another hat replaced which is a reasonably complete simulacrum or
approximation  of the hattedness of the lauriat or is it (lariat?) royal of
Greater Canada: or I'll set Jonah Lomu the rugby giant (Samoan-Kiwi) onto
you.... (albeit he has kidney problems he's probably much bigger than any of
us..and much younger.....and worth a lot more...in money terms ...)  ....
Berrigan wrote bean spasms...now; put THAT to Bill Collins...that'll put the
wind up him! In more ways than one! I'll give you Billy Collins hasnt got a
Berrigan flosofy! Coarse e as!  Judge that one.... Yours as ever. I havent
read anyting by Monsieur Collins so cant comment ...but he's certainly
copping some flak. Richard.

Apologies for cross-posting

Among the printed material Bob Cobbing left behind, there is a significant
amount relating to the activities of Association of Little Presses etc

This can be catalogues or newsletters or the magazine (Poetry and Little
Press Information or PALPI) or notices and listings of one kind or another

Now in one way such materials date really quickly - publishers' lists and
addresses change, sometimes rapidly, projects end - but from another point
of view the documents are an invaluable research source for anyone
interested in little magazines

we intend keeping at least one copy of everything for the archive we are
assembling of Bob Cobbing's work. In many cases that's all there is; but
some items exist in quantity

If no one wants them, they can be recycled; but this is an enquiry to see if
anyone is interested in maintaining another archive

NB There is no list of such material yet - just let us know if you might be
interested; and, then, as we are able, we'll let you know

Poet Who Spoke Against Israel Is Reinvited to Talk at Harvard
By ROBERT F. WORTH


Citing concerns about freedom of speech, Harvard University's English
department has renewed an invitation to the Irish poet Tom Paulin to give a
lecture, just a week after he was disinvited for expressing strongly
anti-Israeli views.

The new invitation, approved in a vote on Tuesday night, drew sharply
differing responses from faculty members and students at Harvard, which has
been troubled by heated debates and demonstrations about Israel in the past
year. Some expressed relief, saying the university had crossed the line by
disinviting a poet because of his political views. Others were outraged and
said the decision would lead to renewed protests.

"I hope that those who choose to attend the planned reading will respect the
rights of those who wish to hear the speaker," Harvard's president, Lawrence
H. Summers, said yesterday in a statement.

Mr. Paulin's invitation was rescinded on Nov. 12 after students, faculty
members and alumni expressed outrage about comments Mr. Paulin made to an
Egyptian newspaper in April. He said Brooklyn-born Jews who had settled in
the West Bank "should be shot dead," adding, "I think they are Nazis,
racists; I feel nothing but hatred for them."

Mr. Paulin did not respond to messages left at Columbia University, where he
is a visiting faculty member this fall, but he has said that his views have
been distorted and that he does not support attacks on Israeli citizens
under any circumstances.

Mr. Summers released an approving statement after the invitation was
rescinded. But the decision to disinvite Mr. Paulin prompted a rebuke from
three professors at Harvard Law School: Alan M. Dershowitz, Laurence H.
Tribe and Charles Fried.

In a joint letter published in The Harvard Crimson, they wrote that
rescinding the invitation simply because it would be divisive was a "truly
dangerous" precedent.

Mr. Paulin is likely to accept the invitation, said James Shapiro, a
professor at Columbia who knows him.

Faculty members at Harvard expressed a variety of responses to the English
department's decision.

"The purpose of a university is to see a variety of points of view," said
Patrick Cavanagh, a psychology professor who signed a petition calling for
Harvard to divest from companies doing business in Israel. "Here's a man
who's a wonderful poet, and if his politics are more controversial, that's
really beside the point."

Jay M. Harris, a professor of Jewish studies, called the invitation
unconscionable. "Nobody is stopping him from exercising his First Amendment
rights," he said. "But an invitation from Harvard is different. We wouldn't
invite David Duke to speak."

For some, Mr. Paulin's political statements is complicated by his history of
linking literature and politics. Mr. Paulin, who grew up in Belfast, has
criticized the poet Philip Larkin as racist, and in a review several years
ago wrote approvingly of a book that criticized T. S. Eliot as anti-Semitic.

For some of Mr. Paulin's defenders, remarks like that prove that his
rhetorical attacks on Israel are not anti-Semitic. Others say Mr. Paulin had
simply invoked a standard that could and should be used against him.

"You can't say both things at the same time without there being a paradox,"
said Rita Goldberg, a lecturer on literature at Harvard, referring to Mr.
Paulin's earlier critiques of anti-Semitism and his comments about Israel.

Jesse: Just to re-iterate & clarify "Stephen's bag" re Spicer, this is what
I posted as a #2 to a double post with the other focus on Rexroth:
"As to Spicer and Nature and Jesse's question. I don't want to say nature
is not present as a "real" in Spicer's work, though, it seems to me that
natural artifice is used most frequently as metaphor, as a means of opening
an internal network of psychic and personal associations. It is the branch
that scratches the heart, etc. Though certainly Aquatic Park on the edge of
the Bay was a launching ground from some of the great works, Letters to
Lorca, for example. Those are real Sea Gulls. However, in terms of larger
California as an integral space, I am always momentarily shocked when he
gets as far as Stinson beach, or finds himself in a bar outside Riverside. I
find these as kind of counter-claustrophobic moments in the space of his
work. His containment within very specific spaces I suspect is an issue of
psycho-biography - I suspect part of it goes to an enormous sense of
vulnerability outside the relative safety of his city routines and literary
circle. HOWEVER, to say that he was oblivious to Nature would be stupid.
Apparently he read Robinson Jeffers in depth and I think the following is a
great poem from Language in the terms we're discussing:

   A redwood forest is not invisible at night. The blackness
covers it but it covers the blackness.

   If they had turned Jeffers into a parking lot death would
have been eliminated and birth also. The lights shine 24 hours a
day on a parking lot.

    True conservation is the effort of the artist and the private
man to keep things true. Trees and the cliffs in Big Sur breathe
in the dark. Jeffers knew the pain of their breath and the pain
was the death of a first-born baby breathing.

    Death is not final. Only parking lots.

_______
In 1968, during the demonstrations for People's Park in Berkeley, and three
years after his death, I asked Clifford Burke to print the poem as a
broadside (on green paper) and it was handed out as a free poem on Telegraph
Avenue. Ironically, Graham MacKintosh, Spicer's friend and printer of White
Rabbit Press books, later told me, "Jack would have hated street people." So
there you go. Sometimes you have to liberate poems into the presence of the
public weal, the poet's control - dead or alive -  be damned."

Without taking the time in a busy morning to go back into Peter Gizzi's
excellent book, and Kevin K and Lew Ellingham's biography, I am
re-remembering at least a Duncan notion, I believe, of a poetry in this City
as a redemptive spiritual site, a community of poets in which (implicitly)
Blazer, Spicer and Duncan were variously reigning bishops (of sorts!). In
any case the activity was not vernacular based. None of the poets - to my
perhaps limited knowledge - every showed up at a Planning Commission
meeting. San Francisco State Poetry Center politics -of which Duncan and
Ruth Diamant were co-founders in 1952 - however, was definitely a part of
conviction and play. Rexroth, on the other hand, was definitely located in
the push and shove of vernacular/material world (undoubtedly he was
cognizant/involved with battles at City Hall).  This curious separation
between poetry as spiritual - and not political - behavior was most evident
in the political upheavals of the late sixties in which it was really hard
to make correspondences between Duncan's work (when he was asked to read
publicly) and the realities of struggles on the street. The work appeared to
be up on the moon. (Which is not to say he was not personally sympathetic
and supportive of the left and against the old guard). George Oppen's work -
also then a local - had a much more "material" resonance.

This all takes me back to Barry Watten's take on Cities (Detroit and LA) as
contexts/spaces - the materiality of which - reflects a continuous evolving
site in which poetry and art - particularly photography in the last 30 years
- is actively engaged in the dynamics of politics, architecture,
advertising, economics, race, etc. The City is a site (perhaps a form of
nature?)that offers much different visceral challenge to the language
(poetry) than a literary/spiritual based one.

I thank you Jesse and others for keeping this discussion a bit alive. I
think it's an important one.

Stephen Vincent

for someone who says theyve dropped out of the scene, yr listening
pretty close to the buzz, luigi...

pataliterator was created in hypercard using hypertalk.  I still work
in a copy of hypercard I have from 92, & now that there is a rumor that
hypercard is being taken up again & ported to the net who knows...
also the new supercard can read hypercard stacks & play them on the net
with a plugin.

PATALITERATOR allows you to put -emic text strings into fields & then
create a library of possible patterns.  really the function of that
particular stack is that you can push a button & come back four hours
(or so) later & it will have created a language based on yr inputted
-emes & generated a 40 to 80 page unique one of a kind book based on a
simple random parsing of the patterns.  what could be more !pata that
no two books alike.

Hi! Just a reminder, if you can help out an elderly writer/professor couple
who need an apartment (1 to 2 bedrooms) to live permanently in Brooklyn,
Queens, or Manhattan for $1200 or under. (I know that it is impossible to
find) BUT still, if you can, you would be doing a wonderfully good deed.
Thanks so much. Thanks so much to the people who contacted me. Either the
rent was higher than $1200 or it was too far away. These two are wonderful,
vibrant, and intellectually stimulating individuals. You would love having
them as your neighbor. Please pass this along.
Best regards,
Prageeta

> BW focuses on media misrepresentation, but isn't there a more essential
question, to wit: What is poetry able to communicate about political life
that isn't already present among the contending points of view?  We have
already been served large helpings of satire and clownishness, and no minds
have been changed.  Why should a reader looking for guidance on U.S. foreign
policy turn to poetry instead of the NY Times editorial pages (or to any of
the websites that Patrick Herron has been citing)?

> I think there are ways to answer these questions.  Take the issue of
homelessness.  This has been, I think, one of the most common topics chosen
by poets who wish to engage social questions: maybe because it manifests
itself on an individual (that is, lyric) scale.  Heather Fuller writes about
homelessness, with some success, in Dovecote (the dovecote, one notes, is a
figure for communal shelter).  I think the value of these lines, from "Trip
Set," derives from the psychological honesty of the speaker and, just as
importantly, the humor and weirdness of some of the writing.  Rather than
merely show off the poet's personal charm or daffiness, this weirdness has
the scent of another person's actual life:
>

>

>

>
> it's easier to cry for the anonymous
> neighborhood burning down
>
> an action in missing
>
> Honesty (the speaker's admission that, when she gets a little cash, she
finds excuses to keep it for herslf) and authenticity (the ex-mental
patient's lisp -- how strange) embodied in the speech of our time ("good
place for a letter bomb"): these things are at home on lyric terrain.  The
lines do not, I think, offer much in the way of social analysis, but then
that may be beside the point.  Perhaps lyric candor and a spirit of inquiry
into other people's lives ("follow him...") are enough.

I met Billy Collins last year at an event I hosted.  Liked him quite a bit,
was a very unpretentious, darkly wry and funny guy.

Every time I drink a Pepsi (or read the NY POST) I think about Berrigan and
those great poems.  Pepsico should start a Berrigan poetry grant, for all
the product placement they've gotten over the years.

BILLY COLLINS


The small beads of grease
riding the soup-sheen
are all I have.

I would suck them up
and forget the soup.
They are orange as kerosene

as if they spilled from a farm house
deep in the soup.
Maybe I will put my eye down
close to the grease waves
and try to see the fields

and the distant churchyard
in the chicken noodle.

I will wave to the farm girl
waiting for her mama, and think
what a lank silo of love

will meet her
in those fields.

i never meant to say billy collins was a bad
guy...simply reporting my impressions...
one of the reaons i asked him was i see the influence
of berrigan on collins' work...collins' work seems
like a flat berrigan to me...while mr berrigan's work
of course is always fresh...
///berrigan was at the time and still is one of my
favorites, and i'm sure many here feel the same
way////there's such a manic kindness glwing from those
poems, which is what really touched me about them from
the very beginning...& one can learn a great deal
about living by reading mr berrigan's work...
one could also learn a lot about living reading
collins, but collins just isn't to my taste
somehow...granted, there are some clever moments in
much of his work, but it all seems too...well,
clever...i always sense an emptiness in collins' work,
which is actually pretty linear and straighforward
much of the time, which i never got from berrigan's
work, which, while often not being linear and at times
anything but straighforward, often touched me with a
huge depth beneath what would in lesser hands (like
mine) be pyrotechnics...yes, i prefer berrigan to
ashbery, which is not to say ashbery isn't
wonderful///& i prefer berrigan to (gasp!) o'hara,
though o'hara too has much to teach....

After this:

{Who, after all, would want poems to make things simpler than they
are. President Bush, maybe, or the aforementioned Mr Collins.}

Halvard writes:

Or maybe Mr. Einstein.

"Everything should be made as simple as possible,
           but not simpler."
                            --Albert Einstein

I Reply:

It's the "simpler" that's the case, the issue, with certain turns of
language in politcs / news / art. Not the "simple as possible" with
which I agree. And with which we all probably could agree?

PS. I survived reading a copy of Collins' _Picnic Lightening_, but I
found nothing there to trouble me into wakefulness.

I don't know if I read about unloading
that truck this morning or. Smoking

with a dim wink of vague sky scrolling
over my face and hands, glasses and

goatee, slice of Swiss in my teeth for they're

moving poems off the blotter and into the signshop,
where Hugh Heffner, all a-dribble with building,
simulates a talent search with a reach to land

unculled from any guidebook's preface. Eyes

know if these boxes come with anything more

analogous to the present than this. Rain. Ammonia.

Canada to U.S.: Mind your business

Don't tell us how to run our military, defence minister admonishes U.S.
president. Second Canadian official calls Bush'a moron' for pushing Iraq
onto NATO agenda

Robert Fife
The Ottawa Citizen


Thursday, November 21, 2002
ADVERTISEMENT


PRAGUE -- Defence Minister John McCallum bluntly told George W. Bush
yesterday to stop lecturing Canada about increased defence spending after
the U.S. president urged the federal government and the NATO allies to
boost their military budgets to confront new international threats from
terrorism and rogue states.

The Bush administration, particularly through Paul Cellucci, its
ambassador to Canada, has been calling on Canada to increase defence
spending and to purchase new heavy-lift aircraft so it does not have to
rely on the U.S. to transport Canadian troops.

Mr. McCallum said yesterday he is fed up with the Americans hectoring
Canada about its low defence expenditures, even though he himself has been
publicly lobbying for greater military spending.

"I would not urge the president of the United States or the U.S.
ambassador to Canada to do my job to ask for more defence spending. I
think that is a Canadian matter," Mr. McCallum told reporters.

He added: "I think a number of Canadians were a little bit ticked off when
the ambassador keeps pushing."

"It is a made-in-Canada decision, so while Mr. Bush may be asking for what
I am asking for, I am not asking for his help."

On the eve of today's opening of the 19-member NATO summit in the Czech
capital, Mr. Bush made an impassioned appeal for the western alliance to
strengthen its military "to confront terror camps in remote regions or
hidden laboratories of outlawed regimes."

Mr. Bush said NATO needs to develop new capabilities, including a
21,000-member rapid reaction force, more special forces, better precision
weapons and more modern command structures if it is to win the war against
global terrorism and rogue states, like Iraq.

The president did not directly name Canada, but it has the third-lowest
military budget in the NATO alliance, spending more than only Luxembourg
and Iceland, which does not have a military.

"NATO forces must be better able to fight side by side. Those forces must
be more mobile and more swiftly deployed," he told the Atlantic Youth
Council. "For some alliance members, this will require higher defence
spending. For all of us, it will require more effective defence spending
with each nation having the tools and technology to fight and win a new
kind of war."

At a later news conference, Prime Minister Jean Chrétien would not comment
on Mr. Bush's appeal, other than to say he would like to pump more money
into the military, but the government has many other priorities.

"Me too, I would like to spend more money on defence. I'd like to spend
more money on everything, but we have to make these decisions when come
the budget," he said.

Earlier in the day, a senior Canadian official, who asked not to be
identified, called Mr. Bush "a moron" because of his efforts to push the
war against Iraq to the top of NATO's agenda. The summit was to focus on
expansion and moderation of the alliance, but Mr. Bush has used his clout
to make Iraq the dominant issue at the meeting.

NATO Secretary General Lord George Robertson and the Liberal-dominated
defence committees of the House of Commons and the Senate have all
deplored Canada's $12-billion military budget, which represents only 1.1
per cent of gross domestic product spending, half the NATO average of
2.13.

But Canadian officials argued the "pure GDP numbers is a pretty crude
indicator" of Canada's military capabilities, noting the Canadian military
has played a role in almost every major United Nations or NATO operation
from Bosnia to the war in Afghanistan.

Mr. Chrétien also picked up on that theme, saying the Americans appreciate
the role that Canada has played in operations around the world.

"The Americans always compliment when we participate with them. When we
were in Kosovo, we were the third country with the greatest number of
sorties and we were complimented by everyone there by the effectiveness of
our troops. We did the same thing in Bosnia. In Afghanistan, our troops
did very well," he said.

Mr. Bush said NATO, devised as a static defence against the former Soviet
Union, is outdated and its military forces are incapable of responding
quickly to military threats outside Europe, such as Afghanistan.

"When forces were needed quickly to operate in Afghanistan, NATO's options
were limited," he said.

"The allies need more special operations forces, better precision strike
capabilities and more modern command structures. Few NATO members will
have state-of-the-art capabilities in all of these areas, I recognize
that, but every nation should develop some."

The Senate defence committee recently called for a $4-billion annual
increase in the Armed Forces budget, while Liberal MPs on the Commons
defence committee have urged the prime minister not to sacrifice Canada's
military to fund a social agenda.

But officials close to Mr. Chrétien say he's reluctant to approve a
substantial boost in spending for Canada's Armed Forces, preferring to
pump money from the federal surplus into social programs and
infrastructure improvements for cities.

Mr. McCallum has been seeking a modest increase in the defence budget of
$1 billion and is prepared to find savings of up to $250 million from
within the Defence department, sources say.

Since 1994, the government has reduced defence spending by 23 per cent and
cut the Forces' regular personnel to 57,000 from 87,600 in 1990. Canada
has the world's 54th-largest military and 77th-largest reserve force, even
though it has the 34th-largest population and is a member of the Group of
Seven industrialized nations.

A bevy of military analysts, most recently the Council on Canadian
Security in the 21st Century and the Atlantic Institute, have also warned
Canada is at risk of being unable to defend itself unless it increases
spending. Military experts say Canada needs to double its equipment budget
to $3.5 billion annually just to replace aging equipment.

Behind the scenes, Defence department officials readily acknowledge that
military capability has suffered while other allies, in particular the
United States, have made substantial improvements.

I was wondering if, setting aside the recent 100-million-dollar gift to Poetry
Magazine as a gift not to the many but to the few (as has been shown), I might send
out a general inquiry as to the proper response to the statement, "There's not much
money in poetry." (Which is usually a response to a vague statement of purpose,
offered by way of being sociable or in response to the desperate question, "So what
do you do?") This statement has a lot of close and distant cousins: the wide-eyed
stare, accompanied by "But you can't make a living as a poet!"; the squintily ironic
"Bet there's a lot of money in poetry..."; or the cordial nod and slight wrinkling
of the brow, followed by "Ah yes, but what do you REALLY do?"

Max Winter

ps: I think I forgot to mention the distant relative, "You have to be kidding,"
which usually appears with a dropped jaw. Or the antagonistic uncle: "Is that all
you do?" Or the expectant grandfather: "But what's your job-job?" Or the
not-so-sympathetic sympathetic aunt, "It's a difficult time for that."

Richard,

I think what is meant is that Collins doesn't have a very self-conscious
philosophy.  The way you put it, it seems like we have philosophies like
we have brains.  However, the yobs who go to the sports bar and cheer at
the football hoards do not strike me as people having a "philosophy" in
the robust sense.  At least, not one worthy of discernment.  It's one
thing to be egalitarian;  it's another to give people credit when all they
are doing is breathing.

Of course, one of the problems in having this discussion is that the most
prominent American philosophy, pragmatism, is, in the words of Cornel a
successful "evasion of philosophy."  Saying you don't have a theory is
american as apple pie.

Robert

The point is that both difficulty (opaquenes etc or absorption) and
"simplicity" are tactics or strategies as they say.....if I think of Chess:
against certain opponents I
used to simplify and win the (deceptively!) easy endings with attacking
players (who got bored by the apparent simplicity!) whereas against a more
cautious player I would attack and against someone who loved analysing and
analysing I used to play moves that required several reasonable and
interesting alternatives: thus usally ensuring I got a time  advantage!!!!
But the parallel from Chess to literature or even science is that a poet may
know that a) he/she likes complexity (not always)  b) sometimes the simple
(deceptively) is a "winner" eg in Langpo the "trilobites" thing is it by the
"jazzy" Clark Coolidge (?) and somehwere in between I've just been reading
Fair Realism by Barbara Guest which is a bit more resisitive but as they say
not so much maybe as Armantrout or Bernstein etc...and some of the "late
modernist" poets are complex in the sense they have a 'complex message'
whereas the "complexity" of others is part of a methodology: my feeling is
that of the "simple" poems that I think are awesome
 there is eg  Blake's "Tyger"  (but that is not as "simple as it seems) and
the "simplicity" or the more direct language of Williams (again not as
"simple" as it seems) are all strategies directed both by the writer
(player)) and also the social-cultural-political-historical situation he/she
is in and her/his own sense of what is required or what the writer feels
must be written by that artist...people say things like that, like simplify
things...yes but the process is often complex (yet when all steps are seen
is not) so a major poem for me must be rich,strange, complex and simple (if
required) and I think that that which has multiplex meaning levels and
challenges is most appealing to me: and go beyond the sum of these "steps"
or parts; in fact all thsi is know n and has been talked about by otthers
from Pound and Eliot to Empson the Langpos and many many others...eg given
that one can enjoy Browning's
"Sordello"   (or the idea of it ) or Geoffrey Hill and also J H Prynne and
maybe even monsieur  b collins as well as: who...me(!), Bill Smith,
yourself, the langpos, ted berrigan of the Sonnets and his "card poems",
Sondheim (or at least the idea of Sondheim),and those poets publishing on
this List every day....

I think there is a danger for some people to obssess on puzzles and number
crunching and symbolising and references and analogies and structures which
is ok - it can be great: eg Zukofsky and multiple others - as long as the
result isnt someone who jumps off a bridge: its ok if the personal life is
kept reasonably direct and "simple" ('bad' word)...Ron Silliman strikes me
as someone who can have showers and think clean thoughts about John Ashbery
and talk to his kids and also write the Blogg and possibly is a considerable
poet
(oops another bad word!) and also talk nonsense to me back channell in a
friendly and (is it only a?) humouring  way, whereas Nick Piombino mutters
darkly about "that dammed Taylor with his crazy politics and his chutzpah!"
and so on  and George Bowering (who invented the word "chutzpah") can have
his hat and it be eaten or masticated, yet write some (apparently, I havent
had the pleasure) wonderful poems....he is, I have heard,  SIMPLY the
greatest poet to have ever been be-hatted in Canada......in fact my friend
Leicester Kyle
(an ex Anglican Priest) who inhabits the Buller area of the South Island NZ
has also been made a kind of  poet lauriat by the local council who were
excited to find a "real poet" in their area and are paying for a book or so
for him to publish!! ...so even for such as Leicester who also always wears
a black hat and looks quite cool as the kids say today: and often black
jeans
and a white beard and blue eyes...is making his way towards the
complexsimplicity of being a behatted and significant poet in NZ. Whether he
will ne a collingianical or a sillymaniacal poet only time can
reveal.....despite or because of his hat.

Anselm,

My Pepsi post was ~in no way~ meant to impugn Ted
Berrigan's poetry or his life.  My post-text was meant
solely as an ironic, art-for-art's-sake, autonomous,
absurdist joke that in no way ever had Ted Berrigan
(or reality) in mind, and cast no aspersions against
him or anyone else . . .

. . . including Caleb Bradham, the inventor of Pepsi.

If my silly irony left any doubt as to my intentions
or there being any further "target," that's just the
fault of my own poor writing and I accept
responsibility while offering apology.

(I in fact am not well-read in Ted Berrigan's poetry
and had no idea as to how Collins' remark is or is not
borne out in its autobiographical particulars.)

The "punch-line" I meant in the humor of my post was
that it was terrified by Pepsi but said nothing
against dexedrine.

The idea of citing "Pepsi and dexedrine" at all struck
me as funny, as a form, that pairing of the
ubiquitously innocent (soda/pop) and a dangerous
controlled substance in one conjunction.  Like litotes
and hyperbole linked back-to-back.  I thought it would
be funny to elaborate that trope further (Collins
himself on Schweppes and aspirin, Ginsberg on Japanese
tea and bee pollen extract), so uninformative and
peripheral to comment upon someone's poetry by
commenting on the poet's diet and under-the-counter
intake.

The reductivism of a poetic value based on bottled
soft drink and pills.

Richard Howard's poems written on--- Snapple and nasal
decongestant.  Lewis LaCook's poems written on A & W
Root Beer and cough lozenges.  Keri Edwards' poems
written on Dr. Brown's Diet Cream Soda and breath
mints.  Alice Quinn's poems written on Slim Fast and
Prozac.  Tina Brown Celona's poems written on Yoo-Hoo
chocolate drink and Altoids.  My own poems written on
Celestial Seasonings peppermint tea and Clarinex.

So, no offense intended.

All I know is some funny shit when I see it. And that shit = funny.
It's made up of the things we are saying when we send these emails
to each other! I was about to ask the moderator to withdraw me,
but now that I see what I would be missing --

I even had a gracious farewell message all devised. "I still believe
in Poetics, etc." What I really believe in though is cracking up&
losing my shit, wherever I can get it. The French call it "cumming."
The knack of making others laugh rarely comes from happy sources.

Which is what makes it so SWEET!  thanks whomever --Bill?

09/02/02
a psuedo-random text-image generator
written in C++ with a JSP-like interface called a PrePage.
See "PrePageDoc.doc" for instructions on how to create a PrePage.

The NewsMaker is in effect an http 1.1 scraper.
It runs as a server listening on a well known port
and accepts requests from http clients.
The server then spawns a NewsMaker thread
to service the request. The response is generated
by selecting random keywords from news.google.com.
Then the thread uses these keywords as the basis for an "or"
query on www.google.com, images.google.com, and
news.google.com. The resulting google pages are scraped
for links. Then a percentage of those links are opened
and scraped for links, images, and paragraphs.
The thread then builds a random response by mixing
together these elements. On average, a NewsMaker
thread reads in 1 Mb of html from 50 websites
and returns a response to the client within three seconds.
The application is currently built out in debug mode
with heavy logging, so these figures could be improved
upon somewhat.

&#65279;this just in (and apologies for multiposting):

YARD reading
November 30th @ the Auburn Saloon
1st ST and 8th AVE SW
7:00 pm

this time around we are all implicated, crested and not-written.  it is a
symbol inside out.  non.  and we are fortunate to have such a night as this:

Trevor Speller:  fresh from his galapagos safari, Trevor promises to dazzle
an already spell-bound many with his dry martini talents loosely assembled
under the moniker--  for you, a moon-sized sentence (ed: he demanded more
hyphens.  I've argued him down to several).

Larissa Lai:  when the clock strikes it is unfit to ask--  "and so was that
perfume yours or am I an eloquent tachometer?"  maybe if we ask nicely and
with subtle insistence we will all shine from our seats as she reads from
her recently published and highly acclaimed novel, _Salt Fish Girl_(Thomas
Allen).  ps:  who's bringing the durian fruit?

Carol Malyon:  the rumours are all true.  Carol makes her way to Calgary
with _Colville's People_(Mercury) just in time to make the Auburn sing.

and to boot--  the december installment of YARD will have as its purpose the
idea of giving. collaborations, covers, and culinary exhibitionism are all
highly reccommended.  stay tuned for details.

any questions or comments?  let me know.

Richard,

It seems to me Collins is drawing such contempt because he is the poet
laureate. Why contempt, rather than indifference, is that not what you are
asking?

This is a sensitive reading of Ted Berrigan. I knew him a bit as I attended
his readings at the Poetry Project early on and also his workshop in 1967.
Since his poetry was then still mostly unavailable I went to the 42cd street
library and copied out many of his sonnets by hand. It warms me to hear and
see that the essence of the man can still be evoked from the poems long
after he left us. In his workshops Ted advised poets who wanted to be
actively involved in the poetry world to give readings. This was challenging
for me as I was intensely shy, yet his encouragement got me to push on.
Recently I began to put together a tape of selections of poetry readings
including some of Ted's for Tom Kelly who does a poetry radio show for WKCR.
Tom, who attends Columbia, is writing his undergraduate thesis on Ted
Berrigan. I have a hunch that Ted would have very much enjoyed this poetry
list. He seemed to have relished the public/private dichotomies and
paradoxes of being a poet. Part of his magic was to be able to communicate
in his witty, densely structured poems not only many of his ideas and
experiences, but also, by means of a unique combining of form and content,
gave us access (if we have, like lewis, an ear) to something of the flavor
and texture of his presence and, perhaps, his very being. And the thing is,
I still miss him.

It's a taller walk now that I've gotten
to begin myself. Again: when you put me down
on scalds pavement from my flesh

in reels, the jig remands a portal to
the young man bleeding black and long hair
all over his stoned clothes. Foreshortened
to emphasize the backdrop

you printed with such deliberation
all over my face and hands, we see his gait
across those inversions of faith

you sang shrilly into his baldnesses. That night
you didn't call because you were with someone
else: you thought he was dead. My bones scold
sidewalks you've forgotten, or still stand still.

I thought Collins was a metaphor?

Plus, who cares? Why spend so much time on a poet who's poetry you don't like?

  for some reason Im not able to let this go.  it seems like an off the
cuff simplification to say that good poems often make things more
difficult, maybe even inferring that "difficult poetry" (which we all
know & love) is intrinsically better.  its about where a reader is
coming from & what use they can make out of the experience of reading.
for me an iowa writer's workshop poem is far more difficult to contend
with that a poem by Bruce Andrews.  Aram Saroyan's poem "eyeye" has to
be one of the simplest poems on the planet, its beauty & "goodness"
having little to do with a notion of difficulty.

by the way George, its remarkable that youve this opportunity, now if
only a nation's literature can merge with a world's literature.

TOM COLLINS: A Cento
--from the original by Gabriel Gudding

forget the soup
and the distant churchyard
try to see the fields
they are all I have
as if they spilled from a farm house
close to the grease waves
deep in the soup
I will wave to the farm girl
suck them up
those fields
maybe I will put my eye down
riding the soup-sheen
the small beads of grease
orange as valvoline
what a lank silo of love
will meet her

i don't believe mself in trickle-down theories (of economics, what
have you) so i have a strong hunch that a tight lid will be put on
the lilly largesse... i would of course love to be proved wrong here,
but even if a few poor slobs (and 100 in this case constitutes a few)
end up with some quotient of the proceeds, the shame of it for me
will be what this MIGHT have amounted to for u.s. literary culture
across the board (as others have pondered)...

robert, armchair pragmatics as non- or anti-theory, you bet!... i
love pragmatism, don't love what has often been done to/with it... i
could relate here a little story about a flamewar i was at the
epicenter of on the old megabyte u (MBU) list---my first entry into
cyberspace, no less, debating with a comp practitioner of some note
who insisted that his pragmatic-empirical approach to the field
constituted no theory at all, as it wasn't falsifiable etc... my
response eventually took the regrettable form of suggesting that this

NOBODADDIES: A Journal of Piracy
NOBODADDIES is returning to publishing. Our first issue of the new
series will be published in the early summer 2003. If you are not
familiar with Nobodaddies and would like to support the journal as well
as gather a sense of the kind of work that we have published in the
past, send $5 for each issue (numbers 2 and 3 are still available).
Make checks payable to Doug Rice.
In this first issue back we are particularly interested in work that
questions boundaries of discipline, genre, and discourse. We like work
that calls into question contemporary theorizing of the postmodern
moment; work that is inappropriate. Essays that theorize plagiarism,
appropriation, allusion, critifiction, pirating of other texts. Nomadic
textualities that flee any sens of home and domesticity. Essays on
individual writers (Acker, Burroughs, Doubiago, Brossard, Maso, any of
the modernists), essays on music and film (in the styles or against the
styles of Frith, McRobbie, Marcus, Savage, and on and on......on
directors Godard, Ackerman, and others), essays on theorists (Deleuze,
Kristeva, Irigaray, Cixous, Derrida, Foucault, and on and on and on),
essays on photography ....
We are also looking for fiction and for B&W artwork.
In the past we have published David Blair, Takayuki Tatsumi, Lidia
Yuknavitch, Larry McCaffery, Laurie Weeks, Rebecca Brown, Ray Federman,
and others
Break rules
Our website will be up in early December 2002.

**Colleges Tightening Oversight of Parties for Poetry Recruits**

by Mike Freakman

Buffalo, Nov. 22 (AHP2 News) -- After a series of embarrassing incidents
and criminal investigations involving alcohol and theory at recruiting
parties for coveted high school poets in recent years, some universities
have begun to rewrite the rules for entertaining recruits and are
tightening their oversight.

These generally unofficial parties will reach a peak over the next few
weeks as hundreds of high school prospects visit major poetry colleges for
two days, trying to decide where to enroll next fall. Some university
officials, who had been criticized for failing to supervise the parties,
acknowledge that they felt compelled to take action after being embarrassed
by misbehavior associated with recruiting parties.

Earlier this year, for example, the University of Alabama was placed on
probation by the National Collegiate Poetry Association (N.C.P.A.) for
violations that included inviting theorists onto campus to entertain high
school poets at parties. A poetry recruit on an official visit to the
University of Florida was initially charged with plagiarism and disorderly
thinking two years ago for an incident that occurred after he attended a
party with heavy theory.

At the University of Michigan, a coveted high school senior was entertained
by Michigan poets with alcohol and theorists in a Detroit hotel suite six
years ago. When the university learned about the party, Michigan's
president felt compelled to apologize to the recruit's parents.

At Michigan State University, visiting high school prose poets were
entertained by theorists at a Detroit nightclub and other recruits taken to
a casino, where they practiced writing chance-derived works, leading the
N.C.P.A. to put the prose poetry program on probation for two years in 1998.

With the image of college poetry having been tarnished in recent years by a
number of incidents in which poets were charged with plagiarism and
copyright infringement, some critics contend that recruiting parties have
become a particularly insidious part of the problem.

"These parties are a major problem," said Thames Dumberthanthat, president
of the University of Michigan from 1988 to 1996. "And I can't say for
certain, but I think they are a problem at a number of universities, mainly
because these are high school kids away from home and there is a total lack
of supervision and structure. I was shocked when I heard about how they
were handled. They basically turn these kids loose and hope a great poem
will come out."

Though the parties are usually unofficial, they are often part of high
school poets' N.C.P.A.-sanctioned two-day visits to campuses. The high
school seniors usually get to meet critics and poets, go to readings, and
attend classes. At night, they are usually entertained by college poets
hoping to impress them.

Recruiting parties can be harmless fun, but they can also cross the line.
Players sometimes provide wine and theory to visiting high school seniors,
according to interviews with former poets, critics, law enforcement
officials and prose writers who have attended recruiting parties.
Sometimes, too, these people say, the older poets arrange for recruits to
have access to poems by George Bowering and David Bromige. "These kids are
not prepared for the effect of this kind of poetry, which is provided
without any historical context or information about the importance of
Canadian national identity for both poets," said Dan Joyisme, President of
the League for Poetic Improvement.

While the parties carry some legitimacy as part of university-sanctioned
campus visits, they are seldom supervised by university officials and often
take place off campus. As such, critics say, these parties carry murky
expectations for those who attend, often in a raucous atmosphere with
sensibilities dulled by wine or metaphor. "The long range problem," said
Mr. Dumberthanthat, "is that poetic intoxication will lead these young
people to think of poetry as a free pass to avoid serious pursuit of
college athletics." He noted that colleges with Division I poetry programs
often lowered athletic standards for top poets in an effort to keep them
enrolled.

In the past, many university officials have argued that they were not
responsible for misbehavior that occurred late at night in unofficial
settings. But many law enforcement officials, community officials and
leaders of poetry improvement groups contended that the colleges were at
fault for failing to properly supervise poets and their high school guests.

Well, while I'm not sure about the meanings, in the context of m.a.'s use,
of "mergings", I'll say that Lisa Robertson is a World poet, as is Lissa
Wolsak. When they read,they direct my attention to "our" life, not to
theirs. I hope m.a. isn't suffering from a self-imposed stereotyping of
"Canadian Literature".  DB

Hey all!

Heard through the shaking grapevine that poet Elizabeth Alexander and
scholar Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick pinpointed that  in Joseph Parisi's comments
on the $100 million gift to Poetry, he stated that "it would grow like
Topsy."

Now, Topsy is the little enslaved Black girl, friend of Little Eva and
charge of Miss Feely (Ophelia) from "Uncle Tom's Cabin," who, after stating
that she has no parents, declares that she "just growed."   (Ishmael Reed's
"Jes Grew")  She also declares that if she were "skinned" she'd be good, and
that "can't nobody love a n*gger," etc.  So, this cartwheeling, stealing,
candy-loving, godless autochthonous creature's development is one model for
the future development of "Poetry"?

Did anyone see this statement of Parisi's?

listening to the report of what "Lord Robertson" said to Russia about NATO
today, it sounded very much like an offer of protection, as in "protection"

they wouldn't like NATO being on their turf, sure; but finally they'd come
to see it was the safest way

oops, I just dropped your economy; how clumsy of me

Would it were to grow like William Morris & become a
juggernaut of interarts experimentation. ("Topsy" was
Rossetti's not very kind nickname for him.) But (I
guess in response to Joe) would $100 mil dropped in some
other lap (say Poetry, ca. 1915) be an unadulterated good
thing? Wasn't there a Twilight Zone episode where an imp
gave Ron Padgett $100 million and the St. Marks Poetry
Project turned into Starbucks? I think if I had $100 mil I'd
give $100,000 to 1,000 poets and let it grow topsy-turvy.

***Who Says There's No Money and Power in Poetry***

by Dirk Ashcroft

New York, Nov. 22 (Murdoch Wire)--"Deep down, poetry is boring," says poet
William Tomcollins, cruising in his S.U.V. through the streets of
Westchester.  "Particularly when we're at war, you have to reassure people,
and nothing does that better than poetry."  A genial fifty-something,
Tomcollins says he loves reading for politicians and foundation heads, but
that average Americans are still his main audience.

As Official Poet of the State of Iowa, Tomcollins has leveraged his position
to become one of the most widely read poets in the U.S.  "I still haven't
caught up with Jewel in terms of sales," Tomcollins says, as he sips
hurriedly from a large glass of Scotch.  "But in terms of demographics, I've
got her beat in the 35-55 independent-voter suburban bracket.  I used to get
a lot of sales from the Promise Keepers, but now that the movement's kind of
died down, my agent's been trying to get me on Oprah.  It's kind of hard now
that Jonathan Franzen blew it for the rest of us."

"People just want to know that they're OK, that the country's OK, that it's
OK to be who you are," says Tomcollins.  "Just because you like poetry doesn
't mean you're effeminate or intellectual.  In fact, poetry can be a
surprisingly good way to make a living.  If you can get in with the
foundations and the right publishers, that is. My friends now run the NEA,
the Guggenheim Foundation, and the country."  With respect to the last of
these, Tomcollins is referring, with characteristic understatement, to his
friendship with Dick Cheney, whom Tomcollins says has long been a closet fan
of his poetry.

When asked, Tomcollins shrugged off recent attacks upon his poetry on the
part of the Poet Laureate of New Zealand.  "In a time of war, we need unity
on the part of nations and poets.  I don't know what he said about me
because I don't take in negative energy, but whatever it was it was an
insult to the average ordinary working people of America."

He continues: "What billionaire ever donated $100 million to the poetry
elite of New Zealand?"  Collins is referring to a recent charitable gift to
Official Verse Magazine on the part of a billionaire heiress.  "That money
could have gone to all kinds of causes: reducing illiteracy in India,
providing AIDS drugs in Africa, funding thousands of arts organizations for
the half of the world's population who live on less than $2 a day.  But here
in America people know that poets and the life of the imagination are
important.  We need to support the people who sacrifice on behalf of
culture--like some of the poets I know who teach poetry workshops who are in
their 70s and 80s and have yet to win a lifetime achievement award.  Why
shouldn't we treat poets like CEOs?  After all, culture is an American
product like anything else."

Visibly flushed after this passionate defense of poetry, Tomcollins takes
another quick gulp and looks down into his glass of Scotch.  As if to
counter any impression that he is distressed--even if only for a moment--he
perks up.  "Deep down I'm an optimist, and I'm living the American dream. If
I could do it in politics--I mean, make this much money, work this little,
and have so many adoring female fans--I'd run for congress.  But hey," he
says with a wink, "I get to read poems and everyone in congress listens, it'
s all bipartisan, and we can all be reassured by the enduring power of
poetry."

"Simple"? "Difficult"?

 I know some who find Saroyan's "eyeye" utterly opaque and/or trivial, a
variety of bafflegab to be dismissed. Arcane, perhaps. Certainly (or
uncertainly) "difficult".
But "simple", "difficult", and, well, "arcane", are (like a lot of other
large abstractions) very slippery terms indeed, no?

I thought, it seems wrongly, that the Canadian Poet Lariat's assumption
was that "nothing is as simple as it appears." Or rather, "as it appears
to be."

("Appears", note; "to be", note. Two very tricky words/phrases indeed,
neither at all simple, slide all over the shop. Surely one need not
invoke Heidegger to see that.)

I share the Great Canadian Cowboy Poet's assumption (assuming I've read
his remark, er, um, _correctly_. . . .), and
 Aram Saroyam's poem confirms that assumption, I'd have thought.

Need I add that some poems, which appear "difficult", turn out to be
"simpler" than their writer thought or hoped, and thereby disappoint
their reader?

This is an argument (?) (disagreement?) (?) over the meaning of
(un)certain terms.

excuse, please, the rhetorical shriek quotes above, but I think I needed
them, rhetorically anyway.

  for some reason Im not able to let this go.  it seems like an off the
cuff simplification to say that good poems often make things more
difficult, maybe even inferring that "difficult poetry" (which we all
know & love) is intrinsically better.  its about where a reader is
coming from & what use they can make out of the experience of reading.
for me an iowa writer's workshop poem is far more difficult to contend
with that a poem by Bruce Andrews.  Aram Saroyan's poem "eyeye" has to
be one of the simplest poems on the planet, its beauty & "goodness"
having little to do with a notion of difficulty.

by the way George, its remarkable that youve this opportunity, now if
only a nation's literature can merge with a world's literature.

SOME THINKING


Does all art aspire to the condition
of music?  -  While someone

is always prepared to say so I put on
a tape, a CD, *instead* of writing

or put it on to write to  -
& that is as far as the art gets.

A tape rolls quietly  -  "Light Blue",
"Soul Eyes"  -  to which I've done

a lot of reading, a lot
of pottering about, some drawings  -

& to which I've 'cleaned house'  -

& a lot of writing  -  or 'trying to write',
which comes to the same thing.  Mal Waldron wrote

both these tunes.
                I first heard of him
in the poem for Billie Holiday  -  "The Day

Lady Died", with the great last lines
where she whispers to him across the keyboard

"& everyone & I stopped breathing."
The great thing

about the line is the uncertainty: is it "everyone
& I stopped breathing"? or that Holiday whispers the song

"to Mal Waldron & everyone"  -  & it is *then* O'Hara
"stopped breathing"?

It makes for a pause, a hesitation, a number of them  -
that evokes the magic & tension

of her timing.  And there's Frank, leaning there
-  near the door to the toilets?  The 'john',

which always suggests the hard American 50s  -
& ensures I think of him in a white shirt & narrow tie,

suited.  Already the texture of life is disappearing
-  exactly how it felt, to be in those suits, in that time, at a nightclub

how anxious or not, how preoccupied & with what  -
how people held themselves  -  is gone.  Well,

it survives somehow, unverifiably, hard to quantify,
in poetry =8A  we still have the music, films  -

but films lie.  Cassavetes suggests the era to me  -
was he 'the type' of the hipster  -  cool, up tight, hip, witty  -

suited, a drinker, free, & maybe more exploratory  -
within limits more circumscribed than now?

Or do we always see ourselves as more free
& get it wrong?  Did he

& O'Hara meet ever?
Different worlds.

The thing I was going to say about nightclubs
was that maybe how people feel & act in them

never changes.  (I heard some magical things
at Lark & Tina's, for example.  I've been as tense

as anyone, at the Cargo Club  -  & wore suits there.)
But night clubs themselves might've changed with the music:

amplified is different?  the fashion for recorded
dance music or for dee-jays, might have altered them.

On tape one of the moments I like best is the voice  -
a little shakey, a little spaced  -  Jim Carroll's by repute,

asking for tuinols, in the space between songs, at a great
Patti Smith gig.  Or Velvet Underground  -

they're both on that tape.  There's some great
& wonderfully casual, relaxed things said, over the music,

at a late 50's date that features Miles Davis
guesting with local hero Jimmy Forrest: a type of music, & experience,

continuous with the live recordings of Charlie Parker  -
the same carefree ambience & same reason to pay attention

whereas Patti's music gets to you pretty much
whether you listen or not.  You don't have to choose of course.

"Jesus died for somebody's sins but not mine"
is always great to hear said.  This track,

the badly named "Soul Eyes" (how can you not roll it
into one word?), is not live but so sad & so unhurried

it makes *time*, development, almost its subject.  John
Coltrane.  Well within his limits  -  *as*

somehow imagined  -  & great the way conservative paintings
by great artists often are  -  a Gauguin still-life

that looks as though it wants to be Manet, or Fantin-Latour.

Despite all the identity politics going on, I am not interested in a
nation's literature. I AM interested in a country's literature. I
guess this is akin to admitting being a patriot while refusing to be
a nationalist.

Murat.   Somewhat...Collins and ceratian poets .... well there are many very
good poets .......but they do noting fundamentally new for  the art: or in
some way they are repeating...this can lead  ceratain poets being
"neglected' or seen in the wrong way because they are not  "interesting"
(although maybe some are simply not so..but  my very good friend and fellow
inebriate Bob Orr (considered by some, I say some,to   be possibly (in term
of inherent talent) to be possibly Auckland's "best" ( he is Auckland's
unofficial lauraeate)   ( I saw him to night actually) and maybe New
Zealand's (best poet) although these judgements are moot: but he is not
maybe 'groundbreaking' or whatever the term is...should he be
ignored?...no...but certainly not contempt: all poets have something to say:
we should listen (and read) carefully....

It is also a  fact that the very position invites attack or
grumbling.....Billy Collins the Laureate gets a lot of exposure and has
influence: but I dont feel we should be so heavy on him: criticise
yes..point is that to know what is "electric" or startlignly original and
innovative etc we need to evaluate the other writer: there is in fact a
great range of writers...without studying him though I'm dubious of a poet
who makes simplistic remarks re Ted Berrigan (if he did): a marvelous poet
(and Anslelm) I would say:  was  wonderful father....but as I say we need to
look more "objectively at these guys...my disquisition of and on Baraka
wasnt because I liked his poetic mode ...but what he was saying and his
right to say it interested me and also the fact that he is radical and
afro-american and so on...  we need to somehow "ignore" the laureate status
for critical purposes...Rivhard

ageless spots mark time, marks time  as dots, dots of abalonian
everything underlined twice, v=d/t.  we have to choose the figure or
face, discipline or decimal point,  both dismal ports of call. abel's
last call  home.  or-or  something being similia siimilibus curantue,
or  congealed  lavender oil,  the people zarathustra dreamt  of
peopling  the heights  of silis-maria.  dionysius  continual
resurrection and polymorphous  hand-me-downs.  a bright spot  in
reverse hangs there before our eyes.  "are you sure  this is what you
see?"  from the murmuring center.  is it not the other thing, maybe
just a fragment,  an elongated torment,  something like water.  a
lesson in ambiance.  a failed field of forever  applied to spikes,
averting  rooftops,  or that all  invasive zero  put together like
flying a kite - to much of too frequent a good distraction compounded
in excessive thinking.  a  waffle orthodoxy which switches in between
their  would be and to dead batteries.  a local skinny hand puppet
declining either or both sides and skips the middle.  it's about a time
  that will never occur, nevertheless  the parts continue, there is a
racket stored in a perpetual rock, reliquariums  that talkitup.  rough
weather for disco, techno take warning.  I ordered a larger something
else -  dandy sweet heart pincushion (v'''''') _______,
___________, ____________, ___________, -  with corresponding numbers
invaded by a desire.  an ironic last holdout, last block, a super
holding pattern. in the evening  dismal sound  hovers 2 ft. before
everyone.  the fish does not want to be moved to pity.  in a lavender
an opening closes, there is  a snap, the aroma of precision holograms
plot thickens.  you are a moderate cause - you make plans - there are
three juggernauts in a row at the same time time happens.  again,
questions spring board, is it an accumulative respect? a passing fancy?
can you get   tongue and groove without the  groove? trash cans fill
with words that refer to stacks. " I wish there were more  laws about
almost extinct  animals,"  or  none or always already, the fascinating
pretext all  can adore, and hold as sure fit anecdotes to surface
methodology, when nothing else will phase it the but you say the form
of something is obliged  somewhere to  reason,  flat and predictable.
washed up and taken to the other shore.  parody  the new potentate of
the new century, " I am you being  me through you will on stage seen
only as you, but you know you see you in me being you,  and you can
taste it with a heavy dose of  salt brine inhaled deeply.  there is the
moment when oxygen is depleted, of or by a moment sooner and it would
have been a completely different outcome.  the  teas too hot - the rest
in due course.  one, too, three, four, 6, 6,  5, 6, 6,5 -   there was
an old  . . .  who  . . . rippled the sea.  by famous I mean "
_________" on the dock of . . .  long arm of the . . .  to and or but
when how who whom  then call all come and went  for the potential
infinitive  transgressive polysyllabic ambiguous,  a little bit of the
old slip-in-and-slide, get-a-long,  little affirmations for a new
stick, next caller, new towers,  return tips, money cracks,  kirillian
photo finish, flat as harmony,  fuzz out segue to blue, gold with
nasturtium conclusion.  as to the mental process, it's like an
appendage to potential infinity, murder and revolution.

I thought I was suffering from self-flagellated stereotyping of poet

all:

the new issue of  www.castagraf.com is up...

there you will find another excerpt from the first volume of The Whalebone
Essays,
an on-going collaborative project between myself and the poets Eric Baus,
Nick Moudry & Travis Nichols.

this time it's easier to read
but they use lots of fancy flash
and spell my name wrong
and mean well...

I haven't seen any notice here of Bill Packard's death, so I guess I'll
post the announcement. He died at home in his apartment in NYC Nov. 3,
2002.  Packard was a poet, playwright, novelist, teacher, perhaps best
known as the founder/editor of The New York Quarterly. He started that in
1969, and died just two days after getting out Issue 58. There will be a
public memorial service in New York ( Nov. 23, 7:30)  at the 92nd St. Y,
where he was the host of the famous reading series. His family asks that in
lieu of flowers contributions to be made to NYQ. Issue 59 will be dedicated
to remembrance of Packard and his work.  Sylvester Pollet

Frankly, Joe, I've been amazed at the amount of whining and grousing
folks hereabouts have been doing on this. After all it's *her* party,
and she can dole it out where she wants to. *Some* folks might have
willed it to the US government, stipulating that it be used to beef up
military marching bands, or maybe buy half of a brand-new F-22.

Terrifying? Not even close.

well hal---i can understand the F-22 arguments, of course---but i
suppose it depends on how important you see literary culture, no?...
and right about now, when we're verging e.g. on a war that some (such
as moi) think is a mistake (& please don't mistake this for unbridled
pacifism on my part, either), i would say literary culture is as
important as ever...

and to be candid, this isn't about What The Wealthy Can Do With Their
Money---seems to me that sentiment (and i'm attributing same to you,
yes) can be made to plug squarely into the "free" market rhetoric
that's helping to bring this country down... it's about What The
Wealthy Should Do With Their Money, and in this case, Should Do With
Their Money For The Arts... i hold such folks accountable, even into
their 80s (david rockefeller incl---and have you had a look at his
new memoir?  astonishing, if not terrifying)...

but the last thing i wish to do is come off as precious, in any case,
so i'll withdraw "terrifying", if you insist, and insert, sans
question mark

Seems fair, Joe. If you'll replace "terrifying" with "startling,"
I'll tone down "whining and grousing" to "complaining."

"Under the Sun operates on the small stages of intimate conflict and
longing, but casts light outside the ring: we see the shadows of the crowd,
we smell the dirty water that slaps against the piers. It's a formulation
and un-doing of the personal. Intimacy excavated yields characters, ironic
and adrift, who quiver in the jackets of their names. We know them by
contact, or contract, an occupation of looks and resistance. The poem enact=
s
the force of situated desire. Under the Sun is brilliant wit wrenching
poetics: a word stream taking its shirt off."
=8BCamille Roy=20

"I am struck by the intellectual verve of this poem, its complex sense of
the architecture of the poem as it responds to diverse literary traditions.
This long poem creates rooms of and room for playfulness, humour, political
anger, and aesthetic pleasures. It isn't static; it moves; it reads itself
and interrogates.
=8BCarla Harryman

"Rachel Levitsky brilliantly designs mysterious flying objects of language
and of desire, as she succeeds in giving each word an intriguing span of
life.  Her poems are theater, teaser, solution, entretien de tension which
keep meaning and its boundaries open for intimate manuvres of reading."
=8BNicole Brossard

Rachel Levitsky is the author of four previous chapbooks of poetry,
Cartographies of Error (Leroy Chapbooks), 2[1x1] Portraits (Baksun), Dearly
(A + Bend Press) and The Adventures of Yaya and Grace (Potes and Poets). He=
r
work has appeared in numerous magazines. She lives and works in New York
where she curates the Belladonna reading series and chapbooks series at
Bluestockings Womens Bookstore.

No apology necessary Jeffrey. And I wasn't looking to extract one either, or
to bash the Billy. My cranky post was directed at my enemy, the reader.
Sometimes when someone talking about Ted says "pills" I like to say "dad"....
my own private injection of difficulty... slave to the subjective tho' I be.

Anselm My experience of "discovering" Ted Berigan, your father (I didnt know
he was) .  I  had come "back" to poetry and literature in my forties, and
was doing a degree at Auckland Uni (NZ) and browsing on the shelves of the
American Mod poetry when I came across this strange book edited by someone
called Alice Notely (who I didnt kow then is also one of the major poets of
our times) and its was the book of poems written on lined card i think they
were. I liked the idea but couldnt   "understand" them. (More recently I
tried some poems like that on cards but dont have a publisher or friend like
Alice Notely!) but later I also found (I think it was in a book of NY poets)
the famous sonnets.  Later when Robert Creeley was here (1995) he took some
lectures at Auck Uni and, although some of my friends thought he rambled
(and were grumbling about Olson and others) my reaction was to attend his
lectures and tewy I felt were excellent and inspiring to hear Creeley read
all those poets, most of whom he had known eg Olson himself (it was almost
funny the way Robert turned the Maximus Book around as he read the "circular
poems" but somehow Robert got onto the question of "place"' and gave an
example of somewhere in Wellington (connects as he is married to a New
Zealander I think (another point he is received he by all manner of poetic
phiosophies and grumblers and also seen by the more conservative ... well
the attention paid to him when he visited previously was seen as
intellectual grovelling ( my opinion US culture has an enormous amount to
teach NZrs (as does many other cultures of course (but needed to free
ourselves from too much of the British influence)))) and there were (he
mainly just read from  the various poets and anecdoted about those he knew
such as Ed Dorn, Ted, and John Wieners (I dont know if he knew Jack Spicer
but this was the first time I'd heard of Spicer): I liked the lectures and
didnt mind the "ramble coeficient" (being a great rambler and divigator
myself!) but in one tutorial we got to Ted  Berrigan and we all laughed at
the tape (but the reaction was also almost one of awe and thus I think it is
that people liked the dpwn beat reference to the dog)  of him reading about
one where he comes home and the dog has chewed up his manuscripts or
something: now in that tutorial Michelle Leggott said to the effect how is
that he can do these poems (the O'Hara-ish ..well the Berriganic thing I
suppose) and so many try the method and fail ( my heart sank - would I be
one of those?!) and his reply was that T Berrigan was a voracious reader: he
recalled even seeing him reading and reading on an aeroplane (airplane) trip
(to a poetry reading I suppose) - I cant read on aeroplanes - reading
everywhere and everything:  and the assumption there is that, and it throws
out the image of him just popping pills or drinking pepsi or whtever... it
maybe makes that aspect irrelevant (I pop valium it does me no harm, or not
much, and have been known to drink coca-cola and pepsi since the 1950s!):
here we have a serious artist with a great knowledge and the writer of two
books I refuse to ever sell  "Ted Berrigan Morning Line" and "In the Early
Morning Rain" (which is usually beside anoher book  (beautifully printed on
an old press with also a lot of amjor NZ artists in it (no Wystan its NOT
for sale!!) "Things of Iron Thingsof Green" and expatriaite Aerican poet who
I got a big reading with hundreds of people for but that book is also "off
limits") Bill was a cranky Yank - I billed him as Wid Bill Millet! -  who is
even in a book on The Beats somewhere, but a good guy who got alot  things
going over her in NZ, unfortunately died in 2000 I think it was...his
obsessions were the nuclear issue and war and the injustices to black
people)

But to return: your father was not as  renowned ( but his influence in what
I like to call "significant" poetry  will outlast Billy Collins which is not
to denigrate B Collins...I think it is just a fact of history) as Ginsberg
who I think is an important poet, but is liked "too much"  (as is Baxter
over here).. for maybe the wrong reasons..the legend of him is greater than
his work: and your father didnt kill someone and go crazy on drugs like
Burroughs hence the lack of a big cult following ( I could always sell
Burroughs as  Harry Nudel will confirm or Bukowski but not  (so easily)
Zukofsky or Ted Berrigan (eg)...altho amongst a growing number of young
writers here both of those are becoming very significant (thanks in quite a
large part to Roger Horrocks and Wystan Curnow, Michelle Leggott, and Murray
Edmond and others at Auck Uni)...The Sonnets are just transforming, almost
heart stoppingly elctric, here the "natural voice and the lyric
inter-collide, surely, and also some deconstruction goes on and
construction... I'd cut myself in half (and eat George Bowering's hat) to be
able to write anything like The Sonnets but also the stop start things
(sometimes one thinks of Raworth - of his earlier work).

Grovellor that I am (the only time I've done anything silly like this) I
wanted to shake a "great" poet's hand, so, seeing R Creeley in 1995 one day
on the steps of the Auck Uni library I called out "Robert Creeley! (did I
add "me old mate?)": but thus we shook hands and I mentioned the tutorial on
Berrigan and that poem of Ahsbery's in which he had (used the first line(s)
of "How much..longer..." and also "The doors to the academy of the furure
are opening (Berrigan via Ashbery via Pasternak) ..." and as I said it (at
that time I was obsessed with Ahsbery) I felt a bit guilty as I hadnt read
as many Creeley poems and the thought occurred that mentioning J A might not
be too politic (for all I knew they were /are daedly rivals enemies!!)  but
then the conversation passed to whether I should join the library (it is
very expensive for even a graduate but it has a marvellous range of books)
(but he said he would if it were him ..I wasnt a student then...):

Here's a (some) poem(s) at random:  (they do often rasie a chuckle and
warmth IS a great component of Berrigan's work);

                     CORRIDORS OF BLOOD

                   2   Detective

                  an enormous room with a balcony
                  less virulence
                  our labors were directed toward
                        isolating and creating
                 such a pattern
                 "you must allow your feelings to
                        float free, by
                 themsleves, like dead leaves."
                 "I've got it,"
                 we were furious


[ A thought  .. virulence here has "violence" laid into it maybe (?)]

     6  Cattle of the Sun

               a profusion of melons, oranges, and
                     fish
              all through that night
              a lobster had been following him
              I had an uncomfortable night
              the only place I know
                    where horror borders on poetry


And another sequence:

          PATRIOTISM

         An estimated two million wasps were loosed on an area
         of four hundred and fifty miles inhabited by
         eighty thousand people

or

        AN ORPHAN LEARNS TO COUNT

        The police swooped down in a squad car.


Where whatever else count has at least two meanings.


or     SUNBURN

And these are always not only amusing: sure there is a lightness and and an
O'Haric or Rawothian aspect: but there is much much more: a rich darkness
and a true light of  both a creative and a "lateral thinker", the "New York
influence, the pepsis, the surreal, inspiration, a kind of "golden beauty"
,isxed with the "ordinary" or the daily,simulated or real "madness",
edginess, deliberate disconnections and intrusions: the ancient and the
recent, the references to another's writing(s) that "says it all", the
jumps, the sense of modulant time: all time, in fact,...all time...  and the
feeling and power "in behind" the work  of a person of considerable - surely
very wide and deep -  knowledge of literature and people...one last one ..I

This stuff I'm afraid...I'm not afraid, they approiach the condition of
great music or art: they are so......well I have nothing against the Rita
Doves and Collinses of this poetic firmament, but they are not I feel even
approaching the quality of this stuff. (think even of the title: "Cattle of
the Sun"..extraordinary, extraordinary, beyonds words almost..)....Kind

San Francisco has been temporary home for two great SFMOMA exhibits in the
past year - those of Eve Hesse and Gerhard Richter. Ironically one, the
former, a very young Jewish refugee to America from the German holocaust
and, the latter, the son of a school teacher who fought as a Nazi soldier. I
don't know if anyone has written of that curious coincidence (and what that
association might aesthetically or otherwise reveal of value), but I am
wondering about another association, that of W.G. Siebald fictional works
and that of Richter, which seems close, though I have not read any critical
work with that particular focus (though with a little Googling I could
probably find something.)
But out of a real curiosity - combined with great ignorance - I am wondering
if there is one or more post-war German poets whose work cuts across a
similar historical landscape and tonal (chilling?) grain.  And if the work
is translated, where will I best find it.

Thanks,
Stephen Vincent

     I found our friend Taylor's N.Z. ramblings
fascinating...outside/in....are the poets of empire all that different from
the F22's of Empire....& to be sure
Berrigan/Olson/Bob/Dorn/Duncan/Raworth/Bernstein et al are poets of the
empire...their books travel thru the empire...their voices carry thru the
empire...their poetics influence the empire...whether this is good or
not..i'll leave to Richard's nativists friends...but make no mistake these are
the poets of Abbey & Laurel...& they are as American as multi-culti & 2nd Ave
Yiddish Dadaism..

     For Richard's info...Bob has a N.Z. wife..he, i thinks, sometimes calls
her in his pomes, Pen...now if he had a son called Will....best Harry..

Joe is right. This event is a macabre reminder that money- the money system-
produces mostly terror for most people. A despotic tyrant that wide-awake
winners learn to cringingly cultivate and respect, while the unlucky have
nightmares, lose sleep, and often, little by little, everything else. But a
windfall, such wild dreams!

True. Somewhat though we can take measures  - given a resonable amount of
good fortune and also our own adaptability: we need 1) to see the economic
struggle as a challenge (and along with all other difficulties  it is mainly
a good (thing)  or 2) It is still a challenge but by being mindful we are
struggling as individuals that struggle involves a degree of social support
and hence cooperation   Even the most rapcious capitalist system involves
cooperation and competition at all levels.  I think that when people are
very much in difficulties the economic struggle can seem unbearable: that is
where (in an immediate sense, those of us who are even a little more
fortuanate) can help those not so well off)....I think the donation was well
meant. But that individuals can accumultae such  huge amounts of capital
(represnts labour used) is  not good. Or it points to an ultimate
unworkeability if not a "wrong". However we may have to live with captalism
for many years. I dont know if it is desirable or acheivable for socialism
or something similar ever but the present economic system is not really
working very well. However, we have it now and hence...  the individual
struggle coomtinues  in which life's problems are seen as a challenge, maybe
not solvable, even interesting, but never so burdensome we lose sight of our
goal for happiness (which paradoxically it might seem) involves that of
increasing that of others as we can: we are social animals and also we are
individuals...the two factors cooperation and individual struggle are good
when they harmone...as much as can be expected.   (I'm neglecting things
that are in extremis: some things are almost impossible to surmount: but
then we must recall we need each other - ultimately)....  Richard.

Van Gogh, who couldn't sell a painting in his life, had his paintings sold
for fifty to seventy million dollars, the highest prices ever fetched by any
painting. Do you remember the Japanese company? This is what happens when
someone's life blood is capitalized into an image.

I don't want to put Mrs Harriett in the same category. The first was an
action of showmanship, of power; hers was an act of kindness, a gentle act of
appreciating a gentle act (writing individual rejection letters), even though
there is something quixotic and insane about the act, like leaving all your
money to your two cats.

Steal Something Day
November 24, 2002
Participate by participating!
A shameless 24-hour stealing spree!

For the past nine years, a few self-described "culture jammers" from Adbusters
Magazine have dubbed the last Friday in November "Buy Nothing Day."

 From their stylish home base in Vancouver's upscale suburb of Kitsilano, the
Adbusters' brain trust has encouraged conscientious citizens worldwide to
"relish [their] power as a consumer to change the economic environment." In
their words, Buy Nothing Day "[p]roves how empowering it is to step out of the
consumption
stream for even a day."

The geniuses at Adbusters have managed to create the perfect feel-good,
liberal, middle-class activist non-happening. A day when the more money you
make, the more influence you have (like every other day). A day which, by
definition, is insulting to the millions of people worldwide who are too poor
or marginalized to be considered "consumers."

It's supposed to be a 24-hour moratorium on spending, but ends up being a
moralistic false-debate about whether or not you should really buy that loaf
of bread today or ... wait for it ... tomorrow!

Well, this year, while the Adbusters cult enjoys yet another Buy Nothing Day,
accompanied by their fancy posters, stickers, TV and radio advertisements and
slick webpages, a few self-described anarcho-situationists from Montreal's
East End are inaugurating Steal Something Day.

Unlike Buy Nothing Day, when people are asked to "participate by not
participating," Steal Something Day demands that we "participate by
participating." Instead of downplaying or ignoring the capitalists, CEOs,
landlords, small business tyrants, bosses, PR hacks, yuppies, media lapdogs,
corporate bureaucrats, politicians and cops who are primarily responsible for
misery and exploitation in this world, Steal Something Day demands that we
steal from them, without discrimination.

The Adbusters' intellegentsia tell us that they're neither "left nor right,"
and have proclaimed a non-ideological crusade against overconsumption. Steal
Something Day, on the other hand, identifies with the historic and
contemporary resistance against the causes of capitalist exploitation, not its
symptoms. If you think overconsumption is scary, wait until you hear about
capitalism and imperialism.

Unlike the misplaced Buy Nothing Day notion of consumer empowerment, Steal
Something Day promotes empowerment by urging us to collectively identify the
greedy bastards who are actually responsible for promoting misery and boredom
in this world. Instead of ignoring them, Steal Something Day encourages us to
make their lives as uncomfortable as possible.

As we like to say in Montreal: dranger les riches dans leurs niches!

And remember, we're talking about stealing, not theft. Stealing is just. Theft
is exploitative. Stealing is when you take a yuppie's BMW for a joyride, and
crash into a parked Mercedes just for the hell of it. Theft is when you take
candy from a baby's mouth. Stealing is the re-distribution of wealth from rich
to poor Theft is making profits at the expense of the disadvantaged and the
natural environment. Stealing is an unwritten a tax on the rich. Theft is
taxing the poor to subsidize the rich. Stealing is nothing more than a tax on
the rich. There is solidarity in stealing, but property is nothing but theft.

So, don't pay for that corporate newspaper, but steal all of them from the
box. Get some friends together and go on a "shoplifting" spree at the local
chain supermarket or upscale mall. With an even larger mob, get together and
steal from the local chain book or record store. Pilfer purses and wallets
from easily identified yuppies and business persons. Skip out on rent. Get a
credit card under a fake name and don't pay. Keep what you can use, and give
away everything else in the spirit of mutual aid that is the hallmark of Steal
Something Day.

See you next Steal Something Day which, unlike Buy Nothing Day, happens every
day of the year.

i have mixed feelings about all of this, to the extent that it's
important at all.  i'm uncomfortable with the undisguised envy of
some of the posts; reminds me of grad students on the job market;
when one of them gets a good job, the others, instead of being happy
and understanding that it strengthens their own chances, revile that
person and make up reasons --including imputing disingenuous motives
and actions to that persons advisors, the offering institution, the
candidate him/herself --why it was but shouldn't really have been
that person who got lucky.  it's ugly, victimy and shortsighted.
it's lilly's money, let her at least do something not totally toxic
with it --at least she didn't give it to harvard or to the bush
campaign.  and maybe others will take a lesson and the wealth may get
spread around.  i think we all stand to benefit from poetry's
increased visibility from a number of diff points of view, even if
the terms of that visibility are questionable.  personally i would
have preferred that she sent some of her $$ to malawi, where the
farmers are too weakened from malnutrition to plant for the next
season.  i also think that that's where the enron fall-guys shd be
sent --to do the planting instead of rotting in prison. but that
ain't gonna happen.

I agree, but think there is a difference between - say a local book
store run by  two whatevers, who have local readings by a diverse
culture, sell used books, had a batter program, and a mega store that
sets aesthetic standards only to become the walmat of books, causing
the little stores, the mom and mom or the dad and dad stores to shut
down... and besides stealing a bag of chestnuts for turkey stuffing in
a big supermarket will be covered by their ins. not, some
employee...unless you are talking cost...which is usually passed on to
the consumer. maybe another question would be why support large
institutions: waltart, safewav, mark it, tears and robots, marcys,
thanks giving, xams, universities, large publishing houses, macgronlds,
  why not xerox books,  hand written books, letters, we have the
internet, use it!!...but the funny think is we have this object fetish
(I have an object fetish- I am in a 12 step object fetish reduction
program -not really/really/should be) and place more value on a
impermanent things - a poem stuck on on a telephone pole...this seems
like a much bigger problem then how to steal this or how to build a
personal bomb (I put the last one in for the big ears daddy)

well maria, the question that's most uncomfortable about alla this,
lurking just beneath the surface, but in fact right at the surface of
individual gain:

if someone approached you with $100 million for your poetry mag,
would you just accept same?... or would you try to convince your
donor that perhaps $1 mil would be more appropriate (and greedy in
itself), and that $99 mil would be better spent across the board?...
i don't think this is a matter of envy, not at all, but i can see how
it might become a matter of envy, under the circumstances... What The
Rich Should Do With Their Money For The Arts perhaps has something to
do with Social Responsibility In The Arts... meaning, if ms. lilly
fucked up, so perhaps has mr. parisi---perfect bedfellows...

i'd like to think, nothing pollyanna-ish about it, that i'd do the
right(er) (latter) thing here, but perhaps i wouldn't (since we're
only talking)... i mean, i think there IS a right(er) thing here, for
reasons already gone into... albeit it may not have fallen out, in
practice, so as to allow this right(er) thing to have been done...

still, my experience tells me that there likely wasn't a real attempt
on the part of ~poetry~'s publisher/editor to divert some of those
monies AWAY from ~poetry~ per se (so perhaps a little investigative
reporting is in order?---or are we just tired of talking about
this?)...

i still regard it as a great opportunity instantly (so to speak) lost...

best,

joe

If I were Joseph Parisi, I too would have taken the $100M.  Who really
wouldn't? C'mon...

I think most people would.  But, say Parisi takes the $100M and puts it
into an endowment, he's going to generate about $5M per year. He might want
to use these funds to support the American journals and poets the way all
(much to my surprise) the philanthropic advisors on the Buffalo POETICS
List have suggested. Since Lilly has made this gift, BuffPo has turned into
a Development/Fundraising listserv. What I don't understand is this idea
that Parisi did not know who she was nor that she was wealthy. Two years
ago, I was nominated for the RUTH LILLY PRIZE administered through POETRY.
So, how is it that Parisi did not know who she was until just last week?

James Laughlin used to advise people not to even think of starting a press
without $250,000. If someone were looking at perpetuity as a goal, a $5M
gift would probably be perfect. Throw the money into an endowment that
would generate at 5% interest, $250,000 annually. POETRY can run on that,
can't it? So, could FENCE. So, could McSWEENEY'S. So, could CHAIN. So,
could JUBILAT. So, could MANOA. So, could CONJUNCTIONS. So, could SKANKY
POSSUM, et. etc. etc. Now, if Lilly took $5M, and gave it to 20 American
journals, think about what the profile of American poetry would look like.
But, would the money make American poetry any more relevant?

Sadly, I hesitate to think that answer would still be--no.

A clue as to why American poetry would still be irrelevant lies in all the
whining, resentment, envy, and general grousing we've seen on this list the
past week.

Agency Weighed, but Discarded, Plan Reconfiguring the Internet
By JOHN MARKOFF

NY Times

The Pentagon research agency that is exploring how to create a vast
database of electronic transactions and analyze them for potential
terrorist activity considered but rejected another surveillance idea:
tagging Internet data with unique personal markers to make anonymous use
of some parts of the Internet impossible.

The idea, which was explored at a two-day workshop in California in
August, touched off an angry private dispute among computer scientists
and policy experts who had been brought together to assess the
implications of the technology.

The plan, known as eDNA, called for developing a new version of the
Internet that would include enclaves where it would be impossible to be
anonymous while using the network. The technology would have divided the
Internet into secure "public network highways," where a computer user
would have needed to be identified, and "private network alleyways,"
which would not have required identification.

Several people familiar with the eDNA discussions said such secure areas
might have first involved government employees or law enforcement
agencies, then been extended to security-conscious organizations like
financial institutions, and after that been broadened even further.

A description of the eDNA proposal that was sent to the 18 workshop
participants read in part: "We envisage that all network and client
resources will maintain traces of user eDNA so that the user can be
uniquely identified as having visited a Web site, having started a
process or having sent a packet. This way, the resources and those who
use them form a virtual `crime scene' that contains evidence about the
identity of the users, much the same way as a real crime scene contains
DNA traces of people."

The proposal would have been one of a series of technology initiatives
that have been pursued by the Bush administration for what it describes
as part of the effort to counter the potential for further terrorist
attacks in the Unites States. Those initiatives include a variety of
plans to trace and monitor the electronic activities of United States
citizens.

In recent weeks another undertaking of the Defense Advanced Research
Projects Agency, or Darpa, the Pentagon research organization, has drawn
sharp criticism for its potential to undermine civil liberties. That
project is being headed by John M. Poindexter, the retired vice admiral
who served as national security adviser to President Ronald Reagan.

Dr. Poindexter returned to the Pentagon in January to direct the
research agency's Information Awareness Office, created in the wake of
the Sept. 11 attacks. That office has been pursuing a surveillance
system called Total Information Awareness that would permit intelligence
analysts and law enforcement officials to mount a vast dragnet through
electronic transaction data ranging from credit card information to
veterinary records, in the United States and internationally, to hunt
for terrorists.

In contrast, with eDNA the user would have needed to enter a digital
version of unique personal identifiers, like a fingerprint or voice, in
order to use the secure enclaves of the network. That would have been
turned into an electronic signature that could have been appended to
every Internet message or activity and thus tracked back to its source.

The eDNA idea was originally envisioned in a private brainstorming
session that included the director of Darpa, Dr. Tony Tether, and a
number of computer researchers, according to a person with intimate
knowledge of the proposal. At the meeting, this person said, Dr. Tether
asked why Internet attacks could not be traced back to their point of
origin, and was told that given the current structure of the Internet,
doing so was frequently not possible.

The review of the proposal was financed by a second Darpa unit, the
Information Processing Technology Office. This week a Darpa spokeswoman,
Jan Walker, said the agency planned no further financing for the idea.
In explaining the reason for the decision to finance the review in the
first place, Ms. Walker said the agency had been "intrigued by the
difficult computing science research involved in creating network
capabilities that would provide the same levels of responsibility and
accountability in cyberspace as now exist in the physical world."

Darpa awarded a $60,000 contract to SRI International, a research
concern based in Menlo Park, Calif., to investigate the concept. SRI
then convened the workshop in August to evaluate its feasibility.

The workshop brought together a group of respected computer security
researchers, including Whitfield Diffie of Sun Microsystems and Matt
Blaze of AT&T Labs; well-known computer scientists like Roger Needham of
Microsoft Research in Cambridge, England; Michael Vatis, who headed the
National Infrastructure Protection Center during the Clinton
administration; and Marc Rotenberg, a privacy expert from the Electronic
Privacy Information Center.

The workshop was led by Mr. Blaze and Dr. Victoria Stavridou, an SRI
computer scientist, one of those who had originally discussed the eDNA
concept with Darpa officials.

At the workshop, the idea was criticized by almost all the participants,
a number of them said, on both technical and privacy grounds. Several
computer experts said they believed that it would not solve the problems
it would be addressing.

"Before people demand more surveillance information, they should be able
to process the information they already have," Mark Seiden, an
independent computer security expert who attended the workshop, said in
an interview. "Almost all of our failures to date have come from our
inability to use existing intelligence information."

Several of the researchers told of a heated e-mail exchange in September
over how to represent the consensus of the workshop in a report that was
to be submitted to Darpa. At one point, Mr. Blaze reported to the group
that he had been "fired" by Dr. Stavridou, of SRI, from his appointed
role of writing the report presenting that consensus.

In e-mail messages, several participants said they believed that Dr.
Stavridou was hijacking the report and that the group's consensus would
not be reported to Darpa.

"I've never seen such personal attacks," one participant said in a
subsequent telephone interview.

In defending herself by e-mail, Dr. Stavridou told the other panelists,
"Darpa asked SRI to organize the meeting because they have a deep
interest in technology for identifying network miscreants and revoking
their network privileges."

In October, Dr. Stavridou traveled to Darpa headquarters in Virginia and
- after a teleconference from there that was to have included Mr. Blaze,
Mr. Rotenberg and Mr. Vatis was canceled - later told the panelists by
e-mail that she had briefed several Darpa officials on her own about the
group's discussions.

In that e-mail message, sent to the group on Oct. 15, she reported that
the Darpa officials had been impressed with the panel's work and had
told her that three Darpa offices, including the Information Awareness
Office, were interested in pursuing the technology.

This week, however, in response to a reporter's question, Darpa said it
had no plans to pursue the technology. And an SRI spokeswoman, Alice
Resnick, said yesterday, "SRI informed Darpa that the costs and risks
would outweigh any benefit."

Dr. Stavridou did not return phone calls asking for comment.

I agree with just about all of what Joe says, but I also don't think it
was ever an "opportunity." I doubt that there was any chance Ms. Lilly
was ever going to broadcast her fortune widely among worthy
poetry-organization recipients; I doubt that she would ever have
considered asking Poetry Magazine to do so, across aesthetic, political,
and other lines within the poetry world. I think hers is just an
eccentric bequest, and I can wish it had happened in a different way,
but I can't imagine that was ever a possibility.

As for Joe's repetition of "What The Rich Should Do With Their Money For
The Arts," while I might have ideas about that, I don't think my ideas
have a shot in prozac's hell of being adopted (I don't think Joe's ideas
have that shot, either). Also, I am reluctant to wish for an age for the
arts that is specifically identified with that kind of upper class
patronage (despite that I'd love to see many more artists and arts
organizations become instantly better funded, even spared of spending so
much effort simply trying to maintain financial existence for a few
years or more), while admitting that we may have had, for a long time,
some version of such a patronage system.

I suppose one of the aims of the NEA/state arts commissions/local arts
councils has been to equalize the funding field to some degree, mixing a
kind of democratic and geographic and demographic distribution of funds
with some consideration of merit-based funding. While I think this
system has failed in many ways, I don't know that it's worse than what
we get with endowment-by-the-rich scenarios. I mean, we have, to some
degree, both such systems functioning simulatenously now (although this
may differ from one micro-region to another), without much sense or
sensitivity to the arts (with notable exceptions, of course, and
oftentimes with the best of intentions on the part of funders). Rather
than worry about the Lilly bequest, I wonder if there are ideas among
listmembers here about what would constitute not only a desirable state
of arts/poetry funding, but also a realizable (or something close) state
of such funding. I also know that such arguments may only make sense on
local levels, although one wonders, in this age of virtual communities,
whether locality in this sense has the same importance it had even a
decade ago.

other possible donor-targets be brought into the mix? (much as you've

Joe,

I too struggle daily, and my struggles lies with attempting to bridge the
wide gap between my vocation and occupation. The struggle wears me down day
after day, especially nowadays.

Maybe my take on this has more to do with my line of work. I've been
working in a development office for more than six years, and in the office
in which I work, we basically deal with the top 1 percent of the wealthiest
Americans. It has jaded me. However, I see how people spin things
there.  More is more in the charitable world.

I don't think ethics come into play here at all, Joe. If -- as the story
has been reported -- he received the bequest at his surprise, I don't think
he had a choice to negotiate the giving. If it is in the will, no one can
change her wishes now

What gets me a bit is when I read the NYT article and it said:

"We get to see everything, and we get a pretty good idea of who will be the
new important poets," Mr. Parisi said.

I don't think that Parisi has the faintest idea what a 'new important poet'
is judging from his editing.

I think we just need to pass over this and continue to do the work that we
have laid out for ourselves. Maybe, just maybe, Poetry will find some of us
new and important???

Oh, what an utterly fabulous idea. Why not just call it National Day of
Creating Shitty Karma? Like USAmericans don't do that frequently enough?

I loved Abbie Hoffman too, but he's dead, whether the CIA or bipolar
disorder got him. I'm going to steal a kiss from my husband and be even
more subversive: by doing an act of nominal theft which is all the more
radical for the fact that the alleged victim feels given to.

Now, levitating the Pentagon, that I'd do.

Needless to say, Darpa's rejection does not mean the idea and research has
not been handed on to another agency for execution. That seems to be the way
this Administration works, if he FBI or Pentagon refuses, for example,
Rumsfeld's agenda, it's handed off to another agency, or, failing that, a
new agency is created. Eventally, one suspects, the fear of protecting our
communications with one another (political, religious, financial, etc.) will
have us "talking in tongues". David Melnick - whose work I really like -
will be re-interpreted as a prophet before which Ashcroft and Company will
be blind, illiterate and deaf, as well as dumb. Yes, it will be a small
world for a while in which communicative survival and protection will be a
hard earned craft of ear and eye. As with WWII Navaho code talkers, one's
going to have to go with what works.
How is that for democracy gone totally paranoid!

just wanted to say that it's been very interesting reading all these feelings and thoughts on Ms. Lily's enormous gift to "Poetry"

frankly i want to encourage it!  bitching about the use or misuse of money is marvelous!  it's healthy!  living in an age where prisons are FILLED, and new prisons are being built to also be FILLED and placed on the stock market alongside TWA, Spalding, AT&T and all those other BASTARDS who layoff workers and make prisoners do the work for 25 cents an hour, poets NEED to be pissed off and as loud as possible to be working our way out of the confusion of money!

i agree with Maria Damon that at least the money didn't go to Bush or Harvard.  although a little more empathy is needed for those complaining.  if it weren't for the fucking rich in the first place we wouldn't be so consumed with RAGE about having our needs met!

but where did all Ms. Lily's money come from?  it's too much to not STINK of profiting off poverty.  but then again, maybe this was understood by the donor, who wanted to refine the wealth through poetry?  let's see what happens.  it may be the very thing that surprises the world.  somehow.

Surprising - that at this post and the examples of Berrigan's work, I
started making connections to (not the style - but the way the mind seems to
work) ARD Fairburn - (an NZ poet - No longer with us) who I have been
re-reading recently with regards to a History thing I have been working on.
Tho Fairburn died 57 when B. would have been but a whippersnapper. Both had
minds seemed to be able to lurch - not shift - left. May be nothing in it.

this is all to motionless for rubber words

this transit service, this kinesthetic theme park, the best routes with
deep throated spikes, starved in luxury fat chairs, beguiled in all
that forms the air to a danger larger than a bunraku master with a head
of smoke, a drift, to become an fetish interpretation. this is the way
that heralds more rigor-mortis warm time in high color regular shapes.
a dangerous love of science. words lifted for magical seduction,
exposed like the inside of my rubber climate control devotion, or
detailed marginal rotations, or lines that meander wildly over general
wounded dumbfoundedness. this was suppose to be the last stock joke, a
remote staccato upside on the inside, a motionless terrorist in my
private vaseline insomnia, buying groceries through the angels of a
chemical process, located outside error crayons. a holiday character,
not my history, or my hisotry not the holiday character ignites
determinist parallel text inside the only "I" I can muster, unable to
resist the blows lifted from a provocateur at local tables and gauzy
alcohol extremities, where all crave warm time machines and magical
seduction.

all cry of souls. I still look for a vacuum and 7000 oak trees in their
pure reason.

i'm SO TIRED of the weapon of Karma!

the rich would have met their demise centuries ago!

you try going to India and telling a member of the Untouchable Caste

what we need is something BRAND NEW!  totally NEW!
the comfortable references of Karma, Sin, and the rest have served no one,

and by the way, yeah, we know Abbie Hoffman is dead.
so no one can steal anymore?  but we could when he was alive?
what in the hell are you saying there?

It ain't no weapon, nor cleaver. It is simple causality. You leave a
banana peel on the sidewalk, someone's gonna slip on it.

Nope, because that would be a major, hideous misinterpretation of the
whole idea.

OK, Ezra. Calm down.

Is it OK by you for me to be a Buddhist if I can produce evidence I'm poor?

Theft is exactly what the corporate interests are DOING on a daily
basis. Usura and all that, I'm sure you know. Stooping to their level is
a tactical blunder. You've never heard the saying "The master's tools
will never dismantle the master's house"?

Glad you're alive. No, I'm not going to diss yo' mama. I like my raw
fish in rice rolls, not bait. I can't fault a mother for ensuring the
survival of her offspring. But however justified, the fact remains that
it was ultimately at someone else's expense. That's not a blanket
condemnation, that's just how it is -- and it makes your world a
zero-sum game, exactly as the Bushites behave. This is supposed to be a
good thing? She told you something like, "Son, I hope you continue
taking this particular risk when you're grown up"?

My father knew Fairburn and R A K Mason (who wrote most of his poetry before
he wwas about 23 I think) ...he had the capacity to be a major poet but he
was more a personality: I havent looked at his stuff for years. by and large
NZ dint/hasnt had poets of Berrigan's calibre...or they (like  Fairburn)
were following some sort of British romantic tradition (mind you,see below,
it a long time since I've read  A R D)...but Fairburn was certainly a hard
case I have two book on his life for sale on abe  (Aspect Books): he would
get into fights, piss in  the street in London,  open the door naked, swim
for miles across the Waitemata, was a "woman-basher", interested in
compost!, he was a greta womaniser but when he went to London he liekd the
fact taht nearly everyone were gay or worse variations on that!!, and so
on..so he had the potential to become a Berrigan but like a lot of NZrs of
that time was too much under the British trad spell I think: that said he
wrote some beautiful/interesting  poetry and some political poetry.

As I write this email I  have started to look at Fairburn again...you've
diverted me again: will report back any Berriganic aspects I detect....I
think you picked up on the nature of the guy who was liekeable and very
human despite his pecadillos etc and slo his style does have a humorous and
wry style.....hmmmmm..... there may be something in what you are
intimating....turns pagew off "Collcted Pomes"...hmmm...the book THE
RAKEHELLY MAN is worth a look. My book of Fairburn's I got when I was
twenty. That was 1968...  Cheers.

Richard Taylor.

or wait, you could always, instead, imagine that you are a doorstop and with
all the rights of a doorstop preclude the variance of the door, and in doing
so fulfill your nature while at the same time not messing with the door's
nature. on the other hand, you could invent something that is green and
lovely, but not exactly money. or you could open a door into the future of
money and tell everyone not to go there. or you could try to invent a place
where money isn't even a noun it's more like a palliative or tenured
exactitude to talk about. you could say that what you have whipped up in the
argument is the lovely life of everything necessary, and tellingly smoke the
residue until you are money itself, as in the brother or sister that you
always knew you wanted. or you could accept a time/space requiem, laying
down appropriate odds and certitude while dedicating yourself to the higher
aim, quote unquote, or tapping on a keyboard such as is indicative of higher
planning within the framework of what is up in a sedentary fashion, lifting
money from trees as an engagement in a rationale that has been spotted over
the eons as a trippy slugfest yet well worth the effort. or you could simply
make the colour go away, for the poem that was to follow simply got stuck.

i don't know how effective 'steal something day' would be. it seems to me
when you make it a case of 'us against them', you've already lost. i don't
think the universe differentiates between stealing from a large corporation
or a elderly persons social security. i would in fact say that i don't wish
to become someone i can't face in the mirror.
have we become so powerless and cynical that we don't believe in the power
of our moral values or the power of our written words ? have we become so
lazy that we can't be bothered to look for the solution in our ability to
use the written word ?
try writing to your governmental repesentives starting at the local level
and work your way up. try writing to the media and telling them you aren't
buying into the pixie dust theory of news reporting and demand that they use
the 'free press' to report what is really happening rather than the skewed
version we've been spoon fed.
refuse to wrap yourself in the american flag and go back to sleep.
and never never never bargain away your ethics for anything. no matter what
anyone tells you, it *does* matter how you get there.
peace, beth

still bepuzzling over asocial in relation to poetry in common and
semi-clinical parlance
common definition: "rejecting or lacking the capacity for social
interaction" more clinical: "withdrawn from society; indifferent to social
rules or customs; e.g., a
recluse, a regressed schizophrenic person, a schizoid personality."

both seem impossibilities in one sense as poetry that is too obtuse to be
seen as communication is be definition a communication as in a hermit or
recluse in Waldon making a relational statement.

I recall reading adventure and other novels and poetry in high school
classes out of boredom and as a statement, for example.

If one were to change this to 'asociety' it might resolve this paradox but
I'm not sure what to make of asocietal lyricism although as analogous to
music that can be melodious while the world goes to hell in a handbasket
around it syntactically has some plausibility.

perhaps antisocietal?  but then I'm not sure if antidisestablishmentarianism
has a place in a poetics piece?

While it would be great for so much money to go to poetry, it is unfortunate
that that much money is going to Poetry. This magazine operates under a very
narrow definition of their name. Poetry magazine prints poetry that business
can claim the way they do their art collections.
And probably it's insignificant, since what does poetry mean to most folks
in America, even the Rich & Powerful.  But this gift seems, though probably
not intended, in line with the current Administration's commodification of
life. Governement should not fund art--business should. The profit margin
may be the cruelset taskmaster for artists.
Bottom line--Poetry magazine would not publish most of us to begin with and
probably still won't include us in however they spend their new- foudn
windfall. maybe more businesses will see literature as a traget for
generoisty. Otherwise we go on flinging our language, hoping to raise a
spark that will wake up a few thousand people and provide them another
vision.

okay, here's a question:

what are folks experiences regarding book publication?
outside of contests, did you know someone?
send the work out? get asked for it? start the press yourself?
and if you run a press does it bother you when folks send work unsolicited?
just curious about everyone's experiences...
I've sent out one manuscript over 35 times now and still no luck, but
recently had a second manuscript taken by the first place I sent it to, so
I'd just like to hear from others...
how many times have you had to send work out?

thanks,

noah

Hi everyone, hope that if you're free next Sunday, and if you're in
the Bay Area, you can make it to this event on World AIDS Day.  --
Kevin K.
There'll be lots of surprises.

World AIDS Day Reading: Commemorating Steve Abbott
Sunday, December 1 @ 2 pm
In commemoration of World AIDS Day, the James C. Hormel Center of the
San Francisco Public Library will host a reading to honor the 10th
anniversary of the death of Steve Abbott (www.steveabbott.org),
influential San Francisco poet, critic and writer who died of AIDS in
1992.  His daughter, Alysia Abbott, will be joined by writers Dodie
Bellamy, Kevin Killian, Bob Gluck and others in remembering Steve
Abbott's life and work.

Steve Abbott was a widely respected and prominent member of San
Francisco's literary and gay community for nearly two decades. After
moving to the City in 1973, he taught writing at University of San
Francisco, served as managing editor of Poetry Flash, wrote a weekly
column for the San Francisco Sentinel, and contributed to the SF
Weekly and the Advocate. Abbott published five volumes of poetry,
three novels and a collection of essays before dying of AIDS-related
complications on December 2, 1992.

The reading will be hosted by the San Francisco Public Library's
James C. Hormel Gay and Lesbian Center, which houses Steve Abbott's
papers. The Hormel Center is devoted to the documentation of lesbian
and gay history and culture by collecting, preserving and providing
access to material on all aspects of the lesbian, gay, bisexual and
transgender experience.

My only published book came about because a friend wanted to publish my
poetry. I sent stuff to the Auck Uni  Press but apart from that I intend to
self-publish from now or maybe: but I anticipate that if I do publish it
wiill be thru contacts or people I know.  I want people to want what I am
doing or to do. The other thing is that I would have to be very confident
that what I had done was worth publishing and someone was interested: if I
feel luke warm toward my own work at times, or I dont think what I have done
is any good.....I may be wrong or right but the point is a lot of people
seem obssessed with "being published"as if its going to solve their life's
problems: I was reading about and reading Emily Dickinson's
poems...according to my old Encylopedia Britannica she eventually refused
publication (or eschewed it) especially after the reaction of was it
Higginson who was baffled by her work: now in a way it seems tragic she
didnt get "recognition" but it might have been more tragic for the integrity
of her art  and herself if she had been published at the wrong time.  A
strange paradox and I know there are huge holes in what I am saying
here...but I like the idea of poets who were never recongised as such: I
like the idea of Emily writing her poetry: the immensity of that, the
loneliness, the joy,  the pure courage...Shakespear wasnt much (not as he is
today) known in his own time as apoet ro even (unles to ben Jonson and few
otehrs) as  aprticularly even significant playwrite let alone poet Idont
think.... I think that the greatest are frequently (and there will always be
a big percentage of these people) not known in their life time ..in another
sphere, music ...Bach was not known except as a competent organist and
probably a "considerable" musician...some writers artists etc are better not
known in their life time...but of course the reverse doesnt apply: if one
can be published and feted somewhat and retain one's integrity that is also
good.....

I think a lot of writers though are obssessed with "being published" ...they
are not sufficiently self-critical of their own work: if one's work is
simply "no good" (albeit as the E Dickinson case exemplifies somewhat that
judgement of "no good" is problematic and contradictory I know: as indeed we
feel that those around her (most) didnt think she was "writing
poetry"....but nevertheless, I repeat, I'm a bit dunious of these people
desperate to be published.  Why publish is the question - who wants to see
this stuff I'm writing?  Does anyone care?  There are so many poetry books.

Maybe I'm feelin' a bit blue.....its just my "take" for the nonce: forget
about it.

i think what's meant by asocial is the dissociated nature of much
mainstream poetry --its solipsism, self-involvement, etc, as if there
were no one in the world but this one poet examining his/her one
personal sensibility.  disingenuous of course, because always, the
evaluative, "craft-conscious" public is looking over the shoulder of
this solitary struggler, so the solitary struggle is a performance
for an audience.  but also, in a deeper and more interesting sense,
the poem can function, as adorno argues in "lyric poetry and
society," precisely in its asociality, as a restorative or a
complement to the overwhelming nature of industrialized social life.

New from Wesleyan University Press:

Treadwinds: Poems and Intermedia Texts
The first full volume of Walter K. Lew's poems and intermedia pieces.

Since the early 1970s, the poet and scholar Walter K. Lew has
produced innovative works ranging from linked-verse elegies for jazz
musicians and multimedia "movietelling" performances to pioneering
poetry anthologies and TV documentaries. Treadwinds collects much of
Lew's poetry for the first time and arranges it into five thematic
sections.

Some poems include Korean and Japanese texts, while the title poem
accompanies six collages by filmmaker Lewis Klahr. Evident throughout
is Lew's devotion to obscured aesthetic traditions, political
critique, historical redemption, and the creation of new meaning
across media and between zones of culture.

"Walter Lew has the sure touch, whether in love lyric,
transliteration, or multimedia collage-work; in homophonous or
cross-cultural translation; in historical insight or sound/image
nexus. His previous work as an anthologist (Premonitions) and
responsive/responsible critic (Excerpts from: =90IKTH DIKTE, for DICTEE
(1982)) has brought these genres into new realms; the
much-anticipated Treadwinds likewise opens new paths into a 'global
poetry' by integrating visual, semantic, and sound poetry to
articulate a simultaneously resonant and dissonant intercultural
aesthetic."
--Maria Damon, author of The Dark End of the Street: Margins in
American Vanguard Poetry

"This collection, culled from 20 years of writing, puts forth a
unique mixture of traditional, even ancient, poetic styles that
extends across cultures.... This eclecticism is all held together by
Lew's measured pace, lively sense of enjambment, condensed imagery
and impatience with the facile wordplay that sinks other poetry
covering similar themes. It fills in an important corner not only of
Lew's multifaceted career but the larger portrait of Korean and
Asian-American literature of the past two decades."
--Publishers Weekly

"Editor and collagist, movieteller and translator, Lew is one of our
most precious cultural resources. These wondrous fragments...are his
multifaceted talents at their most finely honed."
--Alvin Lu, author of The Hell Screens

"Whether the tongue is yanked out of the mouth by a crow, tasting a
lover's taste, speaking one language or another, or story-telling
with great pleasure, Lew presents us with poems that ripple with
startling images and sounds and, ah!--with heart."
--Kimiko Hahn, author of Mosquito and Ant

does anyone have any information about the poet Amus Moore?

check this out, from "Black Spirits" -- from an old Motown associated
recording:

http://www.factoryschool.org/content/sounds/poetry/moore_amus/moore_amus_hip.ram

Was he ever anthologized? Published in what magazines?

I don't own this recording (is it on cd?) so I'm not sure if it says
anything about him on the sleeve, or what...

From the outside this looks like
an explosion. While touching just
the right spot, site and event
confuse, fuzzing all over with verse
and stream. One way is outside

on an overhang of porch, smoking
the old ladies flimsy into shelters
scanning the sacrosanct for virus.
From the inside as you can see

everything is quite quiet, quilted
over with origins girt 'round

and solipsistic. No-one's gettin'
in here but you! I verify the password
'privilege,' staking crosswise
old arts into daylight frozen in chunks

of lovely mezzanine breeding. From

this angle, gangrene sips into quivering gowns
that grow like devastation grows, shooting

because you have weapons, you are a danger, you
draw around you the roundness of this place
and wrap it up tightly around
my throat. I take a deeper breath than previous
generations. I rotate stock.

From this form's venturing you succumb to plunging
fussiness,
Ms. Vaverchak says. She's the only real lovely vote
for me.
Glasses sag and rant their narcissistic business.
Glass

between her and he is useless celibacy. I state
because
the event and the place of birth gets tangled up in
these spokes I sip from quiet robes, slippers on,

smoking only my age, and stretched to null.

Modernist Cultures

Modernist Studies Association Fifth Annual Conference
Birmingham, UK
25th – 28th September 2003

Founded in 1999, the Modernist Studies Association is devoted to the study
of the arts in their social, political, cultural, and intellectual contexts
from the late nineteenth through the mid-twentieth century. Through its
annual conferences and journal, Modernism/Modernity, the organization seeks
to develop an international and interdisciplinary forum for exchange among
scholars in this revitalized and rapidly expanding field.

The fifth annual Modernist Studies Association Conference is the first to
be held in Europe. Hosted by the University of Birmingham and the
University of Sussex, it will take place in the heart of the multicultural
city of Birmingham, a world-renowned conference centre and the UK's second
city, where Victorian architecture mingles with exciting and innovative
redevelopment. The programme will include plenaries, panels, peer seminars,
prose and poetry readings, along with film screenings and book and art
exhibits specifically related to the international and interdisciplinary
study of modernist cultures.

Conference Coordinators:
Andrzej Gasiorek and Deborah Parsons (University of Birmingham)
Laura Marcus and Peter Nicholls (University of Sussex)

Conference Administrator: Samantha Skinner, Department of English,
University of Birmingham, Edgbaston, Birmingham B15 2TT, UK.

Calls for seminar, panel, and individual paper proposals follow.  Please
note that the deadline for peer seminar proposals is 31 January 2003, the
deadline for panel and individual paper proposals 4 April 2003. Please note
also that MSA rules do not allow participants to lead a seminar and present
a paper for a panel at the same conference, though participants may present
a panel paper and participate in a seminar, or chair a panel and lead a
seminar.

All who attend the MSA Conference must be members of the organization with
dues paid for 2003.


Call for Peer Seminar Leaders
Deadline: 31 January 2003
What is a Peer Seminar?
One of the most significant features of the MSA meetings is the
participation of conferees in peer seminars.  Seminars are small-group
discussion sessions (of no more than 15 people) for which participants
write brief "position papers" that are read and circulated prior to the
conference.  Seminars generate lively and valuable exchange during the
conference and in some cases have created a network of scholars who have
continued to work together.  Further, the peer seminar model allows most
conferees to seek financial support from their institutions as they educate
themselves and their colleagues on subjects of mutual interest.
There are no restrictions on seminar topics.  Past experience has shown
that the more clearly defined the topic and the more guidance provided by
the leader, the more useful the discussion has been to participants'
individual projects.  Seminar topics at the 2002 MSA conference included
"Low Modernism," "Modernism and Mourning," "Class Matters," and "World
Modernisms."  For a full listing, see the MSA Web site.
How do I propose a Peer Seminar?
Seminar proposals must include the following information.  Please assist us
by sending this information in exactly the order given here.  Use as a
subject line for your e-mail: MSA 5 SEMINAR PROPOSAL / [LAST NAME OF
SEMINAR LEADER].

* The seminar leader's name, institutional affiliation, discipline or
department, mailing address, phone, fax, and e-mail address
* A brief description (up to 100 words) of the proposed topic
* A current curriculum vitae for the seminar leader

Send peer seminar proposals to Samantha Skinner, sjskinner@yahoo.com by
Friday 31st January, 2003.  Early submission is strongly encouraged.

Seminars will be selected in early March.


What is involved in leading a Peer Seminar?

The MSA will advertise seminars and register participants.  To promote
discussion, the size of seminars is limited to 15.  Leaders may, at their
option, invite one or two individuals to join the seminar in some special
role.  Some leaders will wish to share the work of reading and responding
to papers with the invited participants; others will simply want to assure
a high standard of discussion by involving scholars whose work they know to
be important for their topic.  Please note that invited participants will
not be specially listed as such in the conference program.

E-mail addresses for all seminar registrants will be provided to seminar
leaders in May. At that time, leaders should:

* Initiate communications by e-mail, introducing themselves and providing
addresses to all participants.
* Set guidelines for the seminar. These might include questions to be
addressed, reading to be done, and a specified length for the position
papers (normally 5-7 pages).
* Set firm deadlines, no later than early August for the actual exchange of
papers.
* Exchange and read papers during the 6-8 weeks before the conference.
* Plan the seminar format. The MSA will provide guidance, but leaders are,
within reasonable limits, free to use the time (two hours) as they see fit.


CALL FOR PANEL PROPOSALS
Deadline: 4 April 2003

How do I propose a Panel?

Proposals for panels must include the following information.  Please assist
us by sending this information in exactly the order given here.  Use as a
subject line for your e-mail: MSA 5 PANEL PROPOSAL / [LAST NAME OF PANEL
ORGANIZER].

* Session title
* Session Organizer's name, institutional affiliation, discipline or
department, mailing address, phone, fax, and e-mail address
* Chair's name, institutional affiliation, discipline or department, and
contact information (If you cannot identify a chair, we will locate one for
you.)
*Panelists' names, paper titles, institutional affiliations, disciplines or
departments, and contact information
*  A 500-word abstract describing the panel as a whole and the content of
individual papers

MSA policy on panels:

1. No participant may present more than one paper at one conference, and no
participant may both present a paper and lead one of the conference's seminars.
2. We encourage interdisciplinary panels, and strongly discourage panels on
single authors.
3. We encourage panels with three participants.  Panels of four and
roundtables of five or six will be considered.
4.  Panels composed entirely of participants from a single department at a
single institution are not likely to be accepted.
5. All MSA panels must have a chair who is not giving a paper.  Please
attempt to locate a moderator, but if you do not have one, we will locate
one for you.

Send panel proposals to Samantha Skinner, sjskinner@yahoo.com by Friday 4th
April, 2003.  Early submission is strongly encouraged.

Individual Paper Proposals

In addition to pre-arranged panels, a limited number of individual papers
may be accepted for the program of MSA 5.  Please send your name, paper
title, institutional affiliation, discipline or department, and contact

Richard,

as per my own feeling...it's not an obsession, rather an interest in
entering into a conversation, a community, into what's going on now. Sure,
the myth of the lone writer tinkering away w/o recognition is there, but
funny, it always seems a myth...it's not about getting anywhere on the scale
of say Collins. It's about responding to the work that's out there and
having one's work responded to. The idea of being recognized after one's
time still carries the urge to be "recognized"...I'm interested in poetry
that's being written now (and of course older work) in the work of my
friends, peers, those whose work I admire. Yes, there's a tremendous muck of
various people's output in the world, but some of that muck resonates. I
love when I discover a poem in a journal which sets me to writing...that's
the point to carry it all on...

noah

My only published book came about because a friend wanted to publish my
poetry. I sent stuff to the Auck Uni  Press but apart from that I intend to
self-publish from now or maybe: but I anticipate that if I do publish it
wiill be thru contacts or people I know.  I want people to want what I am
doing or to do. The other thing is that I would have to be very confident
that what I had done was worth publishing and someone was interested: if I
feel luke warm toward my own work at times, or I dont think what I have done
is any good.....I may be wrong or right but the point is a lot of people
seem obssessed with "being published"as if its going to solve their life's
problems: I was reading about and reading Emily Dickinson's
poems...according to my old Encylopedia Britannica she eventually refused
publication (or eschewed it) especially after the reaction of was it
Higginson who was baffled by her work: now in a way it seems tragic she
didnt get "recognition" but it might have been more tragic for the integrity
of her art  and herself if she had been published at the wrong time.  A
strange paradox and I know there are huge holes in what I am saying
here...but I like the idea of poets who were never recongised as such: I
like the idea of Emily writing her poetry: the immensity of that, the
loneliness, the joy,  the pure courage...Shakespear wasnt much (not as he is
today) known in his own time as apoet ro even (unles to ben Jonson and few
otehrs) as  aprticularly even significant playwrite let alone poet Idont
think.... I think that the greatest are frequently (and there will always be
a big percentage of these people) not known in their life time ..in another
sphere, music ...Bach was not known except as a competent organist and
probably a "considerable" musician...some writers artists etc are better not
known in their life time...but of course the reverse doesnt apply: if one
can be published and feted somewhat and retain one's integrity that is also
good.....

I think a lot of writers though are obssessed with "being published" ...they
are not sufficiently self-critical of their own work: if one's work is
simply "no good" (albeit as the E Dickinson case exemplifies somewhat that
judgement of "no good" is problematic and contradictory I know: as indeed we
feel that those around her (most) didnt think she was "writing
poetry"....but nevertheless, I repeat, I'm a bit dunious of these people
desperate to be published.  Why publish is the question - who wants to see
this stuff I'm writing?  Does anyone care?  There are so many poetry books.

Maybe I'm feelin' a bit blue.....its just my "take" for the nonce: forget
about it.

hey, my FAVORITE arguments have always been with Buddhists.  probably because
they're/you're closest to a meaningful understanding of healing separation.
there's NO WAY to argue with my simple-minded born again Christian relatives,
but Buddhists, now there's a group you can have a healthy climb to beauty
with in the boxing ring.

i still say Karma is a bullshit weapon whipping the backs of the poor to
prevent us from chopping down the door to the Big House.

i feel very strongly that one day everyone will awaken from the long
controlling dream of Jesus, Buddha, Krishna, and the rest.  and.  who.

Singing Horse Press announces the publication of "a doctrine of signatures,"
by Jenn McCreary, and "The Effacements," by Chris McCreary, as a unique
double-book.

Drawing on medieval medicinal tracts, Jenn McCreary's "a doctrine of
signatures" finds the lyric implicit in the natural world, our life within
it, and our manipulation of it. The subject of Chris McCreary's "The
Effacements" is literature itself, including his long sequence "Twenty-One
Suggested Readings," which distills classical and modern texts.

"a doctrine of signatures" / "The Effacements" has been designed as one book
with two covers and one binding. It is the fourth book in Singing Horse
Press's ongoing Philadelphia Publishing Project, which seeks to develop a
national audience for the work of authors living in southeastern
Pennsylvania. Previous titles include "Drunkard Boxing," by Linh Dinh,
"Practicing Amnesia," by Heather Thomas, and "Without a Trace," by Eli
Goldblatt. Subscriptions to the series bring three titles and cost $25.

"a doctrine of signatures," by Jenn McCreary, and "The Effacements," by Chris
McCreary. 112 pages, perfectbound, $12.50, ISBN 0-935162-24-0

I had been reading Haniel Long's marvelous book If It Could Make Her So,
published by Frontier Press, in which he starts off with a very moving
exploration of Carnegie and the early labor Wars... describes Carnegie as a
very rich man who sometimes wanted to be good, but couldn't, and "threw
money over his shoulder to keep the ghosts away..." Now, I work in a
Carnegie library that was built with some of that money. Is it a good thing
or a bad thing that Carnegie used his blood money to build all these
beautiful libraries?

Flash forward to the Lilly gift. First thought: that's "drug" money, right?
Pharmaceuticals. Second thought: that's the way we do things in America. Let
98% of the artists starve, give 2% an endowment big enough to choke a
elephant, which essentially guarantees they won't be able to function
anymore as artists... (i.e. macarthur "genius" awards, etc.). Third thought:
let's see what they do with it, for christ's sake!!! Finally: I think it's
splendid for poetry. It's got people talking about it. This, along with the
Baraka flap and all the poet laureate hoo-hah, has actually made poetry
front-page news again. Clearly, no matter what everyone says, poetry DOES
matter. It mattered enough for someone to lay 100 big ones on a poetry mag
(whether you like it or not) and it matters enough for Amiri Baraka to be
getting death threats for a poem he wrote (whether you like it or not).

While it would be great for so much money to go to poetry, it is unfortunate
that that much money is going to Poetry. This magazine operates under a very
narrow definition of their name. Poetry magazine prints poetry that business
can claim the way they do their art collections.
And probably it's insignificant, since what does poetry mean to most folks
in America, even the Rich & Powerful.  But this gift seems, though probably
not intended, in line with the current Administration's commodification of
life. Governement should not fund art--business should. The profit margin
may be the cruelset taskmaster for artists.
Bottom line--Poetry magazine would not publish most of us to begin with and
probably still won't include us in however they spend their new- foudn
windfall. maybe more businesses will see literature as a traget for
generoisty. Otherwise we go on flinging our language, hoping to raise a
spark that will wake up a few thousand people and provide them another
vision.

Much as I share the anti-Bushy sympathies, I find this
equation suspect -- "commodification of life" a fact since
the industrial revolution, & not appreciably different under
Clinton, nor would it have been under Al Gore, despite the
little leading-thinker gabfests he used to hold when he was
VP. In some ways it's comforting to be "under Bush," because
hey, Bill C. bombed Iraq to get our minds off his cigar (or
to transmute cigar into rocket like that first scene in
Space Oddysey), so who's to say he wouldn't have followed
the can't-find-Osama-let's-bomb-Saddam(-again) trajectory
-- not that you're talking about the war, but it is a
crucible of character. And yet Clinton was so good at
scratching the liberal behind the ears and making us purr
-- I even think he was a real, committed liberal himself,
who got into the impossible position of heading a state
wherein commodification of life is just one of the
unmanageable paradoxes, policeman/exploiter of "the world"
and the oxymoron of representative democracy being others.

So, comforting under Bush, I was going to say, because like
good old Reagan he/it stares you right in the face: we are
dismantling pollution controls because we like
corporations and we don't like YOU. And the dumbness of his
rhetoric is comfortingly reflexive: "These killers will be
brought to justice," as though "justice" were a closed
circle and crime merely an eccentricity (certainly Bill C.
used this kind of rhetoric too, but didn't have the
let's-replace-logic-with-repetition style).
Bring-killers-to-justice = America can go back to playing
Nintendo. A rhetoric too lacking in rhetoric to mask its
motives.

I would settle for three people myself, JGallaher --
tripling my current audience. But seriously isn't it the
case that movements that catalyzed real change in the
literary ecosystem have tended to do so without any more
money or encouragement than your average struggling arts
organization of today? Not that, say, Pound should have had
to live as a pauper, but can you imagine him otherwise?

For those who heard the lecture at the 60s conference at Orono, and those
who didn't, my essay "The Turn to Language the 1960s" has hit the streets
in *Critical Inquiry*. The essay deals with the intersection of radical
politics and poetry in and around Berkeley in the 1960s. Poetry is not the
only genre covered; the essay also deals with photography  and documentary
film. The cover is, in fact, a photo by Ansel Adams of demonstrators at
Berkeley in 1966, carrying signs that read "I Oppose This War!"--just in
time for the next one. Now that's what I call a publishing opportunity!

I should be getting offprints soon, and if you are interested in receiving
one, let me know and I will send it along (if you will provide your mailing
address and three dollars).

To be fair:  Richard is alluding to positions that have already been set forth
precisely on this poetics list.   If you don't know that, you are "missing
something here."  The basic question isn't that unreasonable--though it's
inflamatory to a fault....

In fact, Andrea Brady has recently written a piece called "Grief Work in a War
Economy":  it's a critique of the response of certain language poets to 9/11--
including some of the figures Richard mentions, though not Barrett Watten.  For
those interested, it's in the latest issue of _quid_ and in _Radical
Philosophy_ (in a different version--I can't find a working link to it right
now, unfortunately....

But I would remind him that Al Qaeda, "terror," and Iraq are three

Since Richard Taylor has raised a question of my position on the war with
Iraq, I am happy to clarify. I am unequivocally opposed to war with Iraq.
What is being pursued here is American geopolitical dominance under the
cover of the war against terrorism. Poets, who are experts in the use of
language, should have no trouble decoding the flimsy rationales being advanced.

Having said that, it appears that Richard Taylor has not registered
positions on the war that I've taken on the listserv, such as the thread
with Nick Piombino on the "flag as transitional object" after 9/11. He
probably does not know what *Bad History* is about either, and has probably
never heard of Dan Davidson's *Iraqi* pin project (the subject of a section
of *Bad History* titled "Iraqi").

He also may not get the reference to the cover of *Critical Inquiry*. The
image itself is of an early student demonstration against the war in
Vietnam. The journal's editors put it on the cover as historical evidence,
I would imagine, but also as a comment on the present situation. It amounts
to a  reminder of the efficacy of the antiwar movement of the 1960s, in
which I took part. Its appearance makes an effective if ironic comment on
the present denial of opposition to the war.

LISTEN LITTLE MAN!


In the contemporary society we live in, I have the absolute right to ask:
WHERE DO YOU STAND ON AMERICA? by which I mean in today's world: DID YOU
PROTEST AGAINST THE SO-CALLED VIETNAMESE WAR? and in our current state: DO
YOU HAVE PROOF YOU DID PROTEST? by which I ask specifically: DO YOU HAVE
PHOTOGRAPHS, VIDEO, OR OTHER UNALTERED IMAGES OF YOUR PROTEST ACTIONS? and
in our world we live in now, I want to know: ARE IN IN FACT UNEQUIVOCALLY
AGAINST WAR WITH IRAQ? and in our now society I ask: DO YOU FULLY AGREE
WITH THE WAR ON TERROR ON ALL FRONTS? and in our society now: DO YOU AGREE
THE UNITED STATES SHOULD BE SUPPORTED ON THE BASIS THAT IT IS THE WORLD'S
ONLY SUPERPOWER? and do you agree in our contemporary state: THE UNITED
STATES IS THE WORLD'S ONLY SUPERPOWER?

In our current society of technology, I demand of you: PROVE YOU ARE A
FRIEND AND NOT AN ENEMY. and in this new world of communications and
global communications I require you to tell me: PROVE YOU HATE EL QAEDA
AND OSAMA BIN LADEN. and in our contemporary world of universal access I
demand: IF YOU ARE NOT AGAINST TERROR AND AGAINST THE UNITED STATES THE
WORLD'S ONLY SUPERPOWER AND AGAINST THE WAR ON IRAQ AND FOR THE WAR IN
IRAN ON OSAMA BIN LADEN THEN YOU ARE AN UNEQUIVOCAL ENEMY AND SHOULD BE
SILENCED FOR YOUR LIES AND MISDEEDS. and in this day of world-wide current
transportation I demand you answer this: DO YOU KNOW THE DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN BLACK AND WHITE? and if you answer this I ask you: DO YOU KNOW THE
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN GOOD AND EVIL?

In our crazy world of high fashion one moment and low fashion the next, I
require with full force of you that YOU PROVE YOUR STANCE AGAINST ALL EVIL
WAR AND YOU PROVE YOUR PATRIOTISM because in this current world we live in
of global treaties and mass corporations YOU ARE AN ENEMY UNLESS YOU ARE A
FRIEND and you should know THERE IS ONE RIGHT AND ONE RIGHT and you must
understand APOCALYPSE IS THE FINAL JUDGE AND JUDGMENT and you are my total
enemy AND THE ENEMY OF EVERY CONSCIOUS AND UNCONSCIOUS BEING if you do not
AGREE TO MY DEMANDS AND SHOW YOURSELF AND YOUR LYING WAYS to me and
everyone else SO THAT WE MAY EXPOSE YOU FOR WHO YOU ARE and WHETHER YOU
ARE STUPID OR NOT and whether YOU AND YOUR FAMILY ARE CONTAMINATED BY YOUR
LYING WAYS by the FINAL JUDGE AND JUDGMENT of the APOCALYPSE which is the
TRUTH OF THE WORLD AND YOU ARE NOT.

I liked this, only I didn't see the point of clicking from an html paage to
get to it and I also found the title to be pretentious.  I suppose that was
your joke though.  But the poetry generation is really good!  I like the way
it slices apart the phrases to get new ones which also appear to make sense,
and even tend to have a poetic sound structure.  Not sure I liked all the
visual distration but it is much better with it than just a plain screen
with a button and two lines of output as in other work youo've done....
Actually some of it I liked a lot -- the squares were cool and I wondered
how you did them!  Y9u have to remeber that for some people the animation
will be unbearably fast and for others unbearably slow.  This should not
happen as Flash claims to enforce a fixed frame rate, but it  doesn't!.  I
am on a 600mhz machine here (my mom's, my own is 900 mhz) and it seems
awfully fast.  But  I started using flash on a 75 mhz machine and my father
still has a 115 mhz machine and so I can't sshow him certain anumations
because things get out of sync with each other-- not just siounds and
graphics, but movie clip graphics and main timneline graphics.

This not a direct response to Barry W or R Taylor. I am, too, unequivocally
opposed to this what appears already an invasion in process. But, correct me
if I am wrong, the anti-war movement (or at least my register of my
participation and what's consumed via public media) has gone suddenly mute,
or dormant. On one hand, one can say that the magnitude of the  anti-war
demonstrations in both Europe and the USA (no matter how grossly unreported
in the NY Times) forced the Bush Administration to back Powell and the need
for UN Inspections and "allied approval." Indeed now there are 300 trained
inspectors apparently on rotation - a hundred at a time - examining
potential sites that may or may not possess weapons of mass destruction.
(God, would they have a hay day just working the Bay Area, and Nevada would
be a bonanza)! So that one may be led to imagine that I and the anti-war
movement have gone quiet as a form of faith - that faith being that Bush &
Company will accept and make decisions on empirical results of scientific
inquiry performed by Western masters of such. In the mean time, while "we"
be quiet, the Rumsfeld led choir boys of the right are insisting (albeit
hysterically and without any apparent factual foundation) through the media
to say they have absolutely no faith in what they consider an inspection
charade, i.e. the truth of empirical inquiry be damned: the war and its
objectives (the potential paradoxical elimination of weapons sites that
cannot be found) even if the Inspectors find nothing.
And it appears that the major media has acquiesced to this point of view -
mostly ignoring any anti-war point of view (since its suddenly invisible)
and is most invested in making sure the most powerful  among the "networks"
will have the most profitable front row seats in documenting the upcoming
spectacle.
In the horrible face of these forces working to make an inevitable war -
why has the the anti-war movement gone suddenly numb? It seems just a few
weeks ago that we filled the streets of this City (SF) so cheerily
determined. Who can pierce this vacuum with words?

Internet Philosophy and Psychology -                             11/26/02
                                                       (last was 08/02/02)


My recent work has been dealing with sexuality, terror, death, windows
onto worlds, the confluence of subtropical nature with subsumption neural
architectures. I have also been working on a series of 3D animations
(mixed with real-life video), pieces exploring the same themes in extreme
or extended spaces. An extended video, Trilby, was produced; more recent
videos include a Scan series, and Alberta.mov. (All available reduced on
cdrom.)


===


This is a somewhat periodic notice describing my Internet Text, available
on the Net, and sent in the form of texts to various lists. The URLs are
http://www.asondheim.org and http://www.anu.edu.au/english/internet_txt/
which is partially mirrored at
http://lists.village.virginia.edu/~spoons/internet_txt.html.

See http://www.asondheim.org/portal/ for new video/imagework; please note
this is for over-18/

The changing nature of the email lists, Cybermind and Wryting, to which
almost all of the texts are sent individually, hides the full body of the
work; readers may not be aware of the continuity among them. The writing
may appear fragmented, created piecemeal, splintered from a non-existent
whole. On my end, the whole is evident, the texts extended into the lists,
partial or transitional objects.

So this (periodic) notice is an attempt to recuperate the work as total-
ity, restrain its diaphanous existence. Below is an updated introduction.

-----

The "Internet Text" currently constitutes around 100 files, or 10,000
printed pages. It began in 1994, and has continued as an extended
meditation on cyberspace, expanding into 'wild theory' and literatures,
symptomologies of the edge.

Almost all of the text is in the form of short- or long-waves. The former
are the individual sections, written in a variety of styles, at times
referencing other writers/theorists. The sections are interrelated; on
occasion emanations are used, avatars of philosophical or psychological
import. These also create and problematize narrative substructures within
the work as a whole. Such are Susan Graham, Julu, Alan, Jennifer, Azure,
and Nikuko in particular.

The long-waves are fuzzy thematics bearing on such issues as death,
sexuality, virtual embodiment, the "granularity of the real," physical
reality, computer languages, and protocols. The waves weave throughout the
text; the resulting splits and convergences owe something to
phenomenology, programming, deconstruction, linguistics, philosophy and
prehistory, as well as the domains of online worlds in relation to
everyday realities.

Overall, I'm concerned with virtual-real subjectivity and its manifesta-
tions. I continue working on a cdrom of the last eight years of my work
(Archive), as well as a series of 3d animation and other videos, some of
which are on cdrom.

I have used MUDS, MOOS, talkers, perl, d/html, qbasic, linux, emacs, vi,
CuSeeMe, etc., my work tending towards embodied writing, texts which act
and engage beyond traditional reading practices. Some of these emerge out
of performative language - soft-tech such as computer programs which _do_
things; some emerge out of interferences with these programs, or conversa-
tions using internet applications that are activated one way or another.
And some of the work stems from collaboration, particularly video, sound,
and flash pieces.

There is no binarism in the texts, no series of definitive statements.
Virtuality is considered beyond the text- and web-scapes prevalent now.
The various issues of embodiment that will arrive with full-real VR are
already in embryonic existence, permitting the theorizing of present and
future sites, "spaces," nodes, and modalities of body/speech/community.

The texts are roughly in the order written; the last-entered at the moment
is mq. They may be read in any order, and distributed in any medium;
please credit me. I would appreciate in return any comments you may
have.

For information on the availability of cdroms containing the text and
other materials (graphics, video, sound, articles, books), see the appen-

Maria Damon wrote of "mainstream poetry":

"disingenuous of course, because always, the
evaluative, "craft-conscious" public is looking over the shoulder of
this solitary struggler, so the solitary struggle is a performance
for an audience. "


BUT

Maria (Hi!),

Is this because performance is itself fake in some way, inauthentic,
manipulative?  On that level, I'd say *all* art is disingenuous to some
extent, even for those mocking/faking/hoaxing the solitary struggle (e.g.,
Doubled Flowering), or for those not quite sure about the metaphysical
status of their performative actions (e.g., Spicer).  But on another level,
can not performance be candor itself?  I find that performance often makes
candor possible where it otherwise was not.  That is, at least for me, I am
more able to say what's on my mind in a performative space than in a private
space.  Not that I am confessional in most stretches of the critical
imagination.  (This need for performative space as an opportunity for candor
may not be the model of psychic health or "balance", but there it is, the
exception, nonetheless--it does happen.)  I know you were speaking of
"mainstream" work, but I fear that such a distinction seems only to occlude
evaluation of such an analysis as the one reflected in your above statement.

I'm not saying at all that I disagree with the gist of your post.  I am just
wondering about the genesis/origin of your statement about sincerity and
performance.

Yours,
Patrick

Subject:      "Blue Hyacinth" by Pauline Masurel

It's a pleasure to publish Pauline Masurel's piece "Blue Hyacinth" at
http://vispo.com/StirFryTexts/bluehyacinth3.html (requires IE 4+).

There's discussion between Pauline and me concerning "Blue Hyacinth" and the stir frys at
http://vispo.com/StirFryTexts/mazconv.htm .

"The story has already been written...her blue hyacinth voice.
The story has already been written another in the corner is smoking.
The story has already been written in colour.
The story has already been written and he's just here now to watch it played out."

In one of the four texts, we read of a night club owner's remote reaction to his blowing up a
rival night club called The Blue Hyacinth. In another, a woman describes the actions of someone
who broke into her house and left voice recordings on all her tapes, leaves voice messages on
her phone, "it goes on for months, her blue hyacinth voice." In another of the texts, a woman
relates of having won money bet on Blue Hyacinth at the track, and her own inexplicable giving
up of the winnings.

Masurel has used the mechanism of the stir fry to transform fictive stories/vignettes into a
vortex of poetry...and back again to fiction, as you please.

Many thanks to Pauline for "Blue Hyacinth" and its transformations through the shapes of fiction
and poetry.

There are now five stir fry texts involving various participants: Pauline, Brian Lennon, Leo
Marx, Jerome McGann, Talan Memmott, Mary Phillips, Joseph Weizenbaum, Lee Worden, and
translation into Chinese of one of them by Shuen-shing Lee. They have been published in the Iowa
Review Web, ubu.com, DOC(K)S from France, Taiwan, and offline in Denmark. The project was
started in 1999 and may or may not be finished according to whether the form inspires others to
do something different with it, as Pauline has.

The stir fry form keys on the DHTML innerHTML method which allows you to change the HTML code
inside a <SPAN> or <DIV>. Pauline's "Blue Hyacinth" can transform into
4^30=1,152,921,504,606,846,976 different texts as you mouse over it. So the 'whole thing' will
never be read. But neither need all 1,152,921,504,606,846,976 different texts be read to grasp
what we would call 'the meaning' of the piece.

As we move into combinatorially complex works, we realize that what it means to read a
combinatorium with subtlety and comprehension does not involve the necessarily impossible task
of reading all the possibilities of a combinatorium but, rather, getting a sense of the
directions in which the possibilities tend by sampling them until they begin to diminish in
significant difference. In the end, we see that the mind ranges very quickly through
1,152,921,504,606,846,976 despite its seeming insuperability. A text of
1,152,921,504,606,846,976 possibilities is still amenable to the creation of meaning on a human
scale not simply by disregarding most of the possibilities, but by virtue of the way the
underlying 4 texts guide the reader through primary (spanning set) spaces of meaning.

It's a sad comment, but your post really makes me feel
a better this morning.

One of the most sinkingest feelings I've ever felt was
all the pro-war talk on this list (mostly David Antin
but some others including the infamous "L.B.") in the
weeks and months after those attacks--

lovely and succinct post, Mr Watten--

Barret Ron David Etal.

(Even if Barrett had said he supported the war at  I would respect his view:
an attack for me in politics isnt necesarily an attack on any individual: we
all
have many viewpoints: mine are pretty cranky and uneven and I think I know
that...
I didnt want to embarrass or hurt anyone and feel no animosity even to D.
Antin
(altho his dissertation on rats was a bit of a worry!!) Despite what I say
below I
know that I may be wrong, completely wrong: I hope I'm not, but please
abuse, inform,
scorn, correct, flame, threaten, curse at, or ignore me as you see fit!!
My defence is: "Humanum est errare.")

Ok I used "shock tactics" but I am anguished over the situation now of the
US and Britain (and my country I believe is backing them secretly despite
the crap they tell us).   But some points.

1) Self criticism and criticism.  I can understand how people can come to be
so frightened for the future etc that they would come to support an
anti-terrorist campaign.  In fact  - its true Barrett that I missed your
threads etc I only
"picked on" you because I saw something about a photo on something
that referred to the Vietnam War days.

In fact my first response to S11 was anti terrorism I went into a spiral and
wanted to obliterate all the Arabs! I'm embarrased by that now but the way
the news of it reached me (us even in NZ) was cataclysmic.  However as time
went by I chanaged my position(s)

Its true as David Hadbawnik implies that I should maybe say these things to
people's faces: would I have the courage to say them if I wasnt here hiding
behind a keyboard? Good point - but as I concurrred with Murat: its that
very
paradox  of the (seeming) irreality of  the net that enables us to speak of
things
 we would otherwise fear (it could get
one into trouble!) [ Mind you in New Zealand its a bit hard to speak
directly to
Monsieur Watten Etal in person!] As someone pointed out a long time ago: how
would I react to an attack on Auckland? Ok I'd want a very thorough
investigation - now and I wouldnt believe all I heard BUT I know things
are very different if you are there and as someone else (on the BBC) pointed
out its not so convincing to refer to "the starving millions" etc (although
reading John Pilger etc is
good) as its very hard to grasp such big number s mean much less than seeing
people:
jump from windows and so on.... now either a) S11 was a brilliant pro war
activating stunt   or b) it was done by terrorists etc  c) other

It would be easy (being a New Yorker) to go for the "Axis of Evil" line  -
whether one knows it is true or not; whether it is true or not.

2) (and so on) I think one problem raised by Ron's reply, is the question:
"What is
terrorism?" In fact is it (terrorism) a constant comcommitant of war
nowadays
and at any other historical time? - I think terrorism in one form or another
has been
and probably will be a "military tactic" for centuries and also is/has
always been
used by the various States to maintain power...various kinds of terror.

But is terrorism: as we  "vaguely concur" on it - well, what is it? What is
terrorism?  In
Palestine (and I know that in Algeria there were "suicide" bombers in the
resistance to the French) now I think that both terrorism and suicide
bombers are misnomers.  In Palestine its questionable that  the word
"suicide" is accurate.  In a sense - forget any religious aspects for a
moment  - all higher mammals "commit suicide", or more accurately, they are
prepared to sacrifice their lives or the group or their progeny etc so some
"immortatlity" might be ensured. Similarly, soldiers "die for their country"
and so on. [I must admit I read these ideas recently in a book about
death and suicide by a woman called Chesser - oddly enough the book gave me
strength in my own "angst" about death.]

 In Vietnam the Buddhists burnt them selves to death as a
protest. In desperation and hatred people who have lost everything -
families, loved ones, homes, businesses, farms, villages and so on: or who
empathise with others' loss, give their lives ..they are thus heroes ( can
be termed so):
 they have nothing to match the Israeli weapons much bigger than machine
guns, some
anti-tank,missiles, and
hand-grenades: Israel has all that and tanks, helicopters, missiles, and
nuclear weapons -weapons of mass destruction, in fact - and ships and
submarines:
and a powerful airforce: and a wel fed and US backed army. So, as did the
Jews of Warsaw
people fight with next to nothing, so do these people (the Palestinians) (I
can also understand
in a complex way the position of the Zionists but I wont go into that now
I mean that i can see that tey also are struggling for survival
 (or think they are - or they are - but obviously these are complex
questions..)
A person totally ready to sacrifice  their life is an
effective and potent military weapon and no more "evil" than a daisy cutter
bomb or a bulldozer.
They are not progressing humanity in general - they may be in th elong run -
it might seem but are freedom fighters for their own group.  (I'm well aware
that hearts "(are) grow(ing) brutal with the fare" ...)
If Britain had been overrun by the Nazis and Russia defeated and so on:
"suicide" and other terrorist tactics would/could be seen by either the
Russians or the British as
legitimate: not everyone's cup of tea: but possibly viable and
understandable. At a certain point
"terrorism" is legitimate  ( or as legitimate as say,  complete passivity)
 (there are grey areas of course such as the allies use of  fire bombing in
the Second World War and so on): in fact it can/could be be renamed as
 patriotism or freedom fighting, even heroism.

So I think that terrorism - the war on terrorism is linked by the US
military political  planners -
to those on the defensive: those form countries destryed by the US and so
on:
it is part of a complex struggle against Imperialism. It is in fact the
class struggle
taken to its highest possible level by the reality of history as it is now.
terrorism though, in
a cold and purely tactical appraisal, is generally not employed as a main
tactic (except that
it is actually a constant component of any offensive/defensive war,
rebellion etc) by
those engaged in war and especially not by those conducting a peoples' war.
(This is why I am dubious S11 was carried out other than by hte US Secret
Serviceor someone
other than those supporting the Palestinian people's struggle: mind you it
had value as a kind of
spectacle  "Look what we can do!"  "We can run rings around big bad Him US"
so maybe
it was carried out by Muslims...who knows?)
 ( But generally  (terrorism) is well
known to have mainly have negative-positive propaganda value: thus we now
have everyone
on edge about "terrorists" so Astralia eg can be conned into the (possibly
endless)
"War on Terror")...

So I am opposed not to the war on terrorism: I'm in favour of terrorism or
what I think of as
"freedom fighting"  (when negotiation and all else have failed)
and the Al Qaeda as well if they are opposed to US and British (and any
other)
Imperialism...but I think that one day  a more
broad based peoples' movment will replace the Al Qaeda.  However
I'm not a member! I've said all  this beacuse I feel I can conflate the war
against Iraq and
Bush etc raving on about terrorism: its absolutely hypocritical given that
the US bombarded
Iraq with what the (US Army's own physicist in charge of cleaning up the
uranium etc in Kuwait)
termed: "weapons of mass destruction" which included depleted uranium and
also pure Uranuim
in tank shells: and the US's and British support of gecnocide against the
Iraqi people and the Kurds:
and their support and military supply of Hussein for so many years.

However as Alan's post "says" (or seems to) in a way its not my "business"
where people
stand: in a sense
I am dubious that the Al Qaeda is in fact not a secret arm of the CIA and am
also dubious of the existence of Bin Laden. But even if the CIA are making
up what he says I
agree with everything I've read from him (athough I'm skeptical that what he
says IS what he says
and so on! I get to a position of supporting the CIA!!)

I'm also opposed to the war against Iraq and feel that the US and Britain
should remove
from Saudi Arabia (as does Bin Laden), Israel, Turkey, Turgistan etc,
Afghanistan, and any other
they are oppressing or occuppying. I see the US and Britain as "the axis of
evil" two of the
most dangerous and terroristic bullying and aggresive  countries on this
earth. I can understand
terrorist (for me read revolutionary) counterattacks against Imperialism and
it's devastations.
These are national and religious and  cultural revolutions/struggles (and to
some extent economic struggles):
they are ultimately class struggles but that connection is more subtle.

[But of course the import of my questions were directed to some of the
language poets
- and I know a parallel debate raged about a year ago - because of their
flirtation
with Marxism.  I wanted some reaction - there is an eerie silence - maybe
that's my ego.
What can I do about it anyway? Does it matter what anyone's stance is?]

So: what should be done?
I would far rather (than terrorism and aattack counterattack and so on)
see a United Nations with people leading who had the
guts to oppose the
arrogant bullying and bribing of the US and the Churchillian British. Get
into Israel: and by force or
other methods set up a truly democratic state there (a buffer zone first)
rather than what I see as
a theocratic and arrogant State ( a religious state: less secular than
Iraq ).

But I dont think it will happen: whether Bin Laden said it or not, I like
it:

"..those who bomb shall be bombed."

Am I going to go to Iraq or wherever and take part in revolution and get
killed: no. I'm probably a coward as far as that sort of thing goes and for
now
am an enthusiastic armchair revolutionary...I might take part in some street
marches but despite the above like many people I live inside myself mostly.
I  would
probably never join any "revolutionary" group as I dont like groups:
I am by nature and (background - lets; be honest I've had things pretty easy
in my own life here in NZ - touch wood no major illnesses and life
is as good as eating WCW's plums).  However dont know what I will do
if the US does attack Iraq. I hope I stay calm.

What about negotiation and passive struggle a la Ghandi?...my perception is
that the Palestinians are always open to negotiation: it doesnt seem to be
reciprocal. However, in all cases, before one blows one self up, or goes to
war,
negotiation and discussion are best until it is seen that the "opposition"
are not interested in negotiation.

This morning's news includes a demand from the chief inspector that Iraq
provide a very strong case to prove it *doesn't have wmds

and that Iraq's report must answer all the evidence provided in "portfolios"
to show that Iraq *does have wmds - that's the evidence that says "we know
you have them but we're not saying how we know

Both are impossible to comply with

Oh yes, and the right to use nukes because theyre so good against chemical
and biological - for once "weapons of mass destruction" wasn't used to
describe... er "our" weapons

there;s actually a very healthy anti-war movement, but it's not
taking to the streets; i think during the reagan era that became
discredited as a form of registering public opinion (remember the
rise of the "opinion poll" during those years?).  instead, the
internet has been a prime organizing force; groups like moveon.org
and truemajority have been pretty effective in mobilizing mass
activity like faxing, phone calls and money-raising.  i'm not sure
bush even really wants war --but he sure wants to scare us into
thinking we need to go to war --and then when we're all looking at
iraq, or afghanistan, or yemen, he turns the u.s. into a police state.

ps i'm opposed to the war too, obviously.

well of course you're right, (perhaps it was disingenuous of me to
say disingenuous?) but in "meanstream" lyric i mean mainstream, it's
the emphasis on the content of solitude, and sincerity about that
solitude, is suspect perhaps, disingenuous.  for example, stopping by
woods on a snowy evening.  it's so full of its own solitude, and
wanting to be praised for it!

For what it's worth, the NewsHour with Jim Lehrer ran an entire segment on
the growing antiwar movement that is in fact taking it to the streets. (not
that the NewsHour is any decent barometer, but...) It showed a bit of the
organization going on in Chicago, which the NewsHour tagged as the most
vocal antiwar movement in the States...

In terms of "performance," it all depends on the performer's/s' motives.
What is it that they are trying to convey? During the mid-90s, I along with
a group of poets spent a great deal of time performing with the Boston free
jazz band, The Fully Celebrated Orchestra. In addition to the poets from
compost, we had an artist collaging our set on large swaths of craft paper.
The collages were/are beautiful. Nonetheless, we spent a great deal of time
talking with the band about what we were trying to do, what attitude we
were trying to put forth. Our approach was to attempt to get on stage and
talk as if we were talking to our friends on the street, which some could
say that this is performance as well. But, we certainly weren't the Tiger
Lillies who go up on stage trying to create a space that recalls a west
bank bordello... (saw the T.L.'s recently -- fantastic performance)

Subject:      Poetics of annihilation
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"; format=flowed

By way of a response to Richard Taylor, via Alan Sondheim, I'll put forward
two examples of what one might term a "poetics of annihilation" that have
come up recently.

1) At the Kathy Acker conference this month, I spoke of her fascination
with the figures of Patty Hearst and the Symbionese Liberation Army as one
of the ways she dealt with questions of identity, or more accurately
nonidentity. It may be true that Patty Hearst was both daddy's little girl
and "Tanya" simultaneously, thus bringing the psychodynamics of "acting
out" into mainstream politics. The SLA was important because its politics
were so dissociated as to have no serious  credibility; it was thus a
perfect specimen of a radical irrationalism that would be used to define
"the terrorist" as a moment of discourse--i.e., a negativity that holds
consensus politics together. When several members of the SLA were
surrounded and killed in a Compton safe house, we had the spectacle of
total state violence mobilized against an isolated irrationalist threat. I
would propose that current social discourses of terrorism derive from such
events. The consequence of the Patty Hearst/SLA episode was to remove
oppositional politics from normative discourse and thus create a mode of
social (re)production of irrational acts and state violence. In an
important way, reading Acker can give us insight into the way we
discursively inhabit this relationship.

2) The current film *8 Mile* might seen for what it can tell us about some
of the social conditions of poetic speech. The film constructs a version of
Detroit seen from the perspective of Eight Mile Road, the traditional
dividing line between majority black Detroit and the majority white
suburbs. The usual problematic is how does one get *through* Eight
Mile--either to escape the inner city, or to make contact with the denied
reality of it, depending on perspective. Here, the question is how to get
*off* Eight Mile literally as an organizing dynamic; the hero white rapper
(Rabbit, a.k.a. eminem) has got to resolve the unresolvable contradictions
that define him from both sides of the line. This can only be done through
poetry, in real time performance, in typical display behavior. The
interesting part of the film, however, is precisely how Rabbit gets off
Eight Mile (or is on his way toward doing so) by retreating from and
turning inward the modes of aggression that are the lingua franca of his
culture. His nonexistence (white trash in majority black culture) is thus
both source and solution to his dilemma, yielding an inspired performance
onstage that is precisely the "nonsolution that signifies," formulated as
the avowal of his own nonexistence, irrelevance, castration. Poetic speech
becomes an avowal of negativity within a contradictory social condition
that would otherwise result in the poet's annihilation, where the only way
*through* is *in*.

Attention administrators, listmembers!

Apparently due to computer difficulties, our good friend Bob has been booted
from the list.  He needs assistance to facilitate his return.  A welcome home

He and I have been trying to contact the list manager (is it still Chris?)

If my library out on an island in the North Atlantic does then I'm sure

I appreciate being confronted on my views on this list because I strongly
believe in the value of open discussion. But in order to clarify why I feel
the way I do I have to be talk a bit about why, not only on a
political/conceptual basis but on a personal one as well. When 9/11 hit I
can't emphasize too much how grateful I felt to have an opportunity to air
my feelings and views on this list.  Before 9/11 I kind of noticed the list
and once in awhile participated, but, to say the least, it was on the back
burner of my mind and life. Since then participating here has become not
only important to my daily life, but crucial. The reason is, my overall
feeling about political discussion was- when it comes to literal discussion,
who really gives a damn about what I have to say, especially when it comes
to specifics? My approach was to communicate my views and philosophy through
my writing. On the other hand, I listen closely to what other people have to
say very carefully as I have friends who have thought all these things
through a lot more carefully, and I may say successfully, than I have or
probably ever will. Obviously, Barrett Watten is one of these people, him
and the people he dialogues with regularly. I wrote what I wrote about flags
because during the Vietnam war I became a member of the Resistance led by
David Harris and burnt my draft card and participated in all the Columbia
University demonstrations and traveled to Berkeley and Washington DC to
participate in demonstrations. Since that time I have thought a lot about
political polarization in the US and this concerns me very deeply. I
appreciated my debates with Barrett because I learn from them. My initial
reaction to 9/11 was a desire to leave New York. A lot of poet friends, plus
my wife convinced me not to do this. Over time I seem to be coming closer to
Barrett's clear stand against the war against Iraq. I am strongly against
war philosophically, but I am very concerned about the threat of terrorism
here in New York and everywhere else. I do not support George Bush's
policies about the war, about the war on terrorism, nor his domestic
policies on nearly every issue. I am heartened and cheered by anti-war
demonstrations when I hear about them anywhere. On the other hand, I guess I
have the feeling that if the US doesn't rattle its sabers and show a
willingness to check and stand up to bullies, we may be giving a signal to
them and their allies to go ahead hit some more. I do not feel it is
possible to dialogue too much about these issues. I feel that there is as
much to fear in people taking frozen stands as there is to fear in
terrorism. In my view, if stands are frozen, it is because the people taking
them frozen with fear and rage, which can only ignite the problem further.
Anything anyone of us can do to to lower the rhetoric of war is valuable. On
the other hand, if the polarization becomes too intense, the entire problem
will be exacerbated. War can never ever be a solution to any social problem;
but giving in to violence passively can also increase the aggression of
bullies. As I've said before, we are surrounded by bullies. So what do we
do? Say go ahead and fight it out? Tell one of them I'm on your side? Ignore
the whole thing?  Standing up to bullies, whether they are terrorists or
American presidents has to be an option. How many peace marchers do we see
lining the streets of Washington? How many peace marchers do we see in the
cities of the Middle East? Nothing tires me more than empty slogans. As
Antonio Porchia put it: "When the superficial wearies me, it wearies me so
much I need an abyss in order to rest."

Years ago I wrote an article "Annihilation: To the Limit!" - dealing with
both (a critique of) marxism and a tendency to get it done with, in other
words, bring it on. The problematic of terrorism isn't the destruction -
it's the hiatus which is psychoanalytically filled with projections/intro-
jections; that's the state we're dealing with - or that rather is being
dealt to us - Alan

Raised in a Barn #3

This beautiful little journal is accepting submissions of prose fiction and
creative essays for its third issue.

http://www.massdeportation.org/

I had poems in the second issue (the editors removed the line breaks to
make them prose), which was really a well-produced, pleasant literary
object.

Alan has an interesting point about terrorism...bring things on =
...that's interesting: but how much of the political sitiuation is =
"informing" our writing  poetics now. I find it difficult to write these =
days...however I dont know how much that is my distraction in the "rage" =
to earn a crust or the politics is intruding: sometimes i wish all this =
would go away: its like a monstrous dream. thank god for valium and a =
little booze.=20

Nick I know where you're coming from: I found that in 1993 the only way =
I could cope with NY (which is a fantastic place) was to get boozed evey =
night! This was way before I connected politics with lit....I was trying =
to avoid politics right up to S11... its strange but I'm quite =
indifferent to what happens (with some exceptions) in NZ  eg Air NZ is =
being sold but I simply dont care and there endless murder trials and I =
just dont read about them (except  I'm interested in the trial of a cop =
as it may effect the legal psosition of my own son and possibilities of =
reparations and apologies and also psychological benefits and social =
depending on how it goes)...but just about everything else that happens =
in NZ I m indifferent to: including sport but I watch to see what's =
happenning in Israel an Iraq..that's all I'm interested in...strange)...

But I dont write much that is "consciousy" or overtly political...or do =
i ...how do oters react cope respond. Apologies I havent read Ron's Blog =
yet or Barrett Watten's response.=20

I am interested in this project...  Although I have my hand in many pots
these days and tend to stop and spend an afternoon doing soimething
ludicrous and silly (see my "call for work" to follow).

I gather with the reference to InnerHTML that this only works on IE, not
Netscape 4.  Does it work on NS 6 & 7?

How hard is it to stri fryify one's text?  Do all the authors use the same
algorithm, say the one you created and posted on Vispo?  Or is creating the
algorithm the main part of creating thhe stir fry work? To me, the main part
would be choosing what chunks could be modified, and whether they would just
be rollovers, cycling through a long list of replacements for that spot, or
instead a more interesting algorithm that moves some texts around thereby
changing emphases and meanings.

Do you do this to one large text, use stir fryification to crteate a text
from scratch based on an existing text you have wriotten but do not use
explicitly in the piece, or can you rewrite existing texts?  I want to use a
certain body of short texts, not one long text, and I'd like to make new
texts in the series perhaps, but maybe let the reader see the "real" texts"
first....  But this is just idle speculation in a way.  I;lll really do it
if the prpcess is not tooo long and consists of creative work, but if it
onvolves a lot of re-typing texts with brackets and commas and quotes aded,
I probably willl give up....

of His True Nature
=20


        Claymore Smith sat in his favorite armchair munching on =
madeleines, happily listening to tales of maiming and accidental death =
in post-Khmer Rouge Cambodia.  He enjoyed hard news, especially anything =
one could get indignant about on moral grounds which also carried vivid =
imagery he
could savor.
=20
        Then he heard the sentence: "Five year-old Dat lost three toes, =
one ear, and a foot to a Claymore in her grandmother's rice paddy."  A =
Claymore, Claymore thought!  I am a land mine?
=20
        The next time he talked to his former draft resister, SDS-member =
father he popped the question: "Dad, am I adopted?"
=20
        "How did you find out after all this time?  We tried so hard to =
conceal it from you because we didn't want the influence of your birth =
family to corrupt our liberal upbringing.  You see, your father was a =
hero. A Green Beret.  Who named his first son after his favorite weapon. =
 He got a medal for killing a twelve year-old armed with a pineapple.  =
He thought it was a grenade..."
=20
        "Oh my God, I'm a land mine!"
=20
        "No, dear, you were simply the product of a sick sociological =
system.  Individuals aren't to blame.  I hope you don't hate your =
father. He was a brave man."
=20
        "You are my father.  But maybe not.  How could you be the father =
of a landmine?"
=20
        "Don't be prejudiced.  Not everyone is enlightened.  It was a =
dismal period, when you were born.  No one knew what to believe.  It's =
not his fault.  He probably was a good man.  He probably thought he was =
doing good. You mustn't be judgmental..."
=20
        "But you are human!"
=20
        "What do you mean?"
=20
        "A human couldn't be the father of a land mine.   Plus, when do =
I blow up?"
=20
        "Son?"
=20
        "Am I pressure sensitive?  Or remote controlled.  I must be =

This is not true :-) There is an urban ledged going around town that Pepsi
is going to be the next terrorist attack. The tale (as I have heard it many
times from different people have many variations but) goes something like
this: A person goes into a store and helps out an older foreign woman and
she is so impressed with this person's random act of kindness that she tells
the person to not drink Pepsi anymore and it will soon be poison. Go figure
:-)

God, George, me too. When I look in the mirror first thing
in the morning I have to stop myself from calling Tom Ridge
to report that the terrorists have been fucking with my
hair in the middle of the night. One day I won't be able to
stop myself. That's when I'll know the terrorists have won.

Yesterday my cat finally got fed up with me. "Does
everything always have to be about terrorists?" she meowed.
"In this case, yes," I insisted. "Because when it's code
yellow, I'm supposed to be on the fucking lookout."

It didn't much surprise me that my ex-wife turned out to be
a terrorist. But she's not the one messing with my hair.
Could it be the cat? What would Tom Ridge say if I called
him to report my cat?

He'd probably laugh in his affable way and say, "Don't
worry, Damian, we've got pet surveillance pretty much tied
up. If your cat had been tousling your pompadour in the wee
hours, believe me, I'd already know about it."

It's a comforting thought, but it still doesn't answer the
basic question. Now that I've crossed ex-wife and cat off
the list, who's left? I do have a lot of ants in the
bathroom all of a sudden. God knows those little fuckers
are capable of concerted effort. But ants stand to gain so
little if the terrorists win, it's hard to fathom why they'd
get involved. Unless ...

Wait, that's it -- the ants, they're completely outside the
loop of Total Information Awareness! Do they even have
fingerprints? A little hair-displacement en route from
computer to bedroom window is the only trace of their
nefarious nocturnal operations.

It's all starting to fall into place. These ants -- they
have no citizenship status, no social security numbers.
They don't pay taxes. They live in basically the equivalent
of caves. In fact, don't those little tunnels have CELLS in
them?

The big question now -- I'd really better call Tom -- is
this: did Osama teach the ants everything they know, OR DID
THE ANTS TEACH OSAMA?



(Sorry, bad head cold,
Damian)

Inspection Team Arrives in Las Vegas
Albert Moon

Las Vegas, Nevada (NDP) -- U.N. weapons inspectors preparing for their first
day of work in the United States say they will "freeze" the buildings they
enter to prevent any evidence being smuggled out.

Inspectors are preparing to use state-of-the-art equipment when they begin
their search for alleged weapons of mass destruction on Wednesday.

Inspectors believe Pentagon officials may smuggle documents or evidence out
as inspectors go into nuclear test sites, offices and factories and say they
will now prevent anyone moving in or out of the buildings.

The 17 inspectors include 11 from the U.N. Monitoring, Verification and
Inspection Commission (UNMOVIC), who will focus on chemical and biological
weapons, and 6 from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) who will
investigate any nuclear weapons capability.

Demetrius Perricos, head of the atomic team, told reporters Tuesday that
state-of-the art equipment was necessary "because the eyes can fool
anybody."

"You can enter a room which is empty, but that room might have a history and
only if you are taking samples or doing some measurements you can find out
that the room is not as empty as you thought it was," he said.

Inspectors have showed reporters some of the high-tech equipment they will
use -- including devices that allow for rapid detection of the presence of
chemical, biological, or nuclear substances that may indicate a facility has
been used for developing weapons capability.

Inspectors will take air samples and "swipes" of objects within a site, as
well as other types of samples, and examine them for things such as
radioactive isotopes. They will also seal up some objects.

Information will be sent immediately to laboratories in Moscow and Vienna.

Information collected from the inspections will be cross-referenced against
files showing what substances should be present given the site's official
purpose.

"Technology of today is having much progress in terms of what it provides
for a rapid detection of biological or chemical substances," Perricos said.

Pointing to the relatively small size of the detection devices, he said:
"Thank God they made it portable and not just transportable."

Perricos was asked whether the arms monitors would be looking for suspected
mobile biological weapons laboratories in trailers identified previously as
houses of prostitution. "We have some plans," he said.

Perricos said ground-penetrating radar would be used to locate possible
buried storage or production sites.

Jacques Baute, head of the U.N. Monitoring, Verification and Inspection
Committee (UNMOVIC) said: "We are fully conscious of the responsibility we
have on our shoulders.

"We have an access anywhere and access anywhere is translated into
inspections to any type of facilities.

"Anytime is one of the key parameters regarding the credibility of the
conclusions, and another translation is immediate access.

"If we have access immediately to a site the credibility of our conclusion
if we find nothing there is far higher than if there is any notice, even of
one or two hours."

Under the terms of Resolution 1441, passed this month, Washington must
provide a list of their weapons of mass destruction to the Security Council
by December 8.

The United States has vowed to meet the deadline and has said inspectors
will be given complete access to all sites.

The U.N. inspectors are to report to the Security Council by late January on
their initial round of inspections, including whether the Americans have
been fully cooperative.

The United States  has assailed the resolution and called it a result of the
desire of the members of the United Nations to eliminate its right to bear
nuclear arms in support of regional enforcement of international oil and
trade agreements.

Former chief U.N. weapons inspector Scott Ritter rejected Washington's
claims.

"Washinton has lied to the world for a very long time about its weapons
program," he told CNN's Bagdad Morning with Paula Zahn.

Butler said the United States has a history of lying to the U.N. "This is a
long- standing American approach, but they can't take that approach this
time," he said.

"This current resolution of the Security Council is black and white, it
makes very clear, you will tell the truth or else, and I hope they get
that."

Meanwhile, CNN Pentagon Correspondent Barbara Starr said the United Nations
Navy will have four aircraft carriers within striking distance of the United
States at some point in mid-December -- but U.N. military officials have
emphasized they have no reason to believe the congregation of warships could
mark the beginning of any attack on the United States. The assembling of
such a large number of carriers is said to be an accident of a global
preservation and deployment schedule and the overlap should only exist for a
few days.

I do agree with this.  Perhaps in order to close our seeming linguistic gap,
we could say that such a poem as Frost's is *deliberately* disingenuous, and
perhaps its deliberately so for marketing purposes.  I don't really know
about the market intents of that poem of his in particular, or any others
for that matter, but of course it seems it is a reasonable guess to say that
it is.  Authenticity, especially authentic solitude, is good business in
poetry.  Get one of them thar $100k prizes for poetry...that's not any
piddling amount of dough.  Even in Manhattan that's a decent down payment on
a piece of real estate.  Some people will do "what it takes," or rather,
what takes it: the money.  Oh the fame, & the seeming immortality--those
too.

But how or why, I now wonder, do we want to draw a line between us and those
mainstreamers crap-ola-ing poetry?  I mean, I saw that article in the
NYTimes (was it there?) about Bernstein.  Here's more "one of us" than "one
of them" though he is regularly accused by people I respect highly as just
another "one of them."  That article was just awful, sophomoric, cheap, and
done in front of so many people.  Maybe Bernstein's largest audience.  That
was the outside world drawing a line around some of us right here.  Anyway,
this sort of us/them gesture getting anywhere near poets is beginning to
make me nervous.  I'm just as bad, if not worse, than the next person.
Maybe it's because my wife is teaching me how to pick my battles--I think I
am finally beginning to understand this concept.  And so I'm afraid now to
pick battles with other poets, because to the world outside of poetry
looking in, we're all nothing but shit it seems--every last one of us.  Just
in time for America to create its own spin-off into a world domination
machine repressing just about everything inside or out.  Confessional or no,
a poet might just equal a problem to everyone that's not a poet soon enough.
(At least outside urban areas...so many non-poets in NYC seem to be
sympathetic to poets, for example.  There are of course exceptions and they
will remain.)

I am in mind of the myth of the Jesus story about not casting the first
stone: maybe telling people it is wrong for some fantastic reason instead of
telling them the truth is more effective.  It seems more poetic in some
fucked up way.  If a person casts a stone, others are more ready to cast
stones, and we might just end up getting a whole lot of stone-throwing.  But
telling people the truth won't stop 'em: so give the people "sin."
*Something* other-worldly: tell them it'll put them on a never-ending
hayride through hell. Telling people the truth sometimes leads us away from
the truth.  That really sucks.  Ugh.  Did I just write that?  Tell a lie,
we're fucked; tell the truth, we're fucked.  Tell a lie, tell the truth,
tell a lie, tell the truth, is how the joke goes ("What did Raggedy Ann say
to Pinocchio as she was sitting on his face?")

I wonder about this different sense of candor to which I was referring, the
sort of candor that is also artful.  And full of art (or at least plodding
along that line).  I can't be sincere in order to be sincere.  That is of
course inherently conflicted, yet there it is.  Here I am, displaying
sincerity in an inherently artful & public arena.  I do think my
disingenuousness is OK, because it brings along with it my candor.  Perhaps
I think I can only get the truth with exaggeration or a series of other
deceptive/manipulative gestures.  But I have to wonder, how much different
am I than Frost perhaps?  Other than the talented or famous or mainstream
categories, of course.  How many of us poets are free of such complications?
I doubt when it comes down to it very few of us are.  And I'm scared of
those left over. :)

Even an emoticon seems both genuine and disingenuous simultaneously.

A poem from anyone seems to me a ploy, a stratagem, whether it be for
self-expression, self-denial, cash, or anything in between, even if the poem
de-ploys the ployishness of a poem.  Even that sort of (perhaps
deconstructive) poem is still is in itself that gesture of desire for
something or other.  Even a randomly generated computer poem falls into that
category of being in some way a ploy.  Something disingenuous always seems
to be present in a poem.  Assonance, for example.  Formal stricture.  Poetic
diction.  Displaying it in an audience.  Etc.  Maybe even the very formation
or use of any word, in any context, through any medium, for that matter.

Please forgive me if I'm beginning to sound like Stuart Smalley.  You know
the SNL character: "I'm Good Enough, I'm Smart Enough, and, Doggone it,
People Like Me..."

well of course you're right, (perhaps it was disingenuous of me to
say disingenuous?) but in "meanstream" lyric i mean mainstream, it's
the emphasis on the content of solitude, and sincerity about that
solitude, is suspect perhaps, disingenuous.  for example, stopping by
woods on a snowy evening.  it's so full of its own solitude, and
wanting to be praised for it!

ok --again, points well taken.  it seems to me --and this is not
ironclad --that alternative poetries do *not* dwell on bourgeois
solitude as the ideal circumstances under which poetry can be
written.  community is much more important, or the completely radical
solitude of the prison cell, which ain't all that solitary.  so there
is no need to create a division between
appearance-of-masterful-solitude (as opposed to the abject solitude
or isolation of the yearning adolescent, the prisoner or the
psychiatric inmate) and performing-for-an-audience.

No Chance of Parole

1.
Suspicions, your main concern in gawk-eyed,
shadowy tetchiness of yet another dance school. Throw somebody

into disarray at tête-à-têtes of clustered fabrics in the school's
nutritional regime, wrung from scenes of carnage, matrimonial voyages

divinely beyond swoops of description,
navigable every now and then.

2.
Witlessly vulgar language hustled, blushing shabbily, new to
the job in typography, usurping eye-openers in some movie-theater megaplex.

Thunderstruck huskiness blurted out, chimed with blue eyeliner, gawkily
unnewsworthy, now near enough to hear fabrications, wrong side up in a snow flurry.

Nowhere to be found, sworn statements fly in the face of misconstruction,
blindly clutching, prying your eyes out. "Thank goodness," the soothsayer saith,

impulsively and glumly. Lying face down and taking twenty thwacks
down in the dark of the scintillating caverns, tethered inch by inch, thudding,

chewing away at the cud. Idle talk tyrannizing our system of government,
hustling and bustling, lying under oath, caviling systematically.

3.
Handpicked novices sterilizing bayonets before rustling up known
malefactors, beyond description by word of mouth.

Matrimonial fruitlessness, as is well known in syrupy fables, synthesized
baying at the moon, wet behind the ears, hovering vivacious dynamite eyes,

makeup trying to make an impression on our sullen mystifications, thus far flying off
the handle sveltely, yet meticulously. Nuts about guillotining, yet near enough

to hear indescribable scuttlebutt cavorting, feuding with nuts and bolts,
sewing up a bit of fun: "Cutthroat world. Feverish Mutating Fuddy-Duddies."

4.
Squirming, cabaret-wizened youngsters, third-rate yet fusty, wet with weather
following on in the byways of mystique. Nippy textbook diffusions, thankful belief

systems that brook no questions, no matter how mixed up we are, how dry
our throats. Fatefully no-win situations as ferryboats sound their horns

in the well-whittled fog, sounding as if, as they say. Whistled away at, wrong side up
until, thunderstruck, we scrupulously read the whys and wherefores of futuristic

dyings off, rustling in opposition to tableaux, gymnastically the worse for wear, hurt
feelings to no avail. "I'm sorry?" I said. Tsk. Vituperative taxonomies, whiz kids toiling

at sub-minimum-wage jobs, eyesight dimming, yet not much to see beyond
the median, beyond that insipid dirt bike they rode in on, their ditzy

cultural attaché, dozing away at some spa.

the dumb-waiter was right


there was a lamp in the windows eye and a dreamer curtains. one could
discern certain shapes, it was a paradoxical drumroll, thus I freely
extolled such and such and to name it. controlled by luck and "can you
spare a dime" at local bargain hamlet store. without an indication from
the shadows I drove my metaphor to the ocean and made a scene of it.
jumping ahead, during a sultry june heat and pubescent december drill,
orders were given in an all out scary scene of sunday  on the pillage.
there were replays of carnage decisions and overpaid blood sacrifices.
the pure of heart rejoiced. on the edge of something was throughout, a
fortune was named, the right question to the right answer, and an all
out hunger for digits. then something else, at first it lay at the
doorstep, with ripe eyes and noncommittal promises, tiger lilies in
bloom, and a bed of responses. the next day,  meanwhile an automatic
result, of failed to date and a doubt.  this sum up everything, little
by little there were no new stories.  crystallization, rapid movements
and statistics detach themselves and comprised an all inclusive
entertainment system. drudgery was replaced with silent well oiled
steps. one day thoughts occurred, merely not serving a purpose, but
aim, grid and figure of speech. as with any administration life became
a relation to ambience.  the sum was overturned for the good of
influence and a major question. is is was doing,  trees were divided, a
stammering of forgetfulness actually sat down. all the sizes remain
same for all and there was a kind of calm, lucid, and weightlessness of
a drifting light holiday drink and a blue sky formed with words.

(My own little addendum to this cartoon: Eli Lilly (the company that
brought us Prozac) has extensive ties to the Republicans.  E.g., in
1977 when President-to-be George H. W. Bush left the CIA, he was made
director of the company.  Who appointed him?  Dan Quayle's father,
whose family owned a controlling interest in the company.)

Helloooo...

I've arranged a time and place for the "MLA reading" -- Dec. 28th, from
6-11, at the Bowery Poetry Club.  It's a free event, Bob Holman's psyched
about it, and all it seems to be is a matter of getting the poets there and
getting the word out.

BUUUTTTT...

I've got way too much going on this month to organize this event.  Both of
my sisters are moving out of NY to CA in December -- one to SF to follow a
job, the other to LA to follow a lover -- and I really want to have some
good family time with them before they leave.  This was all very sudden.

I also have a dance/poetry performance on Dec. 15th that I'm rehearsing, am
still dealing with Segue aftermath (checks, plain old burnout), a .pdf
series for the ubu site (12 titles!), a job search (-$33 in the bank account
yesterday), etc. - the full plate!

I hate to be a jerk, but I'm just going to drop this entirely, cancel at the
BPC, unless someone just takes over, because I'm at the end of my rope.
Anyone you know who might be interested in arranging this reading?  It
should be pretty easy.

Do it for the Gipper!  Forward this email to your friends if you don't see
them in the cc line.  It should be a great event!  There's also an
honorarium for the MC/organizer from the BPC!

Email me if you're interested...

love and love
Brian

Subject:      Total Information Awareness: Poetry as Chronicle
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="iso-8859-1"

Last night on the local news I saw a three-minute piece on Total Information
Awareness, the project being led by Admiral John Poindexter. As with so many
things that are happening in this lame duck century, it was reported
straight, without inflection or innuendo, not even a raised eyebrow. It was
just, "This is a new program of our government" with a few talking heads
explaining its benefits and -- a bit more vaguely -- its threats to a
democratic republic. Next, sports.

(It later struck me that TIA was being presented *exactly* like the
government recruitment ads in the movie *Starship Troopers* . . . which I
seem to remember Jordan Davis liking).

Such a phenomenon is a staple of Tom Tomorrow cartoons, of course, and I
appreciated Kevin providing the latest example today; other list members
have also mentioned TIA in satirical asides. But no matter how surreal
things get (and Henry Kissinger chairing the September 11 investigative
committee, a war criminal judging a potential war crime, is pretty surreal),
this particular story still has me shaking my head: Admiral Poindexter, a
convicted felon in the Iran-Contra scandal, put in charge of developing a
huge database that would track everything United States citizens do
electronically -- the things we buy, the web sites we click on, the Internet
listservs we participate in, the e-mails we send -- so that any variations
from the norm will be able to be red-flagged, noted, pursued.

*Harpers Weekly* had this comment:

--- In response to a question about Iran-Contra star John Poindexter and his
Total Information Awareness project, Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld
had the following to say: "And then there was the office of strategic
influence. You may recall that. And 'oh my goodness gracious isn't that
terrible, Henny Penny the sky is going to fall.' I went down that next day
and said fine, if you want to savage this thing, fine I'll give you the
corpse. There's the name. You can have the name, but I'm gonna keep doing
every single thing that needs to be done and I have. What was intended to be
done by that office is being done by that office, NOT by that office in
other ways."

The arrogance that only a 65% approval rating can buy. As I said on another
poetics listserv recently, every day it gets a little worse, a little more
terrifying. Has anyone seen the report on the Wellstone plane crash? I
haven't either . . .

Comes now the plaintive cry: what does this have to do with *poetics*? What
does this have to do with *poetry*?

I welcome the prose statements we've seen recently against the forthcoming
hostilities with Iraq, and welcome also Nick Piombino's reflections on
bullies. But all this is "talking about" -- isn't it? Where is the political
art? Where are the imaginative acts of literature that can somehow reflect
the astonishing turn our history has taken in the last few years, a turn
that threatens to lead us away from everything we thought "democracy" meant?

A while back on his blog, Ron Silliman said that he was instantly suspicious
of any poem having a programmatic meaning, a sentiment that many will agree
with. Indeed, abstract and apolitical lyrics flood this listserv, from
Virginia to, well, a rose is a rose. They of course have the assurance that
they won't ever be flagged by TIA monitors.

I can only speak personally, of course, but I don't think I agree with Ron
at all about this one point. We all know examples of clumsy propaganda
(although when it's done well, as in much of Jack Hirshman's and Amiri
Baraka's work, even propaganda has its artistic uses), but what I'm
suspicious of these days is art that's apolitical. I'm looking for
imaginative art that can incorporate some response to -- and even provide a
chronicle of -- this recent chain of terrifying events. I feel that the
poets alive today will eventually be seen as among the most shameful
practitioners of the art if we don't produce such work. I plan to post my
efforts along these lines and hope others will too.

I don't know about the rest of you (who may not get this until Monday) but
I'm looking forward to having a good chaw over the implications and ironies
of the announcement that Dr. K was appointed by a Republican administration
to oversee an investigation into LAPSE IN INTELLIGENCE preceeding 9/11.
Among other things I'm tempted to ask in light of recent posts here
referring to Vietnam is whether his purview includes intelligence lapses
from 1955 to 1980?  these clearly (as far as i can see) happened pre 9/11?

I agree with the desire here. But I'd say be careful to brand the stuff
that doesn't seem to have a political content. The divisions become
poisonous. Politics works in other ways according to individuals'
commitments and abilities. My translations of troubadour poetry (easy
example) might be seen as decadent, in these dark times, but my own
political activities and commitments aren't self-evident in them.

Stephen. You should expand on this with the dry approach and try to get it
published it could lead into some very interesting Satire a la  Swift, and
more contemporary writers: I dont know all of  them but I believe Hunter S
Thompson is good, and there must be some good stuff around (for ideas if you
need them): if it doesnt "change things" such statire is at least very
entertaining: and it makes it harder to take Bush and his friends very
seriously...if you maybe bring in some extra component of some sort of zany
"story"  ... you might want to trace the problem to Pepsi Cola or Ron's
Blogg or G Bowerings Hat or what ever: but I enjoyed this one. If it was
published you might even get payed though! And then you might get included
in Harold Blooms' "CANON" ...but that trerrible fate aside, it has great
possibilities...you could steal some ideas from George Bowering or others on
this list...you might insert Amiri Baraka in there somewhere...I suggest
Harry Nudel as the Crusty Right Wing Book Seller with a heart of gold
(except its radioactive!) and so on...I and some of the "Lefties " could be
the mad paranoids (or models for and so on)...Of course the Mafia would need
to be in ...or is that too obvious? following Burroughs you could "cut in"
some of say...Barret Watten's theoretical writings and get Bush to say them
in a speech. Some of Allen Sondheim's work could be an "Official
Report"...but its your novel...Regards, Richard Taylor.

Hey, has the news about the Prime Minister's aide calling Bush a
"moron" got much press down there? A guy from Bellingham said that
what burned his ass was being required to call that moron a president.

Thanks, Richard. Actually my piece - with the exception of Iraq becoming
Nevada (a state that is half owned by the US Military, home of nuclear and
every other kind of warhead test) is lifted straight from a CNN article on
Iraq inspections.
I was tempted to turn the Inspectors into Poets and expand the sites to
include Casinos
as possible sites to launder money from covert nuclear sales to rogue
states. And, of course, the dark comic possibilities of the military hiding
bombs and biological weapons in highway side trailer bordellos.

Sometimes - cut up or turned up side down - the language of the media is
more than enough.

I suspect like many I am feeling - petitions non-withstanding - scared and
more than a little paralyzed by the momentum of the push to war to occupy
the Middle East - point blank - for oil. Not a good - some might say,
dangerously stupid - cast of cards. Without strong opposition, I am afraid
we are going to be reeling for years.

                                       P=E8lerins were killing the dindes,=
=20
the Peaux-Rouges were killing the P=E8lerins,
                                       and there were several hard winters=
=20
ahead for both of them.

                                       The only way the Peaux- Rouges=20
helped the P=E8lerins was when they taught
                                       them how to grow corn (mais). The=20
reason they did this was because they
                                       liked corn with their P=E8lerins.

                                       In 1623, after another harsh year,=20
the P=E8lerins' crops were so good that they
                                       decided to have a celebration and=20
give thanks because more mais was raised
                                       by the P=E8lerins than P=E8lerins=
 were=20
killed by the Peaux-Rouges.

                                       Every year on le Jour de Merci=20
Donnant, parents tell their children an amusing
                                       story about the first celebration.

                                       It concerns a brave capitaine named=
=20
Miles Standish (known in France as
                                       Kilom=E8tres Deboutish) and a shy=20
young lieutenant named Jean Alden. Both of
                                       them were in love with a flower of=20
Plymouth named Priscilla Mullens (no
                                       translation). The vieux capitaine=20
said to the jeune lieutenant:

                                       "Go to the damsel Priscilla (Allez=20
tr=E8s vite chez Priscilla), the loveliest maiden
                                       of Plymouth (la plus jolie=20
demoiselle de Plymouth). Say that a blunt old
                                       captain, a man not of words but of=20
action (un vieux Fanfan la Tulipe), offers his
                                       hand and his heart - the hand and=20
heart of a soldier. Not in these words, you
                                       understand, but this, in short, is=20
my meaning.

                                       "I am a maker of war (Je suis un=20
fabricant de la guerre) and not a maker of
                                       phrases. You, bred as a scholar=20
(Vous, qui =EAtes pain comme un =E9tudiant),
                                       can say it in elegant language, such=

as you read in your books of the
                                       pleadings and wooings of lovers,=20
such as you think best suited to win the
                                       heart of the maiden."

                                       Although Jean was fit to be tied=20
(convenable =E0 =EAtre emball=E9), friendship
                                       prevailed over love and he went to=20
his duty. But instead of using elegant
                                       language, he blurted out his=20
mission. Priscilla was muted with amazement
                                       and sorrow (rendue muette par=20
l'=E9tonnement et la tristesse).

                                       At length she exclaimed, breaking=20
the ominous silence, "If the great captain of
                                       Plymouth is so very eager to wed me,=
=20
why does he not come himself and
                                       take the trouble to woo me?" (Ou=20

                                       vient-il pas aupr=E8s de moi pour=20

                                       Jean said that Kilom=E8tres Deboutish=
=20
was very busy and didn't have time for
                                       such things. He staggered on,=20
telling her what a wonderful husband
                                       Kilom=E8tres would make.

                                       Finally, Priscilla arched her=20
eyebrows and said in a tremulous voice, "Why
                                       don't you speak for yourself, Jean?"=
=20
(Chacun =E0 son gout.)

                                       And so, on the fourth Thursday in=20
November, American families sit down at a

My apologies to the Buffalo List. I circulated an announcement a few days ago
regarding Steal Something Day. The date was incorrect. Please note that it is
planned for November 29, 2002 not November 24, 2002. Sorry for any

  "If new systems of income distribution continue to permit the professional
bureaucracies to choose when to give and when to withhold financial relief,
the poor will once again be surrendered to an arrangement in which their
rights are diminished in the name of overcoming their vices. Those who lead an
attack on the welfare system must therefore be alert to pitfalls of inadequate
but placating reforms which give the appearance of victory to what is in truth
defeat." - Richard A. Cloward & Frances Fox Piven (1966)










Steal Something Day
November 24, 2002
Participate by participating!
A shameless 24-hour stealing spree!

For the past nine years, a few self-described "culture jammers" from Adbusters
Magazine have dubbed the last Friday in November "Buy Nothing Day."

 From their stylish home base in Vancouver's upscale suburb of Kitsilano, the
Adbusters' brain trust has encouraged conscientious citizens worldwide to
"relish [their] power as a consumer to change the economic environment." In
their words, Buy Nothing Day "[p]roves how empowering it is to step out of the
consumption stream for even a day."

The geniuses at Adbusters have managed to create the perfect feel-good,
liberal, middle-class activist non-happening. A day when the more money you
make, the more influence you have (like every other day). A day which, by
definition, is insulting to the millions of people worldwide who are too poor
or marginalized to be considered "consumers."

It's supposed to be a 24-hour moratorium on spending, but ends up being a
moralistic false-debate about whether or not you should really buy that loaf
of bread today or ... wait for it ... tomorrow!

Well, this year, while the Adbusters cult enjoys yet another Buy Nothing Day,
accompanied by their fancy posters, stickers, TV and radio advertisements and
slick webpages, a few self-described anarcho-situationists from Montreal's
East End are inaugurating Steal Something Day.

Unlike Buy Nothing Day, when people are asked to "participate by not
participating," Steal Something Day demands that we "participate by
participating." Instead of downplaying or ignoring the capitalists, CEOs,
landlords, small business tyrants, bosses, PR hacks, yuppies, media lapdogs,
corporate bureaucrats, politicians and cops who are primarily responsible for
misery and exploitation in this world, Steal Something Day demands that we
steal from them, without discrimination.

The Adbusters' intellegentsia tell us that they're neither "left nor right,"
and have proclaimed a non-ideological crusade against overconsumption. Steal
Something Day, on the other hand, identifies with the historic and
contemporary resistance against the causes of capitalist exploitation, not its
symptoms. If you think overconsumption is scary, wait until you hear about
capitalism and imperialism.

Unlike the misplaced Buy Nothing Day notion of consumer empowerment, Steal
Something Day promotes empowerment by urging us to collectively identify the
greedy bastards who are actually responsible for promoting misery and boredom
in this world. Instead of ignoring them, Steal Something Day encourages us to
make their lives as uncomfortable as possible.

As we like to say in Montreal: dranger les riches dans leurs niches!

And remember, we're talking about stealing, not theft. Stealing is just. Theft
is exploitative. Stealing is when you take a yuppie's BMW for a joyride, and
crash into a parked Mercedes just for the hell of it. Theft is when you take
candy from a baby's mouth. Stealing is the re-distribution of wealth from rich
to poor Theft is making profits at the expense of the disadvantaged and the
natural environment. Stealing is an unwritten a tax on the rich. Theft is
taxing the poor to subsidize the rich. Stealing is nothing more than a tax on
the rich. There is solidarity in stealing, but property is nothing but theft.

So, don't pay for that corporate newspaper, but steal all of them from the
box. Get some friends together and go on a "shoplifting" spree at the local
chain supermarket or upscale mall. With an even larger mob, get together and
steal from the local chain book or record store. Pilfer purses and wallets
from easily identified yuppies and business persons. Skip out on rent. Get a
credit card under a fake name and don't pay. Keep what you can use, and give
away everything else in the spirit of mutual aid that is the hallmark of Steal
Something Day.

Download our detourned poster http://adbusters.tao.ca, make copies and stick
it up wherever you can. And don't forget, send your scamming and stealing tips
to us at lombrenoire@tao.ca.

See you next Steal Something Day which, unlike Buy Nothing Day, happens every
day of the year.

Fleshy Red Thing (a Thanksgiving Poem from Gary & Nada)

Fasten off wattle (using red). Attach red to any head-cluster
insane fasten of secure ends. Make sure wings
hang free so they appear to "flap". Repeat for red wattle:

wrap around your finger to form spirals. Hang snood red
on neck. Cut around red or wattle. To create eyes, draw
a black void on each pom-pom, then cut out all yellow and

glue construction in place.  Perverse people can order
wattle dimsum dumplings in New York's Chinatown.
Uninflate "nose" at one end, then knot off the wattle. To make

turkey talk, cut out a pair of small felt triangles and glue
them to opposite sides. What is the bright red appendage?
Loose changes in your neck can make you look older.

It feels like your ear lobe. Carefully moisten a V-shape
arising from the forehead. Glue on two googly eyes and fill up
with blood. Make the turkey's lungs knot together

in center of folded napkin (do not inflate them).
       You put your whole wattle in
       You put your whole wattle out
       You put your whole wattle in
       And you shake it all about.

I don't dare write a truthful personal ad: "Enlarged pores, dozens
of new age spots, emergent wattle. Boop-bleep-boop-
whooo-blip I’m Ronald Reagan. I'm ... mind?" As in mammals,

birds have a four-chambered heart; however,
a Turkey's heart is proportionately larger and more powerful.

EMILY O'HARA

Because I cannot stop for lunch --
LeRoi kindly stops for me  --
I'm hung-over, take an Alka-Seltzer  --
Which makes me have to pee.

We slowly stroll --  LeRoi langorously agitates
And I seem to have puked away
My early morning bagel and my coffee too,
But gracefully  --

We pass the Cedar, where Pollock's frame
Recesses--when he's not "in the ring"  --
We pass a young Marjorie Perloff
Such a serious look for a young girl's face --

Or rather--she passes us--or anyway will--
Mountain Dew hasn't been invented yet  --
There's only Coca-Cola, and perhaps
Fanta? -- although I'm no authority  --

We pause before a construction site that seems
To swell up from the ground --
The roof of LeRoi's mouth is suddenly visible --
His crowns --

Cut to -- decades later -- I'm dead
And now LeRoi's fully Amiri --
And I guess people are fairly upset
About that poem of his post-WTC -- ?

The trees,  who have inexplicably decided that nudity
serves the cold, wash over the blacktop in a spill of
tawny veins. November spins frost where once moods
pooled. In a loop a sky failing nothing but this death
of autumn on pavement and traffic  sands falls through
each phase in a blink that stutters.  She wants warm
cooking to ease the chill from her hands. The burden
of mothers sums all familial marks in the arc of her
loving the kitchen with thankful motion. As male, I
wash in the lighter stones of strange birds calling my
eyes glued shut to a physics of remorse.  This season
is good for stripping.

It appears in a piece by Peter Gizzi, and then reappears in a piece by somebody
else -- I think Lehman -- but I don't have any of my books with me and so can't
give citations --

Hi Kevin,

I think its been used a bit, but don't let that stop you. I found this at
http://www.flyinghorse-ucf.org/newsletter.html

      Sharon Mesmer

      and

      David Humphrey

      In collaboration for a second time, this team is working on Lonely
Tylenol. David Humphrey's lyrical line and Sharon Mesmer's fast-punch
elegant prose are sure to be a dynamic work of art.

      David Humphrey is the 2002 recipient of the Guggenheim Award for
Visual Art.

      Sharon Mesmer is the 1999 recipient of the New York Foundation for the
Arts Grant
      in Poetry

      Lonely Tylenol currently in production and is scheduled to be
published in late fall 2002. Look forward to seeing this project!

      For more information on David Humphrey visit the McKee Gallery web
site. Some other Humphrey links include Drunken Boat and Solomon Project
(click on "artists" to find out about David's new exhibiting.)

      Read some thoughts about Sharon Mesmer's book Half Angel, Half Lunch
on Culture Port's web site.

Yes

Stone head, deaf to onion finger wounds, peel the
moisture from models of political ports. Your eyes
sink deeper in your head as light like a fist
spellchecks moments in which the cold pills palsy
saccharine speeds that betray burnt hungers of sienna
lapse.

        Stone head, I'll pick you up at the airport. force
onions into your fingers to  lie to the dead. In order
to better focus on November, the cold pills lyricize
teeth like the worst of all possible headaches.
Shimmied to an artery deep in stone, you'll watch
everything behind you slip liquid reflections over the
screen from which you feed, a network (a curt curl of
algae, algorithmic syncopation), or through which your
freezing glides like glassy bulbs on thin rope
workspace. I like the ugly boots you've flung upon the
chair.

        Stone ends of live webs, when I flinch from
recollection of unsatisfying girls ripped around
falsifying hymns with steganographic innaccuracies of
gaze, a sallow prayer reaches out for me. You. who are
balanced by your lust for typing, grow positively
ludic in charred chat response. I  love everything
that could go wrong.

Emily O'Hara is pretty funny.  The first line reminded me of TS Eliot
-  something about "turning"?

Parenthetically I had a brief stint between jobs in "branding" or "naming."
I remember one job - about 1998 - was to come up with a name for a new
Monsanto company that would produce genetically modified products(corn,
cotton etc.)!  I had some instinct that a poet might be perfect for creating
Corporate logos and such. It turned out I was not good. Ironic and satirical
impulses kept getting in the way. My sense of the people who were good at
branding were also good at scrabble and crossword puzzles, and they seemed
value neutral when they got into the imaginative plough of the name
inventing process.  In 1998, remember, so many businesses were being
established, finding a unique name/brand/logo reflective of the content of
the business was a major problem, an issue of scarcity and a source of big
bucks for "naming" companies. (Not a problem today - you can pick up names
for practically nothing from all those businesses that have gone under.)
I do remember, however, that one of the ploys of finding a new name was the
use of palindromes, or just spelling words backwards, or ones that end in a
vowel as a means to find some unique sounding combination of syllables. I
suspect the folks who came up with Tylenol started with "lonely" backwards
and added the "t".  (As I write this, it's suddenly a curious question, that
is what is the conceptual difference between being "lonely backwards", and
"lonely forwards"?)

O well, happy thanksgivings.

branding were also good at scrabble and crossword puzzles, and they seemed
value neutral when they got into the imaginative plough of the name
inventing process.  In 1998, remember, so many businesses were being
established, finding a unique name/brand/logo reflective of the content of
the business was a major problem, an issue of scarcity and a source of big
bucks for "naming" companies. (Not a problem today - you can pick up names
for practically nothing from all those businesses that have gone under.)
I do remember, however, that one of the ploys of finding a new name was the
use of palindromes, or just spelling words backwards, or ones that end in a
vowel as a means to find some unique sounding combination of syllables. I
suspect the folks who came up with Tylenol started with "lonely" backwards
and added the "t".  (As I write this, it's suddenly a curious question, that
is what is the conceptual difference between being "lonely backwards", and
"lonely forwards"?)

O well, happy thanksgivings.

SPIRAL STARES


Sleep siren, spiral starist * Clouds as I knew writing is a strangeness * Waking in two waters, being you, being both * Liquid, is to verb, is motion, spends days staring * Silence travels up the spine & into the brain * There is the sun itself equal to zero, I find hair everywhere * Endeavor of light, light as endeavor * Sent, the first sense organ is here unwritten * To leap is a product of sitting * One thought glued to another, a daisy chained * Simon, the most famous of the pillar hermits * A moment, but more like moving, moved, mauve * Language is touching, is the skinny transcriber * Fastened by string, telepathy swings in the throat * These unrestrained horses in the face of it * Light between us makes a solid where there was none * There is danger in the frequencies themselves, the whitest of noise * Staring, blinking, sleeping, cats caught in mid air * The pelting of clouds equal to the eyes in a purple crush * The passage is a boat of monkey-logic, a mountain of fo
 am * Meaning swirls in the folds of a smothered point * In the center where to turn yellow is to disappear * The sky is an opening to graze on shoulders so near the head * Up to the last minute...there will be a great worship of animals * Speak swell, speaks well, peaks well, swell speaks, peak speech * From everything ripples outward above our daily ness * The anticipation of what you do happens and into what you do we * Language at a standstill is in flux * Grows toward declaring the body as fuel for the sun to persist * Particles accumulate inside this bag are what matter * Darling lower lip, darling the warm landing * Enough will satisfy to barter vision * The bean snug airless, the bean disrobing, exploding

AIBOHPHOBIA

_a play by Nada & Gary_

[Scene: Bob & Anna, 2002.]

BOB:    Yo!

ANNA: Oy. So many dynamos.

BOB: Too hot to hoot. Sniff’um muffins!

ANNA: Yo! Banana Boy. Yawn a more Roman way.

BOB: Timid? I’m it. Snug & raw was I ere I saw war & guns.

ANNA: So many dynamos.

BOB: Was it a bat I saw? Was it a bar or a bat I saw. Was it a cat I saw?
Was it a car or a cat I saw. Was it a rat I saw? Was it Eliot’s toilet I
saw…?

ANNA: T. Eliot nixes sex in toilet. T. Eliot, top bard, notes putrid tang
emanating, is sad, I’d assign it a name: gnat dirt upset on drab pot toilet.
Sex-aware era waxes. Sexes. Is sensuousness I?

BOB: Sore was I ere I saw Eros.

ANNA: No, son! Onanism’s a gross orgasm sin—a no-no, son! Lay a wallaby baby
ball away, Al. Strap on no parts. Model truth: turtledom.

BOB: A dank, sad nap. On a clover, if alive, erupts a vast, pure evil. A
fire volcano. Eels sleep and ask Nada.

ANNA: Go, desire vagina. Man I gave. Rise dog.

BOB: Aha! A dog! A panic in a pagoda! I’m alas, a salami.

ANNA: I, Mary, tramp martyr. Am I?

BOB: No pet so tragic as a cigar to step on.

ANNA: UFO tofu.

BOB: Gnu dung.

ANNA: Evil olive.

BOB: Lonely Tylenol.

ANNA: Paganini, din in a gap.

BOB: Emu fat sap pasta fume.

ANNA: Drab as a fool, aloof as a bard. Drab bard.

BOB: O, Geronimo, no minor ego.

ANNA: No, it is opposition.

BOB: Roy, am I mayor?

ANNA: Wo Nemo, toss a lasso to me now. May a moody baby doom a yam? May it
name ‘em anti-yam?

BOB: Do geese see god? God, a red nugget, a fat egg under a dog.

ANNA: Dog as a devil deified, lived as a devil.

BOB: Dogma? I am god! Don’t nod. I, madam, I made radio. So I dared. Am I
mad? Am I?

ANNA: O, I dare not tone radio. Live not on evil. Ed is on no side. Let
O’Hara gain an inn in a Niagra hotel.

BOB: Sup not on pus, tangy gnat. Are we not drawn onward, to new era?

BOB and ANNA: Are we not drawn onward, we few, drawn onward to new era …?

The Banner Art Collective's Buy Nothing Day contest received 15
banners from artists in France, the UK, and the US. Thanks to all
artists for a great and varied group of entries.

Many entries were strong, so contest officials almost decided to
split the grand prize of $0 (USD) between several entries.
Ultimately, though, the grand prize was awarded to Zebra3's
"buy-sell(f) nothing," a banner which subverts the textuality of
corporate logos to good effect.  Zebra3's banner will be featured on
the Banner Art Collective's front page (http://www.bannerart.org/)
through the holiday buying season.

Buy Nothing Day (November 29th in the US and Canada, November 30th in
Europe and elsewhere) is an annual international event held to
protest the unoffical opening day of holiday shopping.  It is
organized by the Adbusters Media Foundation
(http://www.adbusters.org/). Now in its eleventh year, Buy Nothing
Day is a 24-hour consumer fast and celebration of sustainable living.
Over one million people around the world are expected to participate.

As always, the Banner Art Collective (http://www.bannerart.org/)
continues to collect new entries for its ongoing banner art
collection.  From November 29 through February 9, the site will be
included in the Edith-Russ Site for Media Art exhibition "Total
=DCberzogen" (http://www.oldenburg.de/edith-russ-haus/) in Oldenburg,
Germany.  The group plans to stage several banner art "happenings"
within commercial advertising space in early 2003.

Does anyone know of an online resource that gives book sales statistics per
title or ISBN?  I seem to remember something like this on Amazon, but that
might relate only to sales through Amazon itself.

If anyone knows of such a resource, please backchannel-- aaron@belz.net

can be vanquished. Even Freud, you might remember, at one point viewed
death as not necessarily inevitable."
--Eugene Gendlin, philosopher and psychotherapist, founder of The
Focusing Institute

"This book--I am completely knocked out by it."-Aaron Kunin, poet and
novelist, Johns Hopkins University.

"Together with Norberg-Schulz's Intentions in Architecture and Venturi's
Complexity and Contradiction in Architecture, this work should be
counted among the handful of seminal and iconoclastic contemporary
studies that open up and redefine the field of architecture."-Andrew
MacNair, architect, Columbia University.

"A poetic-philosophical masterpiece. A moral, anti-metaphysical
illumination. Gins and Arakawa have extended Spinoza's insight that the
body has no limits to emerge with a maximal architecture, an
architecture in the visionary mode of Hejduk, Taut, and Schwitters.
Their radical housing project is a severe polemic against the elegiac
Western tradition and its memorials. In an anti-Virgilian mode in which
everything immortal touches the mind, they propose exigent structures
against death."-David Shapiro, art historian, poet, and author of
Lateness, Cooper Union.

"From Plato to Heidegger, from an architectonics of the cosmic demiurge
to a post-metaphysical analysis of building, dwelling, and thinking,
architecture has been conceived as housing for those who die. Arakawa
and Gins ask the question, why not construct for those who will continue
to live? This is the manifesto of a transhuman architecture, a call for
a daring, practical, fully embodied art of living."-Gary Shapiro,
philosopher and author of Archaeologies of Vision: Foucault and
Nietzsche on Seeing and Saying, University of Richmond.

"The first 21st century reconception of human life . . . [and] a program
of expanding human potential on a scale not seen since the
Enlightenment."-Stanley Shostak, biologist and author of Becoming
Immortal, University of Pittsburgh.

"The world may not be precisely ready for this, but these propitious
blueprints are absolutely necessary."-Lissa Wolsak, poet, metal smith,
and author of Pen Chants.

Architectural Body

Madeline Gins and Arakawa

The authors urge critical theorists of all stripes to consider taking
nothing less than the architectural body (body-proper plus architectural
surround) as the basic unit for study.

This revolutionary work by artist-architects Arakawa and Madeline Gins
demonstrates the inter-connectedness of innovative architectural design,
the poetic process, and philosophical inquiry. Together, they have
created an experimental and widely admired body of work--museum
installations, landscape and park commissions, home and office designs,
avant-garde films, poetry collections--that challenges traditional
notions about the built environment.

In 1997 the Guggenheim Museum presented an Arakawa/Gins retrospective
and published a comprehensive volume of their work titled Reversible
Destiny: We Have Decided Not to Die. Architectural Body continues the
philosophical definition of that project and demands a fundamental
rethinking of the terms "human" and "being." When organisms assume full
responsibility for inventing themselves, where they live and how they
live will merge. The artists believe that a thorough re-visioning of
architecture will redefine life and its limitations and render death
pass=E9. The authors explain that "Another way to read reversible destiny
. . . is as an open challenge to our species to reinvent itself and to
desist from foreclosing on any possibility."

"This is a strong and important work, as much for its polemic and
contentious claims as for its utopian inflections."
--Steve McCaffery, poet and Director of the North American Centre for
Interdisciplinary Poetics

Arakawa is an architect and artist, and Madeline Gins is an architect,

What humorous writers, who write nothing but humor, are studied in college

I studied both Roth and Heller in college, as well as E.B. White. All three funny, depending on how willing you were to be amused. Canonical? Well, pretty much.

Little tiny memories with no theorizing are all right, I hope. I have
a fond memory of Ted at my apartment in Montreal over 30 years ago.
He has got big and he has a big beard and a checked logger's (I think
you NZ-Brits-Easterners say Lumberjack) shirt and suspenders, and my
wife Angela just loved him, she from a logging town and logging
family, and a great reader of poetry. When we played one of my Velvet
Underground records Ted went and turned the volume up to 10, Soon the
guy from the apartment upstairs came down and said his windows were
shaking. Angela loved the picture we had of her giving Ted as big a
hug as she could.

What's a "pure humorist"? Is Mark Twain one? Is Charles Bernstein a
humorist (among a lot of other things)? Why would you want a humorist to
be "pure"?

The Vancouver coordinating chapter of Steal Something Day would like to thank
all participants for a great and varied group of stealings. Many of our
stealers, however, were busted hard by the pigs. T was taken down at a Home
Depot in the suburbs and will spend two days in jail deprived of his
methadone. G almost made it out of a Safeway with groceries to feed his peeps
for the evening but a savvy pig in the parking lot recognized him from a
previous encounter. Q stole a half a dozen disposable cameras from a drug
store without incident but returned later in the day for another seven, to
bring the total to a nice baker's dozen, but he was busted by undercovers and
driven to the city limits for the "special processing" usually invoked only in
the case of aboriginals.

Aaron, it rather begs the question of what is humor, doesn't it? I mean, I
 think immediately of Wallace Stevens, Samuel Beckett, Flann O'Brien (surely
the latter of the three was almost exclusively a humorist), but then I think
that though the first two are almost exclusively comic, even in their darkest
works, one couldn't necessarily label them humorists. Humorist seems to be a
term that arises out of a journalistic milieu, almost of E. B. White's era. Be
that as it may, I find almost all of Gertrude Stein's work profoundly funny --
even her more "serious" stuff. Ogden Nash, Lewis Carroll, Edward Lear -- almost
all exclusively haha. I'm away from my office and books, but if I weren't by
gawd this screen would be snowing darkly with names.

 In fact, I'd be hardpressed to find something from the corpus of all avant
 garde writers that wasn't comic. Vanguard writers, that is, employ the comic
as a fierce and disruptive tactic. This is because transgression of social and
aesthetic norms is almost always going to be comic at some level, isn't it. The
comic is not in itself haha; it is transgression (which is the heart of comedy)
that is the haha.

 But I think that "humor" is not the same as the comic. Giordano Bruno's famous
 tag, in hilaritas tristis, in tristia hilaris, kind of blows the
humor/gravitas binary out of the water in a rather succinct, if overly
apodictic, way.

Hey all,

I've found this list to be a consistently rewarding experience, though I've
remained largely a silent participant.  I wanted to pick up the thread spun
out and cat's-cradled by Taylor, Watten, Piombino, Vincent, and others
regarding our various "positions" on the impending war on Iraq.  Thanks to all
of you for worrying over this thread; it gives me a bit of hope that poets do
have something to say/do in the national and world agenda.  Having worked for
a number of years on the anti-sanctions campaign in Iraq, I can only say that,
among progressive political movements, among the most difficult are those that
attempt to intervene in foreign policy decisions, because they seem most
distant to regular Americans (who fail to see the thousand ways that their
lives are most deeply interconnected with those abroad) and because foreign
policy decisions are the least democratic of all political decisions.

However, these facts do not--and should not--absolve us from intervening in
whatever ways possible, into that discussion.  Certainly every jackass who
sucked Nixon's teat feels the god-given right to do so on national television.
 I guess I have been a little disappointed that, on the list most associated
with experimental/avant-garde poetics, we have not given much theory nor
demonstrated (at least by virtue of our postings), how in fact we can begin to
intervene in the discussions about this impending war.  When Steve Taylor
suggests that he hasn't heard much noise from "the anti-war movement," I would
like to suggest to Steve, YOU ARE THE ANTI-WAR MOVEMENT.  It is time we made
some noise.  Of course those who for years have carried the peace torch have
done much organizing over this issue, of course there have been demonstrations
and protests, of course Marin County artists have turned their naked bodies
into PEACE, of course all of this has happened.  The impression that the
anti-war movement is silent is brought to you by CNN, who always represents
anti-war protest as a foreign phenomenon, in which illegible or untranslated
signs (quite literally) suggest the illegibility of the antiwar
counterdiscourse itself.

We need a panoply of poetic and political strategies to figure out ways to
render that illegibility more legible.  I'm heartened by Taylor's downunder
provocations, Watten's consistently oppositional voice (see Bad History), but
I'm a little surprised we haven't heard much from others.  I don't expect that
everyone agree with an oppositional position vis-a-vis the "war on/of terror",
but I sort of demand an explanation for our quietism.  This war is tearing my
insides out.  Hundreds of thousands died in the last war, to protect an
undemocratic oil fiefdom.  What will happen this time?

Thanks to all the people who have bent my brains on this list: the
abovementioned, as well as shout-outs to Mike Magee--I taught your "Political
Song/Confused Voicing" for an hour last week, and my students really dug it;
Anselm Berrigan (nice to know there's another Pavement-head out there);
Patrick Herron, for the posting about the antiwar anthology, thanks man; Maria
Damon, love your work on poetry!; and countless others whose names I can't
remember now who have been working it.

Peace out, Phil Metres

>Inspectors are preparing to use state-of-the-art equipment when they begin

>Inspectors believe Pentagon officials may smuggle documents or evidence out

>weapons, and 6 from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) who will
>investigate any nuclear weapons capability.
>
>Demetrius Perricos, head of the atomic team, told reporters Tuesday that

>
>"You can enter a room which is empty, but that room might have a history and
>only if you are taking samples or doing some measurements you can find out

>
>Inspectors have showed reporters some of the high-tech equipment they will
>use -- including devices that allow for rapid detection of the presence of
>chemical, biological, or nuclear substances that may indicate a facility has
>been used for developing weapons capability.
>
>Inspectors will take air samples and "swipes" of objects within a site, as
>well as other types of samples, and examine them for things such as
>radioactive isotopes. They will also seal up some objects.
>
>Information will be sent immediately to laboratories in Moscow and Vienna.
>
>Information collected from the inspections will be cross-referenced against
>files showing what substances should be present given the site's official
>purpose.
>
>"Technology of today is having much progress in terms of what it provides
>for a rapid detection of biological or chemical substances," Perricos said.
>
>Pointing to the relatively small size of the detection devices, he said:
>"Thank God they made it portable and not just transportable."
>
>Perricos was asked whether the arms monitors would be looking for suspected

Subject:      Humorism
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; format=flowed

Maybe what Aaron means by pure humorist is a professional humorist, someone
with a regular humor-writing gig or someone who freelances humor pieces
regularly ... in other words, Robert Benchley, Fran Liebowitz, James
Thurber, P.J. O’Rourke. It might not be helpful or illuminating, but I do
think there's a distinction between these writers and, say, Laurence Stern,
or Charles Bernstein. Charles once wrote or said that he would never
sacrifice whatever he was doing formally (artistically?) for a joke, and I
think he was making a distinction between what he was doing (poetry) from
some idea of "humor" or a "humorist"; and though I think humorists pretty
much feel the same way (it's not that Veronica Geng ever sacrificed anything
for a joke, her writing was very "artful"), I do think there’s a difference
of sensibility, ambition, and/or intention between, like, Bob Perelman and
S.J. Perelman. I wouldn't quite know how to describe it, though. Like, I
don't think it's quite so simple as that Bob is consciously writing for some
higher whatever and S.J. Pereleman just assumed what he did to be literary
chopped liver written for laffs.

Anyway, the total joke sacrifice seems more like something a stand-up
comedian would (necessarily) do ... and I’d also make a distinction between
humorists and stand-up comedians; although, for instance, Woody Allen
started as a stand-up comedian, then became a humorist (successfully
recycling the kinds of moves Benchley had made decades before him), and then
a filmmaker.

I think of Bob and Ray as humorists and Monty Python as a comedy troupe and
the Firesign Theater as satirists. I mean, when I’m in a distinction-making
mood. Firesign Theater being very much of their time and medium; Monty
Python being very much of their medium; and Bob and Ray being ... well, Bob
and Ray. They don't seem to have aged in the same way that Firesign Theater
(who I still love) did. Monty Python worked very well on TV but not so well
in the movies--although most people would probably disagree with me on that
one. But Bob and Ray I think work equally well on the radio, on TV, on the
page. (Although, obviously, part of the Bob and Ray thing is that they never
tried to make their female or child voices sound like women or children.) I
think less people know about Bob and Ray than Monty Python or Firesign
Theater. Or, maybe that's just my sense.

My favorite humorist, "pure" humorist, was Miles na gCopaleen. I think it’s
even fair to call him a pure humorist, even though he (Brian O’Nolan) wrote
quote serious unquote novels under his other pseudonym, Flann O’Brien. But,
his column for the Irish Times was definitely a "pure humorist" column if
ever there was one. A good example maybe was his often revisted "Catechism
of Cliche": "What does pandemonium do? It breaks loose. Describe its
subsequent dominion. It reigns." etc.

My favorite stuff of his was this kind of social criticism he'd do, always
about the Irish (naturally):

from ST. PATRICK'S DAY

SIGNAL BOX SCENE: Jimmy is sitting down, engrossed in a newspaper. Ignatius
is lolling on another chair, smoking. Jimmy shakes head and gestures at
paper. He looks up, frowning.

JIMMY: Yiss. Saint Patrick's Day. Dya know, we might all be makin a mistake,
a HIDYUS mistake. The brother says there was never anny such man as Saint
Patrick.

IGNATIUS:Ah come here now, Jimmy, the national Apostle. That's no sort of
talk to be givin out of you.

JIMMY: I'm oney tellin ya what the brother says. So far as I'm consairned, I
have always been all FOR St. Patrick's Day. I think I've seen more Patrick's
Dayu processions than anny man alive. What am I talkin about--didn't I walk
in TWO of them. Th'oul fella was an Irish Forester with a green clawhammer
on him and in nineteen and O twelve he med me step out in the brigade of the
Glasnevin Branch of the Gaelic League with A KILT ON ME, man yiss, and a
pipe band in front of us playing the Rakes of Malla.

IGN: That must have ben a great sight--yerself in kilts and a plaad over yer
shoulder and the big knobbly knees on full display for all to see.

JIMMY: Oh now I looked damm well in them days. But th'oul fella would do yer
heart good. There was no half measure there. He was a Forester, a
Parnelite,a Votes-for Wimmin man, a Larkinite and a Gaelic Leaguer. ...

Etc., etc. (see http://www.ncf.carleton.ca/~bj333/HomePage.flann.html for
the rest of this "play")

I actually used to love the fact that humorists weren’t canonized, that you
had to find out about them on your own, in used bookstores, usually. (No
longer true for na cGopaleen, who Dalkey Archive, named after one of
O'Brien's novels, has put back into print in the U.S.) "Discovering" a book
by Veronica Geng in Green Apple on Clement Street, S.F., in 1986 or 87, was
totally thrilling. (I admittedly don’t get out much.) And even moreso, all
of those old Robert Benchley hardcovers (My Ten Years in a Quandry, etc.),
which even in the 80s were going for $20-$30, a huge sum for a guy washing
dishes and prepping restaurant food for living. I remember being saddened
when I read that Geng had died, not long after I moved to NYC. There wasn't
really anyone to talk to about that, because no one I knew knew who she was.
She’d been fired from the New Yorker back in the early nineties after Tina
Brown took over, and it seemed like she just disappeared.

Gary,

I was thinking about humor the way you are.  Yes, there's a comic element
that shoots through all writing, in some way or other--as in Dickens, which
has a great deal of comedy, or in say Allen Ginsberg, who has his schtick,
or even Wallace Stevens, who is definitely funny. Russell Edson is funny in
an unnerving way I admire.

I'm not thinking about these kind of writers, who *incorporate* the comic
element, but those who specialize in it.  Writers who are out for a laugh
and little more.  Not even really satirists who have a political or social
objective, but jokesters, comedians, of a more domestic variety.  Dave
Barry. Woody Allen's "Without Feathers" etc. Bob & Ray, yes.  James
Thurber. Ogden Nash. Twain's friends: Nasby, Billings, Ward of the lecture
circuit.  I don't know historical literature well enough to follow the
trail back any further.

My observation is that jokers are pretty much sidelined when it comes to
literary history or school studies.  They tend to be relegated to history
in some way-- sociological history, cultural studies, etc.  But a writer
like Mark Twain gets plucked from history and studied in high school
English, because he's a "serious" writer.  Here's a quotation from an
article in the Nov 18, 1917 New York Times:

"Those belated readers who may even now think of Mark Twain as a mere
fun-maker, to be classed carelessly with John Phoenix and Artemus Ward and
Josh Billings, will find in these letters cause to revise hasty judgment
and to recognize the depth and nobility of Mark Twain's nature. A humorist
he was from the beginning to the end; but at the end humor was no longer
the dominant element in his work. He made men laugh as no one else was able
to do so abundantly in the final twoscore years of the nineteenth century;
but his laughter was never forced or trivial or accidental. His humor was
rooted in and flowered out of a deep and abiding melancholy; and at the end
of his life he was as serious and as sad at heart as Swift or Cervantes or
Moliere. His tenderness is beautifully displayed in the letters to his
wife, of which Mr. Paine allows us to read only a few, simple and sincere
in their direct expression of a love which began at first sight and which
grew steadily with the years."


I think there's something in our very notion of "literature" that excludes
jokes, burlesques, comical sketch writing.   Or is it that humor is too
closely connected with immediate experience -- temporal manifestation of
human culture-- so that over time it expires?  It's not funny any more?
Maybe joking grows stale?

Will there be a future culture who will not laugh at Monty Python?  Or
perhaps not laugh as hard as we do?


Yours without a struggle,
Aaron

Let's all sound smart, shall we?  I mean, let's be reasonable.  Shall we?

No such thing as a conspiracy.  I mean, no reason in any suggestion of a
conspiracy.  I'm too educated to buy any of those paranoid conspiracy
theories.

For example, Enron was purely a series of cloying plodding accidents.  Let's
keep this all in moderation.

So too is Kissinger's appointment to the 9/11 probe.  To suggest otherwise
would merely be self-indulgent.

Allende anyone?  http://cryptome.org/chile-plot.htm  Let's maintain a sense
of
proportion.  Follow the yellow brick road. Follow.  Follow.  Follow.
Follow.

Not evidence of a conspiracy: just a series of well-meaning gestures that
accidentally appear to look like a conspiracy, but of course appearing as
such
only to those paranoid types.

Just a conincidence: no extradition to Chile, and now this new job.  Purely
coincidence, Henry.  Let us please remain reasonable.  No such thing as a
conspiracy.

Silly conspiracy-minded people.  Obviously you conspiracy-minded paranoiacs
should just stick to X-Files.  Silly fools.

No such thing as a conspiracy.  We decent sane smart people all know that.

Here's a typically bombastic essay by Mencken on humor, "our national
literature," and Mark Twain's relationship to these things.

One thing he doesn't mention is the role of the "pure humorist" in literary
history.  I'm interested to know the fate of humorists who never really
lapse into a serious mode--whether they last, or fade away with yesterday's
headlines.

The Burden of Humor
By H. L. Mencken
The Smart Set 38 (Feb. 1913).

---------------------------------------------------------------------

What is the origin of the prejudice against humor? Why is it so dangerous,
if you would keep the public confidence, to make the public laugh?

Is it because humor and sound sense are essentially antagonistic? Has
humanity found by experience that the man who sees the fun of life is
unfitted to deal sanely with its problems? I think not. No man had more of
the comic spirit in him than William Shakespeare, and yet his serious
reflections, by the sheer force of their sublime obviousness, have pushed
their way into the race's arsenal of immortal platitudes. So, too, with
Aesop, and with Lincoln and Johnson, to come down the scale. All of these
men were humorists, and yet all of them performed prodigies of indubitable
wisdom. And contrariwise, many an undeniable pundit has had his guffaw.
Huxley, if he had not been the greatest intellectual duellist of his age,
might have been its greatest wit. And Beethoven, after soaring to the
heights of tragedy in the first movement of the Fifth Symphony, turned to
the divine fooling, the irresistible bull-fiddling of the scherzo.

No, there is not the slightest disharmony between sense and humor and
respectability, despite the almost universal tendency to assume that there
is. But, why, then, that widespread error? What actual fact of life lies
behind it, giving it a specious appearance of reasonableness? None other, I
am convinced, than the fact that the average man is far too stupid to make
a joke.

He may see a joke and love a joke, particularly when it floors and
flabbergasts some person he dislikes, but the only way he can himself take
part in the priming and pointing of a new one is by acting as its target.
In brief, his personal contact with humor tends to fill him with an
accumulated sense of disadvantage, of pricked complacency, of sudden and
crushing defeat; and so, by an easy psychological process, he is led into
the idea that the thing itself is incompatible with true dignity of
character and intellect. Hence his deep suspicion of jokers, however their
thrusts. "What a damphool!" -- this same half-pitying tribute he pays to
wit and butt alike. He cannot separate the virtuoso of comedy from his
general concept of comedy itself, and that concept is inextricably mixed
with memories of foul ambuscades and mortifying hurts. And so it is not
often that he is willing to admit any wisdom in a humorist, or to condone
frivolity in a sage.

In all this, I believe, there is a plausible explanation of the popular,
and even of the critical attitude toward the late Samuel Langhorne Clemens
(Mark Twain). Unless I am so wholly mistaken that my only expiation lies in
suicide, Mark was the noblest literary artist who ever set pen to paper on
American soil, and not only the noblest artist, but also one of the most
profound and sagacious philosophers. From the beginning of his maturity
down to his old age he dealt constantly and earnestly with the deepest
problems of life and living, and to his consideration of them he brought a
truly amazing instinct for the truth, an almost uncanny talent for ridding
the essential thing of its deceptive husks of tradition, prejudice, flubdub
and balderdash. No man, not even Nietzsche, ever did greater execution
against those puerilities of fancy which so many men mistake for religion,
and over which they are so eager to dispute and break heads. No man had a
keener eye for that element of pretense which is bound to intrude itself
into all human thinking, however serious, however painstaking, however
honest in intent. And yet, because the man had humor as well as acumen,
because he laughed at human weakness instead of weeping over it, because he
turned now and then from the riddle of life to the joy of life -- because
of this habit of mind it is the custom to regard him lightly and somewhat
apologetically, as one debarred from greatness by unfortunate infirmities.

William Dean Howells probably knew him better than any other human being,
but in all that Howells has written about him one is conscious of a
conditioned admiration, of a subtle fear of allowing him too much merit, of
an ineradicable disinclination to take him quite seriously. The Mark that
Howells draws is not so much a great artist as a glorious enfant terrible.
And even William Lyon Phelps, a hospitable and penetrating critic, wholly
loose of orthodox shackles -- even Phelps hems and haws a bit before
putting Mark above Oliver Wendell Holmes, and is still convinced that "The
Scarlet Letter" is an incomparably finer work of art than "Huckleberry
Finn."

Well, such notions will die hard, but soon or late, I am sure, they will
inevitably die. So certain am I, indeed, of their dying that I now formally
announce their death in advance, and prepare to wait in patience for the
delayed applause. In one of his essays Dr. Phelps shows how critical
opinion of Mark has gradually evolved from scorn into indifference, and
from indifference into toleration, and from toleration into apologetic
praise, and from apologetic praise into hearty praise. The stage of
unqualified enthusiasm is coming -- it has already cast its lights before
England -- and I am very glad to join the lodge as a charter member. Let me
now set down my faith, for the literary archeologists of day after
tomorrow:

I believe that "Huckleberry Finn" is one of the great masterpieces of the
world, that it is the full equal of "Don Quixote" and "Robinson Crusoe,"
that it is vastly better than "Gil Blas," "Tristram Shandy," "Nicholas
Nickleby" or "Tom Jones." I believe that it will be read by human beings of
all ages, not as a solemn duty but for the honest love of it, and over and
over again, long after every book written in America between the years 1800
and 1860, with perhaps three exceptions, has disappeared entirely save as a
classroom fossil. I believe that Mark Twain had a clearer vision of life,
that he came nearer to its elementals and was less deceived by its false
appearances, than any other American who has ever presumed to manufacture
generalizations, not excepting Emerson. I believe that, admitting all his
defects, he wrote better English, in the sense of cleaner, straighter,
vivider, saner English, than either Irving or Hawthorne. I believe that
four of his books -- "Huck," "Life on the Mississippi," "Captain
Stormfield's Visit to Heaven," and "A Connecticut Yankee" -- are alone
worth more, as works of art and as criticisms of life, than the whole
output of Cooper, Irving, Holmes, Mitchell, Stedman, Whittier and Bryant. I
believe that he ranks well above Whitman and certainly not below Poe. I
believe that he was the true father of our national literature, the first
genuinely American artist of the blood royal.

Such is my feeling at the moment, and such has been my feeling for many a
moon. If any gentleman in the audience shares it, either wholly or with
qualifications, then I advise him to buy and read the biography of Mark
lately published by Albert Bigelow Paine (Harper), for therein he will find
an elaborate, painstaking and immensely interesting portrait of the man,
and sundry shrewd observations upon the writer.

Not that I agree with Paine in all his judgments. Far from it, indeed. It
seems to me that he gets bogged hopelessly when he tries to prove that "The
Innocents Abroad" is a better book than "A Tramp Abroad," that he commits a
crime when he puts "Joan of Arc" above "Huck Finn," and that he is too
willing to join Howells and other such literary sacristans in frowning down
upon Mark's clowning, his weakness for vulgarity, his irrepressible
maleness. In brief, Paine is disposed, at times, to yield to current
critical opinion against what must be his own good sense. But when you have
allowed for all this -- and it is not obtrusive -- the thing that remains
is a vivid and sympathetic biography, a book with sound merit in every
chapter of it, a mountain of difficulties triumphantly surmounted, a fluent
and excellent piece of writing. Paine tells everything that is worth
hearing, whether favorable to Mark or the reverse, and leaves out all that
is not worth hearing. One closes the third volume with unbounded admiration
for the industry of the biographer, and with no less admiration for his
frankness and sagacity. He has given us a rich and colorful book,
presenting coherently a wise selection from a perfect chaos of materials.
The Mark Twain that emerges from it is almost as real as Huckleberry Finn.

And what a man that Mark Twain was! How he stood above and apart from the
world, like Rabelais come to life again, observing the human comedy,
chuckling over the eternal fraudulence of man! What a sharp eye he had for
the bogus, in religion, politics, art, literature, patriotism, virtue! What
contempt he emptied upon shams of all sorts -- and what pity! Mr. Paine
reveals for us very clearly, by quotation and exposition, his habitual
attitude of mind. He regarded all men as humbugs, but as humbugs to be
dealt with gently, as humbugs too often taken in and swindled by their own
humbuggery. He saw how false reasoning, false assumptions, false gods had
entered into the very warp and woof of their thinking; how impossible it
was for them to attack honestly the problems of being; how helpless they
were in the face of life's emergencies. And seeing all this, he laughed at
them, but not often with malice. What genuine indignation he was capable of
was leveled at life itself and not at its victims. Through all his later
years the riddle of existence was ever before him. He thought about it
constantly; he discussed it with everyone he knew; he made copious notes of
his speculations. But he never came to any soothing custom-made conclusion.
The more he examined life, the more it appeared to him to be without
meaning, and even without direction; the more he pondered upon the idea of
God, the more a definite idea of God eluded him. In the end, as Mr. Paine
tells us, he verged toward a hopeless pessimism. Death seemed to him a glad
release, an inestimable boon. When his daughter Jean died, suddenly,
tragically, he wrote to her sister: "I am so glad she is out of it and
safe -- safe!"

It is this reflective, philosophizing Clemens who stands out most clearly
in Mr. Paine's book. In his own works, our glimpses of him are all too
brief. His wife and his friends opposed his speculations, perhaps wisely,
for the artist might have been swallowed up in the sage. But he wrote much
to please himself and left a vast mass of unpublished manuscript behind
him. Certainly it is to be hoped that these writings will see the light,
and before long. One book described by Mr. Paine, "Three Thousand Years
Among the Microbes," would appear to be a satire so mordant and so large in
scale that his admirers have a plain right to demand its publication. And
there should be a new edition, too, of his confession of doubt, "What is
Man?" of which a few copies were printed for private distribution in 1905.
Yet again we have a right to ask for most if not all of his unpublished
stories and sketches, many of which were suppressed at the behest of Mrs.
Clemens, for reasons no longer worth considering. There is good ground for
believing that his reputation will gain rather than suffer by the
publication of these things, and in any case it can withstand the
experiment, for "Huck Finn" and "Life on the Mississippi" and the
"Connecticut Yankee" will remain, and so long as they remain there can be
no question of the man's literary stature. He was one of the great artists
of all time. He was the full equal of Cervantes and Moliere, Swift and
Defoe. He was and is one authentic giant of our national literature.

Thanks Gary for this---
I think that the distinction you make especially toward the end between
"the higher whatever" and "literary chopped liver" is something that
you, for instance, are very good at breaking down---

Yea, verily, there's a stigma about "humour in poetry"
as it is often derided as "light verse" or "not even poetry" by some.
For me, it's a question of "purism" that claims perhaps religious or sublime
seriousness, often cold, can not exist alongside of humor.
such as Dr. Johnson (and even Emerson) being upset that Shakespeare
had all these sublime moments and then all this fool talk,
or people today who invoke Stevens but don't see his humour
Or of course there's many examples today of such slighting of
humorist moments in "higher whatever" poetry---
but it does seem to me that the laugh can include the sublime
much more than the sublime can include the laugh

i don't want to be dogmatic about the laugh---
i don't think it can be written by formula
"a jest's prosperity lies in the ear" (love's labour's lost)
and sometimes so called "serious" poetry does make me laugh
much more than allegedly intentionally funny poetry
(I think Laura Riding is a very funny poet, and also among the most serious...)

i think the best laughs, like the best moments of high seriousness, happen
when they happen, and can't be forced
but i think a lot of folks are told to EDIT out their humour
(or "what may be perceived as humour")
so as not to "sacrifice" what? the purity of the poem?
the old high toned christain? or high toned secular? or high toned leftist?
or high-toned fragment? an attempt to draw a "a line in the sand"
as Bush once put it?
and then these folks, rather humourlously, complain about why poetry
is so marginalized (they often try to edit those complaints out of their
poetry too---so it just shows up in their secret gossipy quips--
all the while being championed as the "higher whatever")

Once I asked a Language poet who I admire what
he thought of a more "mainstream" poet who I admire
who has a reputation for being funny,
and this language poet said "oh, he's too into the easy joke"

a few years later, I asked a famous critic (known for championing
a lot of the language poets) what she thought of the above language
poet who said the "mainstream poet" was too into the "easy joke"
and she said, "X is not a language poet, he's a writer of light verse"
(draw your own conclusions from this....)

So, there's a weird relatively---
just as with the seeming opposite "high seriousness"
for instance, back in days, when I hung with some serious DUNCAN-HEADS
and they measured Duncan's greatness as his visionary sublimity, etc.
and I, preferring Ashbery, would often defend Ashbery as doing all that Duncan
does
in those terms (and I do find Ashbery to be more visionary sublime---in a
non-pejorative sense--than Duncan).
So, too, in terms of humour. It's not always where you think it's going to be.

oh well, here i am talking about humour in ways that probably aren't funny
enough....

does anybody here feel or think poetry can be "legitimately"
called "cathartic" now-a-days?

Chris

This seems like either a legitimate question or a legitimate confusion. My
Google - for "cathartic" says:

Cathartic: The aim of a cathartic intervention is to facilitate the release
or discharge of emotions in the other person. A major part of personal
development work is educating the client or participant to find ways of
releasing blocked energy so that it can be used more constructively and
creatively.
(Most of the other Googled definitions given, by the way, are medical of
which many pertain to relief of constipated bowels)

For "catharsis", however, the definition is more as a literary device:
catharsis {Gk. kaqarsiV [katharsis]}

Cleansing from guilt or defilement; hence, in Aristotle, the elimination of
destructive emotions through appreciation of an aesthetic experience. The
notion here is that vicariously experiencing strong feelings renders us less
likely to be overcome by them in our own lives.

For "legitimate", Mr. Google offers the following for the literary:

Authorized; real; genuine; not false, counterfeit, or
      spurious; as, legitimate poems of Chaucer; legitimate
      inscriptions.
And maybe, more interestingly:
relating to plays acted by professional actors but not including revues,
burlesque, or some forms of musical comedy <the legitimate theater>  (i.e.,
humor??)

I guess I want to ask you, Chris, whose work might you be referring to or
that you read 'in the past' that you found to be "legitimately carthartic"
from the point of view of the reading experience. & what made it so?

Or, from the writing point of view, what does it mean to finish a poem and
have a sense that a "legitimate catharsis" has occurred. One feels: a.
better/relieved, b. a political opponent has been vanquished, c. an
inner-emotional and/or intellectual knot has dissolved, d. a vague search
has materialized in a visible language that carries a weight similar to a
legal validation and authority?? Any, all or more than the above??
Is there some assumption that a "legitimate catharsis" represents a
permanent removal of its previous state of sabotage (the shoe in the gut).


And what makes you wonder - if you are - that such work is no longer so
possible?  Or, in light of the "humor" discussion, is there a suggestion
here  that humor and foolery are the only way to cope in say, for example,
what some may see as a futile landscape - the dark, Beckett-edged stage?

Excuse my speculative ramble - legitimately or not, it just got me thinking
(I think!)

MIME-Version: 1.0

I'd suggest that journalistic humor (from early Twain to
Dave Barry and Woody Allen, whose short pieces were
originally published as so-called "casuals" in the New
Yorker) fulfills too few of the New Critical conditions to
be taken as it were seriously in the classroom or in
lit crit. (I mean this as a neutral observation, not a
critique of humor.) High seriousness would be less
important here than difficulty, paradox, thorny symbolism,
the delayed payoff, the sense (as Rene Girard put it) that
criticism completes the "implicit or already half-explicit
systems" at work in the text. We tend to want to teach and
to demonstrate techniques of interpretation that derive
from that model, even when the inheritance isn't being
acknowledged (New Criticism is often gestured to w/ a kind
of superficial disparagement, as Jed Rasula points out).
Trying to teach Robert Benchley or Woody Allen we would be
left with not enough to tease out -- and I think this is
still true if to a lesser extent for the "rejection of
closure" critical stance that comes out of Language.

Isn't humor more about culture than about form? (In the New
Critical sense -- humor's about form in the
mythic/structuralist sense, yeah, but that's form as
cultural residuum.) There's surely a place for humor as an
artifact in cultural studies -- you could write a
dissertation on Seinfeld if you wanted to, in fact I
wouldn't be suprised if someone has, just as a guy I knew
was planning to write one on the speeches of Ronald Reagan.
But cultural studies operates largely outside the question
of a canon (or depends on a theoretical canon rather than
an artistic one). One could maybe do Freudian readings,
feminist readings, Marxist readings. To some extent these
too depend on the New Critical paradigm -- Freudian
readings want enigmatic dreamtexts to solve, e.g. -- but I
did see a fairly convincing rundown of critical modes
recently, in the Bedford 6th ed. teacher's companion, that
used a humorous New Yorker piece by Joseph Epstein as its
test case.

Pedantically,
Damian

in fact re "terrorism" that one is always going to be problematic,  because
if you condone or support or try to say "well the US (and other Imperialist
Nations' )policies have been bad etc etc even I am expecting someone to say
to me  "But what if your daughter/son was killed in Bali?"  (where I
initially thought) (still possible) that it was an act of agent
provaocateurs...and "What about children and so on being killed"...what
about these "suicide bombers" ..how can you condone that: and so on...and
its pretty heavy because in this present stage of the War against
Imperialism it seems to the ( not very politically well-educated: or with
relatively simplistic understandings of the way capitialism/imperialism
works) that any one even "explaining" terrorism (maybe read independence
fighting or commando actions or independence activism or violent
revolutionary acts or counterattacks or Liberation Struggles)
that we are theoretic armchair monstors: but we have to analyse and think
about what are the fundamental forces at work here (its impossible to be
unemotional - the force of our debate is because we like everyone else are
emotionally battered by the physical and psychological horror of these
events  ( Vietnam to the Philipines to Indonesia  (the millions killed there
and the ongoing  exploitaion) Iraq (the terrible effect of the embargoes,
Iraq in 1990 to Yugoslavia to S11 to Afghanistan to Mombassa)) ...but thus
the vehemence and sometimes extremity of some of my statements:  I was also
concerned that somehow Ron Silliman etc (while he used the dialectic of
Marxism in his poems and writings) and he and others talked of the
non-commodification of the word, the need for the foregrounding of the
signifier , and so on (and while he and David Antin Nick Piombino and
others) were all in various ways very courageously and sometimes
energetically "political" (Nick burnt his draftcard, Atin's talk poems etc ,
Ron was I believe a visitor to prisons etc and also in the anti- (Vietnam
War) protests, I had a sense that the marxist component [that somewhat it
wasnt translating into positive political action although how or why that
should ocur I'm not sure myself]  (of course this political aspect is not
the only one in Language poetry of which I am a big "fan" or I like the
Langpos and the many offshoots (dont like/believe in Social Realism
(especially the Soviet worst) examples) - am even a bit dubious of Amiri
Baraka (although I havent met the guy) [ BUT WAIT -THERE"S MORE   A story
about AMIRI BARAKA!!!] and I agree/disagree with Alan Sondheim who I think
is tapping into some kind of language - wrapped complex which sends out
"psychic" messages which are "repetitions" (and echoes) one thinks of the
conceptual artists eg Haacke and Bueys and the Jenny Holtzer and others (of
course there is a lot more going on in Alan's project which I cant touch on
here) is on one level highly political-social in its approach (there are
also sexual-political and certain ontological-phenomelogical things going on
with vaying degrees of Alanness incorporated): somewhow though I wonder what
is the raisins d'etre of all this stuff (this is something that applies to
my own writing such as it is, so I'm not just pointing at the Langpos eg my
poem RED is, or seems to be as far as I can assess it, is VERY
non-referential and for a long time I was almost scornflul of political
poets (especially of the Amiri Baraka type) (as eventually  there have to be
some things that transcend - are transcendent: we need some rest from the
relentless "realities", some magic: that is another thirst: in fact it may
be why "magic realism" came form South America and so on....not sure what
I'm tapping into here)  (by the way I'm found Joyce Carol Oates "Bellfeur"
 a more realist magic realism) to be in my opinion a possible greater
writer(ing) than Marquez (greater not the right word I say that to draw
attention to her) is a brilliant work, and her short stories some of which
have been made into films, and "You Must Remember This"): so I'm not saying
to Barrett Watten ..hey man , cut all the crap..all those long words...I
LOVE the complexities, the fantastic , the opaque...I hate it when they say
on our concert progrmamme "And your work is [music - contemproary] (I know
its a dirty word) transparent  - ooh there'll  be letters"  (its a cop out
that word "transaprency")  and I share with Nick and others the desire to
enter into the gnomic, the magical almost, the conceptual: the world of
intellection and the world of pleasure, in fact I carry his lates t ptose
poetry book around with nmme in my jacket and have read most of them....). -
some of which is possibly  a tranfigured physical pleasure and becomes for
me very much a pure love of words and word forms and their components and
configurations.

But it is not true that poets are not concerned ONLY with words and concepts
and so on: although that is their main "job" (just as numbers and symbols
and quantites and forces etc are the domainnof physicists and
mathematicians) (I dont know your field or the extent of your knowledge:
I'm just spouting ...you may know all this and more):  but there are
corss-over points between all disciplines -although these are not always
obvious: up to S11 I didnt want to know about the political side of things
very much; I was quite discconnected form "reality" and so on. But since S11
[does there need to be a connection? is it eh "global villgae " we are in
etc? ] one realise that it - disconnection - can become a kind of hermetic
madness (in to srong doses!) ....Aporia ..is that the right term?: its one
that John Geraets who is and innovative writer "down under" has used
recently in a throeretical statement/discussion to BRIEF mag (which Chris
Stroffololino was published in )  (and I would like others to contribute -
contact me - and also some of the diassafected who have left over the
Loney-Geraets-Ross split (!!) ( a bit of "down under
poetics-politics" )....But its good you are taking an interest in the debate
and so on: and showing your students poems on this list etc  it is not just
all vapid nothings in Cyberland ! And yet to some extent I can see Niclk and
others' resistance to being bullied (by the left and the right: and  the
need for aporia or some disconnectedness so to speak): but some counter
bullying may be necessary...maybe.

On a slightly comic note: my friend who is a published poet was a couple of
years back at a poetry festival in South America and at the end of various
readings Amiri Baraka said, summing things up,(to the effect) "I have heard
some of the best poetry read here, some of the very best declamations and
work, but yours"  he here turmed to my friend,  "was the WORST I've ever
heard!!!"  !!

Later he apoligised: actually the person to whom I refer..well he reads in a
way that is often quite artificial...oh well, there's a bit of gossip and
shadenfreude for you!

I've ;eft all the other stuff as I think it may be useful for others who
want to look back aat this thread: thanks for your input.

Subject: Re: the war


Hey all,

I've found this list to be a consistently rewarding experience, though I've
remained largely a silent participant.  I wanted to pick up the thread spun
out and cat's-cradled by Taylor, Watten, Piombino, Vincent, and others
regarding our various "positions" on the impending war on Iraq.  Thanks to
all
of you for worrying over this thread; it gives me a bit of hope that poets
do
have something to say/do in the national and world agenda.  Having worked
for
a number of years on the anti-sanctions campaign in Iraq, I can only say
that,
among progressive political movements, among the most difficult are those
that
attempt to intervene in foreign policy decisions, because they seem most
distant to regular Americans (who fail to see the thousand ways that their
lives are most deeply interconnected with those abroad) and because foreign
policy decisions are the least democratic of all political decisions.

However, these facts do not--and should not--absolve us from intervening in
whatever ways possible, into that discussion.  Certainly every jackass who
sucked Nixon's teat feels the god-given right to do so on national
television.
 I guess I have been a little disappointed that, on the list most associated
with experimental/avant-garde poetics, we have not given much theory nor
demonstrated (at least by virtue of our postings), how in fact we can begin
to
intervene in the discussions about this impending war.  When Steve Taylor
suggests that he hasn't heard much noise from "the anti-war movement," I
would
like to suggest to Steve, YOU ARE THE ANTI-WAR MOVEMENT.  It is time we made
some noise.  Of course those who for years have carried the peace torch have
done much organizing over this issue, of course there have been
demonstrations
and protests, of course Marin County artists have turned their naked bodies
into PEACE, of course all of this has happened.  The impression that the
anti-war movement is silent is brought to you by CNN, who always represents
anti-war protest as a foreign phenomenon, in which illegible or untranslated
signs (quite literally) suggest the illegibility of the antiwar
counterdiscourse itself.

We need a panoply of poetic and political strategies to figure out ways to
render that illegibility more legible.  I'm heartened by Taylor's downunder
provocations, Watten's consistently oppositional voice (see Bad History),
but
I'm a little surprised we haven't heard much from others.  I don't expect
that
everyone agree with an oppositional position vis-a-vis the "war on/of
terror",
but I sort of demand an explanation for our quietism.  This war is tearing
my
insides out.  Hundreds of thousands died in the last war, to protect an
undemocratic oil fiefdom.  What will happen this time?

Thanks to all the people who have bent my brains on this list: the
abovementioned, as well as shout-outs to Mike Magee--I taught your
"Political
Song/Confused Voicing" for an hour last week, and my students really dug it;
Anselm Berrigan (nice to know there's another Pavement-head out there);
Patrick Herron, for the posting about the antiwar anthology, thanks man;
Maria
Damon, love your work on poetry!; and countless others whose names I can't
remember now who have been working it.

Peace out, Phil Metres

>Subject: "Blue Hyacinth" by Pauline Masurel
>
>It's a pleasure to publish Pauline Masurel's piece "Blue Hyacinth" at
>http://vispo.com/StirFryTexts/bluehyacinth3.html (requires IE 4+).
>
>There's discussion between Pauline and me concerning "Blue Hyacinth" and
the
stir frys at
>http://vispo.com/StirFryTexts/mazconv.htm .
>
>"The story has already been written...her blue hyacinth voice.
>The story has already been written another in the corner is smoking.
>The story has already been written in colour.
>The story has already been written and he's just here now to watch it
played
out."
>
>In one of the four texts, we read of a night club owner's remote reaction
to
his blowing up a
>rival night club called The Blue Hyacinth. In another, a woman describes
the
actions of someone
>who broke into her house and left voice recordings on all her tapes, leaves
voice messages on
>her phone, "it goes on for months, her blue hyacinth voice." In another of
the texts, a woman
>relates of having won money bet on Blue Hyacinth at the track, and her own
inexplicable giving
>up of the winnings.
>
>Masurel has used the mechanism of the stir fry to transform fictive
stories/vignettes into a
>vortex of poetry...and back again to fiction, as you please.
>
>Many thanks to Pauline for "Blue Hyacinth" and its transformations through
the shapes of fiction
>and poetry.
>
>There are now five stir fry texts involving various participants: Pauline,
Brian Lennon, Leo
>Marx, Jerome McGann, Talan Memmott, Mary Phillips, Joseph Weizenbaum, Lee
Worden, and
>translation into Chinese of one of them by Shuen-shing Lee. They have been
published in the Iowa
>Review Web, ubu.com, DOC(K)S from France, Taiwan, and offline in Denmark.
The
project was
>started in 1999 and may or may not be finished according to whether the
form
inspires others to
>do something different with it, as Pauline has.
>
>The stir fry form keys on the DHTML innerHTML method which allows you to
change the HTML code
>inside a <SPAN> or <DIV>. Pauline's "Blue Hyacinth" can transform into
>4^30=1,152,921,504,606,846,976 different texts as you mouse over it. So the
'whole thing' will
>never be read. But neither need all 1,152,921,504,606,846,976 different
texts
be read to grasp
>what we would call 'the meaning' of the piece.
>
>As we move into combinatorially complex works, we realize that what it
means
to read a
>combinatorium with subtlety and comprehension does not involve the
necessarily impossible task
>of reading all the possibilities of a combinatorium but, rather, getting a
sense of the
>directions in which the possibilities tend by sampling them until they
begin
to diminish in
>significant difference. In the end, we see that the mind ranges very
quickly
through
>1,152,921,504,606,846,976 despite its seeming insuperability. A text of
>1,152,921,504,606,846,976 possibilities is still amenable to the creation
of
meaning on a human
>scale not simply by disregarding most of the possibilities, but by virtue
of
the way the
>underlying 4 texts guide the reader through primary (spanning set) spaces
of
meaning.
