Dear Colleagues,
        considering the information blockade in our country, we are
trying
to inform universities all over the world via Internet. The situation in
Belgrade and Serbia is more and more dramatic. The protest of students

is
on for three days allready, with full support of our professors. Beside
Belgrade University, all larger university centers in Serbia are also in
protest. We ask you to inform students of your universities as to what
is
happening here. Every kind of support comming from you will be highly
appriciated.

                        Declaration of Decency

        We, the students of the Belgrade University, support the
citizens
of Serbia, who demand the protection of their rights, guaranteed by the
Constitution. Brutal violation of law and annihilation of regular
electoral
results are the unprecedented attack on the basic principles of
democracy.

We are not taking sides between the party in power and the opposition -
what
we insist upon is the rule of law. Any government unwilling to
acknowledge
the electoral defeat is not worth of our support, and we are overtly
opposing it.

Therefore, we demand:

        Immediate establishment of State's Electoral Committee, which
will be formed on proportional principles by the parties that took part
in a second ballot. The purpose of this Committee will be to
objectivelly establish the outcome of the second ballot. We apeal on
all participants of the current political crisis to sustain from any and
all violence.  The students of the Belgrade University will endure in
their protest.


                                   University of Belgrade

in addition to gene pitney, what about frankie laine?...

for that matter, i've always liked the way tex ritter's "do not forsake me"
rumbles around in the background of *high noon*...

and then there's the 'sons of the pioneers' too (as in *the searchers*)...

what about the soundtrack to *urban cowboy*... which puts us smack dab in
the middle of c & w, and with somebody like charlie daniels (whose more
recent stuff is really problematic) we fall over into 'southern rock' and
such...

anyway, that singin cowboy stuff goes back a looong way---and it's still a
vital aspect of u.s. americana... i don't mean grand ole opry
either---all's you have to do is attend a
c & w performance at one of the major rodeos to see how passionate the
following is (this is probably not news to anybody here)...  and that
brings us back to cowboy poetry...

almost typed 'cowbody' poetry---now THERE'S somethin new...

hey, anybody seen that off-broadway show *cowgirls*?... i'm wondering if
it's pulling in the direction of *oklahoma* or *guys and dolls*?...

burt, why is a phud in creative writing (say, writing a novel for a diss)
any more scam-ish than writing a critical-theoretical diss?... i say this
as somebody who holds a doctor of arts (d.a.---not a ph.d, though an earned
doctorate) and who has had to put up with a LOT of grief for not possessing
those other three letters... the two singular characteristics of my degree
program (and the history of the d.a. goes back to mit in the 60s) was that
it (1) provided courses in pedagogical theory (which most phuds in english
now do, to a greater or lesser extent) and (2) permitted a "creative" diss.
(which many phuds in english did then, and do now)...

anyway... i feel a bit personally invested in this distinction (or lack
thereof) twixt d.a. and ph.d, and for many it turns primarily on (2)
above...

joe,

one of my colleagues has a d.a. in creative writing from syracuse; luckily,
at my school (njit) no one has a problem with this. also, a friend of
mine, and a fine poet (i'll not name him wihout permision), opted not
to flesh out a wonderful doctoral thesis on critical theory and beckett
and instead to submit a collection of poems for a ph.d. in creative
writing. i think highly of both of these people. however, as you have
suggested, they would do better with classical ph.d.--not to say that there
may not be room for change in this regard. first of all, i would have loved
(pace, those out there who might feel that there is already too much
narrowly focused or perhaps frivolous literary scholarship, and thus it's
good that university presses are now looking to operate in the black) to
have read the finished theory-beckett product, and so would have others.
second, and here's my original point, unlike the world of scholarship
(though,again, this may change if something is not done about the
university press situation), there is a "real" world beyond the academy
for people to publish and perhaps thrive in; that is, a phud in
journalism, say, or novel writing, is superfluous, since the ultimate
test/recognition comes from the communications media and either small
or large presses, respectively.  There is something of the hothouse
flower about a phud in creative writing, it seems to me.
does a writing program, furthermore, which is looking for new faculty, take
an applicant with a phud in creative writing more seriously than someone
without one?  Indeed, it seems to me that I would rather hire someone who
has actually published books, or at least someone who has a portfolio of
interesting work (to say nothing of teaching ability), than someone with
the degree (let's throw in the mfa here too) as the sine qua non of
certification. and isn't academe too institutionalized already, when it
comes to liteary scholarship (where are the Alfred Kazins, Irving Howes and
George Lyman Kittredges--all with only bachelor's degees--or yesteryear)?
so why create some new overly wrought system, when systems can in fact have
a stifling effect?

re: burt kimmelman: " to my mind, there is something scammish about it, =
but i'm ready to be convinced otherwise."

to preface: i'm suspicious of the way "writing" becomes/became "creative =
writing."  I wrote as a kid, I write as an adult, I happen to be a =
student of poetics in a ("diverse" to some minds, "bifurcated" to =
others) phd-cw program. (SF State it ain't -- but if they had a phd, i'd =
have applied there.)

        I can't speak to a(re?)warding cw phd's, but I'll say a thing or 2 =
about why i'm pursuing one -- not to be writing, not for "a community of =
poets" -- but for (sheer pragmatics?) library access, email, an income, =
and critical discourse. =20

sure, workshops ("required") have their limited usefulness --  a "slash =
& burn" (i.e. workshop) mentality does tend to want to prevail, & and a =
kind of ("industry") verse is, to a certain extent, practiced.   But =
even the most industrious students at Utah are fighting for workshop =
pedagogy that involves recognition/discussion of poetic/aesthetic =
"differences."

I think poets will get what they demand/come looking for.  If, as Donald =
Revell says, american poetry is written to figure out the problems of =
american poetry, (un)fortunately workshops can only somewhat accomodate =
that (i'm okay with that myself).  As for the program -- there are =
students & faculty who do & can speak to my not-so-mainstream concerns =
as a (postmodern)(post-structuralist) poet. =20

As for "the spectres of "good"/"bad" and a single correct upper middle =
class media culture.  <><>shiver><><" (tom bell) -- of course the U. can =
only do what it can do.  Academia _is_ disturbingly platonic, but the U. =
I know is riddled with heraclitians. Students & faculty (at Utah) who =
shiver along with you, and then do something "academic" about it.  It's =
the need/demand thing again. =20

I don't know who's scamming who.  (Maybe i'll have a sense of that after =
i've earned my three letters.)  I also know a phd-cw is no commodity.  =
Certain kinds of poetry are more of a commodified than others.  When the =
"avant garde" is mainstreamed (via academia?) what will the new avante =
garde look like?  how will poets go about solving the problems of =
american poetry?=20

(I'm not sure but i think it's written somewhere in the bylaws that i'm =
required to acknowledge the university (& state) of Utah for its =
patronage.)

burt, i guess i view the matter from the pov of one who has seen the d.a.
go the way of the dodo bird, at suny/albany, and who has been forced to
ponder long and hard over what exactly happened... albany in effect *had*
to convert to the phud in order to maintain solvency... and the history and
continuing turmoil resulting from that turn-of-events was and is a thing to
behold... but here i would like to be certain to distinguish between the
"realities" of the marketplace for d.a.'s or phud's in creative writing
(what IS) and what we might be able to do under the rubric of same (what
OUGHT to be)....

(in fact, albany *lost* it's phud in the late 70s, which left it with only
the d.a. as a 'terminal' degree... long story, but as i say, to understand
the d.a., you needs must look at how it came into being, was popularized at
places like u of michigan, etc... and subsequently dropped by a number of
campuses, though it still lives on at a number of campuses...)

i see the hothouse flower development you suggest in phud programs all
over... that is, i see the development of a particular sort of academic
professional as no less problematic than the development of a particular
sort of creative writer... i'm not sure i see this as a creative writing
problem, b/c in effect the proof for creative writers may not be in any
'real world' pudding, esp. given the small press publishing situation you
refer to... i would submit that *any* phud program these days is
jeopardized with the 'credentializing' stigma that currently associates
with a terrrible marketplace (both wrt publishing and wrt jobs)...

but here, again, i'm not quite sure exactly you mean, burt, by a phud in
creative writing???.. how do you envision this?... my wife kass fleisher
has a phud in english, did a novel for her diss, and had in effect not only
to pass all the 'regular' english-phud requirements, but had to repeat
coursework she'd already completed b/c of a negative perception of creative
writers... now surely when she applies for a job, there are those academics
who look at her vita and say, 'well HERE'S somebody who doesn't understand
literary scholarship'... as opposed, say, to observing that her decision to
complete a novel was perhaps motivated by an informed decision to enter
into a somewhat different discourse community...

you see burt?---i'm not quite sure why i should be predisposed against
creative writing as an academic pursuit, *except* to the very extent to
which i am predisposed against *any* such academic pursuit... though
academe-centered writing would appear to be, on the surface of it, a more
suitable justification of pursuing a phud than, say, non-academe-centered
writing, the current economies writers are faced with, whether situated
inside or outside of academe, suggest similar problematics and similar
possibilities... albeit i grant that there are differences, as you suggest,
i don't grant, not anymore anyway, any hard & fast distinctions between
these pursuits insofar as academic programming goes...

best,

joe

Okay, I don't live in an Eng. dept so I've kept my mouth shut, but hey,
scam or not, it gets money to folks who write; some of them even write
(forgive me Maria) well.

It's like back in the glory days of NSF when research grants were easy to
get and my mother (of all people) complained out that it was her tax
dollars paying people like me to do what I would do anyway.  A scam?
Maybe, but it kept people in the business.

nervously getting ready to teach Erica Hunt's /Local Histories/ to a (very
good) ug class--have never taught her work before.

any words of wisdom floating around out there?

key essays by her that folks would recommend?

line of the day:

"I could throw away my hat, I need the target practice." (/Local Histories/ 9)

we're coming off a discussion of Leslie Scalapino's /Way/, which I think
provides a good context ("Bum Series" especially).

thanks in advance

Dear Joel Felix -
You wrote "    But I saw this film with abt 15 friends 7 of them female
and only one woman cared for it much, and she with a shrugging off of the
fact that all this damnation in the movie stems from (1) capital (trade,
industry, land) and (2) the poor judgement of women.  I won't rehash the
plot here, but i'm curious if anyone else read the film as damn near
misogenist."

I really liked "Dead Man" - a wonderful allegorical parody of the American
Wild West AND Westerns...
as for misogyny - it was of the times wasn't it ?

Description of general contents:

This is an up-to-date consideration of 20th century visual and concrete=
 poetry=20
by major participants in its creative and critical exposition. Critical=20
approaches, historical contexts, and basic concepts are surveyed in two=20
introductory essays, while the study of poetic movements in historical=
 context=20
and the chronological trajectory of production of experimental texts are=20
discussed in the first major segment of the volume, "Experimentation in Its=
=20
Historical Moment." The second major theme, focused upon in the section=20
"Experimentation in the Language Arts," is that of language as a vehicle for=
=20
experiments and cognitive quests, aimed not at the production of truth or=
 social
emancipation but at experiential aspects of language and language use. The=
=20
development of the basic tenets of concrete poetry and current critical=20
perspectives on its status in poetical experimentation constitute the basis=
 of=20
the third section of the book, "Concrete and Neo-Concrete Poetry."  =09
        Synthesizing historical and theoretical perspectives, this volume is of=20
crucial interest to students of contemporary poetics, theories of poetic=20
language, and the visual component of literary production. Derived from a
symposium held at Yale University in April 1995, the book includes a
roundtable discussion on theory and practice of (contemporary) avant-garde
poetry and other current concerns among poets and critics in this field. All
critical materials are=20
published here for the first time.

Dear Pam Brown
        Yes, it was.  Jarmusch may have been sending up the "hysterical"
roles of women in Westerns, and if so I'm guilty of a bad read of that
aspect.

Joe,

I am glad for your wife, and for my anonymous friend who was at SUNY
Binghamton who took the same option as she did--and I suppose that the
combination of scholarly training up to but not including the doctoral
thesis, and to some extent a demonstrated ability in creative writing
(yes, i hate this phrase too), would be attractive for a certain niche
in academe; still, perhaps she would have used her time more wisely by
dealing with the "real" publishing world instead of with some dusty old
doctoral committee.  But anyway most jobs will be filled by people
who have completed a "scholarly" dissertation--which is, ultimately,
a quite different kind of creature.

I guess what I am really getting at, now in hindsight, is that scholarship
and criticism, on the one hand, and poetry and fiction (and creative
non-fiction, etc.) on the other hand, are quite different and should be
acknowledged differently.  When I say here "should" i mean that advisedly;
but it's just that one is playing for keeps while the other is workaday.
I say this having published some scholarship I am proud of and believing
in the beauty of a sort and elegance and brilliance of some scholarship
that has been published by others (some on this list).  But I am also
proud and more importantly happy about some poetry I've published,
and in the end it is the writing of poetry that keeps me alive, not
the scholarship no matter how noble, how profound, how elegant it might
be.

Very, very few critics or scholars are read beyond their own time, whereas
there are scores, hundreds of what we call great "writers"--Shakespeare
fi


for instance--whom we read and I dare say always will (at least, I hope we
will).

But hey, there's room for all, right?

I'd like a world in which there was a distinction between a doctorate OF
arts and a PhD, with the distinction based upon the type of work done for
the degree (and thus, perhaps, the type of work for which one is
training) -- As it is, though there are so few PhDs in Creative Writing
that one must inspect individual work closely to see what it is the
person you're hiring might be ready to do (as I would damn well hope all
application materials are inspected anyway, but know they aren't) -- I
wouldn't ordinarily want to hire a PhD in Medieval Studies to teach a
grad. creative writing seminar -- and wouldn't ordinarily want to hire a
PhD in creative writing to teach Beowulf -- BUT would indeed do so if
that person had published work that demonstrated their qualification to
teach that field --

The few people I know of with PhDs in Creative Writing are able,
talented, and well-trained far beyond creative writing seminars

This is Dodie.

There were four of us who went to see Dead Man:  one female with a Ph.D. in
poetics, one male with a Ph.D. in poetics, one male with an ABD in English,
and one female with a lowly masters in comp lit.  All of us loved
it--though I must say that the review of the movie I read in People in my
acupuncturist's waiting room was scathing.  I don't remember thinking about
mysogyny when I saw Dead Man.  I do remember thinking how wonderfully
de-romanticizing it was of the western myth (the disturbingness of the
brutality), even though in hindsight the film was very romanticized--how
could it not be with Johnny Depp's puppy-dog eyes and that gorgeous
cinematography.

Speaking of Jarmusch--the other day KK and I were watching Howard the Duck
(which I strongly recommend if you are, like me, into the perverse) on
TV--and during a scene where Howard the Duck gets in a fight in a bar I
started squawking and gesturing towards one of the badguys in the bar,
"That's the actor I saw on the street in L.A. a year ago!"  I'd been
waiting all this time to point him out to KK.  KK informed me he was the
star of Stranger than Paradise.

Rod,

I know what you're saying cos when teaching I'm always having to say it.
But, and this thread has been left dangling because of it, I want to put
in a couple of good words  for taste. As who it was who started this
said, taste judgements are about not explaining yourself. There are
contexts in which this is the better ( the 'cooler') option. Taste is
more about being than knowing, its more performative. A person who
thinks all sorts of thing are good of their kind, and if they're not
good at least they're interesting in a cultural studies kinda way, runs
the risk of sounding dumb, disengaged,  or patronizing depending on the
circumstances... Whereas the person with violent narrow tastes means
business. Such persons are very clear about what their interests are,
and not only don't they  care if that puts you on the spot, they hope it
does. I don't know about you, but I still find the modernist dismissals
of vast tracts of past art, literature, engaging, as I find my
children's sometime  boredom, dislike, hatred even , of music I hold
dear impressive, and in a sense beyond dispute. Taste judgements are
proper to an aesthetic economy which shouldn't nessarily be explained
away.

I'll take the risk of sounding "dumb, disengaged, or patronizing" to folks
with "violent narrow tastes" any time.  "Taste judgments are about not
explaining yourself" sounds to this reader a lot like "Love means never
having to say you're sorry," or, better yet, "What do you want?  Good
grammar or good taste?"  In short--meaningless pablum, mouthed as if there
was a there there.

Yeah, I think all sorts of things are good of their kind, and it's my task
to figure out what *kind* of thing I'm looking at, and what standards might
be most useful to use in judgement.  That seems to me both smart, and
engaged.  It's a whole lot less patronizing to attempt to understand
something on its own terms than it is to dismiss it entire, without
explanation or attention beyond the knee-jerk, "I don't like this."  Mostly
I find that, when applied to entire genres, "I don't like this" translates
into, "I can't be bothered to spend the time learning to read this stuff,
and if I don't already understand it, it's probably not worth anything anyway."

What's with the Law & Order approach to aesthetics, the slap of the
truncheon against the hand, "meaning business"?  I can just see the Culture
Thugs, guys in turtlenecks with attitudes and berets, supervising the
bulldozing of "vast tracts of past art,literature" into trenches, as they
chant, "I don't care, I don't like it; I don't care; I don't like it.  I
don't like it; it isn't good. I don't like it; it isn't good."

Taste is fine, as far as it goes.  It's sort of like opinions.  Everybody's
got opinions, but not everyone's opinions are equally supportable.  You can
stop with "I like it" or "I hate it," just as you can say, "Well, that's my
opinion."   But to leave it at that is to refuse to interrogate the cultural
structures which contain and shape your tastes, and to refuse to hold
yourself to rigorous standards of analysis and argument. Wystan, *your*
tastes may be indefensible.  Mine are not.

Subject:      Scammish

The idea that there might be something "scammish" about a PhD in
creative writing or in a d.a. suggests that there is something "legit"
about a critical dissertation. That I think is exactly the point that
the New Critics were trying to drive home as "specialized readers" only
to be cornered by Frye et al later who noted (to the embarrassment of
all) that so many of gnu critics were compromised because they were
poets. Which is of course precisely the stand-off that was in place
when so many of the creative writing programs came into being during
the post-WW2 explosion of higher (hire) ed, a "safe" place for the
poets far far from theory, etc.

Whatever legitimacy the critical dissertation had, however, really
depended on there being a significant number of jobs that candidates
were being honed to compete for. When the percentage of PhDs who could
get jobs dropped below 50 percent (and it seems to be well under 25
percent today for most of the English & Lit categories, down to 11
percent for linguistics last year), grad school became something else.
Without those graduate students, a lot of faculty would not be needed.
So in fact it became a "buyers" market, much in the way that the vanity
press is a buyers market for publication.

It would seem that the major difference between the critical and
creative PhDs is that one doesn't pretend to be the grand job tool that
the other wishes it still were. If your primary motivation for doing
this isn't because you want both the education AND the process as a
thing in itself (and there is no doubt that they *can* have enormous
value in their own right), then you're just fodder in a rather large
Ponzi scheme, there to keep your professors employed.

Seems to me that all humanities/arts students should presume that no
job will await them for this effort. Then whatever follows will be
legit no matter what the acronym for it might be.

Subject:      TOMORROW PEOPLE

  For of those of you who (like Chris Funkhouser) are doing dissertations on
TECHNO-POETRY, etc., this may be of interest
(and for others too)--
   In this week's VOICE, an article by David Gallagher called
   Cyber--the subject of which is "MacProse" which is a POETRY program
(making me wonder if "francine poetry" is really a prose-writer)--subtitled
ROLL OVER, KEATS...
    the most interesting part of the article is this:
       "Avoiding the typical lilt and cadence of the lecturn,
        I read this sample of MacProse to the poet John Ashbery:
       "Towns--where have they hastened? What has vengeance
        molded? Spring moves. Vinyards sleep. The listening
        street has killed it."
    "I'm afraid I may get put out of business for saying this,"
    Ashbery quips, "but I like all of these lines." Explaining that
    he "would never rule out any way of doing anything, includ-
   ing poetry," he stresses that poetry is "always result rather
   than process." (VOICE 12-3-96)
     Well, aside from Ashbery's last quote--which seems
     weird and perhaps taken out of context (what is "result"
    vs. "process" here and how does that not contradict official
    avant garde pieties, etc.)
    I am interested in the lines of MacProse themselves....
    Insofar as there can be "meaning" in them, it seems that
    the meaning is somewhat VESTIGIAL and actually ANTI-
   technological, or one could say the "airy nothing" of this
   computer program has a wry sense of irony...
   IT is wreaking VENGEANGE--and KNOWS It is--on the TOWNS
   and IT is the listening street....any others?

Sometimes this distinction signals the difference between the
academic "sovereign" of the material and the person finding a way
through to their own art. Is that what you mean by "meaning business",
Wystan?  Reading Olson is like that. He read not to "master" material
or to "explain" to others, but to hew his own path, and you either
stay on for the ride or not. That's why all the academics (at Buffalo,
etc.--though not Al Cook) tend to get so upset when confronted with
Olson's "scholarship".

Ooops, gotta run, the baby just woke up.

As I remarked to Pierre in a back-channel communique last week, Rio
Bravo saved my life many a time.

Yes, Eldorado is a wonderful film. Mitchum is spectacular as described.
And the lighting of the film is very special. Lots of interiors, and
Hawks had his folks looking at Dutch painting and Chardin, etc. as
modeling material. Also, the lovely tacked-on ending with Wayne and
Mitchum both on crutches explaining to each other their mutual
irrelevance.

Rio Bravo and Eldorado were, btw, the first two of a trilogy. The third
was Rio Lobo, and I believe this was Hawks' last film. It's a very
strange film, divided in two and with a lot of weird effect-ideas
(trains sliding backwards on greased rails... that kind of thing).

Few have mentioned seeing The Shootist, and if you haven't I strongly
recommend it. Wayne, dying of cancer at the time, plays an old
gunfighter at the turn of the century. Like the actor, the character is
dying of cancer. The film narrates his last week, during the whole of
which J.B. Books (the protagonist) slowly reads a newspaper story of
the death of Queen Victoria while battling inside to a conclusion of
active thought which is utterly wonderful.

Don Siegel directed The Shootist. Again, I don't think I'm wrong in
saying it was his last film. You will know him from The Killers, Dirty
Harry and many other tremendous works.

One day in February 1975, Don Siegel asked me to be his dialogue
director. His previous dialogue directors had included Sam Peckinpah
and John Cassavetes. I said no. He didn't have a project on the table;
it would have meant moving from SF to LA; I was working on a first book
of poems. I sometimes wonder...

Another time, I'll tell the story of how I came to meet him. From that
story I do remember landing at the Burbank airport and as I stepped
outside seeing a Navy plane go nose down into the runway. I was so
freaked out I then walked the entire way from the airport to
Universal. In cowboy boots. The afternoon I spent with Don Siegel began
with lunch in the Universal cafeterias (movie stars in line with
trays). Blisters were swelling in my boots. By 2pm I was dragging
myself along in intense pain (feet) and pleasure (everything else).

Johny Guitar was a Nicholas Ray film, and yes it's amazing.

Someone remember the name of hte Lang western with Marlene Dietrich? A
ranch that's a hideout for bandits.... Destry Rides Again (is that
right?)

Anyway, another incredible film.

Ron -- like the good/bad writing issue, not liking John Wayne is a
measure essentially of inattention to the work itself. Watch The
Searchers, and tell me you are not seeing an incredible performance
artist at work. Subtlety, not grossness, is the measure of his work --
on the other hand yes he did some bad work late (and early) in life.
Rooster Cogburn kind of stuff. And his directorial skills (viz. The
Alamo and his Vietnam film whose name I forget) were right up there
with his political thinking.

My mom, btw, had a date with John Wayne (why do I always descend to
these personal stories?).

tom, hey, keep them personal stories coming!...

yeah, wayne in *the searchers* is incredibly nuanced... while i wasn't near
as crazy about *the shootist* (and although i've always liked don siegel's
work), it's still a solid film with solid performances... i find wayne
utterly believable in his last role... might mention here one of my
favorite cowboy villains, richard boone (hero of tv's *have gun will
travel*), who played one of the bad guys to wayne in *the shootist* and
*big jake* (this latter pretty bad), but really showed-off his villainous
side best in *hombre*... and was quite good with stuart whitman in *rio
conchos* too (this latter is jim brown's first film---boone plays a guy who
hates native americans for having killed his family, as i recall)...

speaking of siegel, i esp. like *the beguiled*, with eastwood... and
speaking of eastwood, i think *unforgiven* is good but overrated, and find
his *the outlaw---josey wales* an interesting flick, finally... and in fact
howard hughes' *the outlaw* is worth catching---pretty bizarre in its
way...

there's always the 'mountain man' genre, and here i think *jeremiah
johnson* (redford/pollack) is best (will geer is great in it)...

re anthony mann westerns, just saw *the far country* again yesterday...
really, the location shooting alone is enough reason to watch (for me
anyway)...

and i might mention a film that makes somewhat different use of the
territory around tucson, *white of the eye*... though not a western (it's
about a present-day psychopath), it threads c & w music throughout, and
appears at times to be making a statement about contemporary survivalism...
violent, disturbing, and stunningly shot and edited... but most def. not
for all tastes, and the victims are, as has become par for this sorta
flick, all women...

You can download MacProse from
http://www.conncoll.edu/ccother/cohar/programs/index.html

It's a Charles O Hartman program, and he bills it as a prose program
(hence the name, which also tells you that its a Macintosh program).  It
gerenates sentences based on the grammatical structures you specify (tho you
can just let it generate them without your input, in which case it follows
grammatical rules programmed in.

Bridge Street is not a large store, it can only comfortably accomodate a

Also, Mark implies the list for the group reading to be "current" -- i.e.
that it is still open. That's not actually the case. There may be additional

i think ron's post summarizes for me the problem wrt 'creative' vs.
'critical' diss. (nevermind how fraught these distinctions are in
actuality)... though as a poet i recognize immediately that my concerns as
a writer are in many ways different than my more 'scholarly' colleagues, i
don't believe that this is intrinsic to our pursuits... rather, i think it
emerges from the way we've been educated (which in turn results, for
example, in different writing conventions)... we've been educated, formally
or informally, to come to "creative writing" or to "criticism" in specific
ways---and markets have developed to shape publishing or job realities
accordingly... i'm trying to say alla this, mind you, w/o indicating what
my values are specifically---though of course emphasizing "education" as
such is one indication of where i place value...

it's precisely in such terms that i found rasula's book so remarkable---i
wish to hell i could get my colleagues (ALL of 'em) to read it, b/c i've
little doubt they'd see themselves to varying degrees participating in the
'new critical' machinery he unveils...

i suppose one could just accept the way the markets operate, and use this
logic as a feedback mechanism to guide and/or justify educational
objectives... such in many ways is where the logic of some cultural studies
approaches the logic of the corporation (that book i mentioned by bill
readings is in my head here, _the university in ruins_)---by which i don't
mean to slam cultural studies, only to indicate that in describing the
apparatus of culture, it *can* result in a closed-loop, circulatory system
wherein everything is convertible according to various (cultural) exchange
values... on the other hand, exposing the mechanisms of culture as such can
help us to see more clearly how these mechanisms operate, and why... and
mebbe with this info., we can more constructively try to change things,
perhaps by attending less to the marketplace as such and by attending more
to forging, say, new (network) collectives...

anyway...

I agree with you Tom about John Wayne. In his mature years he developed an
amazing style and remains way underrated as a performer. Garry Wills
recently did a nice piece on him in The New Yorker called "John Wayne's
Body" all about the Duke's incredible physical grace (walking on tiptoe,
etc.). Great photo of him lounging in a casual suit, looking pensive, one
hand on his daschund (!) and wearing really cool socks.A writer I knew once
saw him in the commisary at Paramount in the 70's: the Duke had his own
private helicopter, from which he entered the lower spheres deus ex machina
and then sat, as at a throne, while every major star and studio boss lined
up to pay him homage, like watching a papal audience complete with ring
kisssing. Great story about Don Siegel!

TheLang/ Dietrich film is "Rancho Notorious." I always thought of "Eldorado"
as a burlesque remake of "Rio Bravo" which itself is rather burlesque.
Haven't seen "Rio Lobo" yet.

Johny Guitar was a Nicholas Ray film, and yes it's amazing.

Someone remember the name of hte Lang western with Marlene Dietrich? A
ranch that's a hideout for bandits.... Destry Rides Again (is that
right?)

Anyway, another incredible film.

Ron -- like the good/bad writing issue, not liking John Wayne is a
measure essentially of inattention to the work itself. Watch The
Searchers, and tell me you are not seeing an incredible performance
artist at work. Subtlety, not grossness, is the measure of his work --
on the other hand yes he did some bad work late (and early) in life.
Rooster Cogburn kind of stuff. And his directorial skills (viz. The
Alamo and his Vietnam film whose name I forget) were right up there
with his political thinking.

My mom, btw, had a date with John Wayne (why do I always descend to
these personal stories?).

The undergraduates will keep professors employed, although not entirely to
the professors' liking.  Teaching assistantships give graduate students a
few years in a day job which has, built into it, time to write. The pay
stinks and the benefits are lousy, but it's less tiring for most folks than
working at McD's.

From the standpoint of the universities, graduate programs are necessary to
provide graduate students to teach undergraduates cheaply.  They'd love to
fire all the profs and hire only grad students and other temps.

11% employment in linguistics.  That really stinks.

        The Fritz Lang film Tom Mandel asked about--with Marlene
Dietrich--is Rancho Notorious.
        It's interesting how many directors of good film noirs--made good
westerns:  Don Siegal, Sam Fuller, Robert Aldrich, Fritz
Lang, Nicholas Ray, Dennis Hopper, Hawks, Huston. (a bizarre twist on
this being Joseph Lewis' Gun Crazy . . . ).
        A western triple feature:  the dying John Wayne in The Shootist,
the dying Steve McQueen in Tom Horn and Marilyn, Monty and Gable near
death in The Misfits . . .
        (For late night die hards--andy Warhol's Lonesome Cowboys . . . )

        Though--aren't Westerns really documents and dreams--of
Colonialists  . . .
        (Are Atala and Rene and Moll Flanders "proto-westerns" .
. .)  (There was period in the sixties when spaghetti westerns were the
most popular films in a good part of the "Third World" . . .and in
europe--breaking the spell of the Winnetou series . . .)
        A good book on the subject:  Spaghetti Westerns by Christopher
Frayling (London;  Routledge and Kegan Paul, 1981).
        And a very enjoyable one on the subject:  Les bons. les sales,
les mechants et les propres de Sergio Leone by Gilles Lambert (Paris:
Solar, 1976).  Some good interview material and background on Leone's
early work in the "classical/biblical"epic  genre--his own last Days of
Pompeii and Collussus of
Rhodes--work on Ben Hur, Quo Vadis, Helen of Troy (Leone claims he
lobbied hard to get Brigitte Bardot her first role in this--as a slave)
and as well his appearance as a priest in Bicycle Thief by de Sica . . .
        "You see, in this world there are two kinds of people, my
friend.  Those with loaded guns, and those who dig.  You dig."
        --The Good the Bad and the Ugly

Pat Pritchett reminds me that the Fritz Lang western with Marlene
Dietrich is "Rancho Notorious" -- and a wonderful film it is.

Destry Rides Again... I can't remember what this name fits however.

Kali Tal chides me writely for the phrase "film as poetic act" which in
her view (I assume gender from the name) threatens the specificity of
the poetic. Really, it is the specificity of the filmic act which is
under siege in my words, which were obviously just another imperial
invasion of film by an ethereal caucasian from rhyme.

The Searchers as a Vietnam war film, however, I don't know. My copy of
Leonard Maltin is out of reach (and I can't see through its cover any
more) but if memory serves that film was made in the late fifties.

Now. Who has seen Taza, Son of Cochise? Or, for that matter, Sign of
the Pagan -- about Rome not the West. (There is a connection. See
below). Both by Douglas Sirk, high on my list of the ten greatest
directors ever. Introduced to me by the sorely missed Warren Sonbert.

The connection: when Hawks was making the Egyptians (or is that Land of
the Pharoahs? -- damn but the force is weak and I can't draw that
Maltin volume with a glance) he had William Faulkner doing dialogue and
Faulkner complained that he was having a hard time getting a voice
going for the Pharoah. "I can't help you, Bill" Hawks replied "I don't
know what a Pharoah sounds like any more than you." "Can I make him
sound like a Kentucky Colonel," Faulkner asked, "I know how they talk."
"Why not?" returned Hawks -- and that's enough of a connection for me.

Remind me, one of these days, to tell this list about my date with
Jessica Lang, and my attempt to pick up Faye Dunaway at a party. Good
stories both, tho rather weak in the denouement department.

Yes, I'm intrigued by the contradictions in the result/process
opposition, too.
There is an emphasis (in post-modern/avant garde/querzblatz poetics)
upon the
process of writing, and a distaste (that 't' word again) for language as
a product
to be consumed.

On the other hand, this poetics emphasises the reader's role in creating
meaning,
when the reader can (should?) not have access to the writing process. Is
their a
contradiction here, or a division between practitioners & theorists
(even when
contained in the same bod)?

I've tended on the 'result' side when defending my 'tastes' in music.
"How can you
listen to that," my friends say, "it's all made by computers!". I
usually reply that
it doesn't matter to me whether the sounds are created by a vituoso
musician,
programmed by an engineer or conjured from empty space - it all ends up
encoded as
0's and 1's anyway, and the listening experience is what makes it human.

Similarly, I don't think one should care whether a bunch of words arose
from the
heartfelt expression of human emotion, the product of chance operations,
a calculated
fiction or a error in translation. Poetry arises in the reading process.



(Of course, as a writer and musician, I'm intrigued by composition
processes -
knowing about certain unusual production techniques, such as the melody
played by
Casio calculator on Kraftwerk's 'Pocket Calculator', makes a piece more
interesting
to me, although that knowledge is often extrinsic to the music. We all
live with
such contradictions.)

BTW, I liked that MacProse excerpt, but I'm not sure whether I'd have
liked it more
or less if I'd thought that a human had written it.

Having previously announced the demise of Coach House Press, I am now
pleased to announce the (re)birth of Coach House Books. CHB is
associated with some of the founders of CHP who, in its last years,
were no longer associated with it.

According to their newsletter, they'll be publishing two titles a
month in two distinct formats: "limited edition, made-to-order printed
books, and electronic books, on-line, World Wide". If you want one of
the on-line books, you can order it, and they'll print it, bind it and
mail it to you.

The first two books they've listed are _Nicholodeon_ by Darren
Wershler-Henry and _Kiyooka, December-February '87 '88_ with text by
Roy Kiyooka and and monochrome drawings by David Bolduc.

For more information you can subscribe to the newletter by emailing

db chirot, i dig!... and i like the noir/western connection... going back
the other way, tourneur's *out of the past* feels different than most noir
in part b/c he's worked in those western-outdoorsy locales...

let's see---i like the *misfits/tom horn/shootist* trilogy idea, but i
think i'd replace *tom horn* with peckinpah's (presumably butchered in the
editing room) *ride the high country*, seeing as how it was randolph
scott's last film... and an excellent flick, butchered or no...

anyway, as to mcqueen:  much as i enjoy him, *tom horn* is just awful,
no?---and it's his next-to-last flick, i think... *the hunter* was his last
i believe, and this was bad too... as far as westerns, *nevada smith* with
mcqueen was enjoyable, though for me mcqueen = bullit, magnificent seven,
thomas crown, 'doc' in *the getaway* (near-western), and esp. 'the cooler
king' in *the great escape* whose motorcycle stunts put an indelible
imprint on my and my bro's young minds (and hooked us on bikes in
general---so we're back to *easy rider* as a western)...

as to taza:  i always get the 'broken' flicks messed up, *broken arrow* and
*broken lance*... but according to maltin here, *taza, son of cochise* is a
sort of sequel to *broken arrow* (*broken lance* is the one where widmark
gets the knife in his hand---very violent for its time)... still, much as i
like jeff chandler, putting him in native garb doesn't quite work these
days, no?... no doubt didn't work well then, if you were a native... but
ok, times change (thankfully)...

what about that odd charlie bronson pic, *the white buffalo*?... and
speaking of buffalo, one of robert taylor's best performances was in *the
last hunt* (richard brooks)...

i'm thinking, before we go off into 'sons of machiste' and the like (i
know), that perhaps it's worth noting in passing kubrick's tendency to bump
up against the western genre, his final visual in *strangelove* of slim
pickens on that a-bomb, riding it a-rodeo style... and joker's john
wayne-isms in *full metal jacket* (which kali can speak to much better than
me)... though it seems that kubrick has stayed away from the genre
literally...

YEE HAW...

but ok, as to sand & sandal epics:  they used to show those italian
musclemen flicks every sunday morning, and these, along with abbott &
costello, kept me home from sunday school (thank the lord)...

hey, and what about richard brooks' *bite the bullet!?---

but really, when you look over these lists of titles and think of the
films, it really does strike you how much the western has been focused on
men men men men
men men men men//

Dislike of John Wayne is made rather easy with the benefit hindsight: 'Green
Berets' the fact that he named his son after his 'Indian hating' character
in the searchers & John Ford's confessions that he hid the searchers script
from wayne because he thought wayne would not have coped with its leftist
politics.
His all-round jingoism made him a pretty unpopular figure at a time of
strong anti-war protest & revisionist history. However he is an important
figure for both film & cultural studies - not just as a reflection of his
and his characters politics - but the roles he played in a multitude of
films many of which (green berets - excluded) use his persona to address
complex issues that using a less strong character/personality would not have
adressed.

The love/hate thing ties in quite nicely here, his Ethan was a man who
'hated indians' obviously this is a reflection on him rather than a
reflection on 'the indians' & is a feature by which we judge him - and by
which we know where we stand. It is a locator for his character. (In the
green berets he hates another kind of indian).

Any judgements of Wayne (hate/love - violent (or passive) dislike) have to
be tempered by a certain ambivalence:  the usefulness of his character in
19th & 20th century american attitudes makes it difficult to write-off many
of the films he starred in.

Tom,

Destry also features Ms. Dietrich, as the euphemistically dubbed "Frenchie,"
singing "See What The Boys In the Backroom Will Have."

Douglas Sirk is one of the all-time greats! (But I love Max Ophuls more...).
 I've only seen Sirk's classic bourgeois weepies - "All That Heaven Will
Allow," and the remake of "Imitation of Life." Can't remember - did he also
do "Magnificent Obsession?"

Now, as for Jessica Lange & Cheekbone Dunaway - do tell, do tell!

Subject:      More MLA Readings

In addition to the MLA readings mentioned in Mark Wallace's post earlier
today, I wanted to add that Kimiko Hahn, myself, and Heinz Insu Fenkl will be
reading on Sunday, December 29, 5:15-6:30, as session 530 (Holmes Room,
Sheraton Washington).  Although the session is blandly titled "Three Asian
American Writers: A Reading" (we barely got the proposal and our membership
fees in!), I promise you this will be very different from the type of
mainstream multiculturalist Asian American writing (Garrett Hongo, Amy Tan,
etc.) usually offered or discussed at the MLA.
    My partner Juliana Chang will also be speaking on "Jessica Hagedorn's
Poetics of Danger and Desire" in session 587 (Sunday, 9-10:15 pm, Holmes
Room, Sheraton Washington).
    Kimiko's  4 collections include, most notably, _Earshot_ and _Unbearable
Heart_ and her work has appeared in numerous anthologies.  She won the
Theodore Roethke Award last year and an American Book Award this year.  I
will be reading selections from the vast anthology _Premonitions:  An
Anthology of New Asian North American Poetry_ (I will soon be posting a
Poetics-list discount offer for this book), and Heinz, who has written
everything from HBO animation scripts to ribofunk sci-fi novels
(wetware-based post-cyberpunk writing) will be reading from his new
autobiographical novel (and first with a large corporate publisher),
_Memories of My Ghost Brother_ (Dutton, just released), based on his growing
up around a U.S. Army base in South Korea that served as support for the
American forces in Vietnam.  John Yau may also read, depending on whether he
can make it down to DC (John's new collection of prose and poetry, _Forbidden
Entries_, has just been published by Black Sparrow, and his book on Jasper
Johns, _The United States of Jasper Johns_ (Abrams), is due out in a few
weeks.)

Would love to meet any Poetics list members after the reading.

Well, yes and no. Taste is more complex than opinion. And I think it
supports judgements about art works--whether they are westerns, video
installations, tevaevae, or texts by Jackson MacLow--rather more
effectively than 'rigorous standards of analysis and argument.' Given a
choice between 'holding myself'--in an iron like grip--to such standards
and interrogating myself--'confess, confess, collaborator, pig, we know
there are dark structures shaping your tastes, we want NAMES!'--and
exercising my taste, i know what I prefer to be doing.

The problem we have with  'taste' is that it is judgment supported by
class, upper middle usually. Its what snobs have. Its effete. 'Good'
taste is like good manners, and we want to hit on it with our' bad'
taste and tear down the class structure.It is we think  the aesthetics
of modernists (hiss, boo) and formalists too (boo, hiss) and so it has a
bad name.  My question was: might we steal it back?

 For you don't come out of a movie itching to interrogate the structures
which shaped your response, you HAVE a response. When I like something a
lot, its happens fast and that is neither a sign I'm a dumb shit who
makes knee jerk reactions or that I have applied rigorous standards of
analysis and argument to what I have read. Equally, as a practitioner I
cannot afford to consider that all modes of practice, all poetics, have
an equal claim on me; on the contrary.  There are practices out there, ,
whose claims I have dismissed, there are  practices and tastes for them
which would not only deny the claims of my own but which threaten its
existence.  Taste observes an economy in which value judgements play a
vital part, saving time and energy for reading what has to be read and
writing what has to be written.

*Why* is taste "more complex than opinion"?  As far as I can see, this is
just something you're saying.  Where's the there?  *Why* is "taste" more
effective than "rigorous standards of analysis and argument"?

That's a nice rhetorical device you're using, insisting that my prose is as
thuggish as your own, but to pull it off you need to quote me out of
context.  I suggest that refusing to interrogate the *cultural structures*
which contain and shape your taste is a problem; *not* that you should
interrogate yourself (take yourself hostage, force yourself to talk).  At
which point you are left with only the term "rigorous" (since "hold" could
as easily be gentle as rough) to point to, and "rigor," while it lends
itself to some amusing images, is hardly on the level of "violence."

>My question was: might we steal it back?

I don't *think* so.  I mean, there would have to be a back to steal it from,
wouldn't there?   Seems to me that your notion of taste is a wee bit...
nostalgic.  And nostalgia, as we all know, is a longing for an age which
never existed.

> For you don't come out of a movie itching to interrogate the structures
>which shaped your response, you HAVE a response.

Part of my experience of the movie is the interrogation of those structures;
the interrogation and the response are not separable.  I, too, know what I
like, almost immediately.  The difference seems to be that I know *why* I
like it, and  I think it is important to know why I like it.  I also know
when I *don't* like something. If I know *why* I don't like something, I'm
satisfied.  It's when I don't like something and I *don't* know why that the
more lengthy interrogation begins.  What I hear you saying is that "taste
is."  Again, I don't *think* so.  Taste is a product of what we're raised to
accept as "good" (or "bad" if you're feeling rebellious).

>When I like something a

Ummm, so what is it you *are* doing when you like something a lot?

The Lester Thurow of poetics--a zero-sum aesthetic economy.  Or Social
Darwinism--survival of the most fit aesthetic.  A poet's gotta do what a
poet's gotta do... not to mention he's gotta preserve his vital textual
fluids, which could be sapped--sapped I tell you!--by the weaker aesthetes.
Who said that all poetics have an equal claim on you?  Not me; that's a
straw person.  All I've said is that there are different aesthetics,
different modes of practice, and that it's useful to take the time to
understand them, and to judge a work in the context in which it was created.
It always amazes me how much this claim annoys some people.  Right/wrong
good/bad like it/don't like it... go right ahead and choose your dichotomy.
Take two, they're small.  One size fits all.  Me, I'm gonna listen to Trane
and Ice T, Callas and Cab Calloway, Pauline Oliveras and Sonny Terry, Ian
Dury, Aster Awake, *and* Laurie Anderson.  No problem. I'm flexible.  And I
know what I like.

Not strictly poetics, but I think there's lots of meat here; it
also opens questions similar to those I've tried to raise on
the interface of poetry/poetics and new media/consumer/aesthetics.

Dan Salmon refers to "dislike of John Wayne" which was pretty general
and makes political sense given his Green Berets (truly a terrible
movie) and "his all-round jingoism."

Dan then goes on to concede that he is "an important figure for both
film and cultural studies - not just as a reflection of his
and his characters politics - but the roles he played in a multitude
offilms ... use his persona to address complex issues that using a less
strong character/personality would not haveadressed."

That's an acute distinction between Wayne as a carrier of cultural
significance (writing bad or good, to borrow from another thread) and
the significance of his ability to carry these meanings. He was an
extraordinary artist. I don't admire his politics, but they should not
be confounded with someone like Ronald Reagan either. That is, they
were not a stage for carrying anything out beyond forcing out a couple
of really poor films.

In particular, Dan cites his naming a son Ethan -- the name of the
Indian-hating character Wayne played in The Searchers. Surely this
confounds the role and the real a little too directly. Or, rather,
assumes that the actor did confound them.

Yet, I think perhaps Ford's 'leftism' may be as good a model as any for
Wayne's 'rightism.' Unless and until seen through the work, it really
didn't amount to much. Seen through the work, it is mostly interesting
for its relation to that work. In that relation, it is not an
unconscious fact but it is one which is being played in and against the
roles with great power and shape.

Take a look at Darick Chamberlain's "mock machine mock epic"
_Cigarette Boy_, which is not a machine generated text but is
designed to appear so; processes are on display, codes are
revealed. It's interesting work and deserves to be better known.

There's an online version at http://www.qinet.com/zaius/Cig1.htm
but it was originally a print text; I'm waiting on a copy from
Darick and if others are interested will post more when it
arrives.

If you ever visit Old Tucson, the movie town west of Tucson, you then
recognize it's little conical hill in a lot of old westerns. I hear that
Old Tucson burnt down last year but that it is being rebuilt. You can also
go there and see guys having (I think) mock gunfights, falling off roofs,
etc. For a Canadian, very exciting, all those guns and all.

Hey Maria, some of my relatives used to be USAmericans, and I still feel
that way. Whenever I am in the US I always feel as if I could get shot any
time. I mean, when US tourists cross into Canada they get bewildered and
angry when told they have to leave their ordinance at the border. How will
we protect ourselves, they demand to know.

It was going to be published this Fall by Coach House. When CHP failed, it

It's called _Taken_, and is kind of a prequel to _Ana Historic_.

Kali,
In your latest reply to Wystan, you write:

Why?  A problem for whom, or for what?

And further:

Mike Boughn gave Olson as an example; no doubt Wystan had in mind the
sort of tastes Pound expressed in his programmatic prose, "violent
narrow tastes" maybe, maybe not.  Do either of these idiosyncratic
aesthetics strike you as products of what Olson or Pound were raised to
accept as good?  Or even as simple rebellions against same?

When you write

> All I've said is that there are different aesthetics, different modes of
> practice, and that it's useful to take the time to understand them, and to
> judge a work in the context in which it was created.

some of this should go without saying, of course, but a lot will depend
on what kind of spin "context" is given.  Is it determinative?
Sentences like "Taste is a product of what we're raised to accept ..."
make me a little suspicious that context is being treated as if it were
something it isn't.  A lot of people these days have read enough Derrida
to be real interested in a work's context, but not enough to know how
problematic the whole idea is and how little it explains.  Does Olson's
upbringing explain his "taste"?  Does Wystan's?

I think we have a serious problem here.  I've been thinking on & off for
days about what Maria Damon says, that she's interested in the "cultural
work" (just a quote, not a scare-quote) done by a work.  That made me a
little nervous, because I would hate to see a poem treated more as a
source in a project for writing the history of the present than as,
well, a poem.  You can do that; you can read Dickens in a history class
too, and that's one way to approach a work, mining it for information --
but I'd hate to see that confused with something else (which goes
nameless here since I can' think how to characterize it).

But I'm sure I can live with Maria's idea, construed any number of ways.
Olson damn sure thought he was doing cultural work, Pound too.  There's
a number of ways to look at this.  What I'm not sure I can accept is the
version you present here, Kali, the impersonal machinery of history
molding our tastes -- and probably our art too?  All we can do is
interrogate the structures -- within which we are constrained?
Prisoners mapping the panopticon?

That's a bit over-the-top perhaps.  But of all things, art is always
going to have an irreducible residuum of individuality that should give
the lie to this sort of simplification.  Aren't you really hypostatizing
these cultural structures?  What happens when you get down to cases?  Is
it writer against cultural structure or writer against editor?  (Maria?
Which was it?)  I know what Foucault said -- "People know what they do,
most people even know why they do what they do, but what they don't know
is what what they do does."  But it is still the individual actor, and
treating the aggregate patterns of people's behaviours as real things in
themselves will always miss the trees for the forest.  It's like a
gambler's fallacy -- you think the odds must be in your favour after
rolling the dice for three days straight, when the odds for the
individual throw are the same every time, no matter what probability
says.  Confusion of levels.

Which brings me back to the question at the top: who cares what Wystan
(ours or history's) thinks? or Olson? or Pound?  As Mike said, and as
Wystan has indicated, the thinking is tied up with finding a way to
create something -- these guys aren't legislating anything.  They're not
laying down any laws for society.  You seem to see them all, Kali, as
would-be Secretaries of the Interior, deciding who gets what forests
where, with what trees, and what use to be made of them, etc.  But
they're not manipulating cultural structures per se -- nobody can,
that's the whole point.  (The emergence of confinement as the principal
form of punishment just happened -- nobody did it, says Michel.)  Pound
& Olson & Wystan & Mike & you & I participate in whatever will one day
turn out to have happened.  Enough of that -- the point is thinking only
in terms of the aggregates, the cultural structures, has this sort of
twin danger of treating individuals as powerless (the usual complaint
against Foucault) or as somehow all-powerful, as if Wystan's taste and
how he got it was a problem, a danger.  And that's a confusion of
levels, trees and forests, gamblers and odds.

Sorry if in chopping up your post I have misrepresented you -- or if
I've done so in some other fashion.  I've put some words in your mouth,
certainly, but only to hash this out a little.  Feel free to restore
whatever subtlety I have shorn away from your position.

I've always enjoyed Jacques Servin's delicate, elegant word play.
Do any of the rest of you know his writing?

In addition to being a witty stylist, Jacques is also an expert
C ++ programmer. Last month, Jacques made CD-ROM history by
programming homoerotic acts into SIMCOPTER, a mass-market game
that shipped before the company (which also makes SIMCITY) managed
to notice. _Wired_ and a few other mags will be doing articles on
this. If you're going to quit your job, J. told me, you might as
well mutate society in the process.

I also recommend The Black Tower among Siegel's late films (or is it
the Black Windmill -- it's almost never on the movie channels and I
hadn't thought of it in years)

Also Telefon -- if I'd taken the job with Siegel, I believe this would
have been the first film I'd have worked on.

The Beguiled is scarily delightful. Other than to say it's a Civil War
film, I think it'd be best not to compromise the experience with
pre-description.

Tom

...and then there's the treatment I sent Siegel a month or so later...
doubtful I could lay my hands on it, however. Vague recollection of it
being like Andre Schwarz-bart meets Tom Tryon -- final scene taking
place in a burning house in Jerusalem.

I just wanted quickly to disagree with Kevin over Costner's Earp,
which I thought much more interesting than Tombstone, precisely
because of the overload of details which added to it's epic qualities.
Maybe that's the difference--Tomstone went for the "mythic"
(archetypal narrative) whereas Wyatt Earp went for the "epic" (if you
think the details in the movie were bad, I guess you don't much care
for the catalog of ships in the Iliad).

I don't know of any other treatment of the story that so emphasizes
the Earp's as businessmen for whom the policing was just a way to
bring in some cash till their family enterprises got going. My Darling
Clementine, for all it's visual beauty, was laughable in terms of it's
treatment of the narrative details of the legend.

Anyway, Dennis Quaid was much better as Doc Holliday than Val Kimer.

matt thanks for the gary chapman post, which was certainly true but not
especially original nor profound analytically; the Birmingham school folks like
Paul Willis, Stuart Hall, Angela McRobbie et al have been saying this for over
twenty years.  And WEB Du Bois before them,etc.  i've been wrestling with some
of these issues in the poetry realm, hence my favorite trope the dark end of the
street and its many suggestive layerings.  i did back channel "the poem" that
had been the subject of such a crisis to one person last week and he responded
by saying, "it's amazing that the cultural critics haven't gotten hold of this
kind of material."  it was very, excuse the jargon, validating (thank you
victor) but also ironic, because i *am* one of those cultural critics and i
*have* gotten hold of this material and dont wanna let go, it's my lifeblood,
and i have a great deal of trouble getting people to take seriously what i do.
cultural studies people think poetry is elitist (cuz it was used on them as an
instrument of torture in elementary school?) and poetry people think cultural
studies is cold opportunistic sociology whose sole function is to "reduce" the
poem to secondary evidence for some sociological banality.  these sound like
caricatures, but i encounter these roadblocks constantly in responses to
manuscripts, talks, paper proposals etc.  by the way things have worked out
pretty well w/ that article.  the poem and my analysis of it, with an
explanatory note, will appear as a footnote. so, forward ever backward never
etc.  --maria d

Well sure, Maria, but not in the context of electronic media.
In fact, the sort of work suggested by the names you invoke
above is all but non-existent in that field. As for "coolness"
have a look at Alan Liu's taxonomy on his "Laws of the Cool"
page (off of humanitas.ucsb.edu); it's convincing on the point
that the word has evolved (or accumulated) significantly from
its earlier uses.

Well, I was happy to see, finally, that someone remembered that Clint
Eastwood had directed so fine westerns (I really like _The Outlaw Josie
Wales_), but was especially intrigued by the comments on Steve McQueen:

Subject: Re: more on westerns

anyway, as to mcqueen:  much as i enjoy him, *tom horn* is just awful,
no?---and it's his next-to-last flick, i think... *the hunter* was his last
i believe, and this was bad too... as far as westerns, *nevada smith* with
mcqueen was enjoyable, though for me mcqueen = bullit, magnificent seven,
thomas crown, 'doc' in *the getaway* (near-western), and esp. 'the cooler
king' in *the great escape* whose motorcycle stunts put an indelible
imprint on my and my bro's young minds (and hooked us on bikes in
general---so we're back to *easy rider* as a western)..."

I have to confess that it was McQueen in b&w, for half an hour each week
that left 'an indelible imprint' on my young mind. There were a couple of
those shows that were truly surreal.

I do think it kinda intriguing that these two threads havent quite joined
up yet, as from the outside, all the commentary on westerns does seem to
demonstrate the ways in which 'taste' signs personal response, & also
suggests how that can happen in a variety of sites. I think it's terrific
to see so many poets etc really getting involved in remembering not just
the well-known films but the hidden treasures like _Johnny Guitar_, a truly
wild film.
Although I found Wystan's posting provocative & entertaining, I do tend to
think that it's possible to make choices about 'good' & 'bad' within a
variety of forms, types, kinds, but very dangerous to dismiss a 'kind' out
of hand, although for each of us there are probably certain kinds that
simply dont connect. But I like to think I can tell who really makes it in
jazz as well as c&w, not to mention certain other kinds of music or writing
or... (& I suspect a lot on here like to think the same of themselves...)

Last night, after enjoying the thread on cowboy flicks while gnawing on
the last of the left-over turkey, I came across the following in an
interview with Michel Butor (anyone still read him? Some of the last
books are in fact quite extraordinary!) that appeared in *Liberation*
(Nov. 14 96):

Q: Could one read *Gyroscope* (Butor's latest book, with rather
interesting/wild decentered layout -- texts trying to imnitate the
concept sof the gyroscope) on the Internet:

Michel Butor: Internet is a labyrinthian figure full of dangers where
one can get lost and be devoured. It is a region without law, a place of
pillage, the country of "outlaws." (in English in the text) It is very
exciting but it can't last very long. International legislation is
urgently needed. It will take a long time because liberalism is very
powerful at the end of this century. For the time being it is the domain
of various mafias, just as in the beginning the "Far West" (in Englsih
in the text) belonged to the gangsters. Fortunately, there are also
pioneers who are setting up inhabitable areas

well, speaking of stuart hall and pop-culture cultural studies:

just rec'd in the mail the other day (any of you receive same?) a fold-out
full-color flyer with a large pic of stuart hall's HEAD as backdrop and
with the following across the front:

Stuart Hall

On
Representation

two VIDEO presentations

Representation
and the Media

Race, the
Floating Signifier

open it up and you get a high-pitched sales pitch pitched presumably to
teachers---

"Hall clarlifies many of cultural studies' central ideas such as:  the
centrality of culture and meaning in human society, the role of language
and communication in meaning, and the relationship between reality and
discourse."

this in the "introductory lecture" from the first video (above)... whereas
the second video is

"Pitched [no shit] at an advanced level -- suitable for upper-level classes
as well as graduates and faculty -- *Race, the Floating Signifer* advances
a theoretically radical argument about how racism depends upon its
*discursive* construction to accomplish its destructive function of
classification, exclusion and repression."

there are little snapshots in the flyer, with hall's gloss (e.g., a still
of vivien leigh and hattie mcdaniel from *gone with the wind* with the
gloss, "It is the body which became the totemic object, the very visibility
of the evident articulation or linkage between nature and culture.")...

and there are little blurbs, offset in little multicolored rectangular
boxes, writ by those enthusiastic about the video... i excerpt:

"Everyone, everywhere in the world, needs to hear Stuart Hall's words.  His
understanding of race, class and gender is broad, complex and illuminating.
In this insightful video he brings together theory and practice, offering
new political visions and insights on race that challenge and transform."

                bell hooks, Distinguish Prof. of English, CUNY

"This is a marvelous opportunity to see Stuart Hall in action -- he is a
major force in the fields of communication and cultural studies.  He is
more than engaging, he is *spellbinding*."

                Ellen Wartella, Dean, College of Communication, UT/Austin


the videos ain't cheap---they're $195 for one, with discounts for more than
one...

ok:  now clearly i'm engaged here in *representing*, and just as clearly
i'm having problems with this entire SHOW... for one, to claim that hall is
"spellbinding" is to somewhat miss the point --- or is it? --- of
interrogating representation... there would seem to be little in the way of
reflexiveness on the part of those who put together this representation of
hall representing, or am i simply to assume that we're all, hall as well,
stuck in the marketplace and should therefore wallow in it?---which, as
i've said in an earlier post, is one of the liabilities of certain
tendencies in cultural studies...

but even more:  this is being "pitched" to instructors, by way of
instruction, and here i'd say that we're in the domain of distance
education/learning, and how video technologies can usurp the site of
instruction... it's not that such videos can't be useful, it's just that
it's easy to see how they might NOT be---esp. in light of the
representational blindness of the promotional flyer... i wonder who
owns/runs "the foundation for media education" (our of northampton, ma)?...
"video resources for the 21st century"?... presumably watching such videos
will instill in us (YUCK) the idea (to excerpt from the paraphrase they
provide of hall's thinking) "that cultural studies can contest the
stereotypes (gender, racial, sexual) offered up by the media by getting
'inside' the image, and subjecting the process of representation to a
fierce *analytical interrogation* with the aim of making the stereotypes
'uninhabitable'"...

whether my "interrogation" has been fierce or not, i'm not in a position to
say... but i *can* say that subjecting the flyer itself to such logic
rather unravels the further stereotypes of teaching and of video marketing,
respectively... i'll leave it to others to decode the flyer in terms of its
representation of hall himself---who hails from jamaica, no?...

The book's inscriptions (are supposed to be indicative):

Yizhong always appreciates my ink sketches of bamboo. But I paint bamboo
simply for the love of it, no other reason. Why should I trouble myself
with whether what I do is true to the form of a real plant ... Often I've
daubed and smeared for a time, and when someone sees the results they take
it for hemp or rushes. If I can't convince myself that it's bamboo I've
painted, how am I going to convince anyone else? I just don't know what it
is that Yizhong sees.

with a sponge and a rusty spanner.
                - Stephen Morrissey


Zhuangzi and Hui Shi were strolling along a bridge over the Hao River.
'See how happy and carefree the fish are,' said Zhuangzi, 'as they swim about.'
'You're not a fish. How do you know that they're happy?'
'You're not me. How do you know that I don't.'
'OK, I don't. And if you concede that you're not a fish, then you'll admit
that you have no idea about their happiness.'
'Wait a minute. When you asked me how I knew, you already implied that,
somehow, I did know,' said Zhuangzi. 'I know what I know from above the
Hao.'
                - Translated and construed from
                     Zhuangzi, 17 ('The Autumn Floods').

[Translator's note: When he recalled this conversation later in life,
Zhuangzi was unable to tell whether the pleasure it gave him arose from his
memory of the fishes' happiness or from the free and easy pleasure he
always felt when walking and talking with his more language-orientated
companions.]


And a sample adaptation (from about p. 30), after Wang Wei:

Am I alone?
I seem to hear your voice ...
     - or echo?

I point out, as if to you,
     the ancient light
   which makes the mosses glow.

   So we return
   each evening
   to this hillside
   through the deep wood.

i think there *is* a conceptual (and fully affective) intersection, so to
speak, twixt individual agency and sociocultural constraint... i think this
is what patrick is getting at...

kali seems to me to be trying to hold out against more connoisseur-driven
notions of taste... wystan seems to me to be holding out against reduction
of writerly (or readerly, i suppose) impulses to deterministic
sociocultural machinery... surely we can speak across this divide?...

or perhaps NOT speak... that is, there would seem to be some value here in
understanding how silence plays a role in these distinctions...

i might put it another way...

i might not!...

but ok:  not to turn this into a religious controversy, but after reading
parts of rorty's and bloom's and lentricchia's latest diatribes on
literature's inspirational values, i'm willing to concede this much:  that
there are corresponding acts of faith associated with coming to the
alphabet, to any meaning-making enterprise... i don't mean blind faith, or
(necessarily---and certainly not for me) faith in some transcendental
reality... but i do believe that there is a faith situated just behind or
beneath or above or beyond or on the side of [gasp] our beliefs... seems to
me that this, too, is as much sociocultural as individual... but that it
works at a meta-level, is often so tacit in what we say, or don't say, that
it forms a sort of invisible glue that holds our thoughts and words
together---for ourselves, anyway... i trust i'm not waxing too
post-romantic here...

anyway, don't know if this helps, mebbe it only confuses matters more...
but for me, there is the necessity at times to invoke, as much as a
collective state of affairs, a place of solitude... ergo my refusal to let
go of a sense of place, however...

best,

joe

Good news on the day they discovered ice on the moon: a copy of a
longish (16 pages) poem by Blaise Cendrars called "The legend of
Novgorod" & published in an edition of 14 copies in Moscow in 1907 under
his real name (Frederic Sauser) has just been found in a secondhand
bookstore in Sofia. It will be published in France by Fata Morgana with
a preface by Cendrars daughter, Miriam Cendrars. Ron Padgett, to work!

Good for you George! It's Budd Boetticher and he's a very underrated Western
auteur. Haven't seen "The Tall T" yet but I hear it's one of the best.
Didn't he also do "Ride Lonesome" with Randolph Scott?

Hi,

I've enjoyed the discussion concerning the CW PhD, and I thought I'd try
to provide some small insight as a poet pursuing such a degree; I'm
currently working on a PhD with a creative dissertation in the English
Dept at Texas Tech University, after earning an MFA from Sarah Lawrence.

First, I'd like to challenge the academy/"real world" dichotomy that Burt
asserts. The assumption seems to be that those of us in the academy are
trying to avoid the difficulties of life, when in actuality we're throat-deep
in them. As Ron pointed out, being a graduate teaching assistant ain't
exactly easy. And being involved in a university setting does not
(necessarily) insulate one from the struggle to publish. I know of no writer
enrolled in a graduate program who is not actively pursuing publication
(shameless self-promotion: check out two of my poems in the forthcoming issue
of Faultline, for instance). Also, perhaps ironically, my work in the
university setting puts me in contact with many more non-"professional"
writers (my students) than I suspect would be the case if my community
were, say, the Nuyorican crowd. Working with farm kids, first-generation
Chicano students, etc., puts me closer in touch with "the real world"
than I would be otherwise. So the idea that the academy is some kind of
golden bubble is just wrong. At least here in West Texas, the University
is the only place where the most diverse elements of the real world all
come together.

A scam? Maybe. I'm here doing this because it's a living, I'm close to
what I love (literature and writing), I'm getting some teaching
experience (which is valuable in itself, whether I go on to a teaching
career or not), and I have the time and support I need to put together my
first collection. Also, and I think this is quite important, I just want
a PhD. It's a goal, like publishing that first collection by the time I
turn 30, that I want to achieve, just because it's as far as I can go
academically. It's a challenge, like running a marathon. And I make no
apologies for wanting to tackle it.

The pitfalls, of course, are those involved in CW instruction generally:
prescriptive pedagogy, emphasis on the conventional, etc. But for the grad
student/writer who is aware of these pitfalls, and who is plugged-in to the
wider poetic community, they are not so difficult to avoid. A little
personal integrity goes a long way.

Anyway, those are my two cents....

Hi Manny,

It was Theodor Adono who said "After Auschwitz, all poetry is barbaric." But
that's a paraphrase (I think). I, too, would like the source of this quote,
if anybody knows it.

That, manny, was Theodor Adorno who claimed that after Auschwitz it was
no longer possible to write poetry (in fact, lets not be lazy & go to
the shelves & locate the excat quote -- yes, here it is on the final
page of the essay "Cultural Criticism and Society"( p. 34 of _Prisms_
MIT press 1988): "To write poetry after Auschwitz is barbaric. And this
corrodes even the knowledge of why it has become impossible to write
poetry today." Of course, by that time Celan had already written the
TODESFUGE, and in the camps themselves, people wrote poetry -- H.G.
Adler comes to mind, off hand.

The usual translation of Adorno's line is "No poetry after Auschwitz".

Adorno said this--or similar versions--in a number of places.  To hand,
'Cultural Criticism and Society' in _Prisms_ trans. by Samuel and Shierry
Weber (Cambridge, Mass.: MIT Press, 1990; first publd. 1967), page 34:
'Cultural criticism finds itself faced with the final stage of the
dialectic of culture and barbarism.  To write poetry after Auschwitz is
barbaric.  And this corrodes even the knowledge of why it has become
impossible to write poetry today.  Absolute reification which presupposed
intellectual progress as one of its elements, is now preparing to absorb
the mind entirely.  Critical intelligence cannot be equal to this
challenge as long as it confines itself to self-satisfied contemplation.'

Adorno did reconsider his famous statement in "Cultural Criticism
and Society," most strikingly in the following passage from the
section of _Negative Dialectics_ called "After Auschwitz":

Perennial suffering has as much right to expression as a
tortured man has to scream; hence it may have been wrong
to say that after Auschwitz you could no longer write
poems.  But it is not wrong to raise the less cultural
question whether after Auschwitz you can go on living--
especially whether one who escaped by accident, one who by
rights should have been killed, may go on living.  His mere
survival calls for the coldness, the basic principle of
bourgeois subjectivity, without which there could have been
no Auschwitz; this is the drastic guilt of him who was
spared.  (362-63)

And a few pages later:

All post-Auschwitz culture, including its urgent critique,
is garbage.  In restoring itself after the things that
happened without resistance in its own countryside, culture
has turned entirely into the ideology it had been potentially--
had been ever since it presumed, in opposition to material
existence, to inspire that existence with the light denied
it by the separation of mind from manual labor.  Whoever
pleads for the maintenance of this radically culpable and
shabby culture becomes its accomplice, while the man who says
no to culture is directly furthering the barbarism which our
culture showed itself to be.  (367)

This is a bit reductive, Aldon, tho Wystan's introduction of the word
"taste" certainly leaves his argument open to your criticism. My own
sense is that beneath the diction is a proposal along the lines of
what Olson argues in _Special View of History_ and elsewhere (I think
in the piece on history in _Muthologos_) as the difference between
Thucydides and Herodotus--the "objective" reporting of "events" or
what Olson loved to translate from 'istorin--to find out for oneself.

        There should be many more such manuscripts. Cendrars frequntly
alluded to mysterious trunks and bundles of his writing hidden the world
over.  (Isn't it in Brazil where there are supposedly concealed twelve
volumes of a certain work . . . )
        UCal P has a good book out of Cendrars' Hollywood writings--
        although as another well known rapscallion might warn those quick
to doubt the words of M. Blaise:
        "honi soit qui mal y pense"
        from l'Or--made into Sutter's Gold--directed by James Cruze--who
also did the classic Covered Wagon:
        " The trail stretches for thousands of miles.  Strung along it at
intervals of a hudred miles are wooden forts . . . Their garrisons are
continually on the alert. War with the Redskins is a war of atrocities.
No quarter!  Woe to the hapless party that falls into an ambuscade of the
scalp hunters.  Suter has no hesitation.  Mounted on his mustang, Wild
Bill, he gallops in the van of his concoy, whistling an air from The
Carnival of Basle between his teeth.  His memory gos back to the little
urchin at Runenberg to whom he had given his last thaler. He reins in his
horse.  'Heads or tails'.  The doubloon spins towards heaven like a
mounting lark.  Heads to win.  Tals to lose.  It falls flat upon his open
palm.  Heads!  He spurs his horse forwards, full of a new confidenc.
This was his first hesitation.  It will be his last.  From now
on--forward to the goal . . .
        "All that Suter has gained in four years of American life is this
half-breed circus dog who walks on his hind legs and smokes a pipe with
the sailors."
        A good double feature:  Sutter's Gold with von Stroheim's GREED

Subject:      taste, writing, and the tools of the master

i've been following the taste thread with great interest for a pretty
obvious reason, but i'll state it anyway: at 35 yrs old, i've had an
absolute, unshakeable opinion of the awfulness of something in fact,
shaken, enough times that i do, as kali states, want very much to know
WHY i like, or don't like something.

one thing i've found true disconcertingly often is that when i
don't like something, and don't know quite why, it is because the work
sounds like something i myself wrote a while back, or even, horrors,
recently.  and now i'm hearing it from the outside, it is WRONG WRONG
WRONG and if i admit that explicitly, why it is wrong, etc., then i
have to admit i wrote something dopey and god help us all, i might even
have published it.

admit it.  you ALL know EXACTLY what i am talking about, the 2 a.m
horrors when you say "oh my god, every single poem in that magazine
was thoroughly dreadful for X reason, and my poem fit RIGHT IN!

ACKKHHHGHGHGHGHHHHHH!!!!

ok, that skeleton is out of closet.

here comes the next.  sometimes, i read a poem or short story and get
restless and bored and irritated because i can't follow it.  this has
happened with enough certified "greats" (all right, you want names oh
interrogator, here: faulkner.  yes, i am one of those people who can't
stand reading faulkner.  nabokov.  mailer (oh, he is SUCH a chauvanist
turd i take that back.  it is PERFECTLY understandable not to be able to
stand his writing.  the executioners song was a fluke).  finnegan's wake)
that i just accept that my "taste," i.e. "what i like," is not infallible.

also, sometimes if i am trying hard, and ask around, i'll find something
someone says that can help me open up to what i am having trouble reading.
as with crime and punishment, joyce's ulysses, poems of richard hugo and
Elizabeth Bishop.

but to the meat of this too-long post, my most prominent day-to-day
struggle with "taste" occurs in my work as editor and reader-of-poetry-
for-friends.  i work with a journal.  the current issue has, for me,
seven YES! 's (one a YES YES!), three UCK's, and four OK's.  now,
we've had issues where every single thing in it is a YES from my
standpoint.  only, i'm an assistant editor here; my editor has a
standpoint that is close to, but not always, my own.  and our readers
have standpoints.  and the poetics list has standpoints, as do my
"writer/literature" friends (friends who write, or anyway, read), all
of whom stand in a chorus behind me interrogating MY TASTE as well
they should because on occasion they've made me open my tribe of
"in-my-taste" up.  (ps. kali, re choice of examples, i chose opera and
classical music (mostly) because it helped make the example clearer,
not because i think classical practitioners (be it of music, dance,
etc) are the only only possible "virtuosos."  after all, the
chieftans, whom i mention to illustrate that within the class of
"virtuoso" there are other than classical practioners, are an irish
folk/instrumental band and as blazingly good, i.e. virtuosos, as a BSO
musician.  clearly the mixup was, however, a flaw in my example-giving
process).

in my everyday, there are some works we get submitted to the magazine
that i just plain hate (the works, not necessarily (though sometimes)
the authors) because they are amateurish, clumsily manipulative,
arrogant in their cramming in of big latinate words and literary
references while at the same time making really foolish, give-away
mistakes (i think of these as the school of "if i use enough big,
intimidating words and references, no one will actually parse out the
poem well enough to realize that i can't string together a thought or
phrase, much less an original thought or phrase" writers.  boy they
piss me off.), and/or hallmark-y sentimental.  and, nods to kali, i
KNOW just why i don't like them.  i don't like things that are
claiming, by being sent out for publication (often accompanied by
letters demanding recognition) to be something they are not (skillful,
thoughtful, worked at, crafted (sorry joe, if there was a better word
i'd use it -- well made sounds too like the urn), dense,
knowledge-based -- knowledge which can come from academia, normal
life, and a wide and possibly idiosyncratic course of reading).

sometimes, though, even when i know why i hate something (X author is
a chauvinist, macho pig or Y author keeps using the word "[word]" in
all their poems), the actual writing is good -- the writer has done
alot of interesting things even if i hate their viewpoint, or if i
make myself take each poem on its individual, not-connected-to
anything-i-know-about-author-or-author's-work, reading, it is
well-written.  and so on.

point is, a magazine with some works in i'm not crazy about might not
be a bad thing.  i suspect i might well have "violent narrow taste"
and that something i hate now, i might be able to like in a few
months, or years.  i also like the sense of community, where not every
voice is saying the things i want said the way i want them said.  i DO
draw a line at rotten writing in the magazine (hallmark-y; poems that
use phrases and images from a million other bad poems without any idea
that they aren't original; god help us the poems that will, by any
means necessary, rhyme -- if i NEVER AGAIN read the two words "dew"
and "you" coupled with stumbling meter in a poem it will be too
soon!!!).  i help produce a magazine, a finite space, thus there must
be some narrowing out.

i still argue with myself over WHY i didn't -- or DID -- like various
movies or poems or short stories.  as a writer, i know i stumble
hardest and write from the smallest, least productive hole, when i
dismiss works and don't try to make sure i know what and why i'm
dismissing.

which brings me to a long-ago expressed opinion, again valid here.
there exists such a rich cumulative load of literature, at the same
time as a typically patriarchal emphasis on "mastering" text -- all
text, every single last quivering paragraph and semicolon.  the two
combine into a lethal critical approach i call the criticism of
dismissal.  if texts can be dismissed ("oh, X author is one of the
Z's, too obsessed with result at the expense of process/with the
continuity of history as opposed to the dialogue of the
historical/blah blah blah") then the dismisser, the MASTER, does not
have to read them, or know them.  in other words, since no
loud-talking MASTER of text can possibly have read every single work
of literature since the beginning of preservation of texts (nor can
anyone else, master or not), if one wants to adopt the pose of MASTER
of the text universe, one must come up with some ground clearing
expedient.  the criticism of dismissal is just such an expedient.

of course, both bring into question "taste" -- but i'm questioning
not so much the criteria used for "taste" as the motivation.

wish i could remember exactly (though i know that the irony is that it's

Yah, Primo Levi wrote Holocaust poetry too.  And I'd forgotten it was
Adorno who said that it was impossible to write poetry after the
Holocaust.  When I was researching the section of my book which deals with
Holocaust literature/criticism, though, I was amazed at how many of the
Holocaust writers alternated between feeling compelled to write about
their experiences and feeling that it was absolutely impossible to write
about their experiences.  The Rosenfeld volume I mentioned contains a
number of references to this dilemma.

Ah, the alphabet.  As the mom of dyslexic -- faith, you bet.  Also, out
there in philosophy-of-language-land, theories about alphabet as
alienating, intrinsically.  See, e.g., David Abram's The Spell of the

Dennis Quaid better as Doc Holiday than Val Kilmer? To quote a phrase of
Kevin's: "you are tragically wrong." But hey, it's just a Western, ain't it?

I understand what you're saying about Costner's "Urp," but I think the
filmmaker's intentions must be taken into account when weighing Costner
contra Ford. Ford is really only concerned with myth, with sacred history,
and reality for him finishes a distant second place. I always had a problem
with the OK Corral shootout, for instance, in Ford's pic - it seems sloppy,
not very tight in terms of spatial coordinates of the combatants, etc. Yet
the last time I saw it (a few weeks ago) I found my old complaint withering.
The tension of the scene and its satisfactions derive more from the ritual
of the fight than with the usual chase/suspense theatrics. In this sense, it
has more in common with something like classical Japanese drama (though
admittedly that's a stretch since I don't know beans about Noh or Kabuki).

I find Nietzche's categories useful (from _Use & Abuse of History_): the
monumental, or mythic (Ford), the antiquarian, and the critical or ironic
(the last two being Costner's Earp). Costner & Kasdan (the director) were
deliberately trying to debunk/revise the Earp myth, which all started with a
1931 book called "Wyatt Earp: Frontier Marshall." I can't remember if they
showed this in the film, but the real Earp eventually moved to LA and was
arrested for a variety of bunco schemes c.1909. None of them were nice guys
and evidently were in the law & order biz only as way of protecting their
gambling interests. But Ford was aware of this mythologizing process, too,
as he showed in "Liberty Valance."

Best,
Patrick Pritchett

I just wanted quickly to disagree with Kevin over Costner's Earp,
which I thought much more interesting than Tombstone, precisely
because of the overload of details which added to it's epic qualities.
Maybe that's the difference--Tomstone went for the "mythic"
(archetypal narrative) whereas Wyatt Earp went for the "epic" (if you
think the details in the movie were bad, I guess you don't much care
for the catalog of ships in the Iliad).

I don't know of any other treatment of the story that so emphasizes
the Earp's as businessmen for whom the policing was just a way to
bring in some cash till their family enterprises got going. My Darling
Clementine, for all it's visual beauty, was laughable in terms of it's
treatment of the narrative details of the legend.

Anyway, Dennis Quaid was much better as Doc Holliday than Val Kimer.

As soon as this thread was raised I thought of Primo Levi, and this last
sentence reminds me of the bewilderment (no, not strong enough: try
'despair') I felt upon hearing of Levi's suicide. He had given me hope
that writing can sometimes heal without forgetting, that his understated
style (which heightened the horror without resorting to sensationalism)
helped him to cope and understand.

Was it the 'drastic guilt' that Adorno mentioned that killed him? I
haven't read anything that 'explains' why he ended his life - does
anyone have any insights?

It was the other Wystan (Auden) who made the distinction between taste and
judgment and allowed as how the former should not impede the latter. I may
not be enthralled with say, _Naked Lunch_, but if I'm not, I ought not to
let my distaste for it affect my judgment of its accomplishments (or lack
thereof). Similarly, my affection for a work shouldn't blind me to its
aesthetic/political/cultural faults, as for instance with the recently
stated liking by some, myself included, for John Wayne. Inversely, my wife
can't abide Frank Sinatra b/c he was (is) such a nasty little shit to
people. I understand, but I still say it's her loss.

Patrick Foley asks for whom or for what is it a problem when people refuse
to interrogate the cultural structures which contain and shape their
tastes.

It's traditionally a problem for oppressed minorities when the members of
the majority culture refuse to interrogate those cultural structures.
It's also a problem for working class cultures when elites refuse to do
it.  It's a problem for women when men refuse to do it.  In other words,
"taste" is usually determined and enforced by people with the power to
determine and enforce it.  The "taste economy"--as wystan puts it--is
controlled by the taste capitalists, those who have control of the means
of taste production (publishing industries, film industries, art
industries).  One can either have tastes which conform to the defined
norms of "good" and "bad," or one can rebel against those norms, but it's
impossible to imagine taste which is not influenced by those norms one way
or another (unless one postulates some "essential" or "inherent" standards
of judgement which people are born with).

And, if wystan had in mind the sort of tastes Pound expressed--"violent
narrow tastes," well, that doesn't seem to me a good example of the sort
of taste that is *not* related to a distinct set of cultural values.  Can
you count Pound's politics as unrelated to his poetry?  I can't.

I don't use Derrida (and so I don't think I count as one of the folks who
misconstrues his idea of context).  Context, to me, is the location of a
work on a variety of axes.  I draw my ideas of context from the feminist
and African Americanist theorists--Joan Cocks, Barbara Johnson, Mary Helen
Washington, and so on.  They argue that nothing is ever "one thing at a
time," but is always "many things at once."  This means that when I read a
poem, I care about the form of the poem, the content of the poem, the
manner in which the poem refers to or signifies upon other texts, the
background of the author, the voiced intent of the author, the way the
author is read by others, the historical context in which the poem is
written, the manner in which it is packaged and produced, and on and on.
This is hardly an insistance on the "impersonal machinery of history
molding our tastes."  Instead it's an attempt to locate our tastes within
a complex cultural space.  But, yes, "all we can do is interrogate these
structures" if we are not going to be inextricably bound by them.  I see
interrogation as the gateway to freedom, whereas you seem to see it as
confinement.

Every consciously "avant-garde" movement I can think of theorized itself
simultaneously with (or even previous to) the production of its art.  It's
only the writers whose tradition is so well-understood as to be invisible
who believe that their work should go without saying, that taste is
somehow "natural" or "innate."  And of course poets are "manipulating
cultural structures per se."  What *else* could they be/would they be
doing?  (Unless, of course, you care to divorce art from culture
entirely.)  The whole content of the other ongoing thread about creative
writing Ph.D. programs is exactly about the ways in which poets working
within cultural contexts manipulate cultural structures.

I think that the way I approach poetry specifically does *not* confuse
forests with trees, but locates specific trees within specific forests and
allows comparisons between kinds of trees and kinds of forests.  If you
want an example of exactly how I do this, with one poet in particular, you
can take a look at my chapter, "The Farmer of Dreams:  W.D. Ehrhart" in my
book, _Worlds of Hurt: Reading the Literatures of Trauma_.  If you think,
after reading it, that I somehow short Ehrhart as an "artist," I'd be
interested in hearing about it.

All of this heated discussion on "taste" brings me back to the gustatory
use of the word, and reminds me of the nearest thing to a "flame war"
that I've ever been involved in. It was on the list FOODWINE, after I'd
been hasty enough to respond instinctively with my (almost literally)
gut reaction to someone's suggestion of making broccoli pesto.

In taste (the tongue variety), genetic factors may play as large a part
as cultural - while tastes can definitely change (I used to loathe
olives, now I can't get enough), it seems that many people describe very
different flavours when tasting the same foods. Most leaf vegetables
taste bitter and almost sulphuric to me, whereas others describe them as
sweet.

Anyway, people get very passionate about their tastes, and regard them
as almost a badge of individuality - this may explain why we are so
loath to view our tastes as the product of cultural forces. I know I
feel a funny kind of kinship with anyone who hates coriander (cilantro)
or late Eliot, and sense a strange gulf between me and anyone who
dislikes Pinot Noir or Wallace Stevens.

If I'd venture a tentative opion, I'd say that the elements that shape
our tastes are more complex and on a finer scale than what we usually
regard as cultural forces. Perhaps the subcultures within which we move
are more important than capital-C Cultures - I'd feel more at home with
a Maori or Asian writer than with a Pakeha accountant.

The number of memes with which we come into contact in our lives is
enormous: why is it that some find fertile ground in our brains whereas
others have no effect? Some 'infections' can be explained culturally (my
taste for electronic music over guitar music fits in with my
mathematical background and my love of abstraction), but how can we
explain these original predilections? I tend towards the view that there
is (and I know that this is a dirty word in these circles) a genetic
influence - maybe I was born with a predisposition towards what we call
Western Logic. I don't know.


        tastefully yours,

        Tom Beard.

i like this aldon... and i would agree that kali was certainly not
suggesting that we're entirely at the mercy of 'the outside'... it's rather
a matter of emphasis---how we *discuss* the way we make value is what's at
stake here, which is, again, the meta-level of the "discussable" you
note... it's the matter of taste at that level that becomes the basis for
hard-to-resolve conflict... but i won't beat a dead horse, IF it's dead!...

and e---given that i'm interested in rehabbing the term "professional" for
leftist consumption, perhaps i should be so interested in "craft"... but
wrt this latter, the problem is that it cuts so many ways, which is what i
meant by "crafty" (not to mention the problems in german, and no---i don't
know german!---but i'm pretty familiar with the difficulties of translating
the latter)...

which craft?... ha!... but you get my drift?---i don't know a word mself
that quite captures the sense of "craft"... but i'm just as certain that
there's no need to build an entire aesthetic reality solely on same---which
has been the legacy of so much that has been paraded around under the
banner of "creative writing"...

mebbe we need a new space-craft, new handi-craft?...

rather than "craft," let's say i substitute "careful" wherever i can... and
at the same time, let's say i argue that we need both careful & careless in
order to produce art (perhaps this goes back to victor's "craft is long,
art is short" post?)... at least i wouldn't feel so hemmed in by folks who
insist on evaluating my work in terms of "craft" (which folks include
ME)... i mean, some of my work speaks to aesthetics based on craft, and
some DON'T, yknow?...

MS:

Adorno also comes back to it in the essay "Commitment" (trans. Frank
McDonagh, page 312 of Arato's _Essential Frankfurt School Reader_) in
which he writes "I have no wish to soften the saying that to write lyric
poetry after Auschwitz is barbaric" and then goes on to allow that
"literature must resist this verdict."  His comments in _Negative
Dialectics_ (page 362) can also be read as a modification of his original
position.

I like the Rothenberg line better.

Many of you know Dubravka Durcik and her husband Misko:  they have spent
time at Buffalo and Dubravka is both poet and critic and has translated
many of our essays.   I hear from Dubravka quite regularly but lately
nothing and meanwhile we have the specter of the student rebellions in
Belgrade (where D lives and works) on the nightly news and as usual
Clinton is doing absolutely nothing.

My question to the List is:  is there something we can specifically do to
add to the protest against Milosevic?  Would a group letter to the NY
Times be in order?  I'd love some feedback.

He made more films with Randolph Scott (my all time favourite Hollywood
actor) than with anyone else. But at the moment I cant remember them. He
also made a bullfight picture, and, of course "Legs Diamond". But his
westerns: I wish there were a festival of them. I'd subscribe. Trouble is,
several of his films are for some reason unavailable to midnight movie TV
use. I am so mad at myself, because on my last trip to NY, the day Beckett
died, I saw some pirated ones on lower 5th Ave., and didnt get them (I mean
for like $5), and instead just got the early "Night of the Living Dead."

an interesting tack can be taken from this infamous stmt in that a. says
not that poetry is impossible, but barbaric.  to decadents, barbaric was a
good thing, or at least a thing of possibility.  to the (to mix mediums as
well as eras, although it would be intriguing to suggest barth as
barbaric. . . )--but i digress: to the "used-upness" (that's barth's term)
of any certain genre or form, barbarism is a kind of antidote.  the
barbarian becomes history's child (Poggioli's phrase), and a "creativity"
is possible.  neo-greek poet constantin cavafis wrote, in "waiting for the
barbarians"
        --What will happen to us with no barbarians?
        Those people, after all, were a solution.
holocausts may be more decadent than barbaric (remember: decadant is from
the latin _cadre_: to fall; it's roots are in decay, not in that luscious
piece of chocolate cake you really shouldn't have), and the barbarians
the welcome forces at the gate, the new world after such an apocalypse. .

Actually, my two favorite westerns are Monte Hellman's _Ride In The
Whirlwind_ (Raymond Carver & Sons *wished* they could do minimalism
this well: "Better blisters than rope-burns") and Fritz Lang's _The
Return of Jesse James_, a non-sequitur noir western in which normals
wear black and anachronisms abound. (Lang: "I don't think this picture
depicted the West as it *was*; maybe it lived up to certain dreams,
certain illusions..."--_Fritz Lang: The Image and the Look_, edited by
Stephen Jenkins (British Film Institute)

As in the case of opera, I dislike the standard repertoire and
prefer more anomalous works. Leoni's Clint E. trilogy were the first
westerns I ever saw; Lynne Tillman always talks about John Ford,
but I hadn't even seen _The Searchers_ until three years ago. I
made a point of seeing _Searchers_ because Dario Argento loved it.
I happened to see this film with a full-blooded Cherokee Indian;
both she and I disliked the numerous stereotypes of Indians, black
people, women, the Irish, etc, though expecting John Wayne to be
PC is rather like requiring Shakespeare to lionize Jews. I did like
the darkness and implicit violence of Wayne's character, but it
annoyed me that Natalie Wood's character had to return to her
white family when she was already happy enough as an Indian bride.

Wayne (subliminally): "Wull, thuh Com-manch ain't human, y'know--not
buh wun red inch. They stole awr sex-shul property 'n they must dah."

Another thing I like about old westerns are the peculiar dialects, which
can sound as remote as Chaucer's and as deliciously artificial as Sidney's.

=46or the record, George, I *do* like Sam Peckinpah's violent ballets.
Also, I want to watch more westerns that involve my blood ancestor,
John Wesley Hardin. If you happen to think of any, let me know.

But the guy who should truly become the subject of a modern western
is none other than Bass Reeves, the undisputed fastest gun in the west,
who happened to be black. Reeves is said to have outshot even more
gunslingers than we know about, because he was never taught how to
write and therefore could not keep any record of his shootouts. When he
was a sheriff, Reeves once had to arrest his own son. And unlike
most gunfighters of the Old West, he didn't have blue eyes.

(John Wesley would have hated Reeves, but he wouldn't have outshot him.)

All the best,

Rob Hardin

Subject:      taste, everyday, and the tools of the master

i've been following the taste thread with great interest for a pretty
obvious reason, but i'll state it anyway: at 35 yrs old, i've had an
absolute, unshakeable opinion of the awfulness of something in fact,
shaken, enough times that i do, as kali states, want very much to know
WHY i like, or don't like something.

one thing i've found true disconcertingly often is that when i
don't like something, and don't know quite why, it is because the work
sounds like something i myself wrote a while back, or even, horrors,
recently.  and now i'm hearing it from the outside, it is WRONG WRONG
WRONG and if i admit that explicitly, why it is wrong, etc., then i
have to admit i wrote something dopey and god help us all, i might even
have published it.

admit it.  you ALL know EXACTLY what i am talking about, the 2 a.m
horrors when you say "oh my god, every single poem in that magazine
was thoroughly dreadful for X reason, and my poem fit RIGHT IN!

ACKKHHHGHGHGHGHHHHHH!!!!

ok, that skeleton is out of closet.

here comes the next.  sometimes, i read a poem or short story and get
restless and bored and irritated because i can't follow it.  this has
happened with enough certified "greats" (all right, you want names oh
interrogator, here: faulkner.  yes, i am one of those people who can't
stand reading faulkner.  nabokov.  mailer (oh, he is SUCH a chauvanist
turd i take that back.  it is PERFECTLY understandable not to be able to
stand his writing.  the executioners song was a fluke).  finnegan's wake)
that i just accept that my "taste," i.e. "what i like," is not infallible.

also, sometimes if i am trying hard, and ask around, i'll find something
someone says that can help me open up to what i am having trouble reading.
as with crime and punishment, joyce's ulysses, poems of richard hugo and
Elizabeth Bishop.

but to the meat of this too-long post, my most prominent day-to-day
struggle with "taste" occurs in my work as editor and
reader-of-poetry- for-friends.  i work with a journal.  the current
issue has, for me, seven YES! 's (one a YES YES!), three UCK's, and
four OK's.  now, we've had issues where every single thing in it is a
YES from my standpoint.  only, i'm an assistant editor here, my editor
has a standpoint that is close to, but not always, my own.  and our
readers have standpoints.  and the poetics list has standpoints, as do
my "writer/literature" friends (friends who write, or anyway, read),
all of whom stand in a chorus behind me interrogating MY TASTE as well
they should because on occasion they've made me open \ my tribe of
"in-my-taste" up.  (ps. kali, re choice of examples, i chose opera and
classical music (mostly) because it helped make the example clearer,
not because i think classical practitioners (be it of music, dance,
etc) are the only only possible "virtuosos."  after all, the chieftans,
whom i mention to illustrate that within the class of "virtuoso" there
are other than classical practioners, are an irish folk/instrumental,
blazingly good band.  clearly the mixup was, however, a flaw in my
example-giving process).

in my everyday, there are some works we get submitted to the magazine
that i just plain hate (the works, not necessarily (though sometimes)
the authors) because they are amateurish, clumsily manipulative,
arrogant in their cramming in of big latinate words and literary
references while at the same time making really foolish, give-away
mistakes (i think of these as the school of "if i use enough big,
intimadating words and references, no one will actually parse out the
poem well enough to realize that i can't string together a thought or
phrase, much less an original thought or phrase" writers.  boy they
piss me off.), and/or hallmark-y sentimental.  and, nods to kali, i
KNOW just why i don't like them.  i don't like things that are
claiming, by being sent out to publication (often accompanied by
letters demanding recognition) to be something they are not (skillful,
thoughtful, worked at, crafted (sorry joe, if there was a better word
i'd use it -- well made sounds too like the urn), dense,
knowledge-based -- knowledge which can come from university, academic,
life, and a wide and possibly idiosyncratic course of reading).

sometimes, though, even when i know why i hate something (X author
is a chauvinist, macho pig or Y author keeps using the word "[word]"
in all their poems), the actual writing is good, perhaps the writer
has done alot of interesting things even if i hate their viewpoint, or
if i make myself take each poem on its individual, not-connected-to
anything-i-know-about-author-or-author's-work, reading, it is ok.  and
so on.

point is, a magazine with some works in i'm not crazy about might not
be a bad thing.  i suspect i might well have "violent narrow taste"
and that something i hate now, i might be able to like in a few
months, or years.  i also like the sense of community, where not every
voice is saying things the i want said the way i want them said.  i DO
draw a line at rotten poems (hallmark-y; poems that use phrases and
images from a million other bad poems without any idea that they
aren't original; god help us the poems that will, by any means
necessary, rhyme -- if i NEVER AGAIN read the two words "dew" and
"you" coupled with stumbling meter in a poem it will be too soon!!!).

i still argue with myself over WHY i didn't -- or DID -- like various
movies or poems or short stories.  i stumble hardest and write from the
smallest, least productive hole, when i dismiss works and don't try to
make sure i know what and why i'm dismissing.

which brings me to a long-ago expressed opinion, again valid here.
there exists such a rich cumulative load of literature, at the same
time as a typically patriarchal emphasis on "mastering" text -- all
text, every single last quivering paragraph and semicolon.  the two
combine into a lethal critical approach i call the criticism of
dismissal.  if texts can be dismissed ("oh, X author is one of the
Z's, too obsessed with result at the expense of process/with the
continuity of history as opposed to the dialogue of the
historical/blah blah blah") then the dismisser, the MASTER, does not
have to read them, or know them.  in other words, since no
loud-talking MASTER of text can possibly have read every single work
of literature since the beginning of preservation of texts (nor can
anyone else, master or not), if one wants to adopt the pose of MASTER
of the text universe, one must come up with some ground clearing
expedient.  the criticism of dismissal is just such an expedient.

of course, both bring into question "taste" -- but i'm questioning
not so much the criteria used for "taste" as the motivation.

Joe,

One candidate for the faith you talk about might be the belief that
language does hook onto the world, that, mysterious as it may be, there
is something like "representation"; and another, related, that it is
possible for one person to communicate with another through language.
Scrutinized closely, it can seem as if communication and representation
must be impossible -- and yet we go on naming and talking despite our
philosophical skepticism, as if we had some animal faith in language.
That for poets anyway -- dunno what sustains painters!  Belief in light?

----
stray thots ...

I've been thinking lately about revisionism and the formation of
alternative & idiosyncratic canons.  Olson has his Mayans & Sumerians,
Herodotus, etc.  It was hardly scandalous for Pound to treat Homer &
Dante as important, but Arnaut Daniel, Cavalcanti, Villon -- these guys
still aren't taught as the monuments in history Pound thought they were,
are they?  (And what abt the presence Chinese poetry has in English
after Pound -- that's a thorny issue I suppose, but seems related to
me.)

Some of this has to do with art and some (esp w/ Pound) with craft.

It's easy to imagine a poet with a different background attaching
considerable importance to Henry Rollins and Jim Carroll.  It's pretty
easy to imagine his best friend, with a similar background, always
talking about Villon, carrying around the little paperback with a
preface by someone named Williams.

First place I remember seeing John Ashbery's name was in Foucault's book
about Raymond Roussel (sp?), an interview, and there's this funny moment
where Foucault indicates that he finds Roussel interesting but not
nearly as important as Ashbery does -- "Proust he ain't", or words to
that effect.  Roussel is in Ashbery's idiocanon.

Influential teachers, Blackmur say, have often left an imprint of their
idiocanon upon that of their students.  Wystan has indicated, I think,
that he tries not to do this.  The classrooom is tricky.  But in many
contexts, the expression of taste, the poet's enunciation of his
idiocanon, is not so much authoritative as an invitation to construct
your own.

Having just finished reading The Pound Era, I'm reminded of something
Kenner says, that wide-eyed visitors to St Elizabeth's might come away
thinking Roman poetry consists of Catullus and Propertius.  And the
point, says Kenner, is that Pound always presumed an excellent classical
education, and that his comments were offered as a corrective, a shift
in emphasis or a filling in of gaps.  (Catullus is not in Basil
Bunting's idiocanon: he breaks off an "overdraft"/translation in
mid-sentence, saying "--and why Catullus bothered to write pages and
pages of this drivel mystifies me.")

Good place to stop.

Steve -- I wonder how much of a "reconsidering" this is; it feels much
more like a buttressing of the early position.
        Let me quote Jeremy Adler from a TLS piece on his father, the
poet/writer HG Adler who, as noted in my previous post, did write poetry
in & after Auschwitz: "When the celebrated 'After Auschwitz' chapter in
*Negative Dialectik* (1966) elaborated his original dictum into an
aesthetic, and reformulated his position as a new categorical
imperative, namely that we must think and act in such a way that
Auschwitz cannot be repeated, this chapter also included a thinly veiled
but bitter attack on HG Adler:'All culture after Auschwitz is garbage'
Adorno provocatively maintains, and scorns HG Adler as 'the one who got
away' (_'der Entronnene'_) for wishing to maintain 'hope' in this
hopeless situation. Adorno holds that the only valid response to
Auschwitz can be found in Beckett, for whom 'what exists is like a
concentration camp. The only hope is, that nothing exists...' Through
its dialectical sniping against the religious beliefs which sustained HG
Adler in the camps, which Adorno ridicules as _Sch�tzengrabenreligion_
('trench religion'), his critique turns into an unintended attack on
Judaism too." (TLA October 4, 1996)

Subject:      what graduate studies do
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII

        I'd like to agree with Ron Silliman's comments the other day about
the role that graduate students play in keeping employed professors
employed, so to speak, and also in the need for English departments to
engage in the honest telling of the tale about the job prospects ahead
for those who pursue graduate degrees.

        The situation is made more complex, of course, by the way the
economic/social investment of English department professors has profound
links to their psychological reactions to this problem. Many English
department professors got their jobs at a time when there were many jobs;
such professors often find it difficult actually to BELIEVE, in my
experience, how different the experience of their graduate students is
from their own. Academic jobs are often not great jobs by any means;
nonetheless the difference between having a stable academic position, and
a part-time poorly paid adjunct position or some variation thereof, can be
intense. I recall a professor I know, actually quite sympathetic to the
cause of part-timers and graduate students, telling me about his plans for
a summer European vacation and asking me what I was doing in the summer;
when I said "looking for some kind of temp job so I can make it through to
the fall," he was greatly sympathetic, but also SHOCKED--oddly enough, it
simply hadn't occured to him that part-time professors and graduate
students don't often go on vacations or spend the summer working on their
writing, but spend a lot of time scrambling for other part-time work of
various kinds.

        Sometimes, of course, full-time professors can be actively
complicit in hiding economic realities from their graduate students; in
many other cases, it's not so much an active complicity as rather a
collective institutional delusion. In a situation where the very
possibility of tenure in general is now coming under intense attack (such
as the case at Minnesota), many professors (who were not, it must be
admitted, ever all that attuned to the social realities of their country)
simply can't DEAL with the fact that, indeed, that there literally may be
no such thing as permanent tenured positions in English AT ALL in the
United States in, say, 20-30 years from now. By no means am I defending
those professors who can't accept this reality, but I am suggesting how
their own desires/investments in their own professional life make certain
realities pass them by.

        The main reaction of professors, at the university where I was in
graduate school, was that there was still a "proper" way to get a
university job, and anyone who didn't follow that "proper" method would be
themselves personally responsible for the failure to get a job. "Proper"
method meant, of course, choosing an academic field, reading thoroughly
ALL academic scholars/critics who write in that field, reading the
particular
small portion of the academic literary canon that such a field covered,
and then preparing yourself to present your "expertise" when job
interviews rolled around, assuming they ever did.

        Then, of course, there are the collective institutional delusions
of students, both graduates and undergraduates. These delusions seem to me
far more tragic. Quite often among my students, graduate and
undergraduate, the love of literature is incredibly intense, all
consuming. They love books so much, and they want to devote their lives to
passing that love on to others. They want to do something interesting with
their lives--who can blame them? One can tell such students about "social
reality" and one SHOULD tell them. But 20 year olds, even 25 year olds,
have such intense belief in the POWER OF WHAT THEY LOVE that it can be
easy for them not to deal with economic consequences that in many ways
will only emerge later. You can tell them that there are no jobs, no
future in this, you'll have to make a living some other way. But how to
make someone who desperately wants to believe that they can make a living
doing what they love that they live in a country where, increasingly, that
is an impossibility?

        I had a 21-year old student in my office the other day. She LOVES
Modernist poetry; Stein is amazing, Williams is amazing, she wants more of
it. She wants to go to graduate school. I tell her about these economic
realities, and she understands them--I mean this seriously, she really
does. And then I ask her "Why do you want to go to graduate school?" And
she says, "Because literature is what MATTERS to me. It may be ALL that
matters to me." And I wonder to myself what to say to her. That we live in
a society where feeling the way she does may lead her to future serious
problems? That maybe she's better off not going to graduate school? Well,
she knows that, and she doesn't care. And I think to
myself, you know, that's the way I felt too--in fact, it's the way I still
feel. I know that, and I don't care. And I end up telling her that I've
devoted my own life to writing, despite the fact of what was going to
happen to me, that since I've spent years doing the things I think I
should do, despite what anyone otherwise tells me, the only thing I can
tell her to do is to devote her life to what she wants to devote it to,
and to what she loves. But pay attention to practical reality, I tell her,
you MORE THAN ANYONE have got to pay attention to practical reality. And
she hears me, she does, and she walks out of my office, and I have no idea
what is going to happen to either one of us.

At 8 I read a wonderful German translation (it cut all the
religio-pompous naturo-romance verbiage down to size) of james fenimore
Cooper's PRAIRIE -- with the early eastern-westerns right after that --
my love for upstate new york, the Hudson & lake areas I always ascribe
to leatherstocking country  being the psychotopography of my early
imagination of the foreign -- just as discivering the djott el-djerid,
the salt marsh/desert between the algerian oasis of the souf and the
tunisian city of Gafsa was an instant recognition of the much beloved
topography of the open chapter of  volume 1 of Karl May's 72 volumes of
"Reise-erz�hlungen" -- which of course include the many volumes set in
the "Wild West" with  Old Shatterhand and Winnetou as heros.

After that it was on to Ernest Haycox, Zane Gray, Louis L'Amour &
hundreds of German comics-type western tales -- then Lucky Luke, the
great French comic strip.

Only later the "serious" writings dealing with the modern west by the
likes of Douglas Woolf,William Eastlake, Ed Dorn (the fiction, not only
*Slinger* and *Gran Apacheria*), etc.

guess I better hunker down & read them bow'ring novellas too now...

haven't seen *ride in the whirlwind*, rob, but this and *the shooting* were
(according to maltin here, again) filmed simultaneously... and the latter
is worth checking out (esp. jack nicholson's perf.), as is lang's pic you
mention...

i do understand the reservations you express wrt *the searchers*... these
just can't be wished away, and whether one can 'forgive' (forgive me this
word) any work its age or flaws (let's say) is probably going to be a
matter of that complex kali refers to... personally, i find great solace in
*the searchers* just in terms of the way the film moves, its use of
landscape, its more quiet, less assuming features (as opposed, say, to the
more subliminal aspects of wayne's character)... but i'd say you'd have to
be so forgiving to appreciate most of ford, in fact---even a flick which i
adore mightily, *the grapes of wrath* (though perhaps less so here)...

as to wood's "homecoming," it's no more problematic, on the surface of it,
than her having been abducted in the first place, no?... though perhaps
weak as a form of racial closure in today's terms, what's at least being
hinted at (and again, i agree---at the expense of natives) is that racial
otherness can be accommodated... i mean, it would hardly be realistic, so
to speak, if ethan (or anybody else in that flick---and let's keep in mind
the "half-breed" status of jeffrey hunter) did a complete about-face... but
that the film places so much dramatic emphasis on reunion clearly assuages
white anxieties, yes...

suicide among trauma survivors of all kinds is quite common.  suicides of
american viet nam war combat veterans are very high, as are suicides of rape
and/or incest survivors.  lots of theories about this.  my own is that the
burden of dual vision is sometimes too difficult to bear.  if you read
tadeusz borowski (whose _this way to the gas, ladies and gentleman_ is one
of the few holocaust texts to make strong use of dark humor) it seems to me
pretty understandable that life inside his head would be intolerable.

i tend to think of trauma as a "plot violation."  we've all got these
stories we live our lives by--get up, go to work, catch the bus home, etc.
of course, there *is* no plot, but the pretense that there is one works for
most of us, unless (to lean on Eco for a moment), trauma forces us to
discover its absence by mistake.  trauma is that moment in life when all our
stories fail and we find ourselves thinking "but this isn't supposed to be
happening to me!"

those who spend a significant period of time in a traumatic environment (a
concentration camp, a combat zone, a home where violent sexual abuse becomes
the norm) are forced to generate new stories to explain what is happening to
them.  usually these stories have little to do with the stories which shaped
their expectations in their "previous lives."

at the conclusion of the traumatic experience (the release from the camp,
the DEROS date, the escape from the violent home), the survivor is returned
to a world where everyone else's stories are essentially intact.  survivor
authors are alternately compelled to tell their tales of trauma (under the
banner of "never again," or other similar calls) and in hopeless despair
about the impossibility of conveying their experience with mere words.  i
think it is at the moment when the gap seems completely unbridgeable, and
the efforts the author (or storyteller) have made seem to have been to no
avail, that hopelessness sets in, and suicide seems like a viable option.
guilt may have something to do with it, but i think only because the telling
of the tale doesn't seem to pay the debt to the dead.

i always think of two stories when this subject comes up.  one is of a woman
who we interviewed when i was working for the u.s. holocaust memorial
museum.  this woman was in her sixties, healthy and successful, with several
grandchildren of whom she was very proud.  she told her story of survival at
auschwitz and then looked at the interviewer in a puzzled fashion.  i don't
have the transcript here, but she said something like, "it's so strange."
and she gestured to her rather plump form.  "right now, i'm on a diet.  but
part of me is always in the camps, and always hungry.  i've never gotten out
of the habit of carrying biscuits in my pocket."  dual vision.  survivors
always see the world through two sets of eyes--one caught forever in the
traumatic environment; one which operates in the everyday of the
untraumatized world.

the other story concerns a viet vet friend of mine who was asked, one time
too many, if _platoon_ was a "realistic" viet nam war movie.  he heaved a
sigh of great exasperation and said that _no_ war movie could be realistic.
"a realistic war movie would be one in which, suddenly, in the midst of the
picture, someone came out and sprayed the audience with machine gun fire
while every third seat exploded."  survivors know that trauma can never be
conveyed or related by storytelling--words don't rupture people's personal
plots, though they may be able to impress people's conscious minds.
survivors know that in the case of trauma, only being is believing.

You can add to what is prob. a very long list Anja Spiegelman, mother of
_Maus_ cartoonist Art Spiegelman. I'm reading _Maus_ for the first time, for
a class called "Narrative & the Arts," and am completely caught up in it; I
find it just amazing. I think the late Terrence Des Pres addresses the issue
of "survivor suicide" in his book _The Survivor_ but it's been awhile and I
can't remember now for sure. Robert Jay Lifton may also address it in some
of his work, though he has written more about the survivors of Hiroshima.

Tom,

Maybe some of our predilections *are* innate.  The problem for me, though,
is how we sort out innate predilections from culturally inculcated
predilections.  And of course, innate predilections are influenced by
culture as well.  (I train my dogs, and I'm thinking now of how you can ruin
a "good" dog with "bad" training, and you can turn a "bad" dog into at least
an acceptable dog with "good" training.  And also how you can start with a
dog who has a "natural taste" for fetching, and you can easily turn that
innate attribute into an interest in a variety of kinds of "work"... none of
which may involve fetching but which turn out to fulfill the same needs in
the dog that fetching fulfills, or [through "bad" training] completely
destroy her interest in fetching.  The influences on people are much more
complicated than the influences on dogs--partly because childhood is so long
for people--and we have a hard time figuring *dogs* out.)

I figure that as long as these innate qualities can't be sorted out, we
might as well concentrate on the cultural influences we *can* sort out.  If
we do a really complete job of this (which doesn't yet seem possible--and
may never be), I suppose we can assume that whatever is "left over" is innate.

yeah, ok, i'll throw in with the boetticher fans here too, what with the
seven or so randolph scott westerns he made (and burt kennedy scripted)...
*the tall t* (with, again, richard boone) and *buchanan rides alone* are my
favorites... boetticher's *the bullfighter and the lady* is pretty much
*the* bullfighting flick, though his life itself was in some ways more
amazing than his films... he wrote an autobiography, as i recall...

but i like anthony mann's stuff better!...

and hey:  i think van kilmer's doc pretty much makes *tombstone*, is the
centerpiece of that film... i savor every moment he's onscreen---really
quite something, how he plays that homoerotic angle, and even more reason
why i didn't like his batman... but nothin agains dennis quaid either, or
for that matter victor mature's elegant handling...

and george:  i must admit, i've read only a few westerns (strictly
speaking)... didn't even care much for western comic books when i was into
comics, go figure... sorry man!... don't quite know why this is (talk about
not thinking through my tastes!), though it may perhaps be in the more
conventional prose that comprises so much of this writing (i haven't read
your stuff, so please don't take offense!)... i've tried one louis l'amour,
and it didn't do nothin' for me... though cormak mccarthy is another
story...

& three cheers for primo levi, using his *the periodic table* next semester
in my, uhm, tech. writing class...

best,

>high all the way 'round...

>can any of you make these numbers speak to your own life and work

anyway, my point in the above was to ground out a discussion of pay for
*virtual* courses and the like in terms of postsecondary material
disparities... i've found that it's just not possible to talk about wage or
opportunity w/o some fine distinctions, which reveal some crude
inequities... and that we had all better tune in to precisely what those
inequities are...

on the one hand, i'm a proponent of collective bargaining... at the same
time, i have to reiterate what so many have already said:  that one should
pursue a phd b/c one loves the pursuit, and plan on making money doing
something other than teaching...

i understand this is spoken from the subject position of one who holds a
mighty 3/3.... but LO---at the amazing wage of $34,500 (in chicago) after
five years on my campus (plus two years visiting elsewhere, and one
adjunct), and at the ripe old age of 41... and ysee---unless i'm willing to
throw in some customarily personal factors (such as my wife's income, or
family support, or credit card debt, or whatever) then who can really
understand where i'm coming from?... i have one colleague who drives a taxi
at night to make ends meet, and another who sports either a sporty new car
or a new-ish four-wheel drive blazer...

so i think the challenge here is to be as honest as we can be about our
individual situations, and about our local situations, while pushing at the
same time to ensure that the institution---nationally, say---moves in
equitable directions... and i fully understand why my colleague who drives
a taxi by night pushes a bit harder than most...

best,

As a former colleague of Mark's in adjunct thralldom (hi Mark), I read
his post with nothing but sad assent.  I suppose I am one of the very few
lucky ones of our generation who've actually gotten a tenure-track job,
at a place where tenure is under the same creeping attack it is in so
many places--but it looks like it'll last until I get _mine_, so perhaps
I speak out of some unconscious comfort.

This isn't the world's greatest job--but the teaching load (3/2) and the
pay are far better, I know, than I could expect from many fulltime
positions; and it's lightyears better than adjuncting.  (And I know as
well about temping summers, and how fulltime faculty too often seem quite
oblivious to the extremities to which adjuncts resort to pay the rent.)

I know about the consuming love for poetry that Mark talks about--and I
know as well that I can't imagine doing anything else, at least given the
way I've spent the last ten years.  His advice to his graduate student
strikes me as the only thing one can say.  Writers and scholars of Mark's
and my generation were led down a primrose path in a way--our mentors saw
our devotion and love of writing, and encouraged us to do what they
thought we could do well and what they thought would be rewarded in the
real world.  But those rewards simply aren't there anymore--perhaps the
most honest thing to do would simply be to close down or radically
curtail the PhD programs for the foreseeable future, to make it clear
that if one wants to make a life out of writing that one will have to do
outside of the academy.  I'm glad to be teaching in a department that has
no PhD program--there's no lying involved here:  our MA students know
that the only real career prospects for them lie in teaching in the
public schools or the community college system here in Florida (and
happily enough, there seems to be lots of demand for those people); most
of them have no illusions about what their futures hold.

And perhaps I've been a bit naive, but watching the actual hiring process
from the inside, rather than as an anxious interviewee, has rid me of
many illusions.  Watching sausage being made doesn't hold a candle to
seeing universities make decisions on new faculty.  The entire business
is so sordid and interested--given the highminded rhetoric in which it's
couched--that I'm tempted to advise potential PhD candidates to go and
take the foreign service exam or apply for the CIA--those organizations at
least don't pretend to be pursuing some sort of disinterested goals.

Thanks, Mark, for a thoughtful and rather moving post.  See you later
this month at the meat market.

Karl et al.,

My initial objection to CW PhD programs is simply that they may delude
people into thinking that if they get the PhD then they are necessarily
bona fide writers; in other words, I can imagine someone whose career as
a writer ends with the degree, not because the once student now graduate
wants the career to end there, but because the person has no talent and
can't get published and so on. And I hasten to say here that I realize that
in saying the above I am inviting commentary on what it means to be a
writer; so let me say now that you should please not construe from
my remarks here any particular philosophy about the vocation of writing.

George, although I grew up in the West, I didn't grow up on those novels.
But later I certainly came to admire such novels of the west as Willa
Cather's Death Comes to the Archbishop, and even some of Edward Abbey,
although he can be entirely sentimental at times. I certainly knew people
who grew up reading Louis L'Amour and Zane Gray twenty years ago -- whether
there are some who still do, I don't know. Which ones did you grow up reading?

finally getting around to chewing through pierre's post from SO long ago
(around 48 hrs!) about cspace as the frontier etc...

and yknow, the popularity of the western in these spaces (self-fulfilling
prophecy for my part, i know) speaks precisely to the sense that these
spaces seem a sort of west, a sort of opening out (though due east of my
location---IF i'm willing to locate "this" post someplace in the heart of a
suny/b mainframe, and if i'm willing to locate "mself" as in chicago)...

there's so much hype (incl. my own at times) about cspace that saying so
may be mere platitude, but it strikes me that so many of us around here are
such cowboy or cowgirl junkies...

joe
i think i know what you mean about craft -- the tie-in to writing programs.
i have some problems with those, the main one being that they seem arranged
to admit people with connections, the "good" recommendation letters, but
the people who most could use what they offer are the people WITHOUT
connections, who HAVE no one to write recommendation letters... that is,...
THE BEGINNERS!  it all seems to work into a Certify In Something Or Other
factory.  but on the other hand, a little time to write, someone to pay
attention and give you focused response, is that not a paradise of sorts?
anyway, by craft, no, i would not, repeat, would NOT say it was that which
is embued by apprenticeship with Famous Writer.

you know, so many of the great, original writers came to their writing as
a solitary process (although with immense, hungry, chaotic reading) that
there is a lot to be said for the "individual finding their own way" method.
though since one (i should HOPE) is reading other poets, it isn't quite so
alone, as it is self-guided.

what i have in mind by craft was captured beautifully by someone in the
descriptive "attentive" -- a sort of deep, intense, committed attention
to what is happening in the arrangement of the words, in the shaping of
the idea, in the tracing out of where the idea goes.  i suppose i emphasize
craft because i really am tired to screaming of cocktail napkin school of
poetry (you know, person gets drunk, writes their Beautiful Thoughts  --
usually in terrible rhymes -- on a cocktail napkin, then shows this napkin,
because they can't even be bothered to recopy it, much less rewrite and
re-edit, whenever they want to prove how Lofty and Intelligent and
Philosophical they are.  GRRRHHHHHHHHH!!!) and a notion of "craft," as
in workmanship, deep attention, lifetime course of learning more, tools,
flexibility, respect, is such an antidote.

dear lynda (and dan)
honestly, i wouldn't worry about it.  there are always sour people on any
list who live for an excuse to blast other people.  once and a while poems
go out on list, though usually only if connected to a topic under discussion.
it sounds more, lynda, as if you are hoping for a poetry mailing list or
workshop group.  i can think of a few on the web, if you have access to the
internet (a site i'm involved in, Creative Coalition of Artists, has one),
where people post poems and others respond.  i don't do much with the CCA
site, and right now we're having problems getting the cgi scripts up at our
new provider.  but it is there.  articulata also runs a site, and gives
contributers an opportunity to post a selection of their own work (all for
free).  i would guess there are others...

the emergence of the "contingent" work force has so many of us, i guess, in
the bind that you speak of -- the one that makes us consider (reconsider)
our career choices and inspires us as well to issue the kinds of warnings
you exemplify so well in the story about your student.  Quite clearly the
prospect of acquiring that full-time, tenure-track professorial position i
might have once dreamed about (dream modeled, no doubt, on what were
probably the deluded ideas you spoke of) seems less likely now, and although
it remains a possibility down the road, i've adopted my "contingent" role
for the most part with the same resolve and perhaps even fortitude that i'd
think a lot of workers have (since the contingent work force is hardly an
entity exclusive to the current academic environment but rather seems the
order of the day).

Almost all of the instructors i know make their living "drifting" from
school to school, accruing a salary piecemeal, but accruing it nonetheless
(the slang in CA i think is "freeway flyer" -- is this common elsewhere?).
Writers on the subject of contingent workforce often point out the
advantages of such a life--flexibility, freedom, variety, etc.--and perhaps
there's some wisdom in that, although, depending on the particular
situation, the disadvantages (instability, etc.) could outweigh.

One reason for hope, i believe, might be what i perceive to be a
re-emergence of interest in liberal studies, particularly in the guise of
that new academic rubric "Writing and Commuications."  I currently work for
a university (part-time, "associate" faculty) that caters primarily to adult
professionals returning to complete or acquire degrees in everything from
Business and Management to, well, Liberal Studies.  I'm constantly being
reminded, by students and faculty alike, and even across disciplines, that
there's a real need out there in all fields for people who know how to
write/communicate effectively, a notion which has some lasting resonance,
for me at least, given the fact that i'm working with people who have been
"out there" and who, having recognized the need, come back to do something
about it.

My feeling is that there is, in fact, a solid market for teachers of
writing--and that the specific situation i'm speaking of here may herald a
new "professional" interest in fundamental thinking/writing/communicating
skills that could, in turn, create jobs (albeit contingent) for the
dedicated.  Of course this may be unique to my local environment and my
perception, but as a teacher of writing myself i do feel for the most part
"in demand" -- the market may be shifting to a different group (i.e., from
undergratuage state university to private professional university), but it's
there nonetheless.

The trick, i guess, is to empower ourselves through our new role as
"contingent" teacher / and i'd be curious to know how you or anyone else
might envision the process by which one could do that.  Given a few select
memories of certain "full professors" i had, as both grad and undergraduate,
and also given the unique series of contortions you point out as being
necessary to the "proper method" of getting a job, i'm not so sure i'm
interested anymore in aspiring to that goal, delusion or not.

Take care.

Bill

For those who don't recognize the phrase

 "The Man Who Shot the Other Man"

it is the title of a poem of mine in Letters of the Law (Sun & Moon
1994 -- available from SPD, Rod, etc.), the first poem in the book in
fact.

A friend of mine is the source: "Oh, you always want to watch some
movie about 'the man who shot the other man'" she said.

Obviously the phrase is a turn on "The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance" by
Ford,

I understand your point. I went through that delusion upon getting an MFA:
I imagined that suddenly I would begin to be published everywhere, that
writing would become easy somehow just because I'd earned my credential.
It took me a while to get over it, to realize that any fully engaged
writer must constantly re-embrace her/his apprenticeship, that there's
NEVER a point at which she/he stops learning and begins writing. (You were
right. It's difficult to avoid philosophizing about the nature of the
artistic enterprise when you begin to examine the artist's expectations
and societal role.) However, I think that the feeling that one is 'done'
as a writer, that one finally knows what she/he is doing, is a stage most
young writers, whether in the academy or not, go through. Maybe I'm wrong
about that. Anyway, my point is that no one who is talented and active
will be limited by a creative-emphasis PhD, not any more than someone who
is talentless and lazy will be enhanced by one. Writing and publishing
are hard no matter the context of one's life/living.

it's possible that taste has never been experienced or looked at outside
an investigation however selforunselfconscious of its relation to power
structures race class gender: however one problem we postmodern folk who
know Pound for example knowing this (we could do likewise with Stein or
Williams or Eliot) is how do we experience agency . . . our perceived and
experienced subject position to make decisions and commitments with very
real consequences.

so it's not either the aesthetic or the political but both and

Rod,

Do you know David Shapiro's powerful response to Adorno: an essay called
"After"?

In a book called Testimony, ed. David Rosenberg.

A hugely powerful piece with everything to do with Celan and Rothenberg.

It inspired my poem Slivovitz (in Talisman 15).

I think history is a kind of litmus test for politics.  Adorno's
perception is the crux of that: if we can't speak we can't speak.

All best,
Joseph

Avrom Sutzkever is probably less read by avant-garde poets than he should
be: he was in the Vilna ghetto and resistance: a remarkable poet, gorgeous
and haunted in a way almost completely unlike the way Celan is.

just read a poignant tribute in the chicago trib. magazine, "for paul:
appreciating a fallen poet who led a brief revival of the art," by barry
silesky, about the poet paul carroll, who evidently died last summer... it
mentions that paul hoover (hi paul and maxine! if you're out there) was a
student of carroll's, and i'm just wondering if anybody is familiar with
his work... the article mentions that in 1968, carroll wrote _the poem in
its skin_, and "edited a major anthology, _the young american poets_, which
came to be the first major publication for many of its since-famous
contributors"... anyway, just trying to get a grip on paul carroll's
poetry...

i wont argue about the rhyming napkin bit but i think that something
should be said for other methods of composition/construction.  the
version of craft here is only one means only one sort of process that can
be used to create writing effects--anyone whos read kathy acker can
attest to the strangeness of what happens there and while it does not fit
this description of craft it nevertheless produces readerly responses.
frank ohara is another case: many poems are occasional in just the sense
of the napkins here mentioned--yet they are brilliant moments.  perhaps i
am just not much of a romantic humanist but the notion of an isolated
individual toiling away at his (!) craft does not account for all the
methods of aesthetic production in this technological age.  benjamin not
wordsworth.  reproduction not authenticity.

There are, and always have been, cheaper and perhaps better ways to study
and discuss literature than attending graduate school -- some get PhDs
because teaching is one of the only ways to make any kind of living at
all working directly with literature -- but I've always believed that the
only compelling reason to go through what one goes through in a PhD
program is a desire to work with literature specifically as an educator
--
now, I agree with much in the recent posts on this subject, but there is
an odd acceptance hovering around some of the discussion -- If one looks
at the demographics (the same figures that caused people in the
mid-eighties to predict a coming teacher shortage) it is clear that the
numbers probably would be there (at least on a national scale) to employ
a considerably larger percentage of hte PhDs in English than we are
currently employing -- There are few schools at which grad. students are
their to give employment to the professors -- the majority of
universities and colleges in the U.S. would have no trouble at all
finding plenty of work for their current professors to do working only
with undergrads  (let us hastily admit that many of our colleagues don't
want to be so employed) --

At San Jose State, we were ordered to make cuts at a time when our number
of English majors was increasing -- and we were not alone in this --

There is a reason that universities want to shrink the number of tenured,
tenure-track and full-time instructors -- They call it flexibility --
what would you call it?

One of two things is going to happen if we do not succeed in making
significant political changes with regard to education issues soon --
either the right will succeed in privatizing higher education and
rationing the goods (and you can guess who will get the goodies under
that scenario) -- or "liberals" will reach a compromise under which
higher education will be offered to larger numbers of students using a
labor force of MOSTLY part-time and untenured faculty --

Jobs didn't just disappear because of a recession, and they didn't
disappear because of a real drop in the numbers of college age youth with
a least a modicum of desire for humanities and arts education --

On the up-side -- school measures finally started to win again on the
ballot in Colorado this time around (where I read in the morning paper
about a charter school that has been violating all the laws with regard
to education for the "disabled")

adorno's _prisms_ (p. 34): "The more total society becomes, the greater
the reification of the mind and the more paradoxical its effort to escape
reification on its own. Even the most extreme consciousness of doom
threatens to degenerate into idle chatter. Cultural criticism finds
itself faced with the final stage of the dialectic with culture and
barbarism. To write poetry after Auschwitz is barbaric."
also see adorno's _negative dialectics_, and rothenberg's _khurbn_: "an
answer . . . to the proposition."

From A Philosophical Enquiry into the Origin of Our Ideas of the Sublime
and Beautiful

(Second edition, 1759)

"ON TASTE"

On a superficial view, we may seem to differ very widely from each other
in our reasonings, and no less in our pleasures:  but notwithstanding
this difference, which I think to be rather apparent than real, it is
probable that the standard both of reason and Taste is the same in all
human creatures.  For if there were not some principles of Judgment as
well as of sentiment common to all mankind, no hold could possibly be
taken either on their reason or their passions, sufficient to maintain
the ordinary correspondence of life.  It appears indeed to be generally
acknowledged, that with regard to truth and falsehood there is something
fixed.  We find people in their disputes continually appealing to certain
tests and standards which are allowed on all sides, and are supposed to
be established in our common nature.  But there is not the same obvious
concurrence in any uniform or settled principles which relate to Taste.
It is even commonly supposed that this delicate and aerial faculty, which
seems too volatile to endure even the chains of a definition, cannot be
properly tried by any test, nor regulated by any standard.  There is so
continual a call for the exercise of the reasoning faculty, and it is so
much strengthened by perpetual contention, that certain maxims of right
reason seem to be tacitly settled amongst the most ignorant.  The learned
have improved on this rude science, and reduced those maxims into a
system.  If Taste has not been so happily cultivated, it was not that the
subject was barren, but that the labourers were few or negligent; for to
say the truth, there are not the same interesting motives to impel us to
fix the one, which urge us to ascertain the other.  And after all, if men
differ in their opinion concerning such matters, their difference is not
attended with the same important consequences, else I make no doubt but
that the logic of Taste, if I may be allowed the expression, might very
possibly be as well digested, and we might come to discuss matters of
this nature with as much certainty, as those which seem more immediately
within the province of mere reason.  And indeed it is very necessary at
the entrance into such an enquiry, as our present, to make this point as
clear as possible; for if Taste has no fixed principles, if the
imagination is not affected according to some invariable and certain
laws, our labour is like to be employed to very little purpose; as it
must be judged an useless, if not an absurd undertaking, to lay down
rules for caprice, and to set up for a legislator of whims and fancies....

[This document was prepared by Charles Bernstein (bernstei@bway.net) and
Loss Pequen~o Glazier (glazier@acsu.buffalo.edu).]
____________________________________________________________________

1. About the Poetics List

Please note that this is a private list and information about the list
should not be posted to other lists or directories of lists. The idea is to
keep the list to those with specific rather than general interests, and also
to keep the scale of the list small and the volume manageable.

The Poetics List, while committed to openness, is moderated. While
individual posts of participants are sent directly to all subscribers, we
continue to work to promote the editorial function of this project. The
definition of that project, while provisional, and while open to continual
redefinition by list participants, is nonetheless aversive to a generalized
discussion of poetry. Rather, our aim is  to support, inform, and extend
those directions in poetry that are committed to innovations, renovations,
and investigations of form and/or/as content, to the questioning of received
forms and styles, and to the creation of the otherwise unimagined, untried,
unexpected, improbable, and impossible.

The "list owner" of Poetics is Charles Bernstein: contact him for further
information. Joel Kuszai is currently working on the administration of the
list.  For subscription information contact us at POETICS@acsu.buffalo.edu.


____________________________________________________________________

2. Subscriptions

The list has open subscriptions.  You can subscribe (sub) or
unsubscribe (unsub) by sending a one-line message, with no subject
line, to:

listserv@listserv.acsu.buffalo.edu

the one-line message should say:

unsub poetics

{or}

sub poetics Jill Jillway

(replacing Jill Jillway with your own name; but note: do not use your
name to unsub)

We will be sent a notice of all subscription activity.

*
If you are having difficulty unsubscribing, please note:

Sometimes your e-mail address may be changed slightly by your system
administrator.  If this happens you will not be able to send messages to
Poetics or to unsubscribe, although you will continue to get your Poetics
mail.  To avoid this, unsub from the old address and resub from the new
address.  If you can no longer do this there is a solution if you use Eudora
(an e-mail program that is available free at shareware sites): from the Tools
menu select "Options" and then select set-up for "Sending Mail": you can
substitute your old address here and send the unsub message.

The most frequent problem with subscriptions is bounced messages.  If your
system is often down or if you have a low disk quota, Poetics messages may
get bounced.  Please try avoid having messages from the list returned to us.
If the problem is low disk quota, you may wish to request an increase from
your system administrator. (You may wish to argue that this subscription is
part of your scholarly communication!) You may also wish to consider
obtaining a commercial account.

____________________________________________________________________

3.  Cautions

Please do not send attachments or include extremely long documents in a
post, since this may make it difficult for those who get the list via
"digest" or who cannot decode attached or specially formatted files.

In addition to being archived at the EPC, some posts to Poetics (especially
reviews, obituary notices, announcements, etc.) may also become part of
specific EPC subject areas. (See section 7.)

Please do not send inquiries to the list to get an individual subscribers
address. To get this information, see section 6.

If you want someone to send out information to the list as a whole, or
supply information missing from an post, please send the request or comment
to the individual backchannel, not to the whole list.

____________________________________________________________________

4. Digest Option

The Poetics List can send a large number of individual messages to
your account to each day!  If you would prefer to receive ONE message
each day, which would include all messages posted to the list for that
day, you can use the digest option.  Send this one-line message (no subject
line) to
                                listserv@listserv.acsu.buffalo.edu

set poetics digest

NOTE:!! Send this message to "listserv" not to Poetics or as a reply
to this message!!

You can switch back to individual messages by sending this message:

set poetics mail
____________________________________________________________________

5. Temporarily turning off Poetics mail

Do not leave your Poetics subscription "active" if you are going to be away
for any extended period of time! Your account may become flooded and you may
lose not only Poetics messages but other important mail. You can temporarily
turn off your Poetics subscription by sending a message to "listserv."


set poetics nomail

& turn it on again with: set poetics mail

When you return you can check or download missed postings from the Poetics
archive. (See 8 below.)

____________________________________________________________________

6. Who's Subscribed

To see who is subscribed to Poetics, send an e-mail message to
listserv@ubvm.cc.buffalo.edu; leave the "Subject" line of the e-mail message
blank.  In the body of your e-mail message type:

  review poetics

You will be sent within a reasonable amount of time (by return e-mail) a
rather long list containing the names and e-mail addresses of Poetics
subscribers.  This list is alphabetized by server not name.

Please do not send a message to the list asking for the address of a
specific subscriber.
____________________________________________________________________

7. What is the Electronic Poetry Center?

our URL is

http://writing.upenn.edu/epc

The mission of this World-Wide Web based electronic poetry center is to
serve as a hypertextual gateway to the extraordinary range of activity in
formally innovative writing in the United States and the world.  The Center
provides access to the burgeoning number of electronic resources in the new
poetries including RIF/T and other electronic poetry journals, the POETICS
List archives, an AUTHOR library of electronic poetic texts, and direct
connections to numerous related electronic
RESOURCES. The Center also provides information about contemporary print
little magazines and SMALL PRESSES engaged in poetry and poetics. And we
have an extensive collection of soundfiles of poets' reading their work, as
well as the archive of LINEbreak, the radio interview series.

The EPC is directed by Loss Pequen~o Glazier.
____________________________________________________________________

8. Poetics Archives via EPC

Go to the EPC and select Poetics from the opening screen. Follow the
links to Poetics Archives. You may browse the archives by month and
year or search them for specific information. Your interface will
allow you to print or download any of these files.

Or set your browser to go directly to:
http://writing.upenn.edu/epc/poetics/archive

____________________________________________________________________

9. Publishers & Editors Read This!

PUBLISHERS & EDITORS: Our listings of poetry and poetics information is open
and available to you. We are trying to make access to printed publications
as easy as possible to our users and ENCOURAGE you to participate! Send a
list of your press/publications to
lolpoet@acsu.buffalo.edu with the words EPC Press Listing in the subject
line. You may also send materials on disk. (Write file name, word processing
program, and Mac or PC on disk.) Send an e-mail message to the address above
to obtain a mailing address to which to send your disk. Though files marked
up with html are our goal, ascii files are perfectly acceptable. If your
word processor ill save files in Rich Text Format (.rtf) this is also highly
desirable

Send us extended information on new publications (including any back cover copy
and sample poems) as well as complete catalogs/backlists (including excerpts
from reviews, sample poems, etc.).  Be sure to include full information for
ordering--including prices and addresses and phone numbers both of the press
and any distributors.

Initially, you might want to send short anouncements of new publications
directly to the Poetics list as subscribers do not always (or ever) check the
EPC; in your message please include full information for ordering.  If you have
a fuller listing at EPC, you might also mention that in any Poetics posts.

Some announcements circulated through Poetics and the EPC have received a
noticeable responses; it may be an effective way to promote your publication
and we are glad to facilitate information about interesting publications.

Well, not the literary ones, Charles, that's for sure. I learned early,
though I didnt know the terminology, that there were in the genre of
westerns, all the range of writing-strategies elsewhere. I liked, or said I
did, Max Brand the best, and know that he was a representative of the
Romantic impulse, especially in the Silvertip series, and I pity any man
who didnt read those as a boy. I knew about 2 women in my life who liked
westerns, by the way. The hardboiled realist angle was fronted by Luke
Short, and I liked him, too. Also Evan Evans, who was also Peter Dawson,
etc. Ernest Haycox. E.E. Halleran. Walt Coburn. Bliss Lomax. Wayne D.
Overholser. Frank O,Rourke.

Dear everyone and all.  I am to the MLA going to give a paper and cannot
afford to pay for a hotel room.  Is there anyone there already who has a

Dear Loss or Charles,
                    Can you help Tony out with this address--he's off
the List at the moment?
                    Thanks.

Hello   Wystan        Cd you find out for me on the Poetics list the
addrsss of the Marvin Sackler Archive (of concrete and visual poetry
I think it is) Florida.  They used to subscribe to Splash.

Reason is Tara McLeod phoned last night to say he's printing  a poem
I sent him for his project of a foldout book (15 pages) and the
Sackler shd be a buyer, I guess.

I think this counts as a book he's publishing, so I will be able to
shave
off my beard.


best

Tony Green,

Greetings,
     The Reseau de solidarite avec le Mexique-(Montreal) {Mexico
Solidarity Network} is an organisation that has been working consistently
for the last two years to educate about and support, principally, the
Zapatista movement in Chiapas, Mexico, and well as the broader social
movement. We have a homepage with lots of information about Mexico,
outdated stuff about our group, EZLN communiques, and lots of links to
other solidarity groups. Check it out.

Marjorie,

What precisely would you say?

I'm certainly up for doing something. But it feels profoundly
frustrating. Without the UN as a truly international force with
legitimacy to go in and simply sweep out the war criminals and hold
apart factions who've been at odds for so many centuries that nobody
really remembers why they are doing this to one another (which, in a
way, is exactly what the Stalinist regimes did both in Yugoslavia and
the old USSR), what moves would you recommend?

One of the great tragedies of the post-soviet period has been the
unmasking of the impotence and disfunctionality of the UN, due in no
small part to the very negative role that the US has played for many
years. Clinton kowtowing to Jesse Helms by putting the kibosh on
Boutros-Ghali makes me cringe.

This of course being the same administration that puts everything on
the line with China over software piracy but looks the other way at
human rights and child labor abuses.

Suggest what we would/should say.

----------------------

It's only a slightly different thread here to wonder how Adorno's line
must sound now in Serbia? Bosnia? Chechnya? Zaire?

Right at the end of the time when I worked in the Tenderloin in San
Francisco (1977-81), there were many Kampuchean people moving into the
neighborhood. In addition to Pol Pot and his practices, those who made
it out went through horrific experiences getting away. Eighty-five
percent of the women had been raped by pirates.

What makes us think we live in anything other than the dark ages?

-----------------------

On a lighter note, I want to thank Mark and Mark and William Marsh for
their remarkably thoughtful posts on the relationship of teaching to
their lives as writers. Those pieces illuminated just what this list
can do at its finest. Thanks,

Ron Silliman

bill marsh, how to say this w/o somehow alienating you and others?...

when i read yr post, much as i'm in sympathy with what you say, and much as
i sense your conflictedness, i also feel that somehow you've managed
(though it may just be me, and my hypersensitivity to certain issues) to
sidestep an important aspect of the changes underway throughout academe...

for example:  when you suggest that you're really not quite sure you *want*
to be part of the professoriate, what i hear is both a critique of the
current state of the professoriate (which is fine) AND an endorsement of
the "contingent" workforce that, as i see it, is symptomatic of broader
economic realities (which is, well, not so fine)...

another example:  when you suggest that teaching returning students is an
increasingly important aspect of academe, what i hear is both recognition
of these returning students as worthy of our attention as faculty (which is
fine) AND endorsement of the administrative zeal with which so many
postsecondary institutions are busy colonizing these (and this is right out
of some local promo lit) "serious educational consumers"...

bill:  what happens to teaching---in the classroom---when educational
administrators know they've got a contingent faculty workforce that they
can effectively push around to meet "consumer" needs?... what, exactly,
does it mean to teach returning students who are returning less b/c they
want an education and more b/c they want a *credential*?... and what does
it mean when such returning students are 'empowered' *as consumers*?...
what does it mean, for that matter, when *any* student is so empowered?...

even more:  what's *wrong* with a full-time faculty position, with a
reasonable course load (3/3, say), a reasonable wage (let's say $40,000 a
year to start, in a mid-size city), good institutional support and
benefits, and some academic freedom to teach students (or if you like,
"promote learning"), a position that isn't keyed to vocationalizing or
credentializing objectives?...  what's wrong with an approach to writing,
specifically, that isn't, again, functionalized in terms of "effective
communication" and the like?... or to put it another way:  what could
possibly be RIGHT with teaching alphabetic technologies strictly in such
terms?... even seymour papert, with whom i find mself consistently
disagreeing, at least values the alphabet as a means of control---which
would require a rather sophisticated notion of same in order to achieve
various sorts of literacies...

and wrt writing in particular:  nothing against the entire wac/wpa movement
in itself, but fact is (just read the mla jil) these positions are more and
more customarily being described as *administrative* positions...
wpa---writing program administrator---is in fact just that, but the way
this latter is being conceived is more and more in admin. terms... the
opening on my campus, at this moment, is in fact *half-time admin*... and
this is a tenure-track position, which leads me to ask how tenure will be
construed for such an individual... but in any case:  much as with attempts
to unionize engineers in the 20s and 30s in this country, by opening up
tenure-track lines that are primarily administrative, the "company"
effectively encourages a different sort of loyalty---one to the
institution, not to the profession (in the case of engineering, it was a
shift out of engineering and into management that helped to compromise
unionizing efforts)... one can perhaps understand why i'm eager to hold on
to the category of the professional, but in any case it should be clear
that writing is in fact the academic rubric under which this administrative
push is taking place... no, it doesn't have to be this way---but if it *is*
this way, it's b/c writing has generally found itself on the bottom of the
disciplinary totem pole wrt english studies... anyway, breaking writing off
from literature, though it may be a wise thing to do on some campuses,
opens it up for admin. colonizing...

in an age of soi-disant excellence in education (and this is clearly our
age), the goals of the institution are likely to be extremely exclusive...
this has happened before (in this century, in the u.s.), but perhaps never
with such overwhelming corporate influence... what i'm saying, bill, is
that while i want very much to support *you* in your work and teaching, as
a colleague, i'd also like to be able to get you over into the full-time
faculty workforce with, say, me! (and i've already talked about how
un-utopian my position is, so please don't hear this as a condescension)...
but in order to do so, it's gonna take some attention to the realities that
are being forced down our collective throats---we're gonna have to be
willing to change these realities...

please excuse any residual harshness or one-sidedness here, i'm trying to
flesh out more a feeling i get in reading over your post...

all best,

joe

Subject:      The Academic Career?
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: Text/Plain; Charset=US-ASCII

This list is on its 3d or greater way around the list of topics, alas,
one of its problems (for me, I mean). In particular the question of the
academy as a career for poets was shaken like a dirty carpet for a
month or more at least two years ago, with extensive and strongly felt
contributions by me and by Ron.

Someone might want to go back and take a look.

I taught at the University of Chicago and the University of Illinois in
the sixties -- when I was a fledgeling grad student. I was on my way to
an academic career and quite clear on the attractions and advantages.
Attractions included above all that there are few careers which pay you
to read books. I like to read books. And fewer still that offer the
hours offered to teachers. Teaching, while you do it, is hard wor--
performance work. But, from experience, not as hard as waiting tables,
and you wait tables longer hours.

If you actually have something to teach -- that is, you are a master
and have something to pass along (please remember that this was the
original model for the relationship upon which these institutions have
been erected) -- and you are drawn to pass it along, i.e. if teaching
is a calling, why then it is a noble one to be sure.

The academy has *nothing whatever* to do with poetry -- zero. If
anything it seems to have a pretty generally negative effect on poets.
I don't mean teaching does, teaching is a job, I mean committing to the
academic career.

Small ponds breed vicious competitive frogs -- any doubts of this
axiom?

There are really many interesting things to do in the world. Most of
them, in my experience, take more intelligence and imagination than the
academic career, are more rewarding both in the experience and effect
of accomplishing something and more rewarding financially than a career
in the academy.

With notable exceptions -- including Perloff, Nielsen and other friends
on this list, and many others too, I don't mean to be a pig -- I have
not found that the academy attracts a particularly high brand of
intelligence; it's not, in other words, a place to go because you like
to be around smart people.

Hence, if it's hard to get an academic job, and above all if you intend
to write a poetry that occupies the largest world you can identify --
why not quit grad school, all of you who are grad students. Young
professors among you, look for something else to do.

The reason fly paper works, it attracts flies. Next subject.

Tom

My own feeling at having completed a creative writing
Ph.D using models from Antin to LangPo (which was not
welcomed!) at an English university: is, I used the
time to experiment, and I'm really glad that the
resulting experiment is "in the public domain" ie
available on the shelfs of my university library,
but I don't want to see it in print more widely;
I prefer to be represented more widely by the few
pamphlets I've been asked to do. It seems odd to me
that creative writing postgard courses are not
advertised ot framed as a place to experiment, and
to think about writing, and how amateur writing
might be good for people, and how we discourage
anyone from doing writing if we go on about "who's
a writer, who isn't" - sometimes by thinking we're
doing big, publishable, fame-making, critically
acclaimed, writing, we do our best personal work,
using writing in a process of personal growth.
I believe history will judge who had the right to
call themselves writers just from doing a course
or whatever.

Karl,

One more after-point: I would like to imagine that the PhD in whatever
discipline really means something. So, let us suppose that some school,
some dept, some group of professors, views the exploding writing industry
(how many graduate writing programs are there these days? Answer:  A whole
lot.) as an opportunity for them to create a real cash cow that will please
their provost and upper administration in general; indeed, the cash cow can'

even pay for other programs, worthy programs though ones that may not be
paying for themselves (the financial bottom line is NOT the criterion
for deciding moral,scholarly,artistic worth, despite what many university
presses, for instance, seem to have come round to believing these days).  So
they set up a PhD program in creative writing; after all, think of all those
MFAs who, having now earned their writer's accreditation, need something to
do, somewhere to go to meet with other writers and so on.  But a PhD program
has to justify itself by having students, right.  The problem here is, what
is the guarantee that this program will accept students with talent only?
I ask this question because, unlike the world of scholarship, there is no
other system in our society for scholars to operated in except the university
system--whereas the "creative writer" can possibly thrive in the world of
publishing (either small or big press, small or big magazine, through well
known or obscure writing competitions).

S.F. poet arrested in fatal shooting

Suspect Janice Duff a North Beach fixture since 1960s

Jim Herron Zamora
OF THE EXAMINER STAFF

        A North Beach poet and longtime member of The City's
        coffeehouse beat scene has been arrested for allegedly
        shooting a man to death at the home where she was staying,
        police said.

        Janice Duff, whose poetry is published under the name Janice
        Blue, was arrested on suspicion of murdering William Dyble,
        58, on Sunday morning in the home on Water Street off
        Columbus Avenue, homicide Lt. David Robinson said.

        Police said the killing apparently stemmed from a drunken
        fit of anger on the part of Duff.

        "She had been drinking heavily," he said. "For some reason,
        she became upset with him. She got a gun and shot him."

        Police say Duff also threatened Judy Smith, a female
        companion of Dyble's who ran out of the home and called 911.

        Duff, 54, was arrested outside without resistance. Although
        she gave a statement to police, "what she said was
        unintelligible," Robinson said.

        Dyble, a retired longshoreman, died at 6:30 p.m. at San
        Francisco General Hospital. Investigators found what they
        believe was the gun used to kill him.

        Duff was being held without bail at San Francisco County
        Jail. She may be arraigned Tuesday or Wednesday.

        Duff is well-known among local poets and has been active in
        North Beach for many years. But several people interviewed
        Monday said they had lost touch with her in recent years.

        "I can't believe this," said Duff's former publisher, Kay
        McDonough of Connecticut. "She's a gentle, loving person. It
        just seems beyond all for her to harm anyone." McDonough's
        company, Greenlight Press, published a book of Duff's poems
        in 1978 titled "Good Old No-Man's Land." McDonough, who was
        then based in San Francisco, knew Duff from the North Beach
        poetry scene and frequently shared the stage with her during
        coffeehouse readings.

        In a short autobiographical section of her book, Duff said
        she was born Janice Faye Adams, the daughter of a tobacco
        farmer in the "extreme western edge of Kentucky." The family
        moved to St. Louis when she was 15.

        She dropped out of high school after two years and gave
        birth to a daughter, she said. Then she "dropped into" the
        beatnik scene in St. Louis for a few years before moving to
        San Francisco in 1962.

        In the early 1960s she took up poetry and decided to wear
        blue exclusively. She began using the name "Blue" or "Janice
        Blue."

        "I wear only that color," she wrote in the 1970s. "It is my
        aspect and my slant in life as in poetry."

        Although she's made The City her home for some 30 years,
        Duff has spent several stints in New Orleans and has
        described herself as a veteran cross-country traveler.

        "She's a very old-style Bohemian kind of lady," McDonough
        said. "She used to travel around with her guitar. She really
        has a gift. She writes in kind of a magical vein."

        Her work contains both fanciful and gritty paeans to The
        City, especially North Beach and its cafe culture. She also
        wrote of birds talking to St. Francis about the strangeness
        of humans.

        "She's a great folk poet," said Jack Mueller, an Oakland
        poet active in the North Beach scene. "This is really
        unbelieveable. She's a very sweet woman."

I'm still having trouble here, and can't help but feel this argument
about the "taste economy" is a distraction.  There's something I want to
get at, in the grey area between what Wystan says about the necessity of
making aesthetic choices and what Eliza says about speaking as a Master
of the Textual Universe.  I can't focus on it.  On the one hand, I love
the way Sam Spade says, "I don't anything about that" when asked about
something he knows nothing about.  Good.  Don't pretend to knowledge you
don't have.  Don't speak as a Master if you aren't, and as Eliza says,
who can be nowadays?  But artists seem always to be doing something that
_looks_ like this.  Frost & Yeats were famously dismissive of free
verse.  Frost & Stevens were famously dismissive of each other.  ("The
trouble with you, Robert, is that you write about _things_."  "The
trouble with you, Wallace, is that you write about bric-a-brac.")  Now
what counts as knowledge?  How much did Yeats need to know about free
verse to know he hated it, as he hated the look of modern Dublin?  Is he
wrong?  His ideas are not the same as mine.  (Eliot thought that was the
wonderful thing about Yeats, that young people had in their midst a
demonstrably great poet whose ideas they could not share.)  Are Frost's
and Stevens's remarks about each other meaningless?  I tend to think
not.  Neither one was an idiot.  There's something to these dismissals.

George & Mary Oppen printed _Spring & All_ by hand, more or less, in
France.  Charles Reznikoff published himself.  I don't remember if he
set some of his own type, as Whitman had.  Robt. Creeley published
Olson's _Mayan Letters_ himself, and a lot more besides.  It was DIY.
Are these issues of a "majority culture" and "repressed minorities"?
Apparently not.  They might be issues of taste & its economy, I dunno.

I don't want to argue about the nature of culture.  I don't want to see
another Pound war on this list, I was here for the last one.

There's a story someone tells about sitting around in a bar maybe with a
bunch of poets (and maybe this was a poem, I don't remember) and our
storyteller says something approving of a poem by Whitman, and everyone
roars -- except James Schuyler, who says, "I think that is a _beautiful_
poem."  What's the received view of Whitman?  Here's a don at Oxford who
says Milton is the finest poet ever to grace the English language with
his benificent invention; here's a don at Cambridge says he's the next
thing to a fraud.  What's the received view of Milton?  Why do American
philosophy departments teach Kant but not Emerson?  Why don't they teach
Bradley anymore?  Are these questions of taste or fashion?

So you decide to find out for yourself.  What happens?  If you read
Amira Baraka all on your own for the first time, and you think, "Jesus!
This guy can write!" -- that is, if you respond immediately, without any
effort to rethink your own tastes, and if you've had classes where the
writings of his white friends were taught (now this is hypothetical),
then maybe you have an explanation for why no one had put the book in
your hands before.  And it might change the way you look at your
professors.

Sometimes you don't respond immediately, and no simple explanation for a
writer's exclusion comes to hand.  Creeley tells this story about his
learning to appreciate Whitman and many of us could probably tell a
similar story.  Whitman, these days, for many of us, seems to take a
while.  It's a nice story; here's the whole thing (fair use?):

"I remember a course I took with F. O. Matthiessen, surely a man of deep
commitment and care for his students [and gay, which might be relevant
infra --PF], from which [Hart] Crane had been absented.  I asked for
permission to give a paper on Crane, which he gave me, but I had
overlooked what I should have realized would be the response of the
class itself, understandably intent upon its own sophistications.  How
would they accept these lines, for example?

                                        yes, Walt,
        Afoot again, and onward without halt,--
        Not soon, nor suddenly,--no, never let go
                My hand
                        in yours,
                                Walt Whitman--
                                        so--

If they did not laugh outright at what must have seemed to them the
awkwardly stressed rhymes and sentimental camaraderie, then they
tittered at Crane's will to be one with his fellow _homosexual_.  But
didn't they hear, I wanted to insist, the pacing of the rhythms of those
lines, the syntax, the intently human tone, or simply the punctuation?
Couldn't they read?  Was Crane to be simply another 'crudity' they could
do glibly be rid of?"

Pause.  What's the explanation for Creeley's ability to read Hart Crane,
when his classmates couldn't?  Continuing:

                        "But still I myself didn't read Whitman, more
than the few poems of his that were 'dealt with' in classes or that some
friend asked me to.  No doubt I was embarrassed by my aunt's and my
grandmother's ability to recite that terrible poem, "O Captain!  My
Captain!" banal as I felt it to be, and yet what was that specious taste
which could so distract my attention and could righteously dismiss so
much possibility, just because it didn't 'like' it?  Sadly, it was too
much my own.
        "So I didn't really read Whitman for some years although from
time to time I realized that the dispositions toward his work must be
changing.  Increasing numbers of articles began to appear as, for one
example, Randall Jarrell's "Whitman Revisited".  But the import of this
writing had primarily to do with Whitman's work as instance of social
history or else with its philosophical basis or, in short, with all that
did not attempt to respect the technical aspects of his writing, his
prosody and the characteristic method of his organization within the
specific poems.
        "It was, finally, the respect accorded to Whitman by three of my
fellow poets that began to impress me as not only significant to their
various concepts of poetry but as unmistakable evidence of his basic use
to any estimation of the nature of poetry itself."

I was going to stop sooner, but I want to talk a bit about this part so
here it is:

"I had grown up, so to speak, habituated to the use of poetry as
compact, epiphanal instance of emotion or insight.  I valued its
intensive compression, its ability to 'get through' a maze of conflict
and confusion to some center clear 'point'.  But what did one do if the
emotion or terms of thought could not be so focused upon or isolated in
such singularity?"

Alright, I'll stop finally.  The three poets were Ginsberg, Duncan &
Zukofsky.  This is all from RC's introduction to the Penguin _Selected
Whitman_.  (I get it from an o.p. collection, _Was That a Real Poem &
other essays_, Four Seasons.  It may be around elsewhere.)

An interesting story, to me, interesting at least in how typical it must
be of all such stories, and interesting in that Creeley finally reads
Whitman in an act of reconsidering poetry itself.  (And that fellow
poets play a crucial role.)  He does not indicate that he had done this
with Hart Crane, but maybe he had, and had done it earlier, before his
ideas about poetry were so fixed as to exclude Whitman so decisively.
Maybe there's always a re-evaluation of poetry in reading each poet you
really connect with.  And maybe Crane's and Whitman's homosexuality had
something to do with their status in academia.  It doesn't seem to have
had much to do with Creeley's different routes to their poetry.

Does Creeley have a similar story about Edgar Guest?  No.  And the
reasons he can dismiss Edgar Guest are the same as the reasons he could
hear Hart Crane, I would think, and maybe why he was prepared for
Whitman once the scales were lifted from his eyes.  Not all exclusions
are the same.  But it's worth going over what happens with Whitman.  It
wasn't just some skittishness about homosexuality or sentimentality or
anything so simple as that he had to overcome: it was a conviction about
the nature of poetry, and one that he was in some sense "bred" to.  One
would think this was exactly the sort of thing we were talking about
here.  It's certainly what I've been wanting to talk about.

I'm not sure I can see what cultural structure that idea Creeley had
about poetry was part of.  And I'm not sure he analysed its context in
order to free himself of it.  He found his way within poetry & ideas
about poetry.  Maybe that's just characteristic of him; he professes
that Whitman as history or philosophy didn't swing the balance, and that
it took poets reading Whitman as a poet, and a good craftsman in some
sense.

That's a long story about taste, and coming to accept, more than accept
but be changed by, a poet that taste had excluded.  And what happens to
that taste, to the old ideal of the compact, focused, epiphany poem?  I
wonder.  Creeley's poems seem somehow to draw on both ideas.  It's
almost eerie to read his descriptions of these ideas in turn, and see
how they both "fit" what he himself came to do.  What does he think of
poems that are cut to fit the old pattern?  I don't know.  Maybe he
still appreciates them within their given aesthetic.  He has remarked,
apropos of poetry slams, that not all poetry has to go in the same box,
that poetry is various.  I hope I've given no indication of thinking
otherwise.

But this is an important moment -- what happens to the old ideal?  I'm
struggling with it myself, having been thrust into contact lately with
some poetry of Robert Lowell and Seamus Heaney, and finding I don't like
it.  I used to.  And I like some poets now I used to not, and many more
that used to just puzzle me.  I've been feeling a strong urge to
canonize my lately come to heritage -- not for everybody, but as where I
belong.  And that means not exactly dismissing but missing the appeal of
a lot of other poetries.  Or at least, I've been trying to keep from
investigating _everything_ as I used to.  It's tempting to go back and
reread and try to fix my changing aesthetic by comparative methods.
Tempting to study Jorie Graham's latest and situate myself in
opposition.  What is it here I don't like?  Very tempting but I have
this feeling I could learn more by focusing on what does appeal to me,
and simply staying away from what doesn't.

(The university library where I used to go to school had what may have
been a complete set of Robert Peters's volumes of criticism, The Great
American Poetry Bake-off series.  I used to pore over those even though
I liked a lot that he skewered and didn't get a lot that he praised to
the skies.  But I liked his freshness.  (Anybody read any of this stuff?
I haven't read any of his poems.)  I liked his resistance to reputation,
the way he seemed to read each book, even or especially by poets he had
praised in the past, as if it had arrived anonymously on his desk.  Not
that he could, but he seemed to be able to calibrate his filters to
screen out the reputation.  I still remember those books.  That's a
critic.)

Now with Creeley -- what do you suppose he read after Whitman?  Maybe he
could still "appreciate" poems that approximated that sort of New
Critical lyric ideal he alludes to, but do you suppose he sought out
such poems?  Isn't there often a sort of "effective dismissal" in what
you spend your time doing?  That is, in what you commit your limited
life's energy to.  Those commitments have a lot to do with change.
Pound is always desperately trying to correct his own education.  A sort
of "lies my teacher told me" phenomenon.  I understand that this is
exactly where the motivation of cultural studies comes from.  Reading
Gaudier Brzeska (quoted by Pound) this afternoon on my lunch break, it
reminded me of nothing so much as A Thousand Plateaus.  It's curious,
that similarity, as is the similarity to say Marshall McLuhan.

Digression 31:  Something I love in Wittgenstein, and why I am so drawn
to him sometimes, is the way he says what's needed -- maybe not that,
but at any rate, what we lack -- is what one pair of translators call
happily a "bird's eye view" or our language, an uebersichtliche
Darstellung of it.  Wittgenstein is a good read on the necessity and
impossibilty of the ideal, the description of behaviour in terms of
rules, thought in terms of logic, etc.  These things are not quite what
they claim to be, what they are claimed to be by philosophers, but they
are not simply delusions or ideology of some kind either.  They are in
some way intrinsic to language.  And I'm thinking that the overreaching
judgments of poets & critics, the seeming pretense of being Master of
the Textual Universe, is something similar.  An attempt at a bird's eye
view.  Maybe what Pound was after.  I read just today, EP saying, "That
many scholars write under a terror.  They are forced to maintain a
pretence of omniscience.  This leads to restricting their field of
reference."  Slightly different emphasis, but very close to what Eliza
McGrand was saying, but from here he heads at the demon specialization.
And yesterday he said, "About thirty years ago, seated on one of the
very hard, very slippery, thoroughly uncomfortable chairs of the British
Museum main reading room, with a pile of large books at my right hand
and a pile of somewhat smaller ones at my left hand, I lifted my eyes to
the tiers of volumes and false doors covered with imitation bookbacks
which surround that focus of learning.  Calculating the eye-strain and
the number of pages per day that a man could read, with deduction for
say at least 5% of one man's time for reflection, I decided against it.
There must be some other way for a human being to make use of that vast
cultural heritage."  Indeed, what are we to do?

Two days rambling.  My way of asking for enlightenment.

a coupl of thoughts on this line of writing after Aushwitz.  first,
arendt did say that, as well as Adorno, though I can't remember where
(big help, i know).  Also, all of her talk about the alternatives to
violence (as her example, that of the late sixties) demonstrates the
difficulty of negotiating between the horror of totalitarianism and
the desire for retribution -- a crux that pushes her to find "reason"
as the answer (though I'm bothered by her lack of grappling with
the question of whose "reason" this might be).

Also, what about Maurice Blanchot's book, _Writing the Disaster_, a
newly revised edition came out last year, though I've not yet had a
chance to look at it.  Anyone?

Just some thoughts.

Yes indeed, Jordan, I heard that (& was going to mention it in my post
re the new-found poem of Blaise Cendrars, but then forgot) & thanks for
bringing it up -- the news in fact made me take down & reread that
gorgeous late sixties Mushinsha/Grossman edition of Basho's
OKU-NO-HOSOMICHI as translated by Cid Corman  & Kamaike Susumu. The find
does correspondent culturally to something like discovering the
hand-written diaries of Shakespeare with first sketches of his plays...

I find nothing in Eliza's definition which would discount writers like acker
or ohara. In fact, I think "attention" is a very good word to characterize
much of ohara. Attention does not require isolation to be deep. In Ohara's
case it often seems to be immediate, but no less stunning, as craft, in
being so. I don't see anything in the definition about isolation, just about
attention, commitment, care. I find such qualities absolutely present in
acker & ohara.

tom, i think these ideas *must* be recycled, simply b/c this is the sort of
conversational space that hasn't been available to discuss postsecondary ed
(and so many other things)... so i'll recycle here a bit, incl. your post:

though i understand your *sentiment* re academe (being a latecomer mself),
i just don't think the whole kit & caboodle should be blown-off so casually
(and your remarks strike me as a bit casual), not even wrt poetry and
poets... there's just too much at stake in the educational system, and i'd
like to think that, even were i to leave, i would see the importance of it,
whatever its problems...

i don't think the "brand of intelligence" in academe constitutes its
problem... its problems, as i see them, have much more to do with
structural issues, not individual personality types...

but it's in *coming to* the educational system that i think i may differ
from you most significantly:  i don't know your personal story, but mine
has a lot to do with trying to find *somegoddamnplace* to go after years of
working in industry, supporting my father, etc---a place that would provide
me with a little space, is all, in which i could perhaps do something that
*does* have (flypaper or no) all sorts of social significance...

learning, i mean, and helping others learn... is this not, on the surface
of it anyway, a [gulp] noble profession?... while i don't (think i) endorse
your ideas about "masters" or "callings" or such like, surely we can agree
that learning institutions are important social institutions?...

(and btw, on a related note, academic sop here: in the past year, there's
been yet another compendium of essays published on the status of academics
from the working class---this is an emerging and evolving discourse... see
c. l. barney dews & carolyn leste law, eds., _this fine place so far from
home:  voices of academics from the working class_ (temple up, 1995))...

now i don't think learning, whatever it is, is without its conflictedness
(on my part, and others around here) but at the same time, i don't think
that airing and confronting these difficulties, all bound up as they are
with late-20th-century intellectual engagement in general, necessarily
means that they're somehow less important... i really did get this feeling
reading over your post, tom... i mean, just 'cause us academics, aspiring
profs. or whatever, got all sortsa problems with our institutions and are
willing to discuss same is no reason (WHATEVER one's personal history) to
suggest we're necessarily better off seeking gainful employment
elsewhere...

i mean, if you're talking survival, well then sure... but if you're talking
social value, well then i'm not so sure... if you're lucky enough to get a
decent teaching job, why then why not? (and to reiterate what aldon
sd---there's a real need for more profs in english---if only we could do
away with the logic of writing courses capped at 35 students)...

in any case, i've spent some real time elsewhere, in another part of the
real world, which was no more real than academe---in some ways it was
better, in some worse...
it was different, and from day 1 through day 2600 or so, not for me (though
i did my best)... this is part of "my story"... and this elsewhere -- i
often found it none too pleasant or redeeming---albeit i'll grant, again,
that academe is no model community...

best,

joe

This is an understatement.  I moved to San Francisco during the height of
JB's celebrity.  My boyfriend at the time was a street artist at
Fisherman's Wharf, an occupation I found very romantic (but he didn't, he
never said the word "tourist" without prefacing it with the word "fucking".
I remember one day when he and I were hanging out in North Beach, this
woman walked by, tall in my memory, with large white-blonde hair, and this
day-glo royal blue knee-length cape and hat to match.  Bruce said to me in
a very un-Bruce-like, awelike manner, "That's Janice Blue."

I never knew anything about her poetry.  I'd just occasionally see her on
the streets and stop in my tracks, dazed.

Robert Peters has shown his blind spots as well.  I remember him causing
quite a fury among the editors of _How(ever)_ when he wrote of them
somewhere (this is such old gossip I can't remember the specifics)
something like:

"What do these ladies talk about as they sit around sipping tea."

I once went to a performance of his Countess Bathory piece (the great
female vampire prototype) and he picked me out of the audience to be the
young virgin and proceeded to direct much of his overtop campy performance
directly at me.  Though I felt this was an honor of sorts, I wanted to
crawl under my chair.

Does anyone know much about the origins of the poetry-placards which
occassionally appear in subways and buses, a la Poetry in Motion, that has made
its way to Boston via NYC?  I remember that a similar public-display venture
appeared in Chicago buses in the mid-80s, and have heard that the practice
began in San Francisco sometime in the 70s.  I first was glad to see them, now
I am less so, probably because their intentions seem disingenuous.  Do they
grease the wheels of commerce?  Yes.  Do they work for the well-being of
commuters?  I don't know.

Interesting how these short poems, and more often fragments of poems,
accompanied by their pseudo-funky visual layout, work in terms of the textual
rhetoric of mass transporation space.  "Space" can be a product of actions, as
opposed to an already given environmental situation, and the act of reading is
one of the primary ways to create it.  The poems define a space inside the
moving compartment, one in which fantasy is licensed.  They seem to want to
provide a meditative focus for passengers: it's poetry to stare at, which
validates the official adminstration of privacy.  My inclination is to think
that the poems, sandwiched between ads, are intended to be considered in light
of their context.  What are those ads usually?  Around here, many for
vocational schools, and public-interest reminders.  The poems then are a kind
of counter-point to the utter usefulness of the adjacent texts; the poems are
supposedly ends in themselves.  Of course the trip is not.   But the supposed
mystery of the mass-trans. poems, even when they themselves ostensibly deny
aesthetic autonomy and suggest collaborative action, requires passengers to
read into their compartment a textual space that is predicated on uselessness.
This uselessness does not seem related to graffiti, but in contradiction to it.
And that contradiction seems to me to be a wearying struggle over inscribed
space in which commuters are unwitting agents.  But then again, maybe the
little poems relieve stress and keep one going forward...

well we read it differently.  ill agree that there is nothing to discount
the writers mentioned--only there is a qualitative difference not only
implied but stated in her post about the ontological difference of
aleatory/other writing and "craft" it seemed to me.  no attention does
not require isolation to be deep--but there was a residual romanticism in
her account of the poet/writer that just seems incompatible with
postmodern technologies of writing.  i dont think we disagree--just a
matter of attending to subtle shadings of meaning in her post.  perhaps i
should/could have excerpted her comments to more effect.  nevertheless....

postcard courses

post-guard courses

post-garde courses

I like to think of a university with a course teaching/encouraging the

would be an academy worth supporting. And everyone should receive such
postcards.

George is quite right about everything except the term "Apache Country,"
which was actually "Indian Country."  For an amazing rundown of how many
American soldiers died playing "Shootout at the OK Corral" with real
pistols, check out Bill Gibson's _The Perfect War: Technowar in Vietnam_.
(This is *not* the William Gibson of _Neuromancer_ fame.)  I've read about
eight hundred Viet Nam war novels and personal narratives and I can't think
of a single one that *doesn't* mention John Wayne.

I don't have Paul Carroll's poems at hand as I write this, but I do have
both books that Joe mentions below: _the poem in its skin_ and _the young
american poets_.

_the poem in its skin_ is still one of my favorite books about poetry. I
could wish somebody would bring it back into print. I'd see to it that my
students knew it. It was a Big Table book, as was _the young american
poets_. Big Table: from Carroll's student days at the University of Chicago
when he took the material he had collected, as editor, for an issue of the
_Chicago Review_ (including some early Ginsberg & co,) off campus under that
name when the administration moved to censor it.

What Carroll does, in _the poem in its skin_, is read in a quite
wonderful way one poem by each of several poets: Ashbery? Leaving the
Atocha Station, Creeley/ A Wicker Basket, Dickey (James)/The Heaven of
Animals, Gardner (Isabella)/The Widow's Yard, Ginsberg/Wichita Vortex
Sutra, Logan (John, who was my teacher at the University of Washington in
the middle 60s, before Buffalo)/A Century Piece for Poor Heine,
Merwin/Lemuel's Blessing, O'Hara/The Day Lady Died, Snodgrass/April
Inventory, and Wright (James)/As I Step Over a Puddle at the End of
Winter, I Think of an Ancient Chinese Governor...and a long general essay
called "Faire, Foul and Full of Variations: The Generation of 1962." -the
poem in its skin_ was published in 1968.

_the young american poets_ includes: Vito Hannibal Acconci, George
Amabile, Jon Anderson, Roger Aplon, James Applewhite, Gerald William
Barrax, Marvin Bell, Michael Benedikt, Bill Berkson, Ted Berrigan, Randy
Blasing, Harold Bond, Michael Brownstein, Tom Clark, Clark Coolidge,
Jonathan Cott, Kenward Elmslie, Kathleen Fraser, Louise Gluck, Robert
Hass, Philip Hey, William Hunt, Ronald Johnson, Robert Kelly, Richard
Kostelanetz, John L'Heureux, Lou Lipsitz, Lewis Mac Adams, Gerald
Malanga, Morton Marcus, Jack Marshall, Howard McCord, John Morgan, David
Mus, Ron Padgett, John Perreault, Saint Geraud, Aram Saroyan, Peter
Schjeldahl, Dennis Schmitz, Charles Simic, Kathleen Spivac, Mark Strand,
James Tate, Sotere Torregian, Tony Towle, Alden Van Buskirk, Allen Van
Newkirk, Julia Vinograd, Diane Wakoski, Anne Waldman, Lewis Warsh, James
Welch, and Tyner White. _the young american poets_ was published in 1968
too.

I have a poem of his in mind: "Father." Which I really like. I don't have
my copy of Donald Allen's Grove Press NAP Anthology, 1945-60, at hand
(either) as I write this, but I seem to remember that "Father" was in it.

Author:       Carroll, Paul
Title:        New and Selected Poems

Year:         1978

Subj (Forth): POETRY-POETIC-WORKS-BY-ONE-AUTHOR
Subj (Pbk):   LITERATURE-POETRY-GENERAL

Is apparently still in print and available, although I haven't seen it. I
never met Carroll, only admired his work as critic, poet, and anthologist
from a distance. I didn't read the piece in the Chicago Trib Magazine
that Joe refers to. If Paul Hoover is out there, reading this, or others
who knew Carroll, perhaps he/they'd be willing to add to this. I'd like
to know more, too, about his life and work.

hi jeffrey and charles.  am not sure why it would be presumed that i
discount acker and o'hara ("The Day Lady Died" makes me weep).  any
writer has what maxine kumin has called "donnees" (french -- accent on
2nd "e"), the "given" poems that blaze out suddenly.  but they come
from ATTENTION.  from working, keeping muscles limber.  cocktail
napkin poetry comes from profound inattention, disinterest.  it
arises from need of its author to prove how Brilliant/Witty/
Profound/(etc...)  he/she is; fixed attention on posturing only.  that
is not "craft," serious and engaged work, where some idea or thing
being giving focused attention and analysis through shaped phrases,
images, and lines.  good lord, acker is one of the most "attentive"
writers i know -- she writes from such an extraordinary focus --
seems both to hold a massive amount of information/text/ social
exchange, on idea in her head (gently, firmly both) and to focus
inward on her own unique path of thought and technique.  dazzling.

by "isolation," am sketching a counterpoint to the great Creative
Writing Program debate.  on the one hand, i can see a solid use to
creative writing programs, but on the other, many many fine writers
came to their craft WITHOUT such programs, without living "mentors"
(god i hate that word.  entrepreneur.  inappropriate.  accompany this
with sounds of cats retching out hairballs.).

when i see a wretched, meter-stumbling, ill-spelled (like i should
talk...)  patchwork of cliches with a few glistening images, i think
of the good a decent creative writing program could do the writer.
but when i see a homogenized, politically/old-boys Certified offering
produced by a CWP grad that takes no risks, hasn't much of anything to
say but "oh look at me and my dreadfully sensitive delicacy" noise, i
wish that writer had spent more time trying to please their ability
and preoccupations, and less time trying to please a writing class and
Famous Poet(s).  i've also read good work written from both approaches.

in other words, am sitting on the fence on this, but tipped, at
present, more towards writing from one's own impulses/energy with some
input from a few friends than toward writing programs and workshops.
the writer in isolation, by themselves, notion gets overused and badly
interpreted in a melodramatic, self-indulgent way.  but at certain
points (and maybe for some writers it is necessary for the whole of
their writing life), separation from popular literary opinion and
direction can be fertile ground.

i am going to disneyworld for four days (trip is a gift - could never
buy such a thing) and it is snowing like anything here -- there is
something surreal, possibly decadent, about packing swimsuits in a
blizzard...  perhaps i will write some "post gardes," perhaps sulk
alone at poolside and read byron (disgruntledly) ...

The latter trend is now occurring here in Japan -- not as a compromise but
rather an imposed condition.  Over the past several years, the vocational
school at which I am a full-time teacher has been offering hefty
"resignation incentive packages" to get full-time teachers to leave, while
at the same time hiring new teachers on 3-month temporary contracts (at
almost a third of the salary of some of the senior teachers).  Our school
is now threatening massive layoffs, a move which would decimate our union.
We are on the brink of serious confrontation with the administration.  As a
union composed mostly of "foreigners", we are considered eminently
expendable.

This is clearly an international rhyme to the situation in American
universities and in labor trends in general.

I have found my life here an interesting option to both the vicious small
pond of academia and the thrilling life of an entrepreneur that Tom
describes.  I get to *nobly* create the conditions for learning to take
place while staying away from the pinata scramble that I guess y'all will
see at the MLA.  But Japan is no longer the safe haven/gold mine it once
was.  The bubble has burst and ruthless Simon Legree capitalism now holds
sway.

So Tom, does that job offer still hold?

Taking a direction opposite to much of what I saw in the 80s, I moved
FROM working with computers TO teaching English -- Can't say that I saw a
demonstrably higher level of morality and/or intellect among the
off-campus professional with whom I worked --

(But then, a goodly number of the people I met at Wand in the early 80s
were former history grad. students -- fleeing a field that had it, even,
worse than English -- Wang proved not to be the best first choice for a
second career)

Can't see that there is an appreciably higher level of venality among the
professoriat of the beaneries than among the bean counters of business --

In fact, I had already moved from being a campus cop to working with
computers -- even with a cop's view of campus it didn't seem to me that
academia was any worse a place to work than elsewhere --

BTW -- anybody for the theory that the author of _Aerial and the Police_
really wanted to BE the police all along?

This attention to "attention" is giving me serious pangs of echo, wow,
sunrise! Mike Boughn's essays on Williams' prosody (thanks for sending
them, Mike) contrast the variable foot (which he appreciates precisely as
something like an 'elastic inch' -- comparing Williams to Einstein -- nice

Joe Amato's take and my own differ structurally. I came to the academy
early and easily, just moved along into it. I had no trouble getting a
job and no trouble seeing that I would continue having no trouble
getting such jobs (that "seeing" was done by a very young fellow and
would doubtless have been proved inaccurate and callow as most such is,
but it was also clear. There were no barriers to entry, as we say in
business, into this market).

Fortunately for the future, I'm essentially uninstitutionalizable --
not a boast, it's just my character. Perhaps just social genes (all my
forebears were poets and peddlers) or from the Holocaust which claimed
the greater part of my family -- those who survived did not communicate
an impulse to trust institutions.

Hence, when I find myself working in an institutional context, I
usually kick at the pricks and either quit or get fired. When I am
identified as part of a group, I usually do something to undercut that
identification. Right now, my friends in the academy are about to land
in Washington DC where I live. Hence, no doubt, my animadversions on
their career -- sorry, no hard feelings? I still love you.

Now, that *was* glib, the last two sentences I mean. But my previous
suggestions were not. No institution takes itself with quite the
overdose of seriousness of the academy.

Joe mistakes my position if he thinks me critical of either "learning"
or "teaching." Only I think less of it goes on in academic institutions
than (apparently) he does, and more of it goes on at the gas station
and in the check-out counter than (apparently) he does. How many on
this list understand how fuel injection works? What the structure is of
an upholstered piece of furniture? What's under the street you are
walking on? How a shoulder is set into a sportcoat? Oh yes, how much
learning went on in the Mathiesson class Pat Foley narrates? What
became of those narrow grad students who couldn't hear Crane? They are
teaching you today or taught your teachers.

Terms like "master" and "calling" I use *precisely because* they are
unfashionable (taste-less in another thread) -- this means they will
have some communicative force. Unlike, for example (and forgive me in
advance, Joe) "late-20th-century intellectual engagement" and "social
value."

Let me teach: if you don't have a model of the world you don't have an
intellectual position. Your job is not a matter of survival. I didn't
suggest that you "should seek gainful employment elsewhere." When you

A last word on that totally frustrating taste thread.

I read Wystan's post as being concerned with the relation of reading
to poetics, as trying to locate the dynamic that characterizes the
transformation of reading into a poetics. The unfortunate word he
chose to name that dynamic was taste--it could just as easily have
been Castaneda's word, "heart", or Freud's word , "cathexis". All of
them indicate a dynamic in which the text grabs your attention and
leads you beyond yourself into a world charged with orders of
meanings out of which poetry arises.

The response to Wystan's position was to beat him over the head with
Academic Master Narratives which explain all literature in a single
jargon laden paragraph, as if "taste" had some essential, unchanging
meaning, so you could just put the boots to it whenever you saw it
without having to ask what it meant, how it was being used
(Wittgenstein 101).

Personally, I could care less about explaining literature. Having a
poetics, however, as Jack Clarke used to point out, is a matter of
life and death. And this is a list purportedly dedicated to
discussions of poetics.

thanx bill for that information, very useful!... yes, part of "father" is
excerpted in the trib. piece (and mention is made of carroll's last volume,
_the beaver dam road poems_)... i wasn't aware that "father" was in the
allen anthology (the sole carroll poem there), and am typing this post
after having just read it... pretty tough piece, with a great sense of
place (here, where i type---chicago)... anyway, i'll be spending some time
in the library shortly to try to locate more of carroll's work...

Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

Joe,

Thanks for your remarks, which do, in fact,  reflect many of my recent
concerns about teaching in general, concerns amounting to something of a
crisis that has lead me to consider, quite seriously some days, finding
"something else to do", to use Tom Mandel's words in a parallel post.
Specifically:
>
>for example:  when you suggest that you're really not quite sure you *want*
>to be part of the professoriate, what i hear is both a critique of the
>current state of the professoriate (which is fine) AND an endorsement of
>the "contingent" workforce that, as i see it, is symptomatic of broader
>economic realities (which is, well, not so fine)...

not intended so much as an endorsement, although i see your point -- i
certainly don't endorse the "broader economic realities" of which
"contingent" work is a symptom, and agree that efforts should be made to
change those realities so that the academic interests you mention don't find
it so easy to "push us around".  My primary intention, though, in posting my
response to Mark Wallace was not so much to sidestep those realities or
endorse the contingent workforce, but rather to suggest that there is work
available for graduates who want to teach English at the college level.
You're correct to challenge me on the issue of "what happens to teaching--in
the classroom" when educational administrators know they have this
contingent faculty to manipulate. The other version of this question would
be "what happens to teachers" when trying to negotiate this current reality,
and how do they sustain any instructional zeal they may have entered the
field with when faced with the often debilitating influence of
administrative manipulation.  These are questions i'm currently asking
myself as well.

I can say that in my classroom the problem is paramount, for me as a teacher
who loves teaching, loves writing, and i have multiple solutions that
remain, no pun intended, contingent--ie, i take care to maintain, and
articulate to the students, a certain honesty about (1) my interests and
motivations as an educator and (2) the student's own motivations--both in
terms specific to the nature of the situation we *all* find ourselves in in
any given class, since generally, we're all being administered, not just the
teacher.  I'm not so sure the students i've met are "returning less b/c they
want an education and more b/c they want a *credential*," as you put it
(perhaps i gave the wrong impression), but in any event i try to make it
clear that the latter is not really an option anyway.  In other words, it
becomes a matter sometimes of "teaching what it means to learn," and this
usually creates a foundation on which learning becomes possible.  Could this
be one of the ways in which we (students and instructor alike) resist the
"colonizing" mechanism you speak of?--by saying/doing something to re-orient
motivations in such a way that classroom experiences are not just economic
exchanges between an exploited fringe worker and a colonized student
sub-set, but genuine group involvements, in the way i've traditionally
wanted the experience to be?   I would certainly agree that a teaching
position "keyed to vocationalizing or credentializing objectives" is not a
favorable position, for the part- or full-timer, and it's this
characterization that i resist in both your post and the academic
environment i currently inhabit.

 what's wrong with an approach to writing,
>specifically, that isn't, again, functionalized in terms of "effective
>communication" and the like?...

Nothing, of course, and i don't think i suggested there was -- it's an
approach i work hard to take, but since i work for an institution which does
functionalize it in these terms, the teaching is problematized in the way i
speak of generally above.  Hence, the crisis.

Again, i appreciate your taking me to task on these deeper issues, which i
decided not to bring up not because i was sidestepping, but rather because,
as i think i intimated at the conclusion of my first post, i'm not really
sure how to measure them.  Of course intellectual life as a "contingent
faculty" instructor is not all that appealing, in the end, but perhaps the
way to initiate the changes you call for is first to make it work for the
worker, the exact process for which, again, has not been discussed all that
much, at least not from my point of view.

I could say more, but have said enough.  Others?

As Buffalo University State at New York converts everything from teh old
vax servers to the old unix servers, there has been some difficulty on our
end. Do not adjust your computer! For some reason many messages get held
up (and aren't being processed)--I have sent the "free poetics" message
many times and was not heard by the mainframe. Lost in cyberspatial
suspension, my message floated, like many of yours, in an etherial world
of magic blips.

Subject:      Adorno and Serbia
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

Rachel Blau Duplessis is right, it was Adorno: "After Auschwitz, it is no
longer possible to write poems." He wrote this in 1949, in "After
Auschwitz" in Negative Dialectics, trans. E.B. Ashton. New York, Continuum
Publishing Co., 1973.

Shoshana Felman, speaking of the necessity for art to de-esthetize itself,
points out in her article on "Education and Crisis," in Imago vol. 48 Sring
1991, that Adorno later wrote (see "Commitment," in The Essential Frankfurt
School Reader, 1962): "The esthetic principle of stylization...make(s) an
unthinkable fate appear to have had some meaning; it is transfigured,
something of its horror is removed. This alone does an injustice to the
victims... [Some] works...are even willingly absorbed as contributions to
clearing up the past."

But more to the point here, he revisits his earlier statement: "I have no
wish to soften the saying that to write lyric poetry after Auschwitz is
barbaric... But Enzensberger's retort also remains true, that literature
must resist this verdict..."

Also Charles Bernstein's "The Second War and Postmodern Memory," in
Apoetics: "For to understand how Heidegger could be complicit in the Second
War is to understand how the Second War is not an aberration but an
extension of the Logos of Western Civilization. Jack Spicer's dying words
-- "My vocabulary did this to me" -- could be the epitaph of the Second War
as well: Our vocabulary  did this to us."

In his 1949 text, Adorno also said, "If thinking is to be true -- if it is
to be true today, in any case -- it must be thinking against itself. If
thought is not measured by the extremity that eludes the concept, it is
from the outset in the nature of the musical accompaniment with which the
SS liked to drown out the sceams of its victims."

Which brings me back to the Serbian initiative being proposed here. By all
means, let's have declarations in support of the democratic movement in
Serbia, but I would be uncomfortable with calling on the US government to
intervene in Serbia or elsewhere (again), even if only to threaten or bully
a government into behaving democratically. Why not, when addressing foreign
conflicts, stick to civil society: people to people gestures of support? To
call on Clinton et al to straighten out the mess in Europe is problematic,
to say the least. After all, the American state, in the name of its people,
is responsible for a great deal more oppression, propping up and funding of
dictatorships, military invasions and massacres than any other force in the
world today, not to mention all of history. Perhaps US citizens could do
some thinking against themselves, and propose that their government pay up
its dues to the UN, or support UNESCO's naming Hiroshima as a world
heritage site.... or stop international arms sales by US weapons
manufacturers. Just a thought from the Quebec side of the border.

tom, ok, so you wanna talk turkey, we'll talk turkey...

I

"fuck that, i don't wanna go back THERE"

i didn't come *here* (to paraphrase michael boughn's recent post) as
anything BUT a matter of life & death... now you can take "here" anyway you
want to---use your imagination... but "life & death" to me means---among
other things---how you earn a living... a question, as anybody who knows me
knows, i generally manage to ask folks within my first five minutes of
meeting them (not the best way to make a first impression, but there it
is)...

i came here with all sorts of (doubtless) petit bourgeois ideas intact...
e.g., tv for me is not primarily a matter of simulation a la
baudrillard---first & foremost it's the *place*
'in front of which' my father, brother and i sat and argued, and shouted,
and got along, while my father smoke, drank and worried himself to death...
with a little help from his profession, too---working with furniture
finishes, with the various solvents of his *craft*, had all to do with
carcinogens---which is why i'm suspicious as hell of "craft" as i am of
"institutions"... was my father a "master"---well hell, yeah, sure... i
actually saw an old-timer, a guy who used to teach furniture finishing
during the 30s, literally *weep* at the work my father had done... so
what?---i mean, if you asked *my father* whether he was a "master," he
probably woulda thought you were some kinda NUT...

we didn't have any curtains on our windows, in that upper flat, for the 13
years we lived there (and when i type "windows," i sure as hell HOPE
somebody out there is thinking gui's)... and we left, finally, when they
finally condemned the place... btw, i have an affinity for "they," which i
use, as my folks did, to connote any group that has me by the short
hairs...

now my dad---well, hell, he was a shop steward at general electric in the
50s---high school equiv. after the war, ETC... what do you figure he spent
most of his time talking about?---"intellectual engagement"?... he was a
first generation american born of sicilian immigrants who could barely read
or write... if you catch me using the language of academe, it's b/c i've
had to learn how to use it... so what?... though my mom was a formally
educated woman (which latter was interrupted when the nazis walked into
france), she too spent much of the 50s doing crimp & solder work, piece
work... i assume we all know what this means... and later went on to spend
her final years as a receptionist...

[cut to insert]

the academic in me wants to ask you folks whether any of you have read _in
the age of the smart machine_ (shoshana zuboff), a book that goes a long
way toward unpacking the customary values attributed to different sorts of
knowledges and different sorts of workplaces... and how we're currently in
an age when knowledge is increasingly textualized... it's not w/o its
problems, but hell---tom, when you mention how many of us know how to
_____, i want to say, why yeah, sure, so again, SO WHAT?... that's what
*i* want to say, tom---the "me" that's typing this stuff... i want to say,
hey, i'm not a butcherbakerorcandlestickmaker... i have other things i
*do*, but i don't quite see how my insight into, say, tomato sauce, or into
jogging, or whatever, precludes my discussion hereabouts about academe...

[tape together here]

learning a new language (recall "intellectual engagement," above) was not
all a bad thing... i imagine my vocabulary these days includes quite a few
words and expressions (mixed with fuck and shit and the like) that my
friends from twenty years ago would not immediately grasp (shades of
richard rodriguez here, i know---but please don't mistake my take on my
past for his)... but i didn't learn that new language W/O being suspicious
of this institution... while i would be more than willing to concede that
my folks (note the class-based recourse i have to them, no?) would likely
regard academe and its intellectual set with more outright respect than
perhaps it/they deserve, i would nonetheless assure *anybody* around here
(as should have been painfully clear when i talked about my "doctor of
arts" degree, my non-phd phd) that i'm a far cry more suspicious about
institutions than just about anybody i've met... you wanna see me cranked
up?---just ask me what i think about academic politics... but be sure to do
it *in person*---i'm not half as reasonable-sounding when i have the added
advantage of my MOUTH, present and future, to back me up... and my more
mouthy side wants to take you on, tom, mano-a-mano---that's my contentious
"me," the 50% sicilian in me, the kneejerk jerk in me, the guy who wants to
call *you* out for calling out me on my use of terms, while at the same
time using yourself a word like "animadversions," a word that would
probably never occur to me to use around here, anymore than using archaic
expressions simply b/c they're likely to have more "communicative force"...

but ok...

the point here:  you say you got into this racket easily... i had to work
my nuts off for it... and when i finally got "here," i found mself (as don
byrd so wisely put it, a decade ago) beyond where most of academe would be
able to tolerate... which, ontologically speaking tom, is fine by me... but
i just don't see what i do *for a living*---with its flaws intact---as any
less valuable, intrinsically, than what my bro is currently doing... who,
like me, is a former engineer, but in his case an
engineer-turned-successful entrepreneur... and when i write "successful," i
mean beyond the wildest dreams of my folks...

[cut to insert]

taste, sez michael b., has been for him a "totally frustrating" thread...
why is it that i've found it so valuable, and that you, michael---have
found it so frustrating?... is it the tenor of the discussion itself?... or
is it something else?...

[tape together here]

this list has been invaluable to me in establishing a network sense of
community... heck, i've even used my experiences *here* to help flesh-out
several web publications---not b/c i'm an opportunist (at least, not as i
see it), but b/c i see something important going on in these parts...
primarily, i'm permitted to 'talk' with all sortsa folks i would otherwise
not 'talk' with... tom---you say you're always getting yourself in trouble
in institutions... but hey---you think that i'm NOT?... you think teaching
tech. writing and using, say, johanna drucker's work is not a problem?...
you think i WANT to teach tech. writing?... you wanna know what happened in
april of 1984 when i left the engineering profession (bristol-myers co.),
and it left me?... why do you suppose that your experience with
institutions has been any more problematic than mine... b/c i'm still an
academic?... but hey---i'm 41, for chrissakes, and i'm not so utopian as to
believe i can continue to do this job jig forever... i mean, even though
there's other work for me, if i want it, i've already been elsewhere, like
i say... i don't see why i shouldn't try to stick with this academic
path... and hey, another thing---i'm posting alla this in public WHILE I'M
APPLYING FOR JOBS---some folks on this list are no doubt on search
committees, and have my vita in their hands... so mebbe I'M
SELF-DESTRUCTING again, no?---in even *trying* to be forthcoming... or is
my mentioning this latter reality simply the paranoid in me?... let ME
answer that:  i'm NOT paranoid, but i'm not stupid, either (another
expression from my past)...

[cut to insert]

it occurs to me (and i say this having been a member of this list way back
when it had mebbe two dozen people on it) that one problem here has been
the assumption of community relationships where perhaps there are none...
it occurs to me, though of course i may be wrong, that this somewhat
'explains' michael b's sense of frustration... i don't *know* so many of
you folks, except as you come to these spaces, and in terms of your various
publications... i have a sense, though only a sense, that though tom is
less institutionally-centered (academically speaking) than me, the marker
<tom mandel> means much more for many of you, poetically speaking, than the
marker <joe amato>... so the way i see it, <tom mandel> carries more
institutional weight---in terms poetic... whereas <joe amato> may carry
more, in terms loquacious... perhaps we really oughtta try harder to
introduce ourselves to one another, to open up some of this personal SHIT,
albeit i understand that many of you may not want to hear who all we all
are... still, many e-lists i've been on encourage this sorta thing...

Hmmm.  Wystan seemed to be doing a bit of head-beating himself. And I didn't
see anyone "explain all literature in a single jargon laden paragraph."  I
heard people (including me) question the word "taste," but didn't hear
Wystan (or anyone *not* interested in "explaining literature") venture a
definition of the word in the particular contest in which it was used and
then suggest that there might be other meanings for the word in other
contexts.  As for "jargon-laden," well, I'm wondering what sort of jargon
you might mean, and whether "Academic Master Narrative" might qualify.  Most
of what I've read of this thread has been pretty comprehensible and
apparently straightforward.

What is the difference between "having a poetics" and "explaining
literature"? Seems like "a poetics" *is* an "explanation" of a kind.
Certainly I didn't hear anyone try to explain *away* literature, which is
what you seem to be implying by your comment.  If you've "got" a poetics,
you've also got a story about it, which either does or does not go without
saying.  Even the claim that "having a poetics... is a matter of life and
death" is based on some narrative you've bought into.  It isn't just a
simple "fact."

>And this is a list purportedly dedicated to
>discussions of poetics.

People talk about poetry and poetics in different ways, and there are at
least as many definitions of "poetics" as there are of "taste."  My
exploration of poetics may not cover the same territory as yours, but if you
can't stand it, that's what the "delete" key is for, isn't it?

Joe and I are quite definitely on the same wavelength here. I greatly
appreciate his last, long post written in typical Joe Tomato fashion--hard
hits, some painful honesty, and some artfully placed jump-cuts.  Joe is
talking about class issues--and of course I like that, too.  But then, I
*publish* Joe's poetry, and I like it because it's structurally beautiful
*and* ideologically sound, and it uses a lot of literary conventions which
are often employed to *avoid* talking about matters of substance in order to
better express those matters of substance. (Joe probably likes his own
poetry for reasons which have little or nothing to do with my own.) In
short, he subverts what I've come to think of as the "literary order."  I
don't give a damn if the notion of "ideology" is out of fashion; frankly, I
think anyone without an ideology is either lazy, a fool, or too privileged
to be forced to articulate one. The notion that "art" is somehow beyond or
outside of ideology makes me gag.  There's art in the service of fascism,
and art in the service of freedom, and art in the service of [insert your
favorite cause here].  No art is value-neutral. If I could imitate Dylan
(the recent Nobel *poetry* nominee), I'd say in my best drawl, you gotta
seeerve somebody.

I publish up to six full-length poetry manuscripts a year.  Mostly I publish
poets whose work wouldn't ever get picked up by the more established
literary poetry presses. (Joe is an exception to this rule, and so are
Maggie Jaffe, Leroy Quintana, and Philip K. Jason.)  I publish fine writers,
but they don't play the literary poetry game.  Frankly, I don't give a fuck.
I like their work; I think it's good, so I put it into print.  David
Connolly's _Lost in America_ sold 1700 copies since I published it in
1995... *without* a commercial distribution network.  Dale Ritterbusch's
_Lessons Learned_ just won the Wisconsin Poetry Prize.  Connolly's worked as
a lineman for the phone company for 25 years; Ritterbusch has been paid shit
on a year-to-year contract in the English Dept. of podunk U of
Wisconsin-Whitewater for two decades, where they actually *hassle* him about
the time he spends writing. Unlike many of the folks on this list, I don't
make a dime off poetry, either as a writer *or* an academic.  In fact, my
interest in poetry sometimes costs me thousands of dollars out of pocket in
a bad year--poetry has definitely lowered my material standard of living. So
it's always amusing to me when I'm jumped for my theorizing and my tendency
to "explain literature" at the expense of "art."  My "tastes" are as clear
as day--just look at the Burning Cities Press/VG book list and you can't
miss them.  As a publisher I'm forced to declare my partisan affiliation
with each book I release.  I am hardly a mere theorist.

I hang out "here" on POETICS because what you-all do and talk about
interests me, even though I doubt I'll ever feel a part of whatever
community might exist on this list.  I consider a few of the individuals who
inhabit the place to be friends.  Mostly, I just lurk, though lately I've
been motivated to contribute to the discussion.  I'm always astonished at
how different my world seems to be from the world that most posts on this
list represent.

Poetics List--
  Have received request to indicate which message I was replying to a few
hours ago when citing the New Yorker article on John Wayne. It was Dan
Salmon's of December 2, 9:33 pm:

>Dislike of John Wayne is made rather easy with the benefit hindsight: 'Green
Berets' the fact that he named his son after his 'Indian hating' character
in the searchers & John Ford's confessions that he hid the searchers script
from wayne because he thought wayne would not have coped with its leftist
politics.
His all-round jingoism made him a pretty unpopular figure at a time of
strong anti-war protest & revisionist history. However he is an important
figure for both film & cultural studies - not just as a reflection of his
and his characters politics - but the roles he played in a multitude of
films many of which (green berets - excluded) use his persona to address
complex issues that using a less strong character/personality would not have
adressed.

The love/hate thing ties in quite nicely here, his Ethan was a man who
'hated indians' obviously this is a reflection on him rather than a
reflection on 'the indians' & is a feature by which we judge him - and by
which we know where we stand. It is a locator for his character. (In the
green berets he hates another kind of indian).

Any judgements of Wayne (hate/love - violent (or passive) dislike) have to
be tempered by a certain ambivalence:  the usefulness of his character in
19th & 20th century american attitudes makes it difficult to write-off many
of the films he starred in.

2 threads i see in this discussion:
a) the incursion of capitalisms current de-evaluation of labor, rampant
throughout the rest of the world, getting more apparent in universites; and
b) the connection between teaching and writing.
a tad of background: after a ba and mfa i tried to go into teaching, didnt
succeed, and ten years later tried again (with a second ma).
still i stayed a poet, developed as a poet, though lacked the support and
networking that an academic position can give. i also developed a family and
regional networks that the transient life of a 'beginning' (first 10-15
years?, with certain exceptions) teaching career does not allow.
perhaps the current economic developments (and this ties in with several
past discussions on academic living conditions, including creative vs
'standard' dissertations) are helping to wake up and shake up many writers
to a clearer idea of the role of writer-- the teaching, the creating of more
writers, is at best secondary to the function of sreading vision, spreading
hte power of language, as its expressed in the history of literature, in
language's insight into current human conditions via vernacular and pop
culture, and in the rich psychological well of language itself.
while teaching and the academic milieu has many demands on the body and the
spirit, and non-academic career survival has its own pitfalls (like
isolation from other artists and audiences), maybe these current changes in
economics will serve to bring the power of language to bear more directly on
economic and political realities, to enregize a wider variety of hearts and
environments.

You see, Kali, this is the sort of thing that bugs the shit out of me.
Why would it have to be a "narrative" (and btw this use of "narrative"
and the more colloquial "story" is the kind of jargon he's talking
about) Mike has _bought into_ rather than one he wrote his own goddammn
self?  How long did it take you to write this paragraph?  15 seconds?
Man says he's interested in X not Y, and you shoot back X is Y.  Did you
stop to think?  Don't you think it might have occured to Mike?  So he
had something in mind, which you have given no consideration to at all
in your rush to handle him, make him into a _consumer_ of something you
know all about rather than a _producer_ of something you don't.

That said, thanks for the post and the insight on what you do.  Don't
assume you're the only non-academic here.  Me, I work at the local
Barnes & Noble.

Kali and Pat,

Is having a "story" (or narrative, whichever term you like) really a
necessary forerunner to, or consequence of, having a poetics?

When Mike says that "having a poetics is a matter of life and death," I
take it to mean rather that "a poetics" is a collection of deeply felt
beliefs, ideas, and hunches that shape both initial impulse and
revision--a belief system that is necessary to one's idea of how the
cosmos works. Creating a story out of these beliefs, whether it be a
poetic manifesto or a creation myth, is, I think, a different
act--closely related, to be sure, but still different.

I take the bus all the time here in San Francisco, and I'm always delighted
twice a year when the new poems appear on the bus system.  Usually 6 poems
appear all at once, in different parts of the bus.  I spot one, then I run
to the middle of the bus, then to the back, then back to the right hand
side, murmuring, "Excuse me please" to all other commuters whose feet I'm
stepping on, etc.  In San Francisco these poems appear under the title
"Streetfare Journal" and are edited by the poet George Evans.  Usually he
prints a lot of poems by the Objectivists.  Dunno, maybe they wrote a lot
of short poems.  One time about six years ago I was racing through the 14
Mission and stumbled in my excitement and wound up lying across the laps of
5 of the meanest looking muscle boys in the back row in wool caps huge
radios and glass pipes.  I felt like Marilyn Monroe in "Diamonds are a
Girl's Best Friend," except less, I don't know, elegant.   These boys
started to growl and curse and I was reduced to swallowing hard and
explaining how I just had to see what was new from Miss Lorine Niedecker.
But I am still alive and looking forward to next edition. --Kevin Killian.

just wanted to throw in here, or throw up, or whatever the hell it is i
think i'm doing, that "story" is clearly a problematic way of understanding
poetics... it's not so much that stories as such are a problem, but the
incredible popularity of the term suggests what the problem is:  even in
light of more unconventional stories, and multilinear stories, and such,
recourse to story often ends up reducing a complex of experience to a
"naturalized" datum (news weather sports)... hence the popular experience =
story...  i'm certain kali can better flesh out her sense of how she meant
"story"---it seemed to me she was using the term to connote the necessity
of critical engagement with same... i.e., that our metanarratives often
play a tacit role in shaping our judgment... but if our judgment is not
esp. a function of narrative, or not esp. seen that way, why then perhaps
we do need a better term...

anyway, seems to me part of the problem implicit in this taste thread is as
follows (and i wasn't gonna post this to the list, but what the hell):

i like MACARONI
I like macaroni

the uppercase here to reveal the relative emphasis... now taste inflects
the above two declarations differently depending upon where the emphasis
falls... when i say, i like MACARONI, taste becomes a matter of that
complex kali described so well, wrt macaroni... when i say I like macaroni,
the complex shifts emphasis back over to the i...

now i tend mself to write about stuff using either emphasis... for most
critics i know, i like MACARONI is probably the more typical emphasis...
for many poets, i'll hazard it's I like macaroni (in fact, i think the
poet/scholar tends toward the latter esp.--and here i'm talking, for one,
about mself)... when someone sez, 'I like macaroni so what?,' that someone
is more in the i... when someone sez, 'i like MACARONI b/c it _____" it's
more macaroni that's being emphasized...

only relative, mind you... i think kali has, until her last post, been
emphasizing the MACARONI, and i think pat foley has been emphasizing the I,
esp. in that great long post of his... which is why kali and pat are really
not so opposed---as i see it, anyway...

it should probably all be treated as

I LIKE MACARONI

i mean, both subject I and object ____ are at all times very much at stake
in any such assertion/judgment... but thinking about it this way highlights
a potential problem:

i like macaroni

it's the apparent deemphasis of both sides of the 'equation' that's the
cause, methinks, of some real frustration...

best,

Let me second (third, fourth) what has been said here about the late Paul
Carroll, & especially about his "Young American Poets" anthology.  This was for
me a first window opening on innovative poetry, the first time I'd read Clark
Coolidge, Kathleen Fraser, the 2nd-generation New Yorkers, etc. etc., in short
a whole batch of poets I'd never even heard of before & whom I've stuck with to
this day.  My parents gave me the book on my 17th or 18th birthday, or whatever
-- I have that copy on my shelf today.  It's a mystery to me why, when people
discuss famous "world-changing" anthologies (Donald Allen et al.) Paul Carroll'
s never gets mentioned.  I have to assume that I'm not the only person to whom
it came as a revelation.

seems to me narrative is a structure of language-- you can do what you want
to deny it-- it will be back. the problem is when taste becomes authority.
both kali & pat are taking the position that they are resisting authority--
pat "academic master narratives" -- kali arguing for an understanding of the
social constructedness of much behavior. seems to me both positions can be
right. but i think you have to look at these things contextually-- i.e. look
for authority, see if it can be justified. in matters of taste i can see no
justification. one most times will end up denying the validity of another's
perception. this tends to be boring &/or argument for argument's sake. tho
when one knows another person well something like antin's "tuning" can take
place-- you can get a feel for, begin to see the place(s) that taste comes
from even while not being in agreement. or being in agreement when you're
with that person, you can see it _with_ them, & it might change you. John
Cage had this effect on many many people.

Seattle also adopted a similar poetry-on-the-bus program a few years back.
The city usually does a fairly decent job with public arts projects, but
this particular program has been frustrating because it seems to have been
a one-time effort.  Initially there were a number of buses fully
decked-out with poems (and some artwork) end-to-end.  Today most of the
buses will have at least a few poems up, but its the same poems that were
up in the beginning.  There are a few decent poems among the lot (even
a Russian poem w/ both the cyrillic and eng. translation) but that does
not make up for the horror of seeing "I am the wind! Hear me sing!" among
the ads for three years straight.  Furthermore, there is no indication
given as to how these poems got there, nor where to send new poems to be
put up on future buses.

These are pretty much my own aesthetic grumblings, sure, but there has
been no indication that this program was anything but a one-time shot and
thus I would be inclined to call the program somewhat disingenuous.  It
seems to me that the impetus behind such a program would be to artsify the
masses so to speak--that is, to decompartmentalize poetry from the ivory
tower, black-beretville, or wherever Joe Public might imagine poetry to
be.  If afraid, however, that in creating such a textual space and then
letting it sit static they have created an entirely new compartment, at
least as far as the commuting public is concerned.  And, sheesh, if
Citizen N disliked poetry before, theyre going to dislike it maybe even a
little bit more after seeing the same tired poems over and over again.

So, unless such a program is run on an active basis (such as the
SF buses seem to be) it seems to me that transit-poetry is pretty
useless, maybe even counterproductive.  Seattle's program seems to be so,
at least, and seeing as how it is utterly unregenerative and presented as
little more than a new way to redirect one's on-bus privatized boredom,
the lethargic program rather encourages the notion that poetry is
something one does outside of real life--useless texts, as Gary Roberts
put it.

I didnt know of other such programs in other cities, and am encouraged to
hear that at least some of them are doing well.  If the idea is to get
poetry to the commuting public, perhaps we could take this farther and put
poetry on the outside of the bus as well so that pedestrians and folks in
cars could take part as well.  (Given that such a driving distraction
might cause a few accidents, perhaps Creeley's "drive, he sd, for /
christ's sake, look / out where yr going" would be an initial candidate).
Anyhow, its difficult to be encouraged by bus-poetry when you read tepid
poems inside the KZOK-radio bus or one painted intentionally like an
Adidas shoe.  Here's hoping for improvement.

It's my opinion (and yours could differ) that no one writes meta-narratives
their own damn self. (Sorry you don't like the term "narrative"--or "story"
either, apparently--but I fail to see how they qualify as "jargon." Their
meanings seem pretty clear and accessible to just about anyone who reads and
writes in English.) Gwyn argues that:

>"a poetics" is a collection of deeply felt

I don't think these are different at all; I think that the creation of the
"story" is simultaneous with the assembly of the "collection" and that you
can't have a poetics (or at least a poetics you can express) without also
having a story about it.  In fact, I don't think human critters can make a
move or think a thought that isn't somehow connected to a story they've got
about the way the world works.  Our stories shape our perceptions; they are
what enables us to distinguish between "important" features of a landscape
(any landscape--internal or external) and "insignificant" features.  And our
stories are always formed through our interactions with that stuff which
operates outside us, beyond our control--the environment, other people.
Stories are produced in the exchange between the "I" and the universe.  No
input; no output.  What makes human art so fascinating is the seemingly
endless array of permutations which are possible from similar (but not the
same) input, and the refinement of the various forms this output takes.  I
don't, of course, advocate any sort of simple mechanistic model of cultural
production, since it seems to me that the nuances and complexities and
subtleties of environmental/social/cultural influence on individuals are so
far from being quantifiable that such efforts are laughable.  But it *does*
seem useful to me to try and understand the stories people are capable of,
or willing to tell about themselves and their art, and to analyze those
stories as texts in an attempt to understand what *kinds* of stories might
be useful for what purposes.

>How long did it take you to write this paragraph?  15 seconds?

Nice rhetorical trap.  If I say it took me 15 seconds, then I'm guilty of
being glib and shallow.  But if I say I spent an hour on it, then I stand
accused of having shallow thoughts despite my attention to the paragraph.
Rhetorical devices are swell; I use them myself, particularly when I'm sure
that I've already won an argument and just want to tapdance on my opponent's
head.

Your logic is off.  Man says he's interested in considering W+X (having a
poetics) rather than Y+Z (explaining literature).  I say that that I don't
think anyone was interested in Y+Z (explaining literature), and propose that
we focus on Y (explaining), which I claim is equivalent to S (a narrative or
story). Then I make the argument that if and only if S+X is true (there
exists a narrative of a poetics), then W+X is true (one can have a poetics).
This is a different... ummm, *story* entirely, so the rest of the comments
in your paragraph are not at all relevant to the argument I was actually making.

Well, _de gustibus_ sure has caused a bit of _disputandum_. I'm kind of
ambivalent myself - I tend towards Wystan's view that having _tastes_
(lower case, plural) is vital and human. To say of a piece of jazz (or
opera or rap or pastrami) "oh it's a good example of it's kind" sounds
pale, un-involved, even patronising. But to say "oh that's shite! now X
(insert favourite other example of jazzoperarappastrami) - that's the
real stuff", while risking being thought of as a "violent taste", sounds
passionate and involved. It means that one considers
jazzoperarappastrami worth caring about.

On the other hand (& there's always an other hand...), when _tastes_
solidify into Taste (capitalised, singular), I agree with Kali. _This_
is authoritarianism, or at the versy least arrogance. Interestingly, it
was Lyotard who sniffed "this 'taste' is not Taste" when confronted with
what he saw as the eclectic excesses of some postmodern artists.

It's intriguing that "tasteless" is the antonym of both "tasteful" and
"tasty". In the first sense, a tasteless act is sometimes welcome as a
rebellion against received Taste. In the second tense, it just signifies
blandness.


        Cheers &c,

Kali,

I'll offer a draw on the rhetoric.  As for the logic, you need to change
"if and only if" to "only if" if you want to disagree with me.  It might
take even more sorting out, but who cares?  The point is you think
stories are required for everything, and you have a distressing habit of
using passive verbs and vague pronouns around them, "are formed", "are
produced", "we" simply have them, and they shape "our" perceptions, etc.
Toward the end of your explanations, people do tell them about
themselves and their art, even though at the beginning they're
disqualified from telling metanarratives.  I don't know what to make of
it all.

This is turning into a philosophical argument I can do without at the
moment.  I could critique your use of "story" -- it's something like the
general form of a proposition, and I'm similarly suspicious.  But this
is not a philosophy list, so that's all I have to say about it.

Dear Folks,

 Paul Hoover's away from home and not on the internet for a few more weeks
and I've been away this weekend as the notices about Paul Carroll began to
come in.  Paul and I knew Paul Carroll for about 20 years in Chicago.  The
relationship began when Paul was Paul C's student at the U of I Chicago
and became a very personal one over the years.  In fact, Paul H did the
wedding ceremony when Paul C married his second wife, the sculptor
Maryrose Carroll (with his Universal Life Church mail order ministry
certificate), and there were many nights when Paul C would show up at our
place either in a broadly gracious, poetry-reciting  (he loved Neruda and
knew zillions of poets by heart) mood or in a more troubled state of mind,
often provoked by alcohol.  In his good times, Paul was a great raconteur,
a generous promotor of young writers' work (hjence the anthology) and a
fine poet (some of his work is listy and reminiscent of Corso and the
Beats; other pieces of his are influenced by Catullus and all of the poets
he read at the U of Chicago).  Paul suffered from living in Chicago in
terms of being overlooked for most of his poetic career.  He helped
populareize the Beats and brought Ginsberg to Chicago for an eraly reading
but never was really one of them.  He had many friends among poets but his
being off the beaten track and his recurrent problems with drinking and
depression made him hard to love at times.  Still he was a generous
spirit, a fine poet, and an astute critic.  His reading was broad, his
taste was generous, and no one could tell funny Irish neighborhood stories
like him.

Kali,

(Yipe! Watch where your browser points them thar attributions, okay?)

I think, then, that what you're arguing, while far from mechanistic,
is actually an assertion about human cognition. If you don't mind my
veering off on a tangent, I'd like to ask, quite seriously: do you
think that nonhuman species also use "story" to distinguish threatening
vs. nonthreatening features of a landscape, edible vs. nonedible things,
etc., or do you see "story" as an emergent property peculiar to humans?
(I know, I know, this sounds like "Does a dog have Buddha-nature?")

I do see what you mean about the necessity of a "story" to explain a
poetics; I think that "story," in this instance, can still operate at a
very basic level--in other words, the "story" may have a narrative no
more developed than "This is like A but not like B."

several folks seem to have objections to the notion ov narrative as a
face of one's poetics...  but i rather like th idea (& praps that's me
misunderstanding some "jargon")...  it suggests an ongoing tale, a process
in which we meet new texts, test them against our world view (our poetics)
and either alter that view &/or explain th text in terms of it...  and
that allows for a development across time that has explaination value
for my own experience; also suggests th shared mythology that, fr me,
is th defining feature of a community...  & finally, as this thread itself
points out, that the collection of individs here gathered on the poetics
list have a variety ov such mythologies; hopefully all narrating those
stories together and contradicting th hell out ov one another...

feeling optimistic fr a change

If I were able to spend more of my time reading words spoken/written
with the significance and force of Joe Amato's last post I would be a
happier human on all fronts.

My favorite manufacturer of suits is Oxxford. An Oxxford suit is
stitched by hand -- only the inside seams of the trousers are done on a
machine. The shoulder, as on any quality garment, is set in and
stitched in place by hand. No suit can fit if made otherwise.

Turning up the collar of the jacket of an Oxxford suit will reveal that
the neck has been stitched and shaped by an individual. A few stitches,
then a hand iron and hand shaping, then a few more stitches until the
job is done. The job is done by someone not paid very much money for
his (usually) work.

Look at the waistband of the trousers on an Oxxford suit; the waistband
is stitched together by a individual with a needle between thumb and
index finger. It's a superior way to create a garment.

I might mention that Oxxford suits have no style, that is they are
never in any relation to fashion, tho over the years the lapels have
been wider or narrower as the industry has changed these
specifications.

Naturally, a company making a product of this kind -- anonymous and of
exceptional quality -- finds it hard to survive in the megaconomy of
our time. Oxxford was on the edge, threatening to go under, about a
decade ago. Fortunately, William Haas -- president of, owner of Levi
Strauss -- noticed this. Haas liked wearing Oxxford suits. So he bought
the company.

An Oxxford suit costs about $2,500 off the rack these days. You can
find them at Neiman Marcus I'm told. Just a second, I'm going to count
how many I have in my closet.....

I have seven of them. Now, it goes without saying that I can't afford
to buy them at Neiman Marcus. Instead, I buy them at thrift stores. The
most expensive one I have cost $17. About 3 weeks ago, I found a medium
weight blue cashmere Oxxford blazer in perfect condition in a thrift
store on P street in Georgetown here in DC. Fit like a glove and cost
$12.

Dana, the offer is always open.

Tom

again, i have to chip in here to say that if "story" is used
interchangeably with "narrative" (and there's a significant loss in doing
so) why then i'll second the motion for its ubiquitousness... but i
wouldn't want to argue it at the cognitive level---not w/o a whole lotta
critical interference...

i'm afraid of story... it's everywhere these days, in our media---there
seems to be no damned place you can go where it *isn't*... and i've seen
the results of more simplistic applications of the concept of storytelling
to history... the old grand metanarrative hypothetically gets replaced with
subjective experience, experience that implicitly questions its truth
value---but nature often comes in the back door (or technology, once it's
sufficiently 'naturalized') simply b/c we all tend to believe individual
experience in such terms... and lo---what you get is the standard
metanarrative of progress, say... so it's not always a good thing, in
all... story converts into beginnings middles ends what is a highly (thanx
rod for the backchannel!) contingent, and in my view often highly
complacent, motion toward the "real"...

there are narrative elements in language (as rod suggests), and
metanarrative, as kali argues, is not something *we* purposively make
(necessarily!---the cia is real good at covert such ploys/plots)... but in
order to counter metanarrative, and in addition to some wild stories, i
would argue that you need to attend to that which is not narrative on the
face of it---which may ultimately be per/received as story, which will
surely have narrative elements, but i'll say it again---is not
intrinsically story... you can make a story out of just about anything,
sure, but what is it intervenes and sez, "hey, hi, i'm ONLY a story"?... i
mean, instead of "hey, hi, i'm a TRUE story"... in fact (and kali, you're
more aware of this than most folks i've met), it's exactly on the axis of
truth/fabrication that so much so-named minority/ethnic lit has turned...
if it hasn't been 'normal' enough as a narrative structure, if it hasn't
been 'true' enough as a story, if it's been too postmodern, say, or too
disruptive, why then the 'truth' of it has fallen short of what certain
readers (or critics) have desired... which isn't a criticism of story per
se---i raise this issue to give some idea of the normalizing effects of
story... in short, i prefer to allow both for story and for a more
disjunctive approach to form, which i just won't call story...

but hey---i'm a poet, for chrissakes!... i mean, only some of my work is
really narrative poetry per se---in which the focus IS  narrative... do i
tell stories?... hell yes!... is storytelling my focus as a poet?... hell
no! (at least, not in my opine)... so again, it's a matter of how you
emphasize things...

a long time ago, stein wrote "narrative is what anybody has to say in any
way about anything that can happen has happened will happen in any way"...
true enough... i've always thought that pretty much everything that can
'happen' is part of stein's 'definition'... but recourse to happenings, to
beginnings middles & ends, while it'll probably always be just at our
fingertips, can be just too damned easy...

best,

This is Kevin Killian.  I hope all of you can go to your bookstore and buy
a copy of "Food for Life" ed. Lawrence Schimel (Cleis Press).  This is a
book of recipes by dozens of gay and lesbian etc., writers, poets, artists,
athletes, film stars etc, all with cute pictures of the contributors making
the recipes, and all of the profits go to various AIDS charities--the food
service groups in many cities that go around and deliver meals to those too
ill or weak from AIDS or other catastrophic illness to go out and get it
themselves.  (Alternately, you could just give the money directly to these
groups, which are listed in an appendix to this book.)  They are providing
a great service, and this book is really cute.  Me and my white cat Blanche
appear on page 140 for all of you Poetics List people who have always
wondered, what does Kevin Killian actually look like and what kind of thing
does he eat?  I never thought I'd appear in the same book as Martina or
Ru-Paul.  This has got to be seen to be believed!  Thanks.

This is Kevin Killian.  I missed the very first sentence of the 11th Oppen
lecture at the Poetry Center of San Francisco State, so I missed Peter
Quartermain's announcement of his methodology....  Afterwards I ran around
asking people what he had said.  Apparently he had written to quite a
number of women writers asking them a) if they had ever known Oppen and b)
what they made of his work.  A large number replied and he was able, quite
skillfully, to weave their responses into his talk, which seemed centered
on a few closely related themes.  What were Oppen's own thoughts about the
position of women in the socialist revolution?  What did he make of the new
(1960s/1970s) wave of female poets who followed some of his trails, and why
did he seek so many of them out?  What "news" had they for him, and vice
versa?  A large crowd of interested people listened intently as PQ captured
some of Oppen's ambivalence and contradictory thought on these questions.
Oppen, he told us, advised Denise Levertov to go lightly on writing on
political and social issues, while out of the other side of the mouth he
berated Kathleen Fraser for not delving into them deeply enough.  PQ teased
some sense out of this apparent paradox, but stopped short of actually
coming out and saying Oppen was a misogynist, I wonder why?  Perhaps this
wasn't the time or place.  After the lecture, PQ and Jewelle Gomez, the
formidable director of the Poetry Center, fielded a number of spirited
questions from the audience.  I hope this talk is published in its
entirety, somewhere, sometime soon because I think I have failed to give a
sense of how interesting it was and how multi-dimensional.  All week long
in San Francisco we have been having a whole year's worth of poetry events
so I guess I was wired!  More later....  Sighted at this event was the
novelist Dorothy Allison, who asked afterwards, "Who is that stunning woman
with the copper colored hair over there?  She is my dream girl," and it
turned out to be Kathleen Fraser.

yes, yes, yes, that's *exactly* how i see the process.  i'd add, though,
that we don't meet new texts without expectations created by earlier texts,
by the explanations we've already devised, and by the mythologies we share.
and some shared narratives (for a variety of reasons) become dominant in
particular cultures, and some don't.

funny you should ask this.  the answer is that, yes, i think that nonhuman
species use stories to explain their world.  i live with and train wolves
and wolf-hybrids.  i've been doing it for over fifteen years, and i'm
completely convinced that canines and other social mammals couldn't function
as they do unless they had the capacity to tell stories about the world. i
know it really bothers some people when i claim that animals have quite
sophisticated intelligence and possess some of the abilities we tend to
associate only with human beings (a kind of language; an imagination), but
that's just how i see it. i had one wolf pup--a year or so ago--who had a
terrific imagination.  she'd lay her toys out in the yard and battle over
them, playing tag with imaginary playmates.  her games were quite complex
and had discernable rules.  i've got a pup now who is made tremendously
happy when i am training him.  if i miss a day, he sulks.  when i take him
out to work him he swells with pride every time he does something right.  i
watch the wolves interact with each other and i can see that establishing
social hierarchies and dominance ranking is all about storytelling.
frequently, the alpha wolf (who is as often female as male) is physically
less strong than the rest of the group (particularly as he or she ages).
all the other wolves know that, but dominance is awarded for reasons other
than sheer strength.  establishing the dominance hierarchy is all about
wolves telling other wolves stories.  their stories are different from human
stories, but i wouldn't argue that they are less interesting or less
sophisticated.  it's amazing how many people get really upset when i make
this claim.  i wonder how poets will react...  if you're interested in a
text that describes a lot of my thinking about animals (and how human
stories interact with animal stories) check out philosopher and animal
trainer Vicki Hearne's wonderful book _Adam's Task_.

Been readin along in all this (in between pumping gas) with some mental
pain --

You don't have to be an academic to be aware of the fact that "narrative"
has been a crucial concern in "poetics" for millenia -- And even we
former campus cops can read the difference between a claim that
individuals don't make up metanarratives by their own selves and a claim
that individuals can't "tell" or "write" metanarratives --

If only we could sing "If it weren't for misprision I wouldn't have no
prision at all!"

[and waaayyyy back in second grade (in an early fir of poetics perhaps) I
got in trouble with my teacher for asking how she knew that verbs could
be "weak" -- He seemed to think it a tasteless question]


if the "fir" fits, wear it --

(If you REALLY want to witness a fit of misprision, read J. Rosen's
article in the current _New Republic_, wehrein he not only dismisses
Critical Race Theory's penchant for narrative, but holds these legal
theorists responsible for the movie _Set It Off_ -- )

yknow, i really like the idea of animal narratives, kali!...

the turn to narrative (as in haraway's "core narratives," wrt science, new
historicism, etc.) has been extremely important, sure, it still is... but
is there any way to discuss duration w/o reducing it to episode?...

i'd like to see history more as a matter of assemblage, compilation---which
can of course include stories, but doesn't necessarily reduce to same...
even in terms of community, i often (always) have one foot in, and one
out---b/c of specific idiosyncracies i'm not willing to give up---to
somebody's idea of a coherent 'life' story, say...

anyway, personal stories, dog stories, fish stories---i'm interested in
hearing any and all!...

I forget who asked this (just back from NYC to find 3 Poetics Digests
in my mail, comprising 95 individual messages), but yes Howie Winant is
on the road to a full recovery, though it may take a year or even
longer. He was in a horrific bike accident in the Santa Cruz mountains
last summer and was indeed in a coma for awhile. Also broke and bruised
pretty much everything that can be either broken or bruised. Bob
Perelman's been in much closer touch than I and can give a more
detailed update.

----------------------------

Tom,

There are lots of smart people in colleges, but most often they're
students and relatively unread. One of the problems it raises is the
hierarchical nature of the interchanges, which leads so many teachers
into seeming (or becoming) pompous rather than more knowledgeable.

I tend to agree with Aldon that the computer industry isn't any more
full of smart people than anyplace else (Wall Street, the military,
prisons, etc.). In general, tho, the work relationships between people
are much less tortured than in the academy (here you will find a
differential betwixt those work environments in the last parenthetical
phrase). Outside of prison, sweatshops & the military, the academy is
(one of) the worst work environments invented by mankind.

I, for one, tend to think that tenure is one of the things that makes
it worse. (Treating slavery as privilege is an old trick, but it still
works pretty well.)

OK Joe--I might as well admit--my two cats (poetic black of course) are
my first readers. I swear. Girl Scout's honor. If what is being printed
out on my laser printer is pretty good, one of the cats will immediately
sit on it. If it's REALLY good, they try to dig it out as it's coming out
of the printer. If it still needs work, they won't even be in the room.

Dear Poetics Group:

I have a rather specialized query that only tangentially relates to the
twentieth century, but I'd appreciate any responses.  I am looking for
versification theory about quantitative metrics from the 18th and 19th
centuries.  I'm trying to work up quantitative metrics as a survey
subject and I find myself with lots of material from the Elizabethan
period and, obviously, lots from the twentieth century (Bridges,
Williams, etc. and on into Olson and company), but very little in between.
I am sort of following a thread about quantitative metrics and questions
of nationalism, but that isn't a necessary ingredient.

I understand that Coleridge saw "Khubla Khan" as a quantitatively
metrical poem (In XANaDU did KHUbla KHAN a STATEly PLEAsure DOME deCREE -
I suppose you can hear it in terms of duration rather than accent).  If
anyone knows WHERE Coleridge writes about quantitative metrics I would be
grateful.

Thanks

are you saying taste--rather than a space of division--can be one of
consensus?  rather habermasian dont you think?

Dear Kali,
        I think 'taste' is different from and  more complex than
'opinion' because it presumes a pattern of responses, a pattern that
more effectively supports judgements about works than your 'rigorous
standards of analysis and argument' because it has a broader base, one
which recognizes we  make judgements, discriminations all the time, in
contexts far more varied than your intellectual court of law.

       You and others misunderstand me when you equate' not explaining
yourself' with ' not knowing'; maybe the case for taste is the stronger
for that particular complexity  not being readily grasped.

       We are also at cross-purposes on the matter of the range and
variety of our likes and dislikes, taste is not necessarily narrow.

       I think you have no taste and I don't have an ideology.*


       Best,
          Wystan

  Reconcilable (In)Differences: The Marriage of Writers and Critics

     In honor of the 50th anniversary of the Writing Program at the
University of Denver, the Creative Writing Program, in conjunction with the
Academic Literature Program, is sponsoring a conference to explore the
growing schism between writers and critics.

                                 Mission Statement

     Pressures of professionalization for writers have led to an increase
in the number of degree-granting institutions for poets, essayists,
dramatists, and fiction writers hoping to work in the Academy. As a result,
writers in the Academy are engaging, often for the first time, with
literary and philosophical theoretics sometimes at odds with their own
position as would-be craftspeople. Likewise, professional critics,
theorists, and academics find themselves in the position of being
surrounded in the university setting by individuals who challenge much of
contemporary critical perspective in favor of a return to a craft-oriented
reading of a work. What does all this mean, then, for the writer, the
critical theorists, and the process of hermeneutics
in particular? The re-emergence of the writer/critic and the critic/writer
highlights the late twentieth-century schism that seems to have widened
steadily between the two disciplines. As graduate writers increasingly mix
with graduate theorists, academia must turn its attention back to the roots
of critical inquiry in an effort to reverse, somehow, the resulting
fragmentation of its departments into scattered and often highly
specialized camps. This conference will allow a continuation of recent
attempts to reconcile both halves of contemporary literary
thinking--affording both academics and writers an opportunity to speak to
the future of textual concerns in this thickening climate of professional
and pre-professional integration.

     The current academy, in that it plays host to both critical and
creative endeavors--often originating from the same individual(s)--has
become a hotbed of this type of theoretical debate. Yet as visiting writer
Amitav Ghosh noted recently, "creative writers and literary critics have
never been farther apart than they are today." The purpose of this
conference will be to provide a forum for both critical and "creative"
theoretics. The new millennium promises sweeping changes in the Academy
with concomitant changes in literary theory and practice. What we are
looking for are ideas which engage and further this debate, and which will
illuminate, perhaps, a common ground upon which the problems of textual
studies can be collectively identified and discussed.

Look, Aldon, this particular subthread was started by Mike, who said he
was not interested in "explaining" literature, but that having a
"poetics" (taste, cathexis) was a matter of life & death.  Kali said
your poetics indicates you've bought into some "narrative", allows later
that she was indeed claiming explaining is "equivalent" to having a
"story", and sometimes she says "metanarrative", sometimes "narrative",
sometimes "story".  Don't blame me for the confusion of terminology or
of what exactly is being claimed here.  We've gotten way too far for my
tastes from Mike's original point.  --- Btw, your own post here
indicates a possible circularity (presumably virtuous & hermeneutic for
Kali) in relying on the idea of "narrative" when talking about the field
whose subjects include "narrative".  The talk around here has been about
the narrative of poetics, Aldon, not the poetics of narrative.  Whether
that makes any sense is not my problem.

Comments: To: POETICS list <POETICS@UBVM.cc.buffalo.edu>

Dear Wystan,

Thanks for the interesting observation that taste is more complex than
opinion because it presumes a pattern of responses.  I think that you may be
right about this.  I'm not arguing *against* "taste"--merely against the
notion that it doesn't need to be examined.  I want taste *plus* rigorous
standards of analysis and argument.  Just like we make judgements and
discriminations all the time, we all also have "tastes."  The question is,
"so what?"  I'm interested in the question of what individual and social
functions the possession of particular tastes serves, and if certain
patterns of responses can be mapped to certain belief systems (about race,
gender, or class, etc.).  Seems to me that only a certain class of people is
excused from having to explain or justify their tastes, and that those who
aren't privileged are always having to say why they like what they
like--justify their (outsider) positions to whatever establishment exists.

>       I think you have no taste and I don't have an ideology.*

Hmmmm.  I think I've got taste(s), and you've got an ideology.  Certainly,
I've got very specific tastes in poetry (which is why I publish some poets
and not others), and in music and art.  And I'd wager you've got a set of
relatively coherent beliefs about power structures and politics.  Amusing
that "ideology" is apparently as bad a word for you as "Taste" (with a
capital T) is for me.

Cheers,
Kali

liz: i dont know about coleridge and im not sure i quite understand
whether youre looking for primary or secondary sources here but in the
18th C there is a great deal of writing on metrics.  this is not an area
i am well-versed (ha) in but i would be glad to pass on your request to
the 18th C listserv--or provide the address for you--where im sure someone
would be able to provide you with sources on this subject.  as for the
nationalism aspect: im curious.  could you elaborate?  im actually
working on nationalism and consensus in the 18th C--and ive run across
discussions of parallels between certain political affliations and poetic
forms.  if this is something youre interested in please let me know and
ill pass on the sources for this.  im not sure this is much help.

Liz:

Coleridge also composed hendecasyllabic verse. I'm trying to recall
whether or not they could be construed as quantitative:

"High, and embosomed in congregated laurels," etc.

Obviously, the best work on quantitative metrics is not to be found in
the 18th and 19th centuries but rather in the treatises of Thomas Campion.
Even so, one suspects Tennyson might have written about this, at least
in letters, since he wrote poetry in alcaics (supposedly "impossible in
English," according to Saintsbury). Also: during a break from composing
his heartlessly soporific dactyls, Swinburne attempted quantitative alcaics
in his ode to Milton:

Whose Titan angels, Gabriel, Abdiel...
Rings to the roar of an angel onset

I would also scrutinize the writings of Darley and Beddoes who,
having been obsessed with Elizabethan verse, might have picked
up the Elizabethan obsession with classical meter. All I can recall
of _Death's Jestbook_ were a number of extraordinary lyrics and
irregular odes.

Generally, I would suggest George Saintsbury's _Historical
Manual of English Prosody_, since GS believed that Victorian verse was
the crowning achievement of English poetry. But it might also be wise to
look up "Classical Meters in Modern Languages" in _The Princeton Encyclo-
pedia of Poetics_.

Are you certain you're not thinking of Coleridge's _Christabel_?

Coleridge:

"The meter of _Christabel_ is not, properly speaking, irregular, though it
may seem so from being founded on a new principle, namely in counting, in
each line, the accents, not the syllables."--Coleridge, "Preface to
_Christabel_"

RE "Kubla Khan": I saw some of Coleridge's metrical theory regarding
"Kubla Khan" either in the _Biographia Literaria_, vol. 2, ed. by
Johnathan Shawcross, or in Coleridge's _Notebooks_. I wish I could
tell you more, but it's been a while.

Slightly off the subject:

Here is an attempt on my part to write in feminine alcaics:

When Barber sings Italian, a rougher language
conforms to his cantabile line: the English.
Suspensions lifted from Corelli
Soften its oddity, not its beauty.

And in adonics (This is from a neo-renaissance aria, which I wrote, with
music, for singer John Kelly, in memory of Huck Snyder):

When I am taken,
He will awaken
Never to perish.
Adonis, be cherished:
Seraphim, hold him,
Bright wings, enfold him...

All the best,

Rob Hardin

Dear Steve, I must have been overstating (and skipping).  Of course, as I
said, Quartermain himself never made any such generalization (in his
lecture at the Poetry Center).  Wait till you see his paper for yourself;
in cold print the effect may be very different.  In situ, the total effect
of the testimony of so many different women writers (and of such different
kinds), responding to Oppen, was very forcible, shock wave making.  PQ did
in fact say that Oppen, born in 1909, could not be judged by the standards
of today, or even of the period in question.  I couldn't recall many exact
quotes from Oppen, but I do recall one passage in which he chides Fraser
for dwelling on "feminine" subjects, commanding her to bring her writing
"up into the world," -- such an odd turn of phrase, redolent of the stock
criticism of women's writing--in which what men write about is universal,
and what women write about is fluff.  In this trope ("up into the world"),
sub-terranean fluff like the Orcs.  --Kevin Killian.

J. Timmons--
I don't know if what I sd re taste was Habermassian. I think clearly one can
pick up a taste for something from another person. Again, Antin's "tuning"
concept seems to me a useful description of what happens. I wouldn't want
taste to be too much of a space of consensus-- if everybody liked the same
things life wld be hell.  Because we don't like the same things there's
opportunity for discovery as much as for dissent.

I've recently been in a few cities that have Only corporate restaurants,
Wendy's, McDs, Roy Rogers, they're so different aren't they?-- no local
restaurants left. Talk about leaving a bad taste.

         Date: 05 December 1996 05:20

         We are a group of non-affiliated anarchists out of New York who are
         planning supply trip to Chiapas. We are raising money to purchase a
         vehicle and fill it with supplies that are much needed by the resistance
         in Chiapas.

         The plan is to drive a car full of cargo to Chiapas and donate the
         vehicle and it's contents to the EZLN and it's many supporters to show
         the growing concern of Americans for their struggle. We hope to utilize
         the publicity value of this trip in order to raise awareness of the
         continuing struggle in Mexico.

         We are looking for donations, volunteers, cheap lodgings, supplies, etc.

This is Kevin Killian.  A record crowd showed up on Friday night at Small
Press Traffic in San Francisco.  They had come to hear homegirl Susan
Gevirtz and to give a rousing welcome to Juliana Spahr, making her first
appearance in our city.  Spahr spoke briefly first about her pleasure in
coming to San Francisco then launched into a ferocious, biting rendition of
"Thrashing Seems Crazy" from her new book "Response."  Bob Holman, capture
this woman on tape at once!  Later, she led the audience through a work in
progress tentatively called "Lie," which combines quotations from Gertrude
Stein, standard psychological evaluation forms, question after question,
interrupted anecdote, faith and charity.  The crowd went wild.  It took
another fifteen minutes to calm everyone down, then Gevirtz took the stage
and read from "Without Event," the "essay" which leads off "A Poetics of
Criticism."  A few minutes later we heard the complete version of her
long-in-the-works "Black Box Cutaway," a work meant to be read with the
accompaniment of slides.  Knowing the technical limitations of Small Press
Traffic's tiny staff, canny Gevirtz brought her own machines and staff to
set this up.  All worked splendidly.  The readers seemed ideally paired for
once, with a mutual interest in, for example, false memory, for "Thrashing
Seems Crazy" is based, Spahr told us, on an episode of Oprah Winfrey which
presented a woman convinced she is being stalked by her own male alter ego,
a part of her own personality cut off, therefore made real, by a splitting
of the mind; while in "Black Box Cutaway" Gevirtz uses the materials from
"Remembering Satan," the controversial case from the Pacific Northwest in
which a man confessed, under the most rudimentary of interrogations, to
molesting his family for the glory of Satan, apparently without recourse to
actual event.  Am I remembering this reading correctly, or did it all
happen in my dream?  Were others of you there, too?

then writing is strictly a head job? language certainly has a
material/physical dimension, and stroffolino's post touches on this.
jeff hansen's essay in latest pb ("raggedness as poetic sensibility")
might be interesting to look at here: how heads and tails figure into
language (and departure points, examples: artaud, notley, cortez, vallejo,
et al.)

Re Coleridge and meters quantitative and otherwise:

The best place to begin all inquiries metrical is _English Versification,
1570-1980: A Reference Guide with a Global Appendix_ by T.V.F. Brogan
(also of Princeton Encyclopedia fame), JHU Press, 1981. This is a massive
(700 page), well-annotated bibliography of writing on versification by
poets and critics from, well, 1570-1980. It would no doubt be useful for
the larger project as well as your local inquiry.

On the very specific question of Coleridgian metrics and nationalism see
Jerome Christensen's essay "Ecce Homo: Biographical Acknowledgement, the
End of the French Revolution, and the Romantic Reinvention of English
Verse" in _Contesting the Subject: Essays in the Postmodern Theory and
Practice of Biography and Biographical Criticism_  ed. William Epstein
(Purdue UP).

Hope this is helpful.

Accused of Circularity --

This is not quite the tautology implied -- It is not particularly
circular to rely upon the idea of poetics when dicussing poetics, or to
rely upon the idea of narrative when discussing narrative -- WWhat I
responded to was not simply an insistence that narrative is not included
in discussions of poetics, but was in fact a sharper wedge drawn between
them -- I'm perfectly aware of the difference between discussing the
narrative of poetics and the poetics of narrative, and it appears to me
reading back over our archive that both subjects were discussed -- In
varied ways, Kali insisted that one who has a poetics is involved in a
narrative -- That narrative in its turn would itself be susceptible to an
analysis of its poetics -- No?

It would be circular (in the bad, logician's sense) to begin with a
definition of narrative presupposed which then reappeares as the
conclusion of the investigation --  I took Kali to be saying that any of
us who make aesthetic judgements do in fact operate upon the basis of
some form of poetics and that such a poetics places us within a
narratable set of presuppositions -- Kali might go farther (I'll wait to
hear from her on this) and argue that those presuppositions are not only
"narratable" (in the sense of already relating to one another in
discernable sequences in time) but already form a narrative --


To me, having grown up with ears open, it did not seem earth-shattering
news when novelists, poets and scholars started talking about "narrative"
knowledge -- I've never worked through all the epistemology of this, but
I have yet to encounter any act of language that could truly be defined
as "plotless" -- Though I think I have a general idea of what people mean
when they describe some novel I enjoy as plotless --  (I do not, let me
hasten to add, hold "narrative" and "plot" to be synonyms.)

A poetics does not exist in a timeless space -- It relates in varied ways
to earlier statements and events -- It certainly can be seen as an event
in a narrative without causing too much ontological pain to anybody --

There is even a story of how my poetics got to be that way -- I can tell
it -- I think this is true of most people --

I can't see anywhere that Kali said poetics and narrative are synonymous
(though I may have missed it in those algebraic equations that suddenly
erupted a few posts ago) --

It was hardly the case that the statement didn't make sense -- but I've
been condescended to before -- If something here doesn't make sense, it
may very well be my problem -- and I'd be happy to try it again --

before I truple damn myself -- let me add that I don't see it
particularly circular to rely upon the idea of narrative while discussing
something (poetics) that includes narrative -- I rely upon the idea of
Colorado while discussing the United States (BAD analogy -- but here I
am) -- The novel includes narrative -- I can have a narrative about the
poetics of the novel -- in fact, I just read one last week --

I was going to wait until the CD was actually in hand to mention it here,
but since there's some interest in Pauline Oliveros now, let me mention
that Suspended Music, the first CD for my label, goes to press in, I hope,
less than a week.

It's a collaboration between Pauline Oliveros' Deep Listening Band (with
Stu Dempster & David Gamper) & Ellen Fullman's Long String Instrument.  It
includes two long recent compositions, Epigraphs in a Time of AIDS by
Oliveros and TexasTravelTextures by Fullman.  I don't want to get into any
convoluted discussion of matters of taste here, but, of course, I think the
music is great.

When the disc is back from the plant, I'll be offering it to list members
for less than it'll sell for in stores.

Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII

EMERGENCY APPEAL

PRD LEADERS AND ACTIVISTS, MOCHTAR PAKPAHAN TRIALS TO START.

On December 12 the Soeharto dictatorship will begin the trials of leaders
and activists of the Peoples Democratic Party (PRD) and its affiliated mass
organisations as well as against Mochtar Pakpahan, head of the Indonesian
Prosperous Labour Union. The primary, secondary, and sub-secondary charges
against them are all "subversion" which carries a maximum penalty of death.

Among the PRD leaders charged are Budiman Sujatmiko, President of the PRD
and Petrus Haryanto, PRD Secretary-General. Charges have also been filed
against ms Dita Sari, President of the Indonesian Centre for Labour
Struggles (PPBI) and Ignatius Pranowo, PPBI Secretary General. Also charged
is Wilson, coordinator of the Indonesian People in Solidarity with the
Maubere People and a member of the PRD Executiv and Astika Anom, head of the
PRD education department. Garda Sembiring, head of one of the largest
branches of Students in Solidarity with Democracy in Indonesia (SMID) is
also among those charged.

The arrests of the PRD leaders and activists were originally defended by the
dictatorship by accusing the PRD of being behind rioting that occurred on
July 27, following an attack by government military and police on the
offices of the opposition Indonesian Democratic Party. Lawyers for the PRD
prisoners now say the indictments hardly mention the July 27 riots at all
but concentrate on attacking the political documents of the PRD and its
programme of protest actions during 1995.

The dictatorship has singled out the PRD for total supression and has issued
orders for detention of all PRD personnel.

The subversion charges were filed two weeks after Indonesia's Supreme Court
reimposed a four-year jail term on one other of the accused, namely, Muchtar
Pakpahan. Pakpahan was jailed in 1994 on charges of inciting mass labour
unrest after riots broke out when soldiers attacked a workers demonstration
in the Sumatran city of Medan. He was freed last December after the Supreme
Court found that there was insufficient evidence for his conviction.
Pakpahan had been arrested again in August following the July riots in
Jakarta.

On November 28 Indonesian judges released all 124 Indonesian Democratic
Party (PDI) supporters of Megawati Sukarnoputri who spent four months in
jail on lesser charges of refusing to obey orders by the security forces to
disperse.

URGENT APPEAL

ASIET calls on all supporters of democracy and human rights to protest the
filing of these subversion charges against the PRD leaders and activists as
well as Mochtar Pakpahan. We urge you to send letters to the Indonesian
Embassy in your country and to your foreign ministers calling on them to
raise the matter publicly with the Indonesian government.

We urge all groups and individuals to follow ASIET reports over the coming
weeks. Further protest activities will be necessary.

We also urge all supporters to help the defence campaign by making a
donation. Donations will be sent to Jakarta for the PRD defence campaign and
to produce publicity materials. Please send cheques or money orders to the
address below.

Charles (or any other interested parties)

Oliveros's "I of IV" was first heard by me on the recording _New Sounds
in Electronic Music_ (odyssey no date on record jacket/sleeve, but
probably around '67) -- This collection also includes Reich's now famous
"Come Out" and Richard Maxfield's "Night Music" --

I first heard all this stuff as a kid who plucked such albums out of the
cheap music bins (and they WERE cheap even when new -- but that was a day
in whcih records such as this were sold at the equivalent of Walmart [I
got mine at E.J. Korvettes]}

Have not looked to see if there's been a CD reissue, but I'm sure you can
find this music still in the catalogue --

"I of IV" dates to the time Oliveros became Director of the Tape Music
Center at Mills -- It was created in July '66 at the University of
Toronto Electronic Music Studio -- uses sine tone genrators, tape and
Hammond reverb -- lasts about twenty minutes --

Ron -- I didn't say or at least didn't mean to say that people in the
computer industry are smarter than those in the academy. Only that the
academy, which might be imagined as a gathering of specially high
intelligences, is not particularly: and this I wanted to say not to
critique the academy but only as a kind of encouragement to those
(students) who might fear falling from the academy into a dumber world
of commerce or whatever.

By the way, I have had a number of backchannel communications from
people who want advice on how/where to locate Oxxford suits. I find
this very cheering, and I would like to help (those who are not my size
and live in a different town). But, I'm not sure I can. It may be a
gift, like unto the ability to rhyme.

PREMONITIONS: An Anthology of New Asian North American Poetry
Edited by Walter K. Lew

Published in November 1995 by Kaya Production.
Paperback and Clothbound editions: 6 x 9 in., 595 pp., 36 b&w plates.

The most comprehensive anthology of Asian North American poetry to date,
PREMONITIONS gathers work ranging from cyberpunk meditations and Buddhist
odes to video and multimedia texts, L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E-influenced writing and
neo-Orientalist recuperations and juxtaposes them in ways that both echo and
subvert categories of theme, poetics, and identity.  Pidgin poetry, queer
writing, multi-lingual texts and Canadian open-field compositions further
broaden the scope of this ground-breaking collection. The 73 contributors
include veteran authors like Jessica Hagedorn, Lawson Fusao Inada, Trinh T.
Minh-ha, Fred Wah, Kimiko Hahn, and John Yau, as well as such "premonitory"
new poets as R. Zamora Linmark, Barry Masuda, Evelyn Lau, Amitava Kumar, and
an emerging generation of poetry-expanding multimedia artists like Gloria
Park. Also featured are previously unpublished poems by the late Frances
Chung, Roy Kiyooka, and Theresa Hak Kyung Cha.

PRAISE FOR PREMONITIONS:
"An exquisite artifact of activist experimentalism, theoretically smart and
so beautiful it hurts, Premonitions promises to be a landmark in American
letters for many years to come."
-Maria Damon, University of Minnesota

"An impressive collection distinguished by its variety and sweep. By turns
entertaining, exciting, troubling, it is always provocative. A  major
contribution."
-David Palumbo-Liu, Stanford University

"Demonstrating the infinite range of possibilities overlooked by the too
easily applied label of 'multicultural'...this collection steeps the reader
in alternative histories and approaches to language and tells stories
seldom-if ever-heard. Recommended for most poetry collections."
-Fred Muratori, in LIBRARY JOURNAL

"When you turn this smokin' tome aloose, you may not be able to get the
poetic license plate number, but you will definitely know it was felony
hit-and-run."
-Wanda Coleman, Author of HAND DANCE

        Yes! & I think it was the hymnodist Isaac Watts (forgive my memory,
hard to think at work) who also wrote Sapphics: I have heard it suggested
that both Cowper and Watts might be said to have used this form because the
strain upon their language that it caused was similar to the difficulty of
getting into an appropriate language the quality of God's mercy they wanted
to express.  The long and short of it (bad pun) was: by using Sapphics there
were able to control their words in a methodical manner similar to that
strict application will over passions that Methodism entailed.
        A question this brings up: are quantitative metrics (you could apply
it to all metrics, but it would get messy) generally understood (by writers)
as a form or as a method? For Cowper I think part of the attraction of the
form was the method necessary to make it work.

I'm barging in on topics long-since hashed out, etc.)

Hi,

Can anyone tell me anything about the "Art and Language" group that was
around in the 70s and 80s in England? Do they still exist as such? What
might they have to do with the rock band Red Krayola? I know this is far
from any recent thread, but I figured someone out here could help.
Backchannel if desired.

Kevin--The paper does sound fascinating, and I hope I get to see it one
of these days.  I've never made a real study of the subject, but my own
sense from working with the Oppen papers at UCSD, and w/ Rachel's fine
edition of the letters, is that George's relations with women were quite
interesting and complex.  And btw, I'm sure Rachel herself wld have much to
say on the subject.  Undoubtedly, he was subject to some of the gender
prejudices of his day, but I also remember some remarkable cross-gender
insights as well.  There's one passage in the papers, i think, where he's
quite conscious of his masculine self as a kind of fragile "phallus" being
protected by the women in his life.  Which brings us to Mary.  There are,
as I recall, some remarkable documents at UCSD from her own feminist
"awakening" in the sixties and seventies.  Some odd stuff too.  If I
remember correctly, in the manuscript notebook of Meaning A Life the
script was pasted over with recipes.  steve

Thursday night was the Eleventh Annual George Oppen Memorial Lecture
sponsored by the Poetry Center at San Francisco State.  This year's lecturer
was Peter Quartermain.  I wasn't informed of this event and thus did not
attend.  Damn.

Friday at New College, upwards of a hundred people packed the Cultural
Center to see Juliana Spahr and Susan Gevirtz.  Juliana, whose triumphant
FIRST reading in San Francisco this was, read FIRST, introduced by intrepid
Dodie Bellamy.  She started with "Thrashing Seems Crazy", a piece based on
an Oprah episode, and "Live", based on the apparently rollicking Ichor
Gallery series of yore.  Many people noted the rapid delivery of the East
Coast poet.  Catchy lines included:

"leave molotov cocktail in own yard"
"a woman calls her stalker 'the poet'"
"when a fish is hooked, other fish don't see the hook" (title line follows)
"I am lost in the center called nothing
and this makes my relation to the periphery troubling"
"it is more common to not want to do this thing"
"turn some man or woman head
turn head some thought"
"men can count, and they do"
"is it communication or manslaughter?"
"it is a threat wrapped in a caress"
"is that a term from Stein?"

There was a break to allow everyone to get in touch.  Tactiles that night
included Jay Schwartz, Lauren Hudath, Pam Lu, Avery E.D. Burns, Lyn
Hejinian, Jean Day, Mary Burger, Rodrigo Toscano, Hung Tu, Margie Sloan,
Peter Gizzi, Liz Willis, Stephen Ratcliffe, Spencer Selby, Travis Ortiz,
Steve Dickison, Tina Rotenberg, Michael Palmer, Colleen Lookingbill,
Kathleen Fraser, Pat Reed, Bob Hale, Shauna Hannibal, Aaron Shurin, Laura
Moriarty, Giovanni Singleton, Renee Gladman, Kevin Killian, Dorian
Harding-Morick, Myung Mi Kim (who showed up after a long battle to find a
parking space, only to have Juliana finish her portion of the event), and
Stephanie Baker.

Susan Gevirtz continued with excerpts from "Without Event--The Reign [or
Rain--I'm not clear which] of Commotion", which included lines like the
following:

"he is present at his own absence" [from Beckett]
"how the film frame is a window of tempo"
"Dear Possible:"
[someone's stomach near me is gurgling.]
"forget the possibility of future experience"
"the perils of the fixed idea"
"all the stories were at war with each other"
"animal bites littered the sky.  Immigration"

Then Susan read from _Black Box Cutaway_, a work inspired by the collision
of some Lumiere Brothers films with a lecture on brain neurophysiology.
Susan projected slides on the wall behind her while she read.  There were
windows opening onto impossible landscapes, cutout shapes and pantyhose.
lines included:

"carve her cunt into the sky"
"all around me reports of/the/sky"
"dictatorship of the present"
"he thought 'sewing machine'"
"the soccer ball never appears, only trousers running on white"
"police stations will melt into the population"
"the giving of gifts is a display of writing"
"is an airplane a flying border?"
"death isn't dead--it's a movement, again"
"if we've lost Cronkite, then we've lost the whole country" [LBJ on media
reaction to the Tet Offensive]

There was a party at Susan's, and after much frustration parking, many
people arrived to eat animal cookies, grapes, crackers and cheese, and to
drink wine and water.  I got to look out the windows which appeared in the
slides.  The landscapes I saw through them were possible, but just barely.
There were New York tales exchanged for California ones (of both the San
Francisco and San Diego variety) as Juliana, Rodrigo, Robert Hale, and I
talked.  This is how I know of the Eye-Corps Gallery fiasco and how everyone
thinks Rodrigo only goes to male poets' readings, when the opposite is true.
There are copies of _Antenym_ 11 bandied about.

Saturday there's a party at Leslie's house, but I was not in attendance so I
can't say what went on there.

Sunday at Canessa Park Gallery several of the people from Friday and several
others come to see Meredith Quartermain (who's married to Peter Quartermain
of the Vancouver Quartermains, who in turn is married to her) and David Bromige.

Avery intros Meredith, who reads from her Meow book _Terms of Sale_, from a
work in progress called _The Resurrection of Sherstin Constantine_,  and
from her erasures of the _Philosophical Investigations_, which she calls
"Wittera" and which were instigated by Norma Cole.  Meredith also sometimes
writes by taking 2 words at random from a box she's filled with words and
building poems around them.  Lines included:

"legumed in coconut"
"in the hold you guard her fire building zinc fields of wrens"
"don't buy linted pistachios at the bakery"
"as cannot will when will not may"
"words, it seems, idea"
"and this not why knows used"
"wander ice tracking lunatics tracking air"
"thought drift/clouds cemented"
"sentence funnel/Tertiary house/the of ship"
"Europe webs away geography"
"so I can't talk at dinner when it's supposed to be your birthday"
"he raven me jane"
"you see, cretin, a Grecian vase/ode on a crusted barnacle"
"beware of telephone gunk"
"the feuding balcony of his stomach protruding between t-shirt and belt"

The lights at Canessa Park are blinking their approval.  After her reading
Meredith announces she's retiring the word "vomit" (which she used four
separate times in her reading) from her box of words.  It was fun while it
lasted.

David Bromige reads from _Dream Book_, which stems from a workshop he
participated in at the Quartermains'.  The Dream Book integrates dream
material with interpretation and the sustained use of latinate roots to
intriguing and comic effect:

"as she steps forward, her kinesiology intervenes"
"she brings her face close to mine and says, 'Gladys'."
"There was a buoyancy among us all--revenues were up."
"I was a candidate for candidate"
"I was licked.  It was in a tongue I didn't know."
"He says, 'Laughter is betting.'"
"'Come on, Dad, grow up, we're late.'"
"people like strolling dicta"
"It's like my system's jammed, and I blurt out the one word, 'Cleave!'"
"your Kierkegaard is nothing to my welfare"

David then reads a poem in 5 parts called "T as in 'Tethered'".  One of the
parts goes like this:

T as in "tethered."
E as in "tethered."
T as in "tethered."
H as in "tethered."
E as in "tethered."
R as in "tethered."

We all (including Kathleen Fraser, Kevin Killian, Dodie Bellamy, Norma Cole,
Bob Grenier, Stephen Ratcliffe, Susan Gevirtz, Doug Powell, Cole Swenson,
Margie Sloan, Etel Adnan, Margaret Butterfield, Dale Going, Steve Tills, and
Patricia whose last name I didn't get) give forth thundering applause for
both poets, and reconvene at Kathleen Fraser's house for spiced apple cider,
more wine, delicious cornbread, bean soup, brownies and cookies.  On her
balcony you can peep through her neighbors' windows as they make dinner and
lie on their beds watching TV; David says it's like the 50's.  Meredith and
I swap books and methods of stealing other people's works and manipulating
them.  Some of us talk about how weird our families think we are; when Norma
finds out I have two younger sisters she says, "I always wished I had an
older brother."  I have tremendous affection for Norma Cole and am tempted
to say, "Heck, I'll be your older brother, Norma," but I don't actually know
her THAT well and I'm not quite sure how to say it so it doesn't sound
salacious.  In another room, 12 of Bob Grenier's 4-color beach scrawl poems
that Pavement Saw's publishing are spread on the floor and we all try to
decipher the words.  I'm impressed when Kathleen gets "Aeolian."  More
copies of _Antenym_ 11 are bartered, sold, and made gifts.  Jack and Adelle
Foley give me a ride down to the BART station.  Their car's crowded because
of me; I almost get to sit on Joyce Jenkins' lap but we find another way to
fit four people in the back seat (darn).  Jack and I trade banter all the
way there; samples probably better off lost in the mists of memory.

Subject:      Irony Query
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII

This is more a request for suggestions than an actual question.  I'm
researching a paper on irony in lyric poetry, and I'm trying to chase down
examples of verbal irony in lyric poetry.  By verbal irony, let me just
say that I mean this in the loosest sense of saying one thing and meaning
another (e.g. saying it's a nice day for a picnic when there's a blizzard
going on outside).  The aforementioned example is a little extreme, but it
illustrates my point in everyday conversation.  I realize that there are a
million sub-species of irony irony in literature and in everyday speech,
but I'm not really looking for situational irony (e.g. a poem that points
us to a situation as if to say, "isn't it ironic that...?").

If any of you out there can think of examples off the top of your heads
where verbal irony might seem to obviously be a powerful feature of the
poem, or indeed the controlling feature (Nemerov springs to mind as a poet
who might be thought of as deploying verbal irony frequently) of the poem,
please let me know about them (off-list is fine, so as not to clog up
people's mailboxes).  I'm really looking for English or American
anthologized poems that could be easily found in one of the Nortons
(sorry, I don't mean to open the whole canonicity can of worms, and I
apologize in advance for being picky).  Thanks for any and all
suggestions.  -Erich

Re: "accused of circularity".

First: I didn't say the circularity is there.  Second: I didn't say it
was vicious rather than virtuous.  If everyone around here is going to
insist on playing at logic, believe me I'm prepared to do that, I'd just
rather be doing something else.

Let me pose a question: Kali says having a poetics indicates you've
bought into some narrative; suppose I argue that she holds this view
because _she_ has bought into some narrative; could she say, proving her
point, "Yes!  Exactly!"?  No.  This narrative talk explicitly does not
take into account the truth or falsehood of the narratives in question.
In fact it's probably meant to go with some subjectivizing treatment of
truth and reality, a sort of epistemological Rashomon.  I'm not arguing
against that, I'm only pointing out that we're not considering whether a
given narrative is true.  So Kali might hold her position because she
has bought into a _false_ narrative about poetics & narratives.  The
fact that she has done so, if she has, shows nothing whatsoever about
whether she's right.  She might be right for the wrong reasons; she
might be wrong in a self-supporting, question-begging, unfalsifiable
way; she might be right and her views a poetics she holds, as she says,
because of the narrative she has bought into.

Circularity, vicious or virtuous, is not the same as tautology.  A
tautology, under one neo-Leibnizian model-theoretic definition, is a
proposition that is true in all possible worlds.

How much more of this do we have to go through?  There is description
and there is explanation.  The latter will be narrative, in some sense,
and involve notions of causality.  To describe someone's mental state is
different from giving its etiology.  To describe a tree is different
from saying how it got to be that way.  These descriptions can probably
always be taken up into narratives, and mere sequence glued together as
cause and effect.  But it is not required, and it is obvious that people
sometimes resist doing just this.  One reason they do so, is to avoid
forcing the description in a particular direction because of ideas they
already have about the causal chain.  A physician can miss certain
symptoms, and hence make a misdiagnosis, if he thinks he already knows
what's wrong with the patient.  _Of course_ he could tell a story about
the patient's symptoms: he could tell the wrong story.  It proves
nothing.  On the other hand, a hunch about the cause gives you a way of
forming falsifiable hypotheses, in the form of effects to seek out.  "If
the killer left through the garden, he should have left some trace of
his passing, footprints, blood, etc."  You must rely on some law as the
major premise here: killers who pass through gardens leave traces.  When
you find no traces, you can either conclude that the major premise is
false (sometimes killers leave leaving no trace) or, if you are very
confident in the major premise, then you conclude the minor premise if
false (the killer did not pass through the garden).  Making up a story
can help you find what you want to describe as part of the real story.
It can make you find things that aren't really there.  Evidence always
underdetermines the theory it supports; there's always more than one
theory to fit the facts.  You choose for other reasons, allowing some
premises to be wildly underdetermined (the universe is regular and
predictable in its workings), but standing as fixed in order to evaluate
your hypotheses.

Shall we continue in this fashion, here on the poetics list?  I vote,
nay.  If y'all continue to prod me about this, I will continue to
respond -- probably.  I may just get too bored.  We're talking
philosophy now, and we shouldn't be, and whose fault is that?  Not
Wystan's.  Not Mike's.  Not mine.  We didn't make these grand claims
about the nature of things.  I've posted some longish rambles that have
few claims at all and nothing much like a conclusion, but they had a lot
of stuff in them I'm interested in.  I have now been drawn into arguing
about things I'd rather not argue about, but still I am making very few
claims.  You don't see me saying that people do or don't have stories
that shape their perceptions and their poetics.  All I've done is object
to the sweeping nature of some of the claims put forward here, and my
point all along has been to go in fear of generalities and get down to
cases.  The problem with big theories is never that they don't work, but
that they work all too easily.  As Hegel said of the unmediated
absolute: "It is the night in which all cows are black."

Now can we get back to poetics?!  Pound makes a lot of points for
Chaucer against Shakespeare -- now how about that?  Is it just what
Eliot says was his blind spot when it comes to drama?  EP's procedure is
not quite to say Chaucer is "better" than Shaks, he judges each thing
according to  its perfections.  (He makes some points for Douglas's
metric against Chaucer's.)  He seems to feel that Chaucer's thought was
superior to Shakespeare's, and even notes that his culture was "wider"
than Dante's.  He sees Chaucer as a European and Shakespeare as an
Englishman.  This is all very "narrative" you might say.  You might then
ask whether this narrative is true, or you might just consider the
decriptions themselves for accuracy.  And the point is to get to the
stage of deciding what it means to you, and whether in the particular
case it adds up to some judgment or not.  Pound is careful: "Can you be
interested in the work of a man who is blind to 80 percent of the
spectrum? to 30 percent of the spectrum?  Here the answer is, curiously
enough, yes IF . . . if his perceptions are hypernormal in any part of
the spectrum he can be of very great use as a writer --- though perhaps
of not very great 'weight'."  That is not said in the Chaucer/Shaks
context, but would seem to go along with what he says there.  Etc. etc.

Comments: To: Kali.Tal@YALE.EDU

Dear Kali,
        Well, all right, you do have taste(s) and I have an ideology.
On second thoughts  shouldn't that be:  ideology has me?  Rest assured I
have values. I have political views, too. And it has occurred to me that
you equate both with having an ideology. Is that so?  You see I don't
think I do. You say, the notion that art is somehow beyond or outside of
ideology makes you throw up, so a lot hinges on what you take ideology
to be. For another way to pose this question of taste is to ask: what is
the relation of ideology to poetics. Is there a poetics of ideology?

        I was interested in your thought that groups without privilege
were required to justify their tastes and those with it did not--that's
what I meant when I spoke of judgement supported by class. And its a
context in which NOT EXPLAINING is political. There's the story about
jazz, which involves Duke Ellington as a rule, and a white middle class
woman as a rule asking what is the meaning of 'swing', and getting the
answer that if you have to ask you'll never know, or something like. So
that requirement to explain can be refused. The 'interrogation' can't
start unless you know the right questions. Maybe class is always
involved one way or another. I'm not sure.  Taste in my book would
always be 'acquired taste', which is to say there's always knowledge
there gained from wherever it is concentrated, 'on the street', or in
the library,  and the refusal to explain is a way of insisting on the
importance of knowing. Taste statements draw lines (I HATE
SPEECH--Robert Grenier) which surprise those who don't know enough.

        I write a lot of art criticism. I am aware that my tastes as a
critic differ from those of the artists I write about in ways that
reflect our different activities. Generally speaking mine are broader.
As a critic I am drawn  towards your position, postponing value
judgements, accepting this work may be good of its kind, explaining the
work, translating it into the language of ( even the poetics of,
discourse of, ideology of) the audience for the work, standing in the
middle. It is the same with the teacher.  As a poet, however, my focus
is sharper and different (although my tastes can be as eclectic as
hell), I'm not a bystander, my governing interest in other people's work
is in its relation to my own activity as a poet, to my poetics, my path.
It is worth arguing that there's something wrong with this being in two
minds. And that criticism is as answerable to poetics as poetry is, and
answerable to it before it is to other kinds of discourse such as
literary criticism or  cultural studies.

This thread wouldn't attract much of my attention IF NOT for one fact: some
of the

in other fields for a few years and then come to the academy expecting it to
be a utopia in which the men are witty, the women are feminist, and all the

are above average.I stick around because teaching strikes me as one way of
fulfilling
the buddhist (w/ marxian inflections) call to pursue "right livelihood,"

than it is when I'm grading papers and making syllabi for a living. But
what to make of
the folks who think the academy is the place to escape corporate domination?
On the one hand, their hearts are in the right places (and how I wish they were
correct in their assumptions). But I don't know about the brians of these folks:
Maybe I need a new cliche: the old one about the corporate world being dog
eat dog
while in the academy, it's the other way around, just doesn't seem to be cutting
it.

I've never teased out of a thread, but here's a good irony for us all --

that would be getting philosophical, and we shouldn't do that here --

The Duke Ellington story (are there any witnesses?) involves a stranger
pressing for an explanation -- which the pressee refuses --

Seems to me a different order of exchange from a refusal to explain an
opinion that has been publically opined --

Someone may come up to me and ask, "what does Pat mean when he says that
your remarks may be circular" -- I may reply, "I refuse to explain"

Another thing entirely for me to say, "Donne can't lick Milton's shoes"
and refuse to explain myself --

Pound being careful around 1935 -- "Muss. is having a war. All right.  We
got Louisians [sic] and a war in Africa is better than one in Europe
which ALL the buggaring gun makes [sic] wanted."--

Well, I'll be leaving town and this borrowed keyboard in a few days to go
read stuff at Moorland-Spingarn, so my bumbling around in the regions of
sense will subside, if bumbling can be said to subside --

I just haven't the taste for it

and DAMN this suit Tom sold me itches -- but it sure looks good on me

Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

A five day absence on a wonderful trip to San Francisco gives me some
160-odd (some of them distinctly odd) messages to get through.
A quick note on my Oppen lecture: I did not argue -- and did not wish to
imply -- that Oppen was a misogynist. I'm certainly not going to inflict on
you 55 minutes-worth of talk on you here -- around 30 pages of double-spaced
typescript which I hope and guess might one of these years get published --
but I think I'd better say something. In my talk I tried to open up possible
answers to two interrelated questions:
1. Why in the 60s did Oppen notice, pay attention to, (some) young women
writers at a time when very few other men (except a few gay poets) were
doing so?
2. What sort of news did he have, for those for whom he had news? (There
were and still are quite a few such.)
[I don't, incidentally, think he got much news from *them*, but to say so
thus baldly is probably to malign him. It's complicated.]
I wrote to a number of women writers asking them to talk about their
relations with Oppen, hoped to build my paper around their replies (I got
about a dozen replies), and found that I simply had to deal in some detail
with Oppen's deeply ambiguous attitude towards women, his sense that they
are an alien species, his bafflement. A strong feminist, also a patriarch. A
really interesting mix.
And yes, he did chide Kathleen Fraser for dwelling on feminine subjects, as
Kevin says, in almost the same breath praising Diane Wakoski for her pursuit
of same. And attacking Levertov's political poetry too. It's all
fascinating, actually (and a HUGE topic), and has to be pursued. Whether I
do so myself or not is another matter, since I've rather a lot on my plate
right now. I'd sure like to.

As soon as I can get all the permissions sorted out, I'll try to publish
this paper, and will let everyone know where to find it.

Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

I was going to say I've always thought this, but no, not always. It just
feels like that.

It's seemed to me for a long time that quantitative verse (I absolutely do
NOT mean verse modelled specifically on Greek and Latin metres, but
durational rather than accentual verse) was almost completely out of fashion
from around say 1620 (give or take 20 years) until about 1920 (give or take
ditto). From Donne, if you like, to Hopkins (both have really interesting
quantitative measures -- e.g. Donne's first holy sonnet), and Swinburne has
some wonderful and complex effects, as in "Itylus" [in _Poems_and_Ballads_
1866]. Spenser's correspondence with Harvey is a wonderful discussion of
quantity -- Spenser closing (at least I think it's in the last letter) the
series of letters  with a quantitative sonnet which Basil Bunting thought
was the most perfect piece of quantitative writing in the language. The
difficulty of course is that (to put it crudely) in English, stress
lengthens the syllable, and most verse is a mix of accentual/quantitative.
Some ears simply don't hear the quantity, since they're not used to it --
and anthologies like the Norton and pretty well all others, by modernising
the spelling, breed tin ears in all of us.. If you start thinking in terms
of consonant clusters and juncture, though, then Whitman for example
suddenly begins at times to be quantitative -- the opening lines of "Out of
the Cradle" for instance -- I discuss this in _Disjunctive_Poetics_  -- and
so do passages of Wordsworth. I've NEVER been able to read Tennyson, so
cannot say whether he does it or not. Basil Bunting is a great quantitative
writer. So too Creeley, Zukofsky. In this century, a long ling list. But
discussions of it in the 18th and 19th centuries? I doubt there's any, save
among prosodists who think quantity is Greek or Latin ONLY, and must
therefore be in Sapphics etc etc when moved to English.
So there may be a terminological problem in older discussions.

And -- an aside -- there's a great discussion of stress and its relation to
pitch and syllable-length in English poet Douglas Oliver's 1989 book
_Poetry_And_Narrative_in_Performance_.

she walked in with Adelle Foley, I ran up to Eileen and told her how much I

had lots of practice assuaging her fans.  I helped her re-pin up the poster
she knocked off Kathleen's hallway wall and then she fluttered into the
kitchen like a moth, like a lovely turquoise moth.  Meanly, Kevin
attributed her high spirits to the arrest and incarceration of Janice Blue,
one of her rivals for Bob Kaufman's affections.

This is off the top of my head - but as far as I ever knew the Art &
Language thing came out of the Coventry School of Art & Design (now
part of the University of Coventry) in the early 70's - or at least
one very important thread did. A few years ago a lecturer from the
above place had an exhibition at Warwick's Mead Gallery and he was
certainly still working in that tradition. I don't know whether he is
still there or not, and I can't discover his name as our catalogue
is down at present, but unless much fuller info has already come from
somewhere else I will try and find out.

Dave Zauhar supports my point only -- only! I say -- because he hopes
I'll tell him where to find the suits :-)

Reading his post I remembered a day about a decade ago when I was
installing a network in a law office in San Francisco. I was connecting
one digital lego to another having seen through their protective
coloring to the obvious (to the person who designed it and no one else)
connection between these two outposts of bit, when the legal secretary
standing near me, a wry man evidently gay and evidently amused at my
mutterings and ejaculations, asked "Have you ever read Harry Mathews?"
I'd never been asked about Harry's work in a business context before,
so I stood straight up and wrenched my back.

I think about Gerald (his name: we became friends and went to many a
Giants game together) too, because he's dead. Rich, the attorney he
worked for, he's dead too.

I started writing about Oxxford suits in response to Ron Silliman's
post about the bloodbath that is our time.

Perhaps, too, we can turn George Oppen into a human relations problem
and suggest that he "can't be judged by the standards of our time." Why
should a discussion forum putatively comprising thoughtful folks
repeatedly express itself in such conventional self-praise as to
imagine this a time of greater understanding than some other on any
ethical subject whatever. By the standards of our time Lucifer looks
like a big donor.

I knew George and Mary Oppen pretty well over about 3 years in the late
seventies. We went out to dinner often with my then wife Gaelyn Godwin.
George was mostly gone intellectually; mostly he would repeat a small
repertoire of stories and thoughts, though he was able to be responsive
if you reached him with a question, and he was physically just fine and
still doing some writing too.

It's hard to park in SF, and we often found ourselves walking several
blocks from the car to dinner. George liked very much to walk with
Gaelyn, and I would walk with Mary willingly as she was a radiantly
beautiful and alluringly cogent womanl. Gaelyn told me that George
would begin by conversing with her but would soon fall silent and begin
to hum to their rhythm, their pace. In her description it seemed an
experience both peaceful and sensual.

But that was a long time ago.

Getting to be nearly forty years since I first saw Paul Carroll in some
poetry context or other that I tiptoe-teenaged myself into. I remember
his florid smiling face and that it must have been summer, as he was
wearing a straw hat -- the stiff-brimmed style that men used to don as
soon as Memorial Day passed back in the days when nearly every man you
saw on the street wore a hat, and the difference between a hat and a
cap was a class difference -- and a seersucker suit from Brooks
Brothers.

(I know I'm getting myself into trouble with all this stuff about
clothes)

I'm trying to remember whether Paul was involved in the flap around the
Chicago Review in 1958 ('59?) which led to the creation of Big Table
magazine and a legendary benefit reading in a Folk Music club on the
near north side where Corso read "Made in Italy" and Allen G. read his
incredible Chitchen Itza poem (name escapes me). I was a little
highschool mole at that event, sitting in a world that seemed the only
one I'd ever want to inhabit and as near and far as could be.

This was a young Paul Carroll and the impression he gave was jaunty in
the extreme, both bohemian and bon vivant. A figure.

-- New issue of _William Carlos Review_ is a special number on Williams
and Surrealism -- lots of good stuff -- Marjorie Perloff reviews Parker
Tyler reprint at end of journal --

Paul Carroll was indeed involved in varied flaps mentioned -- I've read a
letter he sent to Baraka asking advice at time of _Big Table_ legal
trouble, as Baraka/Di Prima had been through similar problems with
_Floating Bear_ (including night in the pokey for issue containing
excerpts from _Naked Lunch_ and _Dante's Hell_)

More male poets in early sixties interested in the works of women than we
might think (though not always for purest of reasons) -- Baraka edited
_Four Young Lady Poets_, or whatever that annoying title was --

But, the males certainly did dominate publishing & reading scenes -- For
a project I'm working on, I've been trying to locate black women who were
working in avant garde poetry scene from WWII through 1970 or so --
Helpful folk here on the list have put me in touch with Gloria Tropp --
If anybody else knows of some little known work -- please let me hear
about it --

--I wrenched my back READING Harry Matthews, but I bought season tickets
to the Odradek Stadium and have been enjoying the season greatly --

Erich,

I've always been impressed by Berryman's uses of irony in the _Dream
Songs_. Many of them are colored by humorous irony, and others by a
melancholy irony. For instance, the bitter "ha"s at the end of "Dream Song
384," which is one of the most moving elegies I know of. I'll keep
thinking about it. The topic is interesting to me as well. I often notice
that contemporary poets use irony to undercut what it seems they really
want to say, which, given the workshop aesthetic's tenet against taking
too strong ("preachy" is often the word used) of a stand in a poem, is
not surprising. Does anyone else think that irony may be a bit overused
these days? I'll try to think of some specific examples.

Yes, it was Paul Carroll involvedin the flap about censorship (and
Burroughs, I believe) that led to him forming Big Table Books and
magazine, which went 5 issues.  His straw hat stayed but after his divorce
from first wife, summer gear became tee-shirts and shorts and a 10-speed
bicycle that he used to ride in Lincoln Park until he got inspired to
write a poem.  One more Paul Carroll anecdote:  needing $$ after his
divorce, he began driving a cab at night (in addition to being a
professor), and on the day Neruda died, he threw a party of businessmen
out of his cab for not knowing who Neruda was.

Molimo da prosledite sledeci poziv intelektualcima sveta.


                        VOICE YOUR SUPPORT TO THE PEOPLE OF SERBIA

        Appeal of Democratic coalition ZAJEDNO (Together) to the world
humanists and intellectuals


Belgrade, December 9, 1996.

        Dear Sir/Madam,
        We are writing to you in hope that you will voice your support
for our
efforts.

        As you have probably seen or read in the news, for the past 20
days,
the people in Serbia have been holding peaceful demonstrations against
the regime of the infamous Slobodan Milosevic.  The protests started
when he and his government, unsatisfied with the fact that they lost the
local elections in all major cities, simply annulled the election
results.  This means that they simply canceled the democratically
expressed will of over 2/3 of this country's population which voted for
our coalition ZAJEDNO ("TOGETHER").  In addition to that, there is a
total embargo on the freedom of information and no freedom of the media.

        When the citizens of Serbia realized that their voice means
nothing
when expressed through legal institutions, they took to the streets in
peaceful demonstrations for their basic human rights.  More and more
people are joining in the demonstrations every day and they are drawing
the attention and support of the entire democratic international
community.

        At the same time, the Milosevic government is showing no sign of
giving
up in its attempt to yet again take this country on the road to
disaster.  Again, he arrogantly refuses to listen to reason.  Instead,
through the media which are completely under his control, he constantly
keeps on spreading lies about the protests and denying the people of
this country simple information, thus worsening the situation daily.  He
must be stopped before this situation reaches the boiling point with
unforeseen consequences.

        Many international analysts have already compared these events
to those
in Prague in 1989, when the people of Czechoslovakia succeeded in
peacefully bringing democracy to their country.  However, there are also
those who foresee Bucharest as our future.  We do not want violence and
bloodshed and we do not want Bucharest.

        Our only goal is to succeed, by peaceful means, in getting what
rightfully belongs to us -- democracy.

        On the other hand, Slobodan Milosevic seems intent to cause
bloodshed
and destruction just so that he can maintain his power.  This is what he
has been doing for the past five years, stopping at nothing and
sacrificing thousands and thousands of lives for that purpose.  To stop
him, we need the support of all democratic governments and
institutions.  We need the support of all of you who believe that
dictators and dictatorships should not exist in Europe at the end of the
20th century -- all of you who believe that laws exist to be obeyed and
that those who break them must answer for their actions.

        This is why, on the behalf of hundreds of thousands of people
who are
demonstrating in the streets of Belgrade, Nis, Novi Sad, Kraljevo, and
other cities of Serbia (the numbers are growing every day!), we ask you
to voice your support for our efforts.

                                Respectfully yours,

                                                the ZAJEDNO coalition,
Serbia

No poetry after Auschwitz?

In a letter to Karl Jaspers, Hannah Arendt referred to Adorno as "one =

of the most repulsive human beings I know." =


There would be many reasons to hold this opinion, and anyone familiar =

with the relations between Walter Benjamin and Adorno from the time in =

the late 30=92s when Adorno got to America to B=92s death would be able t=
o =

arrive at it independently, observing in the correspondence for example =

a genius of Benjamin=92s magnitude forced to grovel for a few pennies =

before a toad like Adorno, forced to hear and treat as significant =

Adorno=92s trivial and pettifogging critiques of his work.

This is not why Arendt detested Adorno, however, although she was =

certainly familiar with the relations between the two men (Benjamin and =

Arendt were friends). =


No, Arendt detested Adorno for his attempt to ingratiate himself with =

the Nazis when they first came to power, his attempt to use the fact =

that he was half Jewish - not a real Jew (I should say not!) - to slide =

onto the slip-thru side of the newly-empowered National Socialists. =

Even moreso, Arendt hated him for his as she called it "indescribably =

pathetic" attempt to excuse himself when his activities were discovered =

thirty years later.

(I should say, btw, that although I am familiar with the =

Adorno/Benjamin correspondence and with some of Adorno=92s own writings, =

none of which I have ever liked, all of which seemed monumentally =

self-aggrandizing, the affair I am about to narrate I know only =

second-hand. I rely entirely on a written report in a pair of footnotes =

to the Arendt/Jaspers correspondence. Fans of Adorno=92s work, especially=
 =

those who feel they=92d like to complete their acquaintance with his =

texts, will surely want to read in their original positions the =

documents referred to below.)

(I should say further that I was a student of Hannah Arendt's for most =

of my grad-student career.)

In a periodical called Die Musik in June 1934 Theodor =

Wiesengrund-Adorno wrote a music review in which he praised a song =

cycle written to poems by Baldur von Schirach - an obscure person today =

thankfully but extremely well-known at the time as a Nazi poet and an =

adorer of Hitler, to whom the book of poetry was dedicated (to "Adolph =

Hitler, the Fuhrer")! from which come the texts of the songs. The song =

cycle bears the same name as the book. The editors of the =

Arendt-Jaspers correspondence describe it as containing "phrases which =

even today can be regarded only as obsequious gestures to =

the Nazis. Adorno apparently was not bothered by the fact that some of =

the poems advocated mass murder." The review also uses a phrase of =

Goebbels - approvingly.

It goes without saying that Adorno took no opportunity after the war to =

mention having written this document, that it played no part in any of =

the judgments he made of German intellectuals=92 relations to the Nazis, =

and that he did not footnote his Minima Moralia axiom about poetry =

after Auschwitz with any reference to the poetry he had praised only a =

few years before Auschwitz was built.

The January 1964 issue of Diskus, a Frankfurt student newspaper, =

contains an open letter to Adorno, written by a student and asking =

whether he was the author of the review in question. Adorno replies in =

the same issue: "I deeply regret having written that review," says he =

(and I don't doubt it!), especially because "it deals with poems by =

Schirach" and made use of "a phrase of Goebbels." =


I find it hard to credit this "regret" that did not lead to =

repudiation; Adorno had kept his authorship of these words secret for =

thirty years.

After expressing regret, according to the editors, he goes on to make a =

series of excuses and concludes that it will be left to the reader "to =

decide whether those incriminating sentences should be given any weight =

in assessing my work and my life.... No one... could possibly compare =

me to Heidegger...."

In discussing what had so angered Arendt, the editors to refer to =

"Adorno=92s tactic of insincerity: choosing to ingratiate himself with =

the Nazis in parenthetical phrases and then asserting in full sentences =

that his words had not been meant that way; and pointing to someone =

guiltier to make himself look better. Throughout the letter he uses a =

logic of evasion that makes it an =91indescribably pathetic=92 document =

indeed."

Hard as it is to tell where one patch of mud ends and the next begins, =

I can=92t say I feel much difference between the writer of the =9234 revi=
ew =

and the =9264 letter, but like Adorno, I leave it to the reader to =

decide.

It is instructive to compare the situation of Adorno and that of Paul =

deMan who was vilified for his collaborationist writings in Belgium. =

I=92m not a fan of Paul deMan and would not wish to explain his =

situation, far less to explain away his actions, but it is useful to =

note the differences in the two situations. For one thing deMan was in =

a country under military occupation which he was unable to leave. =


One could go on comparing the two. Certainly it would be interesting to =

trace the pressures in their respective works of these episodes in =

their past. Interesting to someone who has no other flowers to arrange.

I=92ve known about this episode for a few years but haven=92t had the hea=
rt =

to expose it to others. Only being once again confronted with praise =

for this disreputable creep, and knowing I would be again, has made me =

sigh and set down what I=92ve read.

Interestingly, the German students to whom Adorno replied in the =9160s =

seem to have been more or less satisfied with his reply. Perhaps it was =

enough to see him (indeed, to see a Jew) painted in their own merde. =

Perhaps his evasions spoke to theirs. That was the sixties; these are =

the nineties. That was Germany; this is a different place. It will be =

instructive to see whether/how any of you respond, indeed whether there =

is any reaction outside this small circle. If so, it will be up to =

someone else to take the matter any further.

To all regarding the Big Table issue:

Actually, Irving Rosenthal, then editor of the Chicago Review, founded Big Table with
Paul Carroll after his Winter '58 issue was suppressed. A newspaper columnist had read
the first appearence of Naked Lunch in the Autumn '58 issue and wrote an article on the
front page of the Saturday Chicago Daily News called "FILTHY MAGAZINE ON MIDWAY."
(Rosenthal was instrumental in collating and editing the Naked Lunch manuscript
Burroughs had sent him; while Burroughs was in England, Rosenthal and Ginsberg formed
the manuscript that Burroughs was ultimately to revise once more (in three weeks) and
give to Olympia). Chancellor Kimpton of U. of C. suppressed the issue and Rosenthal
refused to put out an "innocuous" issue as the faculty and administration asked.
Rosenthal then tried to decide what to do with the material he had collected--some of it
was offered to Ginsberg who was editing an anthology for City Lights. The idea to form
Big Table was a collaborative one: Paul Carroll, who had been involved with the Chicago
Review while a graduate student, helped acquire funds to start a literary mag. The
material for the suppressed Winter '58 CR issue became Big Table 1. Included were
Burroughs, Edward Dahlberg and Jack Kerouac and the issue was edited and introduced by
Rosenthal. The later Big Tables also used material Rosenthal had collected: works by
Kenneth Koch, John Ashbery, Alan Ansen, Robert Creeley, John Wieners, etc. The Chicago
Review continued under the direction of a student who was willing to put out a few
innocuous issues for the school's sake; the remaining staff left with Rosenthal.

Rosenthal went on to write one of the greatest beat novels, Sheeper, in the 60s. Gilbert
Sorrentino edited Sheeper while at Grove and Grove published the novel in 1967. Sheeper
remains Rosenthal's only novel. Anyway, this might clarify som of these details.

The whole piece was fascinating, & I for one thank you for it. But maybe
that's because I haven't read much Adorno, although I found parts of
_Minima Moralia_ interesting (I was sent to that by a quote in a Jed Rasula
piece). On the other hand, I have always found those remarks on jazz (&
other aspects of popular culture) so stupid (must be my 'taste'), I could
not be sure there would be much of anything I could trust in his work.
Benjamin, what I've read, on the other hand, is always brilliant, even when
I don't agree.

At any rate, that's a striking tale (a narration of a poetics, to boot?)

1) it was a monkey wrench

2) many years ago, _Odradek_ was in a trilogy volume from, I believe it
was, Random House -- Now long out of print -- The volume was remaindered
everywhere and for months I snapped up copies (at 1.00 a piece) and gave
them to people -- That volume was, in fact, my intro. to Matthews -- who
I have treasured ever since -- Keep hoping Dalkey Archive or somebody

A very hasty (because pressed for time) response to Tom Mandel's post
(perhaps just to get the ball rolling...)--

Thanks for the reference to the review in Die Musik.  I would be very
interested to hear what anyone who knows the Adorno bibliography better
than I do has to say about this.

Treating the attack not simply as ad hominem (which it was), a couple of
quick points:

--Arendt's record on denunciation is far from spotless--witness her
silence vis-a-vis Heidegger's silence.

--Adorno's response to Benjamin's Baudelaire piece (letter of 10 Nov.1938)
might well be described as bullying (and may indeed have had a very
serious effect on Benjamin's work on the Arcades project and his relation
to the Institute), but his objections are far from trivial.  They raise
very important questions about the relationship between Benjamin's
critical procedure and his Marxism.  See, for starters, the brief piece
(called 'The Frog and the Prince', I think) in Giorgio Agamben's _Infancy
and History_.

--Yes, Benjamin was "a genius of [whatever] magnitude" and Adorno, in his
later work, is deeply indebted to him (and acknowledges it: see the essay
on WB in _Prisms_ and sundry comments in _Aesthetic Theory_; and indeed,
the famous remark that got this thread going should surely be read in the
context of WB's great thesis about culture and barbarism in 'Theses on the
Philosophy of History').

--Likening Adorno to Paul de Man seems hazardous indeed, not least because
the burden of Adorno's work from _Dialectic of Enlightenment_ on (and
earlier too, I dare say) was the most sustained and serious attempt to
grapple with the implications of the Nazi (and Stalinist) era. (to dismiss
all this as 'self-aggrandizing' is simply a refusal to read--which is not
to say that Adorno is not also often a pain in the neck to read)

And let me toss out this question (probably rhetorical):  doesn't
the gesture of removing Adorno from the constellation in which Benjamin's
work was written (and should surely be read) constitute a refusal to face
the political questions Benjamin raises?


Well, that's my scuffle with the gauntlet Tom Mandel threw down ... who's
next?

I've noticed that with all this recent discussion of poets who work in the
academy analyzing the academy, and poets who work in the computer field
analyzing the academy, that these same poets haven't been discussing the
computer industry.

So--Tom, Ron (Bill Luoma maybe too, right?), a question for you. While in
many instances I agree with your critique of the academy (I know a slave
when I am one), there's seems to be in your posts the suggestion that your
own choices regarding economic matters and survival have been better ones.
So, tell us about the computer industry. You're not slaves there, I take
it? Or at least not slaves to the same degree? I'd be curious to know how
your own industry affects your creative life. Why is that choice working
for you, if it is? We're NOT talking about the difference between slaves
and slave owners, right? Is opportunity there, where you are? For whom?

Please excuse the inability of this modem to "correct" "errors."

I'm responding to Jeremy Green's post which he cc'd to me back o' the
channel.

To take a few particulars first. I didn't liken Adorno to de Man or
even liken the two situations to each other. I said I thought it was
"instructive to compare" the situations of the two men. The difference
between their works is an entirely other matter, and one is entitled to
whatever opinion/position one wishes on either body of writing as a
whole.

Likening Arendt's silence on Heidegger to Adorno's behavior, on the
other hand, really won't do. For one thing, it's irrelevant to Adorno's
behavior; for another, it's not altogether accurate (tho certainly
partly so), as anyone reading Arendt's correspondence will understand.
I had several conversations with Arendt about Heidegger, by the way,
and honesty compels me to say that she did not face the issues very
clearly in her relations with me (let it be said that I was a lowly
grad student and she may not have felt I'd be able to keep up my side
of the discourse, yet.... In any case, her spotlessness is not an
issue. Unless Jeremy can find in her history a hint of collaboration at
any level whatever. Don't think so.

I don't think either that one can or I did "remove Adorno from the
constellation in which Benjamin's work was written...." That would
require extra-historical powers beyond my possession during this
lifetime, maybe next time around. I don't think as highly of Adorno as
Jeremy seems to; I don't think highly of him at all.

In case you hadn't guessed. Which brings me to the most important point
I want to make. Yes, as Jeremy remarks, my post on Theodor
Wiesengrund-Adorno and his attempt to ingratiate himself with the Nazis
by praising Baldur von Shirach's fascist poetry, and his smarmy attempt
30 years later to excuse himself was an ad hominem attack.

It was so for two reasons. These are my beliefs; that's the first
reason. And since I received tenure long ago and on another planet I am
unmotivated to suppress my beliefs.

That's obvious. Second reason is the more important one. I am not an
"expert" on Adorno; it's not my profession. I am not an "expert" on the
Holocaust, though I have a substantial connection historically with
that phenomenon. And, I am not an expert either on the history of
Nazism and the endlessly variable relations to it of individuals alive
during its sway. I don't, either, want to be drawn into a debate on the
subject or related subjects or on Adorno's work. I don't have anything
useful to say about it. It seemed best to me to foreground the
revulsion his behavior causes in me, as this is the only authentic
relation I have to the subject. It is not a relation that requires any
corrective.

A post which presented facts and references and combined them with my
personal point of view seemed the mostly likely tactic to get the
material out while getting me out of the picture.

December 25 will be the anniversary of the death of Emmanuel Levinas
should we wish to mention the name of a philosopher in the context of
these exchanges.

That's not possible. If you didnt see the classics and duds that prededed
the spaghettis, then you didnt see the spaghettis, because they were
contingent on one's being familiar with the genre.


By the way, I was talking with Charles Watts today, mentionmed that in the
oater thread no one m,entioned, as I recall, "Ride the High Country," which
is usually mentioned by oater fans really soon. Besides having old Randolph

Even though this thread is about to fade and manu are departing or going on
vacation, the broad concepts here of story/narrative/poetics with the
injection of animals does raise some problems I think.  From an
evolutionary/adaptive perspective an animal's (including human qua animal)
story/prism is a way of quickly and nonconsciously taking a reading for
possible threat and to make meaning of what might or might not have
meaning.  Premature closure (in a Gestalt sense)can easily lead to
problematic errors in cognition (e.g. self-attribution of blame for
inexplicable disaaster or trauma).  This is quite a distance from my
hope for a poetics?

Adorno's "jazz" commentary a good example for our recent discussion,

Dear George:

Duh-rat you for tempting me away from line-inputting corrections in my
FC2 tome just before its deadline. You, McBowering, are a muskrat swallower
and a Blunt-EE Racer, and yes,  I do mean that as a challenge. Choose your
weapons, O'Pard: Earmuff-toss to the death, or noisemakers at dawn.

Apparently, George, light-o'-my-list, you're not as strong believer in what
we yankees refer to as deferred memory. I and many other smarmy-brats who
were born in the 60's (and, presumably, the 70's and 80's) saw the trilogy
before we caught anything by John Ford. For people in their thirties on down,
that Argento/Bertolucci-scripted meta-deal might well have been the
first cathartic film we *didn't* experience. But enough about me.

Let me get this straight:

>That's not possible. If you didnt see the classics and duds that prededed
>the spaghettis, then you didnt see the spaghettis, because they were
>contingent on one's being familiar with the genre.

Oh. Oh I see. A few of us thought we had seen the trilogy, but now we
learn that, because we hadn't seen "the classics," we didn't really see
(or is that "see," George?) Clint's films at all.

Here's your ring back, George. You really are a heartless gunslinger.
And let me tell you, Buster: the june wedding's off.

So tell me, George: if some of us had seen *a few* classic westerns first,
could we at least be said to have *partially seen* the Leone trilogy? And
while we're on the subject: if a little girl watches _Clueless_ before
reading Jane Austen, has she actually seen _Clueless_, or will she be
forced to watch that cutesy-wootsy film again in college? If one reads
Hart Crane before the metaphysicals, will one be compelled to reread
_The Bridge_, lest the Crane experience be wiped from the mind?

Ah, well. Perhaps I had a bit too much opaline back there in the
saloon with Sheriff Francis McThompson. But let me say this:

When it comes to westerns, I can appreciate your insistence on a
well-rounded education, George. But this "you didnt see the spaghettis"
argument is making me feel like some guy in one of those 50's time-travel-
what-if scenarios, in which Joe Foont travels back to the stone age,
inadvertently steps on a butterfly, and returns to the present to
find a trained earwig elected president. (Come to think of it, the earwig
part is absolutely true.) So if you'll lend me your Duke Hondo Time-
Twister Glasses, perhaps I'll be better able to concede your point.

Tom,

Good point -- though I'm not quite sure which way you're slanting it, on
account of that question mark at the end.  This is what I was getting at
with my doctor story -- missing symptoms because you already "know"
what's wrong -- and the more general point that sometimes people resist
for very good reasons the tendency to create narrative out of
experience, those reasons often having to do with accurate cognition.
The description/explanation split I referred to, and which I get mainly
from Wittgenstein's emphasis on same.  (The example of Foucault, from my
misspent youth, probably also influences my view of this, the way he
used to say that confinement just "happened" and that his work was a
description of that "event", without offering anything like an
explanation.)

Funny thing of course that the example I've made up I present as a story
with causal relations: the doctor made the misdiagnosis because he
didn't perceive certain symptoms because he had a preconceived idea of
the patient's illness.  What can we deduce from my mode of presentation
(or Wystan's noting that my long post had lots of stories in it, as this
one does)?  I don't know.  I seem to have some distrust of narrative,
some, maybe less than I have trust in it but _some_ -- now do I have
that distrust because of some narrative I've bought into? a narrative
like this one about the doctor? or like yours, Tom?

Here's another story.  Interesting episode of "Frontline" something over
a year ago I think in which they took on the question of the effects
television violence.  Some material there already for a discussion of
narrative, but what really interested me was the "dangerous world"
theory some professor offered, that because of the dynamics of tv news,
the coverage of crime, etc., many people come to believe the world is a
more dangerous place than it really is.  And my corollaries to this
theory were that, believing this, people stay home, abandoning public
space to the criminals, and thus in fact making the world more
dangerous.  It seemed to me there may have been a loss of the sort of
street life you see in movies from the fifties and earlier, when good &
bad shared the public space.

This has to do with paranoia.  Funny thing -- this ties in with your
story here -- a friend of mine, Mark Faller, suggested that evolution
might actually reward paranoia, a hypersensitivity to threats, etc., and
that we may be one of the species in which this occured.  Food for
thought.

It would be interesting to consider narrative and causality and the
ascription of motives.  (I can't resist quoting this, Phil Dick said
paranoia is not when you think your boss is out to get you -- he
probably is anyway -- it's when you think your boss's _phone_ is out to
get you.)  The problem of "other minds".  The pathetic fallacy.  All
these things tie together.  Aw hell I'm starting to sound nietzschean
after all these years again, because in the back of my mind I want to
say that belief in causality derives from an ascription of motive or
purpose to objects, the universe, whatever -- and that's a lot of crap.

Looping back -- on that other poetry list a while back, there was
mention of Forster's distinction (in that little book on the novel)
between story (and then ... and then ...), mere sequence, and plot.  The
boy died and then his mother died -- story.  The boy died and then his
mother died of grief -- plot.  Descriptions in sequence are narrative,
but not yet explanation, story but not yet plot.  Maybe.  And a
scientist or a doctor or a poet can try to stop at mere sequence as an
attempt at more reliable (or something) cognition.  (Another tangent?!
Frank O'Hara's "I do this, I do that" poems.)

I'd like to do better than this.  Your post raises key questions, Tom,
about making meaning of what may or may not have meaning.  I used to try
to imagine what it was like to live in the Middle Ages, when everything
might carry some meaning, when everything could be a sign requiring
interpretation.  We seem to live with meaning scarcity as people other
times and other places have lived with a meaning glut.  You have to
wonder about language, the brute physicality of signs, bearers for us
sometimes of meaning.  What a shift from believing language itself is
natural because God gave it to us, and believing it natural because it
evolved.  An emergence of meaning out of meaninglessness, where before
there was nothing outside the universe of meaning, the physical universe
itself a sort of language.  The sort of cognition I've been commending,
the scrupulous scientist resisting premature closure, that's a drive
toward meaninglessness, or at least a resistance to meaning.  Maybe it's
wrong to talk about language at all in this way -- something about all
this is starting to feel a little screwy.  But I always end up here when
I think about language, it's just a mystery to me, never really makes
sense.

And yet there's faith, as I posted a while ago, and I have some kind of
faith in it, and here I am confidently using language.  And thinking
it's no coincidence that in my little tract on the philosophy of science
I mentioned parenthetically the belief that the universe is orderly and
predictable as massively undersupported by the available evidence (by
definition really) and yet a tacit premise in all scientific argument.
Evolution again, adaptive understanding?  Or nietzschean again, the idea
that we might be imposing this order on our experience.  (Strange, his
intersection with and antipathy toward Darwin.)  I don't know where to
go with this -- why I try not to think about the big stuff too much
anymore.

But for poetry -- maybe there is a sort of double vision, to perceive
the brute sign, its sound its shape, as well as the meaning it carries,
and also the usual contexts of that meaning, and the other meanings that
sign can carry, and so on.  Multiple, rather than just double,
perception.  And for the scientist too, who observes carefully in order
to find the right explanation eventually.  For that, you need only turn
to Kafka's maxim that all sins originate in impatience.  That one's
close to my heart.  What I'd like to be thinking about, instead of the
unwieldy issues here, are these questions of discipline, attention --
good word, recently discussed a bit here -- care.  "No where in man,"
wrote Charles Olson, "is there room for carelessness."  That one's close
to my heart too.

Enough for now, too much even,
Pat

does anyone believe that actually considering Adorno's more significant
works (besides an isolated review, of which he has written volumes, and a
single questionable letter) might also be legitimate criteria to consider in
evaluating him; and more importantly, does anybody really care what kind of
a person Adorno was?  what does that have to do with the significance of
Dialectic of Enlightenment or Negative Dialectics.  Surely we don't have to
rehash the Pound debate that raged on this list 6 months ago or so.

 Peter's piece on Oppen and women is a topic that could be expanded multiple
times, since many poets (m) have had interesting relations with poets and
others of the female persuasion. Indeed, given that there are probably 4
genders easily (male, female, boy, girl), and that they are going to be all
mixed up----proof that there are 4 genders: see Freud on girls. Any of the
essays on sexuality, the oedipus complex. Anyway, my opinion is that George
was a man and a girl both. I won't myself flirt and ask if "anyone is intereste
d" in my comments, nor do I want to lurk. Oppen was rather more egalitarian
and accepting of women as artistic producers than many males I ran into, or
up against, in approx. 1965. He seemed curious as to what would emerge from
women, and seemed to recognize that that "sector" was under-represented and
poorly treated in culture at that moment. This curiosity had a number of
sources in his life and politics (I won't go thru them all); One might have
been the political culture of the left, including the CP "line" on (i.e.
sort of against) male chauvinism. (Their term.) He saw women, as he saw
men, as comrades in poetry. He demanded a great deal of both groups; he
pursued a real committment to poetry and to the ethics and seriousness of
the word. Anyone raised a female (and others, possibly) know well that
some of that up-raising is debilitating, makes you want others to treat you
just a little more nicely, kid gloves, all that. Almost 100% (in my view,
this is my opinion only) George did not; he didn't play that game. It was
bracing. AND YET, he loved women--a deep, fantasy-laden love for women
as vulnerable, as strong, as desirable, as independent, as a very special
kind of companion. So he put his intensity and grasp of things in your way
and didn't soft-pedal. He would say things like "put your intelligence
into your poems" which just about no one was saying to young women in
approx 1967. It is hard to reconstruct how drenched in a gut wrenching
disregard for women and girls our culture was just a few decades back, how
difficult it was to be a promising young women artist, how blasting it was
to navigate the hypocricies and barriers that many men, old and young, threw
down for you. And how internalized complaisance and minority were for
young women. [para. break] Despite his ethos of sincerity and his horror
of the un-won (which shriveled 99% of poetry for him), he could be played
false--and it is often in his writing on women. Aldon Nielsen was the first
to point to the weird voyeurism of race and gender in "The Zulu girl" and
I am not fond of the slight sentimentalizing of women at the end of Of
Being Numerous ("my daughter my daughter"). There's a lot more to be said.
Those interested in pursuing it might check the Letters. I tried very hard
to identify, isolate, and propose the places where Oppen opined on women,
and these are set forth in the index I prepared to the letters (p. 434).
The thing that he didn't like--he would go (as he did on Levertov) ballistic,
was any time he felt a women poet was being "a good girl." That was very
bracing, indeed, given everything, and I have tried hard to stay un-good
forever after. (The "good girl" are my words, not his.) OK girlfriends (and
possibly boyfriends)--that's my post. Rachel

Well,those Europeans. I mean, how many times have you heard that a serious
composer has introduced jazz inflections (or folk) into his composition,
and you listen to it and wonder what he thinks jazz might be?

Or Robert Duncan. Once he told me and someone else that he had been
listening to jazz, and was newly interested in incorporating jazz rhythms
or something. I was all agog over Charles Tyler and Marion Brown at the
time, so I asked him what jazz, for instance. He said, oh you know, Noel

(my messages apparently keep getting etherized rather than tabled, so one
more try...)

A very hasty (because pressed for time) response to Tom Mandel's post
(perhaps just to get the ball rolling...)--

Thanks for the reference to the review in Die Musik.  I would be very
interested to hear what anyone who knows the Adorno bibliography well has
to say about this.

Treating the attack not simply as ad hominem (which it was), a couple of
quick points:

--Arendt's record on denunciation is far from spotless--witness her
silence vis-a-vis Heidegger's silence.

--Adorno's response to Benjamin's Baudelaire piece (letter of 10 Nov.
1938) might well be described as bullying (and may indeed have had a very
serious effect on Benjamin's work on the Arcades project and his relation
to the Institute), but his objections are far from trivial.  They raise
very important questions about the relationship between Benjamin's
critical procedure and his Marxism.  See, for starters, the brief piece
(called 'The Frog and the Prince', I think) in Giorgio Agamben's _Infancy
and History_.

--Yes, Benjamin was "a genius of [whatever] magnitude" and Adorno, in his
later work, is deeply indebted to him (and acknowledges it: see the essay
on WB in _Prisms_ and sundry comments in _Aesthetic Theory_; and indeed,
the famous remark that got this thread going should surely be read in the
context of WB's great thesis about culture and barbarism in "Theses on the
Philosophy of History").

--Likening Adorno to Paul de Man seems hazardous indeed, not least because
the burden of Adorno's work from _Dialectic of Enlightenment_ on (and
earlier too, I dare say) was the most sustained and serious attempt to
grapple with the implications of the Nazi (and Stalin) era (to dismiss all
this as 'self-aggrandizing' is simply a refusal to read--which is not to
say that Adorno is not often a pain in the neck to read)

And let me toss out this question (probably rhetorical): doesn't the
gesture of removing Adorno from the constellation in which Benjamin's work
was written (and should arguably be read) constitute a refusal to face the
political questions Benjamin raises?

Well, that's my scuffle with the gauntlet Tom Mandel threw down ... who's
next?

Dear Peter Quartermain,
Unfortunately I had to miss your talk at the Poetry Center - but, indeed
congratultions on the swelling of attention the subject it has caused!
I was drawn to your post in which you suggest something to the effect that
George was unique - with the exception of some gay men - in his interest in
work by young women - feminists - in the early seventies. (Your post
disappeared but I think that's a fair approximation of what you suggested?)

I think that remark really mis-reads the condition of poetry in the Bay Area
in the late sixties and early seventies. I want to assume you are familiar
with Momo's Press(??) of which I - who am not gay - was the publisher. It was
a very robust period - especially in terms of the writing that emerged with
the quite wild emergence of various and often angry liberations (feminist,
gay men, lesbians, Latino, Black, Asian, etc.) It was a prolific period in
terms of large public readings, magazines and books. My magazine Shocks was
partly so named on account of all the friction in the air and sought to
critically make some sense of it. Momo's as you might know published first
books of Beverly Dahlen and Jessica Hagedorn. Across the Bay, Shameless Hussy
and The Women's Press collective were publishing first books of Alta, Ntozake
and Judy Grahn among others. The new writers made no bones about centering a
new politics within the practice of the poem. For women poets who had been
shaped by a male dominated anarchist or apolitical poetics , or those who had
been involved with a male-dominated-with-queen-attached matrix (New York
school?) - the cross over into an activist poetry that directly challenged a
variety of social constructs was a dangerous thing to do.
Oppen - who in I my awareness of him made it part of his life to attend to
the young and what was going on - was highly attentive and naturally
responsive to the unrest. I think it would have been quite unlike him to have
remained oblivious. (He once complimented me in letter of thanks for sending
him an issue of Shocks as indeed "shocking"). Indeed I believe he was
  challenged - and perhaps to a degree threatened by the vigor of what was
taking place. Intellectually - as a secular and progressive pluralist - I
suspect he was all for it. Emotionally I suspect it probably felt dangerous
to him and the world of male centered modernism of which he was still in the
weave. But as a responsible elder, one who had partly been put back on the
map by the young, I think he didn't shy, "rightly or wrongly", from the
paternal role of taking part.

I don't know if you ever read the final "Poetry Reading" issue of Shocks
#7-8-9 - about 350 pages long - it includes my own account of readings in the
Bay Area from the early sixties into the mid-seventies, as well as accounts
by Frances Jaffer, Jessica Hagedorn and Thulani Davis. If you haven't, I
think it would help fill out the context of this period of Oppen's life.
SPD still has a copies of The Poetry Reading - I'm personally down to a
couple.  If you are further interested in other issues of Shocks and the

Re: Bennett`s request for information on A&L:

This`ll be vague, coming straight off the top of my head but,
Charles Harrison, Terry Atkinson and another bloke whose name I
forget form A&L around `66 (possibly two years later?) and all work at
the art college in Coventry.  Can probably be regarded as the first
English conceptualists; they begin an eponymous journal which
publishes their own articles and articles by overseas artists with
whom they establish contact, esp. Joseph Kosuth and Sol Le Witt.
Their writings draw on Wittgensteinian theory of language and
philosophies of mind, with strong commitment to Marxism, and, among
other things, work to theorise the extension of the art object along
all axes.  Early seventies, the college appoints a new principal
whose first act in office is to sack all the A&L people.

Atkinson breaks with the others in, I think, `74.  (I have a strange
account by TA himself of the acrimonious split, to do with what he
sees as a stultifying hierarchy emerging in the group, with Harrison
and acolytes as the managerial class, as they work on their big
Indexing project.  Atkinson retreats more and more to his own studio
and begins to identify secretly with Rimbaud as a rebellious
precursor, then starts working on
a series of figurative/landscape works set in WW1 - what he sees as
the polar opposite of the Indexing...)

Harrison is an author, editor, reviewer (he reviewed Thomas Crow`s
new book in the latest Art Forum) and has published a book of essays
on A&L.  Atkinson is still a practising artist and occasionally
writes (usually polemical) pieces for British art magazines,
crticizing Harrison`s "revisionist" account of the A&L thing, or
having a go at the neo-conceptualists who are revising A&L`s
ground-breaking work in the direction of the market.

Can`t fill you in on how they linked up with Red Krayola but I do
know all the words to Portrait of V.I. Lenin in the Style of Jackson
Pollock, Part One (the standout track from the KANGAROO album and
named after an actual series of paintings by A&L).

I have some material at home which, when consulted, could settle the
dates  and allow me to expand on any of this if people are
interested.

Mark,

I don't think that you should read into my comments (or Tom's, or
Bill's, or James Sherry's or Kit Robinson's or Bob Harrison's or Alan
Bernheimer's or Colleen Lookingbill's or Barry Cox's or any writer
involved in the information industry (nice oxymoron, that)) that the
computer industry is in any way "better" than the academy. It is raw
capitalism plain and simple. Whenever I am with any of the above, we
tend to be as (or more) harsh about it than we are the academy.
However, it does have its rewards. The pay, the toys, being able to
work in a field that changes rapidly and seldom bores.... Being raw
capital, the politics of it tend to be straightforward, though there
are exceptions to that.

However, there is a privilege that the academy (I hate that
generalization, but can't think of anything better at 7 AM) takes on
with respect to poetry (and thus this list) that I think tends to irk
at least me. Certainly the evidence of the 20th century has been that
cities, not schools, have been the significant sites for literature,
and the 19th, 18th, 17th centuries, etc., were no different. Better to
be in DC, NY, SF, Boston, San Diego than to attend, say, Stanford,
Buffalo, Iowa City or wherever. Not that schools don't have a value,
but their importance will never even remotely approach their self
importance.

Case in point: there is, in the current issue of the MLA publication,
The Profession, which is sort of the theoretical journal of the meat
market that's about to hit DC, on working in the computer industry by
somebody who has been out in the job market for all of one year. There
are literally thousands of ex-grad students, PhDs, etc, outside of the
academy, many of whom have been that way for 3 or 4 decades (the CEO of
my company was an English major who started with a summer job as a
secretary, then became a programmer with no experience whatsoever, and
just forgot to go back to grad school), but this is who they found.
While I'm sure the theory may have been that he was at or near the
level of most job-seeking grad students today, his freshness off the
reservation really shows. His motivation (better surfing in San Diego
than in Iowa) says it all.

------

Aside on the novels of Harry Matthews. There is a member of this list
(whom I shall not reveal, though he may choose to do so himself) who
once upon a time was employed editing the Collected Novels of HM when
at, I believe, MacMillan. However, it was slow going and the folks
upstairs did not really think it was going to be a best seller, so got
on his case to get some other books out. One little item that he did
choose, just to get them off his back, was a "Christmas item" called
_Jonathon Livingston Seagull_. Later, when he left the company, the
book was homeless until Random House picked it up.

Here's a question, thinking of Matthews, Calvino, Queneau, Roubaud:
what determines who among the Oulipolians (Oulipuddlians?) became
"popular," got translated, etc.?

Another question: Can anyone tell me what the origin of the phrase "the
ghost in the machine" happens to be?

Thanks,

This is particularly interesting here in terms of a recent reaction
against Cronenebrg's _Crash_ in various newspapers. It is now being
dismissed in long articles for being _boring_, and whatever excitment
and acclaim the movie has generated is now attributed to narratives
being generated by reviewers "drunk from the potent cocktail of
advertising" blah blah blah.

What becomes rapidly obvious is that "boring" means in violation of
Aristotelian narrative structure which assumes not just the telling of
an event but a specific organization of the telling, one that
generates suspense, rising tensions, catharsis, etc. Cronenberg uses
the narrative form of the pornographic movie as the pop culture
generic structure he hangs his images on--one sex scene follows
another with the focus always on the spectacle of the bodies, not the
connection between the scenes.

It's a poetics of the image in which meaning hovers without
proceeding. An early image for instance lovingly shows
Spader/Ballard's severely wrecked leg encased in a cage of stainless
steel and leather with large screws penetrating the flesh. And then
there's the car wash scene, which I won't go into here, but involves
an intricate and brutal human voyeurism/eroticism encased within a
machine that itself is encased within another machine that is "making
love" to it. It becomes unclear whether the eroticism of the machines
is mirroring the human or whethere the human is mirroring the machines
it is encased within. It would take a poem to match what Cronenberg
does visually, because only a poem could unleash the unresovable
simultanaeity, the almost overwhelming and threatening power of
meaning hovering around the spectacle.

I think this is where I'd argue with you, Pat. We, too, live in a
time where everything carries meaning, where everything is a sign
requiring interpretation, but what they have to tell us is so sinister
that we compose lives in resistance to reading them. We prefer the
narrative that supplies us with the quick social fix. Whereas a
sensitivity and alertness to what Wystam calls our violent tastes
could, at the very least, cut us loose into some pretty scary
territory.

The omnibus volume Harper published in I think 72 including all three
of Harry's novels to that date (The Conversions, Tlooth, and Sinking of
the Odradrek Stadium) was *my* idea. I suggested it to Harry's then
agent and to Macmillan where I was then working  (having dropped out of
grad school and moved to NY). Naturally, Macmillan didn't get it, and
the idea was then proposed to an editor then working at Harpers
(McCullough? -- cannot bring her name out of the mist, sorry) and who
had been interested in the New York school -- she'd published Great
Balls of Fire (Padgett), Space (Coolidge) and Lewis Macadam's first
book (again I can't bring it forth).

I had originally called his agent because I was looking for a copy of
Tlooth -- having loaned mine into some friendly whirlwind or other.

Altho Macmillan didn't publish the volume, my proposal led to meeting
Harry. A good thing.

Ron (and others who might be interested...)

The phrase "ghost in the machine" comes from Gilbert Ryle's 1949 book _The
Concept of Mind_, in which he discusses "the dogma of the Ghost in the
Machine" which maintains that "...there are mechanical causes of corporeal
movements and mental causes of corporeal movements (p. 22)."  Lest anyone
think I'm an expert on _nous_, this info comes from the OED, to which I, as
a librarian, have quick and easy access. My initial impulse in answering
this question was to yell "Sting!"

nice to be back alive, with a new floppy drive, to boot...

not to even attempt to steal thunder from rob hardin aka fantoma's fanboy
catfight epicurean unseen legend -- but, uhm, george, i did in fact mention
*ride the high country* (way back on 2 december)... there's been so many
posts on this thread that it's just difficult as hell not to miss
something... still, i wouldn't want you to think that nobody around here
had called attention to this latter... what i like about this flick esp. is
the mix of villainy and loyalty represented by scott's character, and good
ole joel is excellent as usual... and there are some darker undercurrents
in the film that seem to be only hinted at (i suspect the cutting room
floor here)...

i think rob's right, though, george, even though i do understand what
you're getting at... sure, you miss a valuable dimension of leone, say, w/o
having seen the ford stuff (and again, w/o having seen kurosawa---*a
fistful of dollars* is at times a scene-for-scene remake of *yojimbo*,
albeit different in technique)... on the other hand, there's something to
be said for NOT picking up on those references (if you will), for doing the
historical thing in reverse...

this, you might say, is an advantage of the present vis-a-vis the past...
though of course one might wanna be wise about such retro-viewings...

Rushed and random as ever, I'm afraid, but here goes:

-- apologies to all for the repetition of my response to Tom Mandel's
post on Adorno--lurker's ineptitude

-- there was absolutely no suggestion intended that Arendt's record was
marked by collaboration; as to what she says about Adorno in the
correspondence with Jaspers, I've yet to make it to the library, but am
indebted to Tom for the reference and for the information about the review
in question

-- I was not intending to be "corrective" of Tom's revulsion, nor was I
trying to draw him into a debate in which he does not wish to participate
(the backchanneling was, again, a matter of having fumbs for thingers).  I
took it that he posted the information and his opinion to prompt serious
debate--at least among those who are interested in Adorno and the issues
of aesthetics and politics (which are often rehearsed on this list).  For
this reason, I was concerned that the ad hominem attack would simply
result in a complete refusal to read Adorno and engage in such debate.
The key question, it seems to me, is how these revelations--and I'd be
very interested to have more info. (on the list or backchannel)--should
affect the understanding of Adorno's work.  Does the work itself, in the
thirties and later, have a collaborationist agenda?  This would be very
tough to prove, I think, but the question remains to be argued out.  And
even if it were to be demonstrated, would this mean that the significant
post-War work is no longer of interest?  As a result, the comparison with
de Man does not seem instructive to me (ok, "likening" was careless, but
instructive comparisons are not formed on the basis of unlike things).
Again, this remains to be argued (no, Tom, I'm not trying to draw you into
the whole unwelcome business again); at present, it is no more than
innuendo.

-- no argument, though, about the dogmatism (and racism) of the jazz
writing (which others have mentioned).  It's curious that some of his
rabid opinions on jazz were published under the pseudonym "Hektor
Rottweiler"--one almost suspects (contrary to all evidence) that the guy
had a sense of humor. (As several critics have pointed out, however,
his writings on the dialectics of Schoenberg's work in fact apply
remarkably well to the development of jazz).

Anyway, that's more than enough from me

Damn. You just reminded me of a day long ago in Vancouver, when Duncan held
up a copy of _Letters_ and said it was the last one for sale (I dont know,
$2.50 maybe) and I leapt forward but was bodychecked by Pauline Butling,
who snaffled it! I have never forgiven her.

Oh yeah, Pierre. Jesus, I forgot to mention Ernest Haycocks. Hmm. He was a
truly great writer, I thought and still suspect it. He seemed somehow
serious, as if there could be such a thing as a genre epic or something.
Then he invented Destry, and they did weird things with him, musicals and
all;

I have sometimes heard from people in Germany, etc., who grew up on US
westerns, and always thought that normal; when I was teaching in Berlin,
all the students were interested in Black people in the US and Native
people in Canada.

You know, about 10 years ago or 15 or something, I taught a graduate course
on the "western". First we looked at two movies, the Robert taylor Billy
the Kid, and a Randolph Scott Botticher, then read _Hondo_ and then did all
those literary takes you mention.

The students in this course were really good, all turned out to be writers,
and still remember that semester well. There's something there; it made me
write my western novels, too. A strange year.

You must know David Markson's western that was made silly in a movie
starring Frank Sinatra.

Matt Hill, Publisher of Marshall Creek Press has just issued this release:

New to the avant-garde, alternative poetry scene, we are endeavoring to
publish authors who are in pursuit of the oblique:  writing that depicts the
"original fire" in the study of causes, and imagery that introduces textual
impurities into the posturing and malaise which predominate in the
contemporary poetry scene today.

We are committed to underwriting the experimental synthesis of poetic visions
where obscure language achieves the climactic event of congealed process.

The following chapbooks are currently available with several more to follow
in 1997.  We are in serious need of benefactors and sponsors for future
offerings and welcome any support in the form of contributions and grants.

I may have missed earlier comments on this thread, but I've always connected
"ghost in the machine" with the dramaturgical technique of deus ex machina.
Which maybe also has a prior mythological or religious basis. - H. Gould

along the lines that patrick and tom are moving -- esp. the question of
evolution and meaning -- i can't recommend strongly enough richard powers'
novel from a few years ago, _the gold bug variations_... i know of no piece
of writing that pushes the language/dna analogy further, and with more
emphasis on narrative as a correlative development...

like ron, i too read that _profession 96_ piece on surfing and tech.
writing with two eyebrows raised... it's not only that the writer comes off
as green, it's that related controversies are mooted throughout---such as
those having to do with whether doing the work the writer describes really
requires a phud in english, finally...

i think not...

and sooner or later, but probably sooner, the number of such tech. writing
jobs available for phuds in english will probably taper off... b/c the
number of managerial jobs will taper off... in fact, this is what's being
proposed in that piece---entry into the managerial ranks, via a phud in
english... the phud manages other writers, writing, etc... which is, again,
to ignore what the tech. writing field constitutes, esp. post wwii, in the
way of corporate-academic collusion (it's one thing to *do* tech. writing,
whatever it is, it's another to permit corporations to dictate how tech.
writing will be taught)...

in any case, reading through this issue of _profession_ constitutes a good
introduction to just how at odds with ourselves we academics can be... the
mag. begins with "literary study in the transnational university," j.
hillis miller's gloss on that book i mentioned some time ago, bill
readings' _the university in ruins_ (in which miller skillfully underwrites
and understates readings' notion that the university is becoming a
transnational *corporation*); continues through some nice if somewhat
obvious ideas by leroy searle on educating students about education; offers
up some real polemic from cary nelson re how to recast the mla (a
refreshing, if a bit insular view of the profession); provides us with john
guillory's critique of "preprofessionalism" in grad. studies (which would
be ok were it not for the fact that what guillory describes as, finally, a
"phantasmic deformation of professional desire" is ALSO a very real, very
programmatic trend in academe, as indicated by the growing number of
*preprofessional* degrees on, uhm, my campus)...

there is some value, perhaps, in discussing self-loathing in this
context... academics and intellectuals can be damned good at it (as can
certain ethnicities)... engineers, the crowd with which i used to hang,
have a peculiarly self-aggrandizing self-conception... this is largely
owing, as i see it, to their relative inability or unwillingness to contend
with the broader social/cultural context of their work... robert pinsky has
a nice piece in the recent _doubletake_ on precisely this phenomenon,
"nerds, technocrats, and enlightened spirits" (there's also a piece on
poetry i found incredibly retro, by the poetry editorial adviser, edward
hirsch, "how to read these poems"... UGH)...

anyway, _profession 96_ would make an excellent stocking stuffer for those
of you with academic friends...

hurry while the supply lasts!...

etc...

Designed and coordinated by NSA, the ECHELON
system is used to intercept ordinary e-mail,
fax, telex, and telephone communications
carried over the world's telecommunications
networks. Unlike many of the electronic spy
systems developed during the Cold War, ECHELON
is designed primarily for non-military
targets: governments, organizations,
businesses, and individuals in virtually every
country. It potentially affects every person
communicating between (and sometimes within)
countries anywhere in the world.

The ECHELON system is not designed to
eavesdrop on a particular individual's e-mail
or fax link. Rather, the system works by
indiscriminately intercepting very large
quantities of communications and using
computers to identify and extract messages of
interest from the mass of unwanted ones. A
chain of secret interception facilities has
been established around the world to tap into
all the major components of the international
telecommunications networks. Some monitor
communications satellites, others land-based
communications networks, and others radio
communications. ECHELON links together all
these facilities, providing the US and its
allies with the ability to intercept a large
proportion of the communications on the
planet.

Re: Jeremy's new post:

Adorno did not collaborate, he attempted to ingratiate himself and the
indication is - perhaps is - that he'd have been happy if his
only-half-Jewishness allowed for this.

Many people collaborated, most passively, during the Nazi regime. Many
people had very, very little choice (other than martyrdom). Some of
them did horrid things. Some of them killed Jews (or gipsies, or...),
and some even got used to doing it. Some just ran railroad switches on
tracks that led to camps. Some were soldiers, some worked in factories
replacing soldiers.

One or more of them killed many of my relatives.

That's not what we are talking about. It's not for me to condemn or
forgive someone in whose shoes I haven't walked and who is a
hypothetical figure conjured out of an abstract noun. "He" may have
rolled my aunt Kiki into the grave at age 18 after she was multiply
raped (or not who knows?). I don't know. I'm not in front of a
collaborationist. I don't know if I'd kill him or pity him or what I'd
do. It's not really relevant.

Anymore than it's relevant to say as another posteur did that this one
review (among so many volumes of them) and one letter have no weight
against the volumes of Adorno's work.

There are no "works" that are not also "persons." It is what Adorno did
that we or someone should discuss -- not some 2d-order abstraction like
what it "means" or its "place" in his work, but What He Did. And we
should remember that this refers to 1934 and to 1964, to both.

It is in this sense that my original remarks were "ad hominem." It
should be obvious to anyone who has ever related to or relied on
another's words -- written or spoken -- that they are deeds; it should
be obvious to poets, and I hope to those interested in poetry too, that
word and world are one.

Adorno wrote himself into a room out of which you will not retrieve
him. It is in that room that we must describe him. As in all other
bodies of mind, each of his texts is inside all the others, and each
englobes all the others. His review of Baldur von Shirach and his
letter attempting to explain it away is inside every other word he
wrote and every word he wrote is inside the review and the letter. I
didn't make it that way, sorry. He did.

Now maybe we can talk about the subject. I'd be especially interested
to hear what Marjorie Perloff thinks, as there are few people I've read
who have as astute a sense of the relation among the forces of social
intention and context in a writer's work as Marjorie.

I wrote this last night before reading Tom Mandel' current posting. I'm not
sure if it takes us where  the discussion could go. I'll let others judge
that. Anyway...

Since Tom Mandel's original posting, I've been bothered by one problem: can
reprehensible thinkers provide non-reprehenisible ways of thinking beyond
our present crises (Bloch: "Thinking means venturing beyond."). The events
in Adorno's life which Tom relates do not show us Adorno at his best, to
say the least, but as others have asked, are there parts of his work which
retain some value?
        I have had some Adornoids attempt to explain to me some of TAs work
in a more favorable light. For instance, it is not uncommon to maintain
that his much-maligned writings on jazz, for instance, much be
contextualized. He is criticizing, I'm often told, not the sort of jazz
Anselm Hollo and the rest of us assumes he is criticizing, but rather a
mass-produced, tin-pan-alley-type of german import that was sort of a
forerunner to muzak which is a pale imitation of American jazz (i.e., the
equivalent of the late and unlamented {in terms of career} Vanilla Ice in
rap). Whatever, it's an attempt to salvage Adorno, and it makes some sense
                                                   Though it still doesn't
let TA of the hook for his complete ignorance of jazz, so I don't by it.
And Adorno on mass culture is barely distinguishable from Allen Bloom, as
we all have noted. And Tom Mandel makes a good case for his toad-like
nature. Are there other merits in his work?
        A couple of years ago, I came across this line in Murray Bookchin's
_The Philosophy of Social Ecology_ In the introduction, Bookchin writes
about the big difference between this edition (published by Black Rose
Books) and the 1990 edition: "I have excised favorable references to the
Frankfurt School and Theodor Adorno. Like Leszek Kolakowski, I have come to
regard much of Adorno's work as intellectually irresponsible, wayward, and
poorly theorized, despite the brilliance of his style (at times) and his
often insightful epigrams. This is not to reject his defense of speculative
reason against positivism-- which was what originally attracted me to his
work and to the Frankfurt school-- even has his writings exude enormous
pessimism about reason and its destiny."  Now, at that time I had been
reading Adorno, largely based on a reading of earlier versions of some of
the same essays Bookchin reprinted in _Philosophy of Social Ecology_, so I
wrote him c/o his publisher to ask him about thie irresponsible, wayward
theorizing. When Bookchin (or an associate) wrote back, he mentioned the
same events Tom Mandel related, as well as an elaboration on Adorno's
complete inability to avoid thinking hierarchically. MB was much more
articulate than I am right now, and I can't find the letter for a direct
quote, but some footnotes in _TPSE_ are worth looking at (but not right
now)
        Recently, I'm more inclined toward the "heretical marxism" of some
figures tangentially affiliated w/ the Frankfurt school (I'm stealing the
idea of "heretical marxism" from an article by Ramsey Eric Ramsey (not a
typo) from _Rethinking Marxism_ (vol 8 #2, summer 1995), so I'm thinking of
the work of Ernst Bloch mostly, but also parts of Wilheml Reich (when he's
not reifying --if not deifying-- the orgasm) and Erich Fromm (in the rare
moments when he's not turning Buddha into a dialectical materialist and/or
Karl Marx into a roshi).
        And I hope I'm nodding off because it's late and not because I'm
boring myself.
        Anyway, to quote Bloch again, "Thinking means venturing beyond."
Can anything in Adorno's work be made fruitful enough for us to bother
venturing beyond his toad nature?

and let me add the same postscript others have added: if an answer to these
questions will lead to a replay of the Pound argument, either delete this

Well, I just got back from the local Waldenbooks at my nearby mall, where I
discovered that they were all out of _Profession 96_. However, a helpful
clerk directed me to the Association of Departments of English Bulletin
(shelved, coincidently, next to Soldier of Fortune). It's not as
interesting as the previously-described Profession 96, but it contains an
article by Reed Way Dasenbrock called "The Crisis in the Job Market: Beyond
Scapegoating." This article, in turn, contains a passage unlike any other
I've seen written by a chair of a phud-granting English Dept: "The real
change I propose is this: that we break the habit of relying solely on
graduate assistants to staff the courses that we haven't wanted to teach.
We need to teach them ourselves as well. In turn, we should propse to the
administration that we replace many GA's with tenure-track positions and
that the tenure-track faculty (in it's entirity; not just the new lines)
teach those lower division courses that would no longer be taught by
graduate assistants."  After checking to make sure that I wasn't reading a
special April Fools Day edition of the ADE Bulletin, I put the magazine
back on the shelf, fairly confident that the institutional changes
Dasenbrock calls for won't happen in too many places, but somewhat
encouraged to see someone in "the profession" fess up to the material
conditions of "knowledge production" in engdepts.

yet what i find so troubling about that article you cite, david, is that
its author seems not to notice that his comments apply specifically to sop
at "major research institutions" with phud programs... where i teach, and
where for that matter so many of my friends teach, there's no provision for
grad. students to teach lower-level courses... i mean, it's probably a safe
bet that *most* "lower-level" teaching in *most* english depts. around the
country is not done by ta's, but by full-fledged profs...

it's just that i wouldn't want non-academics around here to think that we
profs. are all leaving the "dirty work" or some such to others (and no,
it's not dirty work to teach engl. 101!)... for my part, i've never had a
ta teach 'for' me, and i don't look forward to having one do so...

best,

To Poetics: I'm forwarding this response from a friend who concentrates
his thinking mostly on Adorno and Benjamin.  2 problems here: he doesn't
have the advantage of reading the other posts, so he repeats some
commentary; and he chose to copy the entire message, so I apologize in
advance for the digesters.

So I finally got myself The Granite Pail, Cid Corman's 1985 selection of
Lorine Neidecker's work.  Here are two blurbs on the back cover.

"One of the finest American poets of all, besides being easily the finest
female American poet..."

"We are in the presence of a poet whose peers are the Lady Ono Komachi and
Sappho.  Few others come to mind."

This is kind of shocking, yes?  How do things like this happen?

Judy,
When I recommended Neidecker's work, I didn't think about the blurbs,
and when I read the book, I hate to turn it over to see them.

How it happens? That's not a question, right?

Joe, I'm confused here as to whether, by "full-fledgd profs," you simply
mean folks with PhDs, or folks who are tenure-track. it's the latter I
think of as "full-fledged," but I think it's clear that the former, along
with grad students, teach the bulk of lower-level courses at colleges &
universities throughout the US (e.g., classes not for majors, frosh
classes, & some intro-level "study of lit" or survey-type courses). Is
this untrue at your school?

I say this because, in my view, the problems for grad students are more
than anything else a consequence of the revolution in academic conduct
toward the use (i.e., abuse) of part-time, adjunct, &  temporary faculty --
& if *these* problems could be solved (most radically, by demanding that
*only* tenure-track, "professional" adjuncts [e.g., G. Stephanapolous,
people with professions outside the academy], or grad students could
teach) & with proper & fiscally-unavoidable controls on size of grad
programs, schools would have to even out the supply/demand problems that
cause such hardships today...

Does your experience differ from this?

david, by "full-fledged profs" (confusing term, that) i *was* thinking
tenure-track profs---i was thinking that it's misleading to characterize
english profs. in terms of their presumed access to t.a. labor... but in
light of how this term can itself be exclusive, i'd be happy to modify it
to include anybody BUT grad students teaching on their *home*
campus---whether tenure-track, part-time, adjunct, etc. (of course i don't
mean to wish away differences between these various prof. categories)...
seems to me, given the sheer number of colleges and universities (and i
mean to include community colleges) that most english depts. don't *have*
graduate students upon whom they can rely to teach so-called basic writing
and the like for absurdly low wages (and no benefits)... and on some
campuses, like u of michigan (i'm thinking of their english composition
board), there's an entire staff for teaching such courses (no comment here
as to how that works out)...

anybody have any numbers on this handy?... i suppose i can go rummage
around for same...

but anyway, on my campus:  we've been known to hire grad. students from
local institutions (u of chicago, depaul, loyola, uic) to pick up our
intro-level writing courses... but we don't have any grad. students
ourselves to teach such courses... so i see the people we hire, again, as
'full fledged profs.' relative to my campus (some have been around for
years teaching german and french)... now we hire such folks only when the
number of required intro courses (based on enrollment) exceeds what we who
are full-time tenure-track can do (and all full-time tenure-track english
profs. teach one or two intro writing courses in the fall, depending on
other course demands)...

i was thinking that the excerpt dave z. posted here from dasenbrock's
article would make very little sense, or carry very little urgency, on many
campuses with which i'm familiar, incl. my own... i mean, what does it mean
to me when somebody sez, you shouldn't use your t.a.'s to teach thus & so
courses?... very little---i don't have any t.a.'s, and iit will *still* go
out and hire t.a.'s from other campuses as adjunct labor... how many
colleges (not universities) have their own grad. students to teach their
freshman/sophomore writing requirements?... the problem of course has to do
with disparities across the english profession---we're not all inhabiting
the same world... but in any case, david, i think pointing as you do to the
hiring of adjunct faculty is precisely to the point...

anyway, maybe i'm being clearer than i was... hope so!... let me know, pleez...

best,

joe

I entirely agree with Tom about words and deeds.  But to establish words
and deeds in this instance is going to require more information (the
review and letter in question and the context of their publication).  My
sense, after doing a little digging, is that these pieces are not easy to
come by (not in translation, anyway, and I have to confess that my German
wouldn't be up to the task even if the journals in question were available
in the library here).  Reading the originals is important because without
doing so it is difficult to establish whether Adorno was foolish and naive
or downright despicable (and, by the same token, whether his letter of
1966 is evasive or not).

At present, we have Hannah Arendt's comments in her letters to Jaspers
(and Kohler and Saner's notes to those letters).  Arendt revulsion for
Adorno seems to go back to 1929 when A. rejected her husband's
Habilitationschrift.  In her biography of Arendt, Elisabeth Young-Bruehl
writes: "Hannah Arendt's opinions about people, both positive and
negative, were always forceful--even if not always consistent--and she
clearly meant it when she announced to Gunther Stern [her husband] after
having made Adorno's acquaintance, 'Der kommt uns nicht ins Haus!' (That
one's not coming into our house)"  (_Hannah Arendt: For Love of the
World_, p.80).  In mentioning this I'm not trying to extricate A. from the
room he put himself in (as Tom put it); I'm simply trying to give a
context for Arendt's dramatic expression of her hatred for Adorno ("one of
the most repulsive human beings I know"--oddly, the context for that
remark is her expressed wish that attacks on Heidegger--which she claims,
without proof, are being orchestrated by "the Wiesengrund-Adorno
crowd"--(and specifically attacks on his anti-semitism) would cease).

The question of the name-changing (this is Tom's 'perhaps'):  as I
understand it, the claim is that A. dropped the Wiesengrund part of his
name in order to ingratiate himself with the Nazis.  Martin Jay describes
this as 'highly implausible', noting that A. only dropped Wiesengrund in
1938 (by which time he was in America) on the instigation of Friedrich
Pollock (a Frankfurt Institute colleague).  This is not to say that A.
might not have dropped the Wiesengrund for the review in question; I
simply don't know.

In his monumental history of the Frankfurt School, Rolf Wiggershaus has
this to say about the review: "Adorno still [summer 1934] believed in the
possibility of hibernating through everything that was going on, and in
one of his music reviews, which were published increasingly rarely, he
produced an example of political opportunism.  He wrote a review of
Herbert Muntzel's _The Banner of the Persecuted: A Cycle for Male Choir
after the Volume of Poems of the Same Title by Baldur von Schirach_ which
was published in the respected music journal _Die Musik_.  At that point
the journal had not been fully forced into line.  Adorno emphasized -
approvingly - the fact that this cycle was 'marked out as consciously
National Socialist by its choice of Schirach's poems' and that it called
for 'the image of a new Romanticism', 'perhaps of the type which Goebbels
has defined as "Romantic Realism"'.  He added this praise to the
observation that it could very well happen that, 'with increasing
compositional rigour, Romantic harmony, but rather to a new one, which
incorporates contrapuntal energies within itself.'"  I find this
frustratingly oblique and it is remarkable that Wiggershaus doesn't have
more to say about this episode (not being very familiar with A.'s writing
on music I find it hard to say whether those last remarks are intended to
be a piece of smuggled critique or not).  I can't find any reference in
this huge book to the later letter.  What adjective would one wish to
place before Wiggershaus's "political opportunism"?  Dangerously naive?
Despicable?  It is certainly easy *with hindsight* to settle for the
latter.

All this brings me to the interesting question Tom raises: 'every word is
englobed in every other' (he says, or thereabouts).  Well, this is still a
question of reading.  Tom's earlier messages seemed to me to indicate that
the review and letter made the whole of Adorno's work trivial, toadish and
self-aggrandizing.  I would still maintain that this is a refusal to read;
surely what we need to do is to look at A.'s work in the context of the
review and letter (accepting the Arendt line, for the present).  How then
does such 'englobing' play its part in the more interesting questions we
might ask about Adorno's work (his position on reason and enlightment, on
mass culture and modernism, on capitalism and identity AND on fascism and
poetry after Auschwitz)?

(btw. I don't agree that A. on mass culture is almost indistinguishable
from Allan Bloom...but I've already written much more than I intended).

"Because the Woman Poet category is trivializing":  Okay, but maybe in the
early 80s. . . . no, never mind that. . . . i guess my point is that LN
can be usefully read, especially in her "domestic" poems, as putting forth
a distinctly woman's view of the world, of men, of women . . . .

I see your point and agree with you, but isn't also true that Corman placed
her among all poets first and only then among women poets second.

In regards to Cid Corman's remarks about Niedecker:

I was at the Naropa Institute for "Cid Corman" week in '95, and Corman
made many, many comments regarding white male poets from the 40's to the
present, yet had to be prodded to even mention women poets of any
ethnicity.  When he did, he only mentioned Levertov and Niedecker, and
then with a degree of condescension and ghettoization.

Can't we recognize his contributions to publishing at the same time we
acknowledge his uncomfortable (at least) views regarding gender and
race?

This is Kevin Killian.  I interviewed Corman several years back about his
meetings with Jack Spicer, and I must say he went out of his way to talk
about his (contemporaneous) encounters with the poets Joanne Kyger and
Lenore Kandel.  He was talking about 1960, fairly early date to begin an
appreciation of these two (still terribly underrated) writers.  But I agree
with Judy, those comments on the "Granite Pail" book are true space
oddities!!  Thanks--KK.

Would it have been better if Corman had just edited some guy's book of
poems rather than LN's?

While we are talking about how much of a dork he was for the blurbs, why
dont we also suggest that it was a better world after the publication of
the book than it was before it?

My edition doesn't have this text. It's a North Point book. There's
a picture of her standing in snow. On the inside flap we do have a few
men, notably Basil Bunting, using the "p" word. I suppose there's only
one way to respond to gender being raised when "rating her status" among
twentieth century poets; with a poem!

Anyone who thinks this is gender-specific writing isn't reading the
words:

Statement of the International Women's Conference on APEC
Shalom Center, Manila, Philippines, 15-16 November 1996


ASIA-PACIFIC WOMEN REJECT APEC AND CALL FOR A PEOPLE-TO-PEOPLE COOPERATION


We, the women of Asia and the Pacific Rim, reject APEC because the free
trade policies it promotes blatantly lead to the violation of people's human
rights, loss of democracy and social justice, environmental degradation and
increased impoverishment of peoples.

In the name of trade liberalization, our governments have put the interests
of transnational corporations (TNCs) and international financial
institutions at the expense of the interests of people. Economic growth has
created more inequalities within the countries, and between countries, as a
result of profit-oriented and investment-led policies. Corporations have
pursued cheap labor within the region and the use of unfree migrant labor
has increased dramatically. This pattern of economic growth is unsustainable
and has left environmental devastation in its wake.

APEC will only exacerbate this situation and cause the further
marginalization of peoples, particularly women and children.

The indiscriminate opening up of the economy will heighten unfair
competition, benefit only those who monopolize capital and technology,
marginalize the poor and accelerate the depletion of natural resources.

As a result of trade liberalization, we see large-scale, capital intensive
agroculture, monocropping and changing land use patterns. This has tightened
monopoly control of transnational corporations and their practices of double
standards which in turn have caused the people's loss of control over basic
resources such as land, seed and plant varieties, and fuel.

Through these trade policies, developing countries are obligated to allow
the unrestricted importation of subsidized and cheap food products and
thereby discouraging domestic food production and continue to be subjected
to impositions regarding tariff reduction on the small countries.

This has discouraged massive and rapid conversion of agricultural lands
devoted or suitable to food production to non-agricultural or non-food
production uses.

As a result, we are faced by food insecurity and deleterious changing
patterns of food consumption among our peoples.

Contrary to the general notion that trade liberalization and competition
will open more factories, and create more jobs, we are now looking at
massive unemployment and underemployment especially among women and the
increased exploitation in the informal sector.

Massive displacements because of land conversion and development aggression
continue to force our people to migrate to urban centers or to other
countries. Massive homelessness and migration have destroyed communities and
families, destroying the skills and knowledge base of peoples.

In every country, women are the poorest of the poor. Women are carrying the
brunt of free trade policies which have had a devastating impact on women's
rights. The loss of livelihoods and decreasing control over resources are
inccreasing women's marginalization.

Unemployment and underemployment of women are forcing many of them into
prostitution, even as the horrendous poverty of women and their families has
led to an explosion in the trafficking in and sexual slavery of women. As
migrant workers, women's exploitation has been further intensified as
receiving countries have refused to protect their rights as workers making
them vulnerable to sexual harassment and increased exploitation. In the name
of so-called free markets, governments have destroyed social programs which
protect women.

Not one of the governments that are part of APEC have a mandate from their
peoples to negotiate anything.

Free trade is bringing about an erosion of democratic rights and the
destruction of democratic institutions as governments are becoming more
authoritarian and dictatorial. New forms of human rights violations are
emerging, and the women of this region unequivocally condemn this agenda.

We call upon our governments to:

1. Ensure women's full participation in policy formulation and
decision-making processes.
2. Regulate and control TNCs and international financial institutions (IFIs).
3. Live up to commitments made in the UN conventions, including the following:
        -Convention on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women
        -International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights
        -Beijing Platform for Action
        -International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrants
Workers and Members of Their Families
        -International Labor Organization (ILO) Conventions on Labor Standards
        -International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights
        -Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment
or Punishment
        -International Convention on All Forms of Racial Discrimination
        -International Convention on the Suppression and Punishment of the Crime of
Apartheid
        -Convention on the Rights of the Child.

4. Allocate resources for the basic needs of people, such as health care,
education, housing and social assistance, especially for women and children
and all disadvantaged persons.
5. Promote regional cooperation based on promoting self-sufficiency,
capacity building through technology transfer, information flow and special
courses.
6. Stop demolitions, ensure proper relocation in cases where it cannot be
avoided and generate more jobs for urban poor dwellers.
7. Recognize women's role and contributions in safeguarding the environment,
including the conservation of local plant varieties.
8. Provide adequate employment locally with decent living wages to
discourage labor outmigration. Governments of receiving countries should
provide crisis centers for migrant workers.
9. Make food security a priority, ensuring the food needs of peoples and
immediately stop the dumping of cheap food that is detrimental to local food
production.
10. Subsidize and suppport efforts for sustainable agriculture, stop land
conversion and enact or implement land use laws, and provide suppport
services to small farmers,  particularly women  farmers. Furthermore, ensure
fair prices for farmers' produce.

Henceforth, we call upon NGOs and people's movements to:

1. Develop people's alternative structures of fair trade.
2. Undertake campaigns to raise awareness, and to mobilize and organize
peoples movements against APEC.
3. Initiate and strengthen links between and among women, indigenous and
aboriginal peoples, trade unions and migrant workers organizations.
4. Respond to urgent alert actions for migrant women and women workers and
victims of human rights violations.
5. Make the struggle for women's equality a priority agenda.
6. Call upon trade unions to include organizations of workers in the
informal sector.
7. Hold the TNCs accountable for the social and environmental impact of
their operations.

We call on all governments, peoples' organizations, non-government
organizations to unite in resisting and rejecting APEC.

LION is Chadwyck-Healey's attempt at a MASSIVE database in
literature. (Up to the 20th century that is.) It includes English and
American Poetry, African-American Literature, much more. Anyway, you
should read about it by visiting their web page. It's potentially an
important research/teaching resource for some folks. It's the EPC

Subject:      Re: computers, academies, slavery

Hi Mark.  thanks for asking about my job.  my title is tools manager.  I
enable sales professionals & proposal writers to sell computer outsourcing
services to large corporations.  I program & maintain a database of company
information.  of sorts I am a publisher.

I am a reluctant to use the word slave to describe myself.  people do not
inspect my teeth at job interviews.  what they do inspect however may be just
as heinous.

Mark you teach.  i imagine my job to be less "free" than yours (but i don't
know what your title is).  you also have a utopian element that you can claim
i.e. blowing up the normative brain.

& i think you are right when you say that artists not in the academe have a
tendency to think they have made better economic choices because then they
think they can call themselves real artists.  we're not academic artists!  we
do!  we do not teach! we generate/demonstrate a body of knowledge "about" the
world: physics & biology.  (you can define about any way you like.)

real critics are supposed to generate/demonstrate a body of knowledge about
canonical texts categorized in certain time periods and/or geographical
locations and/or identity plates.

real critics use a different energy/brain wave to generate their work than
real artists.

real artists don't need to look at art or writing to generate their work.
 real critics do.  real artists see themselves out ahead of real critics.

then there is the artist critic, like yourself.  you must flip back & forth
between these modes if you want to get paid.  when you are doing art you feel
guilty for not doing enough critical work.   when you are doing critical work
you feel guilty for not doing enough art.  this flipping has caused some
artist/critics to make bad art.  grad school & tenure have been known to kill
the creativity of not a few good artists (not to mention good critics).
 however, this says nothing about what can be done.

i think i used the phrase "clearer, not better" in your presence to describe
the econmic reality of real artists.  that is, clearer in relation to
artist/critics, but not better.  I said this in response to your remark about
working as a journalist and how you had to lie so much.  what i thought was
implicit in your statement and what I objected to was that, now that you were
no longer a journalist, but a teacher, you didn't have to lie, or at least
didn't have to lie as much.  I may agree with the last clause and secretly i
will tell you that flipping and cloudniess have always been more appealing
concepts to me than clarity & I love the opportunies I get at my corporate
job to teach writing, even if it is sales rhetoric.  actually, sales rhetoric
is metaphorically based on seduction, so it has its moments.

the clarity of the real artist causes a loss of dignity if corporate.   the
real artist must schelp & stay put, doesn't have free time to go to
gatherings, doesn't have summers off like most academes.

the real artist may have more flexibility in terms of where to live.

but I belive these things all balance out, you do what you have to do, you
either make good art or bad art and it really doesn't depend much on your
job.  I assume that this little note has excluded those poeple who do not
have to work.  I wonder how many trust fund babies would like to talk about
their experiences?  Or put another way:  do you make better art if you don't
have to work?  or are on unemployment, etc.  I mean I am annoyed at the
present age when compared to the myth of artists in the 60s who could
supposedly survive without permanent corporate or academic employment.  For
example, when you hear people talk about Bolinas.  Then also I have left out
the working class, for example Robert Kocik, who works in wood.

Subject: computers, academies, slavery

I've noticed that with all this recent discussion of poets who work in the
academy analyzing the academy, and poets who work in the computer field
analyzing the academy, that these same poets haven't been discussing the
computer industry.

So--Tom, Ron (Bill Luoma maybe too, right?), a question for you. While in
many instances I agree with your critique of the academy (I know a slave
when I am one), there's seems to be in your posts the suggestion that your
own choices regarding economic matters and survival have been better ones.
So, tell us about the computer industry. You're not slaves there, I take
it? Or at least not slaves to the same degree? I'd be curious to know how
your own industry affects your creative life. Why is that choice working
for you, if it is? We're NOT talking about the difference between slaves
and slave owners, right? Is opportunity there, where you are? For whom?

Please excuse the inability of this modem to "correct" "errors."

Reading this thread, I keep thinking of how angry Elizabeth Bishop would
be when reports on her readings would say that she looked just like
somebody's grandmother -- and how this just didn't happen to her male
contemporaries -- we might compare Whitman to Father Time, but never to
gramps.

For me, the issue is, okay, LN is one the finest poets writing.  Why not
just leave it at that?  Surely that's enough praise.  But maybe part of
the agenda here is that there can only be one "female" at a time.  She's
one of the finest, of which there's only one gal.  So I see and share in
what led to Judy Roitman's original post.  I've just been reading reviews
in the 60s and 70s that do the exact same thing -- complete with ample
deployment of the adjective "domestic," which is, let's face it,
completely useless and often wrong.  Have you ever seen a blurb read:
"One of the best male poets writing today"?  That's a book I'd love to
see.

yeah, i too can most def. see judy's beef relative to those neidecker blurbs...

i was wondering:  i blurbed a book recently, the first full-length history
of computers & writing, and called specific attention to the fact that this
book (authored by two women and two men) made it clear that women's roles
have been vital to this techno-laced field...  my purpose was clearly not
to delimit my positive appraisal of the book, but to use the opportunity to
point to a particular gendering where i thought it might do some good... i
recall trying like hell when i wrote that blurb not to sound condescending,
but i suppose somebody might still find my observation so...

Graduate Student Caucus Motions and Resolution submitted to MLA

I posted this here about a week ago, and it went without comment. I'm
hopeful that that means it was generally read, and perhaps approved of and
filed away for future reference. But in case it was overlooked -- and this
was also while the listserv was hicupping -- I'm reposting apropos of recent
discussion by Joe, David, and others. These actions by the Graduate Student
Caucus account for nearly half of the MLA Delegate Assembly's agenda at the
upcoming convention. They're certainly only the beginning of what needs to
be done, but the resolution in particular represents an attempt to move MLA
in the activist direction also called for by C. Nelson in his _Profession_
piece.

Please consider attending the Delegate Assembly meetings (sessions 178 and
432) and feel free to forward as appropriate. Those who'd like more
information about the GSC may contact me or its current President, Marc
Bousquet <mbousque@email.gc.cuny.edu>.

Apologies to those here for whom these matters are not especially relevant.

I don't own the '85 edition of Granite Pail, but I do own the 1969
Jargon Press edition of T&G (The Collected Poems...) where the second
of those blurbs occurs, penned in fact by Jonathon Williams, the
publisher. In that edition at least, the paragraph begins "Lorine
Niedecker is the most absolute poetess since Emily Dickenson."

Well, there are ways in which the 1960s are remarkably a long time ago,
right?

Williams, it's worth noting, was one of the first poets (and especially
first southern poets) to be aggressively and politically out of the
closet. But there is a certain plantation tone to his anglophilia and
it creeps into other discourses, as here.

By the bye, if the younger folks on this list haven't read Williams
work, the early books in particular are totally worth reading in their
own right. I recall not "getting" the work of Clark Coolidge until
Barrett Watten noted the sense of humor in it, which BW saw as the
influence jointly of Whalen and Williams. And it's true.

Subject:      Re: Adorno and Mandel

It would seem difficult to reply effectively (though Jeremy Green had
done very well indeed) to Tom Mandel's posts re: T.Adorno, not because
there are not useful things to say but because Mandel wants to cut the
ground out from beneath any reaction but his own: *I don't, either,
want to be drawn into a debate on the subject or related subjects or on
Adorno's work. I don't have anything useful to say about it.* Nor am I
sure that gaining tenure on whatever planet means that a person can opt
out of taking responsibility for one's statements and beliefs. One may,
as Mandel points out, believe whatever one wishes; once that belief is
shared with others in a forum such as this there is an implied
expectation that the belief has some relevence and can be backed up.

Mandel takes care to point out that his attack is not directed at the
work; it is Adorno himself, his life, that is at issue (though he
allows himself the luxury of crossing that line by dismissing what he
has read by Adorno as *monumentally self-aggrandizing*). This is
disingenuous at best. It is very doubtful that anyone would be
discussing Adorno, Heidegger or Arendt for that matter were it not for
their written works. Whether or not Adorno was a *toad* is, as Mandel
notes, most likely a matter of personal opinion; Adorno's place in the
critical thought of the 20th century is far more complex.

Susan Buck-Morss treated the Adorno character issue in her book, The
Origin of Negative Dialectics (published in 1977). Her treatment is
more circumspect though more adequately documented (perhaps she did not
yet have tenure on one of the available planets). She quotes from an
Oct 7, 1934 letter where Adorno wrote (he had left Germany in the
Spring of the same year) that he *was trying to stay in Germany at all
costs...* and that if he had been able to stay in Germany he *would
have had no political objection...* (These are quotes from the letter.)

There is no doubt that Adorno's position here is foolish and wrong.
Blinded by his hopes for his own advancement and by an exadggerated
sense of his own abilities, accomplishments and self-importance, he
minimizes the dangers both he himself and others were facing at the
time. Some of this he justifies by a misplaced hope that Hitler would
fall from power before more harm was done.

He was wrong.

He was wrong and he went on to write brilliantly of modern culture.

Granted, intelligence on paper is not a guarantee of intelligence in
life; I doubt that any of us would care for a detailed chart of
correspondence to be drawn up between the two for our own lives. All
criticism, as has been said many times before, may be autobiography; it
is seldom, however, intended as autobiography. Adorno may not have
addressed in his writing what was most shameful in his own life, but he
did, quite consistently, address what he believed to be most important
to that life and to ours.

Tom Mandel's pain is evident in his posts and it is clear that he
believes it is important to remember who we are and where we have come
from. So do I but at the risk of sounding a bit churlish, I feel there
is a larger issue here than Tom's pain: if Adorno has written himself
into a room I believe that would be a very big room, on the order,
perhaps, of a good chunk of the world we inhabit. I, for one,
appreciate and am grateful for Adorno's unflinching, admittedly
mandarin, descriptions of that world in Dialectic of Enlightenment,
Negative Dialectics and the essays in Prisms. I have owned and operated
a record store in Denver CO for over eighteen years and feel that
Adorno's writing on music, most esp in the Philosophy of Music, speaks
powerfully and cogently to the complex relations between aesthetics and
the social and cultural reproduction of experience (& this would
include his remarks on jazz -- but more of that in another post).

This is already too long and may try your patience. I would, in
closing, urge people to read Adorno for themselves. What he has to say
is vital, living and important. Tom Mandel may believe that while
reading someone we should be prepared to pick them out of a line-up and
look over their rap sheet but words are not that easy to jail.

Once, some years ago, Allen Ginsberg said that Victor Coleman and i were
the best two heterosexual poets in Canada. I was pleased. I dont mind being
called one of the best of anything.

Dear Stephen Vincent:

  Yours is a very interesting letter indeed (and I'm appending it as a
reminder for those who, like me, have e-mail-overload-amnesia). What I had
in mind in saying that male writers as a rule ignored the work of younger
(feminist?) women's writing,  was the simple fact you allude to of various
male-dominated poetry groups with their house-woman token member, eg the NY
School or the (amorphous, nowadays) Beats for sure but not uniquely. Various
male poets were quick to review and/or take under their wing young and more
or less unknown men poets, but paid no attention to women writers at all.
Rattle off the names of any and all of the established male writers / poets
/ critics of the sixties and seventies, and their silence when faced with --
well, with Niedecker, let alone Judy Grahn -- is predictably deafening. My
sense is still that Oppen was to all intents and purposes the ONLY white
male writer *of his generation*  to heed writing by younger women. That the
Bay Area was extremely active is true, yes, and I'm sorry if my quick
shorthand summary (and my talk) is misleading. Oppen's interest dates from
his residence in Brooklyn, however,in 1960 or so (this is diffciult to
establish, since there is (necessarily) not much information for the years
1960-1962 in the Letters (he was, clearly, reading Levertov then; but who
else, I wonder). He's reading Naomi Replanski (not, perhaps, to be classed
as a younger poet then, but who else is reading her at that time? or even
now? and she's a really interesting writer) in 1958; DuPlessis in 1965, and
so on. I guess if we want to discuss this further we should go backchannel.

  My essential point, I think, still holds, but of course, as for my
ignorance, mea culpa..

  Which means, yes, I was wrong; and I'm really pleased to be corrected.
Guilty of oversimplification and thus injustice (if that's at issue), I do
indeed know of Momo's Press, in that I've used one of its publications
(Dahlen's A Reading 1-7) in poetry courses, but knew NOTHING about the
press, assumed it was and still is run by women -- (but any mail I sent
there was returned by the post office as undeliverable. So your letter is
useful and fills in a much-to-be-filled-in gap.

   This is especially so regarding _Shocks_ which I'd never heard of -- I am
now trying to get hold of copies -- difficult in Vancouver (NO copies in any
library here that I can find), and of course Canadian funds being what they
are, no library is likely to buy any copies anyway.

  Thanks.

Peter

        Re Cid Corman and Lorine Niedecker:

        when Jenny Penberthy was here last June to give the first annual
LN lecture at woodland Pattern--Penberthy played the one tape known to
exist of LN reading--made by Cid Corman while on a visit with LN.
        (Penberthy pointed out that after LN's trip to NYC in the
Thirties--writers came to Wisconsin to visit LN--)
        I don't think that Corman's living in Japan--as hinted at by some
on this list--affected his judgement re LN--after all--he came from Japan
to visit her . . .(Henry Miller used to point out the American fear that
expatriates' minds had somehow become obscured or lost the sense of true
judgement they'd have had if they'd only stayed at home . . .
        but blurbs seem to exist, when not bland and empty rhetoric, in a zone
of their own and to
disturb in some way--i'm still pissed at the blurbist for a record jacket
who stated that The Standells were a Boston band! And not only that--but
the greatest sixties Punk Band from that city . . ."I Love that dirty
water" indeed . . .

Yes, this is charming.  But I think the charm is in the novelty of it,
the reverse-jolt of the category which we don't expect, necessarily, and,
of course, the source.  What the original post triggered for me is how
remarkably expected the woman poet category/position is for some people.
'taint the same, but I do get a kick out of it -- thanks.  Now for "best
male"?  Anyone?

Let me second, vociferously, Ron's comments on Jonathan Williams -- he is
(lie zillions of others) one of the most neglected national and even
international treasures -- his prose as well as his poetry, his
archeological works of retrieval as well as his energetic promotion of folk
art. And of course his astonishing record as a publisher over the decades.
At times he's too whimsical, at times too curmudgeonly perhaps, but a poet
of great wit and amazing range -- a sharp eye and ear. And not just the
earliest books.

He's also, like so many others on this list, having difficulties finding a
publisher for his work.

MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: Text/Plain; Charset=US-ASCII

The name change: I'm pretty sure the review was published under
Wiesengrund (which, btw, I don't identify as a common Jewish name --
any help on this?), under Wiesengrund-Adorno, that is.

The name change coming in 1938 by no means eliminates the possible
intention of burying a Jewish past (or, indeed, it may be a German past
which the change wishes to obscure!)

"Tom's earlier messages seemed to me to indicate that the review and
letter made the whole of Adorno's work trivial, toadish and
self-aggrandizing."

Can't argue with "seemed to me" but that was not my intention. Adorno
is a problem and not a "trivial" one. The epithet "toad" was meant as
the insult it is but not as a reference to any characteristic of the
work. "Self-aggrandizing" -- now that is an interesting question,
especially given Adorno's pessimism about reason, indeed his general
pessimism. It would be interesting to discuss the possible relationship
between these two. How can someone deeply pessimistic (and I don't
think it is necessary to challenge this in his work: i.e. I don't see
it as a guise or ruse or even an embedded sub-textual narrative device)
also write in a way that so evidently displays his virtuosity and so
evidently drives to a "right" position that is to be identified totally
with the author?

To me pessimism becomes interesting in people and their writings where
it is poised against a countering optimism. Kafka is an emblematic
example of this kind of writer, and one could name others too. Indeed,
Benjamin is a wonderful example as well.

(I'm writing quickly here, btw, as I have a full day ahead of me and
must leave for a meeting in a few minutes: the terms "pessimism" and
"optimism" are markers in this post for a range of qualities of writing
and thought -- a Virgilian sadness of things, a musical joy, black
humor, and much more I don't have time - and probably don't need - to
unpack here.)

As to an unalloyed pessimism, and this is mere hypothesis, at what
point does it, or even must it (must it?), blend into cynicism? What
replaces the value you find it hard to see in reason or in life?

Adorno and his work, far from trivial, might offer a locus for thinking
about these issues.

Above all, I think, it might be fascinating to compare Adorno with a
figure like Lukacs, who bent his view and expressions and work to meet
the needs and strictures of political history. Yet, when we look at his
work in retrospect, there is an integrity to it and a constant
obsession with a set of themes that seem deeply central in European
history. His adaptability in other words now appears to be a way of
cleaving to the essential. Just some thoughts in anticipation of yours.

Sorry Kathrine (and whoever it was who posted some of LN's poems to
demonstrate how universal her work is and not necessarily gender-
specific--my apologies for forgetting who it was at this moment),
but whatever else LN has done (yes, those poems could have been written
by either man or woman, do resonate with either man or woman), she
has given us a singular and important view of a woman in a marriage in
a particular time and place and socio-economic status.  There is, I
guess, more than one Niedecker.  Now, that is just not true; there was
only one Niedecker, but of course we can talk about different strands
of her work.  I hasten to say that the so-called by me "domestic"
strand was not one shared by either Sappho of Lady Murasaki, to my knowledge,
but then again the blurbist for Granite Pail had another strand in mind.
I don't mean here to dispute you, Kathrine, or Judy; what you have both
said is true.  On the other hand, I would hope that you both are not
precluding other important aspects of LN's work.
Who would compare with the "domestic" LN?  Dickinson?--No way. Moore,
HD, Bishop, Howe, Hejinian? I don't think so.

i hardly think it is fair to paraphrase tom mandel thusly:

"Tom Mandel may believe that while
reading someone we should be prepared to pick them out of a line-up and
look over their rap sheet but words are not that easy to jail."

his post never implied one ought to "jail" adorno's words, nor that one
should pick him out of a line-up, whatever that is meant to say.

adorno wrote SPECIFICALLY ABOUT the holocaust, taking on an "i am a
victim" pose, wrote attacking nazis from a righteous, my-hands-are-
not-dirty" posture, wrote, again from my-hands-are-not-dirty, self-
righteous, victimized posture about corrupt power.

what tom mandel points out, and rightfully so, is a terrible crack in
this posture: adorno WAS a victimizer, he WAS a nazi and supported them,
he turned against other jews, and he was extremely corrupt in his own
use of power, or so mandel's examples (if they are backed up.  i am not
a great follower of adorno's work) make quite clear.  this is horrifying
from a personal point of view, interesting from an analytical,
de-constructionist/sociological point of view.  it is also an insult to
to the victims.

mandel has NOT said, anywhere, that adorno's works should in any way be
banned, hidden away, or otherwise "jailed."

the following announcement to the list. I read it and didn't see why not,
so here it is.

The URL is http://www.cais.net/aesir/fiction but don't be deceived by the
"fiction" part of it. Notice what Mike has to say in his announcement
about poetry. And there's more on his site than he's telling us here. I
really do believe that it's worth checking out, and that the work Mike is
doing will reward the time you spend at Web Del Sol.

I must confess that Mike has been kind to my own work. Web Del Sol
features  links both to Mudlark, the e-journal of poetry & poetics that I
edit, and to Pleasure Boat Studio, which has just published my book, The
Politics of My Heart. But that's not why I spend some of my time there.

Keep in mind that the following announcement is intended for general
release. Mike didn't write it specifically for this list. Do give Web Del
Sol a look. And let Mike hear from you.

I was going through the West while Western movies were a hot topic here, so

I don't want to go over old ground here, but 'cause there was high praise

know there's a forthcoming 2-CD set on John Zorn's Tzadik label, in the

I don't know more about it now, but I'd guess it'll be out later this winter.

MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII

Tom raises a number of very interesting questions in his post.
Constraints of time and (grading-sapped) energy prevent me from taking
them on (even if I had useful comments to hand).  Instead, a couple of
jottings on the question of the works and biography which are tangentially
related to the issue of A.'s politics (and so perhaps to the Lukacs
comparison).

I once asked a convinced "adornoboy" (Stephen Rodefer's coinage in a
recent poem) if there was a biography of Adorno (in German, since there
isn't one in English) and met with a strange response: there would be no
point writing a bio. of Adorno.  After all, he went on, what would it say?
During these years A. worked hard on the critique of phenomenology and the
problem of the intellectual division of labor, etc., etc.?  This didn't
satisfy me at the time and it doesn't now (especially in light of the
Muntzel review and 1966 letter).  The other--no less
unsatisfactory--position would be the one which uses biography to
discredit the writings, the kind of approach practised by the British
historian Paul Johnson in his book _Intellectuals_ (since this book may
not have crossed the Atlantic--I hope not!--I should probably gloss the
reference: Johnson dug up whatever sleaze he could to discredit any writer
whose politics did not coincide with his own [rampant, raging, right-wing,
it hardly needs saying]--thus, Brecht conducted multiple affairs and so is
not worth reading; the general aim was to discredit the category of
intellectual, I suppose).

As far as Adorno goes, one might ask why he was so determined to remain in
Germany, even if it meant ingratiating himself with the Nazis.  Part of
it, no doubt, has to do with biographical contingency (the fact that he
couldn't seem to establish himself in Oxford, where he was spending part
of the time as one of Gilbert Ryle's 'advanced students' [!], and the fact
that his fiancee Gretel Karplus was still living in Berlin--and no doubt
more along the same lines); but part of it surely also has to do with his
conception of politics and his faith in the overriding importance of
European culture. The strategy of 'hibernation' sound uncomfortably like
his conception of politics in his later philosophy, where--very
roughly--the work of art becomes the repository for the utopian glimmers
extinguished from praxis.

Pessimism?  Yes, certainly.  Does he identify himself with the "right
position"?  I guess the defence here might be that his texts dialectically
refuse the 'philosophical' standpoint (part of the burden of the essay on
Beckett's _Endgame_, perhaps), and this is where the modernist artwork
steps in, embodying what it is beyond the power of philosophical discourse
to state.  Those moments where the pessimism seems peculiarly the promise
of redemption (like the last section in _Minima Moralia_) do resonate with
Benjamin in significant ways.

I'd better stop now--all systems flagging (but not before wierd Adorno
fact of the day: A. once wrote an opera based on _Tom Sawyer_....could
there be more of a mismatch?)

Good night all

Let me endorse the two poetas recently mentioned here:

        Jonathan Williams  whose _Blues & Roots/Rue & Bluets_, _The Loco
Logodaedalist in Situ_, and _Mahler_  ((& maybe one can still come
across his Selected _An Ear in Bartrams' Tree_ in  second-hand shops))
taught me -- "by ear/ he said" as Olson has it but though the latter
doesn't necessarily do as well as Colonel Williams and Blackburn with
that specific organ --  much about American poetry when I first came
over here. Just as neglected and invisible is his companion, the poet
Thomas Meyer who has one of the finest lyric voices of my generation.
BTW, if it hadn't been for those two Americans & their summer hangout in
the Yorkshire dales, Basil Bunting's last years would have been much
less pleasant & the general stock of singlemalt scotch much higher in
that region.

        & Henri Chopin is indeed one of the pioneers & masters of sound poetry.
His OU magazine & books are wworth snapping up whenever you come across
them. But of course, catch him in performance: nothing human is strange
for that man, his body & his mike.

        BTW, West Coasters -- & thinking more especially of Kevin & Dodie in SF
-- did any of you get to the Centennial of the First Public Performance
of UBU ROI held in Justin Herman Plaza, Embarcadero, San Francisco
Sunday, 8 December 1996. Some of us Ubuistas would love to hear.

Let's say for a moment there were a culture with two major mythical
figures representing materialism. Both were easily recognizable because
they wore red suits--not a common color for suits in that time and place.
Both were associated with fire and fire-sources, and were frequently
pictured wreathed in second-hand smoke. Both were described as excessively
preoccupied with tallying good and evil deeds. One carried a pitchfork,
one a whip, and get this, THE NAME OF EACH WAS AN ANAGRAM OF THE OTHER!
     I'm thinking of calling for a congressional investigation and the
appointment of a special prosecutor. Any seconds?

I don't think you could write about Adorno and the holocaust without
making the point that, for A., the holocaust was, in some sense, the
ultimate goal of Western rationalism. Of course, A. certainly considered
himself deeply implicated in the traditions of high metaphysics and would
thus be deeply implicated in Nazism. A little too nuanced, certainly,
for many when confronted with more concrete evidence of culpability,
but I don't think that anyone with even a passing familiarity of A.
would argue that A. consideredhimself either victim or victimizer.
Thanks,  Eric.

At 07:29 PM 12/16/96 -0500, various people's contributions ended up giving us:
(Sorry in advance for the considerable length!)

>he turned against other jews, and he was extremely corrupt in his own
>use of power, ....

        A little later in the discussion the response comes back: Adorno was
not a Nazi. (Indeed, not!) I think some of this extremist rhetoric (calling
A. a nazi) comes ultimately from the premise of the thread, which assumes
that Adorno must be looked at as a sort of fixed entity. As though he were
either pro-Nazi or a victim: not both. Not sometimes one, sometimes another.
It seems like Tom Mandel is speaking out against such a decisive and
unrealistic dichotomy when he writes:

>There are no "works" that are not also "persons."

        Because this strikes me as remarkably similar to a premise Adorno
(though I confess I haven't read much A. besides _Minima Moralia_ and
_Dialectic o. t. Enlightenment_) more or less assumes, and that  Benjamin
and Brecht hold as integral to their critical work. You could almost say, I
think, that one of Benjamin's major contributions to contemporary theory was
that he reminds us (me at least) that "persons" rather than words, rather
than concepts such as history, such as Marxism, are (or should be) the orgin
and the end point of "works." Brecht also. And Bakhtin. They offered new
"revolutionary" ways of expressing this point. They fought against strict
structuralism and formalism, etc. while finding ways to at the same time to
also avoid the paradigms those methods avoided.

        T.M. goes on to say:

>It is what Adorno did
>that we or someone should discuss -- not some 2d-order abstraction like
>what it "means" or its "place" in his work, but What He Did. And we
>should remember that this refers to 1934 and to 1964, to both.

        And it still appears that he is insisting that Adorno either be
accepted (as a victim - ?) or condemned as "extremely corrupt in his own use
of power," (in someone else's words.) How is he not both? How are we doing
justice to any of these topics (Adorno, his "works", the holocaust even) if
we do no allow ourselves to imagine that Adorno writing in 1934 was perhaps
scared and willing to say what was necessary? He didn't know the future. And
perhaps the situation of 1934 informed his response 30 years later. He still
didn't know his future. They are two entirely different claims to say a)
that Adorno abused the authority of his "adopted" victimization because he
was not genuinely a suffering saint or b), as I am suggesting, that he was
perhaps terrified on the one hand, perhaps arrogant, ashamed on the other.

        As I'm sure the above is dashed off too to make much sense: the
dichotomy that has developed appears to be the result of removing
unpredictable HUMAN motivation and action from the writings: and a
reassertion of the fact that nothing written comes purely from history or
from circumstace but also from _undeterminable_ humanity is integral to
Adorno, Benjamin, Brecht. Because this humanity, unlike history, social
circumstances, etc., is not empiricialy quantifiable, it is, IMO, far too
often left out of the equation (exactly _because_ the equation model is a
desired endpoint). In all the above theorists, as also in the theories of
their late contemporary, Bakhtin, the insertion of this ungovernable,
unknowable human element is usually swept behind various critical curtains
with a shrug of the shoulders and the label "mysticism" or "religious".
(I've often heard it say, for example, that Benjamin is great, but
"mystical", or that Adorno or Bakhtin were fine Marxist critics but could
somehow never shake that "religious edge" they peskily maintained.)
        I do not, of course, mean to say that such questions as Adorno's
lacking recantation are not interesting, important, what have you. But they
should not be used as markers of much broader judgements without the
essentially unknowable quality of their orgins being pointed out every now
and again.

        Sorry for such ridiculous length.
        (Not much doing (for once) at work today.)

        best,

Many thanks to Ward for the info on Chopin. Such info is much
appreciated!  I've not found it easy to track down such recordings.

Along these lines, I might ask if anyone out there knows where I can
get a copy of the CD of Futurist/etc. work. It was an anthology of
some sort. Someone told me recently they just got it at a record store
but I can't find any trace of it. Any ideas?

Feel free to backchannel me if that's more appropriate...

It was neither Kathrine nor Judy who posted the LN poem (not "poems")
to the list. The poem was Lake Superior. How well do you really know
Neidecker? And how well do you know Sappho. She was a mother, too!
This so-called "domestic" thread; have you sought it in a male poet?
Care to back up your socio-economic statement with an example or two?

I posted the poem, and I doubt there are many better poems written by anyone
in this century. Let Lorine speak. Prove your theory with examples.

Did Jonathan Williams write a book of prose called "Something Else" or
something like that?  I recall seeing a copy in my hometown used
bookstore -- it looked interesting, but I had other priorities last time
I was there -- and could pick it up over Christmas.  Recommended?

Subject:      lesson plan/ sales pitch

Hey Bill Wallace and Mark Luoma--I like binaries too--especially when someone
else sets the terms so I can mix them up (kinda like the normative brain)---
B says, "sales rhetoric is metaphorically based on seduction, so it has its
moments"---but too often in this land of money (where i come from feeling is
a crime...) it seems that seduction is BASED ON sales rhetoric....
anyway that's not what i am here to say.....
    REAL CRITICS VS. REAL CHEESE....
  and then those of "us" who are "torn between" the two
  (like the Thracian singer by the tipsy bachannals)
   feel guilty when writing one for not writing the other....
   well that's like saying i feel guilty when i'm suicidal for
    not being happy (and i may but that usually doesn't help)
    or, on a lighter note, feeling guilty when i'm happy for
    not being suicidal (don't know why i think it's a shame when
    i get feeling better.). The first option (trying to figure out
    why you're sad just leads to more sadness until something
    she has no control over comes to rescue. A BIG IF) is
    possible. But is the second? (feeling guilty for being happy)
    I don't think so.....
    Anyway, this of course has EVERYTHING to do with the
    academic vs. "real artist" distinction.
    The (I HATE THE WORD HYBRID but what the hell) academic/
    artist may--in trying to participate in several dialogues--
    be a very weird kind of inbalance. Yet probably no more than
    any others (it takes a fast car baby to lead a triple life)
    Like Gender (like realizing you don't like being, say, a male
    and so you ENVY WOMEN and then you try to undo that envy
    by remembering they are human too--or the glass ceiling or something)
    So why do others "BETRAY" the real artist status bill speaks of to join
the academy. I--as you may know--RESISTED for years. But I ultimately felt
claustrophobic (isolated, hollow)
by the "poetry world"---
     Tried the "avant-garde"--they wouldn't publish what I
     thought was my most ambitious work.
     Tried the mainstream--for pretty much the same reason.
IN BOTH A FEELING OF HAVING TO APPEAL TO SOMETHING LIKE
"MUSIC" as one in another field of specialization (politician)
 might appeal to "MODERATES"--
     Wanted to start "my own scene"--like so many others have
     (though they probably won't admit it--for modesty or for
     TQM reasons)--but found no patrons and my friends seemed
     not to feel as strongly claustrophobic, unfulfilled in
     working within the assumptions of any given scene--
     or were able to keep decent paying jobs better than I
    and so could start their own journals, etc.....
     So, I went academic....hoping to be funded but Pataki....
    (i digress). The point I really wanted to make was that
    THE SPECIALIZED DIVISION BETWEEN ACADEMIC AND POETRY
    scenes is something I'm very interested in straddling--
    because I feel I FIT in neither as is--but if I can somehow
    play them off each other (in my mind at least) and simply
    not be disappointed by the lack of intensely verbal engage-
    ment and argument and passion and personality in the poetry
   scene because maybe i can find it among the shakespeareans
    or in grading papers--
     like one of my STUDENTS writing on STEVENS:
     ("Perhaps it is of more value to infuriate philosophers
       than to go along with them," is very true because philo-
       sophers love to argue. They just want to prove their
        point to you as best they can)---
     and so i go back and forth and can be refreshed enough to
     try once again to bang my head against a brick wall I mean
     ignite or be ignited by the poetry scene. This movement
    may eventually allow something i crave and have not yet
    really found (a "soulmate" for instance, or even a playmate..)
    Yours in cloudiness and flipping, Chris

Subject:      Andrew Klobucar's post
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: Text/Plain; Charset=US-ASCII

Andrew Klobucar frames his response to my first post on Adorno's
attempt to ingratiate himself with the Nazis in 1934 by writing a
positive review of a song cycle to a suite of Fascist poems by Baldur
von Shirach and quoting Goebbels approvingly therein as well as his
attempt to excuse this behavior thirty years hence by saying that he
regretted it but it surely did not put him in a class with Heidegger
(and the reader will notice that every time I post on this subject I
repost more or less this same statement -- there's nothing here without
it) by calling attention the "more politically liberal attitude" of
Arendt versus Adorno's "Marxist aesthetics."

Huh?

He continues by approving (with reservations) Adorno's published
critiques of Benjamin, suggesting that the content of these might be
used to oppose my characterization of his bedeviling Benjamin in the
correspondence as "trivial and pettifogging." You will remember that
what I was discussing was the relationship of these two human beings
and not Adorno's "more thoughtful, published statements," as Klobucar
dubs the unrelated (to the issue at hand, though not in subject matter)
writings.

Andrew Klobucar also dubs my mention of the review, etc. as "Mr.
Mandel's allegations" -- but there is no allegation involved. No one
denies the review or Adorno's authorship of it. No one denies its
contents either. Surely (I desperately hope) no one denies the
odiousness of these pieces of behavior.

Yet, AK's phrase may represent nothing more than sloppy language; email
doesn't lend itself to precision of thought in every case. This may
explain as well a statement of this nature:  "...it is generally
accepted among intellectuals today that many of Adorno's "personal"
critiques of Benjamin's more ambitious philosophical interests seem
hastily offered and somewhat immature in their reasoning." The thud of
Mr. K's mind closing this or any case on such evidence made me laugh
out loud reading his post.

Mr. Klobucar "merely stress(es) that one must be cautious before
condemning all of Adorno's critique..." and I suppose that makes sense.
It would make even more sense had I done any such thing! On the other
hand, caution plays a small role in my character, too small a role some
would say. Mr. K is not alone in his opinion, and there is no doubt
the stricture applies in some manner or other.

Finally, "Adorno's insights into the cultural logic of bourgeois
rationalism remain unique in their ability to contextualise some of the
most important and influential developments in western modern
thought....Perhaps, Mandel is not entirely aware that he is, in some
ways, calling into question an entire cultural positioning."

Casting aside the rodomontade and excessive abstraction of the language
("insights [have] ability to contextualise") what seems to be said here
is that Adorno "is" interpreting developments in Western thought (in
Mr. K's mind, the author, like some machine in eternity, continues his
analysis beyond his mortal end); my pointing out that he tried to
ingratiate himself with the Nazis, etc. might conceivably get in the
way of this activity. At this point the laughter cited above slides, as
laughter so often does, into tears. Andrew Klobucar, whatever are you

In what she says about my posts, Eliza McGrand is accurate. In her very
well-put (wonderfully mixed, to my stiff back) metaphor of a "crack" in
Adorno's "posture" she is again acute.

But, little tho I like the man I think it is inaccurate to call him a
Nazi -- and partly I point this out *because* of my distaste for him.
It would be easy enough to turn away this charge. Nor is it exactly
accurate to say that he wrote as a victim; he wrote with a strongly
implied (indeed a taken for granted) sense of solidarity with the
victims of the holocaust. A solidarity he had *not* earned.

What if he had found favor in his attempt to ingratiate himself with
the Nazis? What if (somehow) it had not become known that he was half
Jewish? Might he then have become what EM calls him? The logic of
counterfactual conditionals is notoriously complicated, and it doesn't
get easier when you move from logic to social reality.

I wonder whether people want to know just how many people found it
possible (and just how possible) to collaborate. Nor is there an
inverse relation between this ease and the person's intelligence or
even accomplishments. Heidegger is the obvious case. It is really not
possible to look back at the history of philosophy without in some
measure you are looking straight through his work. He utterly changed,
for an obvious example, how we can see Greek philosophy. Moreover, what
he has to say is immensely interesting too.

Gottfried Benn. In France, Drieu la Rochelle (strongly recommend, on a
different tack, "Le feu follet" -- both the novel and the film by Louis
Malle).

I find it very easy to see nihilism in Adorno's pessimism. I find it
easy to imagine him embosomed in the German thirties -- but, that's
just me, it's just speculation, arguably idle speculation, possibly
empirically disprovable speculation.

What is not speculative is what he did, and how he dealt with it. In
this sense, yes, his review totally discredits his "no poetry after
Auschwitz" epithet.

Another figure useful to compare with Adorno is Blanchot. How does one
deal with that in one's past with which one no longer agrees? That in
one's past which one must reject?

Subject:      Re: Domestic

Isn't this word "domestic" loaded! I suspect - at least within one set of
writing conventions - not to write with any focus on the "domestic" is a
manly thing. He who does not do the dishes, change diapers, do childcare,
clean house, etc.  -- let alone finds it either cute or  a taboo to mention
or take seriously (or even comically) such activity in a poem -- is
considered "manly." This writer is a person out in the public realm
making/writing serious, publically responsible, perhaps "universal"
literature. In this convention, the man, if not tended to at home by a she,
views the interior domestic family life as, at best, quaint, and of no
extended significance.  She, one the other hand , who writes from within this
purely domestic landscape makes a writing, no matter how well made, is making
gender-specific work, or a poetry of secondary significance when compared to
the more universal intentions of work that speaks to and from a public,
definitely "non-domestic" realm. Within this convention, to ever have your
work (whether you are male or female) identified as "domestic" is to be cast
out, or consigned to permanent membership in a lesser cast.

      I suspect this why people go up the wall when Lorine Niedecker - in any
shape or form (blurbs included) - has her work as identified as "domestic."

      I have no problem - as most on this list - saying that she is a great
poet, certainly someone I return to frequently. I don't have difficulty -
when it's actively there - taking great pleasure in her attention to what is
"domestic" - nor do I have that problem with WCW, when he's "at home" as
well.

      What bothers me -- in terms of either the tone of dread or high
mindedness of some of the critical responses to the Granite Pail  "domestic"
(good housewife?) blurbs -- is a willingness to throw the baby out with the
bathwater. I'm not sure why there remains such an aversion to the domestic
world as a vital element, if not a crucial component, to the entire picture.
Perhaps with the exception of families of religious fundamentalists or
families and writers into old domestic parodies, I think the antique writing
convention I have described here is obviously bankrupt and on its way out.
  The contemporary world of domestic space - particularly in ways that it's
been newly gendered and transformed by any number of factors is probably one
of our best microcosims (sp?) and active receptacles for the most pressing
issues in the public realm.  Consequently - and I don't think I'm too alone
on this - I find the domestic realm (such as that it has become) a lively and
significant place from which to make writing.

Subject:      MANDORLA

Greetings to all from Mexico City. With the fifth issue of MANDORLA now at
the printers, I thought I might take this opportunity to offer list members
back issues #2, #3 and #4 at seven dollars per issue. MANDORLA 5 should be
available at the end of January 1998 ($10). Please back-channel with your
orders, or send checks made out to my name and to the address listed below.

The first issue of *MANDORLA: New Writing From the Americas* was published
in May 1991 as an attempt to begin a meaningful dialogue that is
bilingual�multilingual, in fact�but not in the conventional sense of the
word. In English and Spanish translated material appears only in its
surrogate tongue; previously unpublished work is featured only in its
original language; and in the case of poetry in French or Portuguese, the
work appears in its original, with translations into both Spanish and
English. Other voices reading�or re-reading�each other's writing so as to
authorize a body coherent with the intellectual and creative vitality of
the hemisphere.

MANDORLA is edited and printed in Mexico City: a site where the cultural
debate between north and south has begun to occur. In fact, the name of the
magazine�mandorla, describing that space created by two intersecting
circles�alludes to the notion of exchange and the imaginative dialogue that
is an obligation now among the Americas. The terrain to be forged is like
the American continent itself: virtually boundless.

They usually have a copy or two of a Dada/Futurist compilation CD at Wall
of Sound in Seattle.  They've had Henri Chopin discs in the past, as well,
though I don't think I've seen the new one mentioned earlier.


Wall of Sound does have e-mail, but they check it so rarely, you'd be
better off calling them  (206)  441-9880.  Or write them at

2237  2nd Avenue
Seattle, WA  98121

You know, catty-corner from the Speakeasy in Belltown.

The disc I'm thinking of is on the Sub Rosa label.  & if you want to look
around town wherever you are, you'd be better off looking at smaller shops
that have a lot of European "industrial"/"ambient" music, cause that's the
kind of distribution Sub Rosa gets.

Subject:      Ad Vance Bell
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: Text/Plain; Charset=US-ASCII

It has taken me a day or so to find the time to reply to Vance Bell's
words. For one thing, his riposte to my original Adorno post is
lengthy. For another, although it comes with an emblem of authority
(Bell "concentrates his thinking mostly on Adorno and Benjamin") and is
delivered alternately as absolutes ("not a single citation to an
original text") and rhetoricized irrelevancies ("Is this the same
Arendt that [sic] was intimately involved with Heidegger..?) it pretty
aggressively attempts to render nil my reference to Adorno's attempt to
ingratiate himself with the Nazis, his approving quote of Goebbels, his
30 years of silence on his own action, and his attempt to excuse his
behavior once he was confronted with it. Hence, there is no avoiding a
response on my part.

Bell  begins: "First thing I might say is that this indictment has not
a single citation to any original text.... their lack casts a negative
light on the content."

Hmmm. I believe I cited both the review in die Musik and the exchange
of letters in Diskus, and these represent the only "original text"
involved here. We are not off to a good start here.

Mr. Bell quotes my original post: 'In a letter to Karl Jaspers, Hannah
Arendt referred to Adorno as "one of the most repulsive human beings I
know.'" And asks "Is this the same Arendt that was intimately involved
with Heidegger and who was treated rather badly by the same?"

Why yes, Vance, the very same. What is the significance of the
rhetorical question?


To my "Arendt detested Adorno for his attempt to ingratiate himself
with the Nazis," Vance Bell replies: "I think that I would have done
the same thing in A.'s place.... Adorno, was in fact, born to a
Catholic mother and was therefore, technically, not a Jew by Jewish
standards (Nazi standards being obviously quite different)."

I wonder if Mr. Bell is really content to have said that. I wonder
whether the rest of you would like to read those words slowly one more
time.

If, Vance, you do intend those words, then, yes you are right, people
do all kinds of things, and perhaps you would have done the same thing
in Adorno's place. Believe it or not, Vance Bell, this does *not*
excuse him in the slightest.

Between the two sentences I separate with an ellipsis above, Bell says:
"It is all too easy to view the situation in '33-4 with the benefit of
hindsight." Perhaps I missed something Mr. Bell was shown; if not, I'm
pretty sure there is no other way to view 1934 than in hindsight.

Lets get serious here.

It might be interesting for Vance Bell to supply the full list of
Jewish or part-Jewish Marxist or otherwise left-leaning intellectuals
who praised Baldur von Shirach's murderous verse and quoted Goebbels
approvingly in the process - or the equivalent, not to be too exact -
and whose retrospective analyses of National Socialism we are to take
seriously, whose remarks on poetry and Auschwitz, for example, we are
to give the slightest credit.

Perhaps completeness is too stringent a request. Why don't you add ONE
NAME to the list, Mr. Bell. There's a challenge. Who else is on the
list? Add one name to Adorno's.

 When I refer to Arendt's distaste for Adorno's in her words
"indescribably pathetic" attempt to excuse himself when his activities
were discovered thirty years later, Mr. Bell's retorts: "Again I would
like to know more of H.'s (i.e. Hannah Arendt's) relationship to
Heidegger when the latter took over the rectorship of Freiburg Univ."

Wow, I guess Mr. Bell really does identify with Adorno, just as he said
above. As Adorno excused himself with Heidegger (not as bad as
Heidegger) so Vance Bell excuses him -- what of Heidegger and Arendt?
And yet, how does what Heidegger did excuse Adorno?

>From here, Vance Bell turns to the review itself. He quotes me: "In a
periodical called Die Musik in June 1934 Theodor Wiesengrund-Adorno
wrote a music review in which he praised a song cycle written to poems
by Baldur von Schirach - an obscure person today thankfully but
extremely well-known at the time as a Nazi poet and an adorer of
Hitler, to whom the book of poetry was dedicated (to "Adolph Hitler,
the Fuhrer")! from which come the texts of the songs. The song cycle
bears the same name as the book. The editors of the Arendt-Jaspers
correspondence describe it as containing "phrases which even today can
be regarded only as obsequious gestures to the Nazis. Adorno apparently
was not bothered by the fact that some of the poems advocated mass
murder." The review also uses a phrase of Goebbels - approvingly."

On all of this, Vance Bell comments, "Has this person read the original
text?  I bet it is not that long.  Certainly sounds bad, but the
original is necessary for any further conclusions." Yes, Vance, that is
true.

To my "It goes without saying that Adorno took no opportunity after the
war to mention having written this document," Bell replies: "Certainly
Adorno did not forget what he wrote." Huh?

To my claim that his having written this review and quoted Goebbels
approvingly "played no part in any of the judgments he made of German
intellectuals' relations to the Nazis," Bell replies "How can one say
that it did not play a part in the judgments made of German
intellectuals?" Gee, Vance, what I meant was that he didn't out what he
had done as he got busy judging others - seems obvious.

To my pointed irony that Adorno "did not footnote his Minima Moralia
axiom about poetry after Auschwitz with any reference to the poetry he
had praised only a few years before Auschwitz was built," Bell replies:
"It might also be important to note that the German version of MM has
no footnotes, period." Double huh?

"What, he asks, "would be the relation of Adorno's text in Die Muzik be
to the axiom. Wouldn't the axiom itself speak against all of A.'s
poetry criticism prior to MM or Prisms equally to condemn lyric poetry
in general." I'm not *sure* I follow the syntax in Bell's 2d sentence,
but I'm quite sure he hasn't the faintest notion of my point, which is
simple: Adorno's behavior, his smarmy attempt to get in good with the
Nazis by praising the song cycle on Baldur von Shirach's texts, unfits
him entirely to take a moral position on poetry after Auschwitz.

Fast forward (I'm sorry, I know how laborious this is; I'm happy to
think that some of you are not following this thread at all and can
just jettison this post along with the others on the subject, but I
have no choice but to reply point by point to this
defense-attorney-for-Adorno post by Vance Bell), okay sloooow forward
to 1964:

"The January 1964 issue of Diskus, a Frankfurt student newspaper,
contains an open letter to Adorno," I say, "written by a student and
asking whether he was the author of the review in question. Adorno
replies in the same issue (which as I say I have not read). "I deeply
regret having written that review," especially because "it deals with
poems by Schirach" and made use of "a phrase of Goebbels." Obviously,
it is hardto credit "regret" that does not lead to repudiation, and
Adorno had kept his authorship of these words secret for thirty years.
After expressing this regret, according to the editors, he goes on to
make a series of excuses and concludes that it will be left to the
reader "to decide whether those incriminating sentences should be given
any weight in assessing my work and my life.... No one... could
possibly compare me to Heidegger...""

To this, Bell replies: " Not to excuse him... but if this is Adorno's
only infraction it is small compared to both deMan and Heidegger."

The blindness of this is truly amazing. Adorno could not include de Man
of course, but otherwise, Vance Bell simply repeats the excuse Adorno
offered in his own defence! The other guy is guiltier. He is much
guiltier!

If Bell hadn't continued - "I am curious if this author would have
faired so well.?" - I might not have bothered to reply. I must assume
these words apply to me, that I am "this author," but even if they
aren't so intended, they give one a poor impression of Mr. Bell's sense
of ethics. People, for example, steal all the time Mr. Bell. Are you
saying that I'm a thief, or are you just saying everybody is?

"The students of the sixties," Vance Bell concludes (meaning
the German student who confronted Adorno with his review
of thirty years hence), "would have been born at the War's close.
Are we saying that they themselves were also anti-semities, or
Nazis in disguise (gee Tom, aren't *all* Germans)?"

For that last statement, Vance Bell, whose "thinking concentrates on
Adorno and Benjamin" you deserve a spanking; any time you
want to come around and receive the spanking you deserve, feel
free to do so. I'd enjoy delivering it.

Duane Davis makes the good point that the rhetorical device I used
to remove myself from any debate on Adorno=92s work that might
be stimulated by my pointing to evidence of his ill behavior, which
was to say simply that I found him a repellent figure and didn=92t want
to waste my time discussing his work, has not worked. He is quite
correct.

He goes on to characterize that device as a refusal to take =

responsibility for one=92s position. I don=92t see it that way, but I am =

willing to accept a corrective that is so intelligently stated and =

seems so honest. I especially respect the fact that he makes it not =

personally but by referring to a forum of this kind. That in a society =

of peers, Duane seems to say, you will not get away with a shirking of =

such responsibility.

In all, I agree with Duane=92s post. He compares Susan Buck-Morss=92s =

treatment of Adorno=92s character favorably to my treatment of the =

subject, and without knowing the book to which he refers I am sure he =

is correct in calling her more circumspect and better documented. My =

treatment was tangentially documented, and it was not circumspect at =

all.

I have said elsewhere that I consider Adorno a problem. Evidently, =

Duane Davis does too. But, he seems to consider Adorno=92s flaws more =

interesting than I do. Hence he refers to Adorno=92s "exaggerated sense =

of his own abilities, accomplishments and self-importance" but does not =

like my calling him "monumentally self-aggrandizing." Is there any =

difference other than the level of interest?

Had I known of Buck-Morss=92s treatment of this subject (on the =

assumption that is that it covers the review and Diskus exchange), I =

probably would have referred the list to it and let it go at that. I =

simply don=92t find that his work implies as much of the world as Duane =

does. I find it virtuosic, sometimes penetrating, usually stunted.

All the same, Duane makes a cogent and passionate case for Adono: "he =

did... address what he believed to be most important to that life (i.e. =

his) and ours." =


And when I re-read that I think: he praised Baldur von Shirach and =

quoted Goebbels approvingly.

Ethical thought is difficult thought. Sometimes we make ourselves =

pay in some occulted way for what we cannot face in ourselves. Perhaps =

there is a relation between the determined absolutism of reason=92s =

defeat as it is brilliantly unrolled in the works of Theodor Adorno and =

his own willingness to blind himself. On the other hand, perhaps not. I =

cannot help but feel that pathos fits him better than tragedy.

Unless someone has the time to translate the =9234 review and the Diskus =

article, now might be a good moment to abandon this thread.

Hi:

I may be jumping on the wrong train here, but if you are talking about the
collection of Dada and Furturist music/talk/readings - all from the
original guys- it is put out by Sub Rosa, and is distributed by AK Press.

David Kaufman sent me the following email. It contains facts which
reflect very positively on Adorno's relations with Benjamin, pretty
much undercutting the basis of my negative judgment of those relations.
I haven't asked him whether it was ok to forward it to the listserv,
but I assume no problem.

In my reading last night, I came across a passage which for some
strange reason I thought a propos to the ongoing discussion of Adorno:

        Alice was just beginning to think to herself, "Now, what am I
        to do with this creature when I get it home?" when it grunted
        again, so violoently, that she looked down into its face in
        some alarm. This time there could be no mistake about it: it
        was neither more nor less than a pig, and she felt that it
        would be quite absurd for her to carry it any further.

        So she set the little creature down, and felt quite relieved
        to see it trot away quietly into the wood. "If it had grown
        up," she said to herself, "it would have made a dreafully ugly
        child: but it makes a rather handsome pig, I think."

maybe the thirst for truth & reality inhabits a kind of median between the
thirst for knowledge (the academy) & the thirst for experience (the "poetry
scene").  In the "old days" poetry encompassed storytelling, theater,
& lesson plans (before prose, drama, & philosophy).  But the resources of
language are still there, & strong poetry quenches at least 2 of the
thirsts mentioned.

What I'd like to see is a poetry "scene" not artificially divided between
"beats"[sic] & academics, nor balkanized in the fashion of society at large,
& in which an active poetics feeds off a general audience rather than
an academic set of credentials & networks - independent but not alienated
from the kind of learning & attention found in schools.  Perhaps what this
will require (& probably this is not a new idea!!) is a new standard of
poetic style - which aims to integrate prose, storytelling, performance
in a real (or enhancing) way with "lyric". & something that speeds
beyond the stand-up tragicomedy of the current cliques.

An aside: (laugh as you will) I now think Shakespeare was written by
somebody else - maybe a group.  What kind of model does this provide if true?
If Shakey was a stage manager - a front for Anonymous.

Youse sophisticates may laugh as you please & say "this has already been
happening for a long time", but I say well, not in my neighborhood it hasn't.
Prove me wrong.     - Henry Gould, back from London & crazed as ever

well i for one am all for "domestic" spaces, provided we're not treating
them as somehow "less"... there's a new book out on how women in particular
have constructed boundaries (using home technologies) to safeguard such
spaces, by my colleague here at iit, christena nippert-eng, entitled _home
and work_ (u of chicago)... and a piece in the recent zone collection
_incorporations_ bounces all around such spaces:  "hygiene, cuisine, and
the product world of early twentieth-century america," by ellen lupton and
j. abbot miller...

anyway, for me, bernadette mayer's _midwinter day_ (much cited around here,
and no doubt much read) is at times one of the most moving "domestic"
articulations i've read, though surely not domesticated...

The only book of Jonathan William's prose I have been lucky enough to find
is from the late lamented North Point Press, & it is an absolutely
wonderful collection: _The Magpie's Bagpipe_ (1982). The voice is charming,
the perceptions sharp, the whole a delight. Up herre, it's harder to track
down the poetry, but I am grateful for his work as a publisher, even when
people complain about some of the books' editing, as with Niedecker's _From
This Condensery_, which I am glad to have alongside the selected (also,
gee, from North Point).

We have to be grateful for the generosity of such as Williams, in
everything he did & wrote... (does & writes)...

I imagine that 90% or more of the signers of this list know as little about
what this station "stands for" as I do.  But, hey, go ahead, sign away.
Anything to promote an organisation that favors "democracy", eh?

The common question is the relation between moral clumsiness (to use an
overly polite expression for one case, and what would have 20 years ago
been considered an overly strong expression for the other) and the work,
yes?  The fact of the common question and the different rhetorics in the
separate discussion threads is pretty interesting.

Now where was I reading recently--Mark Twain I think--the proposal
that the works of Shakespeare were written by somebody else--with the
same name.

I wonder if there's a tie in here to Shakes the Clown?

In answer to Judy Roitman's query as to who wrote re:domestic. C'est moi:
Stephen Vincent.

As to Joe Amato's response, I appreciate your references to the recent works
on domestic spaces. I'm a long time fan of Bernandette Meyer's Midwinter Day.


I'm curious, however, in the way that the only cited works are ones that
evoke and explore the association of women within the home space.  In the
case of Bernandette Meyer, I wonder, for example, if Lewis Warsh (I believe
the father to be?), also kept a journal - and if not, is it reasonable to
wonder why not?
How might it have been different, added to the occasion, etc.

In other words, I'm suggesting the territory of the home is much more
"confused" these days (single fathers & mothers, two career couples, lesbian
and gay couples/ parents, etc.) - so I suspect there are more interesting
collisions  in what for many is a new reality, a much altered concept of "the
domestic"  - as a consequence to these changes I look for new
poetries/writing -- work that will have large resonance and issue with public
conventions around the domestic. I certainly find these issue - or an
absorption in these issues - deeply affect the process of my own work.

Cheers,
Stephen Vincent

At Pierre Joris' request for more information on the celebration
of the centennial celebration of the premiere of Ubu Roi in =

San Francisco, I'm posting the text of the commemorative poster,
of which I, one of the disorganizers of the event, am the author.

The sight at Justin Herman Plaza--named for one of the urban
renewal destroyers of the city (see the hideous Yerba Buena Ctr.
on your next visit to neo-Frisco)--was awe-inspiring: a well-policed
area next to a major hotel and just in front of the Ferry Bldg,
the plaza's concrete surface was full of skateboarders ignoring
the stern "No Skateboarding" signs, full of teenage sweethearts
and moms and dads with their kids in line (trans.: "on line" on
the East Coast) for the ice-skating rink, and not at all full of
us, a clump of Jarry-philiacs. We ascended the steps of a pseudo-
fountain to better survey our bewildered and involuntary audience.
And then we delivered: a long speech denouncing and thanking in
the same breath our distinguished mayor, Willy Braun, and other
local notables (the speaker waved a toilet brush for
emphasis; the first scene of Ubu Roi; another couple of incoherent
rants; and then threats of more to come, someday, just you wait and
see!

You should've been there. (Adorno didn't respond to our invitation.
Ezra Pound and T.S. Eliot were fighting in the captain's tower, or
so they said.)

The poster, if anyone wants one, is available. It's 11x14, black with
white type and a reproduction of Jarry's woodcut of Pere Ubu with
the spiral paunch. The word "SHIT" is in red, and really big, a
challenge to the conscientious director. We're asking $5.00 to =

cover our printing and mailing costs. (You can send your requests
to J. Brook, P.O. Box 460431, San Francisco, CA 94146.) But you get
the following text for free:

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

Ubu Rules!

1896-1996

"SHIT!"

Thus begins Alfred Jarry's play, Ubu Roi [Ubu Rex], which had its
premi=E8re one hundred years ago, on December 10, 1896, in Paris, a city
that used to thrive on either bank of the river Seine. If the state of
the world has remarkably improved since 1896, with undreamed-of
innovations in war, mass-murder, exploitation, and destruction of nature
astounding us every year, it is because shit, ladies and gentlemen, has
raised us to its own level. =


Jarry, a brilliant playwright, novelist, poet, sportsman, artist, and
alcoholic, was the inventor of Pataphysics, "the science of imaginary
solutions" that is concerned with "the laws governing exceptions." But
he himself was an ungovernable exception: this pistol-packing midget
bicyclist discovered one key to the good life, the spirit of black
humor. The spirit of black humor begat P=E8re Ubu, spitting image of
middle-class belligerence, insatiable greed, gross appetites,
small-mindedness, lust for power, and gratuitous acts of murder and
mayhem. And thus began the modern world, the
First-Second-Cold-Vietnam-Afghan-Gulf-Yugo-Chechin World War, show
trials, concentration camps, the beginning-middle-and-end of so-called
Communism, the benevolent reign of global capitalism, and so on without
end, amen.

P=E8re Ubu, a Shakespearean irruption from the trailer park of the id,
grabbed the throne of Poland, "which is to say Nowhere," and thus
prefigured what Guy Debord called "the Walesa dynasty." In fact, it is
only by reference to Ubiquitous genealogy that we can begin to
understand the trendsetters of the century-the Hitlers and Stalins, the
Reagans and Yeltsins, the Kohls and Netan-yahoos, wholesale and
retail-not to mention the pinhead bureaucrats who puff out their chests
with surgical implants while fellating restless billionaires.
Governments come and go, but the Will to Shit remains a staunch ally of
the Will to Power. =


On the solemn occasion of the Ubu centennial, then, we celebrate the
successes and excesses of Ubic impulses the world over. Wherever
Phynance and Murder intersect, there you will find Ubu converted to the
coin of the realm and translated into the local idiom. =


Today, December 10, 1996, we defecate in remembrance of the century that
began in obscenity only to end in the universal expletive.

M=C8RE UBU: Now, look, P=E8re Ubu, what kind of king are you? You're
slaughtering everyone!
P=C8RE UBU: Well, SHIT!

i'd like to think that i know niedecker's work well enough to voice my
opinion, and know if it were a male within a domestic situation in
certain ways the p of v would be quite different--don't you think?
and my "domestic" had more to do with living a tough economic life
and with being married to a man in a rural setting.  i'd be happy
to "back up my assertions" with some examples (though there are enough
of them that I'd think my point is pretty obvious--but if we are simply
sharing our favorite LN poems then yes, sure i'll join in--your
contribution was wonderful; it brought me back to LN and I was
and am grateful for it--however, I am writing back to you from work
and my LN stuff is at home, and also this is finals week for me
so I am going crazy, so let me get back to you) when I can get
free to pick out some of my favorite "domestic" poems, maybe next
week or the week after.  Thanks,

S Howe in My Emily Dickinson (God what a book!) mentions that ED probably
was agoraphobic; her p of v, then, even when her imagery was of the
out of doors, could perhaps be thought of as "domestic."  LN was not
agoraphobic, but she was perhaps in some poems trapped in her "domicile"
( i believe the Latin is "domum," no?), and in her marriage as well
--and surely we can say that traditionally when someone is "trapped"
or "walled in" ("Yellow Wallpaper") in a marriage it is the wife and
not the husband.

Someone raised the question as to whether there was a male counterpart to
Midwinter Day, and specifically whether Lewis Warsh had kept a parallel
journal during that pregnancy.  My recollection is that Bernadette and
Lewis did in fact write a journal prose work about their "domestic" life
in the country not long after leaving NYC, with parallel tracking and
alternating chapters.  I cannot recall whether the time span covered was
a month or a year, and my memory is that the work was written with a view
towards reaching a wide audience, but in any case, it was written in 1977
or so and was never published (to my knowledge).

Meanwhile, P. Whalen's SCENES OF LIFE AT THE CAPITAL is a great domestic
epic.

In partial response to Joe's question of days ago --

approx. 80% of "us" teach at non-PhD-granting institutions -- because
some of these are MA-granting (like San Jose State) and have a very small
number of TA's teaching comp., it works out to something like 60% of
English professors working at schools that DO NOT HAVE ANY grad. students
teaching lower-division (or whatever it's called where you live) classes --

Anyway you cut it, the majority of people teaching English do not fit the
model raised in that article.  STILL, I suspect that the majority of
teaching of comp. is still done by people who do not have full-time
status -- anybody know for sure --?

No, no. I think that Shakespeare's works were written by someone with a

Here's one for those who will be attending MLA:  please visit the
University of Alabama Press display (booth 1209) to check out bound
proofs or something similar of my edited collection, _Upper Limit Music:
The Writing of Louis Zukofsky_, which contains essays by poetics list

available, but if you order at the conference you can get a hefty
discount off of the list price.

Thanks for the info. I'm familiar with both, and have gotten some sources
from others: Sulfur 25-27, and the Iowa Review (18/3), where sections of
the Daybook have been published. Incidentally, Michael Davidson has a piece
in his forthcoming book that deals explicitly with Oppen's archive here, so
that should be helpful also...

Hope you're well,

Last week I was invited to a restaurant dinner for a Famous Author.
As it turned out, he was delayed, and the person who'd invited me
was delayed because of his delay, so I met a group of strangers -
except for one of them, a grad student in my department - in the
restaurant. One of the strangers, a book rep for a Big NY Publisher,
introduced himself and his group. I introduced myself, said I'm in
the English dept., then introduced my student, saying she's in the
dept., too. Attention then focused on her: What's it like teaching
here? Had she read X's new book, or Y's? Effusion over her during
most of the meal; every time I opened my mouth, the NY people looked
at me for a moment, smiling wanly, then returned to ask my student
what she thinks of ABCD, and whether she'd be interested in seeing
EFGH in an anthology. During dessert, my student asked about my
forthcoming book. As we discussed it, the NY publishing people were
silent. Then one asked, "Are you on the campus?" They'd clearly
assumed, from the time I introduced us, that my student (who is
white) was a university professor, and that I (whom am not) was not.

Last night, after going into the city to hear Doty & Graham read, I
got to the Metro North train early and took a seat. Two informally
but nicely dressed men got on with two boys, about 10 or 11 years old.
Standing directly behind my seat, one of the boys announced that he
didn't want to ride in a train with niggers. They argued about it for
a few minutes, and left. As they did so, one of the men looked back
at me and sneered.

This is why we have poetry.

Wouldn't it have changed the whole picture of the way in which Bernandette
Meyer's book, Midsummer Day, was received if it had originally been paired
with Lewis Warsh's parallel experience. It does raise questions? Why didn't a
publisher see the value of both? Was there an assumption that there would not
be an interest in the father's experience? (In 1977 I think that would be
true - having become a father at that time as well.)   Whatever might have
been the value system of the publisher (re-affirming the mother-child-home
convention), the alternative of pairing the poetry of both expectant father
and mother might have led to a radical change in the conventional perception
of  "domestic" woman centered consciousness. I'm obviously being speculative
here. However, I wd hope that Lewis' work might some day emerge so as to
compare. (Of course there's the possibility that he didn't feel that
confident about the work and dismissed it).

Mark Scroggins:

Some of us won't be attending MLA. Do you feel like citing or
excerpting an essay or two on the poetics list? Some of us
would appreciate it--especially the sum of us who care about
music and prosody.

For me, not a week goes by without some small consultation of Zukovsky
and Virginia Woolf. What _To the Lighthouse_ is to Bloomsbury prose,
_A_ is to the open field: paradigm and playground. When we write of
music on UB Poetics, I always feel we write to rival _A_.

We've got enough modernist fascists on our bookshelves to besiege the
Capital of Grabenstadt. How fortunate for history's heart, when a decent
man like Z. lives on as a brilliant poet.

(Just did the last line-inputs on the galleys of _Distorture_. I'm off
to the post office and the Zip Disk is off to the printers.)

All the best,

Burt,

My first objection was to the word "poetess"; the "p" word, as I called
it. It is used by Basil Bunting on the sleeve of an (older) copy of The
Granite Pail, and by Jonathan Williams on the sleeve of T&G.

Your response was essentially:

> she [Lorine Neidecker]
> has given us a singular and important view of a woman in a marriage in
> a particular time and place and socio-economic status.

I disagree. The view she continually gives is of the natural world and
sometimes, of American history. She is only slightly concerned with
her socio-economic status, although I searched and found some references
to some jobs she had worked. True, there aren't many midwestern hospital
floor-washing women of the 40s through 60s appearing in the pages of
cutting edge literary magazines, but there aren't many postmen who
become rectors of non-credited colleges either. There aren't many
insurance agents or country doctors either. One might note that WCW
prescription pads affected the line length in some poems, that CO's
knowledge of the citizens on his mail route helped him considerably in
transforming a fishing village into an ancient greek seaport, so it
stands to reason that LN's occupation affected her poetry. Perhaps it
was so boring that she turned shaping words into poems to occupy her
active mind, but that isn't "singular and important". And I find almost
no reference to her marriage in her work. Above all, LN's contribution
to poetry is so much more than an example of the poetry of a person
of a particular gender, marital status, or economic class. I do agree
that her time and place are essential to her poetry.

I asked if you (or anyone for that matter) seeks domesticity in male
poets. It was a rhetorical question. The obvious answer is "no".
you replied:

>...if it were a male within a domestic situation in
> certain ways the p of v would be quite different
and...
> my "domestic" had more to do with living a tough economic life
> and with being married to a man in a rural setting.

The point of view of anyone would be different. A poet like Neidecker
only comes along a few times a century. Almost nobody's point of view is
comparable to a master artist! But suppose all we did was make one X
chromosome into a Y in her, how would her poetry differ? Is there
something "female" in her work? Is there something else that would
replace this if she were a he? What? Typically, women are accused of
emphasizing emotions over reason, of being "sentimental". Of course,
there are many more published male poets whose work is so maudlin it
makes us cry to think that it was published.

Again, I agree about the rural setting, but I  find almost nothing about
her husband in her poetry.

> i'd be happy
> to "back up my assertions" with some examples (though there are enough
> of them that I'd think my point is pretty obvious

Her husband appears in one poem, her daughters in one poem, her gran-
father in one poem Her mother in one poem. Her house appears in several
poems.

Above all, the topics of her poetry are not her contribution to the
almighty canon, it's the way she writes, her sounds and her juxta-
positions that are "singular and important". It is this genius in her
poetry that makes me get up on this soapbox everytime I hear people
talking about her gender. You want domestic? Look at LZ in the late
40s and early 50s. The birth of his son and the death of his father
and his general dissatisfaction with the world made him deliberately
shift his focus. There is a case where time, place, and heritage
are combined influences, but his gender doesn't play a role. I bet you
could grab poems of LZ and LN of that time and give them to people
who are unfamiliar with the work and, because of prejudices, the
majority will incorrectly identify LZ as female and LN as male.

I'm not saying the conditions of any poet's existence don't affect
their work, but remember, this is all because somebody said "poetess".

Women have been shafted by the patriarchy long enough, don't you think?
I have no idea why so many men believed women couldn't or shouldn't
write. I live in these times and an idea like that just doesn't make
sense to me. However, I still hear its repercussions in the word
"poetess". I see mostly men in the anthologies (with the exception of
the Norton pomo thing). This thread started when someone wondered why
Jonathan Williams had to reach back to Dickinson, Lady Ono Komachi, and
Sappho to make comparisons, why the gender was important. I don't know
that answer. It baffles me. It seems reasonable that, if opportunity
is provided to everyone regardless of gender, we double our chances
of getting some awesome reading material; if also regardless of race, we
quadruple our chances.

Perhaps the error is in seeking a reason for prejudice. It isn't a
rational thing. The only result is that it reduces the size of the
competition. One possible cause is the christian religion with its
injuction against women speaking in church. Or it could be a remnant
from the Greek attitudes about women.

Whatever the cause, it is obviously unfounded, but it leads to sad
thoughts like "How many geniuses died unknown? How much did this
superstition lose us?" Clearly, we can't know the answers to these
things. All we can do is put an end to it! When someone says "poetess"
we must react. When someone makes an anthology that excludes most women
we must condemn it. Silence is complicit.

Pete,

I do not mean to delimit LN to domesticity--but you can't deny the domesticity
either, a female, wifely version of it at that, though not at all cliched.
I've already keystroked one "domestic" poem for you in another post a few
minutes ago (Granite Pail p. 20); that one I found by chance.  Now I find,
with deliberation, the following.

I married


in the world's black night
for warmth
          if not repose.
          At the close -
someone.


I hid with him
from the long range guns.
          We lay leg
          in the cupboard, head
in closet.


A slit of light
at no bird dawn -
          Untaught
          I thought
he drank


too much.
I say
          I married
          and lived unburied.
I thought -


(Granite Pail p. 93.  Cf. also: 101, 104 etc. etc.).

So?

stephen, i hear you on the question of un-conventional domestics...

BUT, when you suggest that it may have 'changed the whole picture' to see
warsh's parallel narrative vis-a-vis mayer's, i'm struck somewhat by the
implication (if i'm reading you right) that women's/mother's domestic
narratives are customarily privileged over and against their male
counterparts...

my gut-response is---NO WAY!... i mean, esp. these days, it's men's and
father's experiences of domesticity, incl. childbirth, that are
fashionable, *not* women's... women have, up to the 20th century, often
been forced into masculinist modes of writing/subject choice which
precluded their relating *truly intimate* domestic narratives... i'll give
you three recent examples of recent male domestic narratives:  bob
shacochis' cover-story in (october's?) _harper's_ of his wife's
infertility; michael berube's recent book on his son's downs syndrome, _;
bob green's book _good morning merry sunshine_, about his daughter's first
year... shacochis' essay is deeply moving, but maintains a distance from
his subject that even he notes, and one can't help but wondering at times
why he's the one telling the story; berube's work is also provocative,
fascinating -- the point here is not that these stories don't deserve
telling, but one has to wonder why women's stories have formerly been
discouraged by a publishing system which has now "given birth" to an
emergence of Sensitive Male stories -- right around the time when the
Sensitive Male became fashionable (and Sensitive Males have access to a
mainstream publishing apparatus which their female counterparts still
largely lack)...

anyway, i was raised by a single father after the age of 13 (with one
sibling) from the late 60s through the 70s... and i understand how
difficult it can be to find a space to talk about such experiences... but
wrt publishing, i'd have to suggest that we'll have to pose  more searching
questions about whose stories get told, and why...

best,

Larry Fagin has been saying for some time that he was going to do something
about the bookstore situation in New York City, and lo, he has. At his
instigation, St Marks Book Shop ordered hundreds of poetry titles from SPD,
all of which arrived on the shelves yesterday. I bought four books there
yesterday: _Men In Aida_, _My Trip to New York City_, _5000 Musical Terms_
and _The World of Leon_. Odd as it sounds, these are books it would have
been unimaginable to find on any bookstore shelf in New York until
yesterday. If you're in New York, you should go see. If you buy some poetry
books, mention to the store how much you like their poetry section, and how
much it's improved.

This is from _The World of Leon_--

One Sunday, one Monday, every week
Makes two days out of seven.
Three times six is not eleven
Except in heaven.
A dark cloud jogs beside us laughing amiably.
Then we stop and look around.
Numbers come everywhere from the heavens, 1-10.
The saintly six.
The redoubtable three.
The peaceful four.
The sports-car driving five.
The lunatic nine.
The recumbent governor eight.
The wheelchair one.
The pessimistic seven.
The metal two.
The hit-and-run ten.
They join us at the clouded structure
Where angels find their conjunctions and well-wishers
Wave one last long goodbye.
The unnumbered question is our sleep in which these structures hide.

Where her touch is like a helping hand
That reaches down to lift you up to where it is--

Almost a week since your notes re: Crash, etc.  Time, er, flies.  I like
what you have to say here, Mike, and I'm not quite sure where I want to
disagree. --- Aside on my hesitance about all this: have decided it was
not coincidental that the difference I gestured at concerned the Middle
Ages, and with Pound in mind have gone back to reading some Chaucer, not
since a dozen years ago.  Found a description of the gothic aesthetic in
the intro to my paperback that seems almost to fit EP's practice in say
the Cantos, and trying now to hammer all this out as an alternative to
the Romantic lyric consciousness (the sort of thing at least Creeley
mentions in the Whitman story, the New Critical ideal of epiphany poem,
etc.).  --- Now maybe you have something here in the way you put it,
that it has to do with a refusal of knowledge.  Looking out my window
this morning I was thinking how a modern poet might carefully describe
the sky's grey qualities, the bareness of the trees, et et et cetera,
all the while scrupulously avoiding the word "winter", and might feel
that this avoidance was the essence of the art.
                        So here's where I'm in a way arguing against the
position I held in the late running battle over "taste", because I begin
to wonder now about this purer perception the virtues of which I was
more or less extolling, resistance to the narrative impulse and all
that.  Chomsky somewhere says his work in linguistics and politics has
run along twin tracks: "Plato's problem", how we know so much given so
little evidence; and "Orwell's problem", how we know so little given so
much evidence.  The latter maybe what we're talking about here.
        Now you distinguish here in a rough way between the narratives
that come readily to hand (the "quick social fix") and the ones that
might require a special sort of alertness and sensitivity.  Can't help
but feel the problem I'm having has to do in part with the loss of a
common frame of reference, the sort of presumption Chaucer & Shakespeare
can make upon their audience's knowledge, or if you prefer "knowledge",
point of view? whatever.  "Whan that April with his shoures soote/ [...]
Than longen folk to goon on pilgrimages" --- what is that "then"?  Most
natural thing in the world, and I'd assume not an idea unique to
Chaucer's unique sensibility.  A commonplace?  Knowledge?

So there're some notes, along lines similar to the ones you were
responding to -- something to do with a refusal of meaning, a refusal of
knowledge, a refusal of narrative, all of which I'm more & more thinking
of as the heritage of the Enlightenment and Romanticism, if you follow
the way I've drifted.  Maybe the key word in all this was "natural" just
there, talking about Chaucer's "then" -- and I probably should have said
"ordinary", "everyday", so's I could gesture toward Wittgenstein, whose
project consisted largely in a recovery of the ordinary knowledge
post-Enlightenment philosophers had pretended to have forgotten.  And
maybe that's what I need to get at in our difference from
pre-Renaissance days, the ordinariness of their knowledge of signs and
symbols, the wide currency of it, etc.  And maybe that's the difference
between what you're saying about Cronenberg (& Ballard) and what I'm
saying -- I'm not sure I could tell the difference between seeing them
as exceptions in a culture of a denial and seeing them as unique
sensibilities along more Romantic lines, men who see what others don't,
all that, visionaries.  Maybe there's no alternatives anymore, that I
don't know.  But I'm trying to think about the reverse here, about not
uniquely failing to see what everyone else does.  (Not sure I'm ready to
conclude I live in far & away the stupidest time in history, tempting
though that view is.)  Not failing to see, for instance, what so many
poets whose works fill imoprtant journals each month fail to see, that
what they're writing about is perfectly ordinary.

My usual incoherence, just trying to keep the virtual ball rolling,
Pat

thanx aldon... so 60% of english profs. don't have any ta's...

i think nafg (national adjunct faculty guild) reports something like 40% of
ALL courses (all disciplines, all schools) are taught by *part-time
adjunct* faculty...

so the problem, again, seems to have less to do with ta's and more to do
with issues surrounding adjunct faculty...

I said something about finding _The World of Leon_ on a NY bookstore shelf
being 'unimaginable until yesterday'. Obviously this is nonsense on the

That was how it was at Cleveland State University. I took an M.A. in
philosophy and taught English comp. there before coming to Buffalo as a
Ph.D. student. Cleveland State offers only the M.A. in English.
GA-ships are few, and graduate students do not teach classes there, but
composition classes are taught for the most part by lecturers, who are
local residents, often with M.A.'s from Cleveland State. They teach on a
quarter-by-quarter basis; usually they teach one course only, which earns
them $1600 - $1700 per quarter. They supplement their
income by teaching at local community colleges, which offer much lower
rates, generally $600 -700 per class per quarter. With luck they are able
to average around $15,000 a year for this work. They receive no health
benefits and are not eligible for unemployment. I knew several who have
been teaching for 15 or more years on this basis. They are almost never
able to get full-time positions at these colleges.

My sister, Carol Pressler-Lavrisha, is a metal sculptor with an M.F.A.
who has been teaching art appreciation and art history classes in local
colleges for nine years now. Most of those years have been spent at one
community college. Not only has she never been offered a full time
position, but when one became available at that college, the part-time
faculty were not told about it.

She found out there was a job available and demanded that she be allowed
to apply, only to have the permanent faculty sabotage her interview and
then refuse to give her further part-time classes. She is now teaching at
another local school.

A couple of tales from the front lines -- are there others?

You're right of course, Jerry. I just don't know a lot about that more
recent history. Did Counterpoint follow immediately upon the demise of North
Point? And are they selling older North Point books?

Subject:      Re: Domestic/Meyer/Warsh

Dear Joe,
You wrote:
"stephen, i hear you on the question of un-conventional domestics..."

I'm not sure you hear me! I think I've previously argued that the
 "conventional" definition of "domestic" - or the definition of what occurs
within the home space is either kaput, or a retro concept. The "convention"
is in question, and the "unconventional" -- in any number of forms -- is
being tested, contested and variously forged.

You continue:
"BUT, when you suggest that it may have 'changed the whole picture' to see
warsh's parallel narrative vis-a-vis mayer's, i'm struck somewhat by the
implication (if i'm reading you right) that women's/mother's domestic
narratives are customarily privileged over and against their male
counterparts..."

 Most likely not "the whole picture" in some grand societal sense, but
certainly in the way in which we, as readers. would have engaged the shared
circumstance of both Mayer and Warsh. In reviewing the book today, I kept
noticing several times in which she notes that Lewis is in another room
writing. Since I haven't seen Lewis's writing, I might guess that he's taking
care of Sophie, their child, while Bernadette is writing etc. This round
robin of each interpreting their consiousness of this shared space might have
been a remarkable document. It would not have "priviledged" either mother or
father or either writer. To the contrary - precluding Lewis' writing was as
focused on the situation as Bernandette's - I believe we would have been
offered a unqiue and revelatory view of the consciousness of both figures
 wrestling  with the new arrival. In this way, I think such a book would be
revolutionary. It's neither a pull for patriarchy or matriarchy - or men or
women centered writing. Done with conviction it's an attempt to explore
shared space - and done jointly it offers the possibility of making inclusive
rather than exclusive statements in which one writer(gender) has power over
the absent other. At least I would like to think that we've gotten to that
point - and that's why I was fascinated with  Warsh/Mayer's unpublished
project

You continue:
"my gut-response is---NO WAY!... i mean, esp. these days, it's men's and
father's experiences of domesticity, incl. childbirth, that are
fashionable, *not* women's... women have, up to the 20th century, often
been forced into masculinist modes of writing/subject choice which
precluded their relating *truly intimate* domestic narratives..."

No problem - tho I suspect there are some who will argue that Stein and Woolf
among others worked the territory.

You continue:
"i'll give
you three recent examples of recent male domestic narratives:  bob
shacochis' cover-story in (october's?) _harper's_ of his wife's
infertility; michael berube's recent book on his son's downs syndrome, _;
bob green's book _good morning merry sunshine_, about his daughter's first
year... shacochis' essay is deeply moving, but maintains a distance from
his subject that even he notes, and one can't help but wondering at times
why he's the one telling the story; berube's work is also provocative,
fascinating -- the point here is not that these stories don't deserve

I'm not totally sure of your point. I go a little 'knee jerk' at the
expression "Sensitive Males." I think it's good to question the source of the
maker of the phrase. I suspect none of the writers of these pieces go around
calling themselves "Sensitive Males". I do suspect people who are threatened
by men taking the responsibility for different roles - particularly in the
domestic realm - find the expression a suitable term of harassment. To me it
comes off as similar to the offensive phrases applied to women in positions
of power traditionally held by men. With the exception of the Green book, you
seem taken by the work!

You continue:

"anyway, i was raised by a single father after the age of 13 (with one
sibling) from the late 60s through the 70s... and i understand how
difficult it can be to find a space to talk about such experiences... but
wrt publishing, i'd have to suggest that we'll have to pose  more searching
questions about whose stories get told, and why..."

I wouldn't use the problem with publishers (and why they make the gender etc.
oriented marketing choices they do) to not tell your story -  (which I hope
is not the subtext of your point).  However, to back up, my whole original
point - when the thread started about the Niedecker blurbs - was that I found
it disturbing that some were arguing that in no way was it appropriate to be
at all identified with "the domestic."  On the contrary I would argue that
the domestic is a loaded venue. Obviously not the only one. But a place where
many arguments in the current culture take root. (As a single father of two
teen-agers I can say the 'cultures' rush through here in giant, not always
comfortable, but most often fascinating waves). To cast out the domestic as a
vital constituent seems fool hardy to me. To seek a writing that embraces the
polarities that occur within the domestic - whether from point of view of
child, man or woman - seems to me a valuable project. Equally - I agree with
you - it's important to critically expose publishers who priviledge and
profit by making fashion of one point of view over another, as well as
support those publishers with more comprehensive in their view.

Rob,

Zukofsky (with an "f") never wrote a poem entitled _A_. He did,
however, write a poem entitled _"A"_. You managed to get only one-third
of the title into your message.

My question (to the list) is this: what is the most famous instance of
this misreading, which has occurred thousands of times? My nomination
is Hoover's Postmodern.

Well, the most famous instance I know of occurred in late 1977, when
Prince Philip was hosting a royal dinner for a congeries of literary
luminaries in London.  Here's an excerpt from an exchange between
Philip and Prof. Murg Szweft of the Univ. of Left Overbie, reported
in the London Daily Telegaff:

PP: Well, I say, you know, this Zonkoffski or Zakoversky, I've read
into it a bit - not bloody English, that A of his, what?

MS: Pardon, my dear Duke - that's quotation mark A quotation mark.

PP: Eh?  Don't quite follow you there, old chap.

MS: the title of the book - "A" - it's in quotation marks.

PP: Not what we learned in public school, old man.  Book titles in
italics - individual poems in quotes, I daresay!

MS:  It IS an individual poem.

PP: Well, yes, but I'm talking about the _book_, man!

MS: Have you read it, my dear fellow?

PP:  What?  Book or poem?

MS: Very good, my lord!  Jolly good!

PP:  Wait - you haven't heard the Z of it - heh heh!!

Clearly the Daily Telegaff is stepping around Prince Phil rather discreetly
these days - this is all a bit tame, considering the explosive subject
under discussion.   - Henry Gould

More later, Pat, but I wanted quickly to draw attention to a spot on
TV last night about an image of the Virgin Mary appearing on the glass
windows of an office building in Florida.

It was quite amusing as the reporter went from those identified as
"believers" who were worshipping the office building--well, at least
the image on it--to those identified as "scientists" who were
worshipping reason's ability to "explain" the image in terms of
mineral deposits, ground water flows, etc. (except they couldn't
explain the continuity of the image across multiple panes of
glass--yet), to the owner of the building who, after trying
unsuccessfully to scrub the damn spot out, was starting to calculate
what this meant in terms of potential profits. Meanwhile the mealy
mouthed reporter--this was on Hard Copy, and the blonde bimbo anchor
was saying, "Harry, you're a serious news reporter, what do you make
of this"--was desperately trying to cover all bets by acknowledging
everyone's meaning as being a true meaning.

Meanwhile I'm thinking, whoa, there's a whole a lot meaning going on!

As they say up here in multicultural Canada--season's greetings to all
and to all a goodnight!

I have seen Thomas Bell's experiences repeated all too many times in my life.
An odd coincidence -- At some point every semester, one of the students
in my ethnic studies course will opine on the "fact" that racism isn't a
problem any more.  This invariably is followed by news a la Texaco in the
papers (always presented as a rare instance of rogue behavior) --

The "service" sector is always revealing.  Often when my wife and I are
in store -- the clerk who is waiting on me will look up at my wife,
standing there beside me and holding my hand, with a puzzled expression
and ask, "was there something you wanted help with?"

As far as I know (which at this point in the morn ain't far) Counterpoint
does not sell old North Point titles.  They've done some nice art books
for recent shows in the DC area (most notably, the Phillips Collection's
"Americans in Paris" exhibit), and some of their recent titles include
W.S. Merwin's mini-anthology _Lament for the Makers_ and Evan S. Connell's
_Collected Stories_.  Other than Merwin and Snyder, I don't think they
really "do" much poetry, though.

stephen:  quickly ('cause i've got one more day before i split these parts
for points east), reading back over you reading back over me, i think we're
in basic agreement, but i feel the need to clarify a bit:

(1) i certainly didn't mean to imply that berube et al ARE, ontologically
or some such, Sensitive Males, though they may be (like me, like others i
hope) sensitive males... yes, i am taken by such work, esp. berube's book,
_life as we know it:  a father, a family, and an exceptional child_---it's
really quite remarkable (consider this a plug for his book)... i was using
uppercase, clumsily i guess, to denote what the publishing-marketing
apparatus is busy doing... anybody knows me knows i wouldn't 'not tell my
story' on the basis of said apparatus... JUST TRY TO GET ME TO SHUT UP!...
but anybody knows me knows that the *way* i might tell my stories might be
distinctively at odds with storytelling as popularly conceived (might be i
say---sometimes i'm orthodox as hell)... i just don't think we can talk
about constructing 'domestic' space using our abc's without some view
toward who's reading said construction... if there are plenty of readers
'out there' primed for a particular narrative, this will (sometimes
unfortunately) result in more such stories... but in any case, we do (as i
think you suggest) need to unpack 'sensitive male' (and perhaps think a bit
more about how 'iron john' & co. fits into this picture)...

(2) stein and woolf would be exceptions to the rule, *to the extent that
they're writing about intimate experience that's often highly coded*...
they're not the first writers that come to (my) mind when it comes to
childbirth narratives, for example (and for obvious reasons)... but in any
case both are 20th century writers, and my point was about women writers
*up to the 20th. century*... by which i meant *prior to*...

(3) you still haven't said anything that persuades me to believe that i
DON'T hear you on the question of domestic space, stephen!... my own
orientation is rather techno---i'm interested actually in how broader
conceptions of hygiene, cooking, even home education figure into the 'home
office' [wink]... this is why i cited that zone piece (which is chock-full
of other references)... you sound as though you're more interested in the
various people, and corresponding roles and perspectives, that populate
such spaces... but anyway... i think we're close here, by which i mean
close on the primary point of these posts (as i understood it, anyway)...
i've written mself (i think!) on my own domestic spaces, albeit i have to
acknowledge *this* discussion as having foregrounded for me the way the
word itself figures my understanding of such stuff... i think in fact a
simple term such as "head of household" could be a rich site from which to
begin writing (poetry, scholarship, whatever)...

anyway, thanx for the back & forth!...

best,

I think it's ironic that Lewis Warsh, one of the odder story tellers
around, would be accused of some kind of self-aggrandizing centrality..
he's definitely in one of those wavering elliptical orbits as anyone who's
read his novels would agree... Joe A if I had an extra copy of _Agnes &
Sally_ I'd mail it to you..

Of course I may be misreading this whole argument, but I agree with Stephen
Vincent that the 'parallel text' of Lewis's account of the time would make
a picture of that particular domestic arrangement more complex and
energetic.. those being the virtues I look for..

Exactly. It's exotic. The exotic domestic. I could write about
cleaning the toilet, and some people would see that as NEWS. MAN
CLEANS TOILET. Up to a point. Precisely because I'm still not expected
to clean the toilet. Even by me, and I stay home with the baby and
cook every day. However, I _am_ expected to take out the garbage
Tuesday night, even when it's 20 below. Is that domestic? Does it
stop at the door? Or is it a kind of gesture?

My re-punctuation of the title _A_ was deliberate. Others, including
the author himself (or "himself") may refer to _A_ however they like;
I'm extremely fond of Z.'s word-music, but not always of his overly-
ambitious theories, which strike me as necessary in terms of his own
approach to form, but not necessarily as practical theories for
interpreting his approach. Nor do I intend to adopt every idiosyncrasy
of Z.'s writing in speaking of it simply because--like a homophobe
pointing to an inhumane parable in The Bible--I found a precedent.

You can rankle at my ur-standardizations if you like--I'm just having
a good time. If it were up to me, people would write E. E. Cummings
in caps as well.

(An aside: Z.'s use of Bach's "Allemande" has always reminded me of
Glenn Gould's radio plays; Gould, however, thought it important to
leave the music out.I'm still not certain why the music has to be there,
but reserve judgment until I hear that section of _A_ performed.)

>My question (to the list) is this: what is the most famous instance of

Actually, I'd say the most common misreading on this list occurs
when pomo buffs read formalist ideas as necessarily bourgeois,
uneducated, outmoded, or formally stiff. The truth is, I scan Zukofsky
(or Thomas Bernhard, for that matter) whenever I read him. And I'm not
certain he'd have hated the musician in me for doing so.

BTW: My problem with the boolean division of formalist/pomo is that it
leaves a lot of variables out of the equation. It strikes me as a
substance (rather than process) division. I'm not even certain
that langpo/formalists emphasize different areas of language: in both
cases, the emphasis would seem to be on surface tension. Personally,
I prefer Bergson, Bennett and Heraclitus to Derrida. But I'm not trying
to escalate an unpleasant skirmish. I'm simply pointing out that, for me,
the insistence on non-standardization (a la LangPo) proves rather
literal-minded in the context of my own theoretical practice. I'm not
telling anyone else how to write. I'm just explaining how I myself write
and punctuate.

All the best,

Rob Hardin

(who also refuses, for example, to shift gender on the collective
pronoun *he* and *himself* until we agree to standardize two neutral
third-person singular pronouns (possibly *s/he* and *her/m*).)

PS: If you're truly going to attempt to nail email authors
for spelling and punctuation, then you've got your work cut out for
you. But more importantly, I think your argument--for Z's punctuation--
gets misplaced in your insistence on mere insistence.

In his long & proocative response to 'Mike on meaning', Patrick Foley made
this point:
" Looking out my window
this morning I was thinking how a modern poet might carefully describe
the sky's grey qualities, the bareness of the trees, et et et cetera,
all the while scrupulously avoiding the word "winter", and might feel
that this avoidance was the essence of the art."
Later, he talked about the 'ordinary' & the 'commonplace', for which terms
we still tend to us the culturally charged word 'natural.' And so, I took
off in my mind on another track: which was to admit to myself that I have
certainly practiced something like that poem without the word 'winter' in
it, but also left out such things as the color of the various buildings,
probably didn't mention the specks of snow caught on the wires, nor
noticed, in the writing, the garbage cans. Not that many writers dont
notice some of the 'stuff' of the modern urbs, but that the 'romantic' urge
to 'capture' the essence of the moment, supposedly 'in nature' tends to
ignore how much of that nature, the commonplaces we live in & among, are
also part of what the avoidance is 'about', at least if we still practice
'lyric' as traditionally understood. When I wrote that way (a long time ago
of course), I guess I still did buy into lyric in a way (Oh Dave Smith,
where are you when we need you? gone, alas, to grass...)...

How does that idea of 'the natural' tie into the way the 'domestic' is also
assumed to be a sign of the feminine?

Of course, in Canada, as George has probably made clear back before I got
on this list, we have had such a strong representation of powerful woman
poets since at least WW2, there has been the interesting situation in which
many male poets have admiringly stated that they have been influenced by
some of those woman (bp nichol often mentioned it; I know a few I owe more
than a bit to)...

Which reminds me, christianity's insistence on the silence of women still
has its power: up here there have been a number of powerful writers emerge
from a culture in which that rule holds, the Mennonites: take for example
the poetry of Di Brandt, whose first book, _questions i asked my mother_ is
all about breaking that prohibition. a battle she has carried on ever
since...

There is another way to frame this process in relation to Romanticism,
one that places it in a larger, if rather controversial, context than
stylistics:

        For Novalis, the poet's genesis is at issue, not the poem's,
        that is, he derives the poem's authenticity from the primacy
        of moral rather than linguistic autonomy. Not that he would
        deny linguistic autonomy. . . . rather he would deny
        linguistic autonomy could be considered anything but a
        function of the self's capacity for free moral agency, and
        that is the crucial difference between Novalis and all those
        for whom art constitutes a self-sufficient enterprise, be they
        symbolists or their contemporary heirs. Consequently, his
        central topic is always the poetic work's own origin depicted
        as the developmental path by which the self gains
        consciousness of its inherent freedom.

I find this argument just a little specious. Rather than seeing a title as
an example of idiosyncratic theory, I see it (if it's indeed the author who
gave it the title) as every bit as much a part of the work as is any line or
word of the text of that work. So, would you equally change/misquote lines
of Zukofsky? I tend to think of the quotation marks and the rest of the
title as part of the work, and even if I don't like that part of the work
(although in this case I do), to intentionally change them seems to be
simply a mistake. I would more easily understand the inadvertent dropping of
the quotation marks than the intentional mis-quoting of the author.

Being that you (Jordan), signed with Joe's (Ceravolo) "Ho Ho Ho Caribou,"
this gives me the perfect opportunity to respond to this curious thread
about the varieties of poetic life experience, which have resulted in
many simultaneous accounts of their respective "domestic" lives, kept by
those married poets/writers/artists with children from the 1960s to the
present.

First of all, let me say, Bernadette and Lewis were good friends of Joe
and me during those childbearing and rearing years, which we all documented
in our own individual and unique ways. The same deep friendships existed
with other 'poetic' couples we knew and entertained so many times here
on Spruce Street. They included Kathleen Fraser and Jack Marshall,
Ted and Sandy Berrigan, the Padgetts, David and Lindsay Shapiro,
the Frank Limas, Sotere Torregian & family, the Charles North and Paul Violi
families; the List goes on and on with the fondest of memories....

"Parallel texts" or other art forms that tell and portray the stories of
everyday life within these poetically-charged, conjugal unions are most
likely available to anyone who is sincerely interested. Let's not forget
such worthy records derive from an important era of change dating back only
to the late 1960s, when women as mothers, wives of poets, and creative
beings of individual value in their own rights, didn't hesitate to make
themselves heard and recognized, either privately or publicly.

This unavoidable acknowledgement of the other's indisputable equality in
such marriages began a contemporary phenomenon, which to this day, has
little or nothing to do with conventional notions of "domestic" life. Each
partner within the intimate levels of these given relationships, despite
prevailing societal norms, was always recognized as equal to the other.
Whatever problems encountered concerning this matter-of-fact equality by
each or both partners, were either worked-out lovingly through mutual
integration and acceptance by the couple, or led to irreconcilable
differences with predictable results.

The interest expressed in Lewis's side of the Story is rather fascinating
to me. Bernadette chose to record every minutiae, including fact or fantasy,
of her pregnancies, the after events, and how they affected her. If Lewis
kept a simultaneous account during this period of their lives together,
there's no guarantee it will supply any missing links to Bernadette's
version of their Story together. Art is not merely biographical journalism,
after all. Bernadette simply published her work of this period and that
again, was her discreet choice as an insightful artist.

I know Joe's poetry is his own take on the myriad ways life was experienced
by him. We were married for the full duration of his life as a great poet.
Where I actually fit in to his poetry during this 30 year period, remains
open-ended and mysterious. Thanks to the Muses, my writings over this
same period contain what I chose as worthy of my own sensibilities as an
artist. The similarities are as revealing as the differences in how Joe
and I lived and loved together.

I had always thought, actually, that _A_ was called "A" because Zukofsky, in
titling his
long long poem "A" was parodying or attacking or what-you-will the perhaps
pretentious habit of giving long "epic" poems grandiose titles. HIS long
poem is entitled -- like so many lyrics in crummy-and-otherwise text-book
anthologies -- nothing at all, but simply quotes the first line of the poem.
Is it also worth noting that, _A_ or "A", the title is pronounced as a
schwa, UH?

I'm not at all clear how this is "formalist".

The point, as i saw it, wasn't the proper punctuation of the
title of LZ's *"A"* ( or is that _"A"_ ?). The most common, not
necessarily most famous, misreading is that the title is the
first letter of the alphabet, when it's clearly the indefinite
article; longer but not as dense as his earlier poem entitled
by the definite article. The quotation marks indicate that it
is a spoken word. I don't know why he italicized it ... anyone?

A few months passes. I figure, hey how bout saying howdy to a few of them
folks on that there academic poetry list, in time for a holiday, let them
know I'm scantilly living in my new digs.

Rob Hardin, still arguing. When we have "A" there is a separation textually
of its immediacy and surroundings. The "A" becomes something of an
artificial significance, an authoriative ideology to point toward a
signifier whose referent has been erased. Whoso art forth in book copped
from? From which "A" divine?  Let me quote a number of folks to prove my
point, to give me a bookish authoritorial:  "the "A" when subjectively
received, becomes the cup wreathed with ivy" or "even "A" word doubles to
move from one meaning to another" or "Ko Niutirenis hauru leish! "A" lala!
Ko Niutirenis haururu laleish!" I have altercated the previous quotes
according to an antithesis based upon the Hardin theory of the punctual,
that quotes surrounding words, in addition to their meaning, are irrelevant.
One meritorious poet of the confessional age once said we should liberally
sprinkle quotes on the page like sparkles to the glue. I still fail to
ingest what is synonymous with glue.

Ron:
"My question (to the list) is this: what is the most famous instance of
this misreading, which has occurred thousands of times?
        My nomination is U of Cal Press 1978 printing of "A" 1-24, where it
all started. Unlike Cape or Grossman there's no quotes on the cover, so one
would have to open the book to find the quotes & we all know how few people
actually ever read these books. Who has time in this modernity with the
exception of those whose livelihood is not threatened by.

Charles, I don't have yr address in AZ.

You can also use the plural form, as many Americans do in everyday
speech -- fits some cases anyway.  "Nobody in this place knows what
they're talking about."  Gender neutral.  Of course your English Comp

Eight replies on the subject of a single instance of punctuation; on
a variant (or fugitive, if you're orthodox) reading of a single title!
English teachers on this list should rejoice at such strenuous attentions.
I'll answer as many responses as I can, but won't respond to all, since
I have deadlines, and contributing to this list is, of course, a luxury.

1. *A*, _A, "A, "a", "A," *a_, ""A, a"", a*, and so on, are variations
on "A" (or _"A"_), the provocative title submitted by Louis Zukofsky. The
title has always seemed to me to emphasize the microstructures of the poem,
and to call attention to the minutiae of numerical and sequential operations
of a book that was inspired in part by the various compositional practices
of Bach, and by the historical responses (fugues on the name B-A-C-H,
etc.) that Bach's work provoked. It seems to me that Z.'s approach to
writing invites such playfulness, as do the many symmetries that appear
(A-Z) whenever the book is discussed in detail.

2. I responded to the title not as an idiosyncratic theory but as
idiosyncratic practice:

>>Nor do I intend to adopt every idiosyncrasy
>>of Z.'s writing in speaking of it simply because I--like a homophobe
>>pointing to an inhumane parable in The Bible--found a precedent.

3. I made no *serious* charge regarding Zukofsky's punctuation. As I
indicated in my response, I was joking:

>>You can rankle at my ur-standardizations if you like--I'm just having
>>a good time. If it were up to me, people would write E. E. Cummings
>>in caps as well.

If my inference--that writers ought to "correctly" restore capital
letters in the work (and name) of E.E. Cummings--struck you as a
serious proposal, then I might have to resort to more hideous devices
to make my ironic intent known, such as emoticons.

4. I am quite interested in the larger point of your response, which
is exactly the one I sought to address:

>>So, would you equally change/misquote lines
>>of Zukofsky? I tend to think of the quotation marks and the rest of the
>>title as part of the work, and even if I don't like that part of the work
>>(although in this case I do), to intentionally change them seems to be
>>simply a mistake. I would more easily understand the inadvertent dropping of
>>the quotation marks than the intentional mis-quoting of the author.

In instances of appropriation, I choose only to change or misquote what
I consider to be familiar to the reader. In the case of Zukofsky's writing
as it pertains to this particular list, I see no reason to be reverent
about a title that everyone here knows. However, in the case of an individual
*line* of _A_, I would choose to cite it correctly in order to play with it
(as I would an obscure theme in a set of musical variations), because I
can't presume that it has the same level of familiarity.

This is an argument that I've had with Kathy Acker for years. When she
chooses to appropriate the titles and themes of, say, Dickens or Cervantes,
I see the reason for it. When she decides to rewrite a bestseller by
Sidney Sheldon, or lines from a newspaper, I can understand the
point as well. But when she rewrites mere passages from Genet or Sade
without acknowledging either writer, and when she rewrites the ideas
of writers who are more obscure, I do wish that she would give those
writers credit, or make some reference to the text she is changing,
autonomy of the text notwithstanding, so that readers can seek it out.
In the section of _In Memoriam_ in which she rewrites Baudelaire and
Rimbaud, I feel she is toying with poems that are sufficiently known
to the reader. But personally, I would not want to tamper with a text
that is insuffiently known in the first place. I say this not in order
to dictate a standard to anyone else but rather to clarify my own
idiosyncratic views and practice.

Here is another question that provoked me to play with "Z"'s title. It
seems to me that the idea of *not* privileging an author is a philosophical
dead end. It is also an idea that gets discarded whenever the battle
over stature gets fought on a smaller scale. Would anyone care if I
changed the title of _Loaves of Gas_? Would anyone object if I were to
refer to a film called _Trainsprouting_, or if I were to "correct" (as I
am about to do on the Permeable Press page) the colon-riddled prose of
_The Atrocity Exhibition_ line by line? These works seem sufficiently
known and/or exalted by mainstream culture; such work is often manipulated
by some of the poets on this list. But what about the work that is dearer
to us, the work that is more central to our practice? If we object to the
manipulation of these texts, are we not guilty of maintaining a double-
standard in our own private literary hierarchy?

Certain nameless quasi-Marxist writers turn vicious over matters of
their own micro-reputations, all while maintaining what seems to me to
be spurious contempt for the so-called Canon. What good is the contempt of
such writers, if humor does not allow them to take a deflating view of
what they themselves consider to be important?

I've always thought so too, hence my reference to Cummings's
ostentatious typographical modesty. But at some point, such
fail-safes against immodesty (either for author or text) become
obsolete: when the work becomes the site of scholarly excavations.

It seems to me that _A_ was born and bred for excavation, and that,
microstructures notwithstanding, Z's calling *A* by the name of "A"
invites the telescope as well as the magnifying glass.

I didn't know that. What is the source of your pronunciation info?

That was an unnecessary ad hominem leap on my part. In the course of being
on this list, I've watched non-pomo-praxis poets and critics get trashed
in exceptionally impolite and smug-sounding ways. Silliman's punctuation-
flame is an instance of classic bad nettiquite: it is not considered
polite or useful to flame someone over instances of misspelling or
mispunctuation in email. The connection I made--between past instances
and this present one--was both unclear and unjustified, and that I must
acknowledge.

The *point* of a punctuation-flame does not change its classification
and operation *as* a punctuation flame.

This is useful information. Thanks for posting it.

Since you haven't been on listserve for awhile, perhaps you require
a synopsis. The most heated arguments of late have been over Adorno,
arguments in which I did not participate. For months, my posts have
been limited to attempts to help posters with infomation about things
like quantitative verse (BTW: On p. 378 of _A_, there is an
interesting citation on the subject of quantity in modern verse.),
to shameless self-promotion (I announced two new boooks of my own),
and to expressing my enthusiastic interest in other writers like Jacques
Servin. In one such note, concerning Mark Scroggins's (and Peter
Quartermain's) _Upper Limit Music: The Writing of Louis Zukofsky_,
I asked Scroggins to post an excerpt from the new book, and expressed
affection for Zukofsky's poetry and persona. My non-standard
punctuation of the title {A} provoked esteemed poet Ron Silliman to
write a punctuation flame. My own response was not a flame but rather
an explanation. (How can anyone ever mention A' without toying with
the title?)

The more charitable (and logical) view of past controversies involving
me is this: the controversy involves my ideas and not my character.

That edition, of course, is the only edition of ^A- that I own (or have
ever owned): I bought it at the Strand eight years ago. Hence it seemed
that the edition itself invited play.

All the best,

Rob Hardin

an introductory essay by Forrest Gander entitled "The Inflorescence

Rob, Thanks for the update. The controversy was not supplied to insinuate
harm upon your e-character. But rather the humeric was lost as mentioned below:

>Certain nameless quasi-Marxist writers turn vicious over matters of
>their own micro-reputations, all while maintaining what seems to me to

which suspiciously seems a hidden commentary. So to riff off HG:
When the real marxists come you'll be quaking in your white knee highs &
tennis shoes.

1st. I uphold the canon, it's kept our journal going. Pound's ethics have
reversed intentionality into the false 23rd phase of the moon. See, there is
this outside world that doesn't believe poetry is readable anymore.
Marginalizations of "marxist," "work poetry," "labor poetry," in reviews
hardly bother me, especially when combined with "experimental,"
"avant-guard," "anti-formal," "otherstream" & "formalist." In fact I am
grateful for this Laconian naming deal: it's given us an audience, inside & out.

2nd. I understand the inclusion of certain writers in the canon will destroy
the term, that there isn't the ideology for them. For their work would
involve combining the "canons" of poetry, fiction, painting, music, and
anon, & who in their right mind is willing, or has the right, to give that
power.

3rd. Be suspicious of any folks who uphold the notion of anti-literature:
dollars to doughnuts they have based their careers on it.

Be well

Okay, Hardin'


I am taking back everything I said about you young guns not having seen the
spaghetti westerns, if you will concede that us old guys have experienced
double latte easy on the foam.

But I hafta warn you, when I was only 15 there were lone riders all over my
native Okanagan cactus country looking for fame, which they hoped to get by
drawing down on me in front of the Rexall. I turned in my guns and got the
postmaster's daughter on his porch swing. She persuaded me that she would
give me everything if I could learn to play the saxohorn like Prez. I tried
and tried but I could never spell embrasseur. Still cant, as Herb Levy will
tell you. But right now I am listening to a CD stuck in my Mac, Pharoah
Sanders playing heartbreaking standard ballads like Coltrane once did, an
eerie imitation.

I was never going to marry you in June anyway, and here's some news for
you: I got that ring off a dead guy in the dust in front of the Rexall. I
was just trying to make you feel good, show yr ring finger off to all your
co-workers. Us long-jawed types cant be tied down, got riding to do. Today
I rode an elegy in 55 lines flat, about a guy died in Rome.

Anyway, I been thinking about yr comments on my comments re the Leone
movies, remember the shots from the floor, camera shots that is? And I am
saying you were partly righter than I was partly righter and I'm gettin' in
my cayuse and rightin' out of this town ride now.

Actually, I wasn't thinking of *anyone* who posts on this list, simply
because I don't know any of you personally: I haven't gotten drunk with
you and heard you complain. I haven't met you at a conference and seen
you turn pale when you imagine another writer is being praised at your
expense. When I talk about "certain writers," I mean writers whom I know
and disagree with ideologically but don't wish to berate in a public (or
for that matter, in any) forum.

So, to recap: No one here need wonder if I'm talking about *her/m*, or

Kent,

That wasn't me who was generously praising Tom Meyer, although it
certainly could have been. My little zine in the 70s, Tottel's, was
publishing Tom even before Jonathon Williams ever met him. In fact,
Tottel's was one of the few publications to print an excerpt from Tom's
800+ page poem called Technographic Typography, written more or less
continuously while he was a student at Bard (or was it Tufts?). Anyway,
Tom abandoned the project and I think may even have discarded the text,
but I've always liked it, both the idea and the act of it, and am
wondering if anybody on the list knows of a better source of more of it
(I know, for example, that some other little mags ran excerpts, but
cannot remember which ones or where).

Rob,

I recall George Stanley once (in 1967) arguing that a poet was the only

admit to sharing that bias.

I would hardly characterize my reaction as a flame, punctuation-wise or

This is indeed a big issue, the differing centers of gravity of romanticism
& modernism respectively.  A discussion beyond my capacity, but I tried
to get at it tangentially in essay in latest Witz on the Hoboken
Russ-American conference.  I tried to suggest (provocatively & probably
mistakenly, I admit) that Russian postmodernism, as exhibited in
current poetry, differs from American - is really a pre-modernism -
at the core of which is Mandelstamian or Chaadevian (Chaadev - 19th
cent. Russian writer) concept of "moral freedom".  The idea is
that the Person, in a moral sense, exists as a kind of absolute,
in a theological frame (not as "ego") - analogous to the way
the icon was considered a real manifestation or extension of a divine
being.

The idea is that the Romantic autonomous self & the Modernist autotelic
art-form are incomplete.  Western postmodernism "proved" this in a
negative, deconstructive form; Russian "postmodernism" exhibits a
(sublimated, metaphorized) return to a metaphysical or religious
conception of the self-art continuum.

I also tried to suggest (again, a provocative reduction) that this
conceptual basis is reflected in the differing aesthetics of Russian
& American poetry.  Russian poetry, as I heard it performed in
Hoboken, exhibits a kind of organic "finality" - an expression
of the premodern humanist form of an Absolute - a formation
not visible in current American poetry (at least not in the same way).

Now I know there's a comic side to these tendentious formulations -
so I just throw them out to you listees, knowing there were several
of you at the Hoboken wing-ding who may have a very different take
on these issues - & also to draw attention to the latest Witz which
has some other neat stuff in it...  - He"n"ry Gould

Tottel's was a great magazine. But in this context it also makes me remember
that, in the 70's, in Tottel's, in Stations, in Paper Air, and in several
other magazines, typographical experiments/concrete poetry/visual
poetry/sound poetry/etc. seemed to be very much a part of what was going on,
and I originally saw language poetry as part of a context including such
work. Yet it didn't seem long before language poetry seemed quite separate
from such visual and multimedia experimentation (I know, that word is very
problematic). In later magazines like Temblor, o-blek, and many others, one
almost never saw visual work, scores of sound work, and the like. Is this a
split? Can you think of any reasons for this split?

I find this whole thread, and especially the following

"Silliman's punctuation-flame is an instance of classic bad nettiquite"

really disconcerting and wonder if I am alone in this. To me Ron Silliman
began the thread in a way requiring no emoticon to communicate that while he
was using Rob's email misquoting of the title of Z's poem/book to introduce
a little (literally) subject, he intended neither insult to Rob nor to be
making a big deal intellectually of Rob's part in the subject. He titled his
post "Picky, Picky, Picky" -- do we need an emoticon to understand this
framing device?

I was shocked by the strength of Rob's response, leading me to ask myself
whether there might be some subtext here or else something I missed. If
there is a flame here, and I don't think there is, it is I'm afraid on Rob's
not Ron's part. Yet Rob's is one of the minds in this listserv I've most
enjoyed and he is one of the people whose posts I look for and always read.
And Ron is a very close friend; perhaps our friendship causes me to misread
what is going on here.

As to the interpretation of the title _"A"_ (and I sure as hell hope I've
got that write) it is obvious that the shorter and/or more fragmentary the
item, the more interpretation it both requires and invites. No one has
mentioned, for example, that A is the note to which musicians most often
tune their instruments (usually 440 cycles/second) or that semanticization
of letters is a classic mystic practice (especially - prob. my prejudice - a
Jewish mystical practice, viz. Book of Bahir, etc.). Or that A stands well
for a beginning. Or whether there's a musical connotation to the key of A,
or that A says Not The, or that it points up, or that the quotation marks
may indicate a sung note, or a sung word, or the play of a sung word being
the name of the note sung, or... I could fill pages with this stuff, and it
is *all* relevant: that is, it might be if someone can make it be.

Riffs relate to music; some of you remember the concept of a blowing session
from the fifties; I seem to be on music. A critic would say about one of
these dates in a Bluenote or Prestige studio that it's "not just another
blowing session." The critic meant that there was an inter-process
communication (now I'm on programming) among the musicians. Each wasn't just
"blowing his horn," taking off from the others, but rather some ensemble
"mind" ensued.

That sounds good.

Hi Tom -

"'A' noir..."  -n'est-ce pas?  Especially "noir" re Rod. Not the first guy to
lately go off the deep end! Seasonal disorder?

I do think it's good that you bring up his antagonism in the context of this
list. I suspect there are power subtexts. Ron - either by statement or
silence - in my limited experience of this list appears to assume and play
"the grand arbiter" without much humility -- and that's not to say he's
without knowlege, intellegence, sometimes humor etc. However Ron's approach
can come off as a policing  ploy designed to separate the grown fish from the
minnows - proven poets from the new ones, already legitimate or emerging
critics - as for example those who might provide public validation for the
work of of poets he considers interesting - as different from those
"non-professionals" or poets and academics offering casual opinions. This
acitivity on the part of Ron is not necessarily a bad function given the
diversity and open subscription nature of this list. I think its natural that
someone(s) will move into the list to create a hierarchy within the on-going
process. At it's best it creates healthy arguments.
AT its worst - with dips into cheap shots - I find the process can create
episodes where some well meaning person will feel like they're being pigged
on for somebody else's advantage.

But the Zukofsky spelling thing  -- I remember--  can be provocative. When he
died (1977?), the St. Marks's Poetry Project Newletter mispelled his name in
the "in memoriaum" piece, and I recollect that Creeley wrote a very harsh
letter to the editors- arguning (as I recall) that the the the St. Marks
folks had taken the man and his work in vain - implying (I believe) that
editors had neither read or given Zukofsky proper respect while he was alive.
In a public respect, it seemed so Un-Creeley. I certainly couldn't figure out
why he was so harsh.

Comparitively, Ron, as you point out, with this mispelling of Z's name was
quite light fingered: the gentle, ironic school Master (Marm?) - gatekeeper
with humor?

Unless it's a personality conflict of another order, I commend you
encouraging Rod - especially given your respect for his critical mind -  to
be more out with a more articulate rendering of the source of his anger re
Ron. Maybe there will be something fruitful here.

As you point to the good example of the improvisatory phenomenon that happens
among muscians - I find this list most exciting when an ensemble of various
users (players) takes a particular thread and gets a Mind going that takes it
somewhere Fresh.

 Cheers

Subject:      Russian postmodernism

Henry:

Just saw your interesting note on differences between Russian and
American postmodernist poetry, though I've missed out on the
background discussion you allude to in "winter or not to winter." A
key writer to consult on the matter of Russian postmodernism
and its poetries is Mikhail Epstein, who
published the book, as they say, on the subject: After the Future:
The Paradoxes of Postmodernism & Contemporary Russian Culture.
Epstein also authored an extensive Afterword to Third Wave: The New
Russian Poetry, an anthology I edited back in 1992, and which I heard
was available at the Hoboken conference. Epstein's After the Future
contains all kinds of fascinating stuff, including three or four
essays that focus on the Russian poetic avant-garde. As you possibly
already know, Epstein divides the "postmodern" Russian poetry scene
into different aesthetic/philosophical tendencies, the two most
general of which are "Conceptualism" and "Metarealism." In reading
your "provocatively reductive" formulations, it struck me that your
sense of a "return to a metaphysical or religious conception of the
self-art continuum" would be much more applicable to the second group
than the first: proposals of "organic finality" or expressions of
"humanist forms of an Absolute" do often appear in Conceptualist
writing, but when they do they are intended quite negatively and most
usually in the spirit of parody.

But I'm offering this without having read your article, which I'm
going to order from Whiz. And I'm taking the liberty of sending your
post to Mikhail Epstein, who would, by the way, be very pleased to
hear from you and others interested in contemporary Russian culture
and poetics. Epstein's e-mail is russmne@emory.edu.

I cannot see any alternative to agreeing with Ron. The question was never,
as far as I could see, a question of punctuation. It was a question of
getting a title right. Zuk was not sloppy about titles, as I think should
be apparent in the strangeness of nearly all his titles.

I mean, we dont call his late book _80 Flowers. More or Less_

what was going on, and I originally saw language poetry as part of a
context including such work. Yet it didn't seem long before language
poetry seemed quite separate from such visual and multimedia
experimentation (I know, that word is very problematic). In later
magazines like Temblor, o-blek, and many others, one almost never saw
visual work, scores of sound work, and the like. Is this a split? Can
you think of any reasons for this split?

>charles

My own sense (wholly subjective and biased) is that it came down to a
sense of "what is language?" and an abiding interest in _that._ When I
think of larger collections of visual poetry (e.g., Mary Ellen Solt's
anthology, say), I was always struck at how *static* the work seemed to
me. There were always exceptions, notably among the island poets with
that "f" phoneme up front (Furnival, Finlay, Phillips) that Charles
Hocking likes to note is one of the "recent" sounds added to the
vocabulary (it requires teeth shaped by agriculture), but it was that
they seemed exceptions that made it all the more apparent.

Similarly, sound projects had their own problematics (esp. if you are
looking to the page for evidence) tho the steves (Benson, McCaffery)
did some amazing things in that regard, the latter with all his other
horsepeople.

But I recall some performances that Steve McC did in Berkeley many
years back (somewhere in the 1981-85 time frame, based on where I was
living at the time) that required him to keep a hog's head in my
refrigerator for a day or so. The pieces were very effective as theater
and thus controversial for that aspect alone. The question was: did
that effective theater draw one's attention *away* from (1) "the work"
or (2) "the language"? Much discussion on all sides of that one, but
you can see the preconceptions about what The Work was.

This would be a good question to pose to Steve or to Johanna Drucker,
another person who I think has gotten quite a bit underappreciated by
my own generation, precisely because her attention has not been
linguistic, as such, but around and beyond. Or Steve Benson.

"But the Zukofsky spelling thing  -- I remember--  can be provocative.
When he died (1977?), the St. Marks's Poetry Project Newletter
mispelled his name in the "in memoriaum" piece, and I recollect that
Creeley wrote a very harsh letter to the editors- arguning (as I
recall) that the the the St. Marks folks had taken the man and his work
in vain - implying (I believe) that editors had neither read or given
Zukofsky proper respect while he was alive. In a public respect, it
seemed so Un-Creeley. I certainly couldn't figure out why he was so
harsh."  Steve Vincent

Bob's on the list and can certainly speak for himself, but possibly it
was because of the experience of having his own name misspelled on
every damn page of David Ossman's The Sullen Art -- Greeley in the
footer. Or perhaps he thought it a sign that they would run a memorial
without even looking at the work closely enough to see the name?

while i'd agree with you that there are "power subtexts" at work (there
are *always* "power subtexts" at work... [oops, that must be leftover frm
the politics/poetics thread]), i think it's a mistake to  credit or blame
Ron for assuming his role, whatever it is--the list as a whole creates
its dynamic, by patterns ov response & silence, for all ov it's members,
and no individual determines his/her own position in the pecking order
without our aid (& pecking order is too linear & 2dimensional than what
i mean...).

&, as i mention as often as i can, this is not an "open" list:

>IMPORTANT: This list is confidential. You should not publicly mention its

I guess, Henry, it depends on how you think of--yikes, dare I say
it--"postmodernism". Do you consider Olson to have written under this
rubric, and those who continue to labour quietly in that vein? I think
of Robin Blaser's decription of Jack Clarke's work as stepping around
the "pile-up of postisms", of being "just plain after the modern and
at work", or words to that effect. Certainly Olson's push was toward
what you are calling the "pre-modern" I think, and Clarke's work, as
it carries that work "forward" never forgets that for a moment.
Clarke's much on my mind because I'm just finishing the production of _In
the Analogy, Books 1-7_ which will soon be released.

I don't know about the "Absolute". Isn't that some kind of vodka?
Maybe that explains what the Rooskies are up to.

Shocked to hear Nadav Savio, Mario's son, quoting from his father's
letters on C-SPAN late last night (in a larger tribute to MS).  These
sweet bits were full of poets and poems--Dante, Stevens, "Sunday
Morning," of all things.  Proving we know so little of the purpose of
poetry, or when it speaks, or to whom.  Nadav quoted a few last lines
himself, from Hopkins, in saying goodbye to his father, but by then I
was really too astonished to note which ones.

Oy, I can see a huge brouhaha coming. I could not agree less with this
statement by my old friend Steve about my other old friend Ron.

Actually, I thought *I* was the Grand Arbiter. Perhaps I'll tell a story on
myself, and it will deflect the future.

A few of you on this list -- not many, lucky you -- are old enough that the
subject of "aging" no longer evokes wine or cheese but one's own body or
what's left of it. At least those will probably have noticed a recent spate
of articles in the mass media on "anti-aging" technologies. In particular,
it was the cover story in a recent Newsweek which I browsed at my local
Crown Books while sipping my daily 2pm Starbuck's capuccino which gon' carry
me to my grave.

According to the article, some men my age are injecting growth hormone,
sticking testosterone patches on their skin or ingesting a substance called
DHEA which latter is an extract of the adrenal gland (whose I did not
notice). All of these increase the angle of your erection (I swear that is
what the article said), thicken your hair and in general do all manner of
fab stuff... according to the Newsweek cover story.

As I walked to my car, chuckling at this only-in-America confab of vanity,
utopianism and puritanism (age is a disease), I passed a "health food"
store, and in its window were a biiig sign: "DHEA -- mother of all hormones:
buy it here." Looking both ways, to make sure no contemporary espied me, I
dashed in and bought myself a jar of DHEA pills. What the hell, right? I've
tried a lot stronger stuff, right? I've *lived on* stronger stuff, right?

I began to give myself a dose in the lower range of what was recommended on
the small print on the jar which I was able to read with the aid of my
dimestore reading glasses which I have to replace quarterly with the next
stronger set.

Subtly, then not so subtly after a few days, I did experience a change. I
found it impossible to sit at a red light without cursing it, I found myself
repeatedly disagreeing with almost everyone around me, I had a number of
blow-out yelling sessions with business associates, I flamed left and right,
and I found a reason at least 3 times daily to have a fight with Beth
Joselow to whom I'm married. Nearly everything I read seemed stupid. Etc.

It took me about three weeks to connect the DHEA with these experiences.
Wiping the foam from my mouth one evening I threw the jar in a waste basket.
In about 5 days I was back to my previous state. (Alas, I forgot to measure
any angles, so no datapoints on really significant issues emerge from my
experiment on myself)

A week or so after this, I was on the phone with another old friend who now
lives in L.A., Ethan Feinsod, whom I've known for many decades. In detail, I
recounted to Ethan my experiment with DHEA and its effect on me, namely to
render me an intolerably arrogant asshole. "Oh my God," Ethan replied, "that
stuff is the fountain of youth! I'm going to run out and get some. That's
*exactly* what you were like in your twenties."

Lets not interpret each other's intentions in ways that render master/slave
narratives on this list. It's really not a likely story, and it creates heat
not light. Much light, as we know, still needs unveiling. Poetry, to use a
parable I've often evoked, is an absolute monarchy in which everyone is
king. No subjects.

Ron,

You make some very stimulating points.  It seems to me though that the "what is
language?" question as you characterize it is a recipe for exclusion.  It's a
linguistic question taken up as a literary question, but one that only
structural linguistics is allowed to answer.  In answering it agrees, more or
less, that language, and then literature, is some kind of text, which an
aesthetic can then demonstrate.  Once characterized in this manner, as you point
out, other forms would seem "away from the work" etc. since they would appear to
be formally and materially other, not literary, not of language etc.

So for me, I would say, yes Language poetry does in fact effect a split.
Whether we need the split or not, I don't know.

As they say in this part of the world, "Bonnes Fetes."

Everybody has a personality, nobody has a police -- at least not here. I too
am a friend of Ron's, and I think he's a very smart guy with strong
opinions. But I don't hear him policing anybody. In fact I think he likes a
good discussion, even argument, as well as the next list-server.

re: simon shuchat's and stephen vincent's posts on Midwinter Day-- the
journal kept by Lewis Warsh and Bernadette Mayer while they lived in
Massachusetts was called "Piece of Cake" and it was never published, partly
because of the personal nature of the work (references to friendships,
etc.)-- it definitely deals with the domestic, but not specifically with
Bernadette's pregnancy-- it's a text where Bernadette and Lewis alternate
journal entries.  The work that Lewis was doing at that time was not
exactly a parallel experience text-- he was writing the novel Agnes and
Sally (Fiction Collective publication), parts of which take place in a
small New England town.  His book of poems Information from the Surface of
Venus also addresses that time period (published by United Artists books).

Thought I'd tender the following as a Xmas "gift" to all on the list.  Enjoy.

"It is clear to all -- enjoyment bears witness to this -- that a good poem
is one where nothing is left over, where all the phonemic material in use is
consumed; and that, on the other hand, a bad poem (or 'not-poetry-at-all')
is one where there is a remainder, where not every significant phoneme,
diphoneme, syllable or term has been seized by its double, where not every
term has been volatilised and consumed in a rigorous reciprocity (or
antagonism), as in primitive gift exchange, where we feel the weight of the
remainder that has not found its corresponding term, nor therefore its death
and absolution, which has not been successfully exchanged in the very
operation of the text:  it is in proportion to this residue that we know
that  a poem is bad, that it is the slag of discourse, something which has
not exploded, which has been neither lost nor consumed in the festival of
reversible speech."

. . .

" . . . it is clear that the unrestrained freedom to use phonemes in
unlimited number for purposes of expression, without the reverse processes
of cancellation, expiation, reabsorbtion or destruction (it does not matter
which term), is radically opposed by the simple law announced by Saussure,
that in poetry a vowel, a consonant or a syllable cannot be uttered without
being doubled, that is to say, somehow exorcised, without fulfilling itself
in the repetition that cancels it."

Subject:      excursus on Johanna Drucker
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

As someone who's been immersed in Johanna Drucker's work for a while now, I
think I understand what Ron Silliman means when he says that, "her attention
has not been linguistic, as such, but around and beyond." Still, I'm not
sure that this is accurate even at the level on which intends it, which I
take to be something like, "the focus of the work is not the play of
language on language but rather language's correspondence with other textual
elements (primarily visual and tactile)."

Drucker has, however, written several prose works including _Italy_ and most
recently the novella _Dark Decade_. Both are illustrated, it is true, but
here I think the illustrations are largely illustrative, and the text is
directed toward language as a written event; this is true of _DD_
especially, which seems to me very much about recuperating language from the
dominant cants of media-speak.

I would also argue that Drucker's _corpus_ more generally is less about
circumventing the linguistic, navigating "around and beyond" it, then it is
about exposing the means, both historical and phenomenological, by which
language comes to be seperated from its visible and material forms. In _The
Word Made Flesh_, for example, the text generates considerable linguistic
energy from the various syntactical arrangements culled from its spatial
array of letter-forms; even, I would argue, to the extent of a plot, in some
very rudimentary sense. Or to take an example of another sort, in the
_Visible Word_, one of her critical studies, Drucker identifies 19th century
academic philology as the most dramatic instance of language's artificial
separation from its visual forms, and traces the rise of that discipline to
the role of the Rosetta stone in deciphering the Egyptian hieroglyphics, an
achievement which rendered the visual and visible forms of the hieroglyphics
irrelevant as they were no longer _seen_ as potential keys to linguistic
meaning.

I do agree with Ron, however, that Drucker is underappreciated; certainly in
mainstream academic circles she's quite unknown, or known only for her
several (impeccable) critical studies. I've found only a handful of
secondary studies of the book art and other creative productions, including
several by Perloff. I'd be grateful to hear from others with an interest in
this work.

This is "Welcome to Love", from Timeless, which is a Dutch company,

Very smooth; a conscious imitation of Coltrane's album, "Ballads."

I have had a few reservations abt Pharoah, but he was a gink I liked right
off; there was a bad time when he was playing Krishna-meditation-coriander
stuff and getting played on the rock stations around 1970. But I heard him
at Slugs' around then and he was great. Earlier he was moonlighting in
Jersey as a Latino music player and even as a rock pl;ayer, and I have some
of that stuff, only for documentation.

But he is one of the great young ones, with Archie Shepp, etc. of the
sixties who got "raised" to a big label, mainly ABC.

I have to concur. I have never met Ron, as far as I know, unless he was the
kid with the yoyo behind Robt Duncan on 20th, I saw one day in 1962.

But I like his not really abrasive wit here. And I loved that flaming gag
that was going on abt him last year, and I think he did too.

Christine, I had a dream that we were driving through
Tonides and in
Tonides we almost divided against the fast car, that
Tonides was a why, McCarthy formalism, that if
Tonides, then _come_ else _go,_ or that if
Tonides, everything's beautiful and in this
Tonides dream, I asked only "whose decision," for
Tonides' beautiful impunity, where there were spined

and other plants to wear brown aureoles
upon the brow, the hair, the shirt, the oracular arm
for luck of whatever sort Tonides might bring,

that would be _investigative poetry_, published by city lights in 1976
(a 40 pg. chapbook, my copy sez $2.00).  the cataloging info includes:
"a lecture prepared for the Visiting Spontaneous Poetics Acadamy of the
Naropa Institute in Boulder, Colo., in the summer of 1975"... [quick run
to partner's bookshelf downstairs]...  a similarly titled essay also appears
in Vol. 2 of _talking poetics from naropa institute_, tho i'm not sure if
that version is th same...   greetings, dan.

Kent,
I've read "Third Wave" - belated congratulations on a remarkable anthology.
I found M. Epstein's essay there very interesting & will take a look at
the book you mention.  Although I was a little skeptical of the almost
too-neat categories he developed for contemporary Russian poetry,
the parallels he drew between current movements & the various strands of
early 20th-cent writing (Acmeism, Futurism) are intriguing.

As I tried to make clear in the first post, I'm not really qualified to
get into these subjects in much depth, not knowing Russian & being only
slightly informed about a few poets.  I was responding in particular
to the poets I heard & met at Hoboken, where I was struck by the variance
between US & Russian approaches.  But as "Third Wave" demonstrates,
there has been a lot of crossover & interaction in the 90s between
some "experimental" US poets (some of whom were at Hoboken) & SOME
varieties of Russian practice.  The "provocative" (tendentious?) aspect
of my first post involved not so much my comments on the variance
in practice between the 2 poetries, as in the way I tried to link
that with even larger & murkier subjects (romanticism, modernism,
postmodernism ...miasmaism...) - Henry Gould

I can only display my ignorance by responding - I know there are others
here that can enlighten.  It could be & has been argued that Olson
inaugurated "postmodern" US poetry.  In my own clumsy sense of these
"isms", this is unclear.  i.e.: Modernism as a movement in the arts replaced
Romanticism (& Victorian post-Romanticism) in the following way:
the Romantic Absolute (its version of God) was displaced onto the
artwork itself.  The artwork became a kind of Janus-faced idol/ideal
THROUGH WHICH & by means of which any conclusions could be drawn -
the artwork became the scripture of the extra-literary or extra-artistic
cosmos.  POSTMODERNISM (as the critics have defined it?) debunked this
last idolatry.  The artwork was only self-referential, has no intrinsic
connection to exterior world.

Olson, it seems to me, critiqued the great works of modernist poetry
(Pound in particular) as blinkered by aestheticism.  The "poem"
was a life-process, more a documentary "script" than scripture.
In a lot of ways it seems to me he was not opposing modernism as
"postmodernist" critics do, but building on it - building on Pound
by trying to load MORE self, more history, more of the unprocessed
"real" into his epic.  & maybe this is, as you say, "pre-modern" too.

On vodka & the Absolute - see F. Dostoevsky's novella "Seeing Double"
on the "morning after" and the predicament of the existential hangover.

Susan,
this may not be exactly what you're looking for, but Lee Edelman wrote
an interesting book on Hart Crane's rhetoric called _Transmemberment of
Song_ (Stanford UP, 1987. isbn 0804714134).  She analyses his work through
the lens of a set of tropes characterized by intentional distortions -
links it up to the engineering theme in The Bridge (literally twisting
it into shape).  Can't recall the name of the major trope.... sheesh...
help, anybody?  It's a trope of exaggeration, distortion, etc.  & while
you're onto Crane, Paul Giles's book "Hart Crane: the Contexts of the
Bridge" (Cambridge UP, 1986) has an incredible run-through on double
meanings & puns in The Bridge.

"Cheerios", Henry

Oh yeah! I remember that time. Town got full of L= poets, and someone gave
me hell for PC reasons I think in a dictated poem I read at the time. I
think it was probably Bruce Andrews. One of the locals had to be stopped
from popping him one at a party at Gladys Hindmarch's.

Hey, you mean Mandel is out of his twenties?

Oh, by the way, Ron, I have been meaning (in a friendly way, absolutely) to
point out that in that useful early book _The New Sentence_, Harry
Mathews's name is spelled wrong on p. 14 and in the index.

Glad I got some e-mail this Boxing Day. It is record cold outside, about 10
below or worse (I dont know what that is in US degrees), and if I didnt
have e-mail to do (called enamel in French, you'll remember) I would have
to go to the store and get cigarettes for most of the women in the house.

Nice to hear from ya. If you see Bromige tell him I will answer his letter
when I figure out what he was saying. He answers his e-mail only when he
has been in his cups.

Also this. The Modernists all seemed to be finding some way to wrap the
classical world into our sensibilities. But Olson, no Greek, had not
th'advantage, demanded something that went back before that, the famous
Pleistocene.

Yep, I often read (in the most surprising places) the use of "fulsome" to
mean large, encompassing, complete, etc.

Am reading Russian critic Mikhail Epstein's new book, _After the Future_
& would recommend it highly.  Among other things it has a revised version
of the essay that appeared in the _Third Wave_ anthology of new Russ poetry
Kent Johnson mentioned.  In preface he talks about how every interesting
"advance" in cultural history is always a step back & forward at same time -
that culture is actually a kind of "machine" for transcending clock-time.
& in "postmodern times we go further & further back into archaic & further
into techno-future, there is actually no "present" - & that this has
ALWAYS been a peculiar characteristic of Russia - past & future at loggerheads
with no livable "present".  Epstein's _Third Wave_ essay, with its analysis
of poetic rival networks in Russia & its opposition of "culture" to the
social binds of ideology (power) & the ideological binds of society - could
be compared interestingly with Jeff Hansen's Witz essay ("Anarchy & Culture").
They both have positive things to say about literary schools & networks
as necessary & vitalizing influences - but the word "culture" has opposite
positive/negative value.  For Epstein, "culture" is the hopeful,
transcendent, life-giving force, challenging the lowest common denominators
of cliche.  For Jeff, "culture" is the opposite - stands for convention.
"Anarchy" is closer to Epstein's "culture" (though Jeff makes clear it's
all on a continuum between the 2).

Russ & US have always had VERY different responses to "tradition".  I have
felt for a long time that US poets could learn something specifically about
poetics & poetic technique from the Russians.  Across the spectrum of their
"schools" (as Epstein classifies them), there is a different expression
of the concept, the conceptual, the allusion, the traditional.  How
is it different?  In a nutshell: western poetries often seem like a wasp in
a bottle - techniques oppose techniques, all within the closed circle
of craft.  The Russians, acclimatized to over-conceptualization of
EVERYTHING, have "naturalized" poetry to the general conversation of
culture at large.  Concept, tradition, technique, poetry, culture, &
history have a closer organic knit in which everything relates to everything
else.

This may be a myth - balderdash - but I believe it's productive balderdash.
An infusion of the "Russian" might actually help integrate concept/
allusion/tradition/reference/style.  I know this is all very artificial -
but I'm talking about getting beyond, say, the simple binary oppositions
displayed in talk about langpo "opacity" and (apex of the M, for ex.)
"transparency" of reference. (I also realize that these are trivial
side issues for most "working" poets.  Oh well.  I'm woikin' too.)

Ron & Kent,

        t'was me mentioned Tom Meyer & glad to learn about the New Orleans
Review. Will look it up. Ron -- it was Bard College, indeed, though I
believe Jonathan came before Tottel's, as Tom met JW at Bard in the late
sixties, if memory serves. I remember that when I met Tom, Sept/Oct '67
at Bard, he had already been working on the Technographical Typography
in Process for a year or so. When he showed me the black spring binders
with that work, I was in total awe: my still-European concept of
small/absolute poetic gestures a la Rimbaud & Mallarm� was blown away by
this strange american praxis of writing daily for a set number of hours
on that era's most awesome machina, the IBM golfball. If  later on he
abandoned that text, I don't think he discarded it -- I seem to remember
that the last time we spoke he was rather fond of that early work.  The
two little mags in which he published extracts from TT( besides
Tottle's) that readily come to mind were The Lampeter Muse &
Caterpillar.  BTW a good essay (& there are very few anyway) on Meyer's
work bic Mottram came out in 1985 from Reality Studios as RS Occasional
Paper # 2 . Ken Edwards could tell us if it's still in print. The latest
works by Tom I have seen are "Fourteen Poems" (1989, French Broad Press)
& "Tom Writes This For Robert To Read" (n/d St. Lazaire Press -- tho I
know it is also from the late eighties).

Yeah, it's fun, eh? Alone in the candy store . . .

I, personally, Henry, would have an easier time with your proposal if
it were more specific in terms of the poetries it's addressing. I
suspect, from what you've written here, that underneath this is an
identification of the "postmodern" with a very narrow range of
writing, and so I find myself mentally marshalling counter-examples:
Dorn and the mock-epic, Olson and Clarke and the epic, any number of
writers and the sonnet sequence, etc. But that's the trouble with this
vocabulary and its slippery signifiers (altho I just love slippery
signifiers, especially in the bath).

For Olson on the premodern, by the way, reread "The Gate at the
Center".

None of this is to argue with your assessment of the Russians, only to
complicate the binary you've set up between the Rooskies and the
Americans. I'm looking forward to reading your Witz essay for more info.

Yes, I'm being intellectually irresponsible as well as obtuse (you didn't
say that, but I'm saying it).  One, by trying to project a set of private
& personal predilections as if it were reasonably thought-out (i.e. my
overly narrow & boundless admiration for a few Russ. poets, not even
contemporary, is translated into a "program").  One might as well say,
how about an infusion of "French"?  "Malaysian"?

Confession is the best defense.  But I will persist in my folly.
The current, productive state of Russian poetry can act like a mirror.
Distance simplifies.  (Why simplify?  I'm always oversimplifying.
Because I'm looking for a metapoetics - an alternative to the metapoetics
of Language Poetry, and that of the NY "school", and that of the loosely
so-called Olson-Oppen-Creeley-BlckMtn et al. "school", and all the other
schools.  I'm starting my own school.)

& the closest poetics to what I'm looking for - in my own work & any
affinities thereby - is found among the Russ. poets categorized by
Mikhail Epstein as "metarealists" (or somewhere between them & his
neo-Acmeists (my own term).

I don't have the energy to replay all that Epstein says about them, or
their counterparts the Conceptual poets & the neo-Acmeists.  Suffice it
to say they do not deny East-Western spiritual/cultural tradition, but
look for its re-embodiment & re-integration in the interstices of the
ordinary present-day - which is actually NOT ordinary, ie. "reality"
is multidimensional - much as in CS Peirce, the unseen, the general, the
abstract, the spiritual, are also real & integrated with the material.
They discover the re-embodiment of the mythical & eternal.  Epstein
relates the rhetorical trope of "metabole" to them - what he calls
a third mediating trope after metaphor & metonymy.  It's not similarity
by likeness or contiguity - it's unity - oneness - commonality.
The forest is not LIKE a production factory: in the poetry they
are REALLY one. Metabole : metabolism.  (but shd check the original.)

What attracts me to this group of poets?  Conceptual art, either Russian
or western - which is GREAT & which subsumes a lot of what's going on in
experimental writing - intellectually demystifies & cleanses & activates
& ironizes & defamiliarizes - & this is the right role, as Epstein
points out, for self-conscious cultural work.  But it does not INTEGRATE.
I want a NEW poetry which finds the roots of world & perennial poetry -
which integrates the objective, the symbolic, the lyrical, the spiritual,
the mystical, the literary, the traditional, the mythical, the critical,
the ironic, the historical, the etc.  What allows a poetics like
that of the Russ. "metapoets" to integrate experience is the fact that
it is grounded in a foundation of philosophical realism - ie. the conceptual
is the real - which is not materialist but closer to the transcendental.
It is this grounding which allows the old to be re-lived, anew.
(Shd mention, though, that Epstein does argue for an "integral" element
in purely conceptual work - a kind of "negative theology" - as in the
chance operations with cliches & slogans of a Lev Rubinshtein, the repetitive
recital of which approaches a kind of humble/Buddhist emptying of verbal
deadness.)

Afterthought about the Mikhail Epstein book - it would be a misrepresentation
of his thinking to say he values the "metarealists" over the "conceptualists".
Far from it.  For one thing, Epstein closes with remarks about the continuum
of approaches - the "acmeists" of today - running between these 2 poles.
More importantly, he makes a strong case for avant-garde & conceptual art
as a truly "religious" expression - as opposed to worldly & conservative
traditionalism - in an apocalyptic, millenial age which dissolves tradition
along with the rest of the whole physical world.  He points to an
affinity between avant-garde anti-art & the tradition of the
iconoclastic, anti-establishment holy fool - a "poor art".

Any "new metapoetics" would have to show a more complete absorption &
reflection of these opposing tendencies (art & anti-art; beauty & "truth").

Subject:      Russians, Americans

Henry,

Parallels between Russia and "America" (or, more particularly, white
America) have to do with the fact that both states' cultures have
important European influences about which each feels uneasy (to say the
least), that their land base is vast, their history in this century
largely imperial, and that "state" each contains many national
minorities for whom there has been much bad history and bad
consciousness. The shear size of those land masses means, for example,
that SF is closer to Vladivostok than it is to NYC, so that any idea of
a cultural "center" for either nation is ultimately an impossibility
(an irony that appears lost on all cultural centralists, such as Bill
Bennett, not just on New Yorkers and Muscovites).

I agree with you on the need (even desparate need) for a "theory" (to
call it that) for writing that is, as you suggest, post-Language. What
would it entail? What would it need to address? I would think that the
functioning of society in an epoch in which capital has clearly not
just seized the state (it always did that) but has more or less now
transcended it as well. What does it mean to write in a post-state
capitalism?

All best,

Ron

The OED, which I recommend to all, and especially to Harold Bloom, has two
pre-Rosalind examples of falling in love (one of which is from Shakespeare),
to wit:


"1530 Palsgr. 544/2, I shall fall in love with her. 1591 Shaks. Two Gent. I.
ii. 2 Would'st thou then counsaile me to fall in loue?"

I suspect that the phrase derives from the French, but I don't have a good
enouggh French dictionary at hand to know for sure.

It's Bloom's MO to make extravagant and questionable statements. What does
he build on this one? And does anyone know who or what "Palsgr." stands for?

By the by, this is my first communication with the list, so welcome to me!

The Palsgr in question must be John Palsgrave, who wrote an early instructional
book on French grammar (dated in fact as 1530), so that the "falling in love"
bit is likely from that.  The work is apparently of some interest for what
it tells about English during that time -- as much, say, as the French side
of it.  So your French conjecture may have some connection.

Sorry to come in so late flogging this by now utterly dead horse yet again,
but I have a mea culpa, yes, to fess up.

At 04:52 PM 12/22/96 -0500, Rob Hardin wrote, in response to my own
intuitive leap that
>>Is it also worth noting that, _A_ or "A", the title is pronounced as a

well now. I have no authority, I must confess, save tapes of LZ reading the
opening line of "A" and my own pronunciation of it. But the opening line is
not, as you say (imply), the title. Mea culpa.
LZ hisself, when referring to individual sections of the poem, always indeed
pronounced it EH not UH. And I think the same goes for his mentions of the
poem's title.

But I like the point that schwa points to An rather than the rest of the
alphabet (but LZ also played with the notion that the poem runs A to Z [just
as Zinnia in _80_Flowers _runs Z to A]  and included an alphabet in "A"-23
[or was it 22? I can't remember, and am too lazy to go look).

It's  the isolate A what gets the stressed length. Somewhat along the lines
of Duncan's The as in Tree the as in nut?

I like LZ's ambiguous duplicitous or bipolar play of pronunciation here,
actually.

But I can't resist adding that in LZ's correspondence with Cid Corman, and I
seem to recall in his notebooks as well, he made extensive if not heavy
weather of the value of those quotes around the A as images of the horns on
the ox's head.

He too, of course, played extensively with the title, and indeed why not.
But it was for him (so far as I can tell) and certainly for me, "A". It's a
pretty good label for the poem.

dear mark weiss and jerry rothenberg--
thank you for your informational responses to the 'falling
in love' question---a phrase that no doubt means something different in
post-state capitalism.....
i wonder if the stock market will ever
               fall
               in love.....

The French connection via Palsgrave seems most likely, especially as "to
fall in love" is the literal translation of "tomber amoureux."

Reality is escape. The rusty junk
of fervent highways soothe the mind
into self-consoling slumber. The real
real is intimate, hard to find,
locked & released at once in thought,
beyond the touch of poignant imagery.

I don't know about that, but it "swoons" a lot on NPR.

I sometimes have thought that Zuk put the quotation marks around the A in
order to screw up those profs and others who are trying to keep track of
the idea that you refer to short works with "   " and to longer works with
italics. This being a longer work (!), profs etc will be curling their
toes.

I once title a book with a word you are supposed to put into italics, just
to see how people would indicate it in their reviews, etc. I cant remember
what happened.

I don't think I said it was a blinker - I was trying to characterize (in my
usual crude simple way) ONE aspect of Chas. Olson's view of Pound: that his
perspective was narrowed by a dependence on classical/Greek aesthetics -
that Olson himself was aiming for something more "primordial".  - HG

These are big questions, & I'd like the whole list to jump in here this
Monday morning & hep answer them.  I am still reading Epstein's AFTER
THE FUTURE - he's got a chapter on what he calls "transculture" which
he compares with multiculturalism in the west - also what he calls
"culturology" (which seems to be a subcategory of sociology or
anthropology focusing on "culture" as a unitary phenomenon).  I'm
just beginning to glance into these sections of the book - but he seems
to have an optimism directly counter to that new book by historian
Samuel Huntington which is getting a lot of play right now - can't
think of the title - which warns of coming wars between "civilizations"
& cultures rather than states...

These issues are most certainly pertinent to poetics.  I'm not so sure
we desperately need another global theory of writing, however.  Well,
it would probably be interesting - but MORE interesting to me is a
narrower focus on poetry.  I'd like to help promote a new "school"
of poetry.  What makes Black Mountain & the objectivists & the Language
"school" & the NY "school" interesting is that it's a messy combination
of theory (more or less) with real distinctive practice.  The practice
preceded & underwrote the PR (& theory).

The Providence School of poetry would be clustered not so much in a place
as in a worldview - metaphysics prior to language.  Cosmic order as
a hypothesis underlying human freedom/disorder.  Would differentiate
itself from other poetries, not devalue them (would draw from them).
Would draw from philosophical sources in CS Peirce & David Bohm to
propose an "integral" poetry & a "human" poetry.  Would draw from
both Russian metarealism & acmeism (as NY school, in an antithetical
way, draws from surrealism & French poetry) the same philosophical
grounding found in Peirce & Bohm - that reality is complex, real,
& human/metaphysical - a metalanguage of signs, not a reductive
relativistic "text".  In this sense the Providence School is "serious"
where NY School is "surreal"; the Providence School is "realist"
(there are "real general intellectual phenomena") where the Language
School is "nominalist".  The Providence School is responsive to tradition
in both poetry & philosophy where other schools are oppositional.
This is because the Prov School accepts new interpretations of humanism
which are rejected by postmodernism.  The world of medieval, renaissance
& baroque poetry is not rejected on behalf of archaic or futuristic
enthusiasms - it is absorbed.
The serious complexity underwriting the Providence School is, however,
a thousand times closer to Objectivists, Blck Mtn, Language, NY School,
than it is to the bland prose-as-poetry lyrical meditations of
"mainstream" US poetry. Carl Rakosi's interview in the latest APR would
be a good intro to a ground base of agreements with the Prov school &
a jumping-off place.  Rakosi rejects both mainstream lyricism & surrealism;
he criticizes (while honoring) language poetry as a "dehumanization" of
speech.  He characterizes Objectivism in a negative way - as a cleaning
out of sentimentality & phony lyricism & dead cliche.  For the Prov
School this is a good start - but its philosophical leanings aim for
wider correspondences between concepts, traditions, & forms. Rakosi
also describes the poems of his own he likes as successful integrations
of idea, thought, feeling, style.  This is also a very good approach
to what I mentioned above as "integral poetry".  The Prov School draws
from David Bohm the concept of "wholeness" - that the universe exhibits
a marvelous infolding & unfolding of covalent & interwoven "wholenesses"
& that the integral work of art displays both wholeness & interconnection.
This may sound like a harking back to "organicism" but anyone who sets
up to form an aesthetic "school" must reckon with the issue of the art work
as an entity.

Finally - the Providence School might address some of the political issues
you raise, Ron, by way of its "universalism".  It's a humanism which is
inherently transcultural.  & I happen to believe that the world domination
of capital over state which you describe is temporary.  There is always
the potential, in the next century, for the rule of law to transform
social relations - both to establish a "level playing field" and to set
ground rules for livable & free communities.  This will take good
will, persistence, & vision - but I don't put it past the human race - that
is, it's achievable.

ps I know people will jump all over these valuations of both NY School

by restricting poetry to text-language they revealed the "silence"
or silencing at the core of mainstream rhetoric.  Also there is nothing
more humorously human & surrealistically expansive & lovely than
the NY school.  As I said above, the Prov School is based on a

As I understand it (in a very beginner way), toward the end of his life
CS Peirce was shaping his philosophy in a way that made ethics dependent
on aesthetics.  (Though this kind of bald statement is inherently
confusing.  Within the "architectonic" of his philosophy it was so;
in the ordinary conduct of life, of course, it was the reverse.)

How?  In the end, for Peirce, behavior & morality came to be based not
on human standards; human standards or ideals were themselves transformed
in their foundation by what Peirce (he was an inveterate word-coiner)
called "musement": he felt that persistent contemplation could lead
the mind naturally - by way of beauty (aesthetics) - to a kind of
"hypothetical", future-oriented faith in cosmic love, or a benign
divinity transcending human representations.

These speculations (unprovable or absurd to the "positivist" skeptic)
were so to speak tentative conclusions Peirce drew from his prior
perspectives on "realism" (the real existence of general classes of
things in a real physical/metaphysical cosmos - a coherence); his
belief that mind and nature were co-extensive, on a continuum (he
call it "synechism" - a kind of synthesis-through-a-continuum); &
his explorations (discoveries) in semiotics - his sense that reality
is a sign system, a metalanguage.    - Henry Gould

All right, then: what exactly is this 'divinity' but some part of nature
that is _not_ co-extensive with 'mind'? Some way of acknowledging that
although human life is part of nature, it is not _all_ of nature. Great.
But why assume this divinity is messianic? Or == why presume that the signs
are always/ever _legible_? (Hint: beauty ((meaning)).) I think this 'forest
of symbols' you're proposing is no more than another nominalism that wants
to see people where people are not. The kitsch of names. Or ==  we can

Not sure I follow you all the way here, Jordan - but I think another word
(maybe) coined by Peirce was "panentheism".  In pantheism, Nature = Mind.
In panentheism, Mind suffuses nature, but is not contained by it.  It
is what he calls a "Third" - the mediating, organizing, synthesizing
aspect of reality.  In other words, for Peirce it was just the reverse
of what you outline above in 1st 2 sentences.

On yr question "why assume this divinity is messianic" - I don't know
what "Peirce would say".  But maybe he would say that human self-
consciousness is also an aspect of this "thirdness" - that Mind is our
share of the divine image - & that the "just" mind also displays "heart",
an equability or equanimity or justice which is the essence of (moral)
beauty (& "on a continuum" with the physical order).

But though Peirce could be considered the ultimate New England "village
explainer", in NO WAY was he an expositor of certainties or final truths.
Peirce was the founder of both pragmatism & his own offshoot "pragmaticism",
a scientific practice based on notions of human fallibility, skepticism,
the need for experiment, & the search for common ground in results.
Divinity was a hypothetical beyond our representations.

Peirce organized everything in triads.  The logic of the mind by point, line
and plane.

What can we say about the triumvirate?  We can philosophize about divine love,
for the same reason the scholastics wrote theology & metaphysics, because it
can be fun, & soothing to reason about the order of things, but that's not
why I'm a poet or been a poet doggedly for a long time.  I was a 98-lb.
garden-variety agnostic (like we all are most of the time) until I experienced
the uncanny stroke of divine/human justice about 21 yrs ago.  I've written
about it more fully (but not completely) in GLASS OF GREEN TEA, the book
for Edwin Honig, so you'll have to go there for the story.  Let's just
say I was once a young proto-NY school poet-ephebe-as-Dr.-Faustus who
found himself shaking on his knees alone at midnight, when there came
(literally) a knock on the door.  I've spent most of my life trying to
understand that knock, and it doesn't reduce either to a mechanistic
universe or the free play of signifiers.

A CONVERSATION WITH MARTIN HEIDEGGER

An original poem in English by Van K. Brock
with a translation into German by Josef Pesch

Brock is founding editor of INTERNATIONAL QUARTERLY
and author of UNSPEAKABLE STRANGERS (Anhinga 1995),
Holocaust poems. Pesch is doing his "Habilitation"
project on Post-Apocalyptic North American Writing
at Albert-Ludwigs-Universitat Freiburg.

An early review of the Brock/Pesch/Heidegger issue:

"I just finished reading Van Brock's 'A Conversation with Martin Heidegger,'
and indeed, it made me 'blush down to my scars, / those old concealments....'
Reconciling my fondness for Heidegger's philosophical works with my distaste
for his personal politics has been a source of anxiety for me, and the grim
beauty and quasi-elegiac sadness of Brock's poem touched the nerve of that
long distress.  Yet the emotion of the poem centers not so much on mixed
feelings about a particular philosopher, but more on the broader and subtler
hypocrisies of our own lives and work.  Perhaps this reorienting constitutes
a step forward in the debates over Heidegger.  I don't know.  I do know that
only poetry -- in these times, at least -- could so affect my philosophy.
Thanks for putting good words on the wires.

Yeah, I didnt know who that was that played Doc H., but I liked that movie
a lot, better than the other one with whatsisname, the guy who played in
Water World. I loved that scene in which Doc H. and the scary bad guy are

Now that it's coming down to voting, I'll add mine.  I loved the whole
approach, Baudelaire with a six-shooter.  Another great line in the bar is
when some drunk asks him to play "Swanee River" or anything at all by
Stephen fuckin' Foster, which Doc refuses to do.  Asked a moment later what
he's playing, he responds: "It's a noctuhn ... you know ... Frederic
fucking Chopin."

While we're back on this subject, there's something special about this
story and "Tombstone" handles it really well.  When they're all out chasing
down the Clantons & get caught in a crossfire, one of the deputies asks Doc
why he's involved at all.  "Wyatt Earp is my friend," comes the response.
And the guy makes a joke -- "I have lots of friends", but Doc replies, "I
don't."  That's what I find interesting about this story, an American
legend, the sort of stories that went into Williams's _In the American
Grain_, the history you learn as a child, a great legend on that order, and
at the center of it a friendship.

So, when William Carlos Williams writes---
      "For if the poem set out to punish the wicked and
       reward the virtuous, it had better be on the basis of
       fulfilled love rather than unfulfilled" (SE 207)--
   do you (dear open question interlocutor) agree?
   What is the CONCEPTUAL distinction between grounding
   an action in fulfilled love vs. non-fulfilled love?
   On one level, I wanna say that WCW is being too restrictive...
   not denying the validity or the possibility of unfulfilled
   love as a basis for poetry, at least ocassionally, and
   kinda takes some of the "poetic license" (that allows
   for pain and despair, etc.) away--and is too ideal....
   but then i think that can't be the real point here
    because WHAT IS the difference between loves?
    IS THERE really such a thing as "fulfilled love"?
    And even if there IS such a thing (the love you take
    is equal to the love you make), is it possible WCW's
    really point here is more to question and challenge
    the assumption that poetry should even PRESUME to
    be apocalyptic--judgmental, to reward the virtuous
    (i.e. those who like me are frustrated--the whole
      christian guilt trip in which one is BETTER only to
      the extent one is self-sacrificing, or martyred, or
       BETTER only insofar as BITTER) and punish the wicked
       (or the successful). That WCW is checking the reader's
       urge to categorize people on a moral scale in the
       first place. But, then, isn't he actually judging those
       who judge too much? Can judgment really be done
        away with that easily? I am skeptical (as you might
        have guessed) and maybe the only way "out" of the
        quandary (the "quary", the "wilderness of tropes" is
        to judge judging, to damn damning, to hate hatred,
        to have one's rice cake and eat it too, and accelerate
        the process of meaning so it approximates meaningless
        ness (a disclaimer on a meaning level--mere aesthetic
        formal structural concerns) while at the same time
        getting to be apocalyptic (kinda like Will Alexander's
        ASIA AND HAITI, but other examples too).....chris s.

Are we speaking "all time" or 20th Century? I'm overwhelmed by the choices.
Genet for you, but for me, even in France, Mallarme just for that throw of
the dice & the book as spiritual instrument, or maybe Apollinaire, and even
Proust I have to go back to every few years. I think I'll just go back to
being overwhelmed. I don't think anybody wins hands down -- but up, perhaps?
