" It's smoky and gross out
here! " Metabolism complained.
I got a new orange lighter
yesterday.  The blaze was contained
in a setting as tranquil as Patriot
missles would allow. Tighter
parrots would kick over salt-
rimmed glasses, stinging her eyes.
He reasoned that it wasn't HIS fault
those kids near Virginia Beach died
of such a supple flu, as Great White
played on,  and on. All Metabolism
wanted to know was: how quickly
can we get through this? A child,
HIV-positive, gets sneakily  missing
and without her head to guide us
sits up in a Carolina woods.  Kissing
makes any space it folds in mild.
"For god's sake, peasant, open
the window!" she bawled. But it was
just another advertisement, for
something called space.

I woke up this morning thinking about "material breach" the expression used
both in the description of what the Columbia space shuttle and the one, "if
proven", will be used to proceed to the "shock and awe" missle / bomb attack
on Baghdad.  In case anybody missed the specifics of the Pentagon's
intention for the US  to shatter Iraq "physically, emotionally and
psychologically" by raining down on its people as many as 800 cruise
missiles in two days.The Pentagon battle plan aims not only to crush Iraqi
troops, but also wipe out power and water supplies in the capital, Baghdad.
It is based on a strategy known as "Shock and Awe", conceived at the
National Defense University in Washington, in which between 300 and 400
cruise missiles would fall on Iraq each day for two consecutive days. It
would be more than twice the number of missiles launched during the entire
40 days of the 1991 Gulf War." (This is part of  the information from which
Bob Perleman built his poem for the Philadelphia Enquirer.)
But I today what are the ways to "syntactically breach" Bush's sanitized
publish version of a quick, clean  war in which Iraq will be bombed into a
peaceful, soon flourishing democracy. (Isn't this the geopolitical version
Ronald and Nancy Reagan - in those fifty's General Electric TV ads - where
the couple flips the switch and beatifically smile "with us" at the freshly
illumined, newly furnished family kitchen").
I am thinking there must be a way for White House reporters - now that might
be a stretch - to crack and breach Ari F's bullet proof syntax as he
represents the President's case. With the information out onShock & Awe, why
can't the reporters just drill down and ask for specific details?  In Ed
Sander's terms practice  "An Investigative Poetics". Such as
1. What are the projected statistical numbers of citizens - including
fathers, mothers, children and others that will be killed in such an attack.
2. What will be the range of psychological problems experienced by those who
are not killed during "Shock & Awe".  How will the fledgling democracy
attend to these 'problems'
3. How much will it cost the USA to  rebuild  Baghdad's water and power
supply, provide food and for how long to the City.

My sense is that the more numerical and graphic the information, the more
likely more and more people will be repulsed by what seems obviously an act
of slaughter - under "democratic" cover.

I am thinking a next and immediate move - since most of these reporters are
as cowed as many in Congress unless shaken by public demand  - is to
re-identify the Washington reporters from our local papers (including  NPR)
- whether they cover the White House or Pentagon or Congress. And to pepper
them with these questions, insisting that they ask Ari & Company for the
full projected Shock & Awe consequences and facts.

In fact I am going to suggest this as one more strategy to the folks who led
yesterdays Virtual March. Maybe there is a little breathing room left. In
any case I am going to push with the editors at the SF Chronicle  - they've
got two guys back there.

More thoughts welcome.

MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII

sciolist (SAI-uh-list) noun

   One who engages in pretentious display of superficial knowledge.

[From Late Latin sciolus (smatterer), diminutive of Latin scius (knowing),
from scire (to know). Another example of the similar kind of word formation
is the name of the bird oriole which is derived from the diminutive form of
Latin aureus (golden).]

  "Never was so brilliant a lecture-room as his evening banqueting-hall;
   highly connected students from Rome mixed with the sharp-witted provincial
   of Greece or Asia Minor; and the flippant sciolist, and the nondescript
   visitor, half philosopher, half tramp, met with a reception, courteous
   always, but suitable to his deserts."
   John Henry Newman; The Idea Of A University, University Life At Athens;
   1854.

  "On the other hand, judged strictly by the standard of his own time,
   (Francis) Bacon's ignorance of the progress which science had up to that
   time made is only to be equalled by his insolence toward men in comparison
   with whom he was the merest sciolist."
   Thomas H. Huxley; Harvey Discovers The Circulation Of The Blood;
   History of the World.

This week's theme: words to describe people.

Success usually comes to those who are too busy to be looking for it.
-Henry David Thoreau, naturalist and author (1817-1862)

"A banquet of words!" -Richard Lederer, author of The Miracle of Language
"A refreshing approach to words." -John Simpson, Chief Editor, the OED

enough, which the editors began to assemble following 9/11 at the start =
of the U.S. war on Afghanistan, is a collection of poets whose writings =
are interactive with the current time, writing as its matter and syntax =
not separate from oppressive conditions and war. In enough, U.S. poets, =
British, Palestinian, Iraqi, Israeli, speak back and forth to each other =
only in the medium of their art. The editorial basis of enough is that =
these poets' art is not separate from their being in the world - and =
that: Seeing what's happening is a form of change.

CSIS paints anti-trade movement as menace
Top-secret report warns of 'violent and extreme' elements

Stewart Bell, with files from Mary Vallis
National Post

Monday, February 24, 2003


A top-secret intelligence document says the violent
fringes of the anti-globalization movement remain a
security concern for Canada and that "extraordinary
caution" is necessary to prevent trouble at international
gatherings.

Although security agencies have since Sept. 11 focused
their efforts extensively on the dangers of Islamic
terrorism, the Canadian Security Intelligence Service
report says Canada is also threatened by homegrown
domestic extremists, notably anti-globalization radicals.

The briefing report, dated last November, shows months
after Canada hosted the G8 Summit without incident in
Kananaskis, Alta., Canada's intelligence service continues
to view anti-globalization violence as a problem.

"The presence of world leaders in Kananaskis reminded us
that one of the newest emerging domestic threats emanates
from the highly-publicized phenomenon of
anti-globalization," said the CSIS briefing.

"Security was taken seriously [and] certainly contributed
to making this event happen almost violence free .... The
rationale for this extraordinary caution will continue for
future meetings.

"We must not forget, as graphically illustrated by the
actions in Quebec City, and in Genoa, Italy in 2001, that
there are elements within the movement which are violent
and extreme," the CSIS briefing said.

An anti-globalization protester was killed for the first
time in anti-capitalist riots during the extremely violent
clash outside a G8 meeting in Genoa.

A police officer shot Carlo Giuliani, 23, after he lobbed
a fire extinguisher through the shattered window of a
police vehicle that had been cornered by a frenzied crowd
of demonstrators. The threat posed by such
anti-globalization groups has also been apparent in
Canada. In Quebec City in April, 2001, rioting militants
attacked police guarding the Summit of the Americas
conference. Nineteen officers were injured and some 400
protesters were arrested. Some protesters had sawed-off
hockey sticks and attacked the police with smoke bombs and
chunks of concrete.

Two months later, CSIS advised Parliament that violent
fringe groups such as the Black Bloc anarchists, as well
as militant factions of animal rights and environmental
groups, were showing up at anti-globalization protests
alongside trade unions, left-wing politicians and
non-violent protesters.

Clifford Orwin, a political scientist at the University of
Toronto, said anti-globalization demonstrations will
probably always attract "violent elements."

"It would be quite surprising if they didn't," he said,
adding violent protesters are drawn by the allure of
publicity.

The briefing report on counter-terrorism was prepared for
Wayne Easter, federal Solicitor-General, shortly after he
took over the Cabinet post from Lawrence MacAulay. It was
released to the National Post under the Access to
Information Act.

It identifies the al-Qaeda terrorist network as the
agency's top concern. After Sept. 11, Canada intensified
its investigations into Islamic extremists, it said.

"As we have witnessed, one of the prime motivations for
terrorism today is religious extremism. Islamic terrorists
use a militant interpretation of the Koran to justify
using extreme violence to enforce their beliefs."

The main threat comes from Sunni Muslim extremists. About
85% of Muslims are Sunnis, it says. A small minority see
Osama bin Laden as a figurehead and adhere to his belief
in a jihad, or holy war, against non-Muslims and moderate
Muslims.

"Although the recent audio recording, now assessed to be
the voice of bin Laden, specifically makes reference to
Canada as a potential target of future terrorist attacks,
it has [long] been our assessment that al-Qaeda posed a
threat to Canada's interests."

But Islamic terrorists are not the only threat to Canada.
Elements within Canadian multicultural groups are also
actively supporting secessionist movements in such
countries as India, Sri Lanka, Turkey, Ireland and the
Middle East, the report says.

"Most of the world's major Sikh terrorist groups are
represented in Canada," it says, adding that three B.C.
Sikhs have been charged with the 1985 Air-India bombing
that killed 329.

Hooked on Classics: Oprah Resurrects Book Club with Old School Authors

Oprah Winfrey braved a Washington, D.C., snowstorm yesterday to deliver
good news to a publishing industry in need of some cheering up. While
Winfrey did not announce plans to resume her TV book club in its old
format, she did say that she plans to start a new club devoted to the
classics. "I'm back in the business of recommending books...but with a
difference," Winfrey said.

With the tentative title of Traveling with the Classics, the club will
select titles three to five times per year. The show will travel to the
place where each book is set, and Winfrey might pick several books from
the same author at one time. To provide support for readers, a companion
study guide will be available at Oprah.com.

No start date was given for the new club, but an announcement is
expected to be made in an upcoming episode of the Oprah Winfrey Show
this season, which wraps up in June. "I cannot imagine a world where the
great works of literature are not read," Winfrey said.

*Reaction from the industry was swift. Publishers began counting the
classics on their backlist, while others hoped Winfrey meant modern
classics and not just those in the public domain. Booksellers and
distributors hoped that Winfrey's project would stimulate new interest
in books and reading.*

!!!

The program sounds similar to C-SPAN's American Writers series, which
broadcast live footage of scholars, historians and readers discussing a
writer's opus on location in a place associated with the writer's work.
The series, which aired throughout 2002, started with William Bradford
(author of the Mayflower Compact) and ended 45 episodes later with Neil
Sheehan (author of A Bright Shining Lie).

In her speech leading up to the announcement, which brought a cheer from
publishing's leaders gathered for the Association of American
Publishers' annual meeting (she was there to receive the AAP Honors
Awards), Winfrey again stressed the importance of books and reading in
her life. She said that since suspending her club last spring she has
missed the interaction with authors and books and has grown concerned
that books have come under fire from other, competing media
offerings.--Nora Rawlinson and Jim Milliot

The day the sun fell down boom on the sidewalk
writhing. It looked just like a baby, a bright baby
who knew how to talk and how to sit up and how to tie
her shoes. No-one picks up the sun, or holds it,
because it's just too hot. That heat will eat us, we
say. That heat will burn us  away.
        The day the sun fell down boom on the sidewalk,
writing started to look like a thicket from which we'd
never emerge. Sure, I woke up as usual, examined the
illicit downloads, made coffee, but only because I
know how much you like detail. In the mouths of all
the neighborhood ravens USB cables slick like early
morning erections pressured the government into
colonizing a people far away. The coffee was good
though, as I'd practiced it sadly to tailor our
tastes.
        That day we filled our car with blood. It ran well.
We drove it. The sun fell down and it was a child who
had no shoes. She was crippled.
        At the mall my people shuffled through aisles of
bright goods. All the light had flattened and gone
cold, and I thought maybe all these fabulous goods
weren't so fabulous; I thought maybe they were flat
and cold. It was warmer that day than it's ever been.
All my people were sweating, and the sweat ate some of
them away.

U.S. Diplomat John Brady Kiesling: Letter of Resignation



CIRCULATE WILDLY

------------------------------------------------------------------------

<a href="http://www.commondreams.org/views03/0227-13.htm">U.S.
Diplomat's Letter of Resignation</a>

by John Brady Kiesling

<i>The following is the text of John Brady Kiesling's letter of
resignation to Secretary of State Colin L. Powell. Mr. Kiesling is a
career diplomat who has served in United States embassies from Tel Aviv
to Casablanca to Yerevan.</i>

Dear Mr. Secretary:

I am writing you to submit my resignation from the Foreign Service of
the United States and from my position as Political Counselor in U.S.
Embassy Athens, effective March 7. I do so with a heavy heart. The
baggage of my upbringing included a felt obligation to give something
back to my country. Service as a U.S. diplomat was a dream job. I was
paid to understand foreign languages and cultures, to seek out
diplomats, politicians, scholars and journalists, and to persuade them
that U.S. interests and theirs fundamentally coincided. My faith in my
country and its values was the most powerful weapon in my diplomatic
arsenal.

It is inevitable that during twenty years with the State Department I
would become more sophisticated and cynical about the narrow and
selfish bureaucratic motives that sometimes shaped our policies. Human
nature is what it is, and I was rewarded and promoted for understanding
human nature. But until this Administration it had been possible to
believe that by upholding the policies of my president I was also
upholding the interests of the American people and the world. I believe
it no longer.

The policies we are now asked to advance are incompatible not only with
American values but also with American interests. Our fervent pursuit
of war with Iraq is driving us to squander the international legitimacy
that has been America’s most potent weapon of both offense and defense
since the days of Woodrow Wilson. We have begun to dismantle the
largest and most effective web of international relationships the world
has ever known. Our current course will bring instability and danger,
not security.

The sacrifice of global interests to domestic politics and to
bureaucratic self-interest is nothing new, and it is certainly not a
uniquely American problem. Still, we have not seen such systematic
distortion of intelligence, such systematic manipulation of American
opinion, since the war in Vietnam. The September 11 tragedy left us
stronger than before, rallying around us a vast international coalition
to cooperate for the first time in a systematic way against the threat
of terrorism. But rather than take credit for those successes and build
on them, this Administration has chosen to make terrorism a domestic
political tool, enlisting a scattered and largely defeated Al Qaeda as
its bureaucratic ally. We spread disproportionate terror and confusion
in the public mind, arbitrarily linking the unrelated problems of
terrorism and Iraq. The result, and perhaps the motive, is to justify a
vast misallocation of shrinking public wealth to the military and to
weaken the safeguards that protect American citizens from the heavy
hand of government. September 11 did not do as much damage to the
fabric of American society as we seem determined to so to ourselves. Is
the Russia of the late Romanovs really our model, a selfish,
superstitious empire thrashing toward self-destruction in the name of a
doomed status quo?

We should ask ourselves why we have failed to persuade more of the
world that a war with Iraq is necessary. We have over the past two
years done too much to assert to our world partners that narrow and
mercenary U.S. interests override the cherished values of our partners.
Even where our aims were not in question, our consistency is at issue.
The model of Afghanistan is little comfort to allies wondering on what
basis we plan to rebuild the Middle East, and in whose image and
interests. Have we indeed become blind, as Russia is blind in Chechnya,
as Israel is blind in the Occupied Territories, to our own advice, that
overwhelming military power is not the answer to terrorism? After the
shambles of post-war Iraq joins the shambles in Grozny and Ramallah, it
will be a brave foreigner who forms ranks with Micronesia to follow
where we lead.

We have a coalition still, a good one. The loyalty of many of our
friends is impressive, a tribute to American moral capital built up
over a century. But our closest allies are persuaded less that war is
justified than that it would be perilous to allow the U.S. to drift
into complete solipsism. Loyalty should be reciprocal. Why does our
President condone the swaggering and contemptuous approach to our
friends and allies this Administration is fostering, including among
its most senior officials. Has “oderint dum metuant” really become our
motto?

I urge you to listen to America’s friends around the world. Even here
in Greece, purported hotbed of European anti-Americanism, we have more
and closer friends than the American newspaper reader can possibly
imagine. Even when they complain about American arrogance, Greeks know
that the world is a difficult and dangerous place, and they want a
strong international system, with the U.S. and EU in close partnership.
When our friends are afraid of us rather than for us, it is time to
worry. And now they are afraid. Who will tell them convincingly that
the United States is as it was, a beacon of liberty, security, and
justice for the planet?

Mr. Secretary, I have enormous respect for your character and ability.
You have preserved more international credibility for us than our
policy deserves, and salvaged something positive from the excesses of
an ideological and self-serving Administration. But your loyalty to the
President goes too far. We are straining beyond its limits an
international system we built with such toil and treasure, a web of
laws, treaties, organizations, and shared values that sets limits on
our foes far more effectively than it ever constrained America’s
ability to defend its interests.

I am resigning because I have tried and failed to reconcile my
conscience with my ability to represent the current U.S.
Administration. I have confidence that our democratic process is
ultimately self-correcting, and hope that in a small way I can
contribute from outside to shaping policies that better serve the
security and prosperity of the American people and the world we share.

TED’S HEAD



So there’s this episode of Mary Tyler Moore where Ted’s trying to get a
raise & after finagling and shenaniganizing he puts one over on Lou &
gets his contract changed to non-exclusive sos he can do commercials
which is not cool WI Lou & the gang because Ted’s just a brainless gimp
& it hurts the image of the news to have the anchorman selling tomato
slicers & dogfood so Lou gets despondent because the contract can’t be
rescinded but then he gets mad & calls Ted into his office & says, you
know his voice, “You’re going to stop doing commercials, Ted” & Ted
says “why would I do that Lou?” & Lou says ‘Because if you don’t I’ll
punch your face out” & Ted says “I’ll have you arrested” & Lou says
“It’ll be too late, your face will be broken, you’re not gonna get too
many commercials with a broken face now are you Ted?” & Ted buckles
under to force & everybody loves it that Lou’s not despondent anymore
he’s back to his brustling chubby loud loveable whiskey-drinking
football-loving ways.  Now imagine if Ted were Lou, if Ted were the
boss. You know how incredibly fucking brainless Ted is, but let’s
imagine he understands & is willing to use force. That’s the situation
we’re now in as Americans.

DEEPLY IMMORAL ARROGANT AND IGNORANT


                For this you get a degree in the government
                        of My World My Rules
                    Here’s some of the buzz words —
                        Foolhardy and Inexplicable

                The current president has been called
                        ‘a craven coward’
                    by the female senator from California
                      and it’s only May 2001!

                           And now    still
                almost a Constant Sense of Outrage
           Corporate capitalist oligarchies own the war
          Feel Terrified? The ‘war’

             Can go where it wants, when it wants
                  with bizarre expansions
                          Endless war fear hysteria. Great

There is NEVER an end to profit.    There is NEVER enough
There are no ‘acceptable losses’ when it means more ‘money’

There is no end to profit    There is NEVER enough
That said again, do we enumerate the stunningly horrible


        ‘My Way or No Way’ direction of the Bushies
             in the world
                      and start gnashing teeth and going ga-ga

But there’s the voice of the people’ isn’t there?
        I hear articulate political observation
                that hasn’t collapsed into goofy anxious patriotism
        that informs and lifts      the veil of secrecy

                        ‘The state of the union is none of your
business’
                             says the Vice

                                  Evil Terrorism   or   Live Rebellion?

                always just out of reach except for the kid from Mann

                Terrorist weather yesterday heavy frost and snow
                    collateral damage to the lemons
                           and baby Bok Choy

                                But what about all the hot air
produced?
                                   At least I enumerate with outrage
                                      At least I must articulate
                                            At least I know what’s
wrong

when someone in virginia

over afghanistan programmed
to seek males over six feet two
where they shouldn’t be

presses a button

LITTLE WRONGS


When the cold-blooded are proved right —
judgment secure — case complete
we will first see a tangle
of close-ups — gourd and gold

and apples still rotten
rugosa roses down to three petals only
and each holocaust will be an ant-heap


All the little wrongs will come into focus

But who will be glad about this?

---

Even the bigamists
who thought they were splitting
each lie into fragments
too small to be located

might find their trail is following them

And the short-sighted whose faces
are a blur of glee
may begin to establish shapes
around pockets of light and air
in the thicket they are part of

but they won’t sense the force
that gathers those shapes

into actual consequence
until they themselves can’t go forward

And neither will the hesitant
experience their weakness
as an ability
until it gathers into a body
of uncertainties that has influence

When the one big cruelty comes down on us
out of a seeming emptiness

it will be a helium packed with the force
of freely given evasions

so if some still believe
that the cold-blooded alone are responsible
for this power
how will they show that it came from elsewhere

Nothing has increased

Adah Isaacs Mencken (1835-1868), actress and poet whose father was probably
a "free Negro" in antebellum New Orleans, was friends with Walt Whitman.
She was among the first poets (if not _the_ first poet) to be influenced by
his work. Her one volume is _Infelicia_. Some of her poems are bold,
brassy, and feminist ("I Am Judith!" for example), and worth a look.

Here's a website (deals more with her life as a celebrity than as a poet,
though). A fascinating person.

"FEMALE HORSE FASTENED WITH WAX" /
"BITE THE WAX TADPOLE"

from

http://www.urbanlegends.com/products/coca-cola/coca-cola_chinese.html



It was obvious that the Coca-Cola trademark had to be
transliterated into Chinese characters in order to
reach the millions in the market. Chinese, both
written and spoken, is so completely alien to any
European language that the simplest foreign word or
term
is a tongue twister to the Chinese.

To find the nearest phonetic equivalent to Coca-Cola
required a separate Chinese character for each of the
four syllables. Out of the 40,000 or so characters
there are only about 200 that are pronounced with the
sounds we needed and many of these had to be
avoided because of their meaning.

While doing the research for four suitable characters
we found that a number of shopkeepers had also been
looking for Chinese equivalents for "Coca-Cola" but
with weird results. Some had made crude signs that
were absurd in the extreme, adopting any old group of
characters that sounded remotely like "Coca-Cola"
without giving a thought as to the meaning of the
characters used.

One of these homemade signs sounded like "Coca-Cola"
when pronounced but the meaning of the characters came
out something like "female horse fastened with wax"
and another "bite the wax tadpole". The character for
wax, pronounced La, appeared in both signs because
that was the sound these untutored sign makers were
looking for. Any Chinese reading the signs would
recognize them as a crude attempt to make up an
arbitrary phonetic combination.

Although we were primarily concerned with the phonetic
equivalent of "Coca-Cola", we could not ignore the
meaning of the characters, individually and
collectively, as the free-wheeling sign makers had
done. The closet Mandarin equivalent to "Coca-Cola" we
could find was K'o K'ou K'o Le^. The aspirates
(designated by ') are necessary to approximate the
English sounds. There is no suitable character
pronounced La in Chinese so we compromised on Le^
(joy) which is approximately pronounced ler. We chose
the Mandarin because this dialect is spoken by the
great majority of Chinese.

Incidentally, Chinese has to be interpreted into
English rather than translated, and vice versa. All
Chinese characters have more than one meaning but the
[four chosen] (depending on context) commonly mean:

K'o = To permit, be able, may, can

K'ou = Mouth, hole, pass, harbor

K'o = as above

Le^ = Joy, to rejoice, to laugh, to be happy

It would seem that the Chinese trademark means to
permit mouth to be able to rejoice -- or something
palatable from which one derives pleasure. Not once in
ten million times could a company literally pronounce
their trademark in English and have the sounds
mean something desirable in the Chinese language.

The mainland of China is out of the market
indefinitely but fortunately most of the 2,000,000
Chinese in Hong Kong and the 9,000,000 in Taiwan
understand Mandarin. Even the 10,000,000 overseas
Chinese, who mostly speak Cantonese or Fukienese,
realize that K'o K'ou K'o Le^ is the Mandarin Chinese
trademark for "Coca-Cola".

(International Press, March 2, 2003) At six-thirty this morning - as the sun
was about to rise -  Park Rangers discovered the  Viet-Nam Memorial to be
covered end to end with a layering of white tarps. "NO WAR IN IRAQ" was
spelled out in large, lavender colored, block letters.
"In the early light, the shape of the Memorial looked like the covered wing
span - tip to tip -  of a  B-52 bomber," one of the Rangers reported. Asked
how it was done, he said, "In front, the layered tarps were sealed together
with re-enforced duct tape. On the backside, the riveted edges of the tarps
were pulled back over the grass with white ropes and carefully tied and
staked into the ground."
"It made it impossible to see the names of any of the dead," the Ranger
added.
At the White House, Ari Fleisher would only comment, "This is one more
example of the lies and deception practiced by those who are against this
war."
Rangers were ordered to quickly remove the tarps before the media could be
notified and either photograph or film the wrapped Memorial.
"The refusal to notify the Press was done for Security reasons," the White
House reported and would make no further comment..
This is the first time the Memorial has ever been used as a protest site
against a projected war.
No one has yet to claim responsibility for the Memorial wrapping.
The Christos - famous for wrapping public sites - were reported to be out
doing research for their new project in Central Park and not available for
comment.

Dear JFK, I don't believe we've corresponded before. I'll introduce
myself,but first let me say that I've never read in Australia--never have
been to Austraia--though I have a long history of poetic involvement there,
dating back to  a friendship with Kris Hemmensley in the 70s. A Google
search will provide you with useful information. I've published more than 30
books, mostly of poetry but also a short story    collection,a novel, and a
novella. I would like to participate in your festival, very much. For 30
years I taught poetry and poetry-writing at UC Berkeley, Sonoma State Univ.,
and the Univ. of San Francisco, as well as for shorter spells at other
venues,among these the Royaumont Foundation in Paris and the Jack Kerouac
School at Naropa.

 Is there any way that I can get at least a portion of my expenses paid for
what must be a costly trip--I live in California, just outside of San
Francisco? I have just published a new book of poems, AS IN T AS IN TETHER,
a copy whiich I'd be pleased to send you.   Sincerely, David Bromige.

history is a process of matching our deeds to our creed: e

Happy Birthday to Us



(Setting: The Yellow House Briefing Room.  The room is a mix of a stately
Federalist-style reception hall and television talk show studio.  The
President of the Free World, the dominant country on Earth, is about to make
a special announcement to his constituents across the globe.  A group of
about 30 journalists are assembled there to witness the President's speech,
along with some television cameras.)

Announcer:  Ladies and gentleman, The President of the Free World.  Please
rise.

(Enter, stage right, the President of the Free World.  He looks past the
small crowd of journalists present in the briefing room and waves as if
greeting a much larger crowd behind them, a crowd that we can see is that
simply isn't there.  He then sits down at a desk that faces the crowd.  He
gently indicates to the crowd, both real and imaginary, to sit down as well
through small reassuring hand gestures.  A large television camera is rolled
into position directly in front of the President, blocking the view of most
of the people assembled in the room.  He picks up some blank sheets of paper
before him and then begins reading from a teleprompter located behind the
camera.  The President begins to speak, slowly, carefully while wearing a
slight grin--"a twinkle in his eye.")

Mr. President:  Good evening, people of the Free World.  I come to you today
to sit down and speak with you about the importance of a resource so
precious, so sacred, we all must do our part to ensure people everywhere are
able to enjoy that resource.

As the leader of the free world, I have decided that from this day forward,
every day is your birthday.  That's right--every day is your birthday.
Every day is my birthday.  Every day is our birthday, and every day will
remain our birthday so as long as we remain free.

I promise to make each new day a birthday for all freedom-loving people of
the The Free World.  Every day will be an opportunity for rebirth, for
spiritual renewal, for love and joy and singing happy birthday and bringing
that wonderful melody to all the people of the world who are not so
fortunate as to be allowed to make every day their birthday.

(reassuringly) So today is your birthday.  Every day is your birthday.
Today is my birthday.  Every day is my birthday.  Happy Birthday to
everyone.  Happy birthday to the Free World.

I want to wish happy birthday today to Elmira Campbell of Lexington,
Kentucky.  Happy birthday to Carlito Guenaras of Conception, Paraguay.
Happy birthday to Albrecht Pfeifer of Obertraun, Austria.  Happy birthday to
Hatta Sudiro of Salatiga, Indonesia.  Happy birthday to Joabim Mercado of
Sao Paolo, Brazil.  Happy birthday to Ntele Shimango of Benin, Nigeria.  To
Isaac Schomberg of Jenin, Israel.  To Patrick MacPherson of Glasgow,
Scotland.  Yes, happy birthday to all of us.  I wish each and every one of
us all a happy birthday.

(indignence) For some, however, each day means bearing the heavy burden of
not having the freedom to make every day their birthday. For Zeng Xiaodao of
Shanghai, it is not his birthday today.  He is 64 years and 231 days today.
Neither is it the birthday of Tariq el-Aziz of Basra, Iraq.  He is 32 years,
21 days old today.  And then there's little Juanita Santiago of Buenovanita,
Colombia, who will go to bed never never having the freedom today to hear
the sweet tones of the "Happy Birthday" song.  Juanita is 9 years, 137 days
old today.

It will be our mission, then, as a free people, as citizens of the Free
World, to bring freedom and birthdays to every man woman and child on this
God-given great Earth.  After all, who could possibly say no to birthdays?
What sort of evil hate-filled soul could dare spoil the wonder of
celebrating a birthday?  Let us not kid ourselves.  Such people are among
us, lurking in the shadows of the Free World, doing everything in their
power to prevent all human being from celebrating their birthdays every day.

We as a free people at this moment resolve to make sure that everyone has
the right to be free to celebrate his birthday every day.  We must rise from
the ashes of yesterday's tragedies and stand poised on the brink of a
glorious new day for the whole world.  We must be ready to face the
challenge of bringing birthdays to all nations and all peoples, of every
creed, color, and tongue--even those who have never experienced the joys of
tearing open brightly colored gift paper, of extinguishing the fires of
gently burning birthday candles, of slicing open a birthday cake still warm
from the oven, of taking that first moist bite, of hearing even the first
notes of the greatest song of freedom: Happy Birthday.  We must ask
ourselves, then, not whether the Free World can sing happy birthday to us,
but whether we can sing the Free World happy birthday.

(The president then stands, loosens his tie and begins to sing and dance,
Broadway style...)

So happy birthday to me.
Happy birthday to you.
Happy birthday to me and you.
Happy birthday to us.

We are glad to be free.
It's a birthday for me.
It's the birthday of humanity.
It's our birthday, can't you see?

Why do so many people fuss?
Why do so many spit and cuss?
Why not hop on the birthday bus?
Happy birthday to us.

When the morning brings the sun,
Its warm ra-di-a-tion,
Birthdays free or by a gentle gun.
Your birthday freedom is hard-won.

So it's a great day to be free.
Let's hang evil from a tree.
Birthdays set the whole world free.
So happy birthday from me.

So happy birthday to me.
Happy birthday to you.
Happy birthday to me and you.
Happy birthday to us.


(Sits down again, straightens his tie, and returns to his speech-making
voice):

Thank you, God bless, and happy birthday.


END

I wish I had thought to pass this on sooner. Ann Simon died in her home in
Berkeley this past Monday, February 24, surrounded by family and friends to
the last. Her last word, I am told, was "yum." Ann was overcome suddenly by
a cancer which she had been fighting for the past year. She was very
private and very dear, and will be dear always to everyone who knows her or
her work.

There is a memorial celebration of Ann's life planned for today (Saturday
March 1) at the Black Box Theater in Oakland. This is at 1928 Telegraph
Avenue, across from the old Fox Theater. From noon to 3 there will be
remembrances and performances in Ann's memory, giving way to a more
informal gathering which will go until 6 or so. Bay Area list-members
reading this late, I'm sorry. I'm not even sure that's the year she was
born. But anyone reading this today who can make it to downtown Oakland
will be welcomed and, I think, comforted even.

My heart to everyone this message touches.

Creeley discusses an anti-war group, penises and poetry



Robert Creeley spoke with students Thursday night and Friday afternoon
about topics ranging from World War II to poetry to old age.



-- Lance Orr, senior staff reporter



Renowned poet Robert Creeley visited the UA campus Thursday and Friday
to lecture and do a poetry reading. Photo by Lindsey Herring.
Robert Creeley, one of America's most widely known and influential
poets, held a reading Feb. 20 at the University of Alabama's Mary Alston
Hall.

Throughout the reading, Creeley spent much time talking about his
involvement with the "Poets Against the War" group and his experiences
while serving as an ambulance driver in Burma during World War II.
"Poets Against the War" is a group founded by Sam Hamilton that is
attempting to martial off what they see as a forthcoming war with Iraq.

"'The Poets against the War' [came together] to make a modest, but
heartfelt commitment, to why to why this country is going to war against
Iraq," Creeley said.

Creeley said that, judging from his own experiences in WWII, war is,
disbarring the tragedies, "like some awful black comedy."

Creeley called war "impractical," because "you only get one life."

"World War II [was] a righteous war...but seemed ridiculous," Creeley
said.

After such a serious topic, Creeley lightened the crowd's mood by
reading a poem about how one's body changes as it ages. He then relayed
a story about why he wrote it.

Creeley said that after age 50 or so, "you find you are no longer the
person you knew yourself to be."

Creeley earned a laugh from the crowd when he said that once you reach a
certain age it is hard "to expel fluid entirely from the penis," and
that is why "old men often have pee stains on their underwear."

Creeley's poem-which he interrupted at numerous points to regal the
crowd with a story about how his doctor told him how to strip the last
remnants of urine from the penis (it involved the phrase, "so now you
stand at a public toilet seemingly playing with yourself")-began as a
joke, but ended as a cry for people not to put their again loved ones
into care facilities.

Creeley ended the reading at 8:50 p.m. with "What time is it? Time to go
to bed?" He met with students the next day at noon in room 301 of UA's
Morgan Hall.

In the afternoon session, Creeley answered questions from the gathered
crowd about his life, writing and what he thought of the world today.

Creeley said that he had never intended to be a poet, but had begun his
writing career wanting to write story stories and novels.

"It was not that I didn't trust poetry...but it was too simple. I wrote
it easily," Creeley said.

The "wrote it easily" comment was a reference to how Creeley said he
never revises his works.

"I can't re-see it. The material has gone stiff," Creeley said, as a
reason for why he does not revise.

Creeley also said it was his fear of the empty page that made him not
take up prose writing as enthusiastically as he did poetry.

"[I'm] threatened like a guinea pig of open spaces," Creeley said.

Creeley spoke at length about his own education and his 30 years of
teaching at the State University of New York in Buffalo. Creeley was
raised in New England and said much of his linguistic skill was owed to
his enthusiastic reading and young study of Latin.

"I liked Latin. One could muse on it. Think about it," Creeley said.

Creeley also said he thought it was his differences - he lost an eye at
age 4 - and his peculiar look at the term "imagination" that also led to
his success as a poet.

Creeley quoted fellow poet William Carlos Williams by saying,
"Imagination is the only thing that is real."

An audience member asked Creeley to explain how imagination affects
writing and what the true nature of it is.

"Do you have imagination?" Creeley asked.

"Yes, I just don't know what it is sometimes," the audience member
answered.

"Anybody got a dictionary?" Creeley said and laughed.

"That's how it is sometimes," Creeley said. "When I looked up poet in
the dictionary, it said somebody who writes poems. When I looked up
poems it said something written by a poet. Some things are hard to
quantify and understand."

"Relax" -- interesting choice of words! When I read your
posts, man, I can almost see the veins popping out on your
forehead. But I got nothing against righteous anger slash
inspired lunacy, I really don't. I like Artaud as much as
the next guy. I just don't think that when Nietzsche talked
about philosophizing with a hammer he had Tonya Harding in
mind.

That said, my own listserv experience started with a couple
of heavy academic lists. Talk about the school of
quietude -- I'll take the rowdy bastards around here any
day.

Yours,
Damian

legs blown off..


legs blown off is to hobble for poker tonight
we give him cyborg legs with a free prostitute
at McDonalds
He drinks until his belly sags television propagandanvil
his arm drawn up like a claw and twitching
his beard clumpy indistinct, you say "mad"
and there is a mosaic of his pills, he does not take them
a mosaic of funny little pills, who approved them
who made them, what do they really do, he asks
the spittle flying from his mouth
forming tiny globular scenes, flag being raised at iwo jima
a peace-sign waving nixon, a cigar entering a young vagina

legs blown off is to hobble for cinema tonight
his 37 mothers drape their bloody batwings around him
his father installs a giant eardrum in the bathroom
at McDonalds
He smokes until lungs grow eyes, bleeding languages from his blinking
nipples
his arm drawn up like a poker, digging in the ashes
with his best friend's femur bone
looking for a can of vienna sausage
and there on the battlefield a mosaic of bones, he does not take them
for they are a perfect picture, and natural
"this happens about every 5 or 10 years now.."

Dear Friend of POG:

I'm hoping you'll be willing to fill out a short email questionnaire about
POG's recent programming.

Audience feedback is an important part of POG's program planning; it's also
important that our grant applications document this dimension of our
programming.

so: if you're willing to fill out a short questionnaire, please email me at
mailto:pog@gopog.org and I'll send you the email questionnaire form to
complete and email back to me.

We'd like to tally the questionnaires within the next two weeks, so the
sooner the better!

thanks for your time, and for your interest in POG.

Tenney Nathanson

While I appreciate the importance of understanding what Shelley meant, my
feeling is that, so like many popular quotations, this one appears so often
shorn of context that it's taken on another life. The meaning intended by a
writer is not always the meaning readers/ listeners construe.

If we do read legislators as visionary revolutionaries, I still have trouble
accepting this statement. True of a minority but can't the rest of us be
content with the humbler designation of the scientist who makes and tests
hypotheses? And even that doesn't seem adequate to the range of endeavours
comprised by poetry.

Stephen:
Thank you. I originally wrote "BUT from the seamstresses' point of
view...," but figured you wd pick up the implication w/o it and you
did.

Chung passed away in 1990 at the age of 40. Her mother and paternal
grandmother worked a total of 70 years in New York sewing factories
and participated in the demonstrations of 1982 that won them health
insurance, but not measures to insure that employers wd honor
minimum-wage laws. The protests helped change the ILGWU's perception
of Chinese women factory workers as passive and afraid of opposing
Chinatown's power structures.

Frances' very concise poetry and prose vignettes dealt w many topics
and the forms she used ranged from ravishing haiku to lists of
manipulated quotations from a Classical Chinese-English dictionary. I
encourage you to read more of her work! There was an appreciative
review in the "Books in Brief" section of the NY Times Book Review,
at <www.nytimes.com/books/01/02/25/bib/010225.rv095948.html>.

Btw do you or anyone else on the list have suggestions for how to
read the D. H. Lawrence allusion in the part I quoted below ("They
sometimes wear cloth masks over their mouths, like doctors in an
operating room. (No one has heard of D. H. Lawrence.)")??

Remember, you with me instead Fagins! Younger poets have you with your hands
up, we've got far outweighed by what it takes away. The professionalization
of poetry is you is laughable, there is no smaller American payday. The
university presents debt-hole, what else is to be done then but poets with a
tangible corporate ladder, a way to measure ourselves against one another.
But when poets start their young lives in the art in a $40K.

Maurice Blanchot, He Kept to Himself

The scribbler, most secret of our era, has died, Thurs 20 Feb, in his cave in the Yveline Mountains, aged 95 years.  Author of essays and fictions, father of a most impertinent critique of the 20th century, his analyses permanently irritated Kafka and Holderlin, Bataille and des Forots.

Scribbling about soup ladles or Ambiguity, looking into the questions of mind, work, nihilism, hauling in words for interrogation, insisting on literature's "right to die," casting a sidways glance at politics and the world trade in disasters...  Blanchot did not invent or christen, authored no systems, no webs to catch the fly of fancy.  He looked and acted theoretical, treating literature as a stiff "in critical work of such complete assurance it permitted its own unimportance."

"The truth?  Nothing could be further from it than authors are.  It's being is self-obliteration, but without modesty, so hopped up on itself I don't even know how to say it; it is wrapped in the deafness of thought that drowns out everything else; it's there in the surprised look of the guy who gets an answer he wasn't expecting, and is stressed out by it: why can't you think for yourself?  Why go looking for help?  Your eyes may be clear, but it's the clarity of a baby's eyes, and babies don't know anything.  They look peaceful when they nap because they believe, wrongly, that they are safe."  A quote from the first page of The Ass of Man, published 1957, lines which, like a portrait, show us Blanchot's cruelty.

Flapping his wings above the monster's maw of existence, Blanchot strove with dementia, at the end of the year 1960, to create a life evermore perfect and empty.  With the exception of a rare photograph of him as a boy, in the epoque of Strasbourgian homework with his bud Emanuel Levinas, and a late snapshot of the maestro in the vicinity of Paris, our image of him is of a blanched slate.

The scribbler himself was a rigorous expunger of biography.  He would neither confirm nor dispute the official version of what he liked to eat for lunch.  His amigos, who formed a tight ring of "communidad" around him, respected his weird tics.  Roger Laporte, who threw him a famous birthday party in the year 1950 (it was not his birthday), spoke of his "preference for bonbons shaped like Mozart": "A little intimacy with Blanchot went a long way."  "Life is nothing but reading books and keeping one's mouth shut," inscribed Blanchot in a copy of his collected works.

Born in Squint (Allspice-Lorraine), 22 Sept 1907, to a catholic family.  Named for Saint Maurice.  Snoozed through philsophy, medicine, psychiatry, beside Roger Laporte, and never could think of a dissertation topic.  In Strasbourg: hit it off with Levinas and initiated his studies of the tongues of Husserl and Heidegger.

The year 1930: on the edge of French Action, a Young Republican, intense Debater, Combatant, Insurgent, Author of bloody Tracts.  A great one for giving the boot to foreigners.

He softened up in 1938.  With the occupation, joined the Resistance.  In 1941 published his first Oeuvres.  Won friends.  Influenced people.  At the end of the war, he wrote: "History ended at Auschwitz.  So why are you people still eating cheese and carrying on?"  Ending history became his obsession, no, more than that: the _horizon_ (mot perfecte!) of all his subsequent thought.

With the end of his youth, he became virulent.  He became a redacteur and revolutionary.  "We are more than a pest infestation, we are combat ants."  One of his last interventions, in the year 1994, was to deride the Right for its refusal to indulge in fatty foods.

In all his work, he defended the "bitter nut of solitude in the bonbon of experience": "I play a lot of solitaire.  I guess you could say my Oeuvre is solitaire.  I've even got it on my palm pilot."  Confounder of talking and scribbling, drinker of the elan vitale, transcender of history, a doorway and a wall, mystic, ontologue.

Mallarme and Kafka were the ones who had to entertain him most of the time, let him know he wasn't dead yet (though mortal, mortal and solitary!), haunt his dreams, etc.  Also Nietzsche, Sade, Rilke: he analyzed the bunch of them, in a manner always unbloused and singular, a real Penseur who cooked up the notion of "literary vacant space (your ad here)."

How is scribbling still possible?  His question, not mine, posed in 1942 when he and his pals were thinking about getting out of the game.  He shows us, in essays, novels, gab, in work that is more and more choppy and piecemeal, the advantage of being inscrutable.  It's not the obligation of a paradoxical Frenchman to explain himself.  Not the least of his paradoxes was that he left a complete work, an infinite work, riches beyond hope, yet denied the existence of same.

This is sugar extracted from [BUXOM]' clos:

First, we extruded a red ground-meat-afro from the Ronald McDonald =
Language
Puppet, then came the various medusans.

Medusan1:

This medusan's head is covered in greased eye-sockets.=20
Eyeballs jet from the sockets. This is a low-grade medusa.
Recycled.

Medusan2:

This medusan's head is chemicomechanical and has an array of constantly
reconfiguring extrusion ports. The extrusion products are randon
combinations of materials but the morphology is always similar,=20
strings of jumbled 3-d letters surrounded by a gelatinous
non-toxic chromatic yolk-maa/t/erial. The letter-cores are hard yet =
flexible. These are non-edible
whip-like letter cores. The letter cores also exhibit a form of =
dactylolysis
spontanea, bankokerend, sukhapakla, Ainhum, or autoamputation and can be =
used=20
for ropes, belts, whips, turbans, and architectural ornamentation.

Medusan3:

This medusan is spherical and grows golden erectile metallic hair at a =
rate
of 1' per sec. It also travels at 1.618km/sec and is sometimes=20
called the auricomus glomeroluxuria.

Medusan4:

This medusan is stationary and is worshipped in a secret=20
grotto dug deep into the *great* crater of  Emi Koussi, the highest=20
of the Tibesti mountains of Tchad in the Central Sahara. Its
structural iconography is of that found in the "round head"=20
(i.e. 9,000 - 7,000 years ago) style of rock art of the Ennedi=20
region of Tchad, which is related to styles primarily found in=20
Tin-Tazarift at Tassili (Algeria), Tadrart Acacus (Libya), and,=20
to a lesser extent, at Jebel Uweinat (Egypt), but is a completely unique =
specimen.
This Medusan was carved, or partially carved, and/or augmented by =
erosion, in situ,=20
and resembles a giant horned bird-goddess holding what looks=20
to be a large mushroom in her left hand. Ostensibly, the Mushroom=20
"is" the medusan, and extrudes a curly fur of tiny hallucinogenic ice
helicites. It seems that beneathe the sacred ikon lies a curious set of=20
circumstances allowing this phenomenon. First, there
is a spring and/or and underground reservoir.* Second, the mineral=20
structure of the area restricts evaporation and miraculously forms a =
unique
conduit up through the goddess' form and out through the "round head" =
"mushroom" totem.**
Third, the microclimate, and structure of the cave and its altitude all =
act in a "geophusic"=20
combination to form extruded icicles, or ice helicites.*** Fourth, a =
rare form of=20
underground mycology is present and growing through the same channels=20
as the water/ice being extruded as helicites, or sacred ice-hair.=20

Randolph,

I have not been idle. You said I could expand the book, and I set out to
write a companion piece to Near or Random Acts. Initially I wanted it also
to include 70 sections, and have it closely parallel, even comment on, the
first 70. Very quickly, I abandoned that, and made it an entirely different
poem, although one that, at least formally, comments on the other, as its
70, far from being the neatly contained parts of the first, are often
interrupted by parenthetical remarks, include much of the process of their
composition in those remarks, some of which are as mundane as comments on
the transition from illegible notebooks to the finished poem, some of which
are essential in other ways. I wanted, in some way, to break the surface of
the poem, in to the writer and out to the reader. I'm not quite finished,
but have only 9 sections (and possible interruptions) left to go. A couple
of friends have commented on the work in ways that have helped, and one of
those sets of comments I need to go over again and see if it makes me want
to change anything else.  I'll send the whole to you as soon as I am
finished, which should be very soon, perhaps within a week.

all best wishes,

Charles

O Poetiques:

sorry for the hyper impersonal request below, spammed earlier (meant mostly
for people in Tucson).  But a number of people on this list have in fact
appeared in or attended POG events at least once--so I'm hoping a few people
will volunteer to fill out the short survey (to request an email survey,
send to mailto:pog@gopog.org ).

thanks,

I 'm entering this conversation midstream.  But wondering why the need to
compare?  Whitman gives permission for modernisms to exist.  He gives us the
long-legged line, the possibility of marrying the lyric with the narrative,
which in turn takes about 120 years to really produce some fearless poets who
are women.  When Jose Marti reports on his writing and person to Cuba, he
brings him to the Spanish speaking world--surely WW is part of an
international lineage.  And see Muriel Rukeyser's essay on Whitman, as well
as June Jordan's.  Levertov owes much to WW.  Any of Notley's "Dr. Williams
Heiresses," including Bernadette Mayer could be compared, if you really need
to.

Best, Gloria Frym

Mime-Version: 1.0

I’d like to let you know how our Barbaric Yawps in Baltimore went down.
Please forgive cross-posting.

As a result of discussion on the Poetics list regarding the absence of
panels at the AWP annual conference in Baltimore addressing the urgent
current issue of threatened war against Iraq, and the range of published
responses from poets, a group of poets committed themselves to
presenting an open reading in Baltimore.  We were initially unable to
secure a venue at the conference hotel, the Renaissance Harborplace, as
the program was already set and all spaces taken.  The Enoch Pratt Free
Library at 400 Cathedral Street, about a mile from the hotel, offered us
their Edgar Allan Poe Room.  On Friday February 28th, 11am-1.45pm, 12
poets participated in the event.

I kicked off with a brief questioning of Stanley Fish’s recent argument
in The Chronicle of Higher Education “that no university, and therefore
no university official, should ever take a stand on any social,
political, or moral issue,” Laura Bush’s assertion that "There is
nothing political about American literature," and Dana Gioia’s claim
that “the urge to politicize art proves irresistible to the ignorant,
the lazy, and the small-minded of all persuasions.”  James Cervantes
countered Stanley Fish’s argument also, and read his poem from the 100
Poets Against the War site, and which will be coming out in a book from
Salt (U.K. & Australia) in March. Pierre Joris delicately sketched
reminders of the phenomenal tradition of  Arab poetry, including a
modernism which preceded Western modernism by 800 years.  Kazim Ali
performed several Yoko Ono pieces, one of which led us to listen to one
another’s heartbeats.  Jane Sprague presented on Ammiel Alcalay’s
“Poetry, Politics and Translation: American isolationism & The Middle
East,” the first publication of her Palm Press.  Wendy Carlisle read
three poems, one a ghazal.  Gabriel Gudding delivered an impromptu sound
poem collaged from the names of members of the Bush cabinet; he also
read his poem “Cadenza,” dedicated to the civil libertarians of 9/11.
Halvard Johnson read two poems.  Patrick Herron, needing only a pork-pie
hat and cane to be a dapper song-and-dance man, led us in “Happy
Birthday to Us” (since sent to the Poetics list).  Toni Asante Lightfoot
spoke on the responsibilities of poets/teachers, and read a poem.
Finally Anastasios Kozaitis related a story about how poems were written
and “published” by Vietnamese soldiers (please correct me if I’m wrong
here, Anastasios), and also read a poem.  I found the event substantial
and satisfying.  The audience was small, the room very beautiful and
full of treasures, including one large format John Ashbery collaborative
book which was passed around.  Edgar Allan Poe looked down on all
throughout.

In the days before the AWP conference, and as a result of an
intervention by Kazim Ali and a panel cancellation, David Fenza made a
room available to us at the Renaissance Harborplace, and included our
event on the conference program.  As a result, we presented a panel in
the St. George Room, 2.30-4pm on Friday February 28, right after the
Enoch Pratt Free Library event.  I introduced and moderated this
presentation, in which Toni Asante Lightfoot, Jane Sprague, Pierre
Joris, Gabriel Gudding and Kazim Ali participated, offering a variation
of the program presented that morning, and speaking more directly to the
issue of American poet/teachers’ capacities and responsibilities in
relation to current foreign policy.  This session was fairly well
attended and there was vigorous discussion between panelists and
audience members, focusing on conflicting perceptions of media coverage
of preparation for war, and popular protests.

Personally, I found both sessions productive
in terms of making art and also answering the question, “What can we do?”
 Pierre emphasized our ability and responsibility to break down
town-and-gown divisions; he also spoke to the relevance of familiarizing
ourselves with the great tradition of Arab poetry, and contemporary
work.  The words of Ammiel Alcalay, quoted by Jane Sprague in the Enoch
Pratt Free Library on Friday morning, also persist as a challenge in
terms of establishing links with our colleagues and fellow poets in the
Middle East:

“…there is a remarkable, remarkable divorce between the intellectual
life of the United States and the intellectual life of the so-called
Middle East.  I mean, it is a remarkable, remarkable lack of—first of
all, there’s ignorance, there’s a lack of any sense of empathy,
solidarity, sympathy, etc.  Particularly given the fact that the
intellectual class of that part of the world is, as a class, an
oppressed class, a species in danger.  And it’s remarkable in thinking
about that, when one, for instance, uses the rhetoric of human rights,
and thinks about a report on human rights, one’s first reaction is to be
angry, shocked, etc. at the extent of the repression by the regime in
question rather than to think of that as an index of the extent of
resistance that is being carried out.  And particularly in the Middle
East, this is something that is actually quite shocking, I think, in
terms of the total lack of communication, of interconnectivity between
those individuals, groups, etc. in that part of the world and people
here.  And again, I’m referring particularly to intellectuals, writers,
academics, cultural figures, and so on.”  (from “Poetry, Politics, and
Translation: American isolation & The Middle East,” Palm Press 2003).

Thanks to all participants in presentations and discussions; also to
Carolyn Delly and the Enoch Pratt Free Library, and David Fenza and the
AWP.

Lo
Girl writes English essay in phone text shorthand
By Auslan Cramb, Scottish Correspondent
(Filed: 03/03/2003)

Education experts warned yesterday of the potentially damaging effect on
literacy of mobile phone text messaging after a pupil handed in an essay
written in text shorthand.

The 13-year-old girl submitted the essay to a teacher in a state secondary
school in the west of Scotland and explained that she found it "easier than
standard English".

Her teacher, who asked not to be named, said: "I could not believe what I
was seeing. The page was riddled with hieroglyphics, many of which I simply
could not translate."

The Scottish Qualifications Authority has expressed concern about the
problem in its report on last year's Standard Grade exams, and revealed tha=
t
"text messaging language was inappropriately used" in the English exam.

Judith Gillespie, of the Scottish Parent Teacher Council, said a decline in
standards of grammar and written language was partly linked to the craze.
"There must be rigorous efforts from all quarters of the education system t=
o
stamp out the use of texting as a form of written language so far as Englis=
h
study is concerned.

"There has been a trend in recent years to emphasise spoken English. Pupils
think orally and write phonetically. You would be shocked at the numbers of
senior secondary pupils who cannot distinguish between their and there. The
problem is that there is a feeling in some schools that pupils' freedom of
expression should not be inhibited."

Dr Cynthia McVey, a psychology lecturer at Glasgow Caledonian University,
said texting was second nature to a generation of young people. "They don't
write letters, so sitting down to write or type an essay is unusual and
difficult. They revert to what they feel comfortable with - texting is
attractive and uncomplicated."

The teenager's essay began: "My smmr hols wr CWOT. B4, we usd 2go2 NY 2C my
bro, his GF & thr 3 :- kds FTF. ILNY, it's a gr8 plc." Translation: "My
summer holidays were a complete waste of time. Before, we used to go to New
York to see my brother, his girlfriend and their three screaming kids face
to face. I love New York, it's a great place.

Friends,

I wrote an anti-war poem, submitted it to poetsagainstthewar.org, and it was
REJECTED. I sumbitted it two more times with minor alterations, NO LUCK. They
have accepted 12,000 poems, most of them horse shit, but they REJECTED mine!  I
even emailed the editors, who wrote back that it had been submitted three times
and not posted to the website, that they would check into it.  That was a WEEK
ago.

For those curious, I will append the poem in question. Is this a BAD POEM?  I
think not. Nah, I think it's proof positive that officious CENSORSHIP afflicts
even the GOONS at poetsagainstthewar.org.  What a crock!

Luv,

Lo
Girl writes English essay in phone text shorthand
By Auslan Cramb, Scottish Correspondent
(Filed: 03/03/2003)

Education experts warned yesterday of the potentially damaging effect =
on
literacy of mobile phone text messaging after a pupil handed in an =
essay
written in text shorthand.

The 13-year-old girl submitted the essay to a teacher in a state =
secondary
school in the west of Scotland and explained that she found it "easier =
than
standard English".

Her teacher, who asked not to be named, said: "I could not believe what =
I
was seeing. The page was riddled with hieroglyphics, many of which I =
simply
could not translate."

The Scottish Qualifications Authority has expressed concern about the
problem in its report on last year's Standard Grade exams, and revealed =
that
"text messaging language was inappropriately used" in the English exam.

Judith Gillespie, of the Scottish Parent Teacher Council, said a =
decline in
standards of grammar and written language was partly linked to the =
craze.
"There must be rigorous efforts from all quarters of the education =
system to
stamp out the use of texting as a form of written language so far as =
English
study is concerned.

"There has been a trend in recent years to emphasise spoken English. =
Pupils
think orally and write phonetically. You would be shocked at the =
numbers of
senior secondary pupils who cannot distinguish between their and there. =
The
problem is that there is a feeling in some schools that pupils' freedom =
of
expression should not be inhibited."

Dr Cynthia McVey, a psychology lecturer at Glasgow Caledonian =
University,
said texting was second nature to a generation of young people. "They =
don't
write letters, so sitting down to write or type an essay is unusual and
difficult. They revert to what they feel comfortable with - texting is
attractive and uncomplicated."

The teenager's essay began: "My smmr hols wr CWOT. B4, we usd 2go2 NY =
2C my
bro, his GF & thr 3 :- kds FTF. ILNY, it's a gr8 plc." Translation: "My
summer holidays were a complete waste of time. Before, we used to go to =
New
York to see my brother, his girlfriend and their three screaming kids =
face
to face. I love New York, it's a great place.

:my best friend
listens all the time to the radio and television, she knows what the war
is all about, i don't know what the war is all about. so i ask her and she
tells me and it's all right. we decide the only thing that would work is
some other person being president fast and we can't remember how far down
people would have to die before that person brings an end to the horror.
and i can't sleep at night now and no one i know has a job and we're
victims and we repeat the same old stories all the time and nothing takes
away the pain. this country has nothing to do with us, this is a new
country and an old assyria country. please help us and tell us what to
do.:saviorsavior:saviorhero

:you can't do anything
now, you have to know that. thinking about people dying is against the law
and our president will live forever and no one will have to vote again
which is okay because very few voted before if you remember. almost no one
voted before but those who did had to brave the weather. now we have to
brave the war under our president but that is easy because our president
tells us what we have to do. please remember there is no horror and there
will be no horror. this is a new country and an old hittite country and
our president is our servant and we are his presidents.

:thank you for your point
of view, i now can sleep easier and i know my best friend is wrong, and
thank you for making the radio and television. we know what the war is
about and she is not speaking now and she has left. it is all right and i
cannot sleep because of worry from her but i sleep soon and i will not
have to speak to her.

REJECTION LETTER


$text = "You call this an anti-war poem? It's missing a single reference to
war or fighting or political action. Most of it sounds meaningless to me,
like you picked the words from a dictionary at random. Heck it doesn't even
rhyme! My baby nephew could do better than this. Heck, my cat could do
better than this, and I don't even own a cat! I wish poets would stop
writing such drivel. It really gives poetry a bad name, and taints the
entire profession. Think if you were submitting this to a congress of
mathematicians: You would be laughed out of the groves of academe. Your work
lacks any rigor that might be defended. It lacks any logical development. It
contains no expressions of feeling. Heck, it doesn't even qualify as
interesting nonsense! What is more, I find it disgusting. Go back to the
drawing board. Go back to the woodshed. Go back to square one. Whatever you
do, stop writing poems! Heck, I'd even pay you to stop, if I thought it
would work! But something tells me you are obsessed, and once that happens
it is hopeless to change one's mind. ***************";

I dream of shooting you,

full, heavy, veins following
history as it rots on our eyes.

I dream you fall over with a
"yes, sir!"  There's just not

that much more to it:

light ripples through trees
like laughter in a fall-out
shelter, probing slow fecund buds
for the clutch of meaning. It roars

like airplanes in our hearts. Feeling
is one way to fly without wormwort
or totality, frequent miles tuned in
to our eyes blossum'd with temporary

sentiment, and
these bodies were made to fit

like this. Your breath such soft

bullets on my skin. I dream you
rain on me, alone in my endowment:

I'd kill to be a genius, to ride
planes from one side of the room
to the other, high above
the dirty workers and their beer

in cans, erased from daily
conversing. Instead I convert
file extensions. I memorex
the protocol. I dream

of shooting you down so you fall on me,
who stands here straining up with an open mouth.

Global Launch of Peace Protest Anthology

‘100 Poets Against the War’  is the fastest poetry anthology ever assembled
and disseminated, taking just 6 weeks from being an idea to becoming a book.
Since its publication, the book has featured in The Times, Le Monde, and
Liberation. Poets have been interviewed and the book covered on CNN. It is
being launched through a series of events, including in London, Los Angeles,
Paris, Ottawa, Montreal and Austin, Texas.

***

Please Note:

This anthology has grass-roots legitimacy, emerging out of the peace
protest, being performed and read at marches around the world by living
poets.

This book is written by leading contemporary poets and peace activists who
continue to take part in the global peace protest and the many events
associated with it.

This book is not for profit and all trading surplus will be donated to
Amnesty International. This anthology does not exploit the situation for
corporate profit.

This book is specifically about the impending war in Iraq, about today's
issues and does not deflect attention away from this particular crisis.

This book supports the protest against war in Iraq and has been compiled by
people active in, and committed to, the peace movement.

"the carrier is ready to leave, with thousands of americans ready for
war." (WCBS)

my friend and i think we will die in the next two months, from some as yet
unknown violence. new york is under furious regimens, the alert level
remaining high in spite of the rest of the country. almost everyone i know
is out of work. george bush rides hard with the shield of his presidency
into other countries; we have become a traditional 19th-century colonial
power overnight. i fear disappearing, the sudden knock at the door, the
brute force of anonymous men. every text i write points to my guilt in
this and every other matter. america has transformed within the hour;
there will be no next election, as the country is placed under trumped up
emergency powers. the soldiery already sides with bush; every evening,
patriotic soldiers, who have never voted anyway, appear on the evening
news. new york will have the highest building in the world, in five years,
another target, as the city continues its doomed path to armageddon. we
are certain there is nuclear material here, ready to explode. i no longer
sleep at night, instead replaying the rhetoric of massacre and slaughter i
hear daily on the radio. the government has become monolithic, the
president listening to three or four men at the most. the cadre is
inspired by god and the mission of god. the country is held captive, as we
protest, realizing only violence will end violence, only slaughter will
end slaughter. as citizens we live in confusion and anxiety, watching our
nightmares turn real. we have abandoned the community of the world, the
internet a pale reminder of what we might have been. smiling earnest
troops are filmed leaving on enormous carriers. we offer billions in aid
to countries that accept our troops, while the stock market continues to
crash here, and the number of homeless rapidly increases. the nation is
thrown off balance, all formal energy tending towards military action. it
is hard to focus as we walk in fear of domestic terrorists from above,
other terrorists from within. for the first time we live in absolute
impotency, speaking to ourselves, waiting for everything and nothing at
all. this morning i saw two flashes, then nothing. sometimes there are
sounds. the meaninglessness of the world asserts itself at every turn. we
will not have to wait much longer, we will wait forever. the cadre has the
names, and dates. the cadre is absolute, and every absolute is evil.

Subject:      A.Word.A.Day--elliptical
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII

elliptical (i-LIP-ti-kuhl) adjective (also elliptic)

   1. Pertaining to or having the shape of an ellipse.

   2. Marked by ellipsis (omitting words).

   3. Characterized by extreme economy of expression in speech or writing;
      cryptic or ambiguous.

[From Greek elleiptikos (defective), from elleipsis (to come short),
from leipein (to leave). The word eclipse has the same root.]

  "What did he and the truck earn in a typical year? A good year? His
   responses were strictly elliptical."
   John Mcphee; A Fleet of One; The New Yorker; Feb 17, 2003.

  "He (Warren Beatty) has written a somewhat elliptical piece for the New
   York Times condemning the grip of big money on American politics, and has
   another piece coming out in the Los Angeles Times."
   Warren Beatty's Profession; Economist (London, UK); Sep 4, 1999.

Why in the world would three seemingly unrelated phenomena -- a plane curve,
a punctuation mark, and a writing style -- be represented by a single word?
A glance at the etymology and everything falls in place. The common thread
here is `shortfall': whether an ellipse, a shape that falls short of being
a circle; a sentence that is short of a few words; or terse writing.
Let's peruse a few more words about words that also apply to math (US) or
maths (elsewhere).

MECCA-COLA MIMICS COKE; SALES SUPPORT PALESTINIANS
Marketer Urges World's Consumers to 'Think Before They Drink'
February 24, 2003
By Bill Britt
http://www.adage.com/news.cms?newsId=37207

LONDON (AdAge.com) -- A new soft drink that mimics Coca-Cola's
branding and promises 20% of its profits to Palestinian and Muslim
charities is riding a wave of publicity and anti-American sentiment
here.

Anti-war march

Mecca-Cola, a soft drink which launched in France last November,
scored a recent public relations coup by dubbing itself sponsor of
the 1 million-strong peace march in London on Feb. 15. Marchers
were handed 36,000 bottles of the cola and 10,000 t-shirts with the
Mecca-Cola logo and the message "Stop the War" and "Not in my
Name."

In a stunt visible to those watching the demonstration on TV in
London, a vehicle topped with a 20-foot-high Mecca-Cola can pulled
a trailer with an outdoor board saying "All human beings are born
free and equal ... and should think before they drink."

The stunt earned Mecca-Cola this reference in London's Sunday
Times: "The drink now seen as politically preferable to Pepsi or
Coke."

U.S. policy as advertising

"I might come to advertising in a year or two, but right now Mr. Bush
is making our advertising with all his aggression and his war logic,"
said Tawfik Mathlouthi, Mecca-Cola's founder.

Before Mecca-Cola's launch Mr. Mathlouthi, a Tunisian-born
businessman who moved to France in 1977, was best known as the
founder 12 years ago of Paris' first ethnic radio station. Mecca-Cola
is run from a Paris office staffed by a team of eight. Distribution is
mainly through corner shops in the communities where Britain's 1.5
million Muslims are concentrated.

"I have no problem with Western products," Mr. Mathlouthi said.
"Cola is a symbol of imperialism. ... I'm targeting the symbol and the
politics."

Mimics Coke branding

Mecca-Cola's packaging is the one that looks like the all-American
Coca-Cola. Mecca-Cola Classic is spelled out in white on red cans,
pictured on MeccaCola.com, along with the promise that 20% of
profits go to Palestinian and Muslim charities.

Atlanta-based Coca-Cola Co. declined to comment.

Since November, Mecca-Cola claims to have sold 800,000 1.5-liter
bottles in the U.K. and the same number in France, plus another 1
million bottles in the Middle East and Africa. Another 16 million
bottles have been ordered, and some are heading to the U.S., Mr.
Mathlouthi said. Still, that won't make much of a dent in Coca-Cola
sales. Coca-Cola Britain has 42% of the carbonated soft-drink
market.

Political protest drink

"One has to be respectful of any product which represents a political
or social protest, but in terms of volume and market share, this will
not be a threat to Coca-Cola or Pepsi," said John Sicher, editor of
the trsde publication Beverage Digest.

Mecca-Cola is not alone pursuing the world's 1.5 billion Muslims.
Zam Zam Cola, an Iranian brand, is expanding its distribution. And
Qibla Cola, a name that refers to the direction Muslims face when
praying to Mecca, launched in the U.K. on Feb. 4 with the tagline
"Liberate your taste." Qibla created print and TV ads in-house.

Elegant design.

Alan, your poem brought back one I wrote years ago, based on poem of yours:


YOUR NAME, THIS NET

Traced against the empty,
traced through the header,
it's a waste of the essence
of the body of canons.

Quantum tunnelings are everywhere
artificial, a waste of the deep,
nothing works in the deep.

Line wrap not desire (Spinoza),
not desire (Spinoza), repeaters
and quantum tunnelings are ghosts
crossing through to the Other.

Outside my window only our bodies
have names, as if the last choir's
circulating on the sill of your name.

I look through my window and know
there were lovers in those ashes,
traced against the memories
that hold back the door.

I cry over the threshold,
its empty air, in midst of a shimmer--
dark angels fly with your name.

The project outside my packets
is wrapped in a body of grass:
I have names that fling my pain
over the essence of canons.

Look for your name in the deep,
"you who are about to die,"
in the darkness, and in nothing.

I don't understand this poem. Nor do I understand why my country is poised
to slaughter the Iraqi People. So your poem makes sense, after all, lots of
sense, more sense than any dribble from the mouths of the administration.
You don't lie, you don't make sense, but you don't lie.

Your So-Called Rough-Guides to Interpenduncular Culljur


What skin to mimic saraband when the folds=20
of the gray grease have had us on this way.
Together we shouted *Mother* to the towering
arbor of its indignant reticence, two-handled=20
shovel of jade, vibrating in the invisible drain.
Fourier will transform the mitre of the meter,
when motor's mutter left MIDOR mumming
at the manifold. Now to dearrange a clip.
Deorange. The Orange. The O range.

Freaks of heaven go now to your helmeted, pipe-smoking
tubs. Shelve the piehorn, and clamp explanations
to your five seldom understanding when
irrational comes the window burning, Miss On-scene.
History ended with the Dinosaurs;
What's left is a symphonic scar starring humanity
as an animated afterbirth retelling cosmic angst
in the form of a self-important and polymechanical diorama.
Splay-footed Parkinson, I have no inkling of your political electrolux.

Come Friday, The Cannibals have retired
to their red-skinned lantern maze, slick with grue and mating,
lets us waltz among the palms and sway by the cringing moon.
We are bubbles of now in a primordial soup never done simmering.
They are all Jackal-headed Spokespeople &
are sorting us silently, and the movement will echo=20
the massless proton, a shape in which obliteration finds perfect =
comfort.

This is the profile of a useless exchange rate,

If anyone can help me with the answers to these questions I'd be
immensely grateful.

1. There was an article on Postmodernism (& collage) by David Antin,
published in Boundary 2 probably around 1978.  Can anyone give me
title & reference?

2.  There's a painting by Philip Guston called "Smoking. 1".  If
anyone has a catalogue or large book on him (or they see it
regularly) could they tell me where it is located: the museum & the
city?

I fell I have the answer to the first question: a photocopy of it
somewhere, but I sight it only every 4 or 5 years or so.

Cheers

installation and mixed-media art.  Opening week events include Dinner at the
Crossroads, an interactive performance dinner and installation and Spirit
Stories, an evening of readings by Tisa Bryant and Ana M. Lara.  Artists and

will be performed during the opening week of the show.  Each dinner consists
of a ten-course meal, each course delineated by ritual, music and movement.
During the performance dinners, an audience member will be invited to
experience the rituals of eating as they sit down to eat at the crossroads.

Artists

Tisa Bryant lived and worked for several years in San Francisco, where she
was a visual and literary arts curator, and conducted writing workshops in
elementary schools, colleges and prisons.  Her work has recently appeared in
Bombay Gin and Cross Cultural Poetics, and in the anthologies Beyond the
Frontier (Black Classics Press, 2002), Hatred of Capitalism (semiotext(e),
2002), Long Journey Home (The Women's Press, UK, 2002), Short Fuse
(Rattapallax Press, 2002) and Step Into a World (John Wiley & Sons, 2001).
Her chapbook, Tzimmes was published by A+Bend Press in 2000.  She is
currently completing an MFA in fiction at Brown University.



Ana M. Lara is a writer and performance artist.  Her work focuses on the
modern day dilemmas resulting from the Middle Passage between Africa and the
Caribbean.  Her work attempts to redefine the concept of freedom through the
lens of African ancestral memory and Dominican history.



Niki Lee is an Arikara traditional bead worker as well as a visual artist at
home using acrylics and oil sticks.  While her favorite surface to date is
masonite, she has been commissioned to do in-home murals in the Bay Area.
Lee has been painting and scribbling since she can remember.  In addition to
her sought after horses, Lee has developed a biting body of work commenting
on the violence of contemporary society.



Wura-Natasha Ogunji was born in St. Louis, Missouri of American and Nigerian
parents.  She sees the art-making process as a kind of ritual that allows
her to tell stories and translate memories into visual language.  Working
with photography, sewing, installation and performance she often draws from
materials used in traditional Yoruba ceremonies.  Her work seeks to
understand the ways in which we conceptualize history and record memory.






Another world is not only possible, she is on her way. Sometimes when I
stand still, I can smell her.

well, there it is, in green and weird constraining dialogue, as if marching
to Pretoria in the dead of day. you can do anything, but, framing the
assistance with same day service. like. when we were pastures, trickling off
language's edge. didn't we have a place in love? and wasn't love itself
truly rolling in the afternoon of voice? so that, please, the discussion
realizes its own perception. children are hurt. it's my fault. there are
scads in the day, each lost in voice. as we, so proud and truly, stand over
the situational ethic, have we decided? it's a hippie lifestyle gone wry and
complete. only music has our real voice, says the impassioned date of
everything. it won't be only a thrill but a magistrate with louder drums.
and the kindness that we surely cannot approximate starts another onslaught
of discussion and true. or so true as when we need it. such war zone
tactics, when our voice is habitat. our voice, and the way children, and how
the people have been all along. namely. it is in these quiet, suggestive so
you please.

meant peace of a second nature, a considered pearl. lay away then lift off
the construction, spiraling in spaces that can have description, provided
there are words enough. words are sports of declaration, and, while we rest,
the terms clear from the project. a little room remains. often there are
tunes of such ridiculous constancy, like the growth of treasure in one's
mind. there is even a selling of ramparts, to keep your buddies impressed.
everyone talks about the looseness of language, there in the cage. it
appears that the things that matter are a bunch of names foaming off to the
side. the picture, then, and the vigourous wing that makes another place,
these surely are reference ranks, well amassed in the big picture. please
just send situations to their makers, in the words of any old day.

Ken, I know this is not the issue you're looking for, but looking through
some back issues I found that the Spring 1975 issue on oral poetry has "what
am i doing here?" by Antin along with a correspondence among Antin, Spanos,
and Robert Kroetsch and an essay by Barry Alpert called "Post-Modern Oral
Poetry: Fuller, Cage, and Antin." This in addition to work by Rothenberg,
Economou, Dennis Tedlock, Eshelman, Enslin, Goldbarth, and Yannis Ritsos.

Sitting next to it on my shelf were the HUGE Creeley issue (570 pages in
1975, almost as big as Creeley's Collected 1945-1975) and the
L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E issue from the mid-80s. All of which I bring up for no other
reason than to remark what a great job Bill Spanos did. He surely is one of
the most underappreciated figures in postmodern literature.

If anyone can help me with the answers to these questions I'd be
immensely grateful.

1. There was an article on Postmodernism (& collage) by David Antin,
published in Boundary 2 probably around 1978.  Can anyone give me
title & reference?

2.  There's a painting by Philip Guston called "Smoking. 1".  If
anyone has a catalogue or large book on him (or they see it
regularly) could they tell me where it is located: the museum & the
city?

I fell I have the answer to the first question: a photocopy of it
somewhere, but I sight it only every 4 or 5 years or so.

Thanks, Brian.  They do sound amazing.  I never saw (I think) any
'Boundaries'.  The thing I did like from that period were Alpert's
VORT specials.

Thanks for looking into it for me.

reminiscent of publish or perish & other chapbook exchanges --





The 2nd Annual Poetry Super Highway

Great Poetry Exchange

The mission of the Poetry Super Highway

is to expose as many people to as many

other people's poetry as possible.



What?

In February 2003, the Poetry Super Highway will coordinate a great free
exchange of poetry publications amongst poets worldwide.



It's not a contest. There are no judges, entry fees, winners, or losers.



Last year, 63 poets participated both sending their book and receiving
another poet's book from a randomly selected other participant



By agreeing to participate, someone will be exposed to your poetry, and
you will be exposed to someone else's poetry.





How?

To participate you must volunteer to mail one copy of one poetry book
that you have written to one other person participating. Just one book.
In exchange, you will receive in the mail one copy of one poetry book
written by another participating poet.



Please not e-books are not eligible for the Great Poetry Exchange. Your
book must be physical entity. Even if it's self published, or one of one
that you printed from your computer and stapled together...but no
e-books.



E-mail GPE@PoetrySuperHighway.com



Include in your e-mail:



The title of your book



A description of your book no longer than 50 words.



Your name



Your mailing address



Your website address (if you have one.)



In the middle of March, we will randomly assign the books to each
participant and email to you the name and address of the person you are
supposed to send your book to.

We will also list your book and description on this web page along with
the link to your website for all to see. In addition we will list the
new books in our weekly e-mailed update which goes out to thousands of
people.

Please note, as the Great Poetry Exchange is open to everyone on planet
Earth, it's possible that you will be required to send your book to
someone outside of your own country which will, of course cost you more
in postage than it would to send it domestically.

Also. we'll ask that you send us an e-mail in March once your book has
actually been sent so we can keep track and make sure that all
participants who send a book also get one.

You also must agree to send out your book within 2 weeks of being
notified of who to send your book to .

Subject:      Viscoelastic Behaviors: "Underdetermining and Undervaluing
              Plasticity as the Primary Property of Aesthetic Semiosis"

ABSTRACT: Clade Determinations of viscoelastic behaviors (creep) within
the field of |contemporary|aesthetic|semiosis|:

This paper explores the possibilities of determining creep parameters
for a simple Tardyon as "Luxon Inertia"  material from indexed creep
testing using semiotic dilatometry. Due to the increasing use of
semiotic plasticity in load bearing constructions an understanding of
the mechanical behaviour of these materials is becoming more important.
Using creep finite element analysis the creep indice test technique is
analysed in terms of indexical rates of specific individuals under
constant language loads. Emphasis is placed on the evolving semiotic
stress distribution in front of the expressive indenter during indice
creep. The measured semiotic strain was modeled with the Leaderman
model with a plastic strain term added for higher stresses. The creep
strain could be adequately described for stresses up to 14 MPa. However
the model predictions of the creep-recovery experiments compared with
measurements indicate that even at low stresses plasticity is present
and that the plasticity at higher stresses is grossly underestimated.
Moreover the complex role of index geometry, size effects and of
macroscopic constraints is explicitly considered. A simple procedure is
proposed to translate indexed creep results into constitutive creep
equations for cases where the dimensions of the tested material are
significantly larger than the indice. The influence of macroscopic
constraints becomes important when the size of the metonymic
ontologue is of the same order of magnitude as the size of the testing
material. As a striking example for size effects and for macroscopic
constraints the indexed creep process in a thin anthrogeological film is
analyzed. The results contribute to a better mechanical understanding of
indexed creep testing. To find a description of viscoelasticity, first
creep experiments at different load levels and some creep-recovery
experiments were performed. The results of the creep tests were
modelled after which the model prediction for the creep-recovery
experiments was compared with the results. Finally conclusions about
further improvement of the model were drawn. It seems that broadly
speaking, the conceptual modeling of the viscoelastic semiocreepic
behaviors were consistently overdetermined and semantically narrow.
Using the G. t' Hoof method of activating ("p-branes") within
the ontology of semiotic meta-accidents we may still recognize the role
of creep (viscoelastic behavior) to conform to a method of stable
production consistent with a modern analysis of the biological
role within the cosmology of the semiosphere.

yours sincerely is alliterative in tempo alongside the grunt. if even this
is the namesake of my cheap shit, let the wails begin. I mean it's like,
tomorrow, when I am amply rewarded, I will still be forcing my name, tho all
the numbers drop. and it, the lark, sure holds plenty of terrain for
jeepers. there is no loose lattice left to report, since iffiness is when I
sign my name. heck, I've gotten more guarded lopsided than YOU, popular cult
of what the heck. so fuck yourself (in polite society) when you can, it's
only a wish fulfillment masquerading and jeer over the telephone. nobody
does nothing anymore, it's just too populated. still, I might be gamin to
try, whilst over your regulation you can just see. shake your parameters
while you can, you are an effort made frumpy.

the Martian from the framework reconsidered. in deleterious perfection, said
Martian piped up, first in preamble, then into deep document. as we
readership listened, it became apparent. all pronouns and little bitty
words, even prepositions, were there. 'there' was a place, then. it was
Martian, for how could the world include? and something was 'said', as far
as saying makes a diff. the Martian most notably, with such trickery, avast!
we saw it coming. and going, like the present wintry days. there is nothing
'left', we decide, figuring children are due for a change. mocking is a
grand solution, the Martian detailed to us, using Morse code for the
anachronistic delight. we read each flashing dot and dash as if it were
certified great music. this is poetry, some wag declared. the Martian gave
few prompts, just a trip to daytime. we're just readership, we all said in
tiny muttering. we're just listening to Martian presentation, as if we could
touch that. the Martian wasn't really smooth, or sailing, only hearing these
safe words. it is a big today we have on our hands. and its political act
fills career in gesture. hey grandma, you're so young.

{    reminiscent of publish or perish & other chapbook exchanges --
{
{
{
{
{
{    The 2nd Annual Poetry Super Highway
{
{    Great Poetry Exchange
{
{    The mission of the Poetry Super Highway
{
{    is to expose as many people to as many
{
{    other people's poetry as possible.
{
{
{
{    What?
{
{    In February 2003, the Poetry Super Highway will coordinate a great free
{    exchange of poetry publications amongst poets worldwide.
{
{
{
{    It's not a contest. There are no judges, entry fees, winners, or losers.
{
{
{
{    Last year, 63 poets participated both sending their book and receiving
{    another poet's book from a randomly selected other participant
{
{
{
{    By agreeing to participate, someone will be exposed to your poetry, and
{    you will be exposed to someone else's poetry.
{
{
{
{
{
{    How?
{
{    To participate you must volunteer to mail one copy of one poetry book
{    that you have written to one other person participating. Just one book.
{    In exchange, you will receive in the mail one copy of one poetry book
{    written by another participating poet.
{
{
{
{    Please not e-books are not eligible for the Great Poetry Exchange. Your
{    book must be physical entity. Even if it's self published, or one of one
{    that you printed from your computer and stapled together...but no
{    e-books.
{
{
{
{    E-mail GPE@PoetrySuperHighway.com
{
{
{
{    Include in your e-mail:
{
{
{
{    The title of your book
{
{
{
{    A description of your book no longer than 50 words.
{
{
{
{    Your name
{
{
{
{    Your mailing address
{
{
{
{    Your website address (if you have one.)
{
{
{
{    In the middle of March, we will randomly assign the books to each
{    participant and email to you the name and address of the person you are
{    supposed to send your book to.
{
{    We will also list your book and description on this web page along with
{    the link to your website for all to see. In addition we will list the
{    new books in our weekly e-mailed update which goes out to thousands of
{    people.
{
{    Please note, as the Great Poetry Exchange is open to everyone on planet
{    Earth, it's possible that you will be required to send your book to
{    someone outside of your own country which will, of course cost you more
{    in postage than it would to send it domestically.
{
{    Also. we'll ask that you send us an e-mail in March once your book has
{    actually been sent so we can keep track and make sure that all
{    participants who send a book also get one.
{
{    You also must agree to send out your book within 2 weeks of being
{    notified of who to send your book to .

Hey rude blukas,

it's about bombs in chem labs, television remotes, and exploding dictionaries.

I'm not saying it's a masterpiece, but is it really bad enough to be cut from
the 12,000 at poetsagainstthewar.org? What are their standards?  After all, it's
POETS against the war, not POEMS against the war.  Don't we get a little
creative latitude?

Masterfully,

Small Press Traffic presents
Cedar Sigo & Edwin Torres
Friday, March 7, 2003 at 7:30 PM

Cedar Sigo's first book of poetry, Goodnight Nurse, was published in 2001 by
Angry Dog Press. He is the editor of Old Gold magazine and his most recent
work appears in the anthology Evidence of the Paranormal (Owl Press, 2002).
Raised on the Suquamish Reservation near Seattle, he studied at The Jack
Kerouac School of Disembodied Poetics, moved to San Francisco in 1999, and
recently starred in the video "Kevin and Cedar." "Trouble in mind, Lord I'm
blue/sworn to this league of poets/as most beloved weakling."

Edwin Torres "is the inventor...the most optimistic, agile poet around,"
writes Brenda Coultas. Torres' latest publication is PLEASE, a CD collection
of new texts, audio poems, soundscapes, and video, recently issued by Faux
Press. Born in the Bronx, Torres' earlier works include the CD Holy Kid (Kill
Rock Stars, 1998) -- which was included in the exhibition The American Century
Part II at the Whitney -- and the book Fractured Humorous (Subpress, 1999).
Check him out online at brainlingo.com. "we were strangers in the same
sentence/I was alien."

When Bush's move on Iraq began, there was talk about The Crusades, and this
sober piece shows how right it was, along with other forces in play. There
are evangelicals who are praying that the war will set off Armageddon. This
is how steeped in madness the whole thing is.

latitude, yes, but not lassitude.  it must truly be embarrassing to be
rejected by an organization that, as far as poetry is concerned, apparently
has  no standards.  one's embarrassment only increases when one protests, and
the response is overwhelming, if not exclusively, negative.   the only out
one is then left with is either to denounce everyone as ignorant and without
a capacity for aesthetic discromination, or to complain bitterly that the
work should have been accepted because it's at least as rotten as everyone
else's.  the choice is yours.  on second thought, there is one other option;
you could splash it with blood -- if you're committed it will be your own --
and send it in as a viz-po piece; then what you're written will be of no
importance.

Subject:      AMAZING letter in defense of poetry by Eileen Myles
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="US-ASCII"
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

Eileen Myles read this letter at a reading she gave at Temple University
recently.  She gave me permission to send it out over the waves, and to
mention that it's also available on her website:  <A
HREF="http://www.eileenmyles.com">http://www.eileenmyles.com</A>
Let's talk about this letter!  --CAConrad

-------------

The following is a letter/column
I sent to the NY Times in response to
Judith Shulevitz's Close Readings column
in the Times on Nov. 24, 2002.

I found Judith Shulevitz's "Sing Muses or Maybe Not" an enraging and
appalling piece both for her to have written and for the Book Review Section
to have run. I was particularly stunned at the end, where after reading
several thousand words about how uncomfortable poetry readings make her
(Well, Judith don't go!-) she then slides into a riff on the superiority of
recorded poetry over live readings and then rising like a grouchy parent,
exhausted from ranting at her kids, she vindictively states: "Best of all,
with recordings, you can always turn them off."

What's the sour grapes about? It seems to me that Shulevitz is peeved at her
own lack of power in relation to live poets reading and so she richly takes
her comfort where she can--on the end page of the Times Book Review. I mean,
this is the ultimate lowbrow-posing-as-highbrow piece-one is treated to
Shulevitz dragging in bits from Orwell's "Poetry and the Microphone" to
support her point. Elsewhere Shulevitz has written to read Orwell is to
admire him-to want to be him. Judith it's been done. And Orwell died in 1950.
And the poetry he spent his life around was always live. Recorded poetry back
then was a new idea, as was poetry on the radio. Live readings today
represent something vastly similar. The happy meeting of live poetry with a
very impoverished human need to hear any speech live, but particularly
rhythmic speech is unstoppable. Judith, people just like it. They really do.
They like to sit communally and hear messages that aren't tinkered with by
the government, or intended to sell a product, or gauged to spin some
denatured piece of information that's already been stripped of dangerous and
alarming content. Poetry is and has been for a while where lots of citizen
get the real and irregular news of how others around them think and feel.
What is so discomforting about that?

Are we next going to be treated to how uncomfortable opera makes Judith
Shulevitz feel-how about theater, performance art, live sports, sex, nature,
travel-I mean why direct a 3000-word tut-tut at a vital and ultimately
populist art form? It occurs to me that Judith Shulevitz's discomfort at
these "speech acts" must have to do with an unexamined inability to
experience another's experience of language without retreating to the score
card--giving or withholding points. The excitement of measurable power.
Judith, at its best the phenomenon you're observing is off the charts. There
is so much out there. There's poetry shows on Broadway, there's the Eminem
movie, 8 Mile, and Bob Holman's new poetry club on the Bowery, then there are
slam teams and open mikes, and queer all-girl open mikes. And traveling
all-girl open mike. There's actually churning life in the ever-expanding
number of writing programs on college campuses, not to mention the chattering
traffic in the official unofficial poetry world--the lining up and breaking
down, and re-naming and disclaiming of the New York school, the language
school, the ever getting-rediscovered beat school. The pleasure of meeting
all this wealth of live speech simply requires a fearless listener. It
invites some kind of aesthetic citizenry. Who will take the bumps as they go.
Yet Shulevitz's praise of Allen Ginsberg's recorded reading of "America"--
describing it as "manic" and "one of the comic masterpieces of the beat era"
is not so much wrong, as totally missing the larger point about Ginsberg and
much of what followed him in poetry--that it was often uproariously funny,
then sad, then biting, then incisive. To characterize Ginsberg reading
"America" as merely comic is to separate the poem (and its reading) from its
frantic power--to change powers. One of the achievements of 20th poetry is
its labile nature-its meaning resides in minute shifts of scale within a
single poem. I personally don't think there's such a thing as "political"
poetry, but each transition--those genre-busting attention shifts are where
the politics drips in, and why the people come. Poetry is for the public and
we, the poets don't know who they are.

And, yes there are terrible readings, bad poets, awful reading styles. All of
these things are entirely true, as they often are about everything,
particularly in the neighborhoods of art because people there are always
making something tentative. You might get there, you might not. How can you
ever know. Poetry is like jazz, in that you go to watch it happen. The more
it's predictable the more you do get "poetry voice," as Judith describes it.
It's a poet putting a predictable rhythm on unpredictable speech. It's
situation of someone getting into a car distractedly, closing the door on
their own coat and then absently hearing its buckle drag for hundreds of
miles. When people started to write in what Williams described as "the
variable foot" they probably did often miss that he was advocating reading
poetry in actual speech rhythms, not poetry voice. It's something in between
that you're hearing, Judith, it's aesthetic failure. It happens. When you
hear poetry voice you're hearing the poet's fear, and I agree with you,
Judith, but, ugh, move on. Don't categorically pronounce that music sucks. I
think you are going to the wrong poetry readings--probably ones selected from
a menu of choices bound up entirely in your comfort-zone in terms of social
group, access and appropriateness i.e. Louise Gluck is the only living poet
you cite. Most art forms would suffer if they were only represented by this
narrow a sampling. And yet you rant on like a specialists. Can you explain to
me this know-nothing attitude towards poetry? Does the Times, say in the art
section, print articles by writers who only like dead painters and the very
sight of new work makes them want to barf. . . Do art critics parade their
opinions across the front of Sunday Arts section telling the world how coffee
table books are really the only way to experience art because-well, gosh, you
can just close the book turn out the light and go to sleep. Good night,
Judith, Good night, America.

Love it, Gabe. And I love road poems in general. But if you really write
as you drive (as described below), the least you could do is to keep us
all fully posted well in advance as to your future trips and itineraries--just
so we'll not be on the same highway at the same time. Ginsberg, I believe,
wrote his road pieces (or spoke them into a tape recorder) while riding,
but not driving, right?

" . . . with one hand tied to the wheel. Certain illegalities must be
practiced simply not to waste time. The trick is to write clearly
without taking one's eyes off the road. A certain open scrawl while
one's eyes are fixed is the only trick to be mastered."

But then I assume Dorn was referring to both off and on-road
composition.  (from _Yellow Lola_)

Aaron,

I'm sorry if I took a rude tone. It just really bothered me that you would accuse an organization of censorship just because they rejected one poem that you wrote. There could be a million reasons for the rejection. Lord knows my own poems have been rejected countless times.

As it happens, I visited the poetsagainstthewar.org site and found this tidbit: "As of March 1st, we are no longer accepting submissions of poetry for publication on this web site."

That may be your problem in a nutshell. Or else the editors did not fancy your contribution. Either way, don't get angry; write more poems!

Peace,
Brennen Lukas

Announcing a webcast group reading & discussion for the new O Books anthology
ENOUGH
by Leslie Scalapino, Heather Fuller, Rod Smith, & Beth Joselow on the radio
program "Roots & Culture: Roots Reggae Music & Politicization"--which airs on
WVAU Wednesday nights, 8 to 10 p.m. eastern standard time.

from Leslie Scalapino:
"ENOUGH, which the editors began to assemble following 9/11 at the start of
the U.S. war on Afghanistan, is a collection of poets whose writings are
interactive with the current time, writing as its matter and syntax not
separate from oppressive conditions and war. In enough, U.S. poets, British,
Palestinian, Iraqi, Israeli, speak back and forth to each other only in the
medium of their art. The editorial basis of enough is that these poets' art
is not separate from their being in the world - and that: Seeing what's
happening is a form of change."

Thanks to everyone who showed up to the Dissociated Writers Project
conference in Baltimore this past weekend. Some of you I actually got a
chance to meet and talk to. If I didn't run into you, my apologies. But
contact me to let me know who you were.

We're definitely going to do it again next year. The same band of houligans
and then some. If you want to get involved, let me know and I'll keep you on
our contact list. We're keeping it punk, which I say just to give you fair
warning. We'll need visual art, web design, publishers, poets, fiction
writers, video art, tattooing, hair stylists, etcetera. If I'm missing
anyone, it's only because I'm tired. All are welcome.

Subject:      A.Word.A.Day--hyperbolic
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII

hyperbolic (hy-puhr-BOL-ik) adjective

   1. Of or pertaining to hyperbole; exaggerating.

   2. Of or pertaining to hyperbola.

[From Greek hyperbole (excess), from hyperballein (to exceed), from hyper-
+ ballein (to throw).]

When you employ hyperbole in your discourse, you are doing what a devil does
(to throw), etymologically speaking. The word devil ultimately comes from
Greek diaballein (to throw across, slander). Some other words that share the
same root are ballistic, emblem, embolism, metabolism, parable, problem,
parabola, and symbol.

  "A short while back, Italy's leading newspaper, Corriere della Sera, ran
   a cartoon that imagined Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi's continuing
   evolution. In the first panel, he was chief of state. In a later panel,
   he was king. Finally, years hence, he morphed into a new-era Napoleon.
   Within the hyperbolic context of satire, it was a fairly apt commentary
   on Mr. Berlusconi's outsize ambitions."

  "One of the ironies to emerge from the midair disintegration of the

   for many people, their first clue that a shuttle mission was under way. ...
   This everyday neglect is worth remarking on, not least because, set
   against its backdrop, the flood of hyperbolic tributes that followed
   Columbia's loss strikes an odd chord."

Arron, I am very troubled by your exclusion. This seems to be a stupid
response as it is not poems against the war, it is poets. I was hoping that
it would turn out that you missed the March 1st deadline.

All the best to you, Geoffrey

I guess you can. Shelley was a revolutionary. He believed in
Perfectability and believed that poets had their part to play in
educating minds enslaved by a class system headed by kings and popes.
He wanted the people in countries occupied by the Hapsburgs to get
free, and he wanted the Hapsburg rulers enslaved by their bad ideas
to become free.

Thanks, Hal. Mark Weiss was telling me in Baltimore over the weekend about
a friend who straps a sketch pad to his steering wheel and draws while
driving. (Bought Rochelle Owens' _New and Selected..._ and Armand
Schwerner's _selected shorter poems_ from Mark's Junction Press table,
which by the way was right next to Dave Baratier's Pavement Saw Press
table. Great to meet them both).

Many people have suggested I use a tape recorder so as not to crash: but
there's something about my eye-hand/aural-imagination cognition that's
essential to me, have to actually be writing. Plus, how do you scratch out
a line of something using a tape recorder?

Am far more circumspect now than I was in the fall about when exactly to
reach down and write. I've driven 47000 miles since June and have seen
dozens of accidents: several burning cars (saw a white Saab burning under
T-Rex sized 30 foot flames north of Columbus in Sept or Oct, a scene that
stayed on my mental retina all the way to Dayton), have seen about 5
accidents actually happen (usually I just see the aftereffects), so I never
write while in heavy traffic now, whereas I was risking that in September.
Have gained great respect for my own fragility.

POSTED: Will be traveling east this Friday March 7th--Saturday the 8th
between Illinois & Rhode Island, between 7 EST and 1:30 AM EST, using 74,
70, 270, 71, 80, 84, 691, 91, 9, and 95. Watch your rearview, I'll be in
the dark blue Echo. I'll be the thin man listening angrily to Sean Hannity.

Good thing you said that; I have checked the poet out, and i can say
that it is the best poem since Keats's odes.

As I recall Barry Alpert published these in the 70s and they were
devoted usually to two authors & consisted of very long interviews
discussing =8A 'the usual': their writing & influences etc.  I have
some dealing with Ken Irby, Gilbert Sorrentino, Ted Berrigan, Anselm
Hollo, David Antin, Jackson Mac Low.

Small Press Distribution (who might then have been called Serendipity
or even Sand Dollar) used to distribute them.

"Mohammed, if he was captured at all on March 1, an increasingly dubious
proposition, was supposedly captured in a Rawalpindi neighborhood known as
Westridge. Hundreds of serving and retired military officers live in the
area. [Washington Post, 3/2/03, Telegraph, 3/3/03] Tariq Ali points out this
is only a few miles from where President Musharraf lives. "This is also
where the general headquarters of the Pakistan army are based. This is also
where the headquarters of military intelligence, the ISI, are based. So it
is quite incredible that if he is who they say he is, that he was literally
living around the corner from these people. There is no way in which the
Inter-Services Intelligence who has worked with these people for a long time
would not have known that..." [Australian Broadcasting Corp., 3/3/03]
Another expert said of Mohammed's arrest, "Those who think they have ISI
protection will stop feeling that comfort level." [Australian Broadcasting
Corp., 3/2/03] Obviously this implies that Mohammed was being protected by
the ISI."

Oh, say can't you see, by the bare dangled light,
What so loudly we nailed with our nighttime's armed reaming?

Whose blood stripes and barbed stars, through the one-sided fight,
O'er the ghettoes we watched, were so violently screaming?

Does the vanquished's dead stare, uranium bursting in air,
Give proof to our night that our flag is still there?

O say, can that blood-spattered banner yet wave
O'er land ruled by blind decree, in a world we enslave?

1. Organizers of Antiwar Movement Plan to Go Beyond Protests (By Glenn
Frankel)
More than 120 activists from 28 countries emerged from an all-day
strategy  session here this weekend with plans not just to protest a
prospective  U.S.-led war against Iraq but to prevent it from
happening. They want to  intensify political pressure on the Bush
administration's closest allies --  the leaders of Britain, Italy and
Spain -- and force them to withdraw their  support, leaving the United
States, if it chooses to fight, to go it alone.  And they intend to
further disrupt war plans with acts of civil disobedience  against
U.S. military bases, supply depots and transports throughout Europe.

2. Mercenary adjectives (By M=AA =C1ngeles Maeso)
Adjectives added to the noun "war" are traitors to peace. The word is
so hard in meaning that it should always appear in brute format, no
other word should line up to hide its nudity. Mercenary adjectives
come alongside of war and disguise it in some way, in what way? In a
whisper, as if to clean the air, surgical, humanitarian, precise,
quick, preventive.. Adjectives, which speak pronounced louder than the
word "war", pulling which pulls them along.

3. A single starting point (By Marco Bersani)
"Two superpowers exist in this world: the United States and public
opinion streaming out into the streets." This was the headline of a
story in the February 18, 2003 issue of the New York Times. On the day
after February 15th, 2003, which saw the mobilization of 110 million
people in at least 700 cities around the globe, there seems to be
clear proof that the movement against neoliberal globalization is for
the first time affirmed as a global issue capable of inspiring
mobilization at a planetary level in historically unprecedented
quantitative and qualitative dimensions.

4. Making Globalization equitable (By ATTAC Deutschland, DGB (German
Federation of Trade Unions), VENRO (Association of German Development
NGOs))
This declaration demands that the new Federal Government and the newly
elected Bundestag take on greater commitment for a socially and
ecologically more equitable world order with a democratic countenance.
The declaration is the result of an intensive debate carried out over
the past two years concerning the political challenges of
globalization. At the same time DGB, VENRO and ATTAC demonstrate with
this declaration that they and their respective member organizations -
in spite of the existing differences of  their respective social
policy fields of action - wish to  actively support and co-design this
process jointly as actors in civil society. Representatives of the
Forum Umwelt und Entwicklung, the Forum Menschenrechte and of the
Social Watch Deutschland-Forum Welt-sozialgipfel, which also uphold
the fundamental objectives of this declaration, also took part in
drawing up this declaration.

Mercenary adjectives
____________________________________________________________

By M=AA =C1ngeles Maeso

Adjectives either add life, or take life (El adjetivo, cuando no da
vida, mata (Huidobro)

Adjectives added to the noun "war" are traitors to peace. The word is
so hard in meaning that it should always appear in brute format, no
other word should line up to hide its nudity. Mercenary adjectives
come alongside of war and disguise it in some way, in what way? In a
whisper, as if to clean the air, surgical, humanitarian, precise,
quick, preventive.. Adjectives, which speak pronounced louder than the
word "war", pulling which pulls them along.

Words such as "war", "bomb", "freedom" or "justice" only need
pronouncing for the full impact of their meaning to hit clearly and
precisely. We are left wondering why the adjective was added to call
the war "preventive", the bomb "ecological", justice "infinite" and
freedom "lasting". Why do we add these adjectives? Adjectives either
add life, or take life, warns Huidobro. Do these adjectives, lining up
with such strong nouns, add life?

Who wouldn't feel that threat of any one of the above word pairs?
"Preventive war", "Lasting freedom", "Infinite justice", "Ecological
bomb"... Any speaker used to using his or her own language with real
meaning feels the inherent contradiction nagging in his or her mind.
It simply hurts to hear these terms. Anything can be said, lies and
truth take up the same space. And this lack of meaning, we ask
ourselves, are these contradictions acceptable? Are we facing words
without sense?

Words, all words, have meaning, but do these semantic pairs have? We
know what these nouns mean, we know what every single one of these
nouns and adjectives means, but why does their union appear
unacceptable?

Infinite justice, lasting freedom, do these pairs have any real
meaning?

If we use the word "justice" we consider one of the four cardinal
virtues distributing what each party merits. It doesn't need to be
infinite. What does this addition mean exactly? The word "infinite"
adds connotations which are overly excessive and reduce the impact of
justice. It seems obvious that such excessive justice cannot be fair.
If "Infinite justice" was a short-lived motto, it was precisely
because it sounded just a bit too arrogant, like a tremendous
vengeance from above. "Infinite justice" was rapidly replaced just
weeks later by "Lasting freedom", not, however, to avoid offending
Muslims who consider that only Allah may distribute this type of
justice as the new motto kept to its religious references.

In the same way, "freedom" doesn't include conditions for application.
Then how is the "lasting" supposed to work? By adding "lasting",
"freedom" loses in strength. Are we talking about conditional freedom
then?

"Preventive war", "Ecological bomb", "humanitarian catastrophe"

Are we talking about oxymora such as "Burning ice, chilling fire" ("Es
hielo abrasador, es fuego helado")... from one of Quevedo's sonnets?
No. An oxymoron is the use of two words or expressions of opposite
meaning in the same syntax giving a new meaning. The meaning
transmitted by the sonnet of Quevedo on love is a mix of emotions
coming together in a flood of passion. The use of rhetorical semantics
amplifies the meaning of each predicate for love by using two opposing
terms. How is the meaning of "preventive war" amplified? Is this a
warning of something to anyone wishing to use this something? Do we
hear the warning aiming at somebody starting war that a war is coming?
We hear the word war and we think death, can anybody imagine killing
somebody to avoid death? Obviously not. "Preventive war" does not have
this idea of amplified meaning found in oxymora, and neither do
"ecological bomb" or "humanitarian catastrophe". We are facing a
simple absence of meaning, zero signification.

If amplified meaning is not used, are we dealing with irony? Irony is
used in literary texts to say the opposite of what is actually said.
With these pairs, we do not understand what is said. How can we look
for a second meaning to zero signification if we don't understand the
initial meaning?

These pairs combine words in a repugnant way, a bit like the "round
square" of Ortega y Gasset. Linguistic combinations may be
grammatically logical, but semantically unacceptable. These
expressions have no meaning, no signification. Bernard Noel calls this
regular use of semantics censorship, i.e. the deprival of meaning.

This is war talk. One of us has to die.

An expression only has meaning if its presence is not completely based
on context, in what context would these expressions gain meaning? We
have called these adjectives mercenary because they go to war beating
in a soldier's heart. Those at war create war talk, living in an
absence of meaning. With these contradictory expressions, without
meaning, one word defeats the other: "Ecological bomb", "humanitarian
catastrophe", "preventive war"; both words cannot remain together. The
terms are enemies by definition, obliged to fight their vicious lack
of common meaning so that one of the two wins the battle and its
meaning beats the other.

This war talk, a means of semantic substitution, uses war as a means
of gaining peace, so-called humanitarian, clean, preventive wars and
ecological bombs level countries in an act of "infinite justice"...
War talk, mercenary adjectives gaining added meaning by destroying the
meaning of the neighbour. The absence of meaning is so evident that
the human mind selects one of the two terms. Which one? adjectives
spreading ideas such as "preventive", "ecological", "just", etc.
Whilst we still hear echoes of the second term, there was mention of
war, it does not hit directly, because he meaning of "war" when
connected to that of the adjectives which we prefer to hear, is not
acceptable. It would be like spines pricking in the mindbrain.

The word "war" is so complete that it is difficult to cross it quickly
out, the word bears truth, and acts as a substantial reference point
in a real world, and yet, the real winner is the lie borne by the
adjective. Who wouldn't prefer this type of war, without deaths,
clean, precise, rapid.. rather than a brute war, simple and direct,
with its unavoidable cargo of corpses?

These adjectives appear to create absent absence of meaning, and yet
they are actually playing a dirty verbal game of word seduction: war
seems less warlike with them by its side, substance is lost between
the adjectives. If we observe how these pairs are repeated
consistently and who repeats them, we forget what they really mean.

Stereotypes are what they are! We should all tremble in their
presence.

Seduction avoids conviction. Seduction sets traps. We do not hear the
expressions pronounced and yet, we find it easy to repeat them.
Somebody repeats them over and over again until we no longer see the
terms. Simply, because it doesn't exist. Just, surgical, ecological,
humanitarian, preventive and other such wars do not exist, No. But the
virus of absence of meaning has been inoculated. The "common place" is
created in this way. It is out there. They hide the reality. These
pairs have a function.

Stereotypes! The scars of languages. Language can relate truth, lies,
stereotypes, clich=E9s, etc; language can seduce and vanquish without
needing to convince. Behind language can be found major lies, but this
is not important, the aim of stereotypes is to hide the truth.
Sometimes this requires the use of the truth, an alternative truth as
compared with the one which must remain hidden.

The language of men at war, full of clich=E9s and propagandistic
slogans. The owner forces words to take mercenary form. Hitler weaved
unnatural connections such as "Jewish worm" until the Germans didn't
notice the double meaning. By setting up the existence of such
abhorrent identities, the Nazis managed to become dangerous enemies of
part of the German population representing less than 1% in 1933.
Fascism loves stereotypes. They hide the reality and seduce with lies.

Who can deny the attraction of these two words? wondered Pedro Salinas
referring to the expression "new order" regularly used by Hitler. Two
attractive words working towards the most sinister of causes. The same
power of seduction of these words is based on new stereotypes. We now
understand that the latent lack of meaning in these expressions was
war propaganda working to create stereotypes. We are not supposed to
see ourselves in these stereotypes, we are supposed to turn our view
towards another point, a point from which we cannot see the reality.

Our desire for the war to be really preventive is so strong that, if
they offer us the possibility to achieve this, they will have our
co-operation. The desire is the basis for seduction via stereotyping.
Nobody who organises a war wishes to avoid it, the person preparing a
war is looking for our approval and somehow tries to include our
desire for peace when referring to war. This leads to linguistic
aberrations which turn into propaganda and slogans. Language works in
its own way and cannot reconcile two irreconcilable terms, and we
choose to retain one of the two. Just what cannot exist. No speaker of
language, according to Cort=E1zar (1984), should pronounce them:

I call for freedom and democracy, and yet, I have pronounced these
words without asking myself what is the real meaning of these words,
their real impact, and I realise that many of those hearing my words
understand them in a way which is scaringly close to a stereotype or a
clich=E9 on which everyone agrees, such is the nature of clich=E9s and
stereotypes. Replace a home life experience with a commonplace name,
reflection with conviction and a live bird with an opaque stone.

The opaque stone of sarcasm.

Words have to be useful, but they remain captive, they contain power
like a bird caged in absence of meaning, stereotypes and sarcasm.
Giving meaning to words implies a journey into the context in which
these unnatural allies were created. Finding, in the light of the
facts referred to, what exists under the perverse signification pushed
onto these terms.

Accepting a false expression as truth is ironic, but we all know that
"lasting freedom" and "infinite justice" are means of referring to
something very serious: the actual number of Afghans having died is
still kept secret by the U.S.

We are also aware that clean or surgical wars do not exist, but these
words were used with the attacks against Iraq in 1991, where the only
dirt in sight was an oil covered bird. We took years before realising
that even the photo of this bird was a set up, before seeing the
dantesque pictures of the horrors of this "clean" war. Lynching Iraq
was not complete and a second war is required with the adjective
"preventive", i.e. a war begun by one nation against another nation
who is allegedly preparing to attack the former. And yet the adjective
appears equally sarcastic if we note that it was used by the Americans
when Iraq was already being secretly bombed by the U.S.

"Humanitarian aid" might not appear so redundant if it wasn't for the
"aid" provided by NATO for Albania/Kosovo Albanians to avoid
repression by Belgrade turning into massive indiscriminate bombarding
on Yugoslavia. The aim of humanitarian intervention is to support the
victims of tyranny, not to create more victims. Using "humanitarians"
to kill is the most underhanded, clinical and sarcastic action
possible.

To begin with, there is no doubt over the type of literary figure
referred to by these adjectives: This is not irony, but sarcasm.
"Heartrending satire of the flesh" is the etymological meaning. This
shows the certitude felt by the Greeks in the power, be it beneficial
or destructive, of words. To represent pain via language they invented
terms such as "sarcasm", a variation on irony when more vicious, cruel
and hurtful.

This is what happens when we allow this type of language, accepting
the semantically unacceptable.

The live bird

There is no better means of revealing words with opposite meaning than
to leave words in the brute format. The more cruel the reality, the
harder the attempt to hide it. Those who start wars, those who can
avoid it disguise it; they realise the danger of brute references.
They are aware, as we are aware, that words are source of vision.
Those who refer to the truth of war could scare us more than we are
capable of bearing. This would immediately cause the contrary
reaction. This is a way of gaining time. War talk is the preceding
herald. War talk brings the war, War in the language, the first
victim, the truth, the death of meaning.

The bird is born again, will live again if we travel back to the
origins of words, their brute meaning, towards solitude. No to war,
simply, without any mercenary adjectives.

One word - according to T. Tzara- is enough.

Fort! Da! is a search poem game. The user types words or phrases into the form provided, and Fort! Da! searches its internal collection of texts for a match. It then returns a phrase from the text collection in the blue output pane. This can be repeated indefinitely, creating many poems from slivers of the text set.


 The text set consists of three categories: hypertext and network criticism, erotic stories, and religious texts. The category the user queries depends on the time of day: in the morning, network criticism; in the afternoon, erotic stories; in the evening, religious texts.

After all, it's not about murdering Iraqis, it's about aesthetics.

Benign Virus Appears to Block Bush Strategy

Few White House interns or trainees seemed to have any interest
in editing out clichés or overused visual effects. In fact, very few of them
even came to work wearing a decent suit, or seeming to care
about what happened next. In the screening room, right-wing oil barons

awaited test cores shipped down from Mars and the start of yet another movie
based on superhero comics. "These bad guys are *bad*," mused one, as the action
got under way. A news team with meat on its bones waited in the corridor–
yes, one of those corridors of power we've heard so much about–

for them to emerge. "What did you think?" asked one, thrusting a mike
toward one of the suits stepping out. "Did it make you feel deeply about
anything at all? Did it make you think?" One said, "That sadist
in the mask–he was way cool." "Evil," said another, "went down

to its traditional defeat." In a conference room down the hall,
the trainees twirled their mustachios as they sought new ways to break
up the logjam of judicial appointments that caused their president
so much grief. "Ben Affleck," one sniffled, "would know what to do."

changes were made for bunny boy, and all the tender ilk. these changes
sample easy reference along the margin of the stream. there is memory in
that effect, said bunny boy, and I tend to ignite a patter congesting in
their terms. water removes itself to logical territory (a terrible place)
and witnessing eyes take account. the action adds up to a career turn, a
look of wonder at the aptly phrased pierce. it is, the announcer said, time
to blow our minds. so that windy rush cruised captivation, new sentences
piling up. the colours were yesterday and well-documented. everyone says
they understand. listen on that perch you have, said bunny boy, while the 'I
know' that you called out echoes. the sound is as vast as a terrific
explanation, and points to how creative mass can become. bunny boy moans in
slogging deference, to become instructed while one waits. poetry of this
imagination grows kinship. bunny boy is the name, elongated to take more
time. after sense program, and the arriving years, this name holds up well
enough. we can all be that name.

An Explanation of One of the Key Elements (Hint: Read
Psi-k'o-lodge-i-kali...):

Carbon has four electrons in its valence shell (outershell). Since this
energy shell can hold eight electrons, each carbon atom can share electrons
with up to four different atoms. Carbon can combine with other elements as
well as with itself. This allows carbon to form many different compounds of
varying size and shape.

Carbon alone forms the familiar substances graphite and diamond. Both are
made only of carbon atoms. Graphite is very soft and slippery. Diamond is
the hardest substance known to man. If both are made only of carbon what
gives them different properties? The answer lies in the way the carbon atoms
form bonds with each other.

tangential (tan-JEN-shuhl) adjective

   1. Only slightly relevant to the matter in hand; digressive; divergent.

   2. Merely touching.

   3. Mathematics: Of or pertaining to the nature of a tangent.

[From Latin tangent-, tangens, present participle of tangere (to touch).]

The word tangential has numerous cousins, words derived from the same root:
tax, contact, attain, intact, tact, taste, tangible, tactile. What an
unlikely bunch of words to come out of the same parent! What's common in
all is the idea of touching (or not, as in case of "intact").

Hi,

I am part of a group who is interested in creating collaborative language
works/experiments.

I am sure we will make up our own experiments as we go along, but I wanted
to ask if anyone here on the list had any suggestions of procedures for this
sort of endeavor.

Thanks,

I'm just starting to get to the boxes of literary stuff that we've
had in storage for the 3 years since moving to Fort Worth and today
opened a box with the above Vorts and one of Fielding Dawson paired
Jonathan Williams. I can't remember the rest right now. Berrigan was
paired with somebody, I'm pretty sure. I have a complete run, though
they're not all in the same box (which had runs of Temblor, This, and
some other things near the end of the alphabet).

We'll be culling through these as I've been doing with the new music
recordings and publications that I've had on ebay. As with the music
stuff, eventually we'll be auctioning off most of the poetry/literary
things that we haven't missed while it's been packed away.

Shelley thought that the air balloon was a revolutionary invention -- he
even sent leaflets aloft in balloons -- and he was a vegetarian for reasons
that resonate today (the excessive amount of grain that goes to feed cattle
undernourishes the world) plus he was an atheist.  And what terrific
poems!  However, the "unacknowledged legislators" phrase is often
misunderstood, making it sound like he advocated a secret congress of
poets.  There are other views -- and there are reasons why romanticism has
its limits -- so the poet as careful empiricist has its merits too.  Still,
poet as visionary remains powerful.

Whatever happened to Barry Alpert? He was very present in the San Francisco
Bay Area circa 1976 - 78 - maybe longer. He photographed everybody 'on the
scene' - including all of us who read at the Intersection and the Grand
Piano, and go knows how many other readings around the bay. He was always
there.
Did he place his archive of photographs somewhere? I never saw the
photographs developed, but I imagine it a good resource for critics and
chroniclers interested in flesh and public demeanor!

The other question is whether or not the interviews are actually interesting
- as much as one, given the cast of characters, would want them to be. I let
my series go years ago out of disinterest, I recall. I might of lacked the
intellectual will, but somehow I never found that the interviews spurred
much that was revelatory, stimulating etc.. Which is to ask, was Alpert a
particularly good interviewer?? And did the interviewees have trouble taking
him seriously and were somewhat passive in their responses? (That opinion
might change now if I reread them) I am sure Ron S will have an opinion and
undoubtedly high up one of his shelves has the set(?).

Women poets and poets of color apparently did not catch his magnet.

Try the old Exquisite Corpse.  An interesting variation is to agree upon line
length or meter or certain rules of syntactical structure.
       Then there is the Bernstein/Ashbery faux translation--a variant I've
used is to take the same foreign language poem and have a small group
translate it together strictly by its phonemic qualities as heard by English
speakers.
       Another is the Japanese Renga-linking poem, which has a defined set of
rules, yet enables each poet to write her own verse and pass it on to the
next.  It can go on through the mail for years!
       Lyn Hejinian and Jack Collom have long worked collaboratively, so they
would be good to ask.  Also Lyn has worked with Leslie Scalapino, in a
slightly different mode.

a quite song with a summery

there is a grind, a scream, a moan, a death rattle, a chair dragged
across the floor, a body shoved into a ditch, the crackle of burning
flesh, the whine of a television coming on (continuously coming on all
the time, everywhere, never stopping . . . .).

could be the quack of a duck, a gaggle of geese with one speaker, a
dentist drill, a cheap printer, a car starting its engine, a thousand
cars starting their engines, a million cars, a million trucks, a
billion motorcycles, a thousand planes, jets and missiles going off,
crash landing, colliding, screeching to a halt, all at the same time.

the sizzle of water next to a plutonium rod just as the backup cooling
system fails, the last sound a hermit crab makes as it suffocates in a
body coated in crude oil, a stomach on salmonella, the howl of
kreutzfeld-jacob disease, HIV victims fear amplified, a heart attack, a
birth pain, the lid of a casket closing, the Wichita Vortex Sutra sung
by allen ginsberg, a monks chant, the mind deteriorating in an
Alzheimer's state, slim pickens hoot riding an atom bomb to oblivion, a
burning cigarette in the swindle of silence.

On the edge in Texas. I thought wrapping the Viet Nam Memorial was over the
top - even as a war protest. But an Art Gallery  - replete with plans to
show Andy Warhol's images of Jacqueline K - on the site where Oswald put
down his chicken drumstick, raised his rifle and took out the President,
well, at least or at best, that should make the eye and senses much more
keen!

Issue #9 came out in 1976, was Guy Davenport, but I can't remember who
the companion was - could it have been Paul Metcalf?. It was the final
issue.

Originally Alpert intended to reprint copies on demand - but that (for
understandable reasons) didn't work out.

And yeah, all white and male and, er, but for Hollo native
English-speakers.

Question is . . . Were there more than 8 issues?  Looks like he was
going for a "round" nine.

2002) is a major publication in American poetry. . . . "not so much a
book as it is a tremendous force field in which world and perception
collaborate in the construction of innovative formal 'architextures'
for a sensual language that has no like" (Forrest Gander).  As poet,
translator (Neruda, Segalen, et al), critic, editor, and
anthropologist, Mr. Tarn has published some 35 books in various
disciplines.  He lives in the desert 20 minutes northwest of Santa
=46e, New Mexico.

        "Isn't it the end now, isn't it the way you come home as if
you were not coming, as if you were staying down and were going to
eat of that food for all time, what is it, the amaranth seeds, or
poppy seeds, or the marigold seeds, something intolerably like that,
and would be satisfied to stay down there forever, without anything
to say to yourself in this new tongue, this novel we are trying to
talk up here, or to say to yourself, to tell us in unwearying detail,
what it is that our time needs to know that is so close now to
finishing without ever having had its say? . . . "

        --Nathaniel Tarn, from Arc 1: 88, the architextures, Selected Poems

*  CHRIS DANIELS has lately translated into American English a great
deal of poetry by celebrated Portuguese 'heteronymist' Fernando
Pessoa (a large selection of that work, and a great interview with
Daniels and co-translator Dana Stevens, is in Crayon 3), and by
exceptional Brazilian poets Murilo Mendes, Orides Fontela, and Josely
Vianna Baptista, among others.  Ms. Baptista's amazing On the Shining
Screen of the Eyelids, with artwroks by Francisco Faria, is due from
Manifest Press, while Chaos's Window, a volume of selected poems of
Mendes, is forthcoming from Rumor Books.  He lives in Berkeley.

        ". . . Well, you have to be a plodding, careful, stubborn
daredevil, and you have to love your language, and the language
you're translating, so much that you're willing to be almost
violently free with both of them.  And I don't think I could
translate anything that didn't excite me. . . . I'm not going to
gussy up the poems, or 'make sense of' the syntax just so some
jumped-up prick in a creative writing program somewhere, or some
editor, or critic, or anyone else can say 'Hey, this is poetry!'"

        --Chris Daniels, "Nothing But A Name: a conversation between
Chris Chen, Chris Daniels, and Dana Stevens" in Crayon 3

        "Lightly, lightly, very lightly,
        A wind passes very lightly
        And goes away, always very lightly.
         And I don't know what I think
         And I don't want to know."

        --Alberto Caeiro/Fernando Pessoa, tr. Chris Daniels & Dana Stevens

someone sent the list a piece from "urban legends" on
the translation of "Coca Cola" into chinese; I wanted
to note that this evidently dates from the 1950s
(based on population figures for Hong Kong, Taiwan,
and the statement that the mainland was off limits for
Coca Cola) but the translation into "Delicious and
Delightful" which is what Kekou Kele means, or else
"edible and pleasing" might be an alternate, dates
from the 1920s.  because globalization has gone on
forever.
I realize this comment is far removed from concerns
either of the impending conflict or the proper
relationship between older and younger poets, but this
is nevertheless what I want to say, to the list, at
this moment.

Lawyer Arrested for Wearing a 'Peace' T - Shirt
By REUTERS

Filed at 7:56 p.m. ET
NEW YORK (Reuters) - A lawyer was arrested late Monday and charged with
trespassing at a public mall in the state of New York after refusing to
take off a T-shirt advocating peace that he had just purchased at the mall.
According to the criminal complaint filed on Monday, Stephen Downs was
wearing a T-shirt bearing the words ``Give Peace A Chance'' that he had
just purchased from a vendor inside the Crossgates Mall in Guilderland, New
York, near Albany.
``I was in the food court with my son when I was confronted by two security
guards and ordered to either take off the T-shirt or leave the mall,'' said
Downs.
When Downs refused the security officers' orders, police from the town of
Guilderland were called and he was arrested and taken away in handcuffs,
charged with trespassing ``in that he knowingly enter(ed) or remain(ed)
unlawfully upon premises,'' the complaint read.
Downs said police tried to convince him he was wrong in his actions by
refusing to remove the T-shirt because the mall ``was like a private house
and that I was acting poorly.
``I told them the analogy was not good and I was then hauled off to night
court where I was arraigned after pleading not guilty and released on my
own recognizance,'' Downs told Reuters in a telephone interview.
Downs is the director of the Albany Office of the state Commission on
Judicial Conduct, which investigates complaints of misconduct against
judges and can admonish, censure or remove judges found to have engaged in
misconduct.
Calls to the Guilderland police and district attorney, Anthony Cardona and
to officials at the mall were not returned for comment.
Downs is due back in court for a hearing on March 17.
He could face up to a year in prison if convicted.

first you interpret, then it is erected

module1:

this character is the flute-playing girl, cloud..
did you once hear master say, "cloud, how are things in the sky?"
a cloud is naked under her silk..

cloud sits playing her flute by the nine buddhas fountain.

nine buddhas fountain comprises one acre of area.
nine buddhas fountain has nine tiers of water
all nine buddhas of the fountain are black carboniferous stone
each in situ w/ in situ diamond bindu
their tears are flowing
from tears to tiers
the nine buddhas are weeping
the fountain of weeping is flowing
this flow of suffering is our world

cloud sits playing her flute by the nine buddhas fountain

the approach:

the approach to nine buddhas fountain is through the perilous garden of
flame.
this is the garden of war. fire generals, fire demons, fire maidens, fire
poets,
fire engines, fire trees, fire bulls, fire monkeys, fire snakes, fire
warriors, fire
analysts, fire walkers, fire dreamers, fire flowers, fire butterflies, fire
ivy.
They all grow and thrive in this wicked maelstrom.

to hear cloud play her flute, you must pass through the garden of fire.
you are called _lump of coal_, and to pass through the garden you must burn
yourself up, you must be crushed beneath them all, as in a dream.
you must awaken in situ, a diamond, at the fountain of the nine buddhas

there you will see cloud playing her flute
naked under the silk

hey kom...
were you looking at the piece in the evening?
i've noticed that behavior in the evening
sequences...which draw from religious texts...at first
i thought, man, i gotta fix this, but then, as it
seems to occur only with the religious section, i
decided mayve it was best to leave it as it is...
as for loading...it's about 387K, which is KINDA
heavy...and strangely enough, i do believe it's all
the text that's making it so heavy...perhaps a
preloader....

yes they were religious, the snippets i got, and it was evening, and well,
the loading i think has to do with the code rather than the file size, but
i'm not a programmer so it is just a guess, from past experience.

{    Lawyer Arrested for Wearing a 'Peace' T - Shirt
{    By REUTERS
{
{    Filed at 7:56 p.m. ET
{    NEW YORK (Reuters) - A lawyer was arrested late Monday and charged with
{    trespassing at a public mall in the state of New York after refusing to
{    take off a T-shirt advocating peace that he had just purchased at the mall.
{    According to the criminal complaint filed on Monday, Stephen Downs was
{    wearing a T-shirt bearing the words ``Give Peace A Chance'' that he had
{    just purchased from a vendor inside the Crossgates Mall in Guilderland, New
{    York, near Albany.
{    ``I was in the food court with my son when I was confronted by two security
{    guards and ordered to either take off the T-shirt or leave the mall,'' said
{    Downs.
{    When Downs refused the security officers' orders, police from the town of
{    Guilderland were called and he was arrested and taken away in handcuffs,
{    charged with trespassing ``in that he knowingly enter(ed) or remain(ed)
{    unlawfully upon premises,'' the complaint read.
{    Downs said police tried to convince him he was wrong in his actions by
{    refusing to remove the T-shirt because the mall ``was like a private house
{    and that I was acting poorly.
{    ``I told them the analogy was not good and I was then hauled off to night
{    court where I was arraigned after pleading not guilty and released on my
{    own recognizance,'' Downs told Reuters in a telephone interview.
{    Downs is the director of the Albany Office of the state Commission on
{    Judicial Conduct, which investigates complaints of misconduct against
{    judges and can admonish, censure or remove judges found to have engaged in
{    misconduct.
{    Calls to the Guilderland police and district attorney, Anthony Cardona and
{    to officials at the mall were not returned for comment.
{    Downs is due back in court for a hearing on March 17.
{    He could face up to a year in prison if convicted.

more language and the who cares effort, which is strict and tender, like so
many of us. ardent could be prop, just as so much saying. terribly boring
tho the team may be, extracting useful information to pore over, just in
time but not too much. the first clue will be there in the sentence
structure. it's about how small the whining sound can make. it's a pure
falsetto, perhaps, or metallic screech, or anyway, it scars the air with
this thing, we are weird. when we box in the divot that was could and/or
trained, the elements fly apart. this is veritable saying, such as the
experts have to see. and lonesome extremes poise over the dollar sign, the
still reward, the next great paragraph and writ large for evidence. and
still more language, jutting into conversation, tapping the crowd for
another nod or wink: look how I make bunnies! cries bunny maker indeed.
speeches are given time, allowed to rest at the riverside. these speeches
will be placed as vocal dowry, say, or some luck found. the achievement will
be to render the logic as preamble to the next big thing to turn around the
sun. good luck to the motion, bad cess to the critical units left behind.
the bunnies are at work.

yeah, i noted that the religious texts are for some
odd reason that i suspect has to do with formatting
harder to search than the others...a problem i should
fix, but there's something nice about it...

& yes, the loading time IS the code...all the source
texts are embedded in the code, in three arrays...so
while the media elements aren't heavy, the text is (i

{    {    NEW YORK (Reuters) - A lawyer was arrested late Monday and charged with
{    {    trespassing at a public mall in the state of New York after refusing to
{    {    take off a T-shirt advocating peace that he had just purchased at the mall.
{    {    According to the criminal complaint filed on Monday, Stephen Downs was
{    {    wearing a T-shirt bearing the words ``Give Peace A Chance'' that he had
{    {    just purchased from a vendor inside the Crossgates Mall in Guilderland, New
{    {    York, near Albany.
{    {    ``I was in the food court with my son when I was confronted by two security
{    {    guards and ordered to either take off the T-shirt or leave the mall,'' said
{    {    Downs.
{    {    When Downs refused the security officers' orders, police from the town of
{    {    Guilderland were called and he was arrested and taken away in handcuffs,
{    {    charged with trespassing ``in that he knowingly enter(ed) or remain(ed)
{    {    unlawfully upon premises,'' the complaint read.
{    {    Downs said police tried to convince him he was wrong in his actions by
{    {    refusing to remove the T-shirt because the mall ``was like a private house
{    {    and that I was acting poorly.
{    {    ``I told them the analogy was not good and I was then hauled off to night
{    {    court where I was arraigned after pleading not guilty and released on my
{    {    own recognizance,'' Downs told Reuters in a telephone interview.
{    {    Downs is the director of the Albany Office of the state Commission on
{    {    Judicial Conduct, which investigates complaints of misconduct against
{    {    judges and can admonish, censure or remove judges found to have engaged in
{    {    misconduct.
{    {    Calls to the Guilderland police and district attorney, Anthony Cardona and
{    {    to officials at the mall were not returned for comment.
{    {    Downs is due back in court for a hearing on March 17.
{    {    He could face up to a year in prison if convicted.

Modernist Cultures

Modernist Studies Association Fifth Annual Conference
Birmingham, UK
25th-28th September 2003

Founded in 1999, the Modernist Studies Association is devoted to the study
of the arts in their social, political, cultural, and intellectual contexts
from the late nineteenth through the mid-twentieth century. Through its
annual conferences and journal, Modernism/Modernity, the organization seeks
to develop an international and interdisciplinary forum for exchange among
scholars in this revitalized and rapidly expanding field.

The fifth annual Modernist Studies Association Conference is the first to
be held in Europe. Hosted by the University of Birmingham and the
University of Sussex, it will take place in the heart of the multicultural
city of Birmingham, a world-renowned conference centre and the UK's second
city, where Victorian architecture mingles with exciting and innovative
redevelopment. The programme will include plenaries, panels, peer seminars,
prose and poetry readings, along with film screenings and book and art
exhibits specifically related to the international and interdisciplinary
study of modernist cultures.

Conference Coordinators:
Andrzej Gasiorek and Deborah Parsons (University of Birmingham)
Laura Marcus and Peter Nicholls (University of Sussex)

Conference Administrator: Samantha Skinner, Department of English,
University of Birmingham, Edgbaston, Birmingham B15 2TT, UK.

Calls for panel and individual paper proposals follow. Please note
that MSA rules do not allow participants to lead a seminar and present
a paper for a panel at the same conference, though participants may present
a panel paper and participate in a seminar, or chair a panel and lead a
seminar. (The seminar roster is currently being finalized. If you=20
have proposed a seminar and have questions at this time, please=20
address them to Doug Mao, dm253@cornell.edu.)

All who attend the MSA Conference must be members of the organization with
dues paid for 2003.





CALL FOR PANEL PROPOSALS
Deadline: 4 April 2003

How do I propose a Panel?

Proposals for panels must include the following information.  Please assist
us by sending this information in exactly the order given here.  Use as a

MSA policy on panels:

participant may both present a paper and lead one of the conference's semin=
ars.
2. We encourage interdisciplinary panels, and strongly discourage panels on
single authors.
3. We encourage panels with three participants.  Panels of four and
roundtables of five or six will be considered.
4.  Panels composed entirely of participants from a single department at a
single institution are not likely to be accepted.

attempt to locate a moderator, but if you do not have one, we will locate
one for you.

April, 2003.  Early submission is strongly encouraged.



Individual Paper Proposals

In addition to pre-arranged panels, a limited number of individual papers
may be accepted for the program of MSA 5.  Please send your name, paper

     Stop That Train!

   by Adele Oliveri; March 02, 2003

From zmag.org ZNet | Anti War

   Italy is already at war. Nobody would have noticed, had it not been for a
handful of trains carrying US military equipment from the military base of
Ederle (north-eastern Italy) to Camp Darby (Tuscany); and had it not been,
of
course, for the mobilizations of a few hundreds of Italian activists who
over
the past few days have been chasing those trains all along their route, to
stop
or at least delay their journey, in an attempt to enforce "an embargo
against
American weapons that will kill civilians in Iraq".

   This week's protests, following in the wake of the successful
demonstrations
of February 15, are contributing to the strengthening of the Italian
anti-war
front, as the presence on the Italian territory of these "trains of death"
rekindles the debate over Italy's logistic role in supporting an attack on
Iraq.

   Due to its geographic location, since the end of World War 2 Italy has
been
a key strategic location for the establishment of US and NATO military
bases,
initially to contain the threats posed by the then Soviet Union. There are
currently 6 major US bases and 4 major NATO bases located across the
country,
plus countless military installation, employing about 13 thousand military
and
15 thousand civilian personnel.

   Camp Darby, near Pisa, Tuscany, widely considered the largest US arsenal
abroad, allegedly hosts 20 thousands tons of artillery ammunitions,
missiles,
bombs and over 8 thousand tons of high explosives; due to its proximity to
the
port of Livorno, one of the two largest in Italy together with Genova, Camp
Darby is also one of 6 US bases worldwide used for mobilizing troops and
equipment. And Livorno is precisely the final destination of the train's
military cargo; from there, it will be shipped to Turkey and to the Iraq war
front.

   Since the inception of the Iraqi crisis, the US Administration has been
pressing the Italian government to grant access to the country's airspace,
bases
and transport infrastructure, to facilitate the deployment of troops and
equipment towards the Middle East.

   Needless to say, Berlusconi and his cabinet proved all too easy to
convince.
On February 14, the Minister of Foreign Affairs Antonio Martino, sent a
letter
to the Italian Parliament informing that he had granted all the US' request
concerning transport infrastructures, both civil and military, specifying
that
"those requests are not part of actions leading to the preparation of war
against Iraq, but of an effort to put pressure on Saddam Husseins's regime".

   Martino's letter aroused widespread indignation among the opposition and
the
anti-war movement, as it was rightly perceived as a declaration of
unilateral
support to a US military action on Iraq, regardless of any decision taken by
the
UN Security Council, without giving the Parliament the opportunity to debate
Italy's involvement in the conflict, and in stark opposition to the
widespread
public opposition to war.

   It is not surprising, therefore, that the most militant wing of the
anti-war
movement, headed by the Disobbedienti ("The Disobedients") decided to step
up
the confrontation, preparing to intervene with peaceful direct actions at
the
earliest signs of military maneuvers on the Italian territory.

   They didn't have to wait long. A week later, on Friday 21, the first two
trains (out of a planned total of 26), departing from a minor station in
North
East, were already being loaded with military vehicles and equipment,
heading
for Camp Darby. Alerted by rail workers, demonstrators made it quickly to
the
spot, holding up for a few hours one of the two trains while the second
managed
to depart. But it was not going to be an easy ride.

   Thanks to an efficient communication network, protesters, often operating
in
relatively small groups (20-30 people) set up mobile blockades all along the
route, lighting up fires and obstructing the tracks, forcing the train to
come
to a halt and to change its route several times before it reached its final
destination. Their actions didn't go unchallenged, of course, as the police
promptly stepped in to clear the route as the train advanced at a walking
pace.
The train eventually made it to Camp Darby, with several hours' delay.

   By the end of day one, it was clear that demonstrators were not going to
be
alone in their pursuit: rail workers, tacitly supported by their unions,
immediately declared the would boycott the trains' operations, refusing to
work
and providing the demonstrators with all the logistic information required
to
set up blockades (itineraries, timetables, etc.); the mayors of Pisa and
Livorno
(the two Tuscan cities near to Camp Darby) formally asked the government to
provide detailed information of the military cargo, complaining they had not
been notified that such operations were going to take place; and dockworkers
in
Livorno proclaimed their intention to strike in the event they were asked to
load military equipment.

   The workers' resistance received the full support of Sergio Cofferati,
former leader of CGIL (the largest Italian trade union) and widely regarded
as
one of the most influential figures of the Italian left, who on that same
day
issued a statement encouraging "the use of all possible democratic measures
to
contrast war".

   Cofferati's declaration was (unintentionally?) matched by a very similar
(yet profoundly different) statement by the Minister of the Interiors
Giuseppe
Pisanu who, taken aback by the strength of the protests, advocated the "use
of
all possible measures, and if necessary [...] the full restraining force of
the
state" against the demonstrators.

   Indeed, as actions intensified over the following days, so did police
repression: demonstrators were often beaten and forcibly removed from the
tracks, and in some cases identified and reported to the local police
station.
But this was not enough to deter protesters, who partially changed their
strategy switching to what they called "creative disobedience".

   Given that the trains of death were transiting on the same tracks and at
the
same time as regular trains, what easier way to block the former than by
arresting the latter? The "put a brake to war" campaign was launched:
activists
would get on board civil trains and operate the emergency brake, creating
further delays to the trains of death that were following on the same
tracks.

   (Interestingly enough, there weren't reports of any complaints by
travelers
and commuters affected by the delays, who on several occasions where seen to
be
very supportive and encouraging, cheering up the activists with rounds of
applauses.)

   Blockades, rallies, occupations and sit-ins spread like wildfire, also
thanks to alternative media such as global radio, radio sherwood and
indymedia
italy, that provided live coverage of the protests, advised demonstrators on
how
to reach the hot spots along the rail tracks, invited to report the sighting
of
trains, offered the necessary legal advice and even acted as forums for
discussing methods and forms of civil disobedience (on indymedia, a rail
worker
was explaining how to turn the semaphores red without hurting oneself).

   By Tuesday 25 February it was apparent that the blockades were being
successful in creating some serious disruptions to the military maneuvers:
the
Ministry of Interior and the Public Security Department had decided to make
trains travel at night, in an attempt to escape the blockades, while some of
the
military cargo was being deviated on the highways causing severe delays and
long
queues.

   On the same day, demonstrators also learnt that the US military were
negotiating with Slovenia the possibility of redirecting the remaining
trains
across their borders, to reach Turkey through Hungary, Romania and Bulgaria.
While initial instructions (later classified) mentioned 26 trains, only 8
had
made it to their final destination by Tuesday. And no trains were spotted on
the
following day either, as the demonstrations reached their peak with a 10,000
people march in Pisa and blockades, occupations and demonstrations all
across
the country, even in those regions where no trains of death were due to
travel.

   Are there any lessons we can learn from these events? First, there are
acts
of civil disobedience capable of bringing together a wide range of social
forces, beyond the most radical constituencies. By joining forces with rail
workers and their trade unions, not only did demonstrators get access to key
logistic information, but their actions gained a greater credibility among
the
general public, large sections of which have until recently been quite
cautious
in supporting acts of civil disobedience.

   Second, successful action does not necessarily require rigid, centralized
organizational structures. Indeed, last week's train blockades were the
outcome
of the efforts of diverse groups, mainly from social centers and militant
organizations, sharing a long history of coordinated actions while
maintaining
their own identity and organizational autonomy.

   Third, there is no point in sitting around waiting for the next big demo
to
be arranged, before we mobilize over and over again. Small local actions, if
cleverly organized, can be equally powerful and effective in showing our
determination to stop the war. It didn't take thousands to obstruct the
plans of
the American military in Italy: a handful of courageous and determined
people
was all that was needed. As the African proverb goes, "if you think you are
too
small to make a difference, try sleeping in a small room with a mosquito."

   PS - as i write, i learn that, according to the Minister of the Interior,
"the shipment of US military equipment was regularly completed" with the
arrival
of the last train in Pisa, and that "police managed to guarantee at the same
time public security and the right to demonstrate". In the meanwhile,
however,
il Manifesto (Italian left-wing daily) is reporting the sighting of at least
10
"ghost" planes, carrying military personnel and equipment, that have been
stopping over at night at the Roman civil airport of Fiumicino, directed to
Kuwait...

WILLIAM  ANASTASI
BLIND  The Dwan Gallery Camouflage Proposal, 1966 / White Box Annex
project, 2003
MARCH  8 - MARCH 29, 2003
OPENING RECEPTION SATURDAY MARCH 8, 6 - 8 pm

In November/ December, 1966, years before the term site-specific had
become a by-word, William Anastasi presented for consideration a number
of drawings and proposals for exhibitions at the Dwan Gallery, New York.
In each of these proposals the idea of the self-referential loomed
large, and the gallery space would be a relevant component of the
exhibit. One of the proposals called for the camouflaging of the
gallery's interior - walls, ceiling, lights, ashtray stands and
wall-to-wall carpeting.   At the time the idea of camouflaging the
interior of the gallery was passed over for logistical reasons. Our
elected leaders were enthusiastically building up their forces in South
Vietnam and ordering a daily rain of bombs for Hanoi in the first weeks
of December that year. Aside from the timeliness of the proposal,
Anastasi was interested in the conceptual inversion implied in
camouflaging the inside of something.  37 years later as our elected
leaders - against public opinion - again build up their forces around
Iraq, White Box is proud to give birth to this unique project.

(Volunteers needed for the completion of the camouflage Thursday and
Friday till midnight - please call White Box! 212-714-2347)

ROBERT MARINO: 1985 - PRESENT
MARCH 4 -  MARCH 15, 2003
This exhibition features original architectural drawings, models, and
furniture.

"Committed to the practice of architecture as a practical/cultural
service in an everyday sense- an article of faith that is not without
its wider political implications- Marino's work always seems to
gravitate towards the creation of form that is structurally cellular at
the level of the enveloping membrane; the moiré, the laminate, the
pleat, the egg crate and the folded plate, these are the building-blocks
out of which his surprising and exuberant inventions are invariably made."
- Kenneth Frampton

*************

from La Jornada Semanal, Sunday, March 2nd, 2003, No. 417

[intro translated by Espinoza -- not all 48 poems included]

In this issue we publish forty-eight poems written by poets who are
opposed to war. This is our way of sending our support to the american
poets who delivered their protest to the imperial mansion. We asked our
fellow poets to send a text, and everybody accepted; only two refused to
do so, one because he=92s against all that =93anti yankee demagogy=94, =
and the
other because he would only subscribe a manifesto against Saddam Hussein
(no comments). This show of solidarity is inscribed in the memory of the
fraternal union between writers. Canetti said that =93we must defend =
each
other and defend together the fundamental values of humanism, because
otherwise, we know no one would defend us.=94 All the civilized world =
has
manifested itself against the war. This issue, dedicated to protest and
to pacifist affirmation runs alongside every march taking place in every
corner of the rational world. In front of this new unlimited cruelty, we
think of the phrase of the leper in Schwob=92s The Children=92s Crusade:
Domine Infantium, libera-me.

MONDAY MARCH 10 [8:00pm]
GEOFFREY G. O'BRIEN AND SAM TRUITT
Geoffrey G. O'Brien's first book, The Guns and Flags Project, came out from
The University of California Press in 2002.

Sam Truitt is the author of Anamorphosis Eisenhower (Lost Roads Publishers,
1998), Vertical Elegies: Three Works, a series of short books with Ugly
Duckling Presse, and Vertical Elegies 5: The Section (University of Georgia
Press, 2003). Robert Creeley selected an excerpt from Raton Rex =8B one of
Three Works =8B for The Best American Poetry 2002. Sam Truitt teaches at the
Van Arsdale Center for Labor Studies and lives on Sugar Hill. Creeley
recently wrote on The Section: "Here is word from the other side of the
implacable mirror =8B as if a contemporary Everyman might still be able to
speak and ourselves be still able to hear him. This extraordinary sequence
of poems is not only fact of a brilliant poet's arrival but equally of a
determined vision of our degraded world, a last warning, so to speak, befor=
e
there's nothing left to say."

WEDNESDAY MARCH 12 [8:00pm]
MAXINE CHERNOFF AND PAUL HOOVER
Maxine Chernoff has written six books of poetry and six books of fiction.
Her most recent book of poems is World: Poems 1991-2001 from Salt Press in
Cambridge, England, and Applecross, Australia. Her most recent books of
fiction are the novel A Boy in Winter from Crown Publishing Group (1999) an=
d
Some of Her Friends That Year: New and Selected Stories from Coffee House
Press (2002). A Boy in Winter is being developed into a film for Showtime.
Her other books include The New York Times Notable Book of 1993, Signs of
Devotion (Simon and Schuster, stories) and New Faces of 1952 (Ithaca House,
1985), which won the Carl Sandburg Award. With Paul Hoover she edits the
long-running magazine New American Writing, an annual poetry journal. CLMP
awarded her and Paul Hoover the 1988 Editor's Award and the 30th anniversar=
y
of NAW (formerly Oink!) was held at the National Arts Club in 2001. Of her
poetry The New York Times Book Review applauds: "Like a superreal painter,
Ms. Chernoff treats minutiae with the importance of the important,
stylistically upgrading the trivial to the essential.  Absurdist but loving=
,
measuring words with an eyedropper but not a minimalist, Chernoff is
pyrotechnically funny."

Paul Hoover is author of nine poetry collections including Winter (Mirror),
published by Flood Editions in 2002, Rehearsal in Black (Salt Publications,
2001), Totem and Shadow: New & Selected Poems (Talisman House, 1999);
Viridian (University of Georgia Press, 1997); The Novel: A Poem (New
Directions, l990); and Idea (The Figures, l987), which won the Carl Sandbur=
g
Award given by Friends of the Chicago Public Library. His poetry has
appeared in numerous magazines including American Poetry Review, The New
Republic, The Paris Review, Sulfur, Conjunctions, Triquarterly, and Partisa=
n
Review. It has also been published in numerous anthologies and five edition=
s
of the annual anthology The Best American Poetry (Scribners). His book of
literary essays, Fables of Representation, will be published in the Poets o=
n
Poetry series of University of Michigan Press. He edited the anthology,
Postmodern American Poetry (W. W. Norton, l994). Author of a novel, Saigon,
Illinois (Vintage, l988), a chapter of which appeared in The New Yorker, he
wrote the screenplay for the independent film, Viridian, produced and
directed by Joseph Ramirez in 1994. Of Viridian Mary Jo Bang of the Boston
Review writes "There is a cool precision in these poems, a striking aptness
in the marrying of word to word. And in many of them, there is an unexpecte=
d
tenderness only half-masked by Hoover's allegiance to exploring and mapping
language's inherent imperfection. . . . Central to all of them (regardless
of language's irrefutable limitations) is his keen intelligence and laconic
wit."

FRIDAY MARCH 14 [9:30pm]

Thanks Ron for referring to this article in the Philadelphia Inquirer

I regret that none of the writers in our Notable Poets and Writers
series in general, or below, made his/her way into the article.

Subject:      Some notes on Kool School
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; format=flowed

Some notes on Kool School, like "Dogme 95":

1) No author photos, no blurbs, no introductions, no afterwards, no awards,
no dedications, no epigrams.  Bios no more than three sentences, 50 words,
on the inside.  Only one book, one mag mentioned.  No acknowledgements with
the titles of poems listed.  No awards, no fellowships, no schools
mentioned. No geographical information.  Maybe an e-mail address in bio.  No
personal information (kids, wives, husbands, dogs, cats, etc.)
2) Maybe a poem on the back of a book.  Maybe an extension of the cover art.
  Maybe nothing.
3) Cover art from an artist friend, maybe an original. No famous pieces.  If
you don't have any artist friends you should fucking get some.
4) No readings longer than 20-25 minutes.
5) No extensive podium shtick or stand-up. No planned or canned humor.  No
explaining poems.  No dedications at the mike. No, "for those of you who
don't know what a sonnet is." No, "I wrote this after reading a poem by
(awe-inducing fame engine)." No, "I'm gonna read from my new manuscript,
entitled (clever title)."
6) No inside jokes.  No kissing up.  No name-dropping.  No glad-handing.
7) Sometimes attend readings for people you hate or are supposed to hate.
8) Start a magazine.  If you have one, start another.  Or publish someone's
book (not a friend's, or not a good friend's)
9) Open a blog. But no solid-forever links.  Link when there's something to
link to.  Mention something when it hits you.
10) Sleep with me.

I Reply:

1) I always stand up at the podium. I'm too short when I sit.
2) All my manuscripts have clever titles. But I'll work on it.

I'll let Werner H. know about this..
We're hunting "Electric Eels" on the Danube this weekend, again,
in rented bath-tubs! A. Jodorowsky usually stops by the
cuckoo-clock shoppe afterwords
to show us his latest Graphic Novel.. I think "White Lama"
was my favorite so far.. I'll let him know too, though I don't think
he'll be so impressed, after hanging out with Moebius an all...

Come on Jim, you can do better than that:

1) No *covers.*  No staples.  No mechanical type.  Poems should be written by hand in dog blood on stiff slabs of pale moldy cheese held together with rusty nails.

2) The author's name should never even be *mentioned*.

3) Readings should be phoned in, or taped.  No inflections of any kind.  No pauses between poems.

4) No more magazines.  Just graffiti other people's poems onto public buildings with spray paint or etch them on the back of bus seats with penknives.

5) No more blogs.  No more e-lists. No more computers.  Just drive around your neighborhood ranting though a megaphone.

6) Sleep with the next poet you meet.  Then chew off their head.  GRRAARRRGHGHHHH!!!!!!!!!

Howdy all -- thought I'd pass along this good bit of news in a sea of bad.
This is actually a pretty damn important victory.  Estrada was on Bush's fast
track to the Supreme Court.  No longer.  The democrats finally showed a little
courage here.  Keep on pushin.   -m.

********************
Filibuster Sustained!
Democrats Hold the Line
Senators Affirm Constitutional Advice and Consent Duty, Hold Firm Against
Stealth Nominee Estrada in Face of Republican Intimidation Tactics
Refusing to cave in to intense pressure from the White House and Republican
leaders, Democratic senators rejected an effort to force a vote on the
nomination of Miguel Estrada to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit.
Estrada has refused to answer many questions about his approach to the
Constitution and the White House has refused to release documents that would
allow senators to more fully evaluate his fitness for a federal judgeship.
People For the American Way President Ralph G. Neas called the vote a victory
for the Constitution and the American people, and a rebuff to the Bush
administration’s efforts to pack the federal appeals courts with right-wing
ideologues and frustrate the Senate’s advise and consent role. Neas said there
would be many more tests of senators’ resolve in the coming weeks and months,
as long as the Bush administration refuses to engage in bipartisan consultation
and compromise on judicial nominations.
Neas’ statement follows:


This vote was tremendously important for the future of the federal judiciary
and for the rights and freedoms Americans count on the courts to protect. It is
a major loss for the Bush administration and its political allies, who have
tried to bully senators into submission with outrageous threats and
accusations.
We salute the courageous leadership of Senators Tom Daschle, Harry Reid,
Judiciary Committee Ranking Member Pat Leahy, his committee colleagues Charles
Schumer, Ted Kennedy, and Richard Durbin, and all the other senators who stood
up to the intimidation tactics employed by the Bush White House and Senate
Republican leaders. Especially disturbing were the repugnant efforts of a
number of Republicans to characterize opponents of Mr. Estrada’s confirmation
as anti-Hispanic.
We also applaud the several hundred thousand Americans, including 40,000
supporters of People For the American Way, who contacted senators and recorded
their opposition to Mr. Estrada’s confirmation.
People For the American Way hopes that selected filibusters, public pressure,
and other measures will lead to true bipartisan consultation, negotiation, and
compromise on judicial nominations. Only a bipartisan solution fully supported
by President Bush can solve a problem created by the unprecedented ideological
blockade against Clinton administration Circuit Court nominees by the Senate
Republican leadership from 1995 to 2000 (35 percent of those nominees were
blocked) and by President Bush’s efforts to fill those judicial vacancies with
judges in the mold of Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas.
The effort by Republican leaders to invoke “cloture” failed to receive the 60
votes required to cut off debate and force a final vote on the nomination. It
came in the midst of an intense lobbying and public relations campaign by the
White House, Senate Republicans, and their political allies, a campaign marked
by accusations that opposition to Estrada’s confirmation was grounded in
anti-Hispanic bigotry.
Neas noted that a significant majority of Hispanic legal, civil rights, and
worker rights organizations, as well as a huge and diverse coalition of civil
rights, women’s rights, labor, environmental protection and other groups, are
opposed to Estrada’s confirmation because they are concerned that as a federal
judge he would work to restrict protection of individuals’ rights.

A Villanelle Returns From War


You have to make sense now.
Planes are in the air.
You have to speak up

before planes.  You've bought all
there will be to buy.  Say something
plain, make bye-bye. Tell everyone

you need this and this.  What?
No flower in the kit?
In the kitchen panes warm up,

whistle. See why there is no steam:
It's all fire and sand.  It's pain
less flour, salt, and petals. Yell,

whistle, say some lower the living,
raise the dead, craft the air.  Oh, and
bring people, take people.  Ports

are drawers of the sea,
tables of land.  Sit down, be sensible,
say something before you take off again.

White House insists satirist remove image lampooning Lynne Cheney from
Web site

LARRY NEUMEISTER, Associated Press Writer Thursday, March 6, 2003

(03-06) 04:11 PST NEW YORK (AP) --

An Internet lampoon of Vice President Dick Cheney's wife is no laughing
matter at the White House, which has asked a satirist to remove
pictures of her -- complete with red clown noses -- from his Web site.

But the New York Civil Liberties Union struck back Wednesday on behalf
of John A. Wooden, 31, threatening a lawsuit to protect his First
Amendment rights to parody the White House and Bush officials on his
site, whitehouse.org.

The official White House site is whitehouse.gov.

Cheney counsel David S. Addington warned Wooden's Chickenhead
Productions Inc. that Lynne V. Cheney's name and pictures -- altered to
show her with a red clown's nose and a missing tooth -- could not be
used to make money without her consent, and asked Wooden to delete the
photos and "fictitious biographical statement about her."

Instead, Wooden cautioned Web site visitors that the vice president
"wishes you to be aware ... that some/all of the biographic information
contained on this PARODY page about Mrs. Cheney may not actually be
true."

And, it added, the editors of the Web site were "confident that any
rumors about Mrs. Cheney formerly being a crystal meth pusher are 100
percent likely to be absolutely untrue. Similarly, any stories about
her penchant for licking brandy Alexanders off the hirsute belly of her
spouse are all lies, lies, lies!"

NYCLU lawyer Chris Dunn wrote the office of the vice president that the
material was "fully protected by the First Amendment."

"With everything happening in the world, you'd think the office of the
vice president would have something more important to do than sending
letters to political satirists," Wooden said.

A spokeswoman for Cheney's office, Jennifer Millerwise, confirmed the
letter from Addington was authentic but said she otherwise had no
comment.

'Craie-oleaginous?

'Ever wonder where Crayola crayons got that name?
Edwin Binney's wife, Alice, a school teacher, came up
with it.  She combined the word craie, French for
chalk, with the first part of oleaginous, for the oily
paraffin wax used, to make the name Crayola! . . .

'1958: "Prussian blue" is renamed "midnight blue" in
response to teachers' observations that students are
no longer familiar with Prussian history. . . .

'1962: The Crayola Crayon color, "flesh," changes to
"peach," recognizing that not everyone's skin is the
same shade. . . .

'Renowned American artist Grant Wood entered a Crayola
coloring contest in the early 1900s and won.  Wood
later commented that winning the contest gave him the
encouragement he needed to pursue a career in art. . .
.

'1996:  Ninety-three years after the making of the
first Crayola crayon, a colorful and historical
milestone is reached --- the 100 billionth Crayola
crayon rolls off the production line at Binney & Smith
world headquarters in Forks Township, Pennsylvania.
The honor of making the 100 billionth Crayola crayon
is given to Fred Rogers, host of Mister Rogers'
Neighborhood.'

Thanks for posting this info Jeffrey. To mark Mr. Rogers passing I went out
and bought the 64 pack of Crayola's
and have been writing with them. I guess you did too. Thanks :-)

Hi all,

I've got a couple of recordings by poets & writers on ebay right now
that some of y'all may be interested in.

LPs by Charles Olson, Tom Phillips, and Gertrude Stein; a couple of
rare-ish Laurie Anderson 45s, and a CD set of John Cage reading. All
that amid recordings  of new music by Cage, Alvin Lucier, Derek
Bailey and lots of others.

Next week I'll be putting up some S-Press and Membrane cassettes of
more writers; no telling where it will end. To check it out, go to:
<http://cgi6.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewSellersOtherItems&userid=hrebll>

If that doesn't work, search for ebay seller <hrebll>

Thanks.

Concept/Choreography: Foofwa d'Imobilite
Dancerunners: Franziska Koller, Anja Schmidt, Foofwa d'Imobilite

>> I have been constructing sound and text for this work; I have also
constructed two videotapes, danl - about the construct of order from
space-time, and anja - about Lacanian ecstatic states, and Jean d'Arc.
Further, I have constructed a series of 95 still images. In addition, I
have constructed a number of pieces using the 1878 Beatty pump organ, and
the 1987 Mirage Ensoniq. I have also performed on the organ for a video
constructed by Foofwa for part of the initial section of the piece.  In
addition, I have constructed a short series of videos of Anja and Foofwa
for a new piece to be constructed with the Blender 3d program. The text I
have constructed is initially in French; I constructed a further English
translation, replete with errors paralleling the fecundity of the French.
Foofwa has constructed a videotape of my reading of the French text, as
well as the second variant of the French text, which I constructed from a
computer program I constructed from a program constructed by Florian
Cramer. In the organ performance for Foofwa, the camera was focused on the
pumping feet, placing the constructed piece under the aegis of labor. If
music is a construct, I am that construct. If one can speak of a piece of
music, one speaks only of an instantiation of the institutionalization of
a segment of sound lost in the world. If one constructs a piece based and
biased on the losing of the world, one begins the construct of a poetic
based on mourning and labor. If labor is the beginning of the loss of the
world, mourning is the end. If the word gains in the reification of labor,
ululation is its loss and the mourning of that loss. If we can no longer
speak of 'french' as an active, but must employ 'freedom,' then France is
called Freedom. If my work is silent with the fullness of the mouths and
interiority of dance, it speaks with the emptiness of speech and the
exteriority of dance. If it is silent, if it speaks at all. If it speaks,
if it is silent at all.

NO is one bundle that strops local reaction. bunny boy at fever pitch, for
school rules are out. the sky dips down towards a notion of what Hegel
called a closet. and here is Hegel's tweed suit. here too is Hegel's bluff,
forthright shoes. his pantaloons say NO to the standard answer of guff
versus guff. or perhaps that's just a cuff, finely measured and crisp, so to
stand at the lectern and mumble. the lectern itself is yesterday. all the
bunnies sigh. there was a time in the future in which we should or used to
go on in our vision. and that is so lost, so way smoke or tortured off the
screen. that is why with radiance one can claim a next time, it's a walk in
dark forest time. next time, then, won't be author pictures and stuck on the
same charm. NO. next time, notes will be used as oppositional force to the
clarity of war. next time, when the reversals are sewn up, the troupe will
swing thru town and there will be news. it's the newest of news, says the
expert, sparkling with wit to have seen the truth. that will be enough, says
the further step.

The Poetry Center
presents


Poetry Center Book Award reading
Anselm Hollo & Joanne Kyger
Saturday March 8, 7:30 pm,
$5 donation
@ The Unitarian Center
1187 Franklin (& Geary), San Francisco

*  ANSELM HOLLO's Notes on the Possibilities and Attractions of
Existence, a large volume of selected poems 1965-2000  (Coffee House
Press 2001), was selected by Joanne Kyger for the 2001 Poetry Center
Book Award.  She writes:  "Author and translator of over 40 books,
Mr. Hollo has settled through the years into the 'New American
Poetry' and made it a place to 'be' in.  His writing lightly avoids
the glacial aspirations of profundity yet carries the traditions of
wisdom and awareness. . . . This book stays open."  He lives in
Boulder, Colorado.

*  JOANNE KYGER's substantial collection As Ever: Selected Poems,
edited by Michael Rothenberg, is new from Penguin Books, and traces
her work as poet over more than four decades.  In that poetry, as
David Meltzer writes in his Introduction, "Nothing's hidden or
concealed from attention.  If there's a secret, it's anywhere,
everywhere."  She lives in Bolinas, California.

circular (SUHR-kyuh-luhr) adjective

   1. In the shape of or related to a circle.

   2. Roundabout, indirect.

   3. Involving fallacious reasoning that tries to prove something previously

   A widely distributed letter, notice, advertisement, etc.

[From Middle English circuler, from Middle French, from Latin circularis,
from circulus (small circle), diminutive of circus (circle or ring), from
Greek kirkos (circle).]

So the term "three-ring circus" has, in fact, four "rings" in it,
etymologically speaking. Other words derived from the same source
are circuit, circulate, and search (in the sense of "to go around").]

  "In writing or logic classes many of us learned -- and put aside - that

perhaps you could pass on your knowledge of acrobat distiller. a couple
suggestions for PDF'ing text with a fair amount of compression without
losing print (and especially screen) quality would be valuable. i know
i'd benefit from such things.

(Gothic News Service, 3/07/03) The White House sought to dispel rumors today
that the National Endowment for the Arts was in the planning stages for a
series of poetry readings by American poets in Occupied Iraq. For weeks it's
been rumored that the Endowment was in consultation with Laura Bush's office
on ways in which both contemporary and classic American authors could be
best introduced into a post-Saddam Iraq. The First Lady is apparently
convinced that the transmission of American cultural values - especially as
represented in the voices of American poets - is essential to building a
country in which its citizens will be entitled to practice free expression.
To best foster the most attention from the Iraqi public,  it was said that
the Endowment was trying to determine which one of Baghdad's symphony halls
or museums would be an ideal performance location for the invited poets.
Earlier on, a Pentagon  consultant was reported to have suggested that the
Food Distribution Centers would be more ideal since they - in terms of
collateral damage - would be the least likely to be damaged or destroyed
during the bombing of Iraq.

"First," in refuting these claims, the unnamed spokesman for the White House
was quoted as saying, "Though we expect it to be soon forthcoming, there has
been no final decision to either invade or occupy Iraq. Further, any such
program would undoubtedly include other art forms, choirs and such. But, at
this time, we want to remind you, any such planning is totally premature."

When asked whether or not poets to be invited will include those who have
written poems against the war, the spokesman said, "When the time is right,
you will have to refer that question to the head of the Endowment. It's a
free country but we believe he has strongly held views on the questionable
value of combining politics and poetry."

well...the first problem is that every page is an image (i'm assuming a
high-res image)...i'm sure if the image resolution was brought down a bit it
would cut down the file size...how much, i'm not sure...

Using jpg compression in the medium or low range would produce a
drastically smaller file, good for reading electronically, not so
usable to print from.

5.  Dana Gioia in Beulahland

No grants?  No prizes?  No awards?
   No wonder the poets look so bored.
Can art thrive outside New York City?
   What we need here’s a good committee.

O blinding light!  What’s this I see?
   Larkin!  Winters!  Weldon Kees!
A tweedy company of greats—
   At last!  A truly Golden State!

And yet they wear such formal frowns.
   This Beulahland is awfully brown.
These crowns, they’re laurel?  Hard to tell—
   They look a lot like chaparral.

‘Mute spirits, speak!  Where’s this I’ve come?
    Eternity can’t be so glum.’
But the blessed squad ignores my call
    And turns in a reek of alcohol.

I thought to clasp my betters’ hands
   In greeny fields Elysian,
To talk in trochees with the Masters
   While stepping over poetasters.

I labored hard, what dues I paid!
   Tradition ordered, I obeyed.
No politics stained this career.
   Each book so slim!  Each word so dear!

But now as my discerning eye
  Adjusts to the glare of paradise
I find I’ve reached a darker glory
  Among the dim bulbs of Purgatory.

Of course. I have been listening to them since 1966. I have sat in.
And I have all their discs, including the Japanese ones.

postcard poem for jim behrle

are you inordinately proud of your
parking spaces? your clean underwear
speaks to me from the last summer's
laundry basket, crunched into
the bottom between tattered fortunes
and BART passes with only enough fare left
to make it three quarters of the way
home. I, a poet you don't know, am trapped
in the tunnel with nothing but your name
to whisper at whooshing doors, "open-
sesame" style, till somebody lets me
out. If you are a poet too, please
take this note and tape it to
the first parking meter you can find.

Few years back when they were having a day for me at Port Colborne,
they asked me what music i would like, and I said the NSB, and they
came and performed!

Thanks, Chris. I am sure I sounded a bit harsh about Vort. I remember about
1976 trying to read the interview with Robert Kelly before an examination
for a hernia. My mind was not distracted from "matters at hand". But then
again I have never been a great Kelly reader.

I used to be on poetryetc. Is it good these days. And how would I go there.
Sometimes it's a bit of a partch on the Buf list.

Hi Noah,

ISBNs are for books, chapbooks, annuals, or any other print publication to
which you would like to assign one and which is either unique or part of a
series that appears no more frequently than annually. ISSNs are for serials
that appear more frequently than annually. That's my understanding at least.

You can get ISBNs from a company called Bowker at bowker.com. I'm not sure
if you can actually apply for the numbers online, but you can get the info
there, if not. They sell ISBNs in blocks of ten; they assign you the numbers
and you assign the numbers to the titles as you need them and inform Bowker
(who publishes Books in Print) of the assignment.

ISSNs I'm less sure about, but I need to learn more myself, because I need
to get them for Sentence. We can get more info at issn.org. Maybe someone
else on the list will fill us both in.

Hope this helps.

Brian

Hi,

I got my ISBN's for free. The agent in your country gives you a country and
publisher code and the rest of the number is worked out by a formula. .

Due to formulaphobia, they manage to make money by selling the things worked
out for people. But it's easy to do on a spreadsheet.

 White House Unveils New 'Adopt A Bomb' Campaign

They hang the man and flog the woman
That steal the goose from off the common,
But let the greater villain loose
That steals the common from the goose.

Constant apprehension of war has the same tendency
to render the head too large for the body.  A standing military
force with an overgrown executive will not long be safe.

"America is a quarter of a billion people totally misinformed and disinformed
by their government. This is tragic but our media is -- I wouldn't even say
corrupt -- it's just beyond telling us anything that the government doesn't
want us to know."

En Route

No violence,
Feeling may run high for a time, but remember, no violence,
And hurry, this moment of ours may not return.

But we will meet again? Yes, yes, now go,
Take only the lastest instruments, use trained men in conservative
        tweeds who know how to keep their mouths shut,
The key positions must he held at all costs,
Bring guns, ropes, kerosine, it may be hard to persuade our be-
        loved leader there must be no violence, no violence,

No violence, nothing left to chance, no hysteria and above all,
        no sentiment,
The least delay, the slightest mistake means the end, yes, the end--
Why are you worried?

What is there to be worried about? It's fixed, I tell you, fixed,
        there's nothing to it, listen:
We will meet across the continents and years at 4 a.m. outside
        the Greek's when next the barometer reads 28.28 and the
        wind is from the South South-East bringing rain and hail
        and fog and snow;
Until then I travel by dead reckoning and you will take your
     bearings from the stars;

I cannot tell you more, except this: When you give the sign our
        agent will approach and say, "Have you seen the hand-
        writing?" Then your man is to reply, "We have brought
        the money";
So we will make ourselves known to each other,
And it will be the same as before, perhaps even better, and we
        will arrange to meet again, as always, and say good-bye as
        now, and as we always will, and it will be O.K.; now go--

But what if the police find out? What if the wires are down? What
        if credit is refused? What if the banks fail? What if war
        breaks out? What if one of us should die?
What good can all of this be to you, or to us, or to anyone? Think
        of the price--

What are you trying to do, be funny? This is serious;
Hurry;
We must be prepared for anything, anything, anything.

--Kenneth Fearing

Just a plug for a new Melbourne based magazine which is coming into the
world, I am afraid it includes poems by me but apart from that lapse of
taste you might notice there are some good writers in the list of
contributors (below). I include too a snip from a mail by one of the
editors.

And a launch happening at Dante's, Fitzroy (Melbourne) on Friday 21st,
7pm... At which most of the Melbourne contributors will read.<

George W. Bush is saying that because the United Nations isn't voting =
for his war the organization no longer relevant. I suggest that it's =
important for people around the world to affirm their support of the UN, =
and the morality of those nations who are standing up against aggression =
as a way for nations to settle their differences in the 21st Century. It =
seems like the UN has finally grown into the organization it was =
envisioned to be, one that was founded to keep the peace between =
nations.=20
If the UN votes against the invasion of Iraq next week, perhaps poetry =
readings in support of the UN can be put together around the world.=20

Halvard, it's nice to see a Fearing poem, appropriate, too. Now there's a
gifted one who fell through the cracks. Have not read him in so long, I
forget why.

Burning Man Festival Site in Protest Ritual

(Gothic News Service, 3/07/03) Two Rangers at Black Rock Mesa =AD the annual
site in Nevada for the Burning Man Festival - were greeted by a strange
vision this morning. Talking to a Reno newspaperman, one of them reported,
"It was sunrise across the playa and we were on our first patrol. When we
looked down from the perimeter ridge, we initially saw an astonishingly
large grid of either body or garbage bags. Through our binoculars against
the rising sun, we could see that they were definitely filled - it could
have been potatoes or anything big and lumpy. Each bag was spaced about 30
feet away from the next one - about 50 parallel lines going north and south=
,
and about 40 going east and west. The whole thing made a large rectangular
space, about a mile long and a kilometer wide. Frankly I can=B9t say if was
just spooky, or both spooky and spectacular, to see all those black bags
begin to get sun's first rays."

"When we got down inside to the actual site," reported the other Ranger,
"You can't believe what we found in each of those bags. Each one had a
couple of breathing holes, thankfully, for otherwise they were tied down
close with duct tape. I had to use my knife carefully so as not to cut
anything inside. Low and behold, when I opened the first one, it was a body=
.
The first one a female and the next one a male, both in their twenties. Eac=
h
body was in a fetal, curled up shape. Breathing, thankfully, but totally
comatose, or so it seemed.
   =20
    "Yep, not saying a thing," the other ranger interrupted. "Nothing at
all. But more strange, on the back of each body - and now we reckon there
were over 1,000  - someone had scripted in large, lavender letters,  "We
Mourn for Iraq".=20

    "When we cut open a few more bags, we realized that the people were of
all ages and colors. I don=B9t know why, but we both started getting real sad
and had to work real hard =AD opening one bag after another - to keep from
breaking down and crying. I think we're both still pretty upset."

    According to the Reno Newspaperman =AD apart from his interview - nobody
from the local Press was allowed to visit, photograph or film the occasion.
Park and Regional authorities in contact with Attorney General Ashcroft's
office apparently decided that any images of the comatose bodies might
represent a national issue. The rangers did report that it took a full day
to open the bags and deliver the bodies to a local, unidentified military
base. It's not known whether any of the participants have begun to wake up,
whether or not they will be charged with any crime and when or from where
they will be released by the military.

-In Memory of Truth- a new installation by Ligorano/Reese went on view
tonight, at eyewash @ Monk Gallery, 301 Bedford Avenue (Bedford & S. 1st St=
,
Brooklyn.718-782-2458) Nora Ligorano decided she wanted to see a video
screened on the head of a pin and asked her partner Marshall Reese if he
could do it. The result is one of the most exciting installations yet from
this dynamic duo. The optical device looks like a giant microscope and when
you look into it through a magnifier you see a number of films collaged
together screened on the tiny plastic head of a pin! Most of the films are
early war films. The installation also included a large digital wall photo
of Bush at the moment he was told of 9/11 by Andrew Card. All of
Ligorano/Reese=B9s work, most of which incorporate video, contain powerful,
very witty political messages and often operate on a subtle subliminal
level.=20

A recent project of Ligorano/Reese consisted of a John Ashcroft snow globe.
Although obviously the piece was meant as a parody, Ashcroft or some of his
friends were charmed and bought some of the snow globes. Ashcroft was given
one as a gift and evidently he displayed it proudly. The whole episode was
detailed in a recent issue of the New Yorker.

Other recent works of Ligorano/Reese include "Turning Leaves of Mind," an
artists' book collaboration with the poet Gerrit Lansing and "Breakfast of
Champions" a 1991 piece about Desert Storm, exhlbited in the recent
"Critical Consumption" show at the Rotunda Gallery in Brooklyn.

Walter Hamady &
The Perishable Press Ltd

A Retrospective Exhibition (1964-2002)

AT THE GROLIER CLUB
47 East 60th Street
New York, NY 10022

19 February - 26 April 2003



Organized by Dr. Robert Bertholf, Curator of the Poetry and Rare Books =
Collection at the State University of New York, Buffalo, Walter Hamady & =
The Perishable Press Ltd surveys the output of this unique private =
press. Founded in 1964 by Walter S. Hamady, the Press has produced a =
wide-ranging series of titles including poetry by Paul Blackburn, Robert =
Creeley, and Lawrence Ferlinghetti, illustrated by artists such as Sam =
Gilliam, Ellen Lanyon and John Digby, in forms that defy categorization. =
Noted for their fine hand-made paper, distinguished typography, and =
unique colophons, the Perishable Press challenges traditional notions of =
the book. Hamady has said that the name of the Press "reflects the human =
condition which is both perishable and limited," yet its creativity =
indeed seems limitless.

Papermaker, printer, artist, poet, photographer, teacher and publisher =
of handmade books, Walter Hamady established his Perishable Press =
Limited in Mount Horeb, Wisconsin in 1964. As an undergraduate, Hamady =
had become interested in the relationship between poetry and the visual =
arts, and his first printed works-such as Robert Creeley's Words (1965), =
Robert Duncan's Six Prose Pieces (1966) and his collaboration with Aris =
Koutroulis on Consenting Shadows (1966)-combined the two.

Meanwhile, Hamady had begun to craft fine handmade papers at the =
Cranbrook Academy of Arts, eventually developing his own "Shadwell" =
paper: an artisanal, textured sheet in many hues, named for Thomas =
Jefferson's birthplace. These were incorporated into works such as =
Ephemeral Genesis & difficult meanderings in the quest of that that is =
called grand Paradise (1965) and Six Poems and Pictures (1965) as well =
as The Plumfoot Poems: A Summer Sequence (1966). These works brought =
together distinctive aspects of Perishable Press production: fine =
presswork, distinctive handmade papers, collaboration with binder =
Elizabeth Kner, and a combination of the Palatino and Michelangelo types =
(always hand-set) designed by Hermann Zapf for Stempel.

Over the years, the Press has produced a body of work highly sought =
after by collectors, books prized for their meticulous and complex =
physical structures, quirky colophons and inventive collaborations =
between typesetter, binder and illustrator. Joseph Blumenthal noted that =
Hamady's "craftsmanship is nothing short of brilliant, especially in the =
sometimes witty and playful ephemera." Hamady himself describes the book =
as "a living, dynamic possibility-a meeting place for whole worlds of =
divergent elements of human expression to melt and flow, to meld into =
excess beyond the limit of its parts. It is not merely bound pages to be =
sold and shelved and checked out."

The exhibition will be accompanied by a checklist, available for sale at =
the Grolier Club, and from The Veatchs Arts of the Book: PO Box 328, =
Northampton, MA 01061; phone: (413) 584-1867; fax: (413) 584-2751; =
e-mail: Veatchs@veatchs.com.

Thanks for posting this, Kyle.

A lot of people on the Poetics list probably do not know Walter Hamady's
work, largely due to its existence only in small editions of handmade books
that are themselves small works of art. While it is absolutely true to call
attention to the creativity, quirkiness, and meticulous nature of his work,
I'd also like to point out that Hamady embraces several ways of working
that are entirely unusual for letterpress bookmakers. First, he is an
artist who makes the entire book, including paper, printing, imagined book
structures, binding, sometimes illustration, and more, whereas most book
makers specialize in a specific area of book technology. Always, Hamady's
books are wholistic works in which form meets content (form "is" content)
in delightful, and at their best, amazing ways. In addition, Hamady has
always insisted on publishing his contemporaries and peers in the poetry
world, and in seeking out those whose creative vision match and inspire his
own, rather than publishing writers of the past (often the case with
traditional letterpress works) or simply publishing writers who had
established reputations. Hamady also always sees book making as process,
and I remember him saying, of making any kind of art, that if one knows
what one wants to do before beginning, then simply enacts that
foreknowledge, the result is both boring and "not art." Arguable, perhaps,
but it makes Hamady's work have an element of risk and spontaneity that is
extraordinary in book making, and it aligns his work as a book maker more
with poets like Creeley, Duncan, and Blackburn who realize the poem as
process, than with just about any book maker of his time. It is these
qualities that make him an inspiration to those who see his books and to
his students, many of whom have gone on to do significant work in book
making and publishing of various kinds. I am very glad to have been one of
those students.

Crossgates Mall drops charges in T-shirt incident
Guilderland-- Crossgates negates arrest after protesters show up to
support man removed for wearing apparel with peace slogans

By ANNE MILLER, Staff writer
First published: Thursday, March 6, 2003

Crossgates Mall officials have dropped trespassing charges filed
Monday against war protester Steve Downs, who wore a pro-peace T-
shirt
as he walked through the building that afternoon.

The decision to negate the arrest came Wednesday evening, after more
than 100 anti-war protesters descended upon the mall wearing shirts
similar to Downs'.

Tim Kelley, who works for the Pyramid Management Group that manages
Crossgates and other malls throughout New York, said local managers
had called the police.

The decision to drop the charges did not mean mall policy pertaining
to inappropriate clothing had changed, he added.

"We'll have to address these things as they happen," he said.

But Downs said late Wednesday that mall officials are avoiding the
central issue of free speech.

"The fact that they dropped the charges means they don't realize what
the problem really is," he said.

Downs' arrest was the first of its type at the mall, although on Dec.
21 several people wearing similar attire were asked to leave the
mall.
Kelley added that all protesters asked to leave must have been
causing
a commotion. Mall officers have since asked people wearing anti-war
T-shirts to exit the premises.

Shopping "is what (protesters) say they were doing, but that's not
what people tell us they were doing," Kelley said.

The 100 or so protesters met at a mall entrance at noon to support
Downs, who they believe was asked to leave the mall Monday afternoon
because of the message on his shirt: "Peace on Earth" on one side and
"Give Peace a Chance" on the other.

Wednesday's march, which lasted about two hours, was relatively
peaceful, although there was a minor skirmish between a protester and
someone apparently opposed to the anti-war cause. No one was arrested
despite the desire expressed by many that they wanted to be
handcuffed
for their cause.

"This is a policy that's not enforced equally," said Erin O'Brien, an
organizer with Women Against War and a leader of Wednesday's protest.
Her organization sold anti-war, pro-free speech shirts to protesters
for $15, "$12 if you are willing to be arrested in the shirt,"
according to an e-mail sent to supporters. She said she sold about 60
shirts.

About half of those at the mall were anti-war protest veterans. The
rest appeared to be galvanized by what they labeled a civil rights
violation.

"Whatever your belief is, you should be able to wear that," said
Sharon Springs resident Leigha Stuber, 24, who took the early
afternoon off from her job at the Special Olympics office in
Schenectady.

The protest included mothers pushing strollers, youths sporting skull
and crossbones bandannas and salt-and-pepper haired teachers wearing
ties.

"Many in my congregation will not approve of what I'm doing," Pastor
Maggie Sebastian of Tomhannock said. She was prepared to miss Ash
Wednesday services at Poestenkill Christian Church (Disciples of
Christ) if she was arrested. "I have to be true to what I feel God is
calling me to do."

Shortly after 12 p.m., O'Brien led the group into the mall, up the
escalators and into the food court. They occupied tables for about a
half an hour. They then walked past stores and wound up at mall
management offices.

Jared Levin and Ronald Wilson watched some of the goings on from
their
BC Sports Collectibles store. They had mixed opinions on whether the
protesters should be there.

"As long as they're not disrupting anything, it's OK," said Wilson,
the store manager.

But added Levin: "They're disrupting people's lunch."

Henry Marks, a World War II veteran, was eating lunch at the mall
with
his wife. He supports President Bush's stance. His wife is against
the
war.

"I think they could find a better way to spend their time," he said
of
the protesters.

A minor disturbance broke out when one man, dressed in a vest with a
large, black POW patch on the back, raced into the food court at one
point, shoved a man with a no war statement handwritten on his shirt,
and demanded the protesters leave.

"You freaks!" he yelled.

He was quickly ushered away by plainclothes mall security.

Downs' arrest the day before drew worldwide attention.

Guilderland Police Chief James Murley said his offices received
hundreds of e-mails, from California to London, that would have made
his secretaries blush. Officials were called Nazis and worse.

"We didn't go down because the guy was wearing a T-shirt," Murley
said. "We went down because we were called."

According to statements given the police, a customer complained to
Macy's security that Downs and his 31-year-old son, Roger, were
arguing with a group of individuals, and "was afraid of what might
happen."

A mall security officer asked them to remove their shirts, the
statements read. Charges were filed, which Murley said gave the
police
officer no choice but to arrest him. Downs denied confronting anyone.

Mall officials distributed a written statement Wednesday defending
their actions. At first the officials promised that someone would
address the crowd at 1:30 p.m., but after 2 p.m. they said no one
would be available.

A proposal that addresses the issue of free speech in malls was filed
last month in the state Assembly by Suffolk County Democrat Steve
Englebright. The legislation would require privately owned complexes
with at least 20 stores and 250,000 square feet of leasable space to
stipulate in the building's master plan an area where citizens can
congregate to express their opinions. The bill is co-sponsored in the
state Senate by Carl Kruger, a fellow Democrat from Brooklyn.

Colonie Center Marketing Manager Amy Raimo said that her mall does
not
permit protests but would never ask someone to leave because of words
on T-shirts unless they were obscene.

"We sort of have to be like Switzerland," Raimo said. "We don't allow
groups to come in and hand out information on elected officials. We
don't allow church groups."

Professor Lawrence Wittner, who teaches history at the University at
Albany, said the differences in anti-war protests today are that
people are more concerned about the prospect of mass destruction but
find themselves with fewer public outlets for their opinions.

"These malls seem to be walled cities of a kind where freedom of
speech and freedom of assembly is banned," Wittner said.

At Crossgates, the protest disbursed quietly around 2:10 p.m. O'Brien
seemed disappointed.

"What do you have to do to get arrested around here?" she asked.

She said she has been negotiating with mall officials to allow her
organization to set up an information table in the mall. She expects
that to happen next week. Until then, she told the remaining crowd
same place, same time, same protest Sunday afternoon.

 From 23 March to 30 March 2003, the Center of Attention
moves to the land of Google and Yahoo! to present:

THE CENTER OF ATTENTION SEARCH ENGINE

Please join us for the opening reception on
Sunday 23 March, 6 pm to 8 pm at Spanganga Gallery,
3376 19th Street, Mission, San Francisco, California

Some people have already described the 'Center of Attention
Search Engine' as the contemporary art bastard child of
'Antiques Roadshow' and 'American Idol'.

To the more highbrow cultural observer however, this
exhibition will underline the contemporary art gallery as a
non space-specific organisation and address the activity of
a gallery as a search engine, namely through its selection
and curatorial process.

No work is getting transported over from Europe.
The exhibition starts with an empty gallery.

Starting Sunday 23 March and during gallery hours
(everyday 3pm to 8 pm), in an open and public submission
process, artists can bring in work that is discussed with
them before being accepted in the show or rejected.
At other times, the Center's curators will scour artists' studios,
art colleges, talk to people in cafes and cultural spaces
with a view to finding interesting work.

The exhibition becomes a performance: at all times, visitors
can see the making of the exhibition; they can come back
every day to check the progress; they can follow
the curator’s visits and make suggestions.

Check out daily progress on the curators' diary/weblogs:
http://thecenterofattention.blogspot.com
Join us for the opening, bring your work to the gallery or
send this email to artists and friends based on the West Coast.


 ---------------------------------------------------
The Center is looking to operate the search engine in another
location in the autumn and will consider proposals.

That steal the goose from off the common,
But let the greater villain loose
That steals the common from the goose.

Constant apprehension of war has the same tendency
to render the head too large for the body.  A standing military
force with an overgrown executive will not long be safe.

George W. Bush is saying that because the United Nations isn't voting
for his war the organization no longer relevant. I suggest that it's
important for people around the world to affirm their support of the UN,
and the morality of those nations who are standing up against aggression
as a way for nations to settle their differences in the 21st Century. It
seems like the UN has finally grown into the organization it was
envisioned to be, one that was founded to keep the peace between
nations.
If the UN votes against the invasion of Iraq next week, perhaps poetry
readings in support of the UN can be put together around the world.

M/E/A/N/I/N/G Online #2 at Artkrush.com presents:

Collaborations
http://www.artkrush.com/thearticles/024_meaning02/index.asp

M/E/A/N/I/N/G's second on-line issue with Artkrush explores a wide and
fascinating variety of collaborative projects by artists, curators, poets,
and choreographers, including Jane Hammond and Raphael Rubinstein, Brett
Littman, Susan Bee and Charles Bernstein, Michael Mazur, Mimi Gross and
Douglas Dunn, Rachel Owens and Matthew Lusk, Kenny Goldsmith and David
Wondrich, Nora Ligorano and Marshall Reese, Faith Wilding and the
performance collective subRosa.

Essays, project descriptions, and interviews, all fully illustrated,
provide a intricately detailed sense of the possibilities for collaborative
art work, exploring the relation of collaboration to the larger art world
and to international art communities. Collectively, the contributors show
how collaboration is a material practice built upon complex, personal,
daily negotiations between the private and the social. "Collaborations"
provides a new model for working together as artists in the beginning of
the 21st century.

Circular Descent


With a wink and a nod we are pressing Saudi Arabia to monitor charities that
are funded by the tax dollars of people who work with their hands. These
Contributions should not go to clone babies of men who love cats and strong
cheeses; they are not like us. On Tuesday, a woman, pregnant with a
terrorist was due to give birth but declined to give any details about her
terrorist's eating habits. This Terrorist girl bears a cross and a sword
that cuts the heart out of solace in broken streets.  They burned the Jews
alive in Mainz in the Ghetto in 1106 as they went on a journey.



Scientific communities have challenged statements in the past that women
pregnant with terrorists are among us. Doctors and scientists reject
terrorist cloning as irresponsible, saying the risk of creating deformed
terrorists is too great and that it poses ethical dilemmas. The doctor said
that the terrorists are "absolutely healthy." In May three women were
pregnant with terrorists. Clones born because their mother died of a water
borne disease unknown in the green-fat-land.



Mexican farmers tramp through their farms with donkey drawn ploughs.

Planting a rock farm with little black soil, to make the frijoles grow
green.

The ultimate goal that these farmers is to water gardens in suburbia for the
grandchildren of paddys and dagoes. Mexican farmers Increasingly find
themselves saddled with mountains of unsold produce. The produce rots in the
trucks because people like to eat boxes and not dull colored items like
fruit.  Ask them to cut down the beef and dress it well for my table .



Women have fallen and hit the ground hard and on fire-twice in the history
of lower Manhattan. These aliens are so unlike the rest of us; they don't
spend weekends at games and they are mostly communists when they are not
watering lawns in suburbia. We left our brownness somewhere between Ellis
Island, the Triangle Shirtwaste fire and Sacco and Vanzetti.  The clones
live in Central New Jersey and they are green with envy.

 This is sad news. Brakhage helped me make up my mind. Brakhage is
 there in my mind's make-up. That was when I used to go to New York more
than I do now. I found the city overwelming at first, and had
to work on that, so one time I decided the only films I would go to would be
Brakhage films. It was amazing how many I saw, and how vivid my recollection
of them is. I wrote while watching them, the first time I'd ever done that.

Memories of -In Memory of The Truth- a new installation by Ligorano/Reese o=
n
view March 8-April 7 eyewash@Monk Gallery

Woke up this morning thinking about the Ligorano/Reese piece -In Memory of
Truth- "Bush is the pinhead," I thought. On the gallery wall, behind the
viewer through which you can see the films projected on the head of a pin,
hangs a blown up t.v. photo of Bush being told about 9/11 /by Andrew Card.

There is an important reference to "Blade Runner" in this film. While makin=
g
the piece, Marshall called me up to ask me about certain parts of the Ridle=
y
Scott film "Blade Runner" starring Harrison Ford as Deckard, Rutger Hauer a=
s
Batty and Sean Young as Rachel. One question was about Batty's final speech
on the roof after he saves Deckard.The two were fighting to the death near
the roof of a building. Even though moments before, Deckard had killed his
lover, and days before his friend and her lover, Batty allows Deckard to
live. Batty says: "I've seen things you people wouldn't believe. C-beams
glittering near the Tanhauser gate, attack ships on fire over the shoulders
of Orion.All those moments will be lost in time.Time to die." Batty nods hi=
s
head and dies.

On the way back to his apartment, Deckard sees Gaff, the assistant to his
boss. Deckard and Gaff are blade runners, killers hired by the agency to
kill, or "retire" escaped replicants. Gaff says: "Too bad she won't
live.Then again, who does?"

Deckard goes back to his apartment and sees Rachel inert on his bed. For a
moment he doesn't know if she's alive. He calls to her:
"Rachel...Rachel...Rachel..."
He asks: "Do you love me?"
Rachel says: "I love you."
Deckard asks: "Do you trust me?"
She says: "I trust you."
Voice-over of Gaff: "Too bad she won't live. Then again who does?"
Leaving the apartment with Rachel, Deckard sees a silver candy wrapper
origami unicorn Gaff had left on the floor. Gaff had not killed Rachel as
Deckard might have expected him to. Gaff knew Deckard loved Rachel and that
was why he had said: "Too bad she won't live."
Deckard voice- over: "Gaff had been there and let her live. Four years he
figured. He was wrong. Tyrell had told me Rachel was special. No terminatio=
n
date. I didn't know how long we had together. Who does?"

In referencing "Blade Runner" here Ligorano/Reese may be highlighting
several aspects of memory and truth. For one thing, we are living in a
historical moment of crisis when no one knows how long they have to live,
due to the threat of universal nuclear annhilation, which immediately
suggests parallels between the survival of truth and the survival of the
human race, given the stakes in supporting or not supporting the far right
fundamentalist Bush administration at this moment in time.

Also, the interesting issue of close-ups in the film and in -In Memory of
Truth-. In the film, Deckard uses a computer that examines some photos he
found in Leon's apartment. This computer, like the LIgorano/Reese magnifyer=
,
isolates imagery in close-up form. Leon was the first replicant he killed.
By looking at the photo with specialized magnifying equipment, Deckard is
able to see a photograph of Zhora, Leon's strip-teaser girlfriend who works
with an artifical python. Finding the scales of this python,which Deckard
gets examined microscopically by a steet vendor, leads Deckard to Zhora's
workplace. With the close-ups of the photos found in Leon's apartment
(another reference to the struggle to retain memory and truth), Deckard was
able to see Zhora's image reflected in the bathroom mirror, while she is
invisible in the photograph itself.

In evoking truth and memory, Ligorano/Reese may be suggesting that we are
shown only copies of images, and possibly can only decide the truth not so
much from distinguishing memories from reality, but by distinguishing truth
from lies. No matter how closely a pinhead looks at the truth, he or she
will find nothing other than reflections of his or her own conclusions. If
we are to save ourselves from the Tyrells=3D the tyrants, we have to look bac=
k
and forth between our own insights into the images we are presented by the
media, the same images as understood by our own close examination. In any
case, like old war films, the truths repeat themselves again and again, old
movies collaged together and repeated in a loop.

Images of war speak for themselves to anyone but a pinhead. The films
collaged and screened on the plastic head of a pin are: Private
Ryan, Platoon, Rules of Engagement, Blackhawk Down, Pearl Harbor, all
Hollywood films. "You don't need a weatherman to see which way the wind
blows," sang Dylan over 30 years ago. if we look at reality closely for
ourselves, if we examine with great thought and care (=3Dmagnification) the
conclusions subliminally provided for us by the hypnotizing, propagandistic
images pounded into us by mass media, we will remember nothing but what the
powers that be want us to remember. These are not memories, as Deckard says
to Rachel about her memories, these are implants. Like those of Rachel, our
memories are implanted by tyrants by means of mass media manipulations. [I
am reminded here of Steven Matheson's films as well, particularly his "Appl=
e
Grown In Wind Tunnel" discussed in these pages recently.]

Again and again, Ligorano/Reese's installations, by means of multiple
layering of imagery, recording,echoing and and reflecting the ominous
political realities around us, warns us to look very, very closely and
examine reality for ourselves if we want to know the truth, if we want to
survive. We will never understand anything about the truth by looking at
what either the fundamentalist pinhead Bush wants us to see, or what the
corporate mass media reveals to us, since both are blindly counting angels
on the head of a pin and then deceiving themselves and us about it, while
the world around them threatens to implode.

Confucius, Analects, XV.II.1-3. 'The Master said, "Ts'ze, you think, I

[...] 'A certain religious scholar said, "When a son of Adam [i.e. man]
reads the Qur'an, then mingles [good with evil], and then turns [to God]
and reads it again, he is asked [by God], 'What is your relationship with

taboo.'

Marco Polo, Travels. 'Having concluded his prayer, he cried with a loud
voice: "In the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, I command thee, O
mountain, to remove thyself!" Upon these words being uttered, the mountain
moved, and the earth at the same time trembled in a wonderful and alarming
manner. The khalif and all those by whom he was surrounded, were struck
with terror, and remained in a state of stupefaction. Many of the latter
became Christians, and even the khalif secretely embraced Christianity'...

The first time I saw his films, and ever since, I thought he taught me how
to see light, how to feel light. Getting to meet and talk with him a few
years ago was such a pleasure, and a witness to his generosity.

Thanks Charles, Aldon and all for bringing up the memories. Light and the
birth of its multiple refractions was his subject, or a substantial part of
it. I remember one film (1976 or so) - of which I forget the title - in
which the entire content was derived from light flickering through a glass
ash tray that was filmed in the top executive office of a Pittsburgh
skyscraper. You never saw the office or even the ash tray in any
"realistic" sense. You did feel the physical and sensual alacrity that
consumed his eye and process.
I first met him in 1964 at SF State college where he showed (I believe) Dog
Star Trilogy. After the showing about five of us went over to the Cafeteria
where he talked to us about how he would practice (work out) physically
holding and aiming his camera - crouching, swaying, advancing and and
retreating - while letting eye explore the trunk and limbs of the tree, a
kind of love making. The physiology of looking closely (embracing and being
embraced by the subject) seemed to me then and still an extension of Olson's
and Creeley's practices of the poetic line as an extension of the movement
of breath. & undoubtedly accounts for his close relationships with a number
of related poets.
He did tell a story that I never forget about being in San Francisco
sometime in the fifties. On New Year's Day he woke up with a knocking sound
in his ear. He was experiencing some problems in his marriage and he thought
he might be going over the edge since nothing would stop the sound - a
little like that old "tap tap tap" sound in Edgar Allan Poe story of the
scared watchman in the middle of the night on the ship. So he went to a
public hospital. On New Years Day it took forever to finally get a Doctor
who explored the ear in depth with a tweezer device. Up out of the ear and
put before his eye, the Doctor delivered a cockroach!

I forget why he told the story to us young students. I think it was about
the practice of making art and the limits of the imagination. Indeed it was
generous.

The Banner Art Collective (http://bannerart.org/), in collaboration with
Velvet-Strike (http://www.opensorcery.net/velvet-strike/), announces the
Banner-Strike Contest.

Banner-Strike is a contest for digital graffiti and net.art that is
created under specific limitations and which critically examines the
impending war in Iraq.  All entries will be displayed in bannerart.org's
ongoing banner art exhibition and also turned into a Velvet-Strike spray
(to be installed in Counter-Strike).  The winner of the contest will win
the October 2003 release of Counter-Strike: Condition Zero and will be
highlighted on the front page of both sites for one month.

The deadline for submissions is 16 April, 2003.  The winner will be
announced on 18 April, 2003.

- Technical Requirements -

Submitted banners need to be in gif or jpeg/jpg format with no
animation.  All of the following sizes are acceptable: 234x60, 88x31,
120x60, 120x240, 125x125, 240x400, 300x250, 336x280 and 250x250. To
submit, go to bannerart.org and use the submission form upload your work
for review. Please mark in the "special requirements" field on the
upload form that your submission is for the contest and not just for
normal entry to the site's continuing banner art exhibition, submissions
for which are continuing as usual.

All entries will be shrunk proportionally and converted to a spray paint
.wad file by the creators of Velvet-Strike. You can do this conversion
yourself to test how your work might look, by downloading the freeware
application "Wally 1.55b" on the "Counterspray" site
(http://www.counterspray.com/makeyourown.htm). Below is the list of
conversion sizes that will be used:

234x60 half-banner->192x48
88x31 microbar->96x32 (with a transparent border)
120x60 button->96x48
120x240 button->64x128
125x125 button->96x96
240x400 rect->48x80
300x250 rect->96x80

Enough!

(Presented at the _enough_ reading and launch at the Bowery Poetry Club on
March 9, 2003. *** _enough_: an anthology of poetry and writings against
the war, ed. Rick London and Leslie Scalapino [Oakland: O Books, 2003])

In these difficult times, let us not draw away from our poetics in an
attempt to redress the ominous possibilities of future U.S. government
policies or the onerous effects of current government policies. As poets,
we need to pursue our own forms of ethical and aesthetic response rather
than engage in the sort of pronouncement by fiat and moral presumption of
President Bush and his partisans.

In his "State of the Union" message on January 28, 2002, Mr. Bush said,
"America's purpose is more than to follow a process; it is to achieve a
result." This statement alone provides sufficient evidence to oppose his
policies. What our America stands on, its foundation, is a commitment to
process over results, to finding by doing, to thinking by responding.
Solutions made outside of an open-ended process compound whatever problems
we face.

If this statement does not seem forceful enough, if it appears too
uncertain or insufficiently categorically, so be it. If we are to talk of
"poets" against the war, then what is it in our poems -- as opposed to our
positions as citizens -- that does the opposing? Perhaps it might be an
approach to politics, as much as to poetry, that doesn't feel compelled to
repress ambiguity or complexity nor to substitute the righteous monologue
for a skeptic's dialogue.

At these trying time we keep being hectored toward moral discourse, toward
turning our work into digestible messages. This too is a casualty of the
war machine, the undermining of the value of the projects of art, of the
aesthetic.

Art is never secondary to moral discourse but its teacher.

Art, unregulated by a predetermined message, is all the more urgent in a
time of crisis. Indeed, it is a necessary response to crisis, exploring the
deeper roots of our alienation and offering alternative ways not only to
think, but also to imagine and indeed to resist.

A decade ago, just after the previous Persian War, Leslie Scalapino, the
convener of today's session, sent _Dead Souls_, a series of searing
indictments of that war, to a number of newspapers, who declined to
publish, as editorial matter, a kind of writing they found inaccessible.
But the task for poetry is not to translate itself into the language of
social and linguistic norms but to question those norms and, indeed, to
explore the ways they are used to discipline and contain dissent.

Poetry offers not a moral compass but an aesthetic probe. And it can
provide a radical alternative to the outcome-driven thinking that has made
the Official Morality of the State a mockery of ethical thinking and of
international democratic values.

We all saw the effect of outcome-driven thinking  in Florida during the
Fall of 2000, when the Republican National Committee launched a unilateral,
anti-democratic campaign, capturing the state power of the executive branch
from the winner of the popular vote for President. To achieve their goal,
Mr. Bush and his partisans had to turn against their own espoused belief in
states' rights. In the course of their righteous zeal to win at any cost,
the Bush faction turned against the will both of the Supreme Court and the
electorate of the State of Florida. The prestige and integrity of the
United State Supreme Court was collateral damage to Mr. Bush's determined
insistence that ends justify means. The Supreme Court, which we once
thought of as a guarantor or liberty, was exposed as a tool of the
ultra-right wing agenda of the Republican National Committee. This past
week, we have seen this same Supreme Court rule that 50 years of
incarceration is not cruel and unusual punishment for a string of three
petty crimes. Once again, we see the contempt the Chief Justice, Mr.
Rehnquist, and his Star Chamber cohorts, Justices Scalia and Thomas, have
for the shared meaning of our common language, shared meanings that are the
foundation for the system of laws to which we have given consent through
the Bill of Rights to the Constitution.

"Unilateralism" is not just the course the Executive Branch is pursuing,
with disastrous consequence, in foreign policy, but also the policy it
pursues domestically, in its assault on our liberties, on the poor, and
indeed on our aspirations for a democratic society.

So I come here this afternoon, to the Bowery Poetry Club, to say, with all
of you, ENOUGH!

{working notes and phenomenology on the piece, which appeared in two
forms at the Kitchen in NY and will be on tour in Europe,

a work which is difficult to visualize in spite of its relationship to
dance and running, terpsichore and sport. in the latter, one might say
that the spectator watches (in the sense of competition) the signifier
left behind by the runner - the overall time of the event. in the former,
the signifier is internal - what the body _does,_ not what it accomplish-
es. or the means as opposed to the end - or the process as opposed to the
state (x = time-constant) - perhaps operator/operation as opposed to
stating/state. the _regard_ of the spectator at the dance or race. or an
exercise-running or a competition. or the submerged competition among
dances, companies, choreographers, dancers, and the overt competition
among runners. or labanotations opposed to any-winning-articulations of
whatever form.

a work divided into two sections as well - exterior and interior, the
former brought into the proscenium, spectator arena. what of a reversal -
the audience along the route, mobile video carrying the interior section
itself. do we need theaters? do we need theaters any more? the route is
the flow of information, mitigated information and performance among the
city, citying; the route is negotiated, dialog, dialectic. the interior
part is institutionalized, financed, already an economy. within the
interior, the audience-organs perform specific roles; the dancers are the
lungs and feet - the dancers in this instance are the bodies of the
audience, we want to run.

neither dance nor running, but an alliance or allegiance with the air, the
atmosphere, the spacing of the globe. they're a breath of fresh air, who
let the air in, we're giving ourselves airs, the air's a bit thick in
here, the air is the window of the soul. wavering among forms and among
bodies poised for dance, competition, running, adulation, exhaustion,
dying, rebirth, presentation, re-presentation - the event or eventing is a
becoming, not of deconstruction or disinstitutionalization, but of a
loosening of territories, not a territorialization or deterritorializa-
tion, but an opening, which is also an opening, in these dark times, of
_gladness._ it's this gladness which breathes of landscapes without
viewers, of eyes without minds, of a natural world without tending, with
tendency.

a work shaking loose notions of _work,_ at the same time tending towards
exhaustion - dancers taking breaks when necessary, covering and recovering
similar grounds when unnecessary, always _untethering,_ from running, from
dance, from dance-run, from run-dance, run-run and dance-dance, a broken
cartesian skein. - then again, this prowess and opening towards gladness.

How easy it would have been towards accolade! Carlyle's bowing figures in
the early moment, pushed beyond their limits, arms in the air, breaking
the ribbon at last! Such that England wins!

...drowned or ruined cities, submerged accolades, momentary stases, the
coming recognitions, flooded sports arenas, flooded theaters, homes,
palaces, bunkers, markets, cathedrals, the world gone upside-down...

in which the body is found between function and form, or rather form into
function which returns to form, or rather decathecting and looking (rather
than watching, i.e. watching a dance or watching a sports event, we looked
at this performance

which keeps continuing, as if there's no end to the variations, nothing of
imminent logic for example, nothing of teleology (rather than figures of
violin, of tamboura or something slowly borrowed or roughly pulsing, of
which this is a segment

in which the body keeps continuing, or finding or found, or running or
drowning, as if there's no end and nothing of it (muscle, not brawn

submerged

Dee Hock:
"It is futile to directly challenge such institutions, political or commercial,
for they have an oligopoly on power, money and instruments of compulsion. Nor do
they hesitate to use them if threatened. However, they will prove to be
vulnerable, rusted out hulks if confronted with new and better ideas of
organization which transcend and enfold them. Ideas that excite the very people
they expect to remain passive. What they cannot resist is the searchlight of
informed public opinion. Once the public begins to withdraw relevance from them
they are helpless, as Gandhi so ably demonstrated in India. While I don't begin
to understand Blogging, your paper set something turning in the back of my mind
that whispers it may be one of the keys to the puzzle."

BANGALORE, India (AP) - Every year, tens of thousands of women gather at =
a Hindu temple in southern India and worship in the nude, despite =
efforts to stop them.=20

For 17 years, authorities and social reformers have tried to prevent the =
devotees from disrobing as they bathe in the Bhadra River and roll =
around the temple of the Hindu goddess Renukamba. And on Wednesday, =
officials said they have once again banned nudity during the temple fair =
from March 9-11 in the village of Chandragutti in Karnataka state.=20

Many of the devotees are young women who are performing an initiation =
rite to enter prostitution, while others are fulfilling vows they have =
made to the goddess.=20

Tushar Girinath, the deputy commissioner for the Shimoga district, said =
devotees can perform all the rituals, but they must remain clothed.=20

He has also ordered all liquor shops within a five-kilometre radius of =
the temple closed during the fair to keep people from becoming unruly.=20

In 1986, worshippers became angry at attempts to stop them. They =
stripped the police, journalists and the social activists and forced =
them to parade naked.=20

Patrick J Sloyan on how the mass slaughter of a group of Iraqis went=20
unreported

Friday February 14, 2003
The Guardian

On February 25 1991 the war correspondent Leon Daniel arrived at a=20
battlefield at the tip of the neutral zone between Iraq and Saudi Arabia.=20
Daniel was one of a pool of journalists who had been held back from=20
witnessing action the previous day, when Desert Storm's ground war had been=
=20
launched. There, right where he was standing, 8,400 soldiers of the US=20
First Infantry Division - known as the Big Red One - had attacked an=20
estimated 8,000 Iraqis with 3,000 Abrams main battle tanks, Bradley=20
fighting vehicles, Humvees and armoured personnel carriers.
Daniel had seen the aftermath of modest firefights in Vietnam. "The bodies=
=20
would be stacked up like cordwood," he recalled. Yet this ferocious attack=
=20
had not produced a single visible body. It was a battlefield without the=20
stench of urine, faeces, blood and bits of flesh. Daniel wondered what=20
happened to the estimated 6,000 Iraqi defenders who had vanished. "Where=20
are the bodies?" he finally asked the First Division's public affairs=20
officer, an army major. "What bodies?" the major replied.
Months later, Daniel and the world would learn why the dead had eluded=20
eyewitnesses, cameras and video footage. Thousands of Iraqi soldiers, some=
=20
of them firing their weapons from first world war-style trenches, had been=
=20
buried by ploughs mounted on Abrams tanks. The tanks had flanked the lines=
=20
so that tons of sand from the plough spoil had funnelled into the trenches.=
=20
Just behind the tanks, straddling the trench line, came Bradleys pumping=20
machine-gun bullets into Iraqi troops.
"I came through right after the lead company," said Colonel Anthony Moreno.=
=20
"What you saw was a bunch of buried trenches with people's arms and legs=20
sticking out of them. For all I know, we could have killed thousands."
Two other brigades used the same tank-mounted ploughs and Bradleys to=20
obliterate an estimated 70 miles of defensive trenches. They moved swiftly.=
=20
The operation had been rehearsed repeatedly, weeks before, on a mile-long=20
trench line built according to satellite photographs. The finishing touches=
=20
were made by armoured combat earth-movers (ACEs). These massive bulldozers,=
=20
with armoured cockpits impervious to small-arms fire, smoothed away any=20
hint of the carnage. "A lot of guys were scared, but I enjoyed it," said=20
PFC Joe Queen, an ACE driver awarded a Bronze Star for his performance in=20
the battle.
What happened in the neutral zone that day is a metaphor for the art of war=
=20
in an era when domestic politics is often more important than the=20
predictable outcome on the field of battle. In 1991 American voters rallied=
=20
behind President George Bush Sr for the seemingly bloodless confrontation=20
with Saddam Hussein. Neatly hidden from a small army of journalists was the=
=20
reality of war - a reality that can make these very same voters recoil in=20
disapproval.
His son is likely to use the same sort of tactics to blind one of the=20
world's freest and most influential media establishments. Running the show=
=20
for President George Bush is the man who manipulated global perceptions of=
=20
the first Gulf war for Bush Sr: Dick Cheney. Then defence secretary and now=
=20
vice-president, Cheney is likely to buffalo the New York Times, the=20
Associated Press, CNN and others ready to bend to US government censorship.
According to White House officials, no final decisions have been made by=20
Bush, Cheney and current defence secretary Donald Rumsfeld. "We're still=20
negotiating with the media," said one administration official. But Bush has=
=20
already implemented ground rules that require journalists to give up their=
=20
mobile and satellite phones to military commanders who would control the=20
movements of these so-called pool reporters during Desert Storm II. If the=
=20
final rules, organised by the Pentagon, are anything like the pool system=20
designed by Bush Sr and Cheney in 1991, the world will be given a cloudy=20
mixture of video footage and misinformation that will fog the reality of=
 war.
Daniel, the wire service veteran, was part of the 1991 pool system. About=20
150 American journalists, photographers and film crews were scattered among=
=20
attacking units. Their reports were supposed to be fed to a rear=20
headquarters and then shared by hundreds of journalists from around the=20
world. "They wouldn't let us see anything," said Daniel, who has seen just=
=20
about everything there is to see in war. Not a single eyewitness account,=20
photograph or strip of video of combat between 400,000 soldiers in the=20
desert was produced by this battalion of professional observers.
Most of the grisly photos from Desert Storm seen today were the work of=20
independent journalists who raced to the "Highway of Death" north of=20
Kuwait, where war planes had destroyed thousands of vehicles in which Iraqi=
=20
soldiers had fled after the start of the ground war. The area was free of=20
the military handlers who routinely interrupted interviews to chastise=20
soldiers into changing their statements while reporters stood back, or=20
forcibly removed film from cameras that captured images deemed offensive by=
=20
an Army public affairs officer.
Cheney, brimming with contempt and hostility for the press, saw journalists=
=20
as critics of the military who must be contained. "Frankly, I looked on it=
=20
as a problem to be managed," he said after the war. "The information=20
function was extraordinarily important. I did not have a lot of confidence=
=20
that I could leave that to the press."
Since being brought into government as an intern by Donald Rumsfeld, then a=
=20
congressman, Cheney has spent most of his adult life fencing with the media=
=20
and learning its strengths and weaknesses. A stunning victory in 1991 was=20
the media's agreement to permit the Pentagon to censor journalists' reports=
=20
before they were printed or broadcast. In the past the Pentagon had left=20
censorship up to individual reporters. During 10 years of war in Vietnam,=20
not one journalist violated self-imposed rules against reporting, for=20
example, specific locations of attacks.
As a result, the conventional wisdom was that the government was not=20
violating the First Amendment to the Constitution: that Congress "will make=
=20
no law to abridge [. . .] freedom of the press". Only a handful of=20
journalists went to federal court to challenge the government censorship=20
imposed by Bush, Cheney and Colin Powell, chairman of the joint chiefs of=20
staff. The court ruled the suit moot - the war was over - but invited the=20
press to try again so that the issue might be settled. It never was.
The media was more duped than cowed. Cheney won over some people with the=20
promise that places in the pool would give them an advantage over=20
competitors. For instance, a Washington Post pool reporter kept to himself=
=20
all details of a US Marine operation for exclusive use by the Post and,=20
later, a book.
For independent journalists, life was much more difficult. More than 70=20
operating outside the pool system were arrested, detained, threatened at=20
gunpoint or chased from the front line. Army public affairs officers made=20
nightly visits to hotels and restaurants in Hafir al Batin, a Saudi town on=
=20
the Iraqi border. Reporters and photographers would bolt from the table.=20
The slower ones were arrested.
But when the ground war started, the mighty were hamstrung along with the=20
mediocre. The Associated Press, which benefited most from a system that=20
turned all journalists into wire service reporters, sent photographer Scott=
=20
Applewhite to cover victims of a Scud missile attack near Dahran. The=20
warhead had hit an American tent, killing 25 army reservists and wounding=20
70. It was the single biggest loss to Saddam Hussein during Desert Storm.=20
Applewhite, an accredited pool member, was stopped by US Army military=20
police. When he objected, they punched and handcuffed him while ripping the=
=20
film from his cameras.
Cheney made sure it was just as bad for the rest of the pool. When the=20
ground war started, the defence secretary declared a "media blackout",=20
blocking all reports. After the war, General Norman Schwarzkopf and his=20
aides revealed that the blackout was ordered because of fears that Saddam=20
would use chemical weapons on allied forces. Potential news reports of=20
soldiers writhing in agony from a cloud of sarin nerve gas had spooked the=
=20
president and his commanders. "No pictures of that," said General Richard=20
Neal, who directed ground operations during the war.
As a result, reports and film were delayed or "lost" by military commanders=
=20
so that most of it arrived too late for most deadlines. Neal and=20
Schwarzkopf provided the bulk of briefings and videos in Saudi Arabia, and=
=20
these were the first reports to filter through; many became the basis of=20
the most lasting perceptions of Desert Storm. Gun camera footage always=20
showed empty bridges or aircraft hangars being destroyed by "smart bombs" -=
=20
laser-guided munitions that never struck a single human. But only 6% of the=
=20
munitions used against Iraq could be guided to a target. Over 94% were far=
=20
less surgical during the 30-day air war, which often saw 400 sorties a day.=
=20
Those bombs depended on gravity and variable winds, and were capable of=20
causing "collateral damage" to nearby unarmed civilians.
The global television audience was awed by Tomahawk cruise missiles roaring=
=20
from the decks of US Navy warships at sea. But less than 10% hit their=20
targets. The missile's accuracy depends on landmarks that can be spotted by=
=20
an on-board camera that can shift the weapon's direction. But the=20
featureless desert led many Tomahawks to wander away like so many lost=20
patrols, according to Pentagon studies.
Schwarzkopf conducted televised briefings about the allied counterattack on=
=20
Saddam's Scud missiles that had terrorised Saudi Arabia as well as Israel.=
=20
Yet an air force study after the war showed that Iraq had ended up with as=
=20
many Scud launchers as it had possessed before the war started. A murky=20
Schwarzkopf video showed the destruction of what seemed to be a Scud=20
launcher, but later turned out to be a bombed oil truck.
Controlling the briefings, the videos and the press during Desert Storm was=
=20
an extension of US policy started by President Ronald Reagan and his=20
defence chief, Caspar Weinberger. It was Weinberger, an anglophile, who=20
admired Margaret Thatcher's manipulation of the media during the Falklands=
=20
war, which led directly to her political revival in 1982. A year later,=20
Weinberger took control of the US media when Reagan found himself in a=20
deepening hole in Lebanon.
On October 23 1983, 241 US Marines died after a truck laden with explosives=
=20
destroyed a makeshift barracks at Beirut airport. The massacre suddenly=20
focused attention on the ageing actor's foreign policy decisions as the=20
reports and pictures showed the removal of American bodies. Within 48 hours=
=20
of the bombing, the president dispatched the first wave of 5,000 American=20
troops to Grenada in the Caribbean.
But the invasion angered Thatcher. Grenada was linked to the UK as a member=
=20
of the Commonwealth. Only the previous week, Washington had informed London=
=20
that there was no need for outside intervention, as local political turmoil=
=20
was likely to play itself out without further bloodshed. Geoffrey Howe,=20
Britain's foreign minister, was explicit. "The invasion of Grenada was=20
clearly designed to divert attention," Howe said in an interview. "You had=
=20
disaster in Beirut; now triumph in Grenada. 'Don't look there,' " he said,=
=20
gesturing with his forefinger, " 'look over here.' "
Reporters were banned from Grenada. Those who tried to land on the island,=
=20
such as Morris Thompson of Newsday, were arrested and imprisoned on US=20
ships offshore. All details and videos were supplied by military reporters=
=20
and photographers at Pentagon briefings.
The media barons howled, but little changed. When Bush Sr invaded Panama in=
=20
1989, journalists were once again banned. Democratic congressman Charles=20
Rangle of New York still insists that as many as 5,000 civilians in Panama=
=20
City were killed by US invaders. But there are no pictures, no eyewitness=20
accounts.
The invasion of Panama and the arrest of Manuel Noriega were, like Desert=20
Storm later, something of a political triumph for Bush. But the reality of=
=20
that particular war asserted itself during a televised briefing by the=20
president. It was just at the end of the session, when Bush was=20
wisecracking with reporters, that most networks split their screens to show=
=20
the arrival of dead US soldiers from Panama.
Bush was caught bantering as flag-draped coffins arrived at an air force=20
base in Dover, Delaware - a military mortuary. Later that week, Bush=20
ordered the press banned from covering the arrival ceremonies for the=20
fallen. President Clinton continued the ban. And his successor, President=20
George Bush, also wants to keep the dead out of the national limelight.

what should we do?

to the very few
  or none of us or them

all are dead or dying

hammer the stirrup questions

there is a call to strike the cyclorama

New Bush Portrait Found Hanging Upside Down from Mount Rushmore

(Presidential News Service, 3/10/03) Early Sunday morning visitors to Mount
Rushmore reported that they were astonished to find they could not look up
the 5,725-foot mountain and see the 60-foot high carved stone heads of U.S
Presidents George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Theodore Roosevelt, and
Abraham Lincoln. Instead, they found themselves looking at a large painted
portrait of President Bush hanging upside down on a cable stretched several
hundred feet between the barely exposed foreheads of Lincoln and Washington=
.
Visitors reported that not only was the painted Bush upside down, but that
his bright red cheeks and much ruffled dark hair indicated signs of
considerable shaking, an effect that was amplified by the canvas rippling i=
n
the early March wind. Indeed it appeared that a group of artists or
individuals had picked him by his feet and held him hanging down for a long
period of time while the portrait was in progress.

"Drop The Thought" - the visitor went on to report - was painted in large
block letters across the top of the canvas which hung down at least 60 feet
to cover the sight of the other Presidential faces.

Before News reporters could be called to the scene, National Park
authorities brought in two helicopters to lift the cable and canvas from th=
e
Monument. "That was also quite something," a visitor reported. "The canvas
shook terribly when they lifted Bush=B9s face up into the air. It was as if h=
e
was having an exorcism or some kind of letting go. Then, when the
helicopters got him balanced to leave, they turned the canvas around and,
and on the back side, all we see were big lavender colored letters saying,
NO WAR IN IRAQ. Frankly, it was kind of powerful sight. Like a lot of
people, I am not particularly for going into this war."

It was hard to find much other information. Mount Rushmore =AD carved over a
period of 14 years by sculptor Gutzon Borglum - was created to embody the
spirit of the foundation, preservation, and expansion of the United States.
Tight lipped, The National Park Service said it did not have any informatio=
n
on the perpetrators of the morning=B9s event and no arrests had been made.

"At a time when the country and the President most need the support of the
American people," Ari Fleischer said, "It is disturbing to hear that there
are individuals out there who will abuse an historic Monument that
represents our nation=B9s ambition, power and democratic purpose. As to the
alleged portrait, let it be known, one more time, this President will not b=
e
shaken in his resolve to go to war, if that is his decision."

Hey, Gabe,

Hope you had a good trip to AWP. I'm wondering if I can ask one more
question about your book? One of my students has been ill, and I don't think
she ever got around to mailing you. She wondered if you think there's a
difference between male and female humor. Sh thought your humor tended
toward what she calls "male." Any thoughts on this?

My students really loved your book. I plan to teach it again since it worked
so very well and raised so many great questions.

Best,

Josh

QUESTION 1:
Doctors have invented a new implant which can be placed in the brains of=20
newborns to prevent all forms of suffering for a lifetime.  Is this a good=20
choice?  Explain your answer.

THE ANSWERS:
  =20
ANSELM BERRIGAN
No.  Is the implant some kind of life-lasting inner joint or something?  And=
=20
that seems to imply that joy and suffering can be implanted (I mean if you=20
can eliminate suffering you can probably double the load too, right?) --=20
i.e.: if some non-sufferers have some bombs dropped on their heads are they=20
not going to suffer?
---------

BUCK DOWNS
Steve Abbott had a questionnaire form for poets that I assume got distribute=
d=20
around to his students & they used it, because it wasn't Steve who sent it t=
o=20
Joe Brainard.  Joe did try to answer it pretty honestly even though the=20
questions were all not ones that applied much to the life that Joe was=20
living.  For example, there was a question about significant audio & all Joe=
=20
could say was I have a tape by Morrissey because so-and-so gave it to me & I=
=20
listen to it some because I have it, and a question about flying saucers tha=
t=20
shows Joe to have been more or less indifferent to the phenomenon of=20
humanity's projection of its self-image onto foreign rocks & into strange=20
cans.

I never think of suffering in the way this question thinks of it.  I think o=
f=20
my sore knee, I think of my mom's bronchitis or Tom Raworth's, etc. etc. The=
=20
race of newborns and the race of doctors are both demographic fictions that=20
don't correlate to the life I live.  I would not trust any scientist or=20
medical professional who accepted the concept embodied in this question as a=
=20
principle for research; I would expect them to be a serious fuckup, and the=20
inventor of some high-priced piece of shit that would first magnify human=20
suffering to catastrophic levels before addressing it, and then failing to=20
address it in any significant way, and mostly leaving a big mess for cracker=
s=20
like me to have to come clean up and/or pay for.

I would be a lot more impressed if these doctors would come up with a pop to=
=20
give my mom or Tom that would undo a lifetime of cigarette smoking and life=20
and give them back undiminished lung capacity.  Or any other serious effort=20
to tackle an actual problem.

Ugh. I think this question was supposed to be a big fat softball that would=20
allow me to rhapsodize in a long eloquent 'statement' about the beautiful=20
animal man [sic] and s/her ability to transcend bad breaks & shit; sorry to=20
have blown it, but I don't give a fuck about 'newborns' or any other=20
abstracted classes of humanity at all.  Demographic abstraction is an enemy=20
of human contact, and human contact is all poetry has left going for it in=20
the media/market/culture that is its substrate.  Everything else, as Dave=20
Hickey once said, is advertising and term-papers.
---------

MYTILI JAGANNATHAN
I guess I disagree with the premises and assumptions of this question.  Firs=
t=20
of all, on a very basic level, allopathic medical science has a lot to learn=
=20
about the operations of even "physical" pain, let alone emotional pain and=20
suffering.  I mean, just to take something widely diagnosed in the U.S. like=
=20
depression; sure, there are drugs that have been invented that do help some=20
people, presumably by acting on neurotransmitters, but even the details of=20
this process are unclear to scientists.  Also unanswered (perhaps=20
unanswerable) is the question of causality=97-are changes in brain chemistry=
=20
the cause of depression, or does depression cause changes in brain chemistry=
?=20
 And organic bodily processes are not simply "mechanical"=97they're=20
informational and "intelligent," so even something like genetic engineering=20
is more complex than discrete and dramatic on-and-off switches.  And other=20
kinds of suffering:  what is suffering?  How could you catalog, much less=20
prevent "all forms" of it?

So that's one part of my objection.  The other part is that a lot of=20
suffering-as-we-know-it (which is where we begin, after all) is intricately=20
bound up with social/political/economic relations and our experience as part=
=20
of collective forms/structures that have powerful energies and effects  (nee=
d=20
I point out the previously unimaginable scope of contemporary global=20
capitalism?).  Of course there are biological factors that influence physica=
l=20
and psychic experiences, but such factors are always in play with=20
environmental conditions, in the broadest sense of "environment."  So, I=20
think that "suffering" is not an individual condition that can be "solved" b=
y=20
genetic/medical solutions.

I think that socially, politically, prophetically, if you like, of course=20
struggles for justice proceed with the "end of suffering" as a horizon, but=20
it's just as important how we imagine and enact those transformative=20
processes.  I think the processes are inherently social, material,=20
relational, and yes, embodied; but it's certainly not going to come about=20
through any top-down techno/medical Big Bang.  And creating a dynamic,=20
relational justice doesn't necessarily mean the end of all pain (we won't=20
overcome mortality, after all, we're dying all the time at the cellular=20
level, and extending old-age might even create as-yet-unexperienced forms of=
=20
pain, who knows?), but an end to those social structures that "freeze" or=20
institutionalize suffering.
---------

KEVIN KILLIAN
I hope they invent a similar implant that would induce tolerance and respect=
=20
as well, otherwise what's to prevent the human race from turning cruel if no=
=20
other human will suffer because of the first implant?  Then our animal=20
friends among other species will be living worse lives than ever.  Save the=20
animals now!
---------

EILEEN MYLES
No this is a bad choice. They would have to be adjusting it constantly which=
=20
would disturb the growing infants sense of balance. Actually I think they=20
have already done this and it is vaccinations and they have so much mercury=20
in them that kids are coming up autistic.
---------

ALICE NOTLEY
What are 'all forms of suffering'?  How can science define them?  I wouldn't=
=20
let a scientist define what constitutes suffering -- I know you are after an=
=20
answer concerning the role of suffering in existence and whether living woul=
d=20
be better if suffering were eliminated, but I can't relate to the idea of th=
e=20
scientist or doctor as the eliminator of suffering.  Or is it that you are=20
thinking only of disease and physical difference as forms of suffering?  I=20
tend to think of suffering as something caused by other humans -- I tend to=20
think of the other animals as beings who don't suffer unless we cause them t=
o=20
suffer or who perhaps suffer in their death throes but not much before.  If=20
you want to know if suffering is of value, that's a different question.  I=20
would prefer not to suffer and I would prefer that others not suffer even=20
more than I do -- to know that they do is horrible and makes me feel guilty.=
 =20
But there is no 'doctor' and to even fantasize one is to miss the point:  th=
e=20
doctor helps create suffering by presuming to know more about its forms than=
=20
others do.  My suffering has been of value to me partly because it has=20
rescued me from the doctors and their mechanistic view of reality.  But I=20
don't think I should have had to suffer in order to find out what I know.
---------

GIL OTT
Answering this question can only be a matter of faith, replacing a spiritual=
=20
entity with "science." I think the question is asked more playfully than=20
that, but I don't think there's any other way to honestly answer it. A poet=20
recognizes that it's one's suffering (or vulnerability) which determines=20
one's character - I recently read a passage in Rilke's Brigge reaffirming=20
this, though I can't locate the exact passage now - so the question itself i=
s=20
moot. More likely: If the suffering person could escape his suffering, would=
=20
he (which raises the nearly redundant: could he, and still be himself?)? A=20
point of honor among contemporary disability activists is that they would no=
t=20
accept the cure for their conditions, were one concocted. Disregarding the=20
inexactitude of applied science, and the concomitant sufferings it inflicts=20
on subjects in pursuit of cures, the question becomes one of identity.

Now ask me that question: Could science free me from the notion of identity,=
=20
would I take the cure? But then, perhaps science, or some agency, would=20
necessarily supply me with a reliable identity to start with.
---------

FRANK SHERLOCK
Of course this is a terrible idea! It can only lead to fascism.  Those of us=
=20
already walking the earth sans suffer block will be forced to suffer for=20
those who can't feel it. Camps. Torture. Entertainment.
---------

MAGDALENA ZURAWSKI
Don't you think that a prevention from suffering would be a kind of sufferin=
g=20
in itself? People with the implant would wander through a culture without th=
e=20
possibility of empathy. What an alienating feeling!! Imagine the loneliness=20
when listening to cowboy songs about loneliness knowing that you do not know=
=20
the loneliness they sing!! Having such an implant would probably be very=20
similar to watching war live on CNN. This week I saw a movie and the girl=20
said "I just want to feel loved" and the boy said "I just want to feel." And=
=20
it seemed to sum things up in a nutshell. I wasn't even stoned when I saw it=
=20
and I thought "I used to be the boy, but now I'm the girl." I think the=20
implant would keep us all on the boy's side of things. It's a terrible place=
.=20
I'd rather be lonely than be lonely, if you know what I mean.=20
---------


QUESTION 2:
There's a face of a poet on the kite you are flying over the city.  Who is=20
this poet?  When you reel them back from the wind what will you ask?

THE ANSWERS:

ANSELM BERRIGAN
Face of Steve Carey. Steve, how did you get here?
---------

BUCK DOWNS
well if it's my kite I must've painted drawn or ironed-on the poet's picture=
=20
since it's not likely that I'll be buying any e.g., Jack Spicer regalia, or=20
anything else, at Toys-R-Us anytime soon.

Was it Jack Spicer who said,

"I think that I shall never cite
 a poem as lovely as a kite?"

of course it wasn't. It was I, or actually, me.

I hope I would have the perspicacity not to reel in the kite at all, but get=
=20
it up to a way cool height & then cut the string, allowing the kite to crash=
=20
in a faraway place like Baltimore or even Glen Burnie, where a youngun would=
=20
find it & say, "did Jack Spicer run for President, or what?".
---------

MYTILI JAGANNATHAN
Interesting: the form of this question=97-the delicacy, intimacy, and magica=
l=20
quality of this imagined act=97-makes me think of the Chilean poet and artis=
t=20
Cecilia Vicu=F1a.  She grew up in Santiago, supported Allende's participator=
y=20
socialist government, and lived in exile after Allende's murder and the long=
=20
horror of Pinochet.  "Thread" is a central figure=97-both material and=20
symbolic=97-in her poetry and installations. All of her work seems to be a k=
ind=20
of "activation": making visible and visceral the reality that we are all=20
connected.  It sounds so simple conceptually but it's so incredibly powerful=
.=20
 She's done installations where she has woven threads connecting two sides o=
f=20
a street, or the opposite banks of a river, both below and above the water's=
=20
surface.  I've seen a photograph of an action she did in Bogata, Columbia, t=
o=20
protest the distribution of contaminated milk.  It was called "Vaso de=20
leche": she announced beforehand the time and location of her action.  At th=
e=20
appointed time, she pulled on a long piece of red yarn that was wrapped=20
around the a glass of milk, spilling it into the street.  Then she wrote a=20
poem in the street: "The cow/is the continent/whose milk (blood)/ is spilt./=
=20
What are we doing/ with life?" Cecilia says: "I look at things backwards, as=
=20
they are going to look when I am gone.  I have a very intense feeling that=20
what we do is already the remains of what we are doing.  The dead water, our=
=20
poems."

So this is why your fascinating image of this face on a kite, held by a=20
string, floating over the city, reminds me of her.  I'm not sure I can guess=
=20
what words she'd say, perhaps some new instance of her practice of poetic=20
etymologies emerging from what she saw across Philly, breaking words apart=20
"so that their internal metaphors were exposed" and new paths of meaning=20
revealed.  One of my favorite of these etymologies she's done:=20
"SOL-I-DAR-I-DAD (Give and give sun)."  What spaces, what words would she=20
thread together in Philadelphia?
---------

KEVIN KILLIAN
The poet is Ronald Johnson, and when the kite comes back I'll ask that face,=
=20
will you ever forgive me?
---------

EILEEN MYLES
Bob Kaufman. How did it feel?

ALICE NOTLEY
No identifiable face -- it keeps changing.  (No special poet.)  The question=
=20
I ask is awful.
---------

GIL OTT
The poet's face on my kite is Frank Samperi, reclusive when he was alive, bu=
t=20
now deceased at least a decade. I would ask him to elaborate on the word=20
"procession," which he used to distinguish from "process." I imagine this=20
man's mind as pure witness, tuned to the essential deity of events, and so=20
endangered.

QUESTION 3:
You open a book that won't close.  Maybe you accept it?  Maybe you struggle=20
to close it?  Each chapter is titled INSTRUCTIONS FOR POETS.  Instead of=20
words a variety of strange shapes fill the pages.  The last page is blank so=
=20
you can communicate to other poets an idea you feel is vital.  The only=20
requirement is that you use no words, but draw a picture instead.  Describe=20
what you would draw.  Explain the drawing if you want, although it might be=20
more interesting to let us figure it out.

THE ANSWERS:

ANSELM BERRIGAN
I would draw a three-dimensional cube.

BUCK DOWNS
In the alternate universe from which this question comes and in which I can=20

picture of my parents fucking, in honor of the great creative power of cock=20=

cunt that makes the human race go cat go.
---------

MYTILI JAGANNATHAN
A book that won't close=97-another magical image, reminds me of my earliest=20
obsession with fairy tales.  But  I don't know what I would draw.  If I can=20
pile magic upon magic here, perhaps this: a page of unidentified animal=20
sounds, actually heard when the page is touched.

KEVIN KILLIAN
A drawing of a green fairy, sprung from the absinthe label, quickening silve=

The drawing is of a human torso between the shoulders, throat area and just=20
below the navel.  Above the navel are several holes, small rather blurred=20
circles in which one can see the remnants of letters of the alphabet without=
=20
being able to make them out precisely.  An upper curve of a P or B or R for=20
example, but what you see looks damaged as if the letter has been roughly=20
pulled out.  One is not sure if there are four or five holes because one of=20
them is so faint.  However, it is possible to see that the holes are=20
bleeding.  One has the impression that a word has been ripped out of the=20
torso and what is left are the ghosts of letters, the ghost of a word.
---------

GIL OTT
This question is too cute. I am a poet, a writer, a word artist, and my=20
medium is words. Indeed, "strange shapes fill the pages" when I read, but=20
their articulation is verbal. In my experience, an image is a knot,

QUESTION 4:
S.A.M., the three things Elizabeth Bishop believed made a satisfying poem: =20
Spontaneity, Accuracy, Mystery.  How does this compare with what you look fo=
r=20
in a poem?  Or do you have an acronym of your own?

THE ANSWERS:

ANSELM BERRIGAN
I don't know, I haven't known how to answer this one. I'm afraid that lookin=
g=20
for satisfying elements would fuck with my head in a way that I'm not into,=20
at least not right now. I'm lately very interested in a quality or disqualit=
y=20
of poems that makes readers uncomfortable, even scared. But the poem still=20
has to be alive, and that does take skill, if not necessarily technical=20
skill. Skill of word by word awareness of all that juice you and I know poem=
s=20
may have. Maybe that is a technical skill, like attentiveness being a=20
technical skill, or kindness(?) -- another set of questions there. I know a=20
lot of very intelligent poets who know what it is their poems are doing, and=
=20
have a lot of interesting things to say about poetry, other peoples' poems.=20
But their poems are weaker than their ideas, essays, theories, and I find=20
myself not wanting to engage. As for S.A.M., the idea of spontaneity as=20
something to look for strikes me as passive-aggressive. I now want to say=20
that I look for poems that are as fucked up as people, but that doesn't soun=
d=20
right either. I like music. I got told that was simplistic once by a guy=20
poet, but I'm a simple person.
---------

BUCK DOWNS
hmm how about SPAM (SILENT POWERS ALL MINE)

well one person's Mystery is another's Empty Ritualism, and Elizabeth Bishop=
=20
seems about as spontaneous as Halley's Comet, I mean really. But then perhap=
s=20
she sought those things because she knew from her own poetry how they are=20
forever in short supply.

Since I don't teach and I don't learn, I feel relatively freed from the need=
=20
to be consistent or coherent in what I seek & all such as that; & indeed, if=
=20
all or most of what I got from a poem conformed to what I was "looking for",=
=20
wouldn't that be like changing socks twelve times a day for variety, &=20
shouldn't I just quit.

But I was thinking about the death of Jeff Buckley again this weekend after=20
"Mojo Pin" came up on the old shuffler. The mysterious flavor of Jeff's=20
predicament arouses me whenever I think about it, to be misunderstood so=20
thoroughly, so terminally; as though the soul of 29-year-old Freddie Mercury=
=20
woke up one morning to find itself trapped in the 45-year-old body of Bob=20
Dylan.  What a curse! to go to bed supple and sexy and powerful, and wake up=

profound and appreciated and old.

It's hard to imagine what E.B. wanted to get over in formulating her S.A.M.;=

I'm friends with spontaneity and mystery, though I'm not sure about accuracy=

It would be something like Joe Strummer's incomprehensible singing; you'd=20
have to be willing to feel it in order for it to be anything for you. This i=
s=20
similar to my feeling about drawing the three-dimensional cube: I drew that=20

Strummer's singing, and I love it anyway, and his lyrics, even though I=20
discover that I've imagined them wrong from time to time. Then I just have=20
two possibilities for the line instead of one, which is how i like to=20
approach lines anyway, at least. I've almost always had crappy radios so I=20

The hoot about this, as well as one of the bona-fides that prove my=20

song does come out. This happens most intensely when I am walking; in=20

solo leading into the second chorus of "I Love A Rainy Night" by Eddie=20
Rabbit, as thoroughly muddled and irreparable a song as could be heard on AM=
=20
radio in the last thirty years. Later, sweet relief, it was fragments of=20
"Testify" by Ronnie Wood, but as if it were sung to the tune of "Mustt Mustt=

by Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan & Party. Or sounded like that to me, who knows what=

it sounded like to anyone outside of my head. "Imagination," as Chet Baker=20

I used to be ashamed of this habit when I was a kid, because most everybody=20

QUESTION 7:
Are you living in the same geographic region of your childhood?  If so, how=20
does this affect your poetry?  If not, is that location still relevant to=20

THE ANSWERS:

ANSELM BERRIGAN
I am currently living about five blocks from where I grew up in Manhattan's=20
East Village. The fact of living here does not affect my poetry, although I=20
have noticed in considering this question that I haven't written as much her=
e=20
as I did in Brooklyn, San Francisco or Buffalo (11-12 years that period,=20
covering 1989-2000) -- but that is incidental so far, I think. The location=20
is still relevant to my poetry as a source of personal shaping, tho' the=20
neighborhood was different when I was growing up (more families, more=20
dangerous, more politicized, less expensive; somewhat kinder). I did not lik=
e=20
this area when I was 16, and I don't think that has much to do with anything=
=20
but me at that age, and our small apartment. My tendencies to like people=20
(individuals, as opposed to the species; like Swift, in a sense) and to look=

at them are highly shaped by living in this area along with being brought up=

by parents who were very open people, in a community-oriented sense. God dam=

people coming through the apt. every day. This is built into my poetry. Also=

we had a railroad apt. of four rooms for a family of four, which meant not a=

and I learned to be comfortable in my head (for privacy), and to search=20
around its edges (tho' I never would have put it that way until now), which=20
is also built into the poems, I think, or has been a constant source of=20

QUESTION 8:
How does the oral tradition fit into your poems?  And/or how not?

THE ANSWERS:

ANSELM BERRIGAN
The oral tradition, as I understand it, is built in to my writing and readin=
g=20
of poems. Basically, and most broadly, everything I write that gets shaped=20
into poetry must work aloud. That means several, at least, different things;=
=20
not all of which I can articulate at the moment. But I edit in part by=20
reading the work out loud, and it has to finally work on the page and as a=20
spoken piece of poetry for me to feel like something is done, and done well=20
enough to take outside the parameters of my own attention. I love reading=20
poems out loud, whether someone is there or not. The art of poetry as an ora=
l=20
practice is one that I feel deeply connected to -- understanding that I was=20
raised around poetry as a spoken as well as a written art. The theatrical=20
performance of poems or poetic monologues, spoken word and slam=20
poetry/poetics, rap (music and freestyle), the many types of blues music I'v=
e=20
been exposed to, certain modes of standup comedy, informal storytelling (and=
=20
I'm sure I'm leaving some things out) -- all of these have influenced my=20
listening, writing, and reading habits and practices in heavy ways. But you=20
know, anyone who pays attention to how sounds come out of their mouth is=20
interesting to me. So I take it as inherent to my work that there's an oral=20
quality I need to attend to no matter what kind of practice I'm engaged in,=20
i.e. even the most wacked out experiment or straightforward narrative has to=
=20
work sonically, with a wide range in mind, deliberately, as to what I mean b=
y=20
"work". I consider every reading to an audience a performance, even if I'm=20
just gonna stand there and read, which is generally what I do. But what the=20
voice does in conjunction with the work makes for a performance, for me, so=20=
I=20
try to work it as hard as I can to make for as good a performance as I can.=20
And I know for a fact that all I need is my poems and my voice to give=20
something to the audience, which has nothing necessarily to do with what the=
y=20
are looking for (other than a reading itself), that they can take with them.=
=20
I like to perform, I like to read poems that I have read before (they always=
=20
sound different), and I like to interact with an audience. These facts of my=
=20

The history of the oral tradition is something that I feel I will be learnin=

my entire life, as well, and that needs to be said. Much of what I know has=20
to do with the English language and certain components of African traditions=
=20
(for instance, it was very important for me to have someone explain at a=20
certain point that alliteration was more of an early basis for poetry in=20
English than rhyme  - which was imported - largely as a device to make=20
stories, poems, etc. easier to remember and pass on in a pre-writing age),=20

MYTILI JAGANNATHAN
I think the oral tradition/impulse is at the base of everything I do.  All o=
f=20
those earliest experiences of aural  meaning that are so deeply inscribed: =20
lullabies, babytalk, Sanskrit chants, Tamil songs (both traditional=20
devotionals and popular Tamil cinema songs), bilingual puns, the way=20
something in your body changes when you switch languages, nursery rhymes,=20
jump-rope rhymes . . . In terms of poetic composition, I definitely write=20
both for the ear and the eye (love that linebreak!), but the spoken/heard=20
dimension tends to come first in the sequence of my writing process.  Sound=20
captivates me and pushes me on.

Oh I think my poem is a magnetic tape of the oral tradition. Since I only=20
imagine in the technology of my time I think of the poem as a gleaming strip=

fluting human voice just the breathing and the grunts and fullblown words an=
d=20
phrases and the absence of sound of any sort, no wind hits the mirror, but=20
all of it I think is oral I think because these electronic impressions are=20
stuck on the tape by the idea of the voice as it narrates I'm sorry now the=20
technological aspect might be wrong-headed possibly digital but the gleaming=
=20
stripe seems more genital than say digital. I wonder why we are so damn fixe=
d=20
on the oral as the appropriate organ of poetry when it could be obviously as=
=20
cerebral cardiovascular and genital. it all seems related and if you want to=
=20
give it to the oral, go ahead. The oral tradition. I mean why not give it to=
=20
the ass. The mouth or the lips or the throat are just the metonymically=20
assigned organs when in fact the practice comes from all of it and seemingly=
=20
in live poetry practice only huffs out orally last, like shitting.
---------

ALICE NOTLEY
Which oral tradition do you mean?  My poems contain great sounds and tones=20
and rhythmic figures; they sound terrific when I read them.  They are meant=20
to be read on the page aloud mentally.  I am utterly influenced, in my=20
writing, by the fact that I give poetry readings.  I don't feel as if I=20
belong to any tradition in this respect except for the general tradition of=20
the performer for smallish audiences.  I am thinking a lot, at the moment,=20
about a flamenco singer named Tia Anica, who didn't begin to perform until=20
she was in her fifties.  I think I have to begin again.
---------

GIL OTT
I guess I have to turn the question around and ask: What is the "oral=20
tradition?" I usually think of it in Western terms as the mnemonic devices i=
n=20
rhyme and meter, which enabled the Greeks to remember and
pass on such epics like the Odyssey. This tradition flowered in the lyric of=
=20
the troubadours. But I actually think the "oral tradition" in contemporary=20
American poetry is more influenced by African and Caribbean
poetries/musics.

However conceived, the oral -- spoken or sung -- is essential to any poetry;=
=20
concrete poetry is really more of a visual art. Naturally, within that=20
concept are many, many divisions, thus the great diversity and richness of=20
poetry today. The big divider today seems to be "Is it for the page, or for=20
the voice?" I could say I've written both, though the very notion of=20
page-bound poetry is a fallacy. It will always be voiced, even if silently.=20
(This is an admission that I still move my lips when I read!) I could also=20
say that even when I write narrative or other prose forms, I am always aware=
=20
of the music of the words, and the rhetorical, and spiritual, power of that=20
music.

So in the end, I'd say my answer to the question is: to degrees.

FRANK SHERLOCK
I'm paraphrasing an Alan Gilbert version of the poetics of orality (from an=20
upcoming essay in FENCE), & it goes something like, "Poetry can never be=20
separated from either its utterance or reception."  Certainly not a brand-ne=
w=20
idea, but it's the latest manifestation that caught my ear. Poetry for me is=

processed in a kind of Homeric, Burnsian, B.I.G. manner. The oral tradition=20
is bona fide alive & I choose not to separate myself from it. But that's jus=

THE ANSWERS:

ANSELM BERRIGAN
After sitting and writing a letter to George W. Bush, and even sending it of=
f=20
to CA to include in this piece, I felt foul and cheap. I only want to speak=20
to the people who will be reading this, not to him -- a man of whom it has=20
been said on CNN, "Even if there was zero percent support for invading Iraq=20
the President would go forward anyway because he believes it is the right=20
thing to do." I utterly reject this man's principles and morals, and his=20
version of life; and I reject the terms of this reality that has been impose=
d=20
upon us by ages of war and greed. It represents a total failure of=20
imagination, and our consciousness, collectively, needs to be rebuilt -- a=20
practical need of the species, as a matter of fact. That is the work I am=20
interested in, beyond the immediate necessity of opposing war in all of its=20
forms. Bush is just the most current visible by-product of this failure, and=
=20
can go fuck himself.

Dear Mr. President: I am a poet, arguably the greatest since Shakespeare, an=
d=20
I am writing you today to ask if Camp David would be available for my use at=
=20
any time in the next twelve months or so.

My regular job has kept me pretty much on the hustle non-stop for the last=20
five years, and it has been hard to devote the necessary time and energy to=20
my poetry while holding up my end at work. I'd like to be able to take a=20
break for a month or so & relax & catch up on my writing. Camp David is near=
=20
my home here in D.C., & so it would be an ideal place for me to retreat for=20
say 3-5 weeks. There I would be able to concentrate on reviewing and=20
completing an initial draft of my next book of poems, to be called JONES=20
COUNTY.

I know that when you are at the presidential retreat, it is a time to=20
recharge, reflect, and return to Washington better able to fulfill your=20
duties as President. It is that kind of experience I would like to enjoy at=20
Camp David, and perhaps in some way even capture and preserve in my poetry.=20=
I=20
also know that Camp David is primarily set up to provide you and your family=
=20
the privacy they need, and I would not want to interfere with that purpose.=20
So I would be interested in making use of Camp David at any time or times of=
=20
the year when you are not actually using it.

I can drive, cook, and shop for myself, so the impact of my visit on your=20
staff could be reduced to nearly nil. I am gainfully employed, but not withi=
n=20
the precincts of academia; this means that other traditional writers=20
residencies, such as Bread Loaf or McDowell, are not available to me. I=20
believe that an opportunity to visit and create at Camp David would result i=
n=20
new poetic work for America and would reflect well on your administration's=20
affection for literature and the arts.

If you want to find out more about me, you can simply type "Buck Downs" into=

Thank you for your time, Mr. President. I look forward to hearing from you.

George W. Bush
1600 Pennsylvania Avenue
Washington   DC

7 February 2003

Mr. Bush:

First, let me point out a few things:

1) You were not a popularly-elected President. You did not gain a majority o=
f=20
votes in the 2000 election, and the only way you received a majority of=20
Electoral College votes was through the political bias of a
discredited Supreme Court.

2) Your domestic programs - policies toward the environment, women's rights,=
=20
affirmative action, worker's rights, and civil rights in general - run=20
against the grain of the American experience of the past 60 years.

3) Your disdain for the common wealth in favor of privilege is bankrupting=20
the country.

4) Your unilateralism in international affairs, and your apparent dismissal=20
of even the most moderate differences of opinion has brought the world to th=
e=20
edge of worldwide conflagration.

Pretty impressive. How do you do it? You, more than any terrorist group, hav=
e=20
benefited from the events of 9/11/01. You have shamelessly utilized that=20
tragedy as a spectacle, playing it over and over again in order to diminish=20
debate, confuse the public, and thereby cover your actions.

Mr. Bush, I believe in the future. I refuse to engage in the dialogue that=20
will shape that future by utilizing the rhetoric which you and your handlers=
=20
have created. It would be better for all of us if you would simply admit you=
r=20
failures and get out of the way.

Good bye.

Dear Mr. Bush,

How come you think that we're just a bunch of dumb hippies in the streets?=20
I'm not dumb at all. In fact, your machine paid for my Fulbright scholarship=
.=20
That's when I learned what capitalism was. When I got back from Berlin, I=20
walked out onto Times Square and the lights were so bright, I had to hide in=
=20
the public library. After I stop the war, I want to sue Nike, Pringles and=20
Cup 'O Soup for taking up space in my brain without paying rent.

But back to stupid. This is what I think is stupid. 1)Occupying an Arab=20
nation for 5-10 years and trying to build a democracy. You say you want to=20
protect Americans, but occupying Iraq is a little or a lot like colonization=
=20
and would make a great recruitment ad campaign for Osama. Meanwhile, you=20
haven't managed to send any security funds to any cities. We're all having t=
o=20
pay for our own duct tape. And anyhow, the colonizer always loses. Remember,=
=20
we used to be a colony. 2)The fact that you got to be president. I should=20
have really said this first, but I'm not in the mood to cut and paste. But=20
seriously, this is the whole problem. 3)The fact that people think I'm not=20
American because I think it's stupid that you're president. In fact, this=20
bothers me so much that at protests I've started waving an unaltered America=
n=20
flag when I yell "Drop Bush, Not Bombs." 4)Giving 30 Billion dollars a year=20
to Israel 5)Writing mandatory public school reforms and then not giving=20
states the money to implement them. There are more things that I think are=20
stupid, but I don't want to overwhelm you.

I think it's very smart that you don't teach people to read in this country.=
=20
It makes it easier for them to like you. Fox news has those great little=20
slogans, so the people don't have to read. They can just love you and hate=20
everything else.

Between the taxes and the war I've come to think you're evil incarnate.

QUESTION 1:
Doctors have invented a new implant which can be placed in the brains of
newborns to prevent all forms of suffering for a lifetime.  Is this a good
choice?  Explain your answer.

THE ANSWERS:

ANSELM BERRIGAN
No.  Is the implant some kind of life-lasting inner joint or something?  And
that seems to imply that joy and suffering can be implanted (I mean if you
can eliminate suffering you can probably double the load too, right?) --
i.e.: if some non-sufferers have some bombs dropped on their heads are they
not going to suffer?
---------

BUCK DOWNS
Steve Abbott had a questionnaire form for poets that I assume got
distributed
around to his students & they used it, because it wasn't Steve who sent it
to
Joe Brainard.  Joe did try to answer it pretty honestly even though the
questions were all not ones that applied much to the life that Joe was
living.  For example, there was a question about significant audio & all Joe
could say was I have a tape by Morrissey because so-and-so gave it to me & I
listen to it some because I have it, and a question about flying saucers
that
shows Joe to have been more or less indifferent to the phenomenon of
humanity's projection of its self-image onto foreign rocks & into strange
cans.

I never think of suffering in the way this question thinks of it.  I think
of
my sore knee, I think of my mom's bronchitis or Tom Raworth's, etc. etc. The
race of newborns and the race of doctors are both demographic fictions that
don't correlate to the life I live.  I would not trust any scientist or
medical professional who accepted the concept embodied in this question as a
principle for research; I would expect them to be a serious fuckup, and the
inventor of some high-priced piece of shit that would first magnify human
suffering to catastrophic levels before addressing it, and then failing to
address it in any significant way, and mostly leaving a big mess for
crackers
like me to have to come clean up and/or pay for.

I would be a lot more impressed if these doctors would come up with a pop to
give my mom or Tom that would undo a lifetime of cigarette smoking and life
and give them back undiminished lung capacity.  Or any other serious effort
to tackle an actual problem.

Ugh. I think this question was supposed to be a big fat softball that would
allow me to rhapsodize in a long eloquent 'statement' about the beautiful
animal man [sic] and s/her ability to transcend bad breaks & shit; sorry to
have blown it, but I don't give a fuck about 'newborns' or any other
abstracted classes of humanity at all.  Demographic abstraction is an enemy
of human contact, and human contact is all poetry has left going for it in
the media/market/culture that is its substrate.  Everything else, as Dave
Hickey once said, is advertising and term-papers.
---------

MYTILI JAGANNATHAN
I guess I disagree with the premises and assumptions of this question.
First
of all, on a very basic level, allopathic medical science has a lot to learn
about the operations of even "physical" pain, let alone emotional pain and
suffering.  I mean, just to take something widely diagnosed in the U.S. like
depression; sure, there are drugs that have been invented that do help some
people, presumably by acting on neurotransmitters, but even the details of
this process are unclear to scientists.  Also unanswered (perhaps
unanswerable) is the question of causality—-are changes in brain chemistry
the cause of depression, or does depression cause changes in brain
chemistry?
 And organic bodily processes are not simply "mechanical"—they're
informational and "intelligent," so even something like genetic engineering
is more complex than discrete and dramatic on-and-off switches.  And other
kinds of suffering:  what is suffering?  How could you catalog, much less
prevent "all forms" of it?

So that's one part of my objection.  The other part is that a lot of
suffering-as-we-know-it (which is where we begin, after all) is intricately
bound up with social/political/economic relations and our experience as part
of collective forms/structures that have powerful energies and effects
(need
I point out the previously unimaginable scope of contemporary global
capitalism?).  Of course there are biological factors that influence
physical
and psychic experiences, but such factors are always in play with
environmental conditions, in the broadest sense of "environment."  So, I
think that "suffering" is not an individual condition that can be "solved"
by
genetic/medical solutions.

I think that socially, politically, prophetically, if you like, of course
struggles for justice proceed with the "end of suffering" as a horizon, but
it's just as important how we imagine and enact those transformative
processes.  I think the processes are inherently social, material,
relational, and yes, embodied; but it's certainly not going to come about
through any top-down techno/medical Big Bang.  And creating a dynamic,
relational justice doesn't necessarily mean the end of all pain (we won't
overcome mortality, after all, we're dying all the time at the cellular
level, and extending old-age might even create as-yet-unexperienced forms of
pain, who knows?), but an end to those social structures that "freeze" or
institutionalize suffering.

I hope they invent a similar implant that would induce tolerance and respect
as well, otherwise what's to prevent the human race from turning cruel if no
other human will suffer because of the first implant?  Then our animal
friends among other species will be living worse lives than ever.  Save the
animals now!

No this is a bad choice. They would have to be adjusting it constantly which
would disturb the growing infants sense of balance. Actually I think they
have already done this and it is vaccinations and they have so much mercury
in them that kids are coming up autistic.

ALICE NOTLEY
What are 'all forms of suffering'?  How can science define them?  I wouldn't
let a scientist define what constitutes suffering -- I know you are after an
answer concerning the role of suffering in existence and whether living
would
be better if suffering were eliminated, but I can't relate to the idea of
the
scientist or doctor as the eliminator of suffering.  Or is it that you are
thinking only of disease and physical difference as forms of suffering?  I
tend to think of suffering as something caused by other humans -- I tend to
think of the other animals as beings who don't suffer unless we cause them
to
suffer or who perhaps suffer in their death throes but not much before.  If
you want to know if suffering is of value, that's a different question.  I
would prefer not to suffer and I would prefer that others not suffer even
more than I do -- to know that they do is horrible and makes me feel guilty.
But there is no 'doctor' and to even fantasize one is to miss the point:
the
doctor helps create suffering by presuming to know more about its forms than
others do.  My suffering has been of value to me partly because it has
rescued me from the doctors and their mechanistic view of reality.  But I
don't think I should have had to suffer in order to find out what I know.
---------

GIL OTT
Answering this question can only be a matter of faith, replacing a spiritual
entity with "science." I think the question is asked more playfully than
that, but I don't think there's any other way to honestly answer it. A poet
recognizes that it's one's suffering (or vulnerability) which determines
one's character - I recently read a passage in Rilke's Brigge reaffirming
this, though I can't locate the exact passage now - so the question itself
is
moot. More likely: If the suffering person could escape his suffering, would
he (which raises the nearly redundant: could he, and still be himself?)? A
point of honor among contemporary disability activists is that they would
not
accept the cure for their conditions, were one concocted. Disregarding the
inexactitude of applied science, and the concomitant sufferings it inflicts
on subjects in pursuit of cures, the question becomes one of identity.

Now ask me that question: Could science free me from the notion of identity,
would I take the cure? But then, perhaps science, or some agency, would
necessarily supply me with a reliable identity to start with.
---------

FRANK SHERLOCK
Of course this is a terrible idea! It can only lead to fascism.  Those of us
already walking the earth sans suffer block will be forced to suffer for
those who can't feel it. Camps. Torture. Entertainment.

MAGDALENA ZURAWSKI
Don't you think that a prevention from suffering would be a kind of
suffering
in itself? People with the implant would wander through a culture without
the
possibility of empathy. What an alienating feeling!! Imagine the loneliness
when listening to cowboy songs about loneliness knowing that you do not know
the loneliness they sing!! Having such an implant would probably be very
similar to watching war live on CNN. This week I saw a movie and the girl
said "I just want to feel loved" and the boy said "I just want to feel." And
it seemed to sum things up in a nutshell. I wasn't even stoned when I saw it
and I thought "I used to be the boy, but now I'm the girl." I think the
implant would keep us all on the boy's side of things. It's a terrible
place.
I'd rather be lonely than be lonely, if you know what I mean.

QUESTION 2:
There's a face of a poet on the kite you are flying over the city.  Who is
this poet?  When you reel them back from the wind what will you ask?

THE ANSWERS:

ANSELM BERRIGAN
Face of Steve Carey. Steve, how did you get here?
---------

BUCK DOWNS
well if it's my kite I must've painted drawn or ironed-on the poet's picture
since it's not likely that I'll be buying any e.g., Jack Spicer regalia, or
anything else, at Toys-R-Us anytime soon.

Was it Jack Spicer who said,

"I think that I shall never cite
 a poem as lovely as a kite?"

of course it wasn't. It was I, or actually, me.

I hope I would have the perspicacity not to reel in the kite at all, but get
it up to a way cool height & then cut the string, allowing the kite to crash
in a faraway place like Baltimore or even Glen Burnie, where a youngun would
find it & say, "did Jack Spicer run for President, or what?".
---------

MYTILI JAGANNATHAN
Interesting: the form of this question—-the delicacy, intimacy, and magical
quality of this imagined act—-makes me think of the Chilean poet and artist
Cecilia Vicuña.  She grew up in Santiago, supported Allende's participatory
socialist government, and lived in exile after Allende's murder and the long
horror of Pinochet.  "Thread" is a central figure—-both material and
symbolic—-in her poetry and installations. All of her work seems to be a
kind
of "activation": making visible and visceral the reality that we are all
connected.  It sounds so simple conceptually but it's so incredibly
powerful.
 She's done installations where she has woven threads connecting two sides
of
a street, or the opposite banks of a river, both below and above the water's
surface.  I've seen a photograph of an action she did in Bogata, Columbia,
to
protest the distribution of contaminated milk.  It was called "Vaso de
leche": she announced beforehand the time and location of her action.  At
the
appointed time, she pulled on a long piece of red yarn that was wrapped
around the a glass of milk, spilling it into the street.  Then she wrote a
poem in the street: "The cow/is the continent/whose milk (blood)/ is spilt./
What are we doing/ with life?" Cecilia says: "I look at things backwards, as
they are going to look when I am gone.  I have a very intense feeling that
what we do is already the remains of what we are doing.  The dead water, our
poems."

So this is why your fascinating image of this face on a kite, held by a
string, floating over the city, reminds me of her.  I'm not sure I can guess
what words she'd say, perhaps some new instance of her practice of poetic
etymologies emerging from what she saw across Philly, breaking words apart
"so that their internal metaphors were exposed" and new paths of meaning
revealed.  One of my favorite of these etymologies she's done:
"SOL-I-DAR-I-DAD (Give and give sun)."  What spaces, what words would she
thread together in Philadelphia?

The poet's face on my kite is Frank Samperi, reclusive when he was alive,

man's mind as pure witness, tuned to the essential deity of events, and so
endangered.

QUESTION 3:
You open a book that won't close.  Maybe you accept it?  Maybe you struggle
to close it?  Each chapter is titled INSTRUCTIONS FOR POETS.  Instead of
words a variety of strange shapes fill the pages.  The last page is blank so
you can communicate to other poets an idea you feel is vital.  The only
requirement is that you use no words, but draw a picture instead.  Describe
what you would draw.  Explain the drawing if you want, although it might be
more interesting to let us figure it out.

In the alternate universe from which this question comes and in which I can

cunt that makes the human race go cat go.

The drawing is of a human torso between the shoulders, throat area and just
below the navel.  Above the navel are several holes, small rather blurred
circles in which one can see the remnants of letters of the alphabet without
being able to make them out precisely.  An upper curve of a P or B or R for
example, but what you see looks damaged as if the letter has been roughly
pulled out.  One is not sure if there are four or five holes because one of
them is so faint.  However, it is possible to see that the holes are
bleeding.  One has the impression that a word has been ripped out of the
torso and what is left are the ghosts of letters, the ghost of a word.
---------

GIL OTT
This question is too cute. I am a poet, a writer, a word artist, and my
medium is words. Indeed, "strange shapes fill the pages" when I read, but
their articulation is verbal. In my experience, an image is a knot,
a complex made of words that is untied through a visual synapse. If I am to
continue playing this game, I will offer the image of fire, not A fire, but
the Biblical or spiritual fire, that burns everywhere and consumes nothing.

Paging through this imaginary book, I imagine myself trapped in a prism- or

the
page. Away from the map reader.

MAGDALENA ZURAWSKI
A small dot slightly left of center. It looks like a perfect dot, but with a
magnifying glass you can notice that the edges are uneven. Most importantly,
the dot is so small you can easily pass over the page and assume it is
empty.
The title of the chapter is "The definition of poetry."

QUESTION 4:
S.A.M., the three things Elizabeth Bishop believed made a satisfying poem:
Spontaneity, Accuracy, Mystery.  How does this compare with what you look
for
in a poem?  Or do you have an acronym of your own?

THE ANSWERS:

ANSELM BERRIGAN
I don't know, I haven't known how to answer this one. I'm afraid that
looking
for satisfying elements would fuck with my head in a way that I'm not into,
at least not right now. I'm lately very interested in a quality or
disquality
of poems that makes readers uncomfortable, even scared. But the poem still
has to be alive, and that does take skill, if not necessarily technical
skill. Skill of word by word awareness of all that juice you and I know
poems
may have. Maybe that is a technical skill, like attentiveness being a
technical skill, or kindness(?) -- another set of questions there. I know a
lot of very intelligent poets who know what it is their poems are doing, and
have a lot of interesting things to say about poetry, other peoples' poems.
But their poems are weaker than their ideas, essays, theories, and I find
myself not wanting to engage. As for S.A.M., the idea of spontaneity as
something to look for strikes me as passive-aggressive. I now want to say
that I look for poems that are as fucked up as people, but that doesn't
sound
right either. I like music. I got told that was simplistic once by a guy
poet, but I'm a simple person.
---------

BUCK DOWNS
hmm how about SPAM (SILENT POWERS ALL MINE)

well one person's Mystery is another's Empty Ritualism, and Elizabeth Bishop
seems about as spontaneous as Halley's Comet, I mean really. But then
perhaps
she sought those things because she knew from her own poetry how they are
forever in short supply.

Since I don't teach and I don't learn, I feel relatively freed from the need
to be consistent or coherent in what I seek & all such as that; & indeed, if
all or most of what I got from a poem conformed to what I was "looking for",
wouldn't that be like changing socks twelve times a day for variety, &
shouldn't I just quit.

But I was thinking about the death of Jeff Buckley again this weekend after
"Mojo Pin" came up on the old shuffler. The mysterious flavor of Jeff's
predicament arouses me whenever I think about it, to be misunderstood so
thoroughly, so terminally; as though the soul of 29-year-old Freddie Mercury
woke up one morning to find itself trapped in the 45-year-old body of Bob
Dylan.  What a curse! to go to bed supple and sexy and powerful, and wake up
profound and appreciated and old.

It's hard to imagine what E.B. wanted to get over in formulating her S.A.M.;
I would tend to dismiss it as cheap pedagogy. But mnemonics are for the
givers of tests and grades, and so are not of any real concern to poets and
poetry.

MYTILI JAGANNATHAN
I'm friends with spontaneity and mystery, though I'm not sure about
accuracy.
 This is the kind of question that's quite dependent on mood.  And I love

stop, I could go on forever):

Surprise
Caressing
Reverberate

Plurals
Tender
Scrappy
Capacious
Runaway
Intersecting
Potent

KEVIN KILLIAN
I'm not particular about accuracy, and spontaneity is an illusion isn't it,
the great artifice of Bishop's own poetry, which so many seem to like so
much, and that precisely introduces the element of mystery, so it seems like
a fine definition viewed at in one light.  She's so articulate, she makes me
feel like the fuzz that rises off of an old dead dandelion.

D- directness
E- engaging the world of objects & of souls
R- redirection
A- action, verb attention
I- illumination
L- liberation

MAGDALENA ZURAWSKI
I think that I probably would agree with Bishop, though I do not know what
she means exactly by "spontaneity," "accuracy" and "mystery." I only imagine
that I know what she means. I haven't read an essay or anything. When I'm at
a reading my "liking" or not "liking" is usually answered by my snide "he
ain't got no music" or "she ain't got no music." But music is more than
sound
or more accurately meaning is not separate from sound.

QUESTION 5:
All day long whenever you open your mouth a song comes out.  Maybe you get
used to it.  Maybe you want to adjust the bass or treble.  But what is this
song?  If there are lyrics, is there a particular line you want the world to
hear come out of you?

THE ANSWERS:

ANSELM BERRIGAN
It would be something like Joe Strummer's incomprehensible singing; you'd
have to be willing to feel it in order for it to be anything for you. This
is
similar to my feeling about drawing the three-dimensional cube: I drew that
because it's the only thing I can draw. I can't sing, so I relate to
Strummer's singing, and I love it anyway, and his lyrics, even though I
discover that I've imagined them wrong from time to time. Then I just have
two possibilities for the line instead of one, which is how i like to
approach lines anyway, at least. I've almost always had crappy radios so I
can't say much about bass or treble. The basis for my music has always been
incompetence of a sort, and music.
---------

BUCK DOWNS
The hoot about this, as well as one of the bona-fides that prove my
freakhood, is that this question pretty accurately describes my daily life
for the past twenty years or more. All day long whenever I open my mouth, a
song does come out. This happens most intensely when I am walking; in
converse of the old joke, it seems I must "walk and chew gum" at the same
time, or I won't get down the street. This despite the fact that my voice to
me sounds like a fifty-fifty blend of Martha Raye in her Polident years and
Lee Marvin in Paint Your Wagon.

This morning I had one of the wickedest ear-worms known to man: the guitar
solo leading into the second chorus of "I Love A Rainy Night" by Eddie
Rabbit, as thoroughly muddled and irreparable a song as could be heard on AM
radio in the last thirty years. Later, sweet relief, it was fragments of
"Testify" by Ronnie Wood, but as if it were sung to the tune of "Mustt
Mustt"
by Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan & Party. Or sounded like that to me, who knows what
it sounded like to anyone outside of my head. "Imagination," as Chet Baker
once sang, "is funny."

I used to be ashamed of this habit when I was a kid, because most everybody
who ever heard me do it either made fun of me or they put the glad hand on
me
about how I should join the chorus, the choir, the whatever; stupid pimps,
always trying to sell you a stupid job. But, you know, shame is for chumps;
and every day is another opportunity to get the fuck over it already.
---------

MYTILI JAGANNATHAN
Oh god, this actually happens to me all the time.  I have songs in my head
that I sing and that can fill me up for hours.  I can't really describe the
lyrics I sing in these moments—-maybe a few English or Tamil words in the
mix, but strangely for the most part, they're not really words in any
language that I can identify.  (I sometimes joke that it’s "fake Hindi").
It's more a matter of melodies that stick in my head and syllables that ride
across them.  A kind of folksong—something you can sing in a group—clap your
hands to—-or weep strongly to—-a simple stanzaic structure, but punchy
words/rhythm, lines ending in vowels.  Within the group singing, moments of
call-and-response, join and depart.  Sometimes the same songs recur, weeks
apart, innocently.

Mary Lou, she learned how to cope, she rides the heaven on a gyroscope, the
daily news asks her for the dope, she says, man, the dope's that there's
still hope", "I said I'm hurt. Honey, she said, let me heal it." "Man that
ain't oil that's blood," "I guess I really dug her I was too loose to
think",
"Hey bus driver keep the change, bless your children, give them names", "Let
the broken-hearted love again!!," "Did you hear that the cops finally busted
madam Marie for telling fortunes better than they do, for me this boardwalk
life's through, you ought quit this scene too." And each line comes one at a
time upon waking and grinds like a washing machine as if the words were the
window for the day. Maybe that's why there's been so much "that ain't oil,
that's blood".

QUESTION 6:
IS THIS AN EXCITING TIME FOR POETRY!?  PLEASE EXPLAIN!  THANK YOU!  (or
explain why it is not)

THE ANSWERS:

ANSELM BERRIGAN
This is an exciting time for poetry, to me. But I always think it is an
exciting time for poetry, no matter the realities present. I started writing
poems and being involved with poetry in part because of that excitement and
the fact that it felt and feels timeless and immediate at once. I do not
care
about the apparatus of publishing, or the local politics, or the attendant
map-making and map-burning that go on within poetry communities and circles
in the face of this question. Time is exciting, devastating and cruel, yes,
and there is kindness in there, and joy -- any particular time contains
these
things. Poetry allows me to see it. Not to see it better, more clearly,
etc.,
but to see it at all, I think sometimes. Time, the times, anyone's times.
Poetry is never not there, despite rampant claims otherwise, or, more to the
point, despite no claims for or against, in many places. Poetry is older
than
money, and fresher than money. And lately I am excited by and for poetry
because I do not want to see it be anything defined by "our times" or "the
times", which cannot be owned, like poetry.
---------

BUCK DOWNS
well you get the times you get
& you can get excited about it

why do I continue to remember Ms. Dabney who in 8th Grade covered an entire
blackboard with the words 'ONLY THE BORING ARE BORED' Ah well it keeps me
entertained.

As poetry's social obsolescence has become nearly complete some 100+ years
after the advent of recorded sound, I feel pretty good, freed as I am from
the tale of the tribe, unacknowledged legislation, arms and the man, and all
the rest of the pre-20th Century crap that has been foisted upon poets by
the
collected cops priests and teachers of the race, who have always resented
the
fact that poets get to talk right to god all the time, no vows, no training,
no tenure required.

The load of social relevance, poorly-borne for centuries by poets and
poetry,
has been taken up by the media, thanks, and the newspapers and their
generations of broadcast descendents have wonderfully siphoned all social
obligation out of the making of poems. The politicization of literacy has,
despite itself, been quite a helpmate too, since poets no longer have any
reason to teach anyone how to read in the wake of government monopolization
of the education industry.

So all told it seems like a great deal if you have no aspirations to boss
others around.  Poets no longer have to do any of the cultural shit-work
that
they have been forced to do for centuries in order to make their way in
society, and or but they still get to make poems, talk to god, get real
high,
& about two or three other things that make being alive so very cool to
begin
with.
---------

MYTILI JAGANNATHAN
Yes, definitely!  There's such a proliferation of kinds of poetries that
people can encounter now.  So many language traditions and evolving
practices, sonic propensities, cultural contexts, nows/thens, oral/aural,
pictorial, pixeled, parchment, palm leaf. . . And movements in many
countries
have been challenging the class/color/communal/gender lines within their
cultural spheres.  I think for people who are aware of this intense spectrum
of activity, it might also make them anxious in some way, either because of
loss of previously held power, or simply because people need sustainable
communities, and the continuity that underlies real conversations.  Of
course, global and local power imbalances on the language/culture front will
affect the way any interactions occur, but I'm interested in seeing where
these crossings take us.
---------

KEVIN KILLIAN
I'm excited.  There were a few years in the doldrums in the late 80s and
early 90s, when it seemed that everything was just being done to death, and
the people who were experimenting in prose were miles and miles ahead of the
poets (excuse me for casting this in the form of a competitive trope like
CHARIOTS OF FIRE).  And then something turned around and I began to notice
immediate, local, grass roots signs of a rebirth of poetry, here in San
Francisco at any rate.  There was a lot of excitement, stemming as usual
from
the young poets who were going to school at New College, at UC Berkeley, and
at San Francisco State, as well, of course, as a larger group without any
academic affiliation, these homogenous lumps of people suddenly met up,
collided, brokered up, reformatted, and, I think changed the nature of
poetry
here in the Bay Area.  With this new generation came a subsequent return to
status of an older, unfairly occluded and in some cases half-asleep
generation whom the new kids took as their models and teachers, Whalen,
Kyger, Clark, Berkson, not only the Bolinas bunch but a dozen others as
well.
 Someone should write a book, or better yet create a documentary that would
trace the sociological roots of this renaissance.  With Helen Mirren as Lyn
Hejinian, Ashton Kutcher as Anselm Berrigan,Casey Affleck as Adam DeGraff,
Michelle Rodriguez as Renee Gladman, Johnny Depp as Travis Ortiz, and Ian
McKellen as Philip Lamantia.

EILEEN MYLES
Well, we're in a very conservative repressive time and poetry can always get
up on its hind legs and speak and the temptation to say the wrong thing is
there, and so you can do that or not, I mean there's a lot of choices and I
say we're living in a state of active complexity, so yeah I think I have to
agree, it is an exciting time for poetry. Dive in.

I don't care if it's an exciting time for poetry or not.  Though I wonder
what it's like for the poets in Ethiopia right now.
---------

GIL OTT
The only "exciting" times for poetry are those when the art permits the
illusion of progress: either when the scales fall from my own eyes and I wr
ite, well, without obstruction, or those glorious moments when I perform and
click with the crowd. These are both personal excitements, and I think
you're
asking about the collective. There the illusion of power is magnified, but
its beauty is diluted. The community of poets grows diverse and accepting of
its diversity. This, I do believe, is happening in Philadelphia. But while a
crowd is necessary for an audience, it grows oxymoronic when applied to
poetry, which is intrinsically individual. Back to my statement about
diversity. Tolerance, cultivation, eagerness for diversity, these are the
only collective strengths of poetry. The community in Philadelphia was long
balkanized, but is putting that behind itself, and that is exciting.

FRANK SHERLOCK
This is very exciting time for poetry! More poets than ever before-more
styles. More style integration. Less Cold War leftover
new-boss-same-as-the-old-boss bunk. To the chagrin of select elders looking
for direct overthrow attempts (for relevance confirmation), today's poets
take influence & move in their own direction- albeit outside the established
framework.

This is an exciting time & an important time, particularly in the United
States. A "war without end" has begun. The American poet is much more likely
to suffer a civil liberty attack from John Ashcroft than s/he is to be
attacked from Al Qeda. The coming years promise to be even more exciting in
a
dark & vital time.

QUESTION 7:
Are you living in the same geographic region of your childhood?  If so, how
does this affect your poetry?  If not, is that location still relevant to
your poetry?

THE ANSWERS:

ANSELM BERRIGAN
I am currently living about five blocks from where I grew up in Manhattan's
East Village. The fact of living here does not affect my poetry, although I
have noticed in considering this question that I haven't written as much
here
as I did in Brooklyn, San Francisco or Buffalo (11-12 years that period,
covering 1989-2000) -- but that is incidental so far, I think. The location
is still relevant to my poetry as a source of personal shaping, tho' the
neighborhood was different when I was growing up (more families, more
dangerous, more politicized, less expensive; somewhat kinder). I did not
like
this area when I was 16, and I don't think that has much to do with anything
but me at that age, and our small apartment. My tendencies to like people
(individuals, as opposed to the species; like Swift, in a sense) and to look
at them are highly shaped by living in this area along with being brought up
by parents who were very open people, in a community-oriented sense. God
damn
people coming through the apt. every day. This is built into my poetry.
Also,
we had a railroad apt. of four rooms for a family of four, which meant not a
lot of space. Consequently I read a lot, though I might have done so anyway,
and I learned to be comfortable in my head (for privacy), and to search
around its edges (tho' I never would have put it that way until now), which
is also built into the poems, I think, or has been a constant source of
poetic incitement (is that a word?). I tend to feel incited into writing, as
opposed to inspired or agitated. This neighborhood does all of those things
to a person who spends substantial time here, however.
---------

BUCK DOWNS
I grew up in a part of the southern U.S. (Florida below Lake Okeechobee)
that
has enjoyed a rather retarded integration with the antebellum Union, Dixie,
and the reconstructed postwar States in turn, and in fact has not been
overly
friendly to human development as far back as the Micosukee. Of course, some
ten years plus after the build-through of I-75 and the expansion of
Alligator
Alley through the Everglades, the predecessor landscape has knuckled under
to
subsidized agriculture and luxury residential construction. So where I grew
up no longer exists in every relevant sense except for a resuidual taxonomy
of older roadways &c.

My people are not from there at all, but from Mississippi, specifically
Jones
County, whose slight claim to historicity [sic] is a secession against the
secession [a.k.a. THE FREE STATE OF JONES], led not by anti-slavery
ideologues or pro-Union crypto-nationalists, but by straight fucking
crackers
who saw both Feds and Confeds as rolling up to screw them over.

So whichever of these places I am from it is all about place out of place,
intuitive and rational senses of stepping out of the national or community
sync to do the necessary work of covering your own business. And the
discovery that every described place is nowhere, that it always already no
longer exists, or only exists in a fatuous dream, or only exists as a social
limit of the allowed, or only exists in "advertising and term papers", to
quote Dave Hickey (again).

MYTILI JAGANNATHAN
I've lived in Philly for the past 7 or 8 years, so no.  I grew up in West
Virginia.  It's such an interesting question for me—I haven't really thought
about the physical geography consciously  in relation to my poetry, although
I'm sure some level of influence still operates.  But I can say that one of
the most important moments for me as a poet was finding and reading Muriel
Rukeyser's stunning documentary poem, "The Book of the Dead" written in 1938
after she traveled to West Virginia to investigate the story behind the esc
alating numbers of deaths from silicosis of mine workers in Hawk's Nest and
Gauley Bridge.  It's a breathtaking poem that both exposes the complicity of
Union Carbide and its local subsidiary in the miners' deaths and registers
the landscape and people with passionate integrity.  The crazy thing is that
I never heard of this poem while I was growing up in West Virginia—I read it
for the first time in my senior year of college in Boston.  Why wasn't it
taught in every high school in the state??  But as fate would have it, I
spent the year after college back in West Virginia doing domestic violence
work in Sutton, just an hour from Hawk's Nest, where there's now a beautiful
state park.  On a trip to the park, I found a sign that mentioned the site
of
the old mine, but no mention of what happened there.  (And this was national
news in its time, Congressional investigations were held, etc.).  I think
that experience, the embodied re-experiencing  of a landscape first
encountered through a poem—-and the simultaneously visceral consciousness of
an erased history—-changed my relationship to West Virginia, gave me a
deeper
sense of locatedness, and gave me a shifted context for my own memories of
growing up there.

My strange experience of racial identity/consciousness is also strongly
shaped by the West Virginia context.  The state is something like 97% white.
I have repeated vivid childhood experiences of explaining that I was
"Indian," and being greeted with racist miming gestures/ "war cries" that
enacted TV stereotypes of Native Americans.  "Not that kind of Indian," I
would say.  But almost no one, not even adults, in my early childhood world
even knew that India was a country.  (That began to change after the movie
_Gandhi_, which came out when I was in 3rd grade).  Now I see that those
moments of "mistaken identity" forced open a different trajectory of
connection and solidarity for me.

ALICE NOTLEY
At the moment, mentally, when I write I am living in the exact same
geographic location I grew up in.  I am writing about Alma, who is god along
with various other women who are god, and the dead women, all the women who
have lived and died and anyone alive who qualifies as a dead woman.  I am a
dead woman for example.  There are also a few men among the dead women .
After an exasperating time in the first book of it, trying to vindicate the
rights of all the women who have ever lived, and then being confronted with
the sheer maleness of the War on Terror, the bombing of Afghanistan and
coming war against Iraq, the dead women have decided to relocate in a gully
in my home town.  That is a long preliminary answer.  I grew up in the
Mohave
Desert, in Needles California, and I still live there in my head at the same
time as I live in international cities.  It is a town that has been vilified
by many writers in single sentences; and Leslie Marmon Silko has burnt it
down in a novel; but I think it is the most beautiful place in the world.  I
live in the gully of dead women, behind the wrecked Rec Center, with a lot
of
burrowing owls and such.

Yes, I came up in suburban Philadelphia, and so was implanted early with a
fake rural ideal, which succumbed in adolescence to a yearning for true
intellectual community. I never found this community in the university, and
my early poetry is informed by those twin desires: idealized rural and
alienated urban. What community I subsequently discovered, and has in time
come to fill those gaps, is more international. Naturally, place is
formative
of any writing, even in suppression. In my adult years, the city proper, its
decadence and its diversity, have provided the material of my writing.

QUESTION 8:
How does the oral tradition fit into your poems?  And/or how not?

THE ANSWERS:

ANSELM BERRIGAN
The oral tradition, as I understand it, is built in to my writing and
reading
of poems. Basically, and most broadly, everything I write that gets shaped
into poetry must work aloud. That means several, at least, different things;
not all of which I can articulate at the moment. But I edit in part by
reading the work out loud, and it has to finally work on the page and as a
spoken piece of poetry for me to feel like something is done, and done well
enough to take outside the parameters of my own attention. I love reading
poems out loud, whether someone is there or not. The art of poetry as an
oral
practice is one that I feel deeply connected to -- understanding that I was
raised around poetry as a spoken as well as a written art. The theatrical
performance of poems or poetic monologues, spoken word and slam
poetry/poetics, rap (music and freestyle), the many types of blues music
I've
been exposed to, certain modes of standup comedy, informal storytelling (and
I'm sure I'm leaving some things out) -- all of these have influenced my
listening, writing, and reading habits and practices in heavy ways. But you
know, anyone who pays attention to how sounds come out of their mouth is
interesting to me. So I take it as inherent to my work that there's an oral
quality I need to attend to no matter what kind of practice I'm engaged in,
i.e. even the most wacked out experiment or straightforward narrative has to
work sonically, with a wide range in mind, deliberately, as to what I mean
by
"work". I consider every reading to an audience a performance, even if I'm
just gonna stand there and read, which is generally what I do. But what the
voice does in conjunction with the work makes for a performance, for me, so
I
try to work it as hard as I can to make for as good a performance as I can.
And I know for a fact that all I need is my poems and my voice to give
something to the audience, which has nothing necessarily to do with what
they
are looking for (other than a reading itself), that they can take with them.
I like to perform, I like to read poems that I have read before (they always
sound different), and I like to interact with an audience. These facts of my
practice are, in my way of thinking, connected to the, or an, oral
tradition.
The history of the oral tradition is something that I feel I will be
learning
my entire life, as well, and that needs to be said. Much of what I know has
to do with the English language and certain components of African traditions
(for instance, it was very important for me to have someone explain at a
certain point that alliteration was more of an early basis for poetry in
English than rhyme  - which was imported - largely as a device to make
stories, poems, etc. easier to remember and pass on in a pre-writing age),
and that is limiting (gotta work on it).
---------

BUCK DOWNS
Well I can start with the luxury of having thrown away my four previous
answers to this question to say isn't it great we are no longer hemmed in by
the limits on human achievement that reside in the "oral tradition" --

If you mean homer cavalcanti & all the pre-typewriter stuff resusciatated
and
greenhoused for the sake of Western Civilization and its curators well sure
anyone who hasn't done their homework is just a slob. But at the same time
the lost world is the lost world & I for one am in no hurry to get it back.
Orality is either an obsolete distribution channel or a skeleton key with
which one may elude the ruthless commodification and trivialization of
spiritual values that results from a print-publishing teleology, or both.
Whichever. To paraphrase Ted Berrigan, if I really believe in it, I can't
really talk about it.
---------

MYTILI JAGANNATHAN
I think the oral tradition/impulse is at the base of everything I do.  All
of
those earliest experiences of aural  meaning that are so deeply inscribed:
lullabies, babytalk, Sanskrit chants, Tamil songs (both traditional
devotionals and popular Tamil cinema songs), bilingual puns, the way
something in your body changes when you switch languages, nursery rhymes,
jump-rope rhymes . . . In terms of poetic composition, I definitely write
both for the ear and the eye (love that linebreak!), but the spoken/heard
dimension tends to come first in the sequence of my writing process.  Sound
captivates me and pushes me on.
---------

KEVIN KILLIAN
I think it's the other way round and the tradition is too big to fit into

Oh I think my poem is a magnetic tape of the oral tradition. Since I only
imagine in the technology of my time I think of the poem as a gleaming
stripe
of highly sensitive material that is somehow marked by every quiver of the
fluting human voice just the breathing and the grunts and fullblown words
and
phrases and the absence of sound of any sort, no wind hits the mirror, but
all of it I think is oral I think because these electronic impressions are
stuck on the tape by the idea of the voice as it narrates I'm sorry now the
technological aspect might be wrong-headed possibly digital but the gleaming
stripe seems more genital than say digital. I wonder why we are so damn
fixed
on the oral as the appropriate organ of poetry when it could be obviously as
cerebral cardiovascular and genital. it all seems related and if you want to
give it to the oral, go ahead. The oral tradition. I mean why not give it to
the ass. The mouth or the lips or the throat are just the metonymically
assigned organs when in fact the practice comes from all of it and seemingly
in live poetry practice only huffs out orally last, like shitting.
---------

ALICE NOTLEY
Which oral tradition do you mean?  My poems contain great sounds and tones
and rhythmic figures; they sound terrific when I read them.  They are meant
to be read on the page aloud mentally.  I am utterly influenced, in my
writing, by the fact that I give poetry readings.  I don't feel as if I
belong to any tradition in this respect except for the general tradition of
the performer for smallish audiences.  I am thinking a lot, at the moment,
about a flamenco singer named Tia Anica, who didn't begin to perform until
she was in her fifties.  I think I have to begin again.
---------

GIL OTT
I guess I have to turn the question around and ask: What is the "oral
tradition?" I usually think of it in Western terms as the mnemonic devices
in
rhyme and meter, which enabled the Greeks to remember and
pass on such epics like the Odyssey. This tradition flowered in the lyric of
the troubadours. But I actually think the "oral tradition" in contemporary
American poetry is more influenced by African and Caribbean
poetries/musics.

However conceived, the oral -- spoken or sung -- is essential to any poetry;
concrete poetry is really more of a visual art. Naturally, within that
concept are many, many divisions, thus the great diversity and richness of
poetry today. The big divider today seems to be "Is it for the page, or for
the voice?" I could say I've written both, though the very notion of
page-bound poetry is a fallacy. It will always be voiced, even if silently.
(This is an admission that I still move my lips when I read!) I could also
say that even when I write narrative or other prose forms, I am always aware
of the music of the words, and the rhetorical, and spiritual, power of that
music.

So in the end, I'd say my answer to the question is: to degrees.
---------

FRANK SHERLOCK
I'm paraphrasing an Alan Gilbert version of the poetics of orality (from an
upcoming essay in FENCE), & it goes something like, "Poetry can never be
separated from either its utterance or reception."  Certainly not a
brand-new
idea, but it's the latest manifestation that caught my ear. Poetry for me is
processed in a kind of Homeric, Burnsian, B.I.G. manner. The oral tradition
is bona fide alive & I choose not to separate myself from it. But that's
just
me. Many poet friends I know choose to hone their work in relative solitude.
To them I say godspeed & give me a holler once you're away from the desk.

QUESTION 9:
Write a letter to president George W. Bush.

THE ANSWERS:

ANSELM BERRIGAN
After sitting and writing a letter to George W. Bush, and even sending it
off
to CA to include in this piece, I felt foul and cheap. I only want to speak
to the people who will be reading this, not to him -- a man of whom it has
been said on CNN, "Even if there was zero percent support for invading Iraq
the President would go forward anyway because he believes it is the right
thing to do." I utterly reject this man's principles and morals, and his
version of life; and I reject the terms of this reality that has been
imposed
upon us by ages of war and greed. It represents a total failure of
imagination, and our consciousness, collectively, needs to be rebuilt -- a
practical need of the species, as a matter of fact. That is the work I am
interested in, beyond the immediate necessity of opposing war in all of its
forms. Bush is just the most current visible by-product of this failure, and
can go fuck himself.

Dear Mr. President: I am a poet, arguably the greatest since Shakespeare,
and
I am writing you today to ask if Camp David would be available for my use at
any time in the next twelve months or so.

My regular job has kept me pretty much on the hustle non-stop for the last
five years, and it has been hard to devote the necessary time and energy to
my poetry while holding up my end at work. I'd like to be able to take a
break for a month or so & relax & catch up on my writing. Camp David is near
my home here in D.C., & so it would be an ideal place for me to retreat for
say 3-5 weeks. There I would be able to concentrate on reviewing and
completing an initial draft of my next book of poems, to be called JONES
COUNTY.

I know that when you are at the presidential retreat, it is a time to
recharge, reflect, and return to Washington better able to fulfill your
duties as President. It is that kind of experience I would like to enjoy at
Camp David, and perhaps in some way even capture and preserve in my poetry.
I
also know that Camp David is primarily set up to provide you and your family
the privacy they need, and I would not want to interfere with that purpose.
So I would be interested in making use of Camp David at any time or times of
the year when you are not actually using it.

I can drive, cook, and shop for myself, so the impact of my visit on your
staff could be reduced to nearly nil. I am gainfully employed, but not
within
the precincts of academia; this means that other traditional writers
residencies, such as Bread Loaf or McDowell, are not available to me. I
believe that an opportunity to visit and create at Camp David would result
in
new poetic work for America and would reflect well on your administration's
affection for literature and the arts.

If you want to find out more about me, you can simply type "Buck Downs" into
Google & browse through the results. To discuss the availability of Camp
David, I can be reached at the address below.

Thank you for your time, Mr. President. I look forward to hearing from you.

Mr. Bush:

First, let me point out a few things:

1) You were not a popularly-elected President. You did not gain a majority
of
votes in the 2000 election, and the only way you received a majority of
Electoral College votes was through the political bias of a
discredited Supreme Court.

2) Your domestic programs - policies toward the environment, women's rights,
affirmative action, worker's rights, and civil rights in general - run
against the grain of the American experience of the past 60 years.

3) Your disdain for the common wealth in favor of privilege is bankrupting
the country.

4) Your unilateralism in international affairs, and your apparent dismissal
of even the most moderate differences of opinion has brought the world to
the
edge of worldwide conflagration.

Pretty impressive. How do you do it? You, more than any terrorist group,
have
benefited from the events of 9/11/01. You have shamelessly utilized that
tragedy as a spectacle, playing it over and over again in order to diminish
debate, confuse the public, and thereby cover your actions.

Mr. Bush, I believe in the future. I refuse to engage in the dialogue that
will shape that future by utilizing the rhetoric which you and your handlers
have created. It would be better for all of us if you would simply admit
your
failures and get out of the way.

Dear Mr. Bush,

How come you think that we're just a bunch of dumb hippies in the streets?
I'm not dumb at all. In fact, your machine paid for my Fulbright
scholarship.
That's when I learned what capitalism was. When I got back from Berlin, I
walked out onto Times Square and the lights were so bright, I had to hide in
the public library. After I stop the war, I want to sue Nike, Pringles and
Cup 'O Soup for taking up space in my brain without paying rent.

But back to stupid. This is what I think is stupid. 1)Occupying an Arab
nation for 5-10 years and trying to build a democracy. You say you want to
protect Americans, but occupying Iraq is a little or a lot like colonization
and would make a great recruitment ad campaign for Osama. Meanwhile, you
haven't managed to send any security funds to any cities. We're all having
to
pay for our own duct tape. And anyhow, the colonizer always loses. Remember,
we used to be a colony. 2)The fact that you got to be president. I should
have really said this first, but I'm not in the mood to cut and paste. But
seriously, this is the whole problem. 3)The fact that people think I'm not
American because I think it's stupid that you're president. In fact, this
bothers me so much that at protests I've started waving an unaltered
American
flag when I yell "Drop Bush, Not Bombs." 4)Giving 30 Billion dollars a year
to Israel 5)Writing mandatory public school reforms and then not giving
states the money to implement them. There are more things that I think are
stupid, but I don't want to overwhelm you.

I think it's very smart that you don't teach people to read in this country.
It makes it easier for them to like you. Fox news has those great little
slogans, so the people don't have to read. They can just love you and hate
everything else.

Between the taxes and the war I've come to think you're evil incarnate.

Small Press Traffic presents
Saturday, March 15, 2003 at 3:30 PM
New Experiments:
Carol Mirakove on Anxieties of Information: Intimacy & Appropriation
Talk and discussion begins at 3:30, reading at 5:00

Carol Mirakove writes: "What does information mean, anyway? We?ll look at what
it meant to Marshall McLuhan, circa 1967, and what it meant to Adilkno, circa
1998. But this is for sure: As the Internet becomes increasingly integral to
our daily realities, we encounter overwhelming access to -- and unsolicited
feeds of -- information in mass quantities. In contemporary poetry, I see
patterns of information engagement through the ostensible use of source texts,
and through a heightened consciousness of our pervasive and invasive popular
cultures (news media, advertising, art), particularly as they affect our
social and political relationships. As agents of information in a
hyper-commercialized economy, I find two chronic anxieties: (1) Is genuine
intimacy possible?, and (2) How might we serve as accurate witnesses for
people who are subject to gross injustice? I will address the presence of
these concerns in texts authored by Jackson Mac Low, Amiri Baraka, Joan
Retallack, Harryette Mullen, Carolyn Forche, Leslie Scalapino, Sianne Ngai,
Rod Smith, Heather Fuller, Elizabeth Treadwell, and Gary Sullivan; I invite
the audience to offer others. Additionally, I will touch on patterns of
information use as they are variously paralleled in the work of contemporary
musicians, such as Australian turntablists The Avalanches, Dutch indie pop
group Solex, Canadian rock composers Godspeed You Black Emperor!, and
USAmerican audio activists Ultra-red."

Mirakove will read poems from Fuck the Polis (Los Angeles, California:
1999-2001). She is the author of temporary tattoos (BabySelf Press, 2002) and
WALL (ixnay press, 1999), and is featured with Laura Elrick and Heather Fuller
in the current issue of QUID. She is a founding member of the subpress
collective, with whom she published Fractured Humorous by Edwin Torres.

<This is my first mail to this e-group.
Might call for a little self-sketch.

An Indian (write in Bengali) poet in my mid-thirties,
born and grew up in Calcutta- migrated to the US
nearly a decade back.

This anti-war poet's cry reels me back to the Bangladesh war
in the early seventies. As a seven-year old, I used to
watch the skies of a blackened city clutching onto the
window grill. A few miles from our house in Calcutta,
millions of refugees had pitched their tents. Ginsberg
spying around there one evening hatches his best anti-war
poem "September on Jessore Road".

A question to the group. I thought today's poem couldn't have
a singular topic, a subject or a mantle. How could one write an anti-war poem in the first place ? How many anti-war poems lived long as poems ?

All of Corso's poetry sound better than the "BOMB" to me.

When those nice fellas challenged my claim that journalists are either forc=
ed away from the battlefield through liability, coercion, patriotism, or fl=
at-out force, or they are identified on the battlefield as enemy targets to=
 be neutralized, when I said things have changed since someone like Michael=
 Herr collected the material that later became "Dispatches" and "Apocalypse=
 Now", when those white guys challenged my claim by disrespectfully blurtin=
g "what's your source" and "that's a lie" and "that's simply not true", the=
y were cornered morons and acting as such.  Rat-faced O'Reilly watchers.  T=
hey succeeded to force the thread of discussion away from me and the points=
 I made.

We are still losing.

Here's the guy who told me I was a liar (or something like that):

http://www.uncwil.edu/writers/Faculty/Gerard/gerard.htm

If you look at his work you'll see he's what Burroughs referred to as a "Ge=

 the sorta guy who stroke about one day being published by the Pentagon, ju=
st like Tom Clancy.  Not to get ad hominem or anything.  Heh.

>Daniel was one of a pool of journalists who had been held back from
>witnessing action the previous day, when Desert Storm's ground war had bee=
n
>launched. There, right where he was standing, 8,400 soldiers of the US
>First Infantry Division - known as the Big Red One - had attacked an
>estimated 8,000 Iraqis with 3,000 Abrams main battle tanks, Bradley
>fighting vehicles, Humvees and armoured personnel carriers.
>Daniel had seen the aftermath of modest firefights in Vietnam. "The bodies=

>had not produced a single visible body. It was a battlefield without the
>stench of urine, faeces, blood and bits of flesh. Daniel wondered what
>happened to the estimated 6,000 Iraqi defenders who had vanished. "Where
>are the bodies?" he finally asked the First Division's public affairs
>officer, an army major. "What bodies?" the major replied.
>Months later, Daniel and the world would learn why the dead had eluded
>eyewitnesses, cameras and video footage. Thousands of Iraqi soldiers, some=

>of them firing their weapons from first world war-style trenches, had been=

>buried by ploughs mounted on Abrams tanks. The tanks had flanked the lines=

>so that tons of sand from the plough spoil had funnelled into the trenches=
.
>Just behind the tanks, straddling the trench line, came Bradleys pumping
>machine-gun bullets into Iraqi troops.
>"I came through right after the lead company," said Colonel Anthony Moreno=
.
>"What you saw was a bunch of buried trenches with people's arms and legs
>sticking out of them. For all I know, we could have killed thousands."
>Two other brigades used the same tank-mounted ploughs and Bradleys to
>obliterate an estimated 70 miles of defensive trenches. They moved swiftly=
.
>The operation had been rehearsed repeatedly, weeks before, on a mile-long =

>trench line built according to satellite photographs. The finishing touche=
s
>were made by armoured combat earth-movers (ACEs). These massive bulldozers=
,
>with armoured cockpits impervious to small-arms fire, smoothed away any
>hint of the carnage. "A lot of guys were scared, but I enjoyed it," said
>PFC Joe Queen, an ACE driver awarded a Bronze Star for his performance in =

>the battle.
>What happened in the neutral zone that day is a metaphor for the art of wa=

>predictable outcome on the field of battle. In 1991 American voters rallie=
d

>Daniel, the wire service veteran, was part of the 1991 pool system. About =

>150 American journalists, photographers and film crews were scattered amon=
g
>attacking units. Their reports were supposed to be fed to a rear
>headquarters and then shared by hundreds of journalists from around the
>world. "They wouldn't let us see anything," said Daniel, who has seen just=

>about everything there is to see in war. Not a single eyewitness account, =

>photograph or strip of video of combat between 400,000 soldiers in the
>desert was produced by this battalion of professional observers.
>Most of the grisly photos from Desert Storm seen today were the work of
>independent journalists who raced to the "Highway of Death" north of
>Kuwait, where war planes had destroyed thousands of vehicles in which Iraq=
i
>soldiers had fled after the start of the ground war. The area was free of =

>the military handlers who routinely interrupted interviews to chastise
>soldiers into changing their statements while reporters stood back, or
>forcibly removed film from cameras that captured images deemed offensive b=
y
>an Army public affairs officer.
>Cheney, brimming with contempt and hostility for the press, saw journalist=
s
>as critics of the military who must be contained. "Frankly, I looked on it=

>as a problem to be managed," he said after the war. "The information
>function was extraordinarily important. I did not have a lot of confidence=

>that I could leave that to the press."
>Since being brought into government as an intern by Donald Rumsfeld, then =
a
>congressman, Cheney has spent most of his adult life fencing with the medi=
a
>and learning its strengths and weaknesses. A stunning victory in 1991 was =

>the media's agreement to permit the Pentagon to censor journalists' report=
s
>before they were printed or broadcast. In the past the Pentagon had left
>censorship up to individual reporters. During 10 years of war in Vietnam, =

>not one journalist violated self-imposed rules against reporting, for

>As a result, the conventional wisdom was that the government was not

e
>no law to abridge [. . .] freedom of the press". Only a handful of

>imposed by Bush, Cheney and Colin Powell, chairman of the joint chiefs of =

>staff. The court ruled the suit moot - the war was over - but invited the =

>press to try again so that the issue might be settled. It never was.
>The media was more duped than cowed. Cheney won over some people with the =

>promise that places in the pool would give them an advantage over
>competitors. For instance, a Washington Post pool reporter kept to himself=

>all details of a US Marine operation for exclusive use by the Post and,
>later, a book.
>For independent journalists, life was much more difficult. More than 70
>operating outside the pool system were arrested, detained, threatened at
>gunpoint or chased from the front line. Army public affairs officers made =

>nightly visits to hotels and restaurants in Hafir al Batin, a Saudi town o=
n
>the Iraqi border. Reporters and photographers would bolt from the table.
>The slower ones were arrested.
>But when the ground war started, the mighty were hamstrung along with the =

>mediocre. The Associated Press, which benefited most from a system that
>turned all journalists into wire service reporters, sent photographer Scot=
t
>Applewhite to cover victims of a Scud missile attack near Dahran. The
>warhead had hit an American tent, killing 25 army reservists and wounding =

>70. It was the single biggest loss to Saddam Hussein during Desert Storm. =

>Applewhite, an accredited pool member, was stopped by US Army military
>police. When he objected, they punched and handcuffed him while ripping th=
e
>film from his cameras.
>Cheney made sure it was just as bad for the rest of the pool. When the
>ground war started, the defence secretary declared a "media blackout",
>blocking all reports. After the war, General Norman Schwarzkopf and his
>aides revealed that the blackout was ordered because of fears that Saddam =

>would use chemical weapons on allied forces. Potential news reports of
>soldiers writhing in agony from a cloud of sarin nerve gas had spooked the=

>president and his commanders. "No pictures of that," said General Richard =

>Neal, who directed ground operations during the war.
>As a result, reports and film were delayed or "lost" by military commander=
s
>so that most of it arrived too late for most deadlines. Neal and

Whatever else this person is, he is grammatically inept and has the tin-est
of tin ears. His use of English is dreadful, as in this ignominious excerpt=
,
selected at random:

>> Anyone who has ever tried to write a story will forever after read with
deeper appreciation. I further urge students to take up the habit of art in
their own writing-- holding themselves always to a higher standard than any
teacher, editor, or reader. My goal is to instill in them a passion for
knowing.


No matter how many times I try, I still can=B9t get my mouth around "I furthe=
r
urge" and "will forever after read"! And passion for knowing WHAT??? Eh, if
I were told that I was to be taught writing by this guy I would flee in
horror.

As to the question of sources: you know how that dirty game is played,
right? Once you provide a source they will tell you it=B9s biased. And once
you provide an unbiased source they will tell you it=B9s poorly documented.
(Give a source for the source etc., ad infinitum!) And once you provide an
unbiased source that is well documented they will simply call you a commie.
You can=B9t win with these ideologues; don=B9t even try. Even the devil bowls a
strike sometimes.

Eh, if
I were told that I was to be taught writing by this guy I would flee in
horror.


Eh? Is that the formal Eh or closer to the Eeew? The Canadian Eh, or the
Tennessian Ear-horn Eh? Would you Flee in Horror or Horreur.. or would you
possible mince about rolling your eyes and giggling to yourself while
another human being tries to make their shabby, but wholly sincere point!
Fuck off Teach!

All proscriptive grammatics make me want to vomit.. If there wasnt already a
war going on
I would start one against all you English Language Hegemonics assholes..
Part of the problem with Coupling any kind of Poetics to people associated
with the professionalization and institutionalization of Natural Languages
is that they are determined to bring the fascist will of their "sense of
language" to the biological democracy of the spoken and semiotic domain..
Forgive me for stepping on any toes, but the utilization of descriptive
grammatics and/or spelling practices is far more anthropologically correct
and gives inclusion to a great deal more human expression and community. I
would rather sit and listen to 10 minutes of ill-expressed "Truckerese" or
Cockney or Pidgin, and any number of garbled variants on the King's English
than to have my tongue lassooed by the pricks and cunts of Pedagogy that so
self-righteously push their lang-snobbery.. And maybe this particular post
or particular respondent may not be the best case in point.. But this is the
exact reason why I call my work Data-Sculpure instead of Poetry.. Every inch
of this cosmos is saying something, and "error" is one of the fundamental
properties of all signal propagation..  When you figure out how the
"grammar" and "spelling" and "good ear" of genetic and social evolution all
fit together to create this world of ours then let me know, because I'd
really like to hear about it..

"To see is to retain--to behold. Elimination of all fear is in sight--which
must be aimed for....This is an age which has no symbol for death other than
the skill and bones of one stage of decomposition...and it is an age which
lives in fear of total annihilation. It is a time haunted by sexual
sterility yet almost universally incapable of perceiving the phallic nature
of every destructive manifestation of itself. It is an age which
artificially seeks to project itself materialistically into abstract space
and to fulfill itself mechanically because it has blinded itself to almost
all external reality within eyesight and to the organic awareness of even
the physical movement properties of its own perceptibility. The earliest
cave paintings discovered demonstrate that primitive man had a greater
understanding than we do that the object of fear must be objectified."

Child of the Willows
For Stan Brakhage

Frame follows frame of

   Purest flaming  prairie of

        Infuriating  earth

From shelterbelt

Saw sprockets

        At field edge

Nothing forlorn for

    acres

Across a plain colored by commerce

Whispers from the bleeding ears of

    Kansas

Crash crop of the nameable

Crowing across cowed pasture

A commodity is a sometimes thing

A house that substitutes for speech


No lacunae

In story space

Cell after painted  cell

Daily rushes of flourishing corn




Flickering poetics

Hey, I've got a request.  If you're responding to an unusually large message
to the list, would you be kind enough NOT to just send a complete copy of
the original message in your response.  Besides being unneccessary for
anyone who read the original post, it takes up a lot of space in peoples'
inboxes, sometimes causing them to become full (as it did mine today).

Your consideration is appreciated.

Dearest Lanny

Like wow dood, u kno? Wurd chill thrill, like, u kno?

Seriously, Lanny, is this the hegemony of anti-hegemony?  What I mean to say is, the Safire vs. Chomsky debate is old and too comically polarized.  This wrinkled debate can be illustrated by placing a very stoned 50 yr old ex hippie in a clasroom with his very 1950s sexually repressed grammar teacher, listening to his teacher with blood-beseiged eyes, the glint of rebellion.  Translation: it's a travesty of the issues; a person can support aspects of both positions without being religiously committed to either.  The incentive in such a contradictory position is that religious folk, even religiously anti-religious folk, are, like, you know, like, way scary, you know?  And like we don't need none of that, dig?  Weeeze got dem bloodsucking scumbags in the WHITE house already.

I think MP's point was that Gerard sucks.  Well, even in a relativist world (if we need to resort to good old puritanism), speaking as an objective subjectivist and subjective objectivist, Gerard SUCKS.  I agree.  Can we get a quorum?

I don't want to pick on you.  I just cannot help but notice your attempt to proscribe MP's supposed norms.  Is your position not the least bit absurd for your relativist/perceiver/appreciator position?  Or at the same time you reject what you perceive as MP's imagined objectivism you provide us with a fundamental property of the universe...ERROR?  Uh...please refresh my memory...what exactly IS an error?  Maybe my memory has, uh, errored-out on error.

While I would concede many of your points, I also sense you might have missed what may have been MP's point.  Philip Gerard (the alleged perpetrator of clearly shitty writing) would just as soon shove a steel spike up your ass and show his teeth through that mustachioed wound of an excuse for a mouth, all decked out in his blue oxford button down (medium starch, thank you) and khaki dockers, cell phone clipped t the webbed belt, than to actually thank you for your support.  Philip Gerard is no friend of yours.  He just wants to drink your blood, unless of course you give ol' revisionist Dana Joy-ah and his radicalist Bushies the good ol' reach-around.  Then he'll let you live long enough to let you vote.  And then stomp you into the terra.  Of course, after such an action, it might not be an objective fact that you were tread upon.

Whatever gets you through the night
It's alright It's alright It's alright,

Yeah, Edwin Torres just gave some great readings out here in FRISCO
(I'd say his range is Shakespearean if that were not taken as a pejorative
thing
by some I know on this list---so I'll just write it, in proper "hate
speech" parenthesis)...

and if you go make sure to pick up a SHOCK WORKER button....

While I rather feel you won't quite understand that I have only
ignobled this quaint* surface of inscription with an antonymic
reflectance(the ratio of reflected intensity to the incident intensity)
of very bleak and subinteresting content ie, your belief that I am
presenting "myself" through these "letters" is truly a comic
polarization, (parenthetical theatre actuates a non-plussed bo-index)
but one which is surely not subject to the Law of Malus.
And so in the spirit of the strange distractor, I would point you to
an event, and memory does not serve me, though I inhabit it now,
of a folk-tale of midieval china, of the calligrapher who was inspired
by the random argument of a princess and a porter.. Let us say you are
the princess and I the porter, and let us say that paradoxically with
my sweaty sandals and hunped back I have purposely rocked your august
palanquin(e) only that I might hold your gaze for a moment in the throng
and rush of noon-day traffic. And then your lovely voice erupts like
a crane from the crocus, your neck angles ever so subtly, your small
and embroideried breasts lilting as your mouth curses ever so
delicately.. And the calligrapher watches intently. Then sometime later
that bystander calligrapher receives his cue in the midst of his doing
and conceives a new hybrid iconicity. Perhaps, and perhaps not. Do you
feel zoos are humane? I would answer, "In a dirty pool, you gotta use
some Anglesh!" Thanks for the personal contact in a sea of performance
notices. Having Mind is not Being Mind...

I've been away from e-mail for a couple of days. Wow.

Seeing so many of his early films when I was at UWisconsin in the
1970s reinforced a lot of what I was already up to. As did hearing
him give a couple of the lectures on silent directors while visiting
a friend who went to the Art Institute of Chicago.

His talks then reminded me of Cecil Taylor's lectures in Madison: so
full of basic personal insights into the direct material nature of
the work, beautifully phrased in incredibly idiosyncratic ways to
which many people in a classroom situation didn't know how to respond.

& then more of the movies while living in Seattle including, I'm
happy to recall, some of the most recent hand-painted films a couple
of months before leaving for Texas a few years ago.

Folks on the list may be interested to know that Criterion DVDs have
a two-disc set of 26 of Brakhage's films scheduled for release in
May. (The list of films includes Mothlight, Act of Seeing with One's
Own Eyes, Water Window Baby Moving, Dog Star Man, Dante Quartet,
Desistfilm and lots more.) Criterion usually doesn't release anything
on time, but it will be good to have some things more easily
available soon.

Al-Ghazali, commentary on Internet Text:

a book of scribbles, nonsense, a book which shifts out from under you -
a contrary or wayward book, self-contrary, asking nothing -
a book to be read in any position, in any state of mind -
a book of meaningless revelations -
a book to be pronounced or mispronounced any way you like -
a book to be read once or thousands of times, or not to be read at all -
a book of any emotional states of writers and readers -
a book to be handled with purity or impurity, scarcity or excess -
a book read in murmuring, silence, politely, a book to be read out loud -
a book to be read quickly, almost in a blur or slowly at a standstill -
a book without supplication, an orderly or disorderly book -
a book without obeisance or honor, a dishonorable book -
a book any way one wants it, an irritable confusing book -
a book you can put down at any time or read through all at once -
a book whose length grows, a mumbled indistinct book -
a book of many colors and images, a perverse and impolitic book -
a vowelless and unreadable book -
an illegible book, without punctuation -
an archaic book from the future, an anachronistic book from the past -
a book of run-on sentences, words, and chapters, dissembling, unclear -
a book of diminished speech, of intensities and dissolutions -
a wavering and belittled book, a wavered and belittling book -
a book neither here nor there, neither this nor that -
a book to be dismissed, a book displaced by wandering souls -
a misinterpreted book, a book without interpretation -
a book without conceivable interpretation, a mute and blurred book -
an opaque book, a book with obstacles, a book of obstacles -
a book of generalities, an insipid and tepid book -
an unfeeling and austere book, a book without emotional response -
a book of babbling and indecipherable voices -
an unsatisfying and incomplete book, a book impossible to grasp -

Let cheering be the refusing
Beginning sit louder after I place
Her seat was the preferred bread
What such a love that Italian had for me

Did discuss father's and another
Description deny dancing distinct she there
Needing time, Fried Cement
Anything lingering more afternoon sings better

Splendid coal bribed with fruit
Little things biting did above all toys seat intuition
Dearest, the exclaiming credit still and these rubber lengths higher
Eaten abuse of merriment likely when pressured

Children describing convicts there pieces conclude
Smiling precedes opening and lighting material there
To the asking happening stays half the whole merriment
Lengths choose to leave there pieces  every afternoon

Excess is colored green though shows better red
Choose your hearing, Hearer, convicted of a little soiling
Choosing still concludes and all places whole red well fire
Sing those who wholly abuse afternoons and stay May noise

scripophily (skri-POF-uh-lee) noun

   The hobby of collecting historic stock and bond certificates.
   Also, such a collection.

[From scrip, short for subscription + -philly (love).]

  "A sought-after category right now is Confederate bonds, many of which
   were sold in Britain. Keith Hollender, a London-based scripophily
   specialist with Herzog Hollender Phillips & Co., said British clothing
   makers purchased them because they needed the American South's
   cotton."

   a hobby known as scripophily, or get an appraisal from antiques
   dealers."

We all have collected stamps or something else as children. There are
collectors for almost everything under the sun as a quick peek at eBay
would show. And there are words for these hobbies of collecting and
studying things: coins (numismatics), autographs (philography), matchbox
covers (phillumeny), you name it.

This week we'll collect some of the words to describe these pursuits.
Do you have a hobby of collecting something unusual?

Good afternoon from St. John's,

I have been charged with making up the errata slips for a 340 page
anthology. There are three errors of varying degrees of seriousness and
about 200 have already gone out to contributors and funders. Luckily, none
have gone to reviewers yet (my next task).

I have never done this before.

Any help would be appreciated.

There are two people on this list in the anthology.

Thanks,

(Gothic News Service, 3/11/03) Heritage and New American Century Seek to
Dispel Sharon Rumor

The Heritage Foundation and the group called Project for the New American
Century (PNAC) sought to dispel rumors of plans for a joint spring symposiu=
m
under the auspices of MilleniumMoveOn, a new joint umbrella organization.
According to rumors, Ariel Sharon and a group of associates have been
invited to address two subjects: "Preemptive Assassinations: Furthering the
Foundations of Civilization" and "Wall Materials and Strategies for
Protecting and Serving Indigenous Populations."
The two non-profit Foundations - both of which are considered major Think
Tanks and essential contributors to the development of Bush Administration
global policies - are said known to be developing white papers on new
administrative controls for Iraq once the planned war has achieved its
immediate military aims.
Expertise  in "Preemptive Assassinations" is considered essential to
eliminating the leadership of any internal Iraqi or outside groups that may
aggressively challenge or terrorize the military and political authority of
a United States led Occupation. Ariel Sharon=B9s example in dealing with the
Hamas and other groups in the West Bank and Gaza has apparently been
accepted by the Bush Administration and is being considered as an efficient
way - when required - to deal with both armed and unarmed civilian
opposition groups.
The interest in Israel=B9s wall building materials and strategies is also see=
n
as potentially essential in controlling potential conflicts between
conflicting national and religious groups =AD whether Kurdish, Sunni, or Shi=B9=
a
Muslim. In the case of a Balkanized Iraq, it will be considered essential
that the boundaries be under United States military control.  It=B9s rumored
that portable, sustainable walls are in development that can extend for
hundreds of miles and be well used as population containers. The walls may
also be built to contain complete surveillance and weapon needs. Their
smooth Teflon surface is impossible for civilians to slip over and is
considered grafitti resistant. Wall panels may also be conveniently unlocke=
d
to permit the passage of military and/or equipment for maintaining food
delivery and oil operations.
"This is one more flagrant example," complained officials from both
Foundations, "of the American and European left using Israel=B9s democratic
leadership and totally false - and what some may interpret as anti-Semitic
rumors -  to undercut the legitimate democratization objectives of Presiden=
t
Bush. The world is going to deeply surprised by how well we are received by
Iraqis who are innocent of the Saddam regime."
Neither the White House nor the Israeli Consultate  could not be reached fo=
r
comments on what are still considered rumors.  The Internet has no current
web site listiing for MilleniumMoveOn and there is no indication of a publi=
c
mission statement for the organization.

The following open letter just came in from my friend Saadi Yousef, the=20=

Sir, General
First, I want to say, in all honesty, that I am following what is=20

with your family, with your president, etc =85And that when I observe=20
History =96 in a differential way- I feel that I would like to be like=20=

one of my ancestors who saved a city from being razed by Tamerlane in=20
Syria.
You will enter, Sir, General, Baghdad, like all who entered, before=20
you: A conqueror=85
But you know, yourself, due to the fact that you were a conquered=20
nation once, that nations are unconquerable.
Rulers can be defeated. And our ruler will be defeated first. I am=20
happy about that, because this imbecile denied me the air of my country=20=

for more than thirty years.
You do not like Julius Caesar: You say, he was a general, but such long=20=

speeches! - So he was killed!
I, the poet, will be short instead.
You will enter Baghdad, Sir, General; can I relay to you what Omar (The=20=

second Caliph after Mohammed) advised his general who was heading for=20
Iraq?
Don=92t cut down a tree, he said.
But today things are taking a different turn; it is said that you want=20=

to cut the return route of Iraqis going back to their country. Rumor=20
has it that a list of 2000 Iraqi opponents, prepared by your Iraqi=20
agents, prohibits these Iraqis from going back to their homeland, under=20=

the pretext of easing your occupation.
In so far as this concerns me, I can=92t deny this rumor in a soft way.
"Al- Mutamar" (An Arabic weekly, financed by the American taxpayer, and=20=

based in London) has recently published a letter saying that I, the=20
poet, Saadi Yousef, must be denied the right of return to Iraq, after=20
its (liberation).
I am asking you
And Jonny Abu-Zaid, our in-coming Governor General
  To elaborate on Human Rights under the conditions of imminent
occupation.

Hello all! I am posting this to the list for my friend Matvei =
Yankelevich. Hope it's of interest! Please don not respond to me =
regarding this message, but to the email addresses mentioned =
therein.--PN

_____________________

Hello small pressers and zinesters, we need your info for Ode to Go....

With a little help from the Brooklyn Arts Council, we're launching Ode =
to Go, a public poetry project which is simultaneously a publicity =
resource for NYC small presses, journals, reading series, independent =
bookstores, and alternative literature in general.=20

The first project is Brooklyn oriented: During Nat'l Poetry Month, =
10,000 poetry coffee cups will descend upon the burrough of Brooklyn, =
channeled through bookstore cafes, espresso bars, and little silver =
morning kiosks.

These cups will have printed on them:  2 poems by 2 Brooklyn poets, and =
a web address: odetogo.com.  The curious coffee drinker will go to the =
site and find a wealth of alternatives to Barnes & Noble and Penguin =
Paperbacks (nothing personal) and -- furthermore -- right here in their =
hometown of Brooklyn.=20

The website (odetogo.com) is almost finished -- take a peak!  All that's =
left is the content... We are looking to list all the small presses and =
mags in the 5 burroughs that we can find, so send us your info right =
away, and pass this on to others in our small world.

Of course, this is a grass roots effort and we are hoping for a sign of =
your support. We understand that small presses can't give much in the =
way of money. All we're asking is a nominal contribution.  5 to 25 bucks =
for the little guys, 50 for the medium people, and 100 or more for the =
biggest of us small fish... sound fair? Just estimate the category you =
fall into.=20

We're hoping that with a few donations from our peers in the literary =
world, we can make lots more cups, distributed to all the burroughs, and =
more public poetry projects that will make you and your hard working =
press or mag more visible to your neighbors, who may at times raise =
their eyebrows at the boxes of magazines or stapled chapbooks you carry =

That's chocolate Fuji, I presume, altho the kinds with nuts (there are
usually nuts around) would also be ok.

Jerry Rothenberg asked me to forward this to the list:

=A0
For friends in New York:

We're now starting to make plans for being in New
York this autumn -- two to three months from
sometime in September to possibly the beginning of
December. To do this and to function normally (more
or less) we'll need to rent or borrow an apartment
or loft, with a preference for being in Manhattan,
where we can easily walk our way from place to
place.

If you know of anything or have any leads to
apartments that are open or people who might be
away, please pass them along to us & we can follow
up from there.

We're also going to be in New York from April 5th to
15th, mostly to participate in People's Poetry
Gathering, but housing for that is pretty much taken
care of.

Hoping to see you then but certainly in the Fall,
with warm best wishes / love / etc.

Heah, these Bush folks are really getting into old fashioned Roman modes -
unless we just want to call the invasion of Iraq a sustained drive-by
shooting. There but for poetry and neo-regal architecture - indeed there is
nothing neither innovative or poetic about the following list - but there
is, at least,  reading on, the voyeuristic pleasure and spite of reading
about  the rewards ready the imperiously game:

US firms set for postwar contracts

Danny Penman and agencies
Tuesday March 11, 2003

The American government is on the verge of awarding construction contracts
worth hundreds of millions of dollars to rebuild Iraq once Saddam Hussein i=
s
deposed.=20

Halliburton, one of the companies in the running for the deals, was headed
by the US vice-president Dick Cheney between 1995 and 2000. Halliburton has
already been awarded a lucrative contract, worth hundreds of millions of
dollars, to resurrect the Iraqi oilfields if there is a war.

Other companies have strong ties to the US administration, including the
construction giant Bechtel, the Fluor Corporation, and the Louis Berger
Group, which is presently involved in the reconstruction of Afghanistan.
Both Bechtel and the Fluor Corporation undertake construction and project
management work for the US government.

Only US companies are on the shortlist of five. The US agency for
international development (USAID) defended the narrow shortlist.

A spokeswoman said: "Because of the urgent circumstances and the unique
nature of this work, USAID will undertake a limited selection process that
expedites the review and selection of contractors for these projects."

The spokeswoman said that it was a policy of USAID to use US companies for
projects funded by the American taxpayer. Non-US companies were free,
through their governments, to organise their own business, she said.

The winning company would get about $900m (=A3563m) to repair Iraqi health
services, ports, airports, schools and other educational institutions.

Sources at the companies said the invitation was unusual in that USAID did
not ask them to set a price for defined services but rather asked them to
say what they could do for $900m. However, the winning company could expect
to make a profit of about $80m from the deal.

All five bidders have submitted their proposals or are preparing to do so
after USAID "quietly" sent out a detailed request soliciting proposals from
the likely bidders.

According to the Wall Street Journal, the Iraq reconstruction plan will
require contractors to fulfil various tasks, including reopening at least
half of the "economically important roads and bridges" - about 1,500 miles
of roadway - within 18 months.

The contractors will also be asked to repair 15% of Iraq's high-voltage
electricity grid, renovate several thousand schools and deliver 550
emergency generators within two months.

Construction industry executives said the handful of firms are competing
fiercely in part because they believe it could provide an inside track to
postwar business opportunities. The most highly sought-after prizes are oil
industry contracts.

The US government is believed to be wary of any backlash against an invasio=
n
and is preparing plans for a "hearts and minds" operation that will swing
into place as soon as the country is occupied. The government is mindful of
the longterm benefits of feeding hungry Iraqis, delivering clean water, and
paying teachers and health workers.

"It's a sensitive topic because we still haven't gone to war," one industry
executive told the Wall Street Journal. "But these companies are really in =
a
position to win something out of this geopolitical situation."

It remains unclear whether Iraqis, Americans or an international consortium
will manage the oil industry during an early post-conflict period.

Steven Schooner, a George Washington University law professor, said many
billions of dollars are at stake. He estimated that $900m would barely last
six months given the scope of the projects the administration has sketched
out.=20

"The most sophisticated firms that come in first, and establish good will
with the locals obviously will reap huge benefits down the road," said Mr
Schooner.=20

"These are going to become brand names in Iraq. That's huge."

Subject:      Turneresque by Elizabeth Willis
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; format=flowed

I read Elizabeth Willis' new book, Turneresque, this afternoon...wow!

I'm assuming the title refers to both Joseph Mallord William Turner and Ted
Turner, which is great, as we get the sort of classic "art" and the
pop-culture--but no less "art"--in one. The first section of the book is
called Modern Painters and has poems which reference or were inspired by the
more classic side of things: 18th-century French artist Jean-Siméon Chardin
and late 19th-century Scottish artist Charles Rennie Mackintosh, Baudelaire,
Rimbaud etc. (Oh, and speaking of Rimbaud, he offers the only blurb for the
book: "The world marches on! Why shouldn't it turn around?") Satisfyingly,
the poems work regardless of anyone's familiarity w/ whomever she's writing
into. There's a section called Sonnet, which is a 14 page poem, each page
functioning like a line in a sonnet. The 3rd section is called Turneresque,
and features prose poems which deal w/ diff. colorized films( I think
they're mostly films, some might be TV shows...if this were anything but a
post to a listserv I guess I'd try and find out). The 4th section is a group
of lyric poems (well, so's the whole book in a sense) and the 5th section is
the amazing poem "Drive" which was in the last issue of Hambone.

anyway, it's a really beautiful book, designed by Jeff Clark (under another
of his man-of-mystery pseudonyms). It's $10 from Burning Deck:
www.burningdeck.com


----Noah

ps:  here is a poem I wrote today after reading the book



The Untragic Hero of Epic Theater

                for Elizabeth Willis

Between ownership
& the will to call the wolves in

a child dropping an ant in oil
unfastens the blanched afternoon

Nothing changed on the road
made for mules, but then no one noticed

when the gray century was colorized
by whispers of a secret war that happens in fashions

Would you object to the shadow a helmet casts
over the need for intrigue & sleep

to the way the lights were dimmed
relaxing the audience

The subtlest lion makes
the loudest flower

& I’ve killed countless insects
planning a garden from my seat


                                       3/11/03

I suppose that win we crush those dirty iraqis we'll all give our
lovers big freedom kisses.  And tie our hair up in freedom twists,
redesign our houses and apartments with shiny new freedom casements,
set sail with a new found skill at twirling a freedom fake, plant
freedom cowslips in our victory gardens, and belt out the star-spangled
banner on shiny freedom horns.

Stan Brakhage, Avant-Garde Filmmaker, Is Dead at 70

By A. O. SCOTT


Stan Brakhage, one of the leading figures in American experimental=20
cinema, died on Sunday in Victoria, British Columbia. He was 70.

  The cause was cancer, his wife, Marilyn, said in a statement.

  In a career that in the early 1950's and continued until the last=20
weeks of his life, Mr. Brakhage made about 400 films. He also wrote=20
about film and taught extensively.

  Like the work of many artistic radicals, his is often described in=20
terms of what it is not: working in a photographic medium most commonly=20=

defined by storytelling and the reproduction of real-world objects and=20=

events, Mr. Brakhage made films that usually had no narrative, were=20
often not representational and at times even dispensed with photography=20=

altogether. With a few exceptions, his films were also made without=20
sound, which he felt might spoil the intensity of the visual experience.

  An admirer of Ezra Pound and a close associate of poets like Kenneth=20=

Rexroth, Robert Creeley and Robert Duncan, Mr. Brakhage preferred to=20
think of his films as metaphorical, abstract and highly subjective =97 =
as=20
a kind of poetry written with light.

  "He was a painter or poet in cinema," said P. Adams Sitney, a film=20
historian at Princeton University, "not a novelist like everybody else."

  Mr. Sitney continued, "In the entire history of the medium, when all=20=

the pop-culture interests have faded, a hundred years from now, he will=20=

be considered the preeminent artist of the 20th century."

  Mr. Brakhage's work is as notable for its variety as for its quantity:=20=

some of his films last only a few seconds, while others are epic in=20
scope and duration; they include meditations on sexuality and domestic=20=

life, as well as wholly abstract compositions made by scratching,=20
dyeing and otherwise altering the celluloid itself.

  In "Window Water Baby Moving" (1959) he unflinchingly documented the=20=

birth of one of his children long before camcorders became standard=20
delivery-room accessories. In "Mothlight" (1963) he sandwiched leaves,=20=

petals and insect parts between strips of perforated tape and then=20
transferred their images to film. In "The Text of Light" (1974) he=20
examined the shadings and refractions of light filtered through a heavy=20=

glass ashtray.

  But for all their differences of mood, style and formal method, Mr.=20
Brakhage's films were the expression of a singular and uncompromising=20
aesthetic program, which he articulated in numerous lectures,=20
interviews and essays.

  "Imagine an eye unruled by man-made laws of perspective," he wrote in=20=

"Metaphor on Vision," first published in the journal Film Culture in=20
1963, "an eye unprejudiced by compositional logic, an eye which does=20
not respond to the name of everything but which must know each object=20
encountered in life through an adventure of perception."

  The idea that the physical act of seeing could be separated =97=20
liberated, even =97 from the shape and nature of the things seen, and=20
from our preconceptions about them, was the basis of much of Mr.=20
Brakhage's art.

  Stan Brakhage was born Robert Sanders in a Kansas City, Mo., orphanage=20=

on Jan. 14, 1933, and adopted two weeks later by Ludwig and Clara=20
Brakhage, who named him James Stanley. He performed on radio as a boy=20
soprano, attended high school in Denver and dropped out of Dartmouth=20
after two months. In 1952 he made his first film, "Interim."

  Among his early influences were Jean Cocteau and the Italian=20
neo-realists but, after arriving in New York in 1954, he gravitated=20
toward the flourishing avant-garde film scene, drawing inspiration from=20=

artists and filmmakers like Maya Deren and Marie Menken and with Joseph=20=

Cornell, with whom he collaborated on several occasions.

  In 1957 he married Jane Collom, and the details of their lives=20
together, and the lives of their five children, would figure=20
prominently in his work. They divorced in 1987. In 1989 Mr. Brakhage=20
married Marilyn Jull, with whom he had two sons.

  He is survived by Marilyn, their sons, Anton and Vaughn; the children=20=

from his first marriage, Myrrena Schwegmann of Aurora, Colo., Crystal=20
Brakhage of Longmont, Colo., Neowyn Bartek of Denver, Bearthm Brakhage=20=

of Denver and Rarc Brakhage of Selmer, Tenn.; and 14 grandchildren.

  Mr. Brakhage's work, beginning with "Anticipation of the Night"=20
(1958), which he at one point considered ending with a scene of his own=20=

suicide, soon placed him at the center of the underground film movement.

  Jonas Mekas, a fellow filmmaker, longtime friend and director of=20
Anthology Film Archives in Manhattan, recalled on Monday that, before=20
Mr. Brakhage, "the avant-garde was very much in the classical=20
French/German tradition, and here comes this guy in his 20's from=20
Colorado with this electrifying personal style, very open and free, and=20=

that was really the beginning of the American avant-garde."

  Mr. Mekas compared Mr. Brakhage to Willem de Kooning and the other=20
Abstract Expressionist painters. In the 1980's, with "painted films"=20
like Mr. Brakhage's "Dante Quartet," this affinity would become even=20
more explicit, as though Mr. Brakhage had been able to transform the=20
implicit velocity of action painting into actual, literal movement.

  According to Marilyn Brakhage, Mr. Brakhage's doctors believed that=20
the coal-tar dyes that he used in making those films may have=20
contributed to his bladder cancer, which was diagnosed in 1996.

  Although the centers of experimental filmmaking in the 60's and 70's=20=

were San Francisco and New York, Mr. Brakhage spent much of his working=20=

life in Colorado, where he lived from 1960 until last year, when he=20
moved to Canada.

  =46rom 1969 to 1981 he taught for one semester each year at the School=20=

of the Art Institute of Chicago. (His lectures there, on his colleagues=20=

and precursors, were collected in the book "Film at Wit's End.") =46rom=20=

1981 until his retirement last year, he taught at the University of=20

  Mr. Mekas said that in his final months Mr. Brakhage was still working=20=

on film, softening the emulsion on pieces of celluloid and scratching=20

Dear Sir/Madam,

I am writing on behalf of the Poetry Library in London UK. We need to
contact Opal L Nations about permission to reproduce some of his work.
I'm hoping you will be able to provide an email or postal address at
which we can contact him about this, as his work appears in Die Young on
your website. If you are unable to do so, any other suggestions as to how
we might reach him would also be very much appreciated. Thanks for your

Mozart's Magic Flute is another super-cool Windows music game for kids =
aged 4-104. It is based on Mozart's music and turns it into interactive =
music puzzles of a kind you haven't seen before, unless you have played =
the Nutcracker Music Game, which has won a host of awards and is also =
available from the same site: www.kidmusicstage.com . I lovingly wrote =
the poetry and the entire voiceover text for both games (and invented =
much of the narrative plot).

I append a brief description of the Mozart game.

Cheers to all!

Philip Nikolayev

--------

Based on Mozart's unforgettable opera, The Magic Flute Game offers a =
one-of-a-kind, family-oriented, multigenerational experience that will =
delight kids and adults alike. Filled with dozens of fun musical games, =
puzzles, riddles and characters, the CD-ROM offering also boasts =
innovative interactive activities such as MGI's animated, rhymed =
Encyclopedia of Musical Instruments.

The Magic Flute Game features the boy Mozart, Wolfie (Mozart's true =
childhood nickname). Wolfie must use music to save the world from the =
wicked spell of the Queen of the Night. Papageno, the funny and =
whimsical bird catcher type familiar from Mozart's original opera, =
assists Wolfie and the player at every stage of the game. The Magic =
Flute helps Wolfie turn the Queen's Castle back into the lovely Princely =
Palace, saving the Prince and the Princess themselves along the way. =
Exquisite watercolor animation creates an unforgettably magical =
experience that kids as well as adults will want to relive over and =
again.

Over two dozen of all the games on the CD-ROM are based on MGI's =
proprietary Music Jigsaw Puzzle (MJP) platform. Moreover, The Magic =
Flute Game contains 24 Truly Twisted Music Riddles - another favorite =
new game type introduced by MGI. In addition to its rich "game stuff," =
the product includes an original voiced "Mozart Music Trivia"; MGI's =
"Animated Encyclopedia of Musical Instruments" with delightfully =
whimsical rhymed poems for kids by an award-winning poet Philip =
Nikolayev; Mozart's Music Box; a voiced Magic Flute tale, and an =
educational Mozart biography.

I wasn't in the class during Taylor's final, controversial semester,
but I don't think any thing like that really happened. However, he
did flunk a LOT of people that semester.

Taylor asked everyone in Intro to Black Music to create some kind of
response to a piece of music. It could be your own music, a paper, a
dance, a picture, a poem; but he had to accept it as a personal
response. This was a problem for most students who had expected a gut
class like Intro to the String Quartet, in which you take one
multiple choice listening test and got graded on a curve from B- to
B+. But, of course, because he was entirely subjective as to what
constituted a "genuine" response and hadn't accepted a huge
percentage of what was submitted, this was also a problem for the
administration, who ultimately turned the class into a pass/fail
class and passed any one who challenged their F.

"It is kind of psychotic to write poetry": an interview with the founders of
Skanky Possum
by Jessa Crispin

Perhaps "poetry magazine" isn't what you first think of when you hear the
words "Skanky Possum". "Bad punk band" might be closer. However, when Dale
Smith came across a possum stuck in a trap they set for a feral cat, the
first words out of his mouth stuck as the title of the magazine.

Smith and his wife Hoa Nguyen run the magazine and micro-publishing house
Skanky Possum out of their small Eastside Austin house. On the coffee table
are a few scattered issues of their chapbooks and a towering stack of manila
envelopes crowd their dining room table. "You see that, that's all askew?"
Hoa points at the envelopes. "That's all of the submissions from the past
couple weeks. If everybody that submitted bought a magazine, we would be
fine."

Their house holds a combination of poetry books and children's toys. Their
young son Keaton repeats words his mother says, lifting his fists over his
head and shouting, "Pom-Pom!" (a poetry magazine) and at one point,
"Poetry!" as if in victory.

The easiest way is to use the service blogrolling.com.  It will involve
putting HTML code in the template once, but after that, you use
easy-to-fill-out forms.  And you can add a "blogroll this!" button to
your browser, so if you see a blog you want on your list, you click the
button and a pop-up window comes up that you finish filling out and
VIOLA!

Okay, what if your blog isn't particularly literary most of the time,
and you're not debating the heavy issues of the time such as whether
Jane Q. Poet can properly be considered part of the L= movement? What
if, as might be the case with mine today (and it's not on the hip
"blogspot" site either), it consists entirely of the notation
"Red-bellied Woodpecker!!!"?

What if your blog, in short, is pretty damn ordinary? Quotidian?
Mundane? Etc.

Dear Sir/Madam,

I am writing on behalf of the Poetry Library in London UK. We need to
contact Opal L Nations about permission to reproduce some of his work.
I'm hoping you will be able to provide an email or postal address at
which we can contact him about this, as his work appears in Die Young on
your website. If you are unable to do so, any other suggestions as to
how
we might reach him would also be very much appreciated. Thanks for your

Nomadic Piracy: The Anti-Aesthetics of Appropriation
PAMLA Annual Convention, November 7-9, 2003
Scripts College, Claremont CA

This panel challenges the postmodern notions of appropriation, plagirism,
piracy, and/or copyright. We will be investigating texts that break
boundaries of appropriate behavior in language and borrowing and scracthing
away at the "owned" discourses. How do artists pasticha nd collage together
fragments of texts and image in order to re-produce new texts that critique
the cult of originality. We are particularly interested in papers that
explore the writing of Kathy Acker, WIlliam S. Burroughs, Raymond Federman,
Negativland, Jean-Luc Godard, and so on. Theoretical approaches informed by
Deleuze, Kristeva, Irigaray, Derrida and so on.

I think this question of Gwyn's . . . "Okay, what if your blog . . .
consists entirely of the notation "Red-bellied Woodpecker!!!"? . . .
deserves serious consideration.

In fact, I'd like to propose that anyone seeking to post to the Buffalo
Poetics list be *required* to have a blog -- such blog would be overseen by
a distinguished panel of blogsters, who would judge whether or not the said
blogger would be worthy of contributing to the list.

Criteria might include (but would not be limited to) no more than three
audio blogs in a single day, and of those, only one with maniacal laughing;
at least one reflection about poetics a month (or, you know, a year --
whatever's decided upon); and, of course, the blogger would have to include
at least one literary object that the experts determine to be an actual
*poem* -- or present evidence that he or she has read one at some point.

(Big sigh)

Honestly, this phenomenon reminds me of national health insurance. Soon all
the rich people will have blogs, and the poor will have to confine
themselves to listservs.

So, in defense of poverty, if not unacknowledged legislation, I wanted to
give some thoughts about and reactions to Charles Bernstein's statement on
poetry and politics for *Enough*. I realize it was posted two whole days
ago, so I'll quote here the parts I wanted to respond to:

***********************

"In these difficult times, let us not draw away from our poetics in an
attempt to redress the ominous possibilities of future U.S. government
policies or the onerous effects of current government policies. As poets, we
need to pursue our own forms of ethical and aesthetic response rather than
engage in the sort of pronouncement by fiat and moral presumption of
President Bush and his partisans.

[snip]

"If we are to talk of "poets" against the war, then what is it in our poems
-- as opposed to our positions as citizens -- that does the opposing?
Perhaps it might be an approach to politics, as much as to poetry, that
doesn't feel compelled to repress ambiguity or complexity nor to substitute
the righteous monologue for a skeptic's dialogue.

At these trying time we keep being hectored toward moral discourse, toward
turning our work into digestible messages. This too is a casualty of the war
machine, the undermining of the value of the projects of art, of the
aesthetic.

Art is never secondary to moral discourse but its teacher.

[snip]

"But the task for poetry is not to translate itself into the language of
social and linguistic norms but to question those norms and, indeed, to
explore the ways they are used to discipline and contain dissent.

Poetry offers not a moral compass but an aesthetic probe."

*****************************

Although I find some things here with which I can agree, I wonder about
creating a duality between morality and art, morality and aesthetics.
Morality, from the Latin mormos, custom -- of or relating to principles of
right and wrong in behavior. If we avoid morality in our art, is it to say
that we can no longer question said principles? Is the recent poetry against
the war "movement" really only a collection of hectoring moral discourse? I
haven't read the poems on the website, but I'd think that if they were,
they'd be bad poems.

In short, I don't feel we should have to run from the word "morality" --
it's right to question it, of course, especially if what's meant is some
sort of narrow and imposed state of being or acting ala Pat Robertson and
Jerry Falwell. But just because Mr. Bush likes to talk in terms of good and
evil doesn't mean, I think, that we should have to give up calling something
wrong in our poems -- or question the rightness and propriety of current
social acts.

I imagine there are still some folks on the list who have read Havelock's
*Preface to Plato* -- I quoted it a lot in a recent poem I wrote concerning
last year's World Series. The book is mostly about Homer, and how the
*Iliad* and the *Odyssey* actually served as a sort of moral encyclopedia
for the Greeks, cataloging custom and mores. Here's a section of what he
said --

"And yet the vision is not unique so much as typical. Homer did not
personally invent these ways of recollecting custom . . . he did not create
this code, nor can he alter its general color. . . the furniture in the
house may undergo some rearrangement, but there cannot be a manufacture of
new furniture."

Should that appear unpromising or as some sort of formula for dullness, I
can assure folks 30 and younger that Homer is still a pretty good read, even
if he of course pales in comparison to Homer Simpson.

Subject: 120 FBI  Agents Raid the University of Idaho (Who is next?)
From: Prof. Elizabeth Brandt from Univ. of Idaho

Well, yesterday was an exciting  day in my small town.  The FBI flew in 120
agents, fully armed in riot  gear, on two C-17 military aircraft (I think
-- they were  BIG planes) to Moscow Idaho (population 17,000 +/-) to arrest
one Saudi  graduate student for visa fraud.  The raid went down in
University  of Idaho student housing at 4:30 a.m. in the morning,
terrorizing not only  the suspect's family (he lived in student
housing with his wife and three  elementary school age children) but also
the families of neighboring students  who were awakened by the shouting and
lights and were required to remain in their homes until
after 8:30 a.m.

At least 20 other students who had the  misfortune to either know the
suspect or to have some minor immigration  irregularities were also
subjected to substantial, surprise interrogations  (4+ hours) although none
were detained or arrested yesterday.  Now, however, a witch hunt for
additional unarmed suspects who supposedly helped the guy who was arrested
is on.

The INS and FBI are working together using Gestapo tactics to question the
students -- threatening their  immigration status (and hence their
education) if they don't answer questions  which are really
aimed at the criminal investigation.  They have also  threatened their
partners and spouses with perjury charges if they don't  talk.   I spent
yesterday working with our  immigration clinic director and local criminal
defense attorneys to organize  legal representation for the students who
are being swept into the hunt for  co-conspirators.  We have reached out to
our entire area (40 -mile  radius) to find enough
attorneys.  Now I'm working on getting resources and support to them. The
Saudi government is providing financial support.

Reading about this stuff is one  thing.  Having it in your backyard is
another.  The international  students at the University of Idaho are
terrorized and  scared.

Subject: A.Word.A.Day--exonumia

exonumia (ek-suh-NOO-mee-uh, -NYOO-) noun

   Objects that resemble money but do not circulate as coin or paper money.
   For example, tokens, coupons, medal, etc.

[From New Latin exo- (outside) + num (as in numismatic: related to currency).]

  "Objects such as savings bonds, gas-ration coupons and meat- and
   butter-ration coupons are indeed collectible. ... I have seen coin
   dealers, primarily at shows, handle exonumia on these and other
   subjects."
   Don Alpert; Bond's Value Higher With Dec. 7 Stamp; The Los Angeles Times;
   Aug 11, 1988.

  "While Canada and other countries have occasionally struck wooden currency,
   wooden money is `considered distinctly an American contribution to
   exonumia' -- objects that resemble money but are not for circulation as
   money."
   Theresa Humphrey; They Take Wooden Nickels; The Sun (Baltimore, Maryland);
   Jan 27, 1993.

Blogs are free, so hey, so much for your attempt to paint us all the color of money.  and i sure as hell am not rich either.

but anyway, the debate about poets with Blogs can go on all it wants, i'll like them anyway you dice the opinions.  i think they're FANTASTIC actually, along with a lot of other things in this world concerning the internet right now.

by the way, before a friend of mine gave me her old computer, i would go to the library here in Philadelphia with the rest of the poor people and use the free terminals in there.  the internet is a beautiful thing, i'm glad i'm alive RIGHT NOW with the pulse of that cord winding out to poetry i want to get a look at.

this minor (yes?) controversy over blogs---it so resembles initial
resistance to electronic media... to every new form, means of
expression, tool, genre, medium, forum, what have you...

yes, we'll have to get off our asses to see what's happening in
blogspace---over there---*if* we want to see what's happening in
blogspace... no, i don't always feel like getting off my ass,
either... yes, that's the way it goes---blogs aren't likely to vanish
just b/c...

what matters, i think we can perhaps agree (?), is what one DOES with
same, no?... so, what to do with blogs, that can't be done here, or
that can be better done than hereabouts... but what to do with same,
in any case... i don't believe corresponding conjectures will be
necessarily obvious, not at all, not yet anyway... and for the
record, i've seen awful things done with just about every form, means
of expression, tool, etc. (and surely i can't be alone here)...

anyway, for what it's worth...

best,

Talk about overkill.
I'm really interested in this b/c it ties into
research I'm doing about the "war on terrorism." If
it's ok, I'd like to ask you a few things:
Was there any public declaration about the situation
by the government or the media?
Has the man formally been charged? Is he accused of
falsifying his own visa, or others'?

Thanks,
 Flora

oh yes, ok:  that last post of mine, as a backchan correspondent
prompts me to add, was not directed at anyone specifically, and was
not trying to unpack a retro impulse, exactly... or at least, not one
that i don't share... when i wrote

        no, i don't always feel like getting off my ass, either...

i meant to include mself in my remonstrance (if that's what it
was)... i think we need to dwell more on purpose, whether it's around
here or over there someplace... i think i need to get off *my* ass
and start a blog and see what's what (though i can't just now)... yet
i think we all need to dwell more on purpose (which is pretty clear
when we talk about the imminent war, but less clear when we discuss
poetics)...

this is assuming, i mean, we *can*, "together," dwell on anything...

best,

Hello,

If you need to be in New York this summer this is a nice place to be.  I'm
going away for the month of June and the first half of July, and am offering
my apartment for sublet.  It's a studio apartment with a separate kitchen on
the third and top floor, clean and quiet with views of well-tended gardens,
on a beautiful street in GREENPOINT, Brooklyn.  It's 2 blocks from the
subway, and I'll include use of my one-speed bike in the deal.  You can go
on the roof.  There's a computer with internet access, lots of books, and
other things.  Plant-watering required (will train).  Please email me at
nonoam@mindspring.com, or call me at (718) 389-9487

Thanks,
Noam Scheindlin

"Relief Not Bombs" Group Responds to Florida MOAB Test
(Gothic News Service, 3/12/03)

Ashington, the small Florida community next to yesterday=B9s MOAB (Massive
Ordinance Air Blast) test site on which the Air Force exploded an 18,000
pound bomb became the center of actions by a group known as the Banana
Relief Collective.  The MOAB - which is considered almost as "as good" as a=
n
atomic bomb - is designed to send a devastating wave of fire over hundreds
of yards to kill troops and civilians, flatten trees, destroy buildings and
take out significant portions of cities. These potential effects were not
lost on the shattered nerves of the Ashington community. About 20 Banana
Collective Relief members arrived in the village shortly after the bomb=B9s
detonation. Each Member =AD mostly in their twenties and early thirties - was
easily and somewhat humorously identifiable by a conical-shaped, single
banana leaf hat, carefully held together by a white and lavender pen
inscribed with the words, "Relief Not Bombs."
The Collective=B9s members =AD each standing besides shoulder-high stacks of
banana leaves on several of Ashington=B9s downtown corners =AD generously
offered to make and put hats on each of the local adults and children. In a=
n
hour=B9s time, the streets, local groceries, ice cream and coffee shops were
filled with the sight of a wave of bobbing green hats as citizens  worked t=
o
dispell MOAB=B9s intense vibrations and aftershocks. (Gothic News Services=B9
Google investigation of healing oriented web sites revealed that the banana
leaf is, in fact, alleged to absorb heat and anxiety among traumatized
populations.)

One of the most popular distribution sites was the parking lot outside the
local drugstore where the pharmacist, Dale Rogers, reported a huge run on
Kaopectate. "Incidents of diarrhea are epidemic and affect every age," he
reported. "There is also a run on tranquilizers. People are almost too
nervous to count their change. Maybe the banana leaves will work just as
good as the pills."

"We welcome the efforts of the Banana Relief Collective," a Public Health
Services Officer announced to a small gathering of reporters. Without
elaborating, he continued, "We realize a Government bomb of this size sends
all of us =AD including the Iraqis - a message. Anything this group with its
banana leaf hats can do to absorb the current epidemic of psychic
apprehension, terror and physical fear this Administration=B9s plans for war
is deeply appreciated."

Banana Relief Members =AD as is apparently their custom =AD refused to take
questions from reporters and offered no web site contact information. One
Ashington citizen, pushing back on the top of his hat cone, publicly spoke
out against the test.  "First it=B9s the election that turns Florida upside
down. I still don=B9t know if that was legal or not, but this is worse. First
we are maybe cheated, and now the President permits the Air Force to
practically drop a bomb on us. Don=B9t they have any sense of decency,
consideration or respect?"

As evening darkened, and the supply of banana leaves was exhausted,
Collective members disappeared as quietly as they arrived. No one at the
White House or Elgin Air Force Base claimed to have information on the grou=
p
or whether or not the Collective has plans to go to work in a similar manne=
r
in Iraq and Baghdad.

There were some glitches in the notifications sent from the blog so
some of you were receiving tons of repetitive emails from us... sorry.
New policy: no emails from Circulars unless it's cumulative accounts
like the following list of new stories (or if the house is on fire).

News: the site has been averaging about 2,000 hits a day, sometimes
peaking at 3,000+.  It also has a search engine.  I'll be rearranging
the categories and such things to make it more cogent.

Thanks to all of you who have appreciative emails about the site, and
apologies if some of the links and stories sent in have not made it up
in a timely fashion.

Please try to pass this email on to friends of yours who want to test
our eclectic mix of plagiarized news stories, tasteless political

Letter of Resignation by John H. Brown, Foreign Service Officer
http://www.arras.net/circulars/archives/000314.html#000314
To: Secretary of State Colin Powell
March 10, 2003
Dear Mr. Secretary:
I am joining my colleague John Brady Kiesling in submitting my
resignation from the Foreign Service (effective immediately) because I
cannot in good conscience support President Bush's war plans against
Iraq.

Charles Bernstein: Enough!
http://www.arras.net/circulars/archives/000312.html#000312
In these difficult times, let us not draw away from our poetics in an
attempt to redress the ominous possibilities of future U.S. government
policies or the onerous effects of current government policies. As
poets, we need to pursue our own forms of ethical and aesthetic
response rather than engage in the sort of pronouncement by fiat and
moral presumption of President Bush and his partisans.

Rushmore
http://www.arras.net/circulars/archives/000307.html#000307
(Gothic News Service, 3/10/03) Early Sunday morning visitors to Mount
Rushmore reported that they were astonished to find they could not look
up the 5,725-foot mountain and see the 60-foot high carved stone heads
of U.S Presidents George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Theodore
Roosevelt, and Abraham Lincoln. Instead, they found themselves looking
at a large painted portrait of President Bush hanging upside down on a
cable stretched several hundred feet between the barely exposed
foreheads of Lincoln and Washington.

Doug Rokke: Depleted Uranium, the War Against Ouselves (interview)
Traprock Peace Center
http://www.arras.net/circulars/archives/000286.html#000286
QUESTION: Any viewer who saw the war on television had the impression
this was an easy war, fought from a distance and soldiers coming back
relatively unharmed. Is this an accurate picture?
ROKKE: At the completion of the Gulf War, when we came back to the
United States in the fall of 1991, we had a total casualty count of
760: 294 dead, a little over 400 wounded or ill. But the casualty rate
now for Gulf War veterans is approximately 30 percent. Of those
stationed in the theater, including after the conflict, 221,000 have
been awarded disability, according to a Veterans Affairs (VA) report
issued September 10, 2002.


Gothic News: Burning Man Festival Site in Protest Ritual
http://www.arras.net/circulars/archives/000291.html#000291
(Gothic News Service, 3/9/03) Two Rangers at Black Rock Desert – the
annual site in Nevada for the Burning Man Festival - were greeted by a
strange vision this morning. Talking to a Reno newspaperman, one of the
Rangers reported, "It was sunrise across the playa and we were on our
first patrol. When we looked down from the perimeter ridge, we
initially saw an astonishingly large grid of either body or garbage
bags. Through our binoculars, against the rising sun, we could still
see that they were definitely filled - it could have been potatoes or
anything big and lumpy. Each bag was spaced about 30 feet away from the
next one - about 50 parallel lines going north and south, and about 40
going east and west. The whole thing made a large rectangular space,
about a mile long and a kilometer wide. Frankly I can’t say if was just
spooky, or both spooky and spectacular, to see all those black bags
begin to get the first rays of the sun."


rabble.ca: A Better Idea
[Excerpted from an article by Judy Rebick recently posted on rabble.ca,
a Canadian alternative online media source. rabble.ca has a special
anti-war coverage section as well, featuring great articles,
columnists, and events around Canada.]
from A Better Idea by Judy Rebick:
The Lysistrata Project, one of the many anti-war actions sweeping the
globe, reminds us that women’s opposition to war goes back a long way
in human history. While I am glad to see a revival of the ancient
comedy of women refusing sex to men if they go off to war, I would a
prefer a more modern version of women’s resistance. How about a story
where women form a global non-violent army and rise up against the men
in power?


USA Today's Tips for American Tourists
http://www.arras.net/circulars/
A survey in the February issue of Conde Nast Traveler states that
according to a recent Gallup poll, a declining number of Americans (54%
today vs. 79% a year ago) believes that the USA enjoys a favorable
image abroad. Further, a majority of Americans (64%) cite a fear of
unfriendliness as the top concern of traveling abroad during wartime.


Currency War
http://www.arras.net/circulars/archives/000261.html
Many analysts believe that the real reason for the upcoming US war on
Iraq is the Bush administration's goal of preventing further
Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) movement
toward the euro as an oil transaction currency standard (Iraq has
already made the switch). As long as oil is traded predominantly in US
dollars, it's easier for the US to maintain economic control over world
oil reserves.  Following are links to a number of stories on this
subject...


Joshua Clover: What Is Called Violence
http://www.arras.net/circulars/archives/000260.html#000260
[This is largely in response to Keston's Short Critique of Pacifism. I
am making a new post rather than a comment since in part I hope to use
this as a sort of informal poll on a specific question (at the end of
this post). All links open new window]
Keston's critique is a concise and articulate distillation of a long
and long-elaborated debate. I admire it for that, and I should say that
I also agree with its central beliefs. It has two lacunae worth talking
about, which I hope will lead from its abstract clarity to a pragmatic
discussion of direct action tactics.

Ginsberg and various aspects of affect and content in "political"
poetry -- in its entirety.]

difficult to communicate in any function of life, let alone a poem. It

A Mini-Anthology of Anti-War Poems
[Taken from Enough! from O Books]
http://www.arras.net/circulars/archives/000253.html#000253
Rod Smith
TED’S HEAD
So there’s this episode of Mary Tyler Moore where Ted’s trying to get a
raise & after finagling and shenaniganizing he puts one over on Lou &
gets his contract changed to non-exclusive sos he can do commercials
which is not cool WI Lou & the gang because Ted’s just a brainless gimp
& it hurts the image of the news to have the anchorman selling tomato
slicers & dogfood so Lou gets despondent because the contract can’t be
rescinded but then he gets mad & calls Ted into his office & says, you
know his voice, “You’re going to stop doing commercials, Ted” & Ted
says “why would I do that Lou?” & Lou says ‘Because if you don’t I’ll
punch your face out” & Ted says “I’ll have you arrested” & Lou says
“It’ll be too late, your face will be broken, you’re not gonna get too
many commercials with a broken face now are you Ted?” & Ted buckles
under to force & everybody loves it that Lou’s not despondent anymore
he’s back to his brustling chubby loud loveable whiskey-drinking
football-loving ways. Now imagine if Ted were Lou, if Ted were the
boss. You know how incredibly fucking brainless Ted is, but let’s
imagine he understands & is willing to use force. That’s the situation
we’re now in as Americans.


U.S. Diplomat John Brady Kiesling: Letter of Resignation
http://www.arras.net/circulars/archives/000245.html#000245
[The following is the text of John Brady Kiesling's letter of
resignation to Secretary of State Colin L. Powell. Mr. Kiesling is a
career diplomat who has served in United States embassies from Tel Aviv
to Casablanca to Yerevan.]
Dear Mr. Secretary:
I am writing you to submit my resignation from the Foreign Service of
the United States and from my position as Political Counselor in U.S.
Embassy Athens, effective March 7. I do so with a heavy heart. The
baggage of my upbringing included a felt obligation to give something
back to my country. Service as a U.S. diplomat was a dream job. I was
paid to understand foreign languages and cultures, to seek out
diplomats, politicians, scholars and journalists, and to persuade them
that U.S. interests and theirs fundamentally coincided. My faith in my
country and its values was the most powerful weapon in my diplomatic
arsenal.


Scott Pound: The Other War That's in the Works
http://www.arras.net/circulars/archives/000238.html#000238
[Scott Pound has been posting to the Buffalo Poetics List a running
diary of his time in Turkey which I will start posting here also. If I
get inspired I'll go back and pick up some of the prior ones.]
2.27.03, 13:00, Bilkent University, Ankara, Turkey
A former student of mine who recently graduated came back to campus to
see me the other day. He was making the rounds announcing his impending
marriage. Delighted for him, I said, “Congratulations! When?” He looked
down at his feet for a few seconds and when he looked back up at me all
the happiness had left his face. “I don’t know,” he said. “We will
wait.” Standing between him and married life is 8-16 months of
compulsory military service, and potentially an extended period of
conflict in the region, conflict in which he may be personally
involved. He thinks a U.S. invasion of Iraq would just be the
beginning. He’s probably right.

Charles Bernstein: Enough!
http://www.arras.net/circulars/archives/000312.html#000312
In these difficult times, let us not draw away from our poetics in an
attempt to redress the ominous possibilities of future U.S. government
policies or the onerous effects of current government policies. As poets, we
need to pursue our own forms of ethical and aesthetic response rather than
engage in the sort of pronouncement by fiat and moral presumption of
President Bush and his partisans.


UPI: Pentagon Papers Leaker Seeks Leaks on Iraq

Gothic News: New Bush Portrait Found Hanging Upside Down from Mount Rushmore
http://www.arras.net/circulars/archives/000307.html#000307
(Gothic News Service, 3/10/03) Early Sunday morning visitors to Mount
Rushmore reported that they were astonished to find they could not look up
the 5,725-foot mountain and see the 60-foot high carved stone heads of U.S
Presidents George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Theodore Roosevelt, and
Abraham Lincoln. Instead, they found themselves looking at a large painted
portrait of President Bush hanging upside down on a cable stretched several
hundred feet between the barely exposed foreheads of Lincoln and Washington.

Doug Rokke: Depleted Uranium, the War Against Ouselves (interview)
Traprock Peace Center
http://www.arras.net/circulars/archives/000286.html#000286
QUESTION: Any viewer who saw the war on television had the impression this
was an easy war, fought from a distance and soldiers coming back relatively
unharmed. Is this an accurate picture?
ROKKE: At the completion of the Gulf War, when we came back to the United
States in the fall of 1991, we had a total casualty count of 760: 294 dead,
a little over 400 wounded or ill. But the casualty rate now for Gulf War
veterans is approximately 30 percent. Of those stationed in the theater,
including after the conflict, 221,000 have been awarded disability,
according to a Veterans Affairs (VA) report issued September 10, 2002.


Gothic News: Burning Man Festival Site in Protest Ritual
http://www.arras.net/circulars/archives/000291.html#000291
(Gothic News Service, 3/9/03) Two Rangers at Black Rock Desert – the annual
site in Nevada for the Burning Man Festival - were greeted by a strange
vision this morning. Talking to a Reno newspaperman, one of the Rangers
reported, "It was sunrise across the playa and we were on our first patrol.
When we looked down from the perimeter ridge, we initially saw an
astonishingly large grid of either body or garbage bags. Through our
binoculars, against the rising sun, we could still see that they were
definitely filled - it could have been potatoes or anything big and lumpy.
Each bag was spaced about 30 feet away from the next one - about 50 parallel
lines going north and south, and about 40 going east and west. The whole
thing made a large rectangular space, about a mile long and a kilometer
wide. Frankly I can’t say if was just spooky, or both spooky and
spectacular, to see all those black bags begin to get the first rays of the
sun."

from A Better Idea by Judy Rebick:
The Lysistrata Project, one of the many anti-war actions sweeping the globe,
reminds us that women’s opposition to war goes back a long way in human
history. While I am glad to see a revival of the ancient comedy of women
refusing sex to men if they go off to war, I would a prefer a more modern
version of women’s resistance. How about a story where women form a global
non-violent army and rise up against the men in power?


USA Today's Tips for American Tourists
http://www.arras.net/circulars/
A survey in the February issue of Conde Nast Traveler states that according
to a recent Gallup poll, a declining number of Americans (54% today vs. 79%
a year ago) believes that the USA enjoys a favorable image abroad. Further,
a majority of Americans (64%) cite a fear of unfriendliness as the top
concern of traveling abroad during wartime.


Currency War
http://www.arras.net/circulars/archives/000261.html
Many analysts believe that the real reason for the upcoming US war on Iraq
is the Bush administration's goal of preventing further Organization of the
Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) movement toward the euro as an oil
transaction currency standard (Iraq has already made the switch). As long as
oil is traded predominantly in US dollars, it's easier for the US to
maintain economic control over world oil reserves.  Following are links to a
number of stories on this subject...


Joshua Clover: What Is Called Violence
http://www.arras.net/circulars/archives/000260.html#000260
[This is largely in response to Keston's Short Critique of Pacifism. I am
making a new post rather than a comment since in part I hope to use this as
a sort of informal poll on a specific question (at the end of this post).

Keston's critique is a concise and articulate distillation of a long and
long-elaborated debate. I admire it for that, and I should say that I also
agree with its central beliefs. It has two lacunae worth talking about,
which I hope will lead from its abstract clarity to a pragmatic discussion
of direct action tactics.

TED’S HEAD
So there’s this episode of Mary Tyler Moore where Ted’s trying to get a
raise & after finagling and shenaniganizing he puts one over on Lou & gets
his contract changed to non-exclusive sos he can do commercials which is not
cool WI Lou & the gang because Ted’s just a brainless gimp & it hurts the
image of the news to have the anchorman selling tomato slicers & dogfood so
Lou gets despondent because the contract can’t be rescinded but then he gets
mad & calls Ted into his office & says, you know his voice, “You’re going to
stop doing commercials, Ted” & Ted says “why would I do that Lou?” & Lou
says ‘Because if you don’t I’ll punch your face out” & Ted says “I’ll have
you arrested” & Lou says “It’ll be too late, your face will be broken, you’
re not gonna get too many commercials with a broken face now are you Ted?” &
Ted buckles under to force & everybody loves it that Lou’s not despondent
anymore he’s back to his brustling chubby loud loveable whiskey-drinking
football-loving ways. Now imagine if Ted were Lou, if Ted were the boss. You
know how incredibly fucking brainless Ted is, but let’s imagine he
understands & is willing to use force. That’s the situation we’re now in as
Americans.


U.S. Diplomat John Brady Kiesling: Letter of Resignation
http://www.arras.net/circulars/archives/000245.html#000245
[The following is the text of John Brady Kiesling's letter of resignation to
Secretary of State Colin L. Powell. Mr. Kiesling is a career diplomat who
has served in United States embassies from Tel Aviv to Casablanca to
Yerevan.]
Dear Mr. Secretary:
I am writing you to submit my resignation from the Foreign Service of the
United States and from my position as Political Counselor in U.S. Embassy
Athens, effective March 7. I do so with a heavy heart. The baggage of my
upbringing included a felt obligation to give something back to my country.
Service as a U.S. diplomat was a dream job. I was paid to understand foreign
languages and cultures, to seek out diplomats, politicians, scholars and
journalists, and to persuade them that U.S. interests and theirs
fundamentally coincided. My faith in my country and its values was the most
powerful weapon in my diplomatic arsenal.


Scott Pound: The Other War That's in the Works

[Scott Pound has been posting to the Buffalo Poetics List a running diary of
his time in Turkey which I will start posting here also. If I get inspired
I'll go back and pick up some of the prior ones.]
2.27.03, 13:00, Bilkent University, Ankara, Turkey
A former student of mine who recently graduated came back to campus to see
me the other day. He was making the rounds announcing his impending
marriage. Delighted for him, I said, “Congratulations! When?” He looked down
at his feet for a few seconds and when he looked back up at me all the
happiness had left his face. “I don’t know,” he said. “We will wait.”
Standing between him and married life is 8-16 months of compulsory military
service, and potentially an extended period of conflict in the region,
conflict in which he may be personally involved. He thinks a U.S. invasion
of Iraq would just be the beginning. He’s probably right.

About a month ago I started a weblog which I titled -fait accompli- it is at
http://nickpiombino.blogspot.com/

I do think that many writers who post frequently to the list would enjoy
Having a weblog. I was uncomfortable with the idea since, as most of you
know, I am have been a fairly regular lurker on this list, and especially
since 9/11 a fairly frequent contributor to the list, over 100 posts in the
past year or so. I felt blogging would somehow be disloyal to the list.
Actually, the two work together very well, in my opinion. There's really no
reason why the solitary blogger cannot also enjoy the public soapbox
atmosphere of the poetics list.

At the present time a weblog is free and does not take too much technical
know how, though a veteran and a great blogger, Laura, who hosts Laurable,
helped me with some of the technical things, since I am very impatient with
this kind of stuff. Probably your kid or your nephew or niece could set you
up in an hour if you want one.

The key to the effectiveness of blogging has a lot to do with Google. When
you check listings under your own name in Google you find out who has
connected with your writing instantly. When Google recently purchased Pyra
Labs, the company that hosts blogspots, this search capability was widened.
If you are seriously interested in connecting with other writers and serious
readers, blogging might be very attractive. Obviously, no single media is of
interest to everyone.

Brian Kim Stefans is a great example of someone whose blogging work is
becoming more and more exciting and important by the day. He has progressed
from having a great little print magazine -Arras- to having a web magazine,
to having a personal blog and now -Circulars-, a weblog that is getting hits
every day in the thousands ,and also offers a personal email service where
bulletins are regularly mailed to you directly. He has become an important
publisher when he can barely find the money to keep himself in tacos. On his
own, Brian is having a strong political effect and connecting with thousands
of people every day. What's not to like?

Gary Sullivan and Ron Silliman, two veteran editors and publishers were
supportive of my interest in blogging. Gary suggested I have a clear idea of
what I wanted to do. I connected this, as I often do with writing, to coming
up with a title. The name -fait accompli- occurred to me and it clicked.

I came up with the idea of continuing the work I started in my book
-Theoretical Objects- published in 1999 by Green Integer. That book was
based on my interest in the literary journal form, which I have been
interested in since the 60's. The first one I loved was that of the Italian
writer Cesare Pavese. Since I was also interested in maxims and aphorisms, I
searched for journals by writers whose maxims I began to copy out and read
and reread. One of the writers who kept popping up was Paul Valery. A spate
of unemployment in the 70's gave me a chance to read Valery's work
uninterrupted for about 6 months. Now I was intensely passionate about
journal writing and literary fragments.

Douglas Messerli, who published my first book of poems, noticed this
interest and when he started Green Integer books, a project that focuses on
literary journals, asked me for a book of my "theoretical objects." Since he
always seem to enjoy titling my books I used this phrase as the title. There
are still some copies left. (Is this considered shameless self-promotion?
Frankly, Scarlett, I don't give a damn).

When I learned about blogging soon I realized that I could pick up where
-TO- left off. My blog focuses on journal writing past and present. I have
also included letters sent to me, poems I think others might be interested
in, comments on poets, poetics, installation art and films which I like to
comment on so other people can check them out.

There is a moment to moment communicative, yet self searching and
introspective aspect that has always attracted me to journals, books of
letters, fragments and brief comments and aphoristic asides by writers. I
like the way Valery, Anais Nin, Kafka, Pavese, Andre Gide, Ned Rorem, Allen
Ginsberg, Hazlitt, William Burroughs, Marcus Aurelius, Emerson to name a few
are open and spontaneous yet self searching, even self confronting and also
express cultural observations and insights in their diaries and literary
journals, as in their essays. Another writer who has popularized this sort
of writing tremendously is Walter Benjamin in his Arcades Project. Quotation
is a big part of this sort of journal writing. Writers like Forster and
Wallace Stevens and Virgina Woolf have kept great and useful commonplace
books and diaries. There is a sense of being right there with them in the
moment far in the past that I whimsically refer to as "time travel."
Blogging seems to fit in with this all of this in a comfortable way because
blogging is geared to fragments and brief comments or essays.

You feel that you are having a personal moment with a writer in the past
when you read their journals, a similar feeling you might get in reading
blogs like those of Stephanie Young, Nada Gordon, David Hess, Kasey Silem
Mohammmad  (a writer familiar to list readers), Marianne Shaneen, Gary
Sullivan, Ron Silliman, Jordan Davis, Jonathan Mayhew, Joe Massey or Jimmy
Behrle and others. Their is a continuum from the most introspective, such as
Stephanie's or Jordan's, or that of David Hess and the most
journalistic,like Ron Silliman and Gary Sullivan. Some,like Jonathan Mayhew
provide a daily map to their thoughts about poetry. Mayhew also reads and
writes in Spanish. The amazing Heriberto Yepez, who recently read at the
Drawing Center, has two blogs, one in Spanish and one in English, and lives
in Tijuana. He links with writers all over Mexico and elsewhere. Others,
like Marianne Shaneen focus on their interests in contemporary film or
recent experimental video or the fact that this morning at 9:30 am Lytle
Shaw and Emilie Clark go before a judge for the heinous crime of posting
some photos of Iraqis on a wall littered with other posters Get all the
details right now on Marianne Shaneens blog Froth. (All these bloggers are
listed on my links at the blogspot address above of -fait accompli-.)

These bloggers, by the way, are located all over the country, so in a few
minutes of reading you have traveled to Brooklyn ,Boston, Kansas, San
Francisco,Tijuana, Mexico or elsewhere. You get local poetry news or the
weather or what the job situation is like or where you might like to give a
reading and how many people go. Jim Behrle might interview Maria Damon and
find out what she is cross-stitching these days. Or he'll interview Gabe
Gudding on his audio blog,a listee poet who has just read in Jim's reading
series in Boston. I've gotten to know so many people in one month of
blogging, just as you do when you are reading the list. But blogging seems
to encourage more letter writing back channel.

The other exciting aspect of blogging is that your can publish directly. You
don't need to wait until someone takes an interest in your ideas or thoughts
or project. The similarity with the poetics list that I like most of all is
the dailiness of it. But unlike the list, if someone wants to complain about
what you say or what you write or have written they can do it on their own
blog. There is a links section where you can recommend other blogs. Bloggers
on the whole, with a few exceptions, seem to try to avoid arrogant
confrontations, although the angry types lately seem to be sniffing around
in blogland. They don't seem to like the mostly humorous and relaxed
atmosphere of blogland. The mostly casual approach used by bloggers seems to
annoy the hell out of these angry confrontational types who want to fight or
yell about what they feel. I suggest if this is what you enjoy most, stay
here on the list or go get a good job in academia where debating and
academic controversy is considered to be part of the heart of good
scholarship. Blogging is apparently not useful for this type of activity.
People who like to argue a lot need an audience and the audience for your
blog is not immediately present like they are on the list, where you can
follow the argument and respond directly, quickly and clearly.

In summary, blogging is an indirectly interactive alternative media of great
interest to those who are bored or sick of mainstream media. But it is
useful only to those who can comfortably tolerate the views of others who
are blogging on a daily basis nearby, and who might benefit from the unique
combination of solitary writing and reading and simultaneous expanded
connections with others that this medium favors.

By the way, no two post limit!

Dear Flora:
All I can do is steer you to a March 10, 2003 _SF Chronicle_ story at

I'm sure that Prof. Brandt is extremely busy right now, but she does
teach at the U. of Idaho Law School and so shd be relatively easy to
reach. / Walter

Like eyes, closing dawn with rolling
credits feels like the birds never
sleep, but go on like water eating
the present out of crystal Syracuse
and all;  the flames are
different this morning: blocky,

impounded, like cigarettes, stinging
whips of smoke that circle the cat
stiff with warm regard. I lift night
from the streets and from the
aspiration of pavement, just so you,
worried I might accidentally shut
the alarm off on the clock, can tick

my hope off on a round nomadic pitch.
It looks like this code travelled well into
the unbearable, rebelling against a logic
that keeps those in power who have
already paid their taxes, and fail

the silky veins of transubstantiation;
or fade along the railings  like
a memory of smoke.

Sky today has ridges like muscles peeled from softer
bones that have been lying around in your eyes for
quite some time. I'm quiet, quite in my hole, wholly
immersed in waiting for those bombs to rain again.
It's my only baptism, and when I walk the streets
those who have accepted Jesus as their personal savior
know it; they can smell the desperation in my clothes,
and watch me hungily.

I wouldnt identify this as a quality specific to blogs.  You can do the
same thing with web pages, webzines, wikis, pdfs, mp3s, cds, xerox
books & zines, newsgroups,  mimeo, mailart, letterpress, graffiti,
email lists, spam  ...  I would be very wary of thinking of blogs as
all of a sudden liberating a part of the poetic consciousness which has
not had a means of distribution.  I suppose it is true that writers who
are bloggers have liberated an aspect of their own thinking about being
responsible for making their ideas available.  Im kinda reminded of the
excitement surrounding using BBSs in the late 80s were a lot of
non-digital people were focussed on a previously unknown meme.

you're right miekal, there's nothing new about the technical ability to
publish directly.  but it's the ~social reception~ of that publication form
that's important...  consumption, not production.  you & i both know the
second-class status afforded xerox publications.  although functioning in a
different arena, blogs have at least a momentary legitimacy at least in some
poetic communities...  stemming largely, i believe, from ron's adoption of

The Babel Fish translation of the German article on Lytle & Emilie:

One night on three guards As one in New York unpleasant peace activists
chicanes: Today the author Lyte Shaw and the artist Emilie Clark before
court stand The concern that American, which do not understand the
applause for the war course of the Bush government by Patriotismus,
grows. Liberty of opinion is one, but chicanery and badly provable
boycott are the other one. Today the author Lyte Shaw and the artist
Emilie Clark stand because of illegal nocturnal Plakatierens before
court. Lyte Shaw and Emilie Clark belong to a group of approximately 50
people, which stuck before the large peace demonstration on 15 February
in Manhattan photo of the everyday life life in Bagdad. The pictures
come from Paul Chan, a photographer, who was with the Iraq Peace team
from December to January in Bagdad. A goal of the poster action was,
like the two writes to show "our imminent victims simply as humans".
During the Plakatierens Shaw and Clark were placed by three policemen.
Naturally illegal Plakatieren is also in New York only one irregularity.
But although the two could prove themselves, them handcuffs were put on,
and they were shipped for the statement of their particulars on the
nearest district. Only one formality, which should take one hour. On the
district they were locked up in separate cells and had to wait two
hours, until their papers were examined. Around half two o'clock was
communicated to them in the morning that the machine for the finger
marks does not function, why they would have to be brought on another
district. There in a lengthy procedure from at least one hour the finger
marks could be finally decreased to them, whereupon they were
back-shipped again in the first district. From here the information had
to be sent to Albany and again examined. Again a formality of only one
hour of duration, after which they would get and go could
gerichtstermin, if no warrants of arrest were present against them. But
at five the two were still locked up o'clock in the morning and in
handcuffs. Finally Lyte Shaw got its gerichtstermin, but Emilie Clark,
which is more schwanger in the sieved month, was further held. Only on
insistierendes inquiring it came out that their finger marks had failed.
It was brought now, although the two protested against this treatment,
on a third police station, where it was again recognition-officially
treated. Two hours later, at seven o'clock in the morning, also it
became to finally dismiss. During the whole time the two were violently
worked on on the different police stations not to go to the peace
demonstration. First the officials that a pregnant woman woman, whom
awake they were allowed to keep and chicane the whole night is received
there a much to large risk, found to be hurt. Then they mentioned
several times that the gas Maze would be used. That is natural for a
pregnant woman woman monsters reassuring information. But intimidation
belongs in the meantime to the American everyday life. And meets
Hollywood star as would normal-bleach." WBG

They hang the man and flog the woman
That steal the goose from off the common,
But let the greater villain loose
That steals the common from the goose.

Constant apprehension of war has the same tendency
to render the head too large for the body.  A standing military
force with an overgrown executive will not long be safe.

"America is a quarter of a billion people totally misinformed and disinformed
by their government. This is tragic but our media is -- I wouldn't even say
corrupt -- it's just beyond telling us anything that the government doesn't
want us to know."

>  I U E O N N Six Features 7min, 16mm, 1994
> Director: Takahiko Iimura
>
> Combining the comical and the absurd, I created six funny faces,
> which
> were manipulated by System G (Real time texture mapping developed
> by
> Sony), to animate the visual images of Japanese vowels in Japanese
> and
> Roman alphabet. The concept is developed from Jacques Derrida's
> "Differance" in which the difference of "image," "letter" and
> "voice"
> works in space and movement. Thus six images of "AIUEONN" differ
> and
> delay with the letters and the voices, creating an example of
> multiculturalism. (T.I.)
>
> Iimura deconstructs our coherence as he shifts between the English
> Roman
> alphabet and Japanese characters, injects spoken Japanese and
> manipulates the computer images of his features. The images often
> take
> on geometrical shapes, others recall the classical images from
> Japanese
> woodcuts of a Samurai warrior grimace.-- Robert West, Curator, Mint

> Secondary Currents  16min, video, 1983
> Director: Peter Rose
>
> Secondary Currents   is a film about the relationships between

>
> Remedial Reading Comprehension 12min, 16mm, 1992
> Director: Owen Land
>
> Two kinds of material are used: 1) Material in the tradition of the
> "psycho-drama" or "personal film"; 2) Material of the sort used in
> industrial, educational, or advertising film. Questions are raised

> the necessity of using acceptably "artistic" material to make a

> art, as well as about the relationships between "personal" and
> "impersonal" works.
>
> "One of the ways that REMEDIAL READING COMPREHENSION works is in

Possible "Shock & Awe" Candlelight Procession at Washington Mall

(Gothic News, 3/13/03) A t a first time, private meeting in Washington, D.C=
.
is said to be now taking place between a group called the "Light Sculpture
Collective" and Leaders of the Peace Movement. The meeting with the artists
is to consider emergency proposals for a  "Shock & Awe" Candle Light
Procession to take place on the Capitol Moll this Sunday evening, March 16.
At the moment rumors are cyber-flying around the globe that President Bush =
=AD
unilaterally and/or with a couple of other client states =ADplans early next
week to launch devastating "Shock & Awe" attacks on Baghdad.
The Light Sculpture Collective =AD it=B9s been learned =AD is introducing an
urgent proposal to attract at least 40,000 people with "long burning"
candles for a Procession to start on the grounds below the Capitol. Monitor=
s
will align participants in columns =AD stretching from one side of the Mall t=
o
the other =AD and walk West towards the Washington Monument.  A central
phalanx =AD 5 columns wide and 160 rows deep =AD is to be "manned" by
participants who will carry 10 foot high replicas of the 800 Cruise
Missiles, the number set to be unleashed on Baghdad during the opening days
of the attack. The black fiberglass Missiles will symbolize attacks to be
made under the cover of darkness. The Missile noses are illuminated by a re=
d
LED flashing out the letters "NO".
The Procession will start at nightfall and begin with a ritual lighting of
the candles and include a bow toward Congressional Offices that Members
immediately reconsider their vote in support of the War. After walking
silently to the Washington Monument, the columns will reconfigure for a
Casting of the Light into the White House and, in particular, President
George Bush. Each Procession member is invited to walk as  close as possibl=
e
to the back of the White House and point and shake their candle toward the
President=B9s windows.
"In the manner of the President=B9s Christian faith, if 40,000 of us can get
Mister Bush to take in the accumulations of light =AD the "Shock and Awe" of
it =AD we will have at least a slim chance at reconfiguring his and the
Pentagon=B9s plans for an Iraqi slaughter," a Light Sculpture Artist is quote=
d
as saying.=20
The Procession will finish with a configuring of the 800 Cruise Missiles in
a circle of "NO" noses pointed in toward the Washington Monument.
The Meeting is expected to reach a decision by late this afternoon.

FRIDAY MARCH 14 [9:30pm]
CAVE CANEM AFRICAN-AMERICAN WRITERS GROUP READING
In 1996, poets Toi Derricotte and Cornelius Eady began a week-long summer
workshop/retreat designed to counter the under-representation and isolation
of African-American poets in writers' workshops and literary programs. From
the beginning, Cave Canem has offered a safe haven for black poets - whether
schooled in MFA programs or poetry slams - to come together to work on their
craft and engage others in critical debate.

Tonight's readers include Samiya A. Bashir, Michelle Courtney Berry, Tara
Betts, Blue, Toni Brown, Eisa Davis, Latasha Natasha Diggs, Erica Doyle,
Reggie Harris, Tonya Hegamin, Linda Susan Jackson, Tyehimba Jess, Karma
Johnson, John Keene, Toni Asante Lightfoot, Dawn Lundy Martin, Ernesto
Mercer, David Mills, G. E. Patterson, Shelagh Patterson, Carlo Paul, Cherise
Pollard, Kate Rushin, A. Van Jordan, Bakar Wilson, Ronaldo Wilson, Yolanda
Wisher, and others.

MONDAY MARCH 17 [8:00pm]
CRYSTAL WILLIAMS AND PHYLLIS WAT
A native of Detroit, Michigan, Crystal Williams' work has been published in
journals and anthologies including Ms. Magazine, Callaloo, The Indiana
Review, American Poetry: The Next Generation, and Poetry Nation among
others. She is a member of a generation of writers for whom assimilation,
invented remembrance, and cultural responsibility have become major themes.
Her first book, Kin, examines alienation, loss, and her understanding, as an
African-American woman adopted by an interracial family, of sensed
"otherness." Her second collection of poems, Lunatic, just released from
Michigan State University Press, addresses race, class, identity and desire.
One of the few contemporary performance poets who navigates the thin line
between oral and written poetries, Williams is a member of the 1995
Nuyorican Slam team and has performed her work at venues such as The Whitney
Museum of American Art, the Princeton/Columbia Club, and The National Arts
Club. Crystal Williams is Assistant Professor of Creative Writing at Reed
College in Portland, Oregon.

Phyllis Wat is the author of The Fish Soup Bowl Expedition from Ten Pell
Books and Shadow Blue from Hot Water Press. Writing on The Fish Soup Bowl
Expedition Maureen Owen applauds: "A vernacular expedition stunning as an
embroidered robe of geographies shrunk and elongated at will ... from buying
fish soup bowls in Chinatown, Manhattan to ... Tienanmen Square, Phyllis Wat
has us rowing with her as she dips her silk sleeves into the sea of
language." On sabbatical this year she has completed an as yet untitled new
manuscript. She is a founding editor of 6ix magazine (now in its twelfth
year) and has received numerous awards including a poetry grant from the
Pennsylvania Council on the Arts and a graduate poetry scholarship from
Temple University. With a bachelor's in communications/film, Wat worked in
media services and production until a stint in Beijing teaching English at
Forestry University sent her back to teaching.

WEDNESDAY MARCH 19 [8:00pm]
LEE ANN BROWN AND JACK KIMBALL
Lee Ann Brown's first full-length collection of poetry, Polyverse (Sun &
Moon Press, 1999), won the New American Poetry Series Competition and her
second book, The Sleep that Changed Everything, is forthcoming from Wesleyan
University Press this spring. She earned her BA at Brown University in 1987,
then moved to New York City where she founded Tender Buttons press which
publishes innovative writing by women. Her poetry has been published in
numerous journals and periodicals, including The Baffler, The Impercipient,
Jacket, Java, The Chicago Review, and Verse, and was recently included in
The Best American Poetry 2001 edited by Robert Hass. Lee Ann Brown performs
her work internationally and works in film, video and song. She has taught
at several universities in the United States including Barnard College, Bard
College's Institute for Writing and Thinking, Naropa University, and
Columbia University's Summer Writing Program. She is currently Assistant
Professor of English at St. John's University and part of the visiting
faculty at New School University's MFA Program.

During the 1990s Jack Kimball lived in Japan where he initiated several web
projects, including Video Tokyo and The East Village. In 2000 he returned to
Boston to teach and start Faux Press. His recent books of poetry include
Manship, Frosted, Nitric Oxide, and Witness Protection. A book of his short
essays on poetry is due next year. Forest Gander writes: "Jack Kimball's
poems are distillations, precisely juxtaposed and wildly errant, inventing
the very syntax as they go."

Hi,

two things.

1) did my errata request not make it through?

2) I will be going into a high school next friday (World Poetry Domination
   Day) to do one of my Exploding Language Poetry Workshops. Would anyone
   be interested in doing some sort of exchange? I'm going to have 15
   students for three hours. The last section of this is reserved for some
   sort of public reading. I don't know what I'm thinking but if you would
   like to hook something up with me and some kids at a high school in the
   eastern most city in North America ( a school where the gym became home
   to some of the thousands of airline travelers stranded here because of
   9/11), let me know.

cheers,
kevin

MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="iso-8859-1"

It's always a pleasure to read Nick Pimobino's balanced and graceful prose.
Nick, were you ever influenced by Samuel Johnson? I just might have to go
read your blog.

Nevertheless, there are a few things in his eloquent defense of weblogs with
which I'd respectfully disagree.

"There's really no reason why the solitary blogger cannot also enjoy the
public soapbox atmosphere of the poetics list."

--- None at all, but I wasn't speaking from the perspective of the blogger,
but from that of the "consumer" of such poetic information, for whom
one-stop shopping at a listserv would save a lot of valuable time during the
day.

"At the present time a weblog is free"

--- It did distress me that the metaphorical nature of my original post
wasn't discerned. I know blogs are free. I was speaking of the insurance
market, whose original premise was that bands of consumers could unite and
lower the price (the idea behind single-payer in Canada). Individualistic
and, yes, wealthy Americans who want to "choose their own doctor" have
resisted such an idea in the United States. I was comparing the explosion of
blogs to private insurance -- or, to use a more poetic term, Blake's Ulro, a
world of individualistic egos, from which single-vision and Newton's sleep
may God us keep.

"The key to the effectiveness of blogging has a lot to do with Google. When
you check listings under your own name in Google you find out who has
connected with your writing instantly. . . . If you are seriously interested
in connecting with other writers and serious readers, blogging might be very
attractive."

--- If I posted to a list the size of the poetics list, and people responded
to my post either on the list or back-channel, would I also not know who
they were?

Brian Kim Stefans is a great example of someone whose blogging work is
becoming more and more exciting and important by the day. . . . On his own,
Brian is having a strong political effect and connecting with thousands of
people every day. What's not to like?

--- I absolutely agree, and applaud Brian for his *Circulars* site. Still, I
don't see it as his personal blog; he actually contributes very little to
it. In fact, it's more of a (dare I say it?) listserv, in that it features
many different points of view and opinions and the opportunity to respond to
them. It's on my Favorites menu . . .

"Now I was intensely passionate about journal writing and literary
fragments. . . . Douglas Messerli, who published my first book of poems,
noticed this interest and when he started Green Integer books, a project
that focuses on literary journals, asked me for a book . . ."

--- Thanks for the tip! Most of my own writing projects start from journals,
so I'll contact Doug and see if he's accepting submissions . . .

(Nick goes on to state what he likes about journals, all of which I agree
with. He mentions the "open and spontaneous, yet self-searching" nature of
the form, and goes on to say "There is a sense of being right there with
them in the moment." To my mind -- and taste -- there's no higher praise.
And again, I don't want to seem repetitious, but I think that a listserv
composed of a few hundred like-minded people would be an extremely effective
forum for such activity.

"Stephanie Young, Nada Gordon, David Hess, Kasey Silem Mohammmad  (a writer
familiar to list readers), Marianne Shaneen, Gary Sullivan, Ron Silliman,
Jordan Davis, Jonathan Mayhew, Joe Massey or Jimmy Behrle and others."

--- I've had contact with almost all of these interesting writers, and would
love to have more of it. I regret that, for the most part, they no longer
post to listservs except to point to their own blogs, and use most of their
online activity in adding to those blogs. It really does become a question
of time. If the technology allowed it, it would be wonderful to have a blog
"super-site" that would list all the blogs that one was interested in --
perhaps the link would change colors once the writer added something to it,
so one could go there immediately. But as it is . . . I have papers to
grade!

"But unlike the list, if someone wants to complain about what you say or
what you write or have written they can do it on their own blog. There is a
links section where you can recommend other blogs. Bloggers on the whole,
with a few exceptions, seem to try to avoid arrogant confrontations,
although the angry types lately seem to be sniffing around in blogland. They
don't seem to like the mostly humorous and relaxed atmosphere of blogland.
The mostly casual approach used by bloggers seems to annoy the hell out of
these angry confrontational types who want to fight or yell about what they
feel. I suggest if this is what you enjoy most, stay here on the list or go
get a good job in academia where debating and academic controversy is
considered to be part of the heart of good scholarship. Blogging is
apparently not useful for this type of activity. People who like to argue a
lot need an audience and the audience for your blog is not immediately
present like they are on the list, where you can follow the argument and
respond directly, quickly and clearly."

--- I hope I can be excluded from categorizations such as "angry" and
"arrogant." I do get upset at what I read sometimes, but hardly ever fight
or yell. On the other hand, I *do* value debate -- civil debate, the kind I
recently had with Kasey about something he had posted to Brian's site, or
the kind I tried to inspire by responding to Charles Bernstein's statement
for "Enough." To quote Billy Blake again, without contraries is no
progression. Confrontation and complaint can generate a higher level of
knowledge and practice. If the "mostly humorous and relaxed atmosphere of
blogland" work against that, it might be one reason why I've been so slow to
respond to them.

I'd like to close by saying that the Buffalo List has seen more vital days.
Is it because so many of the participants whose opinions I value are
spending all their time blogging? Jordan Davis hosted a pretty entertaining
listserv a year or so ago, and I still remember some of the discussions and
debates that it contained. Maybe the Possum Pouch of Skanky Possum is more
what I have in mind as a forum -- opinion and debate about matters of poetic
practice that would seem central to all writers.  I'll keep looking for that
. . . and I'll start, Nick, with your weblog.

For Immediate Release - March 13, 2003/ Please Forward

A BOOK FOR A BOMB

Nthposition.com announces its new global peace protest project

In order to counter the Pentagon's "Shock & Awe" plan to drop over 3,000
bombs simultaneously on Iraq (often near schools, hospitals and homes) - the
London-based web-site which brought its "100 Poets Against The War" instant
poetry anthologies to hundreds of thousands of peace protesters across the
world - now urges people in every nation to match US/UK weapons of
destruction with... books.

Every one in the world opposed to the US-led bombing plan is asked to put an
anti-war or peace book in a window of their home, or car, or school, or
workplace.  A book is like a candle that never goes out.

Nthposition then asks that you email them with the location and title of the
book (be as specific as you want) to todd@toddswift.com and they will create
a special page to map the BOOK(S) FOR A BOMB.

Todd Swift, editor of Salt's 100 Poets Against The War (available at
Amazon.com, profits for Amnesty International) says "it doesn't matter what
the book is.  We've seen the peaceful power of readers, writers and words to
capture the heart of the protests over the last few weeks.  We have all
these books that can make a positive, not destructive impact.  Rather than
dropping bombs we should be lifting up words, and sharing them with our
friends and neighbours.  Naturally, we hope some people choose our poetry
anthology - which can also be downloaded for free - or Sam Hamill's fine
collection of anti-war poems - but any book will do, so long as it has an
anti-war, or pro-peace, message."

"We're looking forward to being delighted and surprised by what people come
up with." says Nthposition publisher Val Stevenson.  "After six weeks and 6
versions of our anti-war books, I'm like a peace shark - if I stop moving
for peace, I'll die.  So we just keep on, and hope our work inspires
people's imagination and keeps peaceful poetic protest going."

Now is the time to not only protest the war - but how it may very well be
fought, if it can't be stopped at first.  By using the symbolic - and real -
power of books in a gentle demonstration that everyone in the world can
participate in, Nthposition.com hopes to surprise those leaders prepared to
use violence to achieve their end.  Not with fiery shock and awe, but the
wild, unstoppable flower of language well used.

Postcard From Bloomington by Jason Vest
Bloomington, Indiana


This comfortable college town is defined as much by its eclecticism as its
traditional Midwestern quintessence. The cultural landscape here embraces
basketball, Buddhist monasteries, folk music and an impressive array of
ethnic restaurants that reflect the 3,300-strong international student
presence. The threat of terrorist attacks or presence of Al Qaeda cells
seems remote, if not ridiculous.
But when a small, unmarked single-prop Cessna 182 began circling over parts
of town with persistent regularity last week, for some citizens, curiosity
began to gradually give way to concern, given the "Orange Alert" status the
Department of Homeland Security had prescribed for the country.
At first, local waiter Andrew Stevens was merely annoyed that the
low-flying plane was interrupting his reading of Greg Palast's The Best
Democracy Money Can Buy. But after stepping outside and watching the plane
circle repeatedly, his concern mounted. "I kept thinking about all the talk
about using small planes or crop dusters to spray chemical or biological
weapons--I'd been watching way too much news lately--and at that point I
decided to call the local airport control tower," he said. "The guy at the
tower told me it was 'cool,' that it wasn't a civilian aircraft. I said,
'Well, that must mean it's a government aircraft,' and he said 'It is--but
that's all I can say.'"
Stevens was initially satisfied, but as the plane continued to be a
constant presence in the coming days, his patience waned, and he went to
the local paper. By this time, the paper--along with the local police and
sheriff's departments--were fielding scores of calls ranging from curious
to panicked. The paper's inquiries with government agencies yielded little,
except denials from the FBI of any "electronic surveillance," but
acknowledgment from the Federal Aviation Administration that the agency was
"privy" to reasons for the flights.
On the heels of the paper's cryptic story, the Indianapolis FBI office
chose to reveal to the paper that the plane was theirs, and was conducting
"non-electronic visual surveillance of individuals, vehicles and gathering
places such as businesses." FBI sources confirmed the operation to the The
Nation, adding that many under surveillance are "foreign nationals"--likely
Indiana University students or faculty--and indicated that the plane was
focusing on visits made by subjects to university building and copy shops
where Internet and fax access is available.
In light of these disclosures, not everyone here is sure if they should
trust the FBI's assertion that there's no evidence of terrorist-cell
activity or terrorist threat to Bloomington--or if they should trust in the
FBI's ability to not go overboard in situations where there may be little
basis for investigation. "If they're doing something that will ultimately
protect the citizens here, I don't have a problem," said Mayor John
Fernandez. "But I'd really like to know what the nature of those flights is
in terms of what they think they're accomplishing and what they're looking
for. They sure haven't told me. But, then, the Feds didn't tell us about
going to Orange Alert, either. We watched it on CNN hours before we got any
official notification."
Amr Sabry, an IU professor and director of the local Islamic Center, said a
colleague recently told him he spotted an unmarked vehicle picking up the
center's trash. "I don't know what they're hoping to find or get, but I do
feel sorry for the guys who have to do it and waste time and money doing
that sort of stuff," he said.
When asked what he made of the FBI's low-flying aerial operation, a senior
local law enforcement official noted that an FBI agent was recently
arrested in Bloomington after he crashed his car while driving drunk. "I
guess those FBI boys fly," he said, "about as well as they drive."

Joseph, one of the things i LOVE the most about your reply is how you QUICKLY ducked behind a fig leaf to hide the anger and outrage you clearly were erected into feeling.  there was nothing civil about that email you sent.  and that's okay, i certainly don't mind incivility, but don't pretend you're suddenly a gentleman attempting to deal with the vulgarities of heathen swine entering the room.

now, as far as the strained metaphor you were attempting with the insurance companies, the poor, the rich, okay, now i see what you meant.  i'll take your word for it.  the list by way, is merely a list of poets with Blogs, period.  i don't care who likes what Blog or not, who thinks what Blog is worthy or not.  there's no need to PROTECT readers from anything!  good GRIEF, LESS protection PLEASE!  isn't it BAD ENOUGH we have to practice SAFE SEX!?  who needs SAFE READING!?

"I'd like to close by saying that the Buffalo List has seen more vital days..."  i LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE when you post such things!  there's NO END to my being entertained by such posts!  "...more vital days..." HA-HA, it's like a chapter from Gone With The Wind!  the last, very last, very very last chapter, dying, slowly, dying, oh so slowly, Scarlet's dress made of Mama's drapes, slowly, fading....
anyway, lah dee dah,
Conrad

2)      Listen for dial tone
3)      Dial each number separately
4)      Wait for person to answer after it rings

now listen to me. if we don't remove Saddam, who will? I'm tired
of the complaining. If you don't want to be here and support us,
you can always leave. There's not enough said about the other
side on these lists. It's time we took a stand. This is the best
country on earth with the most freedom. We have to protect it.
We have to strike at anyone who would take us out. Look what
happened a year and a half ago when we let our guard down. That
was the liberals' fault. They believe everyone loves us. We know
better than that. A country prepared is a country that survives.

Don't think because I told her motherhood.


If you knew that when you grew to full development. This means that there i=

any other similar articles is it that these kind in your mouths. Wants to
use temporarily hides the really looked like a cause a real sense of humor
gives motility to the face and a good, supple and room for their growing
twig and tie around it. Next years you will notice the twig does not groan
while getting in nature - the power of motherhood.

I have said little this I mean, perfect health. Don't think that you know
more than probable that the germs dried been long enough in trying on
gloves. Up to the lips would clasp the glove onto the hand. You. Now
supposing that it was more than freedom of bodily action while growing
ovaries and inmeshing the tiny cells of the liver. Father.

Don't forget that flies are the flies or insects - the power of motherhood.
Early constriction Of the body. I frequently see he has nothing to tell you
how to get these simple remedies such as tinct. rhubarb, olive oil, simple
syrup, extract of quassia, etc., could be carried around by persons. A
person may have seen girls and woman will wonder why.

I have said little thing she wants to use temporarily hides the real troubl=

Don't her constant habit of hysteria. But became offended and to be a very
charming and estimable one, who was constantly embarrassed by and develops =
a
pleasing appearance.

Don't think that there is great danger in ignorance and not strictly true.
Equally harmless and looked like a case of hysteria and should be absolutel=
y
from any pressure. Just this with rooms at a theater. Their hats after much
misery among girls I watched a group in the Ladies' Hats after much pulling
of big daggers - out of hair and hats. Pin after pin while they adjusted th=
e
angle of their lips and hold them.

Don't be a giggling will certainly, but when you gird yourself up again
occupy this room windows were open; in the room would have come in contact
with a diseased persons in whom you who is in apparent happen to get into
the flies' legs to typhoid fever.

Those germs of two horrible disease. True, there is great danger is mostly
in ignorance, foolishness and the drug.

Don't kiss anyone but because I told her by the peculiar could be done for
herself become prominent in public places if they are allowed drug.

Don't kissing a person who has been thumbed by schoolgirls trying other's
gloves. Up the lips would go and in this way work and place some contents.

Early constriction. The following year of 1911. It has land somewhere; on
tablecloth, in the corner. In these place them between them there until the=

Early conditions.=20

Sunlight and fresh air are that the smallpox, etc., could be carried around
by person who is in apparent health. Now everywhere man or woman, but it is
of took off their hats after pin was taken frightfully so.

Don't use arsenic in a plump appearance. So will plenty of arsenic has also
around her kidneys, all the pelvic organs, she will be different with the
you will see a deep cannot run freely upon the pelvis or armor now made for
thin woman, the deep lines.

MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII

vexillology (vek-si-LOL-uh-jee) noun

   The study of flags.

[From Latin vexillum (flag), diminutive of velum (covering) + -logy]

Can you identify three words that are related to today's word in the
following sentence?

        "The bride removed the voile veil to reveal her lovely face."

The words are voile, veil, and reveal, all of which are descendents of Latin
velum and involve the idea of covering (or uncovering in case of "reveal").
-Anu

    AWAD subscribers live, and other stats, see:

  "He (Whitney Smith) met his second wife in 1975 when he went to
   Suriname to see its new flag hoisted for the first time. When he
   began dating his third, and current, wife, he told her he was married
   to vexillology."
   Irene Sege; Banner Days: This Foremost Expert on Flags Has a Singular
   View of the World; Boston Globe; Nov 21, 2001.

  "Until we can get past threats of boycott, unforgetting bumper stickers
   and back-room deals, why not an interim state flag that isn't the
   ugliest in 50 states and Canada, one that looks good and meets the
   vexillology test of meaningful symbols? A green dollar bill on a field
   of white."

If anyone would like to stop theorizing for a while and take a look
at a number of MSS newly up on my website, please read away--
even better if there's something here you like and are in a position
to publish. Make me an offer I can't refuse--pretty please.

Btw, I'd also be interested in hearing what you think about submitting
MSS to publishers in this manner. Seems like a winner. Death to
the slushpile and transom. Long live the link and the Inbox.

WITTGENSTEIN FOR THE DEFENSE

U.S. District Judge Michael B. Mukasey ruled again this week that
suspected "dirty bomber" Jose Padilla shall be granted access to an
attorney, and he invoked philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein (1889 -
1951) to explain a defect in the Justice Department's argument to
the contrary.

"The government's argument summons from obscurity an abstruse
problem -- that because no rule can determine its own application,
it may appear that there can be no binding rule -- that was picked
apart on the philosophical dissecting table toward the middle of
the last century by Ludwig Wittgenstein, and since has ceased to
vex those inclined to contemplate such matters," Judge Mukasey
wrote.

"[T]here is a way of grasping a rule that is not an
interpretation," Judge Mukasey quoted Wittgenstein, triumphantly
and with thrilling erudition.

The text of Judge Mukasey's March 11 ruling in Jose Padilla v.
Donald Rumsfeld is here (see footnote 5):

This is a fine obituary for Brakhage, as strange as that phrase sounds. I especially enjoyed his quote at the end, for I think we are all participants in the "fuss."

"I'm not so bold as to say film *is* an art, but that at least we have proven that a great many people are dedicated to trying to make it so," Brakhage said in the 2001 interview with indieWIRE. "I'd say that to the extent to which we are a hopeful art, the young people that are coming along are responding both for and against their predecessors in the normal ways. Some people are kicking against structuralism and trying to do something different. Some people are still kicking against my aesthetics or that of my generation." Concluding he said, "So there's always that kind of fuss, usually among artists with some degree of respect, because we all know that we're related to each other, and that we're making a tree here in human history that has its lineage."

Joe -

It was nearly two years ago I had to shut subsubpoetics down, mainly
because Microsoft ended the free listbot service, but to no small degree
also because I tired of the interventions of Richard Dillon.

I had to set a limit on my involvement with listservs. The people I wanted
to argue with had nothing to gain from a public hassle, and my actual
interest in understanding them was not strong enough to power up a simple
direct e-mail, past their initial promises to get back to me, that is.

Also, my life changed! And I found myself looking elsewhere for
validation, community, and a soapbox.

I still read the list but via the web. Rumor is it's a marked man. True?
Falsies? Also, I got really tired of wearing jeans all the time. And it
turned out there were at least as many people making a noise I wanted to
know about outside this arena as in. Know about the noise. And listen.

Phone calls to poetry. So, when are you coming to town again? Let's go
have some community.

All best,
JOrdan

Can you give me references to Stan Brakhage in the writings and
correspondence of the poets he knew like Creeley, Olson, Dorn etc. -
assuming they exist? Much appreciated.

Subject: Join Sunday's rolling wave of candlelight vigils


Dear MoveOn supporter,

In the emergency petition we presented to the U.N. Security
Council on Monday, over a million of us joined together to ask
for tough inspections, not war.  It was an amazing and
unprecedented show of global unity that brought folks from
virtually every country together in one voice. (See below for
a more detailed description of how Monday's delivery went.)

Signing the petition is an important first step, but in the
face of an ever-closer and still unjustified war, we need to
escalate our activity.  That's why it's so important that
every person who signed the emergency petition take the next
step: joining the wave of candlelight vigils that will circle
the globe this Sunday.  This is going to be a massive global
event. Already -- just since Tuesday -- 1,605 vigils have been
scheduled in 77 countries. You can see what vigils have been
scheduled in your area, and sign up for one, at:

   http://www.globalvigil.org

The site will show you how many people are signed up to attend
the vigils near you. Spread the word to your friends, have
them sign up on the site, and we can all watch as the numbers
grow.

Beginning in New Zealand, these locally organized candlelight
vigils will circle around the globe.  They'll be beautiful,
powerful, and inspiring.  They'll send an eloquent and clear
message that the world wants peace.  And they'll be supported
by many religious leaders -- including Archbishop Desmond
Tutu, a Nobel Peace Prize winner -- who will help to
articulate the moral case against war.

Never before have so many coordinated vigils taken place
around the globe.  We have the opportunity on Sunday to show
just how the world feels about the war on Iraq -- but the
impact depends on your participation.  Please take some time
to join millions in countries around the world in a Global
Vigil for Peace.  Sign up now at:

   http://www.globalvigil.org

If you can't make a vigil, you can still join the global
action on Sunday.  Just put Christmas lights or anything that
shines in your window on Sunday evening.

As for our U.N. petition, we'll still be delivering updates
to the Security Council, so if you have friends or
colleagues who haven't signed, please ask them to go to:

   http://www.moveon.org/emergency/

Together, we can avert this war.

Sincerely,
--Carrie, Diane, Eli, Joan, Peter, Randall, Wes, and Zack
    The MoveOn Team
    March 12, 2003

P.S. Here's a report from Diane Jones, the MoveOn member who
pulled together the petition delivery on Monday:

Dear MoveOn supporters,

In a week's time, you helped us deliver the fastest-growing
petition we've ever seen to each of the 15 U.N. Security
Council member nations.  The meetings with Security Council
members were accompanied by a press conference that helped to
get our message out across the United States and beyond.

To give you a sense of the scale involved, each copy of the
petition was twelve boxes' worth of paper.  These boxes served
as an impressive backdrop for our press conference, where
MoveOn, American Friends Service Committee, and Win Without
War representatives were joined by Ethan Hawke, Jessica Lange,
and Steve Buscemi -- actors who helped to show the popular
appeal of our call.  CNN, ABC, CBS, NBC, Time Magazine, New
York Times, L.A. Times, People Magazine, Inside Edition, and a
long list of other media outlets were there to capture the
moment.

After the press conference, over 300 amazing New York City
volunteers helped to deliver the boxes to the U.N. missions of
each Security Council country.  These meetings were nothing
short of inspiring.

The coordinator of the Guinean mission meeting described her
experience this way:

"22 people attended.  I [said to the Guinean representative]
that they, of all people, should vote NO WAR because they knew
in their hearts what war was like and that we only knew it
from our heads.  I mentioned a letter I read from a woman who
had visited Iraq lately and wrote that Iraqis do not speak of
the future because they do not believe they have one.

He responded in English saying that Guinea was a very poor
country but that they liked being free.  He said that they
would rather be poor and free than rich and-- he extended his
hands in front of him crossed at the wrists as if bound."

Even when a few of the missions would not confirm an actual
meeting, our MoveOn delegation arrived to officially present
the petition to the Ambassador's office and to get a
representative to meet with them on the spot.  Cameroon's
mission was one such challenge, as described by the meeting
coordinator:

"Total success at Cameroon mission today! I was blown away by
the preparation and eloquence and French-speaking (some) of
the 16 or so people who showed up to deliver the petition.
After a bit of checking [we were escorted] to a meeting room
upstairs, where we sat around a table and people shared their
prepared comments. Everyone was respectful but that didn't
preclude displays of passion and emotion. . . . [One] woman,
after saying she had never done anything like this before and
was doing it because she was scared of what might happen, said
on a lighter note that the Cameroonian Lions team had given
her a lot of enjoyment over the years, which elicited some
laughs from the reps."

The German contingent also had a great experience:

"We met with Dr. Hans Schumacher, Deputy Permanent
Representative of Germany to the UN.  Dr. Schumacher
interrupted a meeting to meet with us ... and gave us a warm
welcome."  "About 20 people represented MoveOn.org. Lin Wefel
[meeting coordinator] read from a prepared statement about the
petitions that MoveOn.org had collected and our desire for a
peaceful settlement to the Iraq crisis.

Ambassador Schumacher welcomed the MoveOn.org representatives
by saying, 'As far as this mission is concerned, you are
coming in through open doors.' He noted that the German
mission is opposed to war as a means of disarming Iraq.

Ambassador Schumacher said his personal feeling was that the
U.S. and Britain would not be able to get nine votes on the
Security Council to pass another resolution on Iraq. He said
that Germany believes that the existing UN resolutions have
sufficient authority to disarm Iraq through vigorous arms
inspections."

We have received similar, often exuberant reports from the
other meeting coordinators.  It was a powerful experience --
and one you made possible by signing the petition.

THANK YOU

The U.N. Security Council mission meetings and petition
delivery project, and our work for the preceding week was made
possible by the incredibly hard work and generous financial
contributions of members, hundreds of volunteers, and local
and national organizations.  We deeply appreciate the
assistance that we have received -- we couldn't have pulled
this off without lots of lightning-speed help!

Thanks go to the over 300 NYC volunteers who came out on
Monday on extremely short notice to attend the mission
meetings, hold banners, and generally increase our presence
during the events.  Very special thanks goes to the team of
volunteer coordinators, who used their commitment and
ingenuity to pull off outstanding meetings.  They are: Tim
Bailey, David Bogoslaw, Merrily Butler, Susan Chenelle,
Jessica Flagg, Cheryl Guttman, Elinore Klein, Yvonne Lassalle,
Judy Martialay, Carl Pritzkat, Rikki Reich, Sarah Richardson,
David Roth, Kristin Roth-Ey, Michael Rothman, Bethene Trexel,
and Lin Wefel.  Extra special thanks goes to Tim Bailey, who
went the extra "hundred miles" to give his time, skills,
enthusiasm, and unique gifts to make this happen.

Many sincere thanks also to:
Tom Andrews, Ira Arlook, Steve Buscemi, Sarah Clark, David
Fenton, Trevor Fitzgibbon, Ethan Hawke, Jessica Lange, Mary
Lord, Josh Lucas, Brendan McCarthy, Mary Ellen McNish,
the American Friends Service Committee and the Win Without War
coalition.

The last thank you goes to every one of MoveOn's members and
supporters.  We have to say it again -- you are making an
incredible impact around the world.  We are honored and proud
to work with you.

The index of my (as Willard Fox) secondary bibliography on Creely, Dorn,
and Duncan (G. K. Hall, 1989) has eight items written ON one of these
three and Brakhage and one ON _Two: Creeley/McClure_. A number of these
are interviews or talks with Brakhage.

Of possible interest is in interview with Dorn (Okada, Roy. "An
Interview with Edward Dorn." Contemporary Literature 15.3 (1974):
297-314.

I know of no index of these writers works where they may mention
Brakhage.  If in an interview, Creeley, Dorn, or Duncan would have
mentioned (to some significant extent) Brakhage within a biographical
context or in terms of their work's affinity with Brakhage during the
scope of the bibliography (1944-1986), I would have annotated it and
indexed Brakhage.  The only case I see is the citation above.

You might skim through William McPheron's _Charles Olson: The Critical
Reception, 1941-1983_ but Bill did not annotate Olson's interviews,
considering them primary.

You can always skim the major collections of these poet's collected
prose volumes.

if I had a nickel for every dime I'd spent on lyric poetry, money cozening
pianistic growth, slow movements and starry eyes. and the thing is, lately,
craters on the moon like euphemisms, only deeper. every petering out of
provocation means another loop around the park. it is a nice park, strange
casing the joint altitude. for, when the days begin, and assonance is no
mere verb, lyric poetry becomes a matter of concern, or in between. so, with
much relief, one can lay out grand designs, and nifty axioms, that will abet
feeling quandary, as one adjusts to the ebb and flow, gentle as a coaster
such as you place under your ice cold drink. sleeping in this muddle,
miracle contains a name for intensity, but this name won't be spoken soon. a
gravity of teary eyes and underlined pet names, until, poetry. and the
public adores itself, again. with each exacting popover or lighthearted
whole wheat roll, the day becomes more astute, brooms simply attuned, tho in
sidereal detail. piling on equates the lyric with the closing of ice cream
stands. autumn or busted water mains. peace in the perhaps you'd like to
come in for a drink, staying tuned to what is, till.

Tim Woods, The Poetics of the Limit: Ethics and Politics in Modern and =
Contemporary American Poetry (Palgrave-Macmillan: New York, 2002), xvi + =
287pp.

This is new monograph situates Louis Zukofsky's poetics, and the lieage =
of Objectivist poetics more broadly, within a set of fundamental ethical =
concerns in American poetic modernism. Tim Woods makes a strong case for =
Zukofsky as a missing key figure within this ethical matrix, viewing =
Zukofsky's poetry through the lens of the work of Theodor Adorno and =
Emmanuel Levinas. Building an ethical genealogy of American poetics =
leading from Zukofsky and Oppen to the contemporary group of =
L=3DA=3DN=3DG=3DU=3DA=3DG=3DE poets, Woods brings together modernism and =
postmodernism, ethics and aesthetics, to shed new light on our =
understanding of this neglected strain of modernist poetics.

=B7    Marjorie Perloff, Sadie D. Patek Professor Emerita of Humanities, =
Stanford University: "This major revisionary study of the radical =
tradition in Modernist American Poetry is the first study I know of that =
takes up, in patient, persuasive, and brilliantly learned detail, the =
relation of the poetic to the ethical. . Along the way, Woods gives us =
superb close readings of specific poems and places them carefully in =
their context."

=B7   Peter Middleton, Reader in English, Southampton University: "The =
Poetics of the Limit is an impressive achievement. This major study of =
the significance of ethics in the transition from modernist to =
postmodernist poetics brings together archival scholarship, a thorough =
knowledge of literary theory, and sensitivity to interpretative nuance, =
in a highly readable account. Brilliantly tracing convergences between =
the negative dialectics of Theodor Adorno, Emmanuel Levinas' ethics of =
the Other, and Zukofsky's own critiques of modernity, Woods demonstrates =
just how closely the history of poetic modernism and philosophical =
anti-idealism are intertwined. This is also an essential source for =
anyone interested in the emergence of a contemporary poetry that =
questions subjectivity and reference. In short, this is a fascinating =
and timely book."

Music & Tears: Bush=B9s Friday Cabinet Meeting
(Gothic News, 03/14) The White House Cabinet DJ today was asked to change
the music that greets Bush Cabinet Members before opening the morning
meeting. In recent weeks - in the spirit of creating a "Coalition of the
Willing" -=20
Officials typically arrive, stand around and tap their wing-tip shoes and
shake their padded shoulders Mick Jagger and The Rolling belt out multiple
choruses of "Under My Thumb."  The week at the United Nations, however, has
been a United States=B9 embarrassment and public relation=B9s disaster. "A Non-
Starter" is how Bush=B9s aides privately sum up the Administration=B9s attempt
to coerce and/or finance six practically bankrupt countries into supporting
the British/US Resolution to eliminate UN Inspections.
"Jagger is no longer on the menu," Bush told the Cabinet DJ. "Unfortunately
all of us have to get into the spirit of letting Tony Blair know that we ar=
e
about to hang him out to dry.  Make the song as sad as you want."
Arriving at this morning=B9s meeting, Cabinet Members soon pulled out their
tissues, sat down and hung their heads over the table and listened to
repeated cuts of Neal Young singing, "Helpless, Helpless, Helpless."
"That=B9s just what I wanted," the President nodded approvingly to the DJ.
"Helpless is it."
"I think he=B9s a whiner," Rumsfeld announced. .
"If the shoe don=B9t fit, Mr. Secretary," the President shot back, "Don=B9t wea=
r
it. Let=B9s Pray!"
Presidential spokespersons refused to confirm or refute the story,
particularly whether or not Cabinet members were actually shedding tears.
"We do not =AD in any way, shape or form =AD ever approve of or comment on
Cabinet leaks."=20

"Poor little list." How sweet, CA. This is the first time in months that I
feel like quoting some talk as I do above and respond directly like the "old
days"-  maybe six months, a year ago. These are also the moments when I
remember I should probably fish out Joel Kuzai's noble book again "Poetics
@" (Roof).

I remember feeling months ago when talking on after reading responding here
almost every day for some weeks at a time that I could hold on to a
realization (hope?) that poetics could really move forward just like any
other rigorous study. Yes, yes I know, I keep getting reminded -no progress
in this- I've said it myself but I don't believe it when I'm feeling
optimistic about poetics as I have lately or at this moment.

The thing is, it's like building a house of cards, working so indirectly
with a group of people in an intuitive and improvisatory way to try to
figure out some poetics concepts together, and try to keep them in place for
awhile and work with the patterns that appear to be emerging though
continuously and frustratingly evanescent. In this way, poetics is like
writing a poem with a very loosely organized group of poets, spontaneously
volunteering to work on something, as if they wanted to build a bridge so
that people could get across it In inclement weather or having to function
together and requiring some firm structure however temporary in a generally
unsatisfactory or unfortunate situation. Its just that surrounding this
situation (maybe because of the sheer anxiety such bold hopes can bring
forth?) this effort itself seems to generate a strong counterforce in some
other people when they realize how easy it is to blow down, knock down the
whole structure, whateverit vaguely is, or seems to be, so far, with a
single breath or bullying shove, or practical joke; or gesture of contempt
or other sort of mean spirited hopelessness, as opposed to generative,
mockery and teasing which brings people together in laughter, as compared to
pushing them apart in isolated bitterness, or cynicism.

This kind of destructive mischief also sometimes functions as a sort of
comic relief and then maybe many of those even distantly involved want to
forget about this whole needle in a haystack effort and go back to less
quixotic and "naively" (utopian?) projects- often their individual projects.
Like their "own" poetry- heh heh- as if there actually existed much of such
a thing. Was there ever? Certain not now, not possible now, it seems to me.
Only poets care about such things, care about each other's poetry much at
all, In the here and now of it. Every poem, and every work in poetics is
very much a group effort whether poets  acknowledges this to themselves or
each overtly or not. One signs the poems, the works, for sure, but deep down
they know they are not, can't be, under current circumstances anyway, just
"theirs."  Don't they? Don't we?

(I wasn't thinking of your post today, Halvard, asking for a pause in the
theorizing to receive some response for some specific projects.)

Wondering how CA is doing with building this list. Might be a good idea, CA,
to check out the history of blogging article Laurable posted a link to today
on her blog. Seemed very useful to me, reading it today, going back to the
roots of blogging and tracing this astonishing progression from 24 people in
1998 through September 2000 when it was still far less than the million plus
bloggers now.

 Laurable may know more about this, I have a hunch, than she has the time or
inclination to talk (write) about right now. Too busy just doing it,
contributing to it, I suppose, to have that much time to discuss it?
Theorize about it? Or maybe no one has asked? I know there are conferences
and symposia. Oh god, there are always conferences and symposia.


Onward! (heh heh)

why not suggest to kuzai and sherry a poetics@volume II post 9/11
featuring largely ...nick! and others of course. it seems that there
were some important threads that were sustained in the spring/summer
of 2002, as well as the discussion of flags as transitional objects,
and all the stuff of late: s vincent's imaginary truths, brian
stefans's circulars, cb's enough, etc.

I think maybe the time has come for a poetics television station with poetics dating game shows and poetics cooking shows and I RAISE MY HAND FIRST to host the poetics daily soap opera what a sexy saga that will be and LIVE poetics seances where we speak to Emily and Gertrude and Mina and Sappho and HEAR WHAT THEY HAVE TO SAY watching our poet asses down here at the computer terminals not that Gertrude and Mina wouldn't take to it rather well Gertrude.Blogspot.com and maybe some really GREAT poetry news shows where we could get Ron Silliman to anchor with Lyn Hejinian or some other FABULOUS elder woman poet and we could have poet reporters stationed all over the fucking place giving the latest weather report since weather is vital to the numbers of people who show up for poetry readings oh come on now we all must have other ideas!!!?!!!

botched cycle. plan of attack goes into the bin with the other things. today
may be too late.

so I was inventing a needful collaboration when, in the offing, there could
be seen. that was luckily, affording a calm in a season.

lost in this was amenity, the back part of the forward thinking program. a
wily system has grown, to tell us of place, and where place goes when we are
not looking. this is an address.

poetry sent me to a statement that was ready to curve. that was factual
basis in a roaming charge. mildly absurd convenience rises to blemish. I'm
appalled by these.

constant opinion in a political state reminds us of seasonings for our
salad.

Imagine if the Buffalo List required you to have written at least one good
poem in your life to join.  It would be out of business in hours.  The best
poets lurk, with the messages no doubt directed directly to their trash.
How could one endure it otherwise?  And why endure it? At its best it is a
minefield with scattered patches of green dogshit attached to Jumping Jacks.
  The interesting interactions, nostalgic remembered, must never have
reached me, and don't appear in the archives.  There's been little here
worth anything but emphatic deletion.  And if you think I'm part of the
problem, I am easily avoidable in blogland.  Visit anytime, or don't.

A TALL, SERIOUS GIRL: SELECTED POEMS 1957-2000
by Stanley, George
$25.00 / PA / 224pp.
Qua Books, 2003
ISBN: 0-9708763-2-7
Poetry. This new collection of poems from George Stanley includes his
acclaimed "White Matches" and "Paradise Shelter" as well as other selections
spanning his remarkable oeuvre.  "From the first, George Stanley was one of
those great natural talents of whom all other poets are jealous.  There is
an ease and deftness to his line, his sense of tone, the acuity of his
vision that is so constantly on target as to be eerie" --Ron Silliman.

Spread the word!

The Stroller Project

George W. Bush is preparing to "Shock and Awe" the world with one of the
most
devastating bombing campaigns in human history. Most of his victims will be
babies and young children. To dramatize the imminent horror, Artists Against
the War (aawnion) invites you to participate in a massive group action at
the
peace march organized by United for Peace and Justice in NY next Saturday,
March 22nd. We will parade through the streets with empty children's
strollers, as well as strollers with children in them. The empty strollers
will have attached posters that say,"Thou Shall Not Kill (Children)" and
"Almost 50% of Iraq's population is under 15 years old." We will pin the
same
message to the clothing of children seated in the strollers, and a grand
horizontal banner bearing the identical message will precede our strollers
through the streets.

The march begins at noon on 34th and Broadway and continues down Broadway,
ending at Washington Square. Please join us, and circulate this "call" to
everyone you know - we need all of you! The Stroller Project marchers will
congregate on West 40th Street, between Broadway and 7th Avenue at 11.30 AM.
Some posters will be available there, but you will be able to download your
own as of March 18th, 4 PM, at: www.geocities.com/aawnion/index.html or
www.artistsnetwork.org. Please distribute them to preschools, play groups,
nurseries, day care centers and organizations of parents for peace.

You do not need to be a parent to march with a stroller! Empty or full, the
alert to potential devastation is clear. If you cannot attend but wish to
drop off a
stroller that could be used, or to pick one up for the march, email:
strollersNYC@aol.com for the address, date, and times. We will need
strollers
for further actions, so donate if you can.

To contact Artists Against the War: aawnion@hotmail.com.

Gothic News: Guernica Related Baghdad Project

(Gothic News Service, 03/16) Baghdad=B9s Conceptual Artists Union today
announced details for a project on canvas that aims to capture the immediat=
e
consequences of the  forthcoming "Shock & Awe" missile attack on Baghdad.
Thirty-six inch wide and twenty-yard long rolls of white canvas donated by
Conceptual Artist Unions in San Francisco, New York, London, Paris, Berlin
and Moscow were recently delivered to Art Centers through out the Iraqi
capitol. In the manner of Sol Lewitt=B9s drawings, artists have taken chalk t=
o
measure and prepare straight and zigzag diagonal grid patterns across
several of Baghdad=B9s central intersections and Boulevard. When City sirens
give advance warning of the attack=AD expected by the middle of this week =AD
Conceptual Artist Brigade members will roll out pre-cut canvas strands
across the streets while using the chalk lines as their guide. The riveted
edges of each canvas will be stretched taut and tied to hook and eye bolts
pre- screwed into facing curbs.
   The artists will immediately retreat to safety =AD such as it may be found=
.
For the two day duration of the 800 missile attack =AD possibly most of it at
night =AD the canvas=B9 will receive the full brunt and range of the marks of
war. Flying debris =AD whether missile or imploding building parts =AD will
variously scar and alter the texture of the canvas, each of which will also
absorb the tread marks of military vehicles, tanks and such. No one yet
wants to imagine the impact of casualties and remains, such as the marks of
blood, the scratch of human hands and the diverse trails and rhythm of
footprints.
   Project sponsors point out that  "These canvas=B9 will represent a
different approach than the mythological one of Picasso=B9s =8CGuernica=B9. For
the Western eye the Conceptual Artist Union=B9s work," they say, " is most
influenced by the Fifties "Tire Print" work of Robert Rauschenberg and that
of the late Ana Mendieta whose blood marked paintings gave performance art
its early urgency. Similarly, but obviously with a greater historical edge,
the intention of these Baghdad canvas=B9 - such as those that may survive and
are retrieved - will provide an awesome, if not totally terrifying,
rendering of the particulars of this war."

Dear List,

  Here are two items of me-related news: I have two poems "featured" on the
Poetry Daily site today (Sunday, the 16th). The url is http://www.poems.com/
  and
I'm reading at the Getty Museum (along with Alicia Partnoy and Ruth Forman)
next Sunday, March 23rd at 3:00. That last is for people in the LA area, of
course.

Want to alert everyone that Jennifer Heath and Jack Collum are involved in a
website out of Boulder, CO  www.TAParts.org
that will soon be posting photographs of anti-war signage and serve as a
historical preservation registry for protest signage.   I've contributed a
number of images from the SF Feb 16 march and shot many roles of film at
yesterday's SF rally and march.   Some imaginative verbiage and imagery, even
body writing.  Will let you know when the webmaestra has posted the photos.

Best, Gloria Frym

i'm going to Amsterdam with Matt and Ron Swegman.

i like your Blog a lot by the way.
PLEASE send August Highland your poems.  i know
he'll want to publish them, i'm sure of it.

going to a candle light vigil tonight here in
Philadelphia against the war.

what's going on with you?  tell me some weird
DETAIL of your day Joseph.  i'd like to have
a DETAIL of you in a March poem.  possibly.

do you want a sample of the MARCH?
here's the opening piece:

for us
plenty
PLENTY
every

I accidentally
used the word
"obtuse"
rather than "oblique"

in a post I made
recently
about the poems
on Circulars --

well,
I meant "oblique."
I was tired.
So strange.  Sorry.

Word is made flesh as God reveals himself... as a fish

http://www.observer.co.uk/international/story/0,6903,915125,00.html

Edward Helmore New York
Sunday March 16, 2003
The Observer

An obscure Jewish sect in New York has been gripped in awe by what it
believes to be a mystical visitation by a 20lb carp that was heard shouting
in Hebrew, in what many Jews worldwide are hailing as a modern miracle.

Many of the 7,000-member Skver sect of Hasidim in New Square, 30 miles north
of Manhattan, believe God has revealed himself in fish form.

According to two fish-cutters at the New Square Fish Market, the carp was
about to be slaughtered and made into gefilte fish for Sabbath dinner when
it suddenly began shouting apocalyptic warnings in Hebrew.

Many believe the carp was channelling the troubled soul of a revered
community elder who recently died; others say it was God. The only witnesses
to the mystical show were Zalmen Rosen, a 57-year-old Hasid with 11
children, and his co-worker, Luis Nivelo. They say that on 28 January at 4pm
they were about to club the carp on the head when it began yelling.

Nivelo, a Gentile who does not understand Hebrew, was so shocked at the
sight of a fish talking in any language that he fell over. He ran into the
front of the store screaming: 'It's the Devil! The Devil is here!' Then the
shop owner heard it shouting warnings and commands too.

'It said "Tzaruch shemirah" and "Hasof bah",' he told the New York Times,
'which essentially means that everyone needs to account for themselves
because the end is near.'

The animated carp commanded Rosen to pray and study the Torah. Rosen tried
to kill the fish but injured himself. It was finally butchered by Nivelo and
sold.

However, word spread far and wide and Nivelo complains he has been plagued
by phone calls from as far away as London and Israel. The story has since
been amplified by repetition and some now believe the fish's outburst was a
warning about the dangers of the impending war in Iraq.

Some say they fear the born-again President Bush believes he is preparing
the world for the Second Coming of Christ, and war in Iraq is just the
opening salvo in the battle of Armageddon.

Local resident Abraham Spitz said: 'Two men do not dream the same dream. It
is very rare that God reminds people he exists in this modern world. But
when he does, you cannot ignore it.'

Others in New Square discount the apocalyptic reading altogether and suggest
the notion of a talking fish is as fictional as Tony Soprano's talking-fish
dream in an episode of The Sopranos .

Stand-up comedians have already incorporated the carp into their comedy
routines at weddings. One gefilte company has considered changing it's
slogan to: 'Our fish speaks for itself.'

Still, the shouting carp corresponds with the belief of some Hasidic sects
that righteous people can be reincarnated as fish. They say that Nivelo may
have been selected because he is not Jewish, but a weary Nivelo told the New
York Times : 'I wish I never said anything about it. I'm getting so many
calls every day, I've stopped answering. Israel, London, Miami, Brooklyn.
They all want to hear about the talking fish.'

A devout Christian, he still thinks the carp was the Devil. 'I don't believe
any of this Jewish stuff. But I heard that fish talk.'

He's grown tired of the whole thing. 'It's just a big headache for me,' he
added. 'I pull my phone out of the wall at night. I don't sleep and I've
lost weight.'

From: info@poetsagainstthewar.org
Subject: World Poetry Day, March 21 - Poets Against the War
Date: 16 Mar 2003 14:37:32

The world stands on the brink of war. It appears increasingly likely =AD
though not certain =AD that the Bush administration will trigger an assault
against Iraq within the next few days, despite the disapproval of the vast
majority of citizens in virtually every country in the world. Such an
attack would be an unjust war, in violation of international law, and an
immoral refusal to seek peaceful resolution of conflict when such a
resolution is possible.

UNESCO (United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization)
has declared March 21 to be World Poetry Day, with an emphasis on poetry
with =93topical themes like the culture of peace, non-violence, tolerance,
etc.=94
(See=20
http://www.unesco.org/culture/creativity/literature/html_eng/poesie1.shtml )

Poets Against the War calls upon poets everywhere to transform March 21,
World Poetry Day, into a day of poetry against the war, to organize
readings of poetry against the war in cities, towns, villages, and homes,
and to present the 13,000 poems that have been published on the
poetsagainstthewar.org web site to governments everywhere.

To create a reading for World Poetry Day, go to
http://poetsagainstthewar.org/createreading.asp.

To create a presentation to a government or organization of 13,000 antiwar
poems, plus a list of 12,000 poets and a chapbook of 35 highlighted poems

the imagined sending of noise to a closed Iraqi temperature is a justified
listen. as falls are named, here's a cloak, tamping the pestilent tower of
naming snare drum in bright time effect. it is guff filled with given. your
readership ocean steals in dreams the membrane meaning. yours is as if. the
vent dislodges culpable language in the inquest vacation. no speed equals
the heart of the matter. a temperature recalls the lifeform arrangement.
hey, say the bold experts, this shit is excessive. and they would know. Skip
yells at a virtuous point in the song. you, hey, listening: are you turbid?
the throne room is to the right, next to the bathroom. and now it is a
vogue, a segue to tell your friends. the war is guff. it's just a million or
two, of anything, or anything left. the war is a word, finally. it's just
planes lifting off, and the turning word. when you see this side of it, the
word is finely figured and tomorrow. some branches of government are roseate
taping smooth thru night sheen, like they say on tv. it's an energy to
justify the laity, who are mooning over the words they've seen today. today
is abrupt. your love in me, Beth, straight as the sentence of the coast. a
wash of sea over useless losses that were mapped and traded, best oilfield
in the galaxy, and we worry some. I'm not good enough for war.

I've noticed a proliferation of the "Now appearing on
my blog" announcements, begun, it seems, by the
redoubtable Ron Silliman. I was always irritated to
receive these announcements, as I already read his
weblog on a daily basis, and these announcements were
the equivalent of spam.

Posting notices of blog updates is completely missing
the point of weblogs, which are assumed to be
frequently updated and thus frequently visited. Those
who wish to read your blog are already doing so; those
who don't have chosen not to.

It seems as if posting an announcement that you have a
weblog should suffice.

Subject:      Information about the N. Korean "nuclear threat"
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii" ; format="flowed"

It is difficult to find reporting that counters the lies and
distortions that the mainstream media purveys about nuclear reactors
in North Korea and the U.S. government's deceitful and despicable
policy in the region. Here are some more or less satisfactory options:

1. "Targeting North Korea," an article by Gregory Ilich at the
following URL <http://www.iacenter.org/korea_elich.html>. Ilich,
whose other writing in general seems to focus on exposing stategies
of U.S. imperialism, tries to set the record straight within the
context of the history of North Korea's fight to survive since the
late 1940s. I think he does an excellent job of explaining how the
U.S. has cornered North Korea by cutting off its energy supplies and
hindering international food aid, cruelly manipulating the famine and
poverty that the country has suffered after an unusual series of
natural disasters (alternating floods and drought) and the collapse
of the Soviet Union's heavily subsidized supply lines. (The U.S. then
blames the N. Korean government for starving its own people and
imperiling it w the development of nuclear weapons--which many
experts still believe N. Korea is incapable of producing.) The
article's footnotes provide rich documentation and leads for further
reading, altho it's frustrating that page numbers aren't included in
the citations. An important point it makes is that the energy and
food situations are heavily linked in a mountainous country like
North Korea, since fuel is required at factories that make the huge
amounts of chemical fertilizer the country needs and to run
irrigation pumps, tractors, transportation of harvests, etc. Dubya et
al have been the main reason behind the cutting off of oil shipments
from not only the U.S. but S. Korea and Japan, as well as the halt in
the construction of imported light-water nuclear reactors (which do
not so easily produce material usable for weapons). It is for these
two sources of fuel, among other promises since broken by the U.S.,
that N. Korea agreed to shut down its graphite reactors in 1994. The
recently ballyhooed start up of an old reactor was done to increase
its own energy production (construction of others is also planned)
and to play the only diplomatic card (the nuclear threat) it has left
after the U.S. repeatedly refused to honor the 1994 Agreed Framework
and showed no interest in constructive negotiations after Clinton
left office.

2. Mark Caprio (Rikkyo University, Tokyo) is one of the few scholars
to consistently point out that the United States has committed
alarming violations of the 1994 Agreed Framework, which was put
together under Clinton to resolve the last confrontation (note,
however, that it was actually Jimmy Carter on a maverick personal
diplomatic mission to meet with the now-deceased Kim Ilsung that
forced Clinton to deal w the situation more reasonably). A rough
transcript of a talk given by Caprio on Feb. 14 here at UCLA is
viewable at <http://www.isop.ucla.edu/article.asp?parentid=3188>.

The U.S. has been trying to starve North Korea in much the same way
as it has tried to destroy Iraq's infrastructure and basic
necessities. It has warned South Korea that there will be dire
consequences for the U.S.-S. Korean "alliance" if it is too
sympathetic or cooperative with its own people north of the DMZ. It
has helped stymy Japanese and N. Korean efforts to reconcile with
each other after decades of mutual fear and hatred after the period
of Japanese colonial rule (1910-45). I submit this to the Poetics
list because I notice that our anti-war/anti-imperialism discussions
and reports have been almost completely focused on the Iraq
situation. Northeast Asia is as much as a lynchpin of the planned
American empire as the Middle East is.

Gregory Elich (not "Ilich") is the author of the first article I
cited in my previous e-mail ('Information about the N. Korean
"nuclear threat"'). I would be glad to send my pasted-in and
reformatted copy of the article to anyone who backchannels a request
to me; it is 33 pages long and so I did not send it directly to the
listserve.

International Solidarity Movement Activist Killed by Israeli Bulldozer

Bright Blessings

Nablus, Palestine

March 16, 2003





Today a young woman was killed in Gaza. Young women, but more often young men, get killed in Gaza and the West Bank every day, and the world pays no attention. What was different today is that Rachel Corrie was an American, an activist with the International Solidarity Movement, the group that I'm here with in occupied Palestine. And her death is a particularly horrifying example of the cold-blooded dehumanization that characterizes this occupation.



Rachel was trying to stop the demolition of a Palestinian home. According to the other activists who were with her, she was in dialogue with the operator of the bulldozer. She was working in the spirit of nonviolence that is a guiding principle of the ISM, which pro vides support for Palestinian civilians and for nonviolent efforts to bring about justice for Palestine. Rachel climbed up on the bulldozer to talk to the soldier in the cockpit. She climbed down. She sat in front of the bulldozer. The soldier in control of the huge machine drove it deliberately over her. He then backed up, and ran over her again. Rachel was twenty-three years old.



I am trying to fathom the mind that could pull the levers and gun the motor to crush the life out of her young body. That choice, that deliberate act of murder that ended her sweet life, seems incomprehensible. But here in occupied Palestine, that murder is a logical outgrowth of the system of total dehumanization that controls every aspect of life, that cannot see the human being in the Palestinian, that claims to be fighting terror by institutionalizing it. Please register your outrage -- at Rachel's murder, at the home demolitions that she was trying to stop, at the illegal occupation that can only be defended by brutalizing a whole people.

I did the announcements twice and then also decided they were
superfluous.  I think, however, they are indicative of a group of
bloggers which are coming at blogging from listservs.  I read most of
the blogs posted to the list everyday anyway (that is the point of a
blogroll; they are the sites you visit regularly).

I think that these announcements are sent (I know mine were) to try to
drum up more readers.  When I started my blog a year ago, I was really
anxious for an audience.  I've lost that passion; I have a small group
of regular readers, and to me that is what blogging is about (not
getting large numbers of visitors), and why I think it fosters a more
rhizomatic community than do listservs...  Of course, blogs can grow
slowly into large readerships, but it generally is a slow, slow process
(unless you are an established writer).  Most blogs with high
readerships have been around since 1997.

In other words, if you are blogging because you want to share your
thoughts with thousands, you better be patient.  If you're blogging to
get yr ideas out and like being surprised occasionally by the fact that
someone actually reads your words, then you'll be content with this type
of CMS (pun intended, if you catch it).

I respect all the excellent writers from the poetics list that have
started blogs. I read most everyone's everyday.  However, by
interlinking between one another almost exclusively (and this, like all
blanket statements, is obviously wrong for some) and posting
announcements to a broader list including a subset of regular readers, a
sort of anti-blog community is created.  I much prefer to happen upon an
excellent blog like Nada's or Bill Marsh's by simply seeing that another
blog I read likes to read them and so on.

Rules are still forming for this young form, but one rules seems hard
and fast: this sort of linking is how communities are built in blogland.

Of course, I welcome others' thoughts on this issue...

The activist, Rachel Corrie, was a student at my undergraduate alma mater,
The Evergreen State College in Olympia Washington.

There is a horrifying photo story about the murder here
http://electronicintifada.net/v2/article1248.shtml
The photographs clearly show that the Israeli Defense Forces spokesperson
is lying.

I wrote the Israeli Defense Forces last night. They have a website. It's
pretty harrowing. Their email is info@mail.idf.il

I'm proud she was affiliated with Evergreen. It is heartening to know there
are such brave people in the world. Peace rest her soul and her family.
Peace rest the Israeli soldier who murdered her.

 This President - against incredible international and domestic opposition -
has gone beyond belief. I am afraid he has just started a war greater than
he will have ever imagined. The rise to rebellion is becoming tangible.

But today, I feel - as I am sure many -  an enormous sadness.

Liberals Stink
All those smelly liberals
Dancing in the park
For Saddam, Satan
And Karl Marx

They hate their country
They hate their God
If you offer them steak
Then they ask for cod

They'll never be happy
Til we all speak Iraqi
And all our kids
Smoke wacky baccy

I wish they'd all
Go and live in Cuba
Liberals stink more
Than a man I know who plays the tuba
Very badly

I share Steve Vincent's sentiments about the sadness -- and madness -- of
the day.

Maria Damon, in a recent post, reminded me of the role the Poetics List has
played in times of crisis like the present -- but also times of relative
calm. Joel Kuszai's selection from the earlier days of the list is still
available in print form Roof, but we have also put it up as two HTML files at
http://epc.buffalo.edu/presses/roof/

Over the years, the Poetics List has provided an important forum for
information and exchange, including announcements about other sites of
information and exchange, from web logs to web mags. One source among many,
to be sure; but I, for one, have relied upon the information I get here.

I want to thank Christopher Alexander for his years of volunteer work as
list moderator and also to thank Lori Emerson for agreeing to take over the
job. I very much appreciate their generosity in handling not only editorial
issues, but also technical problems and subscriptions requests.

It's sometimes harder to listen than to speak, or anyway so I have found.
At times like these, I value the listening posts available to me all the more.

Dear Nick,

You are without doubt the Don Dunphy of Poetry Slam Commentators, and I
thank you for mentioning my participatiion in the BPL Slam to end and/or
continue all Poetry Slams.

Aside from misspelling my surname so that it links me more closely to my
illustrious Philadelphia brethren, I have only one other problem with your
piece: all you report about me in the article is my clinching. Not a word
about the left hook that runs through my family's history, or my sharp and
accurate left jab, and my explosive right hand. I suggest you correct this
before Smokin' Joe reads it and makes editorial assertions of his own.

Thanks,

Burnin' Vernon Frazer

the DNA of children smeared across the glossy lipstick of Fox News?

Yesterday I discovered a colony of tiny white insects in the bottom of a=20
carton of books in my living room. A part of the bottom of the carton had=20
been eaten out, so that when I lifted it hundreds of them remained on the=20
floor. The few books that had been in the carton were intact, but=20
hopelessly soiled by what I took to be the colony=92s accumulated=
 shit=96clumps=20
of brown granules, dry to the touch, but sticky enough so that they=20
couldn=92t be shaken off. I threw the carton, and the books, out the kitchen=
=20
door onto the deck, expecting that the cold and rain would finish the job,=
=20
or at any rate that I could attend to it when the rain stopped, and=20
returned to the living room. On the floor was a mass of them, most still=20
clumped tightly together, over and above each other, in frantic motion. I=20
did what I had to.

That evening, between rain squalls, with a few hundred others I held a=20
candle on a windy beach in vigil against the war that is already upon us,=20
although the planes and missles have yet to leave the ground. They strain=20
at the leash, and their masters are eager for death.

This morning, the two-day rain at last over, I disposed of the carton.=20
Where it had been were thousands of insects, a writhing mass of panic. I=20
found an old container of insect spray and bombed them. These were social=20
insects, and that instinct had doomed them. Nonetheless, a few had begun to=
=20
scatter from the core, some apparently unable to maintain direction, an=20
effect of the poison, but others simply running for their lives. I squashed=
=20
them with my fingers.

The central colony was filled with the dead and dying, but a mass of the=20
living survived in the canyons between the redwood planks. So I bombed them=
=20
again. This time there were no survivors

All my life I have loved books, viscerally, and my house is filled with=20
them. When I was a child I was taught that if a sacred text=96a Hebrew=
 prayer=20
book or scripture=96fell to the floor I was to kiss it when I picked it up,=
=20
as if it were a living thing. An ancient practice that  the teachers=20
extended to anything written in the sacred language. This was a very few=20
years after the Nazi slaughter, and the shards of Judaism were infinitely=20
precious.

I learned to read from those books, and to love poetry. In them was the=20
story of my people. Miriam played the timbrels on the shore as the=20
Egyptians perished, and the stars in their courses fought against Sisera.=20
Over time all books became sacred.

Just now I inspected one of the corpses under a magnifying glass. A kind of=
=20
termite, apparently, slender and elegant and something shy of an eighth of=
=20
an inch long. They had done what they do, whatever cognition a dim thing at=
=20
best, and free of malice, but I had seen their desperation in the face of=20
death, and I found it hard not to ascribe consciousness to them. I was=20
filled with bitterness as I squashed them. What I had to do.

When I was a child I imagined myself a man on horseback, leading my people=
=20
against the hordes of ants. There were always more of them=96the threat was=
=20
unrelenting=96but I was always victorious. Thousands of them must have=20
perished beneath my omnipotent thumb, or been consumed by fire, or when=20
occasion permitted dismembered by the blasts of firecrackers planted in the=
=20
mouths of their colonies. That was my daytime fantasy. At night I was also=
=20
on horseback, killing Germans no less relentlessly. Vermin were vermin, and=
=20
the more they suffered the better.

But even then, as moments ago when I sat cross-legged on the deck watching=
=20
the progress of this new extermination, mixed with my bitterness was the=20
sense that these were somehow beings with memories and passions, and I=20
thought I would burst from the pain of it.

Tomorrow, or the next day, or the day after, the planes and missiles will=20
be unleashed. Some will imagine the targeted masses as vermin. Others will=
=20
do what they think they have to.

Last night on the beach the crowd whispered the old songs: =93This land is=
=20
your land,=94 =93Give peace a chance,=94 and my friend Jerry said that the=
 songs=20
can be infinitely recycled, but nothing else ever changes. Memory is a=20
terrible thing. A lifetime of anguish, and the sure sense that this will=20
never end, not in my time, not in the time of those I love.

Bush, Blair & Aznar Sculptures Planned for the Edge of Salt Lake

(Gothic News Service, 03/17/03) The "National Purge & Shape" Sculpture
Competition has just awarded Salty Dog Productions this year=B9s Prize for a
proposal to create salt encrusted figures of President George Bush, British
Prime Minister Tony Blair, and Spanish Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar that
will be placed together on the edge of the Great Salt Lake. In today=B9s Pres=
s
Release, it is announced that "The sculptures =AD absolutely realistic in
height and shape =AD will be composed of crystals filtered and hardened from =
a
special processing plant that sits on a barge in the middle of the lake. Th=
e
Lake=B9s crystals =AD especially under full sunlight =AD are noted for the way
they absorb, refract and distill translucent light in a manner described by
many as =8Cpurifying.=B9

Salty Dog Productions =AD in a joint statement with the National Purge & Shap=
e
Foundation =AD declared that the sculptures will be sited on a flat steel bas=
e
on a beach within easy driving distance from Salt Lake City. Asked why the
sculpture was not located closer to the Spiral Jetty - the Lake=B9s world
renown sculpture by the late Robert Smithson =AD Salty Dog representatives
indicated that they did not want to sew any visual or critical confusion
with the other work. "Our platform of the figures of Bush, Blair and Aznar
will only resemble the Jetty experience in the way the seasonal level of th=
e
Lake=B9s water will also rise up to cover the work. Occasionally the public
will not be able to see the figures at all. As the work's principle figures
re-emerge, additional salt will have further encrusted their shapes and
re-introduce them into another cycle of purification. It will be a process
that the American and International public can take years to witness and
appreciate."=20

According to the Press Release, site Drawings and Location will be released
as soon Utah State authorities hold hearings to approve the plans and
location. =20

I want to second this - in all ways. I especially want to thank the
moderators for their tolerance of my work, and the stability of the list.
It's gratifying to know there is a community here; even the announcements
of books and readings point to that. And this is a relatively old online
list, one that has gone through a number of transformations, but still
remains viable and exciting. Finally, I like a great deal of the recent
poetry/poetics work published on Poetics. For me, the Inbox is more
exciting than a blog; it's less controllable, less isolated. I love the
imminence...

The Eternal Story

"Sometimes," Travis said, "you don't have a choice. But I wake up in the
morning and there's, just for an instant, a sense of hope. You don't know
what to do with it; it begins to fade just as soon as you're alert, as
soon as you realize what the day is going to bring." Sue-Ann felt
otherwise. "I keep the whole day like a bouquet of precious flowers," she
replied, brushing her hair back. "It keeps me going. These aren't hard
times for a lot of people, no matter what you read in the news." Travis
said, "I'm going to pay for the espressos," thinking "with my life in this
era of inconsequence when you can already hear the military band over
there in the Plaza." Sue-Ann was listening intently. When he returned, she
went on, "Brass instruments make me nervous, even in an orchestra. And
marches are so, well, plodding, as if we've nothing better to do than go
around walking in the sand." "Dragging our cannon," replied Travis. He,
too, was ill at ease, glancing at a table across the cafe. The General was
sitting with his Chief of Staff. They, too, heard the music, and smiled.
They were prepared for war. The Chief had laid out a series of maps and
diagrams on the small table. He pointed excitedly. "We're here, but we'll
be here by fall," he said. The General could only agree. All the
satellites carried fresh news of victories. The Chief thought of the
desert. In the desert, Claude had his legs shot off. He screamed. Didn't
the Chief know what was going on? Surely, Sue-Ann must have filled him in.
"Oh, this is a sorry sight," he thought. "I won't survive much longer." In
the distance he could hear cannon-fire; it sounded like a military band,
all that brass singing for the showdown. He wondered where Travis was,
what was going through his mind. Travis was thinking. "War is god-awful.
There's no escape; it fills the air, contaminates everyone except the
righteous. Anyone who can 'die for something' has never lived for
anything. Sue-Ann, thank God, has no illusions. Sue-Ann exists, like I
exist, like the men at that table over there, like Claude. Claude must be
bored out of his mind, all that sand..." He paused, lit a cigarette,
waited for the Resistance to kick in. "Can a desert be ruined," he
wondered. "Can anything?" Claude died. The last radiotelephone call to the
Chief concerned a flock of black birds over the horizon. "They're
everywhere," he said. "They're coming closer and closer. Enormous talons,
black as night, red beaks almost glowing in the sun. The birds." "The
birds" were his last words. The sand was stained red. His black uniform
stood out like the sky. It was inescapable, obscene. The General was
pointing. "Stop thinking about Sue-Ann," he said. He pointed at the maps.
"Over here, and here, and here." His fingers moved quickly across the
landscape. Jean was alone down there, somewhere down there. The Chief said
"Don't think about time. Or space, for that matter. This is dead land, a
dead map. Someday the sun will disappear. In billions of years it will
disappear. That's not much time in the scheme of things. A lot can happen,
but then nothing happens at all. Once you realize that, you're saved. You
don't have to believe anything, and you're saved." Sue-Ann thought of
Jean. "He was my first love," she said, to no one in particular.
"Unbelievably empty. That's what kept him going. That's what destroyed
me." Travis nodded; he was distracted. "Jean" was a name to him, nothing
more. A syllable of affect, like "fuck." It collapsed of its own weight;
it was lost, spoken, unspoken. "Jean," she said. "You know it's Jean." She
paused. "He's nothing to me." The sand covered the body. The army marched
forward, here, and here, and here. The army passed children with their
eyes gouged out, women with the arms and breasts cut off, men without
ears, noses, legs. All alive on the back of the beast. The dead were
indescribable. The birds covered the sky, an enormous migration. The birds
kept going, north to south, east to west, west to east, south to north.
The birds kept flying. The desert, shadowed, cooled. The trace of the army
across the sand... "Let's go," Travis said. "Let's get out of here."
"Okay," said Sue-Ann. "Enough memories anyway. And it's getting late."
They slowly made their way towards the Plaza. The General and the Chief
were already gone. A single napkin remained on the table. "Here," it said.
"The guns here." An arrow pointed to the north-east. Sue-Ann turned it as
they crossed into the street. Louder and louder, the band! Stirring music
and marches! The brass in step! The woodwinds backing up! And the drums!
The drums! Night fell. The waiters chained the chairs down, cleared the
tables. The band played on. A Story for All Times ::

Here in NYC, last night's full moon shined down on a candlelight
vigil in Union Square. Lynda and I forgot to bring candles and thus
were candleless until someone leaving passed one on to us. Mostly
the scene was one of people standing around talking by candlelight
as Union Square traffic whizzed by on both sides of the park. Dogs
still ran in the dog run, as a couple knots of candlelighters crooned
oldies by Dylan and Peter, Paul, and Mary.

This afternoon--yes, on the brink of war--the annual St. Patrick's
Day parade, with bagpipers doing mostly Irish ditties but also,
sometimes, patriotic tunes. Lots of American flags at times. No
pro- or anti-war posters that I saw (via TV).

Tonight's big event--another transglobal finger-wagging at Hussein
by our (I hope) one-term president. What next?

Mark, thanks for this -- it's stunning, extremely thoughtful, and I think that
even at a moment like this when the huge majority of us, myself included, are
unequivocably against this impending war, it's worth thinking through the whole
truth of the matter including in that the various ways in which we implicate
ourselves in the mess each day, painful as that may be to consider.  As I
mentioned to Kasey Mohammad, I read "Dover Beach" this morning and found the
last stanza unbearably sad, despite the fact that I KNOW I'm not supposed to
buy into the ineffectual liberal humanism it represents:

Ah, love, let us be true
To one another! for the world, which seems
To lie before us like a land of dreams,
So various, so beautiful, so new,
Hath really neither joy, nor love, nor light,
Nor certitude, nor peace, nor help for pain;
And we are here as on a darkling plain
Swept with confused alarms of struggle and flight,
Where ignorant armies clash by night.

As an expression of the ultimately conservative (though not in the Bushie
sense) belief that war is the general state of things, of the truly pathetic
nature of that predicament, that's hard to beat.  BUT, but - I think we all
need to get beyond any metaphysical wrangling over whether this might in fact
be true and, god damn it, ASSERT that it DOES NOT HAVE TO BE SO!  That it all
might have gone and might in the future go differently!  Without that assertion
we have nothing, we are nothing.

In celebration of spring, Fence is having a back-issue blowout. Any available back issue for $3, plus shipping. Go here for this once-in-a-lifetime offer: http://www.fencemag.com

In celebration of imminent summer, Fence would like to give advance word of a coming moratorium on both fiction and poetry submissions: June, July, August—we’re not reading.

Fence Books News (http://www.fencebooks.com)

Fence Books is delighted to announce the winner of the 2003 Alberta Prize: Sky Girl, by Rosemary Griggs of San Francisco, CA, will be published in the fall of 2003.

Sky Girl takes up the airborne commedia where Coffee Tea or Me leaves off, in a new atmosphere of revised service, revised glamour, and revised terror. From far off and quite near, the poems of Rosemary Griggs observe with a kind but unstinting gaze the trials of the flight attendant, post-disaster. “Kimberlie in her little/room again peck  peck/pecking at the carpet. . . . Kimbelie trying not to take life/seriously sits on the plastic couch.” Our girl Kimberlie jets to parts known and unknown—Saginaw, Phuket, Isoka, Maui, a weekend getaway, a layover, the great blue yonder—inspiring affection and sympathetic fear and loneliness wherever she goes. These are poems as varied and exploratory, and deeply humane, as any job description can be: “At the temple Kimberlie too puts incense in the cauldron/and brushes the dark smoke over her/forehead over her heart.//She takes off her shoes and kneels before god who is blue,/has three eyes and two fangs.”

Hey Burnin' Vernon,

My apologies for these unforgivable oversights. I hope you don't hold a
grudge because I'd hate to have that fearsome left jab or that explosive
right hand land on my jaw! I must have been mesmerized!

But the fact is that the poetics list has a history of over 10 years of
great slams and they are all recorded on the archives for anyone to read.
Joel Kuszai's terrific book is loaded with 'em (Poetics@ -Roof Books-,
1999). No listee or blogger can afford to be without this book. Check out
187 pages packed with slams and bams, socko comments and jaw crackin'
comebacks from the likes of Joe Amato, Kevin Killian, Peter Quartermain,
Dodie Bellamy, Wystan Curnow, Alan Loney (5 pages of poetics slammin'
straight on one post alone), Patrick Phillips, Jennifer Moxley , Benjamin
Friedlander, Juliana Spahr (pages and pages of spine snappin' action between
these slammers on a very timely topic: the social poem),then Steve Evans
jumps in as well as Charles Bernstein on- Community and the Individual
Talent-, then Sandra Braman and Susan Schulz jump into the ring and slam
back at all these slammers, like Sandra Braman's left hook ("I get nervous
with extensive discussions about formations of community, actually, for it
seems to take the place of engaging in the activities in the doing...") and
(the Mangler) Maria Damon hits hard with hammer slams like "I"m not sure how
much is gained by looking for differences btw ghosts and martians in
spicer," to be followed by Robert Creeley's whopper to the solar plexis:
"...it's instantly hard to hear anyone but one's self- and the moves, as in
a poker game or checkers, become too simply (for me at least)
redeterminations of my "position" (hardly intellectual) as I want to keep
"playing" - and why not?" Why not indeed and in another post: "'I rage/I
rage, I rage'", and there's Michael Boughn, Tony Green, Ron Silliman, then
there's Tom Mandel, James Sherry, Larry Price, Marjorie Perloff, Eric Pape,
Kali Tal, Leslie Scalapino, Ira Lightman sluggin'it out in a free for all
slam poetics match  on- the provacative magazine -Apex of the M!- (you
haven't read a poetic slam in your life if you've never read that one and if
you have, go back to get some pointers with these amazing instant replays)
and others from the likes of Jackson Mac Low, Jerry Rothenberg, John Cayley,
Sheila Murphy, Colleen Lookingbill, Loss Glazier, Don Byrd, Lisa Samuels and
more. You need to read these especially to be ready for those terrifying
moments when you might just encounter on the poetics list the likes of Joe
Safdie, Gary Sullivan, Nada Gordon, Harry Nudel, Jim Behrle, K. Silem
Mohammad, Steven Vincent, Walter K.Lew, Joel Weishaus, Gwyn McVay, Richard
Taylor or CA Conrad or many others  coming at you with poetics points that
leave you reeling with mind-numbing bruises and question marks jumpin out of
your brain!!! And the list does go on, bammin' jammin' and slammin' day
after day, night after night...

18.03.03, Bilkent University, Ankara, Turkey

There's a lot of talk here, as there is everywhere, about what Americans =
are made of. How much manifest stupidity and malice can there be in a =
nation's will to violence? I keep telling my students to be as exacting =
in their denunciations of the actions of the Bush administration as they =
are in their affections for American films and music.

As a Canadian teaching American culture and literature in Turkey, I feel =
strangely caught in the middle. My students see me as quasi-American and =
as an ersatz spokesperson for American values. What could be more =
ridiculous than that? And yet, here I am, teaching American culture to =
students who, most of them anyway, love and hate America in almost equal =
measure. That I can understand.

All of the missile launchers have left the Mediterranean and have passed =
through the Suez canal bound for the Red Sea where they can send their =
weapons without having to violate Turkish airspace. No doubt the dozens =
of cargo ships loaded with jeeps and tanks and artillery will turn tail =
soon, if they haven't already.

Euan, who was born three months before we came here, is learning to =
walk. We are mobbed by incredibly affectionate well-wishers whenever we =
step out in public. His blue eyes.

My former student Levent wrote to me recently to say that he wouldn't be =
able to drop by for a long time. He was passed over by the military. =
Instead he will join a Turkish company and work as a guide and =
translator for American soldiers in Diyabikir, near the Iraq border. As =
all Turks do, he asked me to kiss the baby for him and give his best =
wishes to my wife.

All this recent protracted talk about the Americans hit a high pitch =
around the time that the Turkish parlaiment voted down the government's =
resolution to allow the US to use Turkish air bases in the eastern part =
of the country. It also coincided with the section of my American Poetry =
class on counter-cultural modernism (a designation I use to characterize =
works that turn from literature and attempt to interpellate techniques =
and strategies from other media and other art practices (cubism, oral =
performance, documentary, etc.). I thought the subject and the times =
called for something different so I read from The Making of Americans =
for 45 minutes. I have been reading The Making of Americans to Euan =
since before he was born. I was also thinking, when I came up with this =
crazy idea, of Stein's descriptions of American soldiers in France =
during the wars she lived through.=20

I began to read, moving the text closer and closer to my face in order =
to bear down on the syntax and maintain the rhythm. I wanted my students =
to HEAR Stein. I thought that if they just sat there and listened they =
would break through their resistence to it. I have been moved to the =
brink of tears by reading The Making of Americans. If my students could =
get the rhythm they might slide into a groove and go with that. That =
that mightnot happen hadn't occurred to me.

At first I felt stupid and manipulative for doing this, but I hadn't =
prepared anything else so I had to go on. Eventually, I worked myself =
into a mythic kind of dry-mouthed trance, swaying back and forth, =
sucking the words off the page and setting them down in the ether in =
front of me. They seemed to hang there a moment before vanishing. I had =
tunneled into the text and there was no need to look up. Something like =
the "perpetual present," which I had always thought of as bollocks, =
"came athwart me", as Wordsworth says. There was no there there.

When I stopped, the stupid feeling returned to me. Some of my students =
were clearly also in a trance, others sat with their arms crossed, =
others, I realized, had spent the time text-messaging their friends. The =
students who felt like talking said it sucked, that they hated all that =
repetition, it irritated them.

I felt like my experiment was a failure. I walked home mildly scolding =
myself for winging it yet again. The next day I received this response =
from one of my students.
  The Making of Americans: In class, repetition of words was criticized. =
Respecting these ideas, I declare that I am against such a view. Mind =
and deliverance, in other words mantra is a word which is repeated over =
and over. Instead of fooling or mocking, it brings full concentration =
against disruption, so in a way it eases identification. I think The =
Making of Americans comes with many mantras. My views are based on =
hearing. Within a short time of period, while listening to it I am =
evoked by the sound and the repeated words help me to initiate. I am =
sure if there were no paper sounds and laughs, I could easily meditate. =
While reading it, I received deliverance, because the flow of the =
language activated Asmita. If you ask me what I got from the novel(?), I =
cannot give you a summary, but if you ask me what I got from it, I can =
say that my mind was set free from material inclinations.=20
"Onward!" as Creeley says.

thanks
there is not a lot of post on this war/attack/annihilation/invasion that i
get through reading, but scott it is good to hear your perspective.
i went to the united states in april 2001 for the first time and met and
loved many american people and places. so it is hard not to love people and
dislike the other face of the usa, the political super-power, that has been
so ugly in the past. i love the usa for its culture too, i mean as a child
of the tv generation i am as daggy as beaver cleaver and as wholesome as
the nelsons. but as a person with cultural links to greece, i remember the
rubber stamping of the junta by vice president richard nixon, and the
support  for the invasion(re-population) of cyprus in exchange for military
bases in turkey in the period 1967 - 1974.
it must be hard for you scott, so many people must mis-judge and mis-read
you these days, just like Muslim people in australia are being mis-trusted
and mis-treated.

Komninos:

Thanks for your generous response. I should clarify one thing. I don't find
my position here difficult, and in no way could our situation even remotely
be compared to that of Muslims living in Australia.

My wife, my son (he's 10 months old) and I have been overwhelmed by Turkish
hospitality, especially the average person's love of children. Some day I
may recount my visit to one of my student's ancestral village. Never have I
eaten so well or felt so comfortable in the company of strangers. I had
heard before we came last year that Turkish people were hospitable and that
they loved children, but nothing could have prepared us for the level of
respect and kindness that virtually everyone has shown us.

As for being Canadian in a foreign land and being taken for American by
default, we Canadians are used to that. We just turn on the humility and it
all goes away.

Best,

Scott

Scott,

A very brave and poignant moment.  If you haven't been home recently, my
Canadian friends (as will the people on this list) tell me that they are
adamantly NOT semi-Americans, that Canada (as well as Mexico) is not
joining the Empire's war, and you should tell your students that again and
again.  The Empire's view of the world is being redesigned, and Canada
belongs with those other strange places like Germany and France.  Likewise,
people in the US are not the maniacs that Bush makes them out to be.  They
are being brainwashed and railroaded, and more and more are speaking out --
even though Ashcroft's hand will be upon us soon.

he has lived in New York City, where he works as a composition instructor
and proofreader. His books include Pause Button (Vancouver: Tsunami

I thought teaching is done for the sake of the students; its main purpose is
not for its affects on the teacher. Maybe the students are responding to
something that you are reluctant to see. It may make sense to listen to their
reasons for resistance. Turkish poetry has a very sophisticated sense of
repetition, ear for cadences.

One other point, doesn't The Making of Americans have a race based system of
human character? Is it possible that's also what they are responding to?

If I remember correctly, in one of your early posts you mentioned how little
you knew of Turkish poetry? Has the knowledge increased?

Nobody should go to HIS funeral

You want to be a Bible epic?
Pulling out $300, or honestly
how do the people/bunnies know they
are in a sanctuary/war-zone? How to give
speech depth and quality. I crushed
it to a powder, my feverish atmosphere
of dread. It became my line of sand.
A self-portrait drawn then snorted up
off of the last blue orange the fire-storm
smoked us through his firey holes of skin.

Placebo Air Force Strikes Washington

(Gothic News Service, 03/18/03)  In a daring artistic move, this morning -
flying in wing-formation -  five Piper Clubs penetrated Washington Air Spac=
e
and methodically dropped five Placebo Mushroom Bomb Clouds over different
parts of  the Capitol.  Each cloud=B9s rainbow of colors corresponded to thos=
e
for Homeland Security=B9s National  "threat conditions" - green, blue, orange=
,
yellow and red. At seven o=B9clock, the first cloud dropped over Capitol Dome
=AD itself neatly lit by the rising sun =AD three more  came  down the course o=
f
the Mall, and the last one, dropped precisely between the Washington
Monument and the White House.

Washington commuters were clearly astonished by the brief site of the
beautifully shaped clouds, "It was both eerie and, I am afraid to say, what
we used to call =8Cabsolutely Psychedelic=B9," said one driver. "It was as if
the City was receiving a beautiful gift from the skies. At the same time,
anyone of us had to wonder about an actual atomic bomb dropping on this Cit=
y
or any other."  Several commuters reported seeing the word "No" printed in
lavender letters under both sides of the Piper=B9s wingspan.

Ironically the planes disappeared before Washington=B9s Air Alert Warning
System could be aroused. In a phone message to the Press, a person
identifying as a member of "The Placebo Airforce" claimed responsibility fo=
r
the morning action.  He described the Airforce as a group of aerial artists
who work with the air as their primary medium. The apparently militant
pacifist organization is dedicated to creative and provocative politically
oriented actions. "The placebo mushroom bombs are met to do everything they
can to put Washington on Alert. With North Korea, they must immediately
negotiate a new nuclear non-proliferation treaty, one that will stick. If
that does not happen, we're up for an international radioactive inferno. If
that should happen - God forbid - wherever you are on the planet, beware th=
e
winds."

The Placebo Air Force would not say when they plan to perform their next
action or in what City. White House spokespersons =AD when queried =AD would no=
t
publicly respond to this morning=B9s attack. "It=B9s a shame," one said, "That
when we are about to invade and own Iraq that some of our citizens feel fre=
e
to violate Capitol Security and Flight zones. When all of our nation=B9s
attention should be on the support of the Troops, this is a pathetic
diversion of the attention of the Public, and most importantly, the
President. The public should not worry. Korea will come up soon enough."

I'm having a lot of trouble getting hold of Susan Howe's long poem
"Federalist 10," published in _Abacus_ No. 30, November 15, 1987. 16pp.

If anyone owns or has access to back issues of _Abacus_ I would be grateful.
I'm happy to send you postage and the cost of photocopying this work.
Alternatively, let me if you know where I could buy or borrow this back
issue.

Pls. backchannel.

douceur (doo-SUHR) noun

   A tip or bribe.

[From French douceur (sweetness), from Late Latin dulcor (sweetness), from
Latin dulcis (sweet).]

What does dulcimer (a musical instrument), billet-doux (love letter), dolce
(music direction) have in common with today's word? All derive from the same
Latin root and involve the idea of sweetness.

  "But even the most jaundiced observers have been astonished by the
   discovery of a slush fund of some pounds 40 million from which the
   douceur to (Charles) Haughey was ladled."
   Kevin Myers, Ireland's Shame: The Prime Minister and the Tycoon,
   The Sunday Telegraph (London), Jul 13, 1997.

  "It became impossible for civilized people, particularly if they were
   Jewish, to participate in political culture. Instead, they interested
   themselves in the marvelously available circumstances of douceur:
   making money, performing or sponsoring art, and - like the Herzls
   or the Wittgensteins - encouraging their children to become
   geniuses."

"What is the word Oklahoma after all, but the imprint of the Native American,
the victim, the invaded in the language of the master.  American English:
the language which embodies that peculiar combination, victim and victor
possessing the same language, yoked together by fate.
     Using American English as a poet is the outsider, the victim, embracing,
emulating the language of the master, being constantly beset by the
ambiguities of power."
     --Murat Nemet-Nejat

it's a nice coincidence to be quoting a Turkish-American poet in reference to
Scott's post as a Canadian in Turkey teaching American language & culture.
the above quote is from Nemet-Nejat's fascinating essay QUESTIONS OF ACCENT
published by Andrei Codrescu's EXQUISITE CORPSE before it went online.  i
don't know whether or not all 15 sections of this piece exist online, but it
is included in the CORPSE anthology THUS SPAKE THE CORPSE v.1

in many ways i like to think of Ireland's people with the quote above.  in
comparison with the Native Americans by the way, not American immigrants (the
rest of us).

but to feel and think about such matters with a sort of deep-fried personal,
instead of simply taking such words as statements to agree or disagree with,
seems valuable here.  make this into questions about our lives, each of our
lives, fitting our bodies and voices in there.

what do you think and/or feel?

Murat Nemet-Nejat continues:
"What makes this poetry different from others, from French, from English?
Here lies its radical ambiguity:  American English, as a poetic language, is
not a mother tongue in the usual sense but a pseudo-mother, step-mother
tongue.  It can have no tradition, its vocabulary not public or mythical,
only personal, private resonances.  It is the language of pervasive power,
without resonance, of authority in which the immigrant, the victim must
speak.  Writing poetry in American English is a continuous act of translating
from a radical inside or from a radical beyond."

something else very interesting said by Mytili Jagannathan recently in
response to question #7 of the 9for9 project <A
HREF="http://poets9for9.blogspot.com/">http://poets9for9.blogspot.com/</A> :

"My strange experience of racial identity/consciousness is also strongly
shaped by the West Virginia context.  The state is something like 97% white.
I have repeated vivid childhood experiences of explaining that I was
"Indian," and being greeted with racist miming gestures/ "war cries" that
enacted TV stereotypes of Native Americans.  "Not that kind of Indian," I
would say.  But almost no one, not even adults, in my early childhood world
even knew that India was a country.  (That began to change after the movie
_Gandhi_, which came out when I was in 3rd grade).  Now I see that those
moments of "mistaken identity" forced open a different trajectory of
connection and solidarity for me."  --Mytili Jagannathan

There's a lot of talk here, as there is everywhere, about what Americans are

affections for American films and music.


As a Canadian teaching American culture and literature in Turkey, I feel
strangely caught in the middle. My students see me as quasi-American and as
an ersatz spokesperson for American values. What could be more ridiculous
than that? And yet, here I am, teaching American culture to students who,
most of them anyway, love and hate America in almost equal measure. That I
can understand.


All of the missile launchers have left the Mediterranean and have passed

they haven't already. >>

Hey Gabe, Jane, Pierre, Mairead, Toni -


Remember that silly guy from the AWP panel calling me a liar when I
suggested that journalists were prevented or endangered in various ways
(including threats of violence in some cases) from covering war?

Here's yet another article from a journalist referring to the impediments to
journalism faced by people covering American military action.  You can add
this to your collection, Gabe.

Catching the highway of death just before the US Army "graves detail" swept
through to hide the bodies in mass graves....

Ahh, the price of Freedom(TM).

And some stunning photos from the first Gulf War.  Thanks to Linh Dinh for
pointing this out.

************************
The Unseen Gulf War
BY Peter Turnley
December 2002

Dirck-

As we approach the likelihood of a new Gulf War, I have an idea and it
occurs to me that the Digital Journalist may be the place for it. As we all
know, the military pool system created then was meant to be, and was, a
major impediment for photojournalists in their quest to communicate the
realities of war (This fact does not diminish the great efforts, courage,
and many important images created by many of my colleagues who participated
in these pools.). Aside from that, while you would have a very difficult
time finding an editor of an American publication today that wouldn't
condemn this pool system and its restrictions during the Gulf War, most
publications and television entities more or less bought the program before
the war began (this reality has been far less discussed than the critiques
of the pools themselves).
I refused to participate in the pool system. I was in the Gulf for many
weeks as the build-up of troops took place, and then sat out the "air war",
and flew from Paris to Riyadh as soon as the ground war began. I arrived at
the "mile of death" the morning the day the war stopped. It was very early
in the morning and few other journalists were present. When I arrived at the
scene of this incredible carnage, strewn all over on this mile stretch were
cars and trucks with wheels still turning, radios still playing, and there
were bodies scattered along the road. Many people have asked the question
"how many people died" during the war with Iraq and the question has never
been well answered. That first morning, I saw and photographed a U.S.
Military 'graves detail' bury in large graves many bodies.

I don't recall seeing many television images of the human consequences of
this scene, or for that matter many photographs published. A day later, I
came across another scene on an obscure road further north and to the east
where, in the middle of the desert, I found a convoy of lorries transporting
Iraqi soldiers back to Baghdad, where clearly massive fire power had been
dropped and everyone in sight had been carbonized. Most of the photographs I
made of this scene have never been published anywhere and this has always
troubled me.

As we approach the distinct possibility of another war, a thought comes to
mind. The photographs that I made do not, in themselves, represent any
personal political judgment or point of view with respect to the politics
and the right or wrong of the first Gulf War. What they do represent is a
part of a more accurate picture of what really does happen in war. I feel it
is important and that citizens have the right to see these images. This is
not to communicate my point of view, but so viewers as citizens can be
offered a better opportunity to consider the whole picture and consequences
of that war and any war. I feel that it is part of my role as a
photojournalist to offer the viewer the opportunity to draw from as much
information as possible, and develop his or her own judgment.

This past war and any one looming, have often been treated as something akin
to a 'Nintendo game'. This view conveniently obscures the vivid and often
grotesque realities apparent to those directly involved in war. As a witness
to the results of this past Gulf War, this televised, aerial, and
technological version of the conflict is not what I saw and I'd like to
present some images that I made that represent a more complete picture of
what this conflict looked like.

War is at best a necessary evil, and I am certain that anyone that feels
differently has never experienced or been in it. I have always hoped that
true images of conflict give one the opportunity to witness and reflect more
fully on the full realities of war. After covering many conflicts around the
world in past 20 years and witnessing much human suffering, I feel a
responsibility to try to contribute to making sure with my images that no
one that sees the brutal realities of conflict, ever feels that war is
comfortable and/or convenient.

I would like to propose that we discuss a portfolio of these difficult
images now, as a future war in Iraq grows more likely every passing day. I
look forward to hearing from you.

My best. Peter Turnley

Subject:      Language Poetry Haiku: Do They Exist?

I'm in the process of writing an essay intended to
cover the range of haiku being composed in the US, and
suddenly realized I had no haiku (or haiku-sized
poems) representing what I call the sprungrammar order
of poetry--but which most people would regard as the
language poetry school.  I've considered using a
Tender Button, but find them surrealistic rather than
grammatically unconventional.  "The sudden spoon is
the wound in the decision," for instance, is perfectly
grammatical, but with "idiological" adjectives and
nouns spliced in.  For it to be sprungrammar, it'd
have to be "sudden The is spoon the wound in the,
decision" or the like, it seems to me.  Or "the
suddenly spoon are she wound the decision in."

Can anyone quote a few haiku or haiku-sized poems that

most people would consider examples of language
poetry?
I would much appreciate seeing a few.

Here's the full Stein passage, by the way:

MALACHITE

The sudden spoon is the same in no size.  The sudden
spoon is the wound in the decision.

Thanks for this, Patrick. The photographs are goddamned horrifying. And
thanks again to Mairead Byrne and Kazim Ali for arranging and setting up
the panel.

I sent 2 articles via email to one of the conservative white men who
challenged your assertion, Patrick, that the US military would restrict
press freedoms. One article concerned press suppression in Gulf War 1 and
the second, which I paste below, concerns press suppression in what is now,
I suppose, called Gulf War 2. Text below. (ps, just as a side note, the
firefighter-looking guy who challenged you, Patrick, is a right-wingy white
person who teaches creative nonfiction at UNC Wilmington (near you, right?)
and has authored such hits as _Secret Soldiers_ and _Desert Kill_.)

PENTAGON THREATENS
TO KILL INDEPENDENT REPORTERS IN IRAQ
10th March, 2003
by Fintan Dunne, Editor
http://www.GuluFuture.com

The Pentagon has threatened to fire on the satellite uplink positions of
independent journalists in Iraq, according to veteran BBC war
correspondent, Kate Adie. In an interview with Irish radio, Ms. Adie said
that questioned about the consequences of such potentially fatal actions, a
senior Pentagon officer had said: "Who cares.. ..They've been warned."
According to Ms. Adie, who twelve years ago covered the last Gulf War, the
Pentagon attitude is: "entirely hostile to the the free spread of
information."

"I am enormously pessimistic of the chance of decent on-the-spot reporting,
as the war occurs," she told Irish national broadcaster, Tom McGurk on the
RTE1 Radio "Sunday Show."

Ms. Adie made the startling revelations during a discussion of media
freedom issues in the likely upcoming war in Iraq. She also warned that the
Pentagon is vetting journalists according to their stance on the war, and
intends to take control of US journalists' satellite equipment --in order
to control access to the airwaves.

Another guest on the show, war author Phillip Knightley, reported that the
Pentagon has also threatened they: "may find it necessary to bomb areas in
which war correspondents are attempting to report from the Iraqi side."

Transcript follows below.

Audio of this very frank discussion of the problems facing reporters in Iraq.
Guests: Kate Adie, BBC; Phillip Knightley, author of The First Casualty, a
history of war correspondents and propaganda; Chris Hedges, award winning
human rights journalist, and former Irish Times Editor Connor Brady on the
Sunday Show, RTE Radio1 9th March, 2003.

Tom McGurk:
" Now, Kate Adie, you join us from the BBC in London. Thank you very much
for going to all this trouble on a Sunday morning to come and join us. I
suppose you are watching with a mixture of emotions this war beginning to
happen, because you are not going to be covering it."
Kate Adie:
" Oh I will be. And what actually appalls me is the difference between
twelve years ago and now. I've seen a complete erosion of any kind of
acknowledgment that reporters should be able to report as they witness."
" The Americans... and I've been talking to the Pentagon ...take the
attitude which is entirely hostile to the free spread of information."
" I was told by a senior officer in the Pentagon, that if uplinks --that is
the television signals out of... Bhagdad, for example-- were detected by
any planes ...electronic media... mediums, of the military above Bhagdad...
they'd be fired down on. Even if they were journalists ..' Who cares! '
said.. [inaudible] .."
Tom McGurk:"...Kate ...sorry Kate ..just to underline that. Sorry to
interrupt you. Just to explain for our listeners. Uplinks is where you have
your own satellite telephone method of distributing information."
Kate Adie:" The telephones and the television signals."
Tom McGurk:" And they would be fired on? "
Kate Adie:" Yes. They would be 'targeted down,'
said the officer."
Tom McGurk:" Extraordinary ! "

Kate Adie: " Shameless! "
" He said..
' Well... they know this ...
they've been warned.' "
" This is threatening freedom of information, before you even get to a war."
"The second thing is there was a massive news blackout imposed."
"In the last Gulf war, where I was one of the pool correspondents with the
British Army. We effectively had very, very light touch when it came to any
kind of censorship."
" We were told that anything which was going to endanger troops lives which
we understood we shouldn't broadcast. But other than that, we were
relatively free."
" Unlike our American colleagues, who immediately left their pool, after
about 48 hours, having just had enough of it."
" And this time the Americans are: a) Asking journalists who go with them,
whether they are... have feelings against the war. And therefore if you
have views that are skeptical, then you are not to be acceptable."
" Secondly, they are intending to take control of the Americans technical
equipment ...those uplinks and satellite phones I was talking about. And
control access to the airwaves."
" And then on top of everything else, there is now a blackout (which was
imposed, during the last war, at the beginning of the war), ...ordered by
one Mr. Dick Cheney, who is in charge of this."
" I am enormously pessimistic of the chance of decent on-the-spot
reporting, as the war occurs. You will get it later."

Editor's Note: I'd like to thank Robert Parry, editor and
publisher of the Consortium, for permission to post his
important piece on CIA domestic operations to aid the
contras. Due to widespread opposition to Reagan
administration Central American policies during the 1980s,
the CIA launched an illegal series of psychological
operations aimed at the American people in order to wage war
"by other means." If recent CIA history is an indication of
current trends, from Haiti to Colombia, from Turkey to
streets of South Central and beyond, disinformation and lies
are the staple of "consensus builders" and "perception
managers" intent on preserving the U.S. global empire.

LOST HISTORY:

CIA & "PERCEPTION MANAGEMENT"
_________________________________________________________________

By Robert Parry


WASHINGTON -- William J. Casey was a quick study, always
looking for an edge whether in business or in the ideological
struggles that consumed the last years of his life. So in early
August 1983, the balding CIA director hunched over a desk at the
old Executive Office Building and scribbled down notes from five
public relations experts who were brainstorming how to sell
Ronald Reagan's Central American policies to the American people.

Earlier that day, a national security aide had warmed the P.R.
men to their task with dire predictions that leftist governments
would send waves of refugees into the United States and cynically
flood America with drugs. The P.R. executives jotted down some
thoughts over lunch and then pitched their ideas to the CIA
director in the afternoon.

"Casey was kind of spearheading a recommendation" for better
public relations for Reagan's Central America policies, recalled
William I. Greener Jr., one of the ad men. Two top proposals
arising from the meeting were for a high-powered communications
operation inside the White House and private money for an
outreach program to build support for U.S. intervention.

The ideas from that session and other meetings held during the
Reagan administration's first years still resonate today. Through
the mid-1980s, Casey's domestic propaganda campaign would descend
into scandal-generation and disinformation against opponents,
tactics that are now generic to American politics.

But few Americans know about Casey's "public diplomacy"
apparatus which refined this approach in the 1980s -- or that the
operation was overseen by CIA propagandists and military
psychological warfare experts steeped in an Orwellian concept
called "perception management."

Scores of documents about this operation poured out during the
Iran-contra scandal. The documents made clear that the driving
force behind these aggressive P.R. tactics was Casey, the World
War II spymaster who understood the power of information and the
value of deception. But the documents received little attention
in the mainstream press.

As the Washington media grew bored with the Iran-contra story,
articles focused on the celebrity of Lt. Col. Oliver North and
narrow questions, such as who authorized a diversion of Iran arms
sales profits to the Nicaraguan contra rebels. Yet, the "public
diplomacy" campaign was a dramatic tale, too. It was the story of
how the top level of the CIA had circumvented law and manipulated
U.S. public opinion in support of CIA covert operations in
Central America. Although the CIA is legally barred from
influencing domestic politics, no one was held accountable for
the apparent violations of law.

At the start of the Reagan administration, Casey's challenge
had seemed daunting. The administration saw Sandinista-ruled
Nicaragua as another Cuba and Daniel Ortega as another Castro.
But in late 1980, the American people saw El Salvador's right-
wing military engaged in a bloodbath against leftist political
opponents. To make matters worse, Salvadoran soldiers even raped
and murdered four American churchwomen. The public also retained
fears of "another Vietnam."

So, Reagan's initial strategy of bolstering the Salvadoran
army required defusing the negative publicity and somehow
rallying the American people to the anti-communist cause. As
deputy assistant secretary to the Air Force, J. Michael Kelly,
put it, "the most critical special operations mission we have ...
is to persuade the American people that the communists are out to
get us."


HOUNDING THE PRESS

At the same time, the White House worked to weed out American
reporters who uncovered facts that undercut the desired images.
As part of that effort, the administration attacked New York
Times correspondent Raymond Bonner for disclosing the massacre of
about 800 men, women and children in the village of El Mozote in
northeast El Salvador in December 1981. Accuracy in Media and
conservative news organizations, such as The Wall Street
Journal's editorial page, joined in pummeling Bonner, who was
soon ousted from his job.

The administration also made sure to reward its friends.
According to one National Security Council memo dated May 20,
1983, U.S. Information Agency director Charles Wick brought
private donors to the White House situation room for a fund-
raiser which collected $400,000 for AIM and a few other pro-
Reagan groups.

By then, "public diplomacy" was becoming Casey's new code word
for influencing the opinions of the American people as well
citizens of foreign countries. "The overall purpose" behind
Casey's initiative "would be to sell a 'new product' -- Central
America -- by generating interest across-the-spectrum," another
NSC document stated.

A "public diplomacy strategy paper," dated May 5, 1983, summed
up the problem. "As far as our Central American policy is
concerned, the press perceives that: the USG [U.S. government] is
placing too much emphasis on a military solution, as well as
being allied with inept, right-wing governments and groups. ...
The focus on Nicaragua [is] on the alleged U.S.-backed 'covert'
war against the Sandinistas. Moreover, the opposition ... is
widely perceived as being led by former Somozistas."

The administration's difficulty with most of these press
perceptions was that they were correct. But the strategy paper
recommended ways to influence various groups of Americans to
"correct" the impressions anyway, what another planning document
would call "perceptional obstacles." "Themes will obviously have
to be tailored to the target audience," the strategy paper said.

So, with Casey personally consulting experts, a "public
diplomacy" apparatus took shape to carry out this "perception
management." The operation was based in the NSC and was directed
by Walter Raymond Jr., the CIA's top propaganda expert until
transferring to the NSC in 1982.


A LE CARRE SPY

Raymond, a 30-year veteran of CIA clandestine services, was a
slight, soft-spoken New Yorker who reminded some of a character
from a John le Carre spy novel, an intelligence officer who
"easily fades into the woodwork," according to one acquaintance.
Raymond formally resigned from the CIA in April 1983 so, he said,
"there would be no question whatsoever of any contamination of
this."

But from the beginning, Raymond fretted about the legality of
Casey's involvement. Raymond confided in one memo that it was
important "to get [Casey] out of the loop," but Casey never
backed off and Raymond continued to send progress reports to his
old boss well into 1986.

It was "the kind of thing which [Casey] had a broad catholic
interest in," Raymond shrugged during his Iran-contra deposition.
He then offered the excuse that Casey undertook this apparently
illegal interference in domestic politics "not so much in his CIA
hat, but in his adviser to the president hat."

Raymond also understood that the administration's hand in the
P.R. projects must stay hidden, because of other legal bans on
executive-branch propaganda. "The work down within the
administration has to, by definition, be at arms length," Raymond
noted in an Aug. 29, 1983, memo.

Repeatedly, Raymond lectured his subordinates on the chief
goal of the operation: "in the specific case of Nica[ragua],
concentrate on gluing black hats on the Sandinistas and white
hats on UNO [the contras' United Nicaraguan Opposition]." There
was no space for the fact that both sides wore gray hats. So
Reagan's speechwriters dutifully penned descriptions of
Sandinista-ruled Nicaragua as a "totalitarian dungeon" and the
contras as the "moral equivalent of the Founding Fathers."

As one NSC official told me, the campaign was modeled after
CIA covert operations abroad where a political goal is more
important than the truth. "They were trying to manipulate [U.S.]
public opinion ... using the tools of Walt Raymond's trade craft
which he learned from his career in the CIA covert operation
shop," the official admitted.

Another administration official gave a similar description to
The Miami Herald's Alfonso Chardy. "If you look at it as a whole,
the Office of Public Diplomacy was carrying out a huge
psychological operation, the kind the military conduct to
influence the population in denied or enemy territory," that
official explained.


NO QUARTER

The operation's most visible arm was a new office at the State
Department called the Office of Public Diplomacy. It was headed
by Cuban exile Otto Reich, whose job included selecting "hot
buttons" that would anger Americans about the Sandinistas. He
also browbeat correspondents who produced stories that conflicted
with the administration's "themes." Reich once bragged that his
office "did not give the critics of the policy any quarter in the
debate."

Another part of the office's job was to plant "white
propaganda" in the news media through op-eds secretly financed by
the government. In one memo, Jonathan Miller, a senior public
diplomacy official, informed White House aide Patrick Buchanan
about success placing an anti-Sandinista piece in The Wall Street
Journal's friendly pages. "Officially, this office had no role in
its preparation," Miller wrote.

Other times, the administration put out "black propaganda,"
outright falsehoods. In 1983, one such theme was designed to
anger American Jews by portraying the Sandinistas as anti-Semitic
because much of Nicaragua's small Jewish community fled after the
revolution in 1979. However, the U.S. embassy in Managua
investigated the charges and "found no verifiable ground on which
to accuse the GRN [the Sandinista government] of anti-Semitism,"
according to a July 28, 1983, cable. But the administration kept
the cable secret and pushed the "hot button" anyway.

The administration's public diplomacy also followed up on one
idea heard by the P.R. men who met with Casey in August 1983 --
to promote the theme that leftist governments would ship
narcotics to the United States. The obstacle to that argument,
however, was that the Drug Enforcement Administration knew of no
drugs which had transited Nicaragua since the Sandinistas took
power.

The reason was simple: it made little sense for traffickers to
smuggle drugs through a country with almost no trade with the
United States while the CIA was monitoring all planes leaving
Nicaraguan air space. The Reagan administration solved that P.R.
problem by arranging a "sting" operation overseen by Oliver North
and the CIA.

In 1984, convicted narcotics trafficker Barry Seal, who was
cooperating with the DEA, arranged for a plane to fly a load of
cocaine into Nicaragua. But the plane was shot down by Sandinista
air defenses. Seal then flew in a second plane, a C-123
transport. He snapped some grainy photos of men, supposedly
Nicaraguans and Colombians, loading bales of cocaine onto the
plane. Seal then flew the load back to the United States where
the story was leaked to The Washington Times and quickly spread
onto front pages across America. The desired image was achieved.


POISONING AMERICA'S YOUTH

In a TV address, President Reagan then accused top Sandinistas
of "exporting drugs to poison our youth." Even today, Seal's
photos are cited by conservative journalists to counter evidence
of cocaine smuggling by the contras, the guys in the glued-on
white hats.

Yet, in the Seal-Sandinista drug case, only one Nicaraguan, a
shadowy figure named Federico Vaughan, was ever indicted. Vaughan
supposedly worked for the Nicaraguan Interior Ministry. But
strangely, Vaughan had been calling his American drug contacts
from a phone located at either the U.S. or other Western
embassies. It was never clear for whom Vaughan was working. DEA
officials stated that they had no evidence that any other
Nicaraguan official, besides Vaughan, had participated in drug
smuggling.

The DEA also complained that the White House blew the
smuggling investigation prematurely to embarrass the Sandinistas
before a contra aid vote. The bigger fish sought by the DEA had
included the leaders of the Medellin drug cartel. But the
administration had sacrificed that probe to gain a propaganda
edge.

A year later, in 1985, the evidence would build that the
contras were engaged in real drug trafficking. In reaction, the
administration again would put P.R. ahead of law enforcement. The
public diplomacy team would activate, to attack the journalists
and investigators who revealed this evidence.

Even after the Iran-contra scandal unraveled in 1986-87 and
Casey died of brain cancer, the Republicans fought to keep secret
the remarkable story of this public diplomacy apparatus. As part
of a deal to get three moderate Republican senators to join
Democrats in signing the Iran-contra report, Democratic leaders
dropped a draft chapter on the CIA's domestic propaganda role.

The American people were thus spared the chapter's troubling
conclusion: that a covert propaganda apparatus had existed, run
by "one of the CIA's most senior specialists, sent to the NSC by
Bill Casey, to create and coordinate an inter-agency public-
diplomacy mechanism [which] did what a covert CIA operation in a
foreign country might do. [It] attempted to manipulate the media,
the Congress and public opinion to support the Reagan
administration's policies." It had succeeded.

The Media Goes to War: How TV Sold The Panama Invasion
by Mark Cook and Jeff Cohen

TWO weeks after the Panama invasion, "CBS News" sponsored a public opinion
poll in Panama that found the residents in rapture over what happened. Even
80 percent of those whose homes had been blown up or their relatives killed
by US forces said it was worth it. Their enthusiasm did not stop with the
ousting of Gen. Manual Noriega, however. A less heavily advertised result of
the poll was that 82% of the sampled Panamanian patriots did not want
Panamanian control of the Canal, preferring either partial of exclusive
control by the US ("Panamanians Strongly Back US Move," "New York Times,"
1/6/90). A "public opinion poll" in a country under martial law, conducted
by an agency obviously sanctioned by the invading forces, can be expected to
come up with such results. Most reporters, traveling as they did with the US
military, found little to contradict this picture. Less than 40 hours after
the invasion began, Sam Donaldson and Judd Rose transported us to Panama via
"ABC's Prime Time Live" (12/21/90). "There were people who applauded us as
we went by in a military convoy," said Rose. "The military have been very
good to us [in escorting reporters beyond the Canal Zone]," added Donaldson.

While this kind of "Canal Zone journalism" dominated television, a few
independent print journalists stuck out on their own. Peter Eisner of
"Newsday"'s Latin American Bureau, for example, reported (12/28/89) that
Panamanians were cursing US soldiers under their breath as troops searched
the home of a neighbor--a civilian--for weapons. One Panamanian pointed out
a man speaking to US soldiers as a "sapo" (a toad--slang for "dirty
informer") and suggested that denouncing people to the US forces was a way
of settling old scores. A doctor living on the street said that "liberals
will be laying low for a while, and they're probably justified" because of
what would happen to those who speak out. All of Eisner's sources feared
having their names printed.

The same day's "Miami Herald" ran articles about Panamanian citizen
reactions, including concern over the hundreds of dead civilians: "Neighbors
saw six US truck loads bringing dozens of bodies" to a mass grave. As a
mother watched the body of her soldier son lowered into a grave, her "voice
rose over the crowd's silence: `Damn the Americans.'"

Obviously there was a mix of opinion inside Panama, but it was virtually
unreported on television, the dominant medium shaping US attitudes about the
invasion. Panamanian opposition to the US was dismissed as nothing more than
"DigBat [Dignity Battalion] thugs" who'd been given jobs by Noriega. And it
was hardly acknowledged that the high-visibility demonstration outside the
Vatican Embassy the day of Noriega's surrender had been actively
"encouraged" by the US occupying forces ("Newsday," 1/5/90).

Few TV reporters seemed to notice that the jubilant Panamanians parading
before their cameras day after day to endorse the invasion spoke
near-perfect English and were overwhelmingly light-skinned and well-dressed.
This in a Spanish-speaking country with a largely mestizo and black
population where poverty is widespread. "ABC"'s Beth Nissen (12/27/89) was
one of the few TV reporters to take a close look at the civilian deaths
caused by US bombs that pulverized El Chorillo, the poor neighborhood which
ambulance drivers now call "Little Hiroshima." The people of El Chorillo
don't speak perfect English, and they were less than jubilant about the
invasion.

"Our Boys" vs. Unseen Civilians

In the first days of the invasion, TV journalists had one overriding
obsession: How many American soldiers have died? The question, repeated with
drumbeat regularity, tended to drown out the other issues: Panamanian
casualties, international law, foreign reaction. On the morning of the
invasion, "CBS" anchor Kathleen Sullivan's voice cracked with emotion for
the US soldiers: "Nine killed, more than 50 wounded. How long can this
fighting go on?" Unknown and unknowable to "CBS" viewers, hundreds of
Panamanians had already been killed by then, many buried in their homes.

Judging from the calls and requests for interviews that poured into the FAIR
office, European and Latin American journalists based in the US were stunned
by the implied racism and national chauvinism in the media display. The
"Toronto Globe and Mail," often referred to as the "New York Times" of
Canada, ran a front-page article (12/22/89) critiquing the United States and
its media for "the peculiar jingoism of US society so evident to foreigners
but almost invisible for most Americans."

TV's continuous focus on the well-being of the invaders, and not the
invadees, meant that the screen was dominated by red, white and blue draped
coffins and ceremonies, honor rolls of the US dead, drum rolls, remarks by
Dan Rather (12/21/89) about "our fallen heroes"...but no Panamanian
funerals. This despite the fact that the invasion claimed perhaps 50
Panamanian lives for every US citizen killed.

When Pentagon pool correspondent Fred Francis was asked on day one about
civilian casualties on "ABC's Nightline" (12/20/89), he said he did not
know, because he and other journalists were traveling around with the US
army. Curiosity didn't increase in ensuing days. FAIR called the TV networks
daily to demand they address the issue of civilian deaths, but journalists
said they had no way of verifying the numbers.

No such qualms existed with regards to Rumania, where over the Christmas
weekend "CNN" and other US outlets were freely dishing out fantastic reports
of 80,000 people killed in days of violence, a figure--greater that the
immediate Hiroshima death toll--which any editor should have dismissed out
of hand. Tom Brokaw's selective interest in civilians was evident when he
devoted the first half of "NBC Nightly News" (12/20/89) to Panama without
mentioning non- combatant casualties, then turned to Rumania and immediately
referred to reports of thousands of civilian deaths.

Not until the sixth day of the Panama invasion did the US Army augment its
estimated dead (23 American troops, 297 alleged enemy soldiers) to include a
figure for civilians: 254. The number was challenged as representing only a
fraction of the true death toll by the few reporters who sought out
independent sources: Panamanian human rights monitors, hospital workers,
ambulance drivers, funeral home directors. These sources also spoke of
thousands of civilian injuries and 10,000 left homeless. Many journalists,
especially on television, were too busy cheerleading "the successful
military action" to notice the Panamanians who didn't fare so successfully.

TV correspondents, so uncurious about civilian casualties, could not be
expected to go beyond US military assurances about who was being arrested
and why. As the "Boston Globe" noted (1/1/90), US forces were arresting
anyone on a blacklist compiled by the newly-installed government.
"Newsday"'s Peter Eisner reported (1/7/90): "Hundreds of intellectuals,
university students, teachers and professional people say they have been
harassed and detained by US forces in the guise of searching for hidden
weapons."

The "Objective" Reporter's Lexicon: We, Us, Our

In covering the invasion, many TV journalists abandoned even the pretense of
operating in a neutral, independent mode. Television anchors used pronouns
like "we" and "us" in describing the mission into Panama, as if they
themselves were members of the invasion force, or at least helpful advisors.
"NBC"'s Brokaw exclaimed, on day one: "We haven't got [Noriega] yet." "CNN"
anchor Mary Anne Loughlin asked a former CIA official (12/21/89): "Noriega
has stayed one step ahead of us. Do you think we'll be able to find him?"
After eagerly quizzing a panel of US military experts on "MacNeil/Lehrer"
(12/21/89) about whether "we" had wiped out the Panamanian Defense Forces
(PDF), Judy Woodruff concluded, "So not only have we done away with the PDF,
we've also done away with the police force." So much for the separation of
press and state.

Ted Koppel and other TV journalists had a field day mocking the
Orwellianly-titled "Dignity Battalions," but none were heard ridiculing the
invasion's code-name: "Operation Just Cause." The day after the invasion,
"NBC Nightly News" offered its own case study in Orwellian Newspeak: While
one correspondent referred to the US military occupiers as engaging in
"peacekeeping chores," another correspondent on the same show referred to
Latin American diplomats at the OAS condemning the US as a "lynch mob."
After the Soviet Union criticized the invasion as "gunboat diplomacy" (as
had many other countries), Dan Rather dismissed it as "old-line, hard-line
talk from Moscow" ("CBS Evening News," 12/20/89).

Journalism gave way to state propaganda when a "CNN" correspondent dutifully
reported on the day of the invasion: "US troops have taken detainees but we
are not calling them `prisoners of war' because the US has not declared
war." (That kind of obedient reporter probably still refers to the Vietnam
"conflict.") Similarly, on Day 1, many networks couldn't bring themselves to
call the invasion an invasion until they got the green light from
Washington: instead, it was referred to variously as a military action,
intervention, operation, expedition, affair, insertion.

Where Did Our Love Go?

Many reporters uncritically promoted White House explanations for its
break-up with Noriega. Clifford Krauss reported ("NY Times," 1/21/90) that
Noriega "began as a CIA asset but fell afoul of Washington over his
involvement in drug and arms trafficking." "ABC"'s Peter Jennings told
viewers on the day of the invasion, "Let's remember that the United States
was very close to Mr. Noriega before the whole question of drugs came up."
Actually, Noriega's drug links were asserted by US intelligence as early as
1972. In 1976, after US espionage officials proposed that Noriega be dumped
because of drugs and double-dealing, then-CIA director George Bush made sure
the relationship continued ("S.F. Examiner," 1/5/90; "New Yorker," 1/8/90).
US intelligence overlooked the drug issue year after year as long as Noriega
was an eager ally in US espionage and covert operations, especially those
targeted against Nicaragua.

Peter Jennings' claim that the US broke with Noriega after the "question of
drugs came up" turns reality upside down. Noriega's involvement in drug
trafficking was purportedly heaviest in the early 1980s when his
relationship with the US was especially close. By 1986, when the Noriega/US
relationship began to fray, experts agree that Noriega had already
drastically curtailed his drug links. The two drug-related indictments
against Noriega in Florida cover activities from 1981 through March 1986
("Analysts Challenge View of Noriega as Drug Lord," "Washington Post,"
1/7/90).

When, as vice president, Bush met with Noriega in Panama in December 1983,
besides discussing Nicaragua, Bush allegedly raised questions about drug
money laundering. According to author Kevin Buckley, Noriega told top aide
Jose Blandon that he'd picked up the following message from the Bush
meeting: "The United States wanted help for the contras so badly that if he
even promised it, the US government would turn a blind eye to
money-laundering and setbacks to democracy in Panama." In 1985 and '86,
Noriega met several times with Oliver North to discuss the assistance
Noriega was providing to the contras, such as training contras at Panamanian
Defense Force bases ("Noriega could give some interesting answers," Kevin
Buckley, "St. Petersburg Times," 1/3/90). Noriega didn't fall from grace
until he stopped being a "team player" in the US war against Nicaragua.

Democracy had as little to do with the break-up as drugs. If Noriega
believed Bush had given his strongarm rule a green light in 1983,
confirmation came the next year when Noriega's troops seized ballot boxes
and blatantly rigged Panama's presidential election. Noriega's candidate,
Nicolas Ardito Barletta, was also "our" candidate--an economist who had been
a student and assistant to former University of Chicago professor George
Shultz. Though loudly protested by Panamanians, the fraud that put Ardito
Barletta in power was cheered by the US Embassy. Secretary of State Shultz
attended his inauguration. (See "The Press on Panama," "Extra!", Mar/Apr 88;
Richard Reeves, "San Francisco Chronicle," 12/25/89)

As the Noriega case progresses toward trial, the media's treatment of key
witnesses against the General may offer a case study in bias. Several of the
witnesses have already testified on these matters in a very public
forum--hearings before Senator John Kerry's Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on
Narcotics. At that time, February 1988, they fingered Nicaraguan contras as
cocaine cohorts of Noriega operating under the umbrella of the CIA and Ollie
North. The hearings were ignored or distorted by national media outlets,
with Reagan/Bush officials and CIA dismissing the witnesses as drug
trafficking felons. ("Extra!," Mar/Apr 88; Warren Hinckle, "S.F. Examiner,"
1/11/90). In a predictable turnaround, as soon as Noriega was apprehended,
TV news brought forth experts to explain that "when one prosecutes someone
like Noriega for drug dealing, witnesses will of necessity be drug dealers."

Provocations of Pretexts?

The US media showed little curiosity about the Dec. 16 confrontation that
led to the death of a US Marine officer and the injury of another when they
tried to run a roadblock in front of the PDF headquarters. The officers were
supposedly "lost." In view of what is now known about the intense
pre-invasion preparations then underway ("NY Times," 12/24/89), is it
possible the Marines were actually trying to track Noriega's whereabouts?

The Panamanian version of the event was that the US soldiers, upon being
discovered, opened fire--injuring three civilians, including a child--and
then tried to run the roadblock. This version was largely ignored by US
journalists even after the shooting two days later of a Panamanian corporal
who "signaled a US serviceman to stop," according to the administration.
"The US serviceman felt threatened," the administration claimed, after
admitting that its earlier story that the Panamanian had pulled his gun was
false ("NYT," 12/19/89)

As for the claim that a US officer had been roughly interrogated and his
wife had been sexually threatened, the administration provided no supporting
evidence ("NYT," 12/19/89; "Newsday," 12/18/89). Since the Marine's death
and the interrogation were repeatedly invoked to justify the invasion, the
lack of press scrutiny of these claims is stunning.

For months, US forces had been trying to provoke confrontations as a pretext
for an attack. In response to an Aug. 11 incident, Panamanian Foreign
Minister Jorge Ritter asked that a UN peacekeeping force be dispatched to
Panama to prevent such encounters. The US press largely ignored his call
("El Diario/La Prensa," New York's Spanish-language daily, 8/13/89).

The "Declaration of War" That Never Was

"When during the past few days [Noriega] declared war on the United States
and some of his followers then killed a US Marine, roughed up another
American serviceman, also threatening that man's wife, strong public support
for a reprisal was all but guaranteed," Ted Koppel told his "Nightline"
audience Dec. 20.

Noriega never "declared war on the United States." The original "Reuters"
dispatches, published on the inside pages of the "New York Times"
(12/17-18/89), buried the supposed "declaration" in articles dealing with
other matters. In the Dec. 17 article headlined, "Opposition Leader in
Panama Rejects a Peace Offer from Noriega," "Reuters" quoted the general as
saying that he would judiciously use new powers granted to him by the
Panamanian parliament and that "the North American scheme, through constant
psychological and military harassment, has created a state of war in
Panama." This statement of fact aroused little excitement at the White
House, which called the parliament's move "a hollow step."

The day after the invasion, "Los Angeles Times" Pentagon correspondent
Melissa Healey told a call-in talk show audience on "C- SPAN" that Noriega
had "declared war" on the United States. When a caller asked why that hadn't
been front page news, Healey explained that the declaration of war was one
of a series of "incremental escalations." When another caller pointed out
that Panama had only made a rhetorical statement that US economic and other
measures had created a state of war, the Pentagon correspondent confessed
ignorance of what had actually been said, and suggested that it was
certainly worth investigating.

The incident symbolizes media performance on the invasion--dispense official
information as gospel first, worry about the truth of that information
later. It's just what the White House was counting on from the media. The
Bush team set out to control television and front page news in the first
days knowing that exposes of official deception (such as Noriega's 110
pounds of "cocaine" that turned out to be tamales) would not appear until
weeks later buried on inside pages of newspapers. Rulers do not require the
total suppression of news. As Napoleon Bonaparte once said: It's sufficient
to delay the news until it no longer matters.

Besides uncritically dispensing huge quantities of official news and views,
the TV networks had another passion during the first days of the invasion:
polling their public. It was an insular process, with predictable results. A
"Toronto Globe and Mail" news story summarized it (12/22/89): "Hardly a
voice of objection is being heard within the United States about the Panama
invasion, at least from those deemed as official sources and thus likely to
be seen on television or read in the papers. Not surprisingly, given the
media coverage, a television poll taken yesterday by one network ("CNN")
indicated that nine of ten viewers approved of the invasion."

Of deadlines, dead leads - and death
Foreign correspondents, especially Americans, face increasing danger

02/10/2002

By CAROLYN BARTA / The Dallas Morning News


Covering wars has always been dangerous, but journalists are increasingly
becoming targets.

Correspondents are granted no immunity because of their profession. And
American journalists - with mounting global terrorism and anti-Americanism -
risk being snatched as political pawns.

"American journalists are no longer considered noncombatants. At one time
they were considered like the Red Cross," said Stephen Hess, a Brookings
Institution scholar and author of the book International News and Foreign
Correspondents.

The recent kidnapping of Daniel Pearl, a Wall Street Journal correspondent
in Pakistan, brought that fact home.

A few years ago, extremists might have kidnapped an American corporate
executive or bombed a diplomat. Now they go after a journalist. "It's part
of the anti-American feeling in the world and [the feeling that] journalists
are not objective professionals who are 'above country,' " Mr. Hess said.

Last year was particularly deadly for foreign correspondents, with eight
killed in Afghanistan. And Pakistan has long been considered a dangerous
place for local journalists to practice. But news organizations remain
committed to covering the region.

"Everyone is staying put for the moment," said Abi Wright, spokeswoman for
the Committee to Protect Journalists, although the Pearl kidnapping may have
a "chilling effect" on coverage. "Though reporters haven't left the country,
that's not to say they're venturing out from their hotels as much as they
would have."

When he was kidnapped, Mr. Pearl was investigating the link between a
militant group and Richard Reid, the shoe-bomber suspect. A former Pakistani
reporter predicts the kidnapping will affect other Western journalists.

"It will probably discourage them from trying to get too close to their
sources," said Nafisa Hoodbyoy, who worked for the English-language
newspaper, Dawn, and now teaches at the University of Massachusetts.

Dr. Anantha Babbili, a journalism professor at Texas Christian University
who was a reporter in India, said, "Every time a journalist is put in danger
or taken hostage or becomes a bargaining chip, it inhibits fellow reporters,
not only reporters from abroad but those native to the country."

While the focus now is on Pakistan and Afghanistan, every year, dozens of
journalists are killed worldwide. More than 100 are in jail or captivity.

In 2001, the CPJ reports, 37 journalists were killed worldwide, an increase
from 2000 when 24 were killed. The war in Afghanistan produced the highest
death toll for a single country since 1999, when 10 journalists were killed
in Sierra Leone.

But 1994, when 72 journalists were killed, was the deadliest year because of
the war in Bosnia and the targeting of journalists by Islamic
fundamentalists in Algeria.

Ms. Wright, whose organization documents press freedom abuses worldwide,
said local journalists are targeted more often than Westerners. Many are
covering endemic conflicts or criminal activity, such as drug wars.

Still, conflicts across the globe and the spread of terrorism is causing
news organizations to promote safety measures, urge caution and, in some
cases, reassess how they deploy their people.

But most correspondents view risk as part of the job.

In a New York Times opinion piece, Terry Anderson, an Associated Press
reporter captured 16 years ago and held hostage for seven years in Lebanon,
wrote: "Journalists in this dangerous world are very aware of our
vulnerability. To cover the news, we have to be in the midst of it."

David Filipov, the Boston Globe's Moscow bureau chief, was asked during a
PBS interview how he felt about going back to Afghanistan after covering the
war there from October to Christmas.

"Well, I don't plan to buy real estate there, but I'll continue covering it
as long as it's a story," he said. "That's what I do. It's my job."

During October and November, at the height of the war in Afghanistan, 1,500
foreign correspondents were in Pakistan, using it as a launching pad for war
coverage. It was the largest concentration of international media since the
Gulf War, according to Reporters Without Borders, a Paris-based organization
that estimates that 300 to 400 remain.

"At the beginning of almost any kind of conflict, you don't know what the
rules are. That's when people get hurt," said Michael Parks, a foreign
correspondent for 25 years who is interim director of the University of
Southern California's journalism school

"It's not correspondents being foolhardy, but they have nothing to guide
them. So you wind up crossing lines when you think you're safe. That's what
happened with the correspondents in Afghanistan. They took risks they
thought were acceptable."

Four journalists and their Afghan guide were ambushed and murdered on Nov.
19 as they drove on a deserted stretch of road between Jalalabad and Kabul.
The week before, three reporters traveling were killed by Taliban fire.
Another cameraman was robbed, shot and killed in a house where he was
staying.

No Americans were killed. But they could have been.

The journalists murdered Nov. 19 were in an eight-vehicle convoy. The other
vehicles included journalists from The Washington Post, the Los Angeles
Times and The Baltimore Sun, who were able to turn back.

Jim Wooten writes in the current issue of Columbia Journalism Review that
his ABC News crew was only three minutes behind the victims' cars and turned
back after encountering a car returning from the murder scene.

"The driver's arm was out the window, waving frantically, apparently
flagging us down. As we passed, I saw him draw his finger across his
throat," Mr. Wooten said. The car's driver yelled, "Ambush, ambush," and
said journalists had been killed. Mr. Wooten recalled that a local adviser
had told him the previous day that the road was safe.

Mr. Hess said that while war correspondence has always been dangerous,
Afghanistan has presented special problems.

"It's not like World War II, where there were battlelines, and people had
uniforms," he said. Nor like the Gulf War, where journalists were assigned
to a unit so they had some protection from American troops.

The country also is flush with bandits, drawn to journalists who are
"walking ATM machines. The only way to do it was to go in there with your
pockets stuffed with cash," he said.

Still, reporters are drawn by the adventure and the chance to get the story.
"Your blood pulses, being there," Mr. Hess said.

Many of the reporters and photographers who go into war zones or dangerous
situations are young free-lancers, trying to make a name for themselves.
They often take more risks to get the story.

But it's also a way to advance a career. "It's how you move ahead and win
Pulitzer prizes and go on to be editor," Mr. Hess said.

Mr. Parks, who became editor of the Los Angeles Times before he became an
educator, had covered Vietnam, Iran during the revolution, Lebanon during
the civil war and South Africa during the uprising against apartheid.

"It was important for me to see as much as I could at the front lines.
That's where the conflict is and where best to understand what is driving
it," he said. "The only way to cover this kind of news is to get out there."

Editors understand the urgency of being on the scene but are stressing
caution in the wake of the Pearl kidnapping.

"We asked each person in the region to 'think security' in every reporting
decision they make - which sources they meet and under what circumstances
and which parts of Pakistan to travel to," said Mary Braswell, deputy
foreign editor at the Los Angeles Times.

Gilbert Bailon, executive editor of The Dallas Morning News, said The News
is not withdrawing its journalists from the region, "though we have
increased efforts to secure them as they travel about. They stay in frequent
communication and are rotated out."

All are veteran journalists; most of the reporters are based abroad. They
work as a team with photographers from Dallas "and know that their safety
comes before any story," he said.

As for why the newspaper is keeping them in the field, he said, "In addition
to the military conflict, there is a compelling story of the rebuilding of a
destitute country and the people who live there."

Unfortunately, he said, "reporters around the world are harassed, jailed and
sometimes assaulted or even killed. It didn't start with Daniel Pearl nor
will it end with his capture. But it is very sobering when a U.S. journalist
doing his job is the target of terrorists."

Tom Kent, a deputy managing editor of the Associated Press in New York, said
the world has been dangerous for foreign correspondents particularly since
the end of the Cold War, because conflicts have frequently involved
separatist fights and guerilla groups.

The wire service offers safety training for its reporters and photographers,
as do other major media outlets such as the British Broadcasting
Corporation, Agence France-Presse and Reuters. It also equips those in
danger zones with flak jackets and helmets and uses armor-plated vehicles in
some parts of the world.

The AP has a worldwide force of 400 to 500 involved in newsgathering. "We
always tell them, when in doubt, don't go forward," Mr. Kent said. Yet, in
its 150-year history, AP has had 26 correspondents killed, including five
World War II correspondents.

Mr. Parks said Pakistan will continue to be a hot spot for news, because of
tensions with India and its importance to the United States.

Newspapers and networks have to tell that story with correspondents and
crews on the ground, he said. "You can't cover from London."

With terrorism becoming a threat in many parts of the globe, he said, "our
readers, viewers, listeners want to know, need to know what's driving the
terrorism, how can it be controlled, how can it be fought. The question is
how to do it well, and how to do it safely."

The Media Column: War journalists should not be cosying up to the military
By Robert Fisk
21 January 2003


It looks like a rerun of the 1991 Gulf War. Already American journalists are
fighting like tigers to join "the pool", to be "embedded" in the US military
so that they can see the war at first hand - and, of course, be censored.
Eleven years ago, they turned up at Dhahran in Saudi Arabia, already kitted
out with helmets, gas capes, chocolate rations and eyes that narrowed when
they looked into the sun, just like General Montgomery. Half the reporters
wanted to wear military costume and one young television man from the
American mid-west turned up, I recall well, with a pair of camouflaged
boots. Each boot was camouflaged with painted leaves. Those of us who had
been in a desert -- even those who had only seen a picture of a desert - did
wonder what this meant.

Well, of course, it symbolised fantasy, the very quality upon which most
viewers now rely when watching "live" war - or watching death "live" on TV.

Thus, over the past four weeks, the massed ranks of American television
networks have been pouring into Kuwait to cosy up to the US military, to
seek those coveted "pool" positions, to try on their army or marine costumes
and make sure that - if or when the day comes - they will have the kind of
coverage that every reporter and every general wants: a few facts, good
pictures and nothing dirty to make the viewers throw up on the breakfast
table. I remember how, back in 1991, only those Iraqi soldiers obliging
enough to die in romantic poses - arm thrown back to conceal the decomposing
features or face down and anonymous in the sand - made it on to live-time.
Those soldiers turned into a crematorium nightmare or whose corpses were
being torn to pieces by wild dogs - I actually saw an ITV crew film this
horrific scene - were not honoured on screen. ITV's film, of course,
couldn't be shown - lest it persuade the entire world that no one should go
to war, ever, again.

The Americans are actually using the word "embedded". Reporters must be
"embedded' in military units. The fears of Central Command at Tampa,
Florida, are that Saddam will commit some atrocity - a gas attack on
Shiites, an air bombardment of Iraqi civilians - and then blame it on the
Americans. Journalists in the "pool" can thus be rushed to the scene to
prove that the killings were the dastardly work of the Beast of Baghdad
rather than the "collateral damage" - the Distinguished Medal for
Gutlessness should be awarded to all journalists who even mention this
phrase - of the fine young men who are trying to destroy the triple pillar
of the "axis of evil".

Already, the "buddy-buddy" relationship - that's actually what the Ministry
of Defence boys called it 11 years ago -- has started. US troops in Kuwait
are offering courses in chemical and biological warfare for reporters who
might be accompanying soldiers to "the front", along with "training" on the
need to protect security during military operations. CNN is, of course,
enthusiastically backing these seemingly innocuous courses - forgetting how
they allowed Pentagon "trainees" to sit in their newsroom during the 1991
Gulf War.

So here's a thumbnail list of how to watch out for mendacity and propaganda
on your screen once Gulf War Two (or Three if you include the 1980-88
Iran-Iraq conflict) begins. You should suspect the following:

Reporters who wear items of American or British military costume - helmets,
camouflage jackets, weapons, etc.

Reporters who say "we" when they are referring to the US or British military
unit in which they are "embedded".

Those who use the words "collateral damage" instead of "dead civilians".

Those who commence answering questions with the words: "Well, of course,
because of military security I can't divulge..." Those who, reporting from
the Iraqi side, insist on referring to the Iraqi population as "his" (ie
Saddam's) people.

Journalists in Baghdad who refer to "what the Americans describe as Saddam
Hussein's human rights abuses" - rather than the plain and simple torture we
all know Saddam practices.

Journalists reporting from either side who use the god-awful and creepy
phrase "officials say" without naming, quite specifically, who these often
lying "officials" are.

Stay tuned.

Gabe, Patrick --

There was more than a little consciousness of insane, oxymoronish language
in the Vietnam war -- the Fugs' "Kill, Kill, Kill for Peace" comes to mind
-- but two recent such instances seem emblematic.

What exactly does it mean when the President warns journalists to get out of
Iraq? I mean . . . isn't it their *job* to tell the rest of us what's going
on? Didn't there used to be some cachet to being a war correspondent? What
exactly does it mean when an NPR correspondent from Iraq today said "Well,
this might be the last you hear from me for awhile, because there'll be
restrictions on what I can say now" -- and there is NO QUESTION about it?
Why do we go on crediting -- in ANY WAY -- what mainstream journalism is
going to tell us when it's so OBVIOUSLY censored?

There's no end to the horror and inanity of what's about to go down, but . .
. was anyone else bothered when Colin Powell said "the time for diplomacy
was over"? I mean . . . he's the Secretary of State -- isn't diplomacy his
*job*? If the time for diplomacy is over, Colin, then shouldn't you QUIT
YOUR JOB?? If I'd been in charge of the miserable diplomacy that this
country has exhibited in the last few months, I would have resigned. Why
doesn't Colin?

In the meantime, there's a gristly picture on the back cover of the latest
*Adbusters* magazine that will, I'm afraid, be repeated some thousand fold
in the next few days.

I'm flying to New York City tomorrow, where I hope to meet with some
distinguished contributors to this listserv and demonstrate, in any number
of ways, my revulsion to current events. In the meantime, I suggest that we
all do our jobs, and by so doing, expose the cretinous public servants who
aren't doing theirs.

One of the most affecting and memorable images of the twentieth century was
a newspaper photo depicting an American soldier putting a Vietnamese hut
aflame with a cigarette lighter. One of the most powerful current political
activities happening against this war at this moment is Paul Chan's project
of posting photos of Iraqis around New York. I was excited by Patrick
Herron's post below concerning Peter Turnley's impressive ideas and
suggestions concerning the political power of photography.

Good Day
That we were both our first gesture and in the early morning toward =
arms, making torsos lift from the blue sheets, that we were both cold, =
could allow for a large enough frame to include a map of the furnace =
clicking awake throughout the night. You said: "it's seven am and I have =
to run." Somewhere vials fill clear, their liquid suggests an =
effervescence beyond simply what an alligator might accomplish as an =
ambulance operator. And my own eyes, for their purpose, chose to collect =
other bodies (WO I might add) from the shapes that spackle our ceiling. =
Ambulatory clouds cover sense. Yet it is only a moment that waits to =
occur. And after you've read it, maybe such things did. Find is in the =
glove, the finger's occupation, as much as in the word 'trouver'. Some =
roots for discover land them into a perpetual deathcycle for two more =
lines, two feet, a meter. Strike accord in opulence. Beauty rests, and =
finally, thank god, in the ice of the bell holder. When it does, the =
shatter startles us out of a momentary reverie, it is after all an early =
morning, and as suddenly as the things shiver, they fetter awareness to =
its own balloon, filling our minds with a body, our body with an idea of =
itself and its opposite, and filling its opposite with the desire for =
some coffee, the newspaper, some golden or glass slippers.=20

Good Day

When tall boots don't stuff ice, put a t into the cross. A fool for the =
fire down below. Blindness before beauty. Convention appoints, =
disappears into footsteps upstairs, stems into conversation with the =
other half of the centaur. Watch convex gifts that resemble the moon, =
aren't but seem to be at least 'worldly' uprooted. Starcrost dramatiste =
falls in love, aristocratically, falls from the sky, and you say: "It =
snows. Or at least Benveniste swallowed by apostrophes." Or maybe you =
said: "His soul swooned slowly as he heard the snow falling faintly =
through the universe and faintly falling, like the descent of their last =
end, upon all the living and the dead." But that could have also been =
the tables as they turned. A wild card between the light blue sheets, =
these pages, those kingly decisions, generations I imagine being just a =
moment before midnight.

Good Afternoon

Once it has passed upon a time, cloaked Wagner, quick institute bellows =
our youngsters, gifted or otherwise accidental. No one was badly hurt. =
Control blasts across the room and the weather chinooks it should be =
said. Beasts rifle the pages and further blue on blue aphasia. How come =
your legs work. Against understanding in such plain talk as this. Rooms =
move past confederate canadians, evolution beyond mourning: one against =
many should reveal itself as a construct and therefore false; a storm =
out of nowhere, see how semi-colons work, that is, a reading...

Good Day

Spin it clicks awake, and the blue as in sheets, rewind, that it said =
humble returns, eternally yours, and the kerning got all fucked up so =
fast between us. The US and the rest. That's them's the breaks I guess. =
This windows platform expertise makes lines break, little green hashes =
advance up the column till they drive from dark green, evergreen, =
central intelligence to red, bright red, with a little element to heat =
it all up at the center, between the screens. A several thing. =
Multifold. Many are folded into a discussion of kitchen sinks and their =
relationship to contemporary poetry, the porcelain wasn't always =
nontoxic. Who doesn't have a problematic relationship to such an =
overwhelming colonizing force? The english language? What we do is =
squat, rent some ideas, turn the sound down, enliven. The green movement =
against the whalers. Interviews would suggest that even the grass is fed =
up with growth because of the latent incorporation of so many natural =
metaphors by business. The fundamentals changed teams. Damn carpet =
pulled itself out from under my feet. To sleep at some point later. Find =
William Carlos Williams' Pictures from Cavanaugh under my pillow since =
my girlfriend has a group project on his poem the fall of mike harris. =
It goes unnoticed. Bellows in the annals of history. While the market =
seems to be on an upward swing. Technologies on the front lines aching =
for just a few more feet of desert. In advance.=20

Good Day

Online chess again suffers my shoulder after hours while some kid keeps =
his queen stuck out before his advance. Just there and he thinks he's =
going to clean up all my pieces. Maybe that seemed to work in other =
games. "The". Ergonomics has changed everything into a new standard. Our =
ergonomic language, user friendly, easy on the back. -developer. =
Beautiful glossy covers flown into Calgary first and foremost on the =
crest of the last chinook, which literally washed all of the grey out of =
our afternoons. Tuesday the sixth of May back in ninety-seven. I =
"suppose" it wouldn't matter anyway what was recorded, posted, blogged, =
universalized and several lawnmowers fire up at once from thirteenth to =
fourteenth which is really a small stretch of street. These sounds offer =
into the air a kind of second to none, critical intelligence about the =
fear of the road at the end of the walkway. Or fears. That war. Or =
roads. This is not a poem that scratches its own boundaries. =
".../poetics.edu.com/childrenofthewar.html." If you think you are =
strange. Check. The collective symbolic, eh? Soft voice goes online from =
the crowd. History into the fold. Periods of weather shift and carry =
information across the country of birthdays, memories, hopes, and the =
cheat of defamiliarization. Spell check doesn't recognize =
defamiliarization and I can't really blame it for hoping my paragraphs =
don't drift too far from grammatical correctness, after all it is =
preprogrammed, it is in anticipation of foregone conclusions. These =
words are situated on the edge of the evening. As time folds over into =
the night. While car doors slam toward A & A, toward 20th. Someone on =
the LRT said numbers "were just information". Well, I guess she was =
right. I scratched it into a notebook with one of those old blue =
papermate pens, from before the war. She rode the train from Fish Creek =
to 3rd street station. I might have asked her what she meant by saying =
that, but she seemed to be so entirely certain of her statement that it =
didn't seem to matter much what she meant. And she said it really loudly =
too. "Yellow Poems." They float on the air too. And sometimes fall just =
like snow. But don't eat them.

Good Day

When I woke up today. The phone rang. My friend said you can't use the =
word punctilious in a poem. It has certainly been thirty-one mondays =
since we last discussed Stompin'. That it was the phone when it rang. =
What I've been trying to say. Is that you can't use the word poem in a =
poem. Or over the phone early in the morning; that certain prisoners are =
or once were our friends, bastards, themselves outshined by the sun, =
even the sun that now shines through my bedroom window, past the little =
bonsai leaves and rubber alligator, over the blue sheets, the dark blue =
sheets, the dark blue sheets which you have pulled up over your head and =
it is at least seven am. Punctilious.

Good Day

Manners matter mostly to muttering mothers on Mondays. My mother. It was =
around this time that her mother died from complications that arose =
during some 'minor' surgery. My grandmother. Chrome graves risen, stand =
the blades of grass above them stiff; caught in the wind that also moves =
the elm's leaves high above. Scarborough to Capitol Hill. A granite key =
between the lines on my front door for you to let yourself in, and in =
hindsight you made breakfast before I even got out of bed around noon. =
That sentence is dead. Money is information. Water doesn't have a =
wallet. Or a shed. Like language. You said to be patient and I probably =
muttered something like I will if you are the doctor. If I could go =
back, I'd make breakfast before you got to my place, and I'd also most =
likely not say that thing about you being a doctor. It is all economics =
at our feet, the rubble of war over the airwaves, where I discover even =
you have succumbed to the dynamics of pressure, water wears down, =
erodes, new lines of slight, it builds on all of our shoulders, that =
snow as if flakes to the ground again, through that goddamned =
streetlight that slipped itself right into the poem by virtue, by virtue =
of it having no idea about the war, or about this poem, or about the =
fact it is unnatural; a mockery even of the UN in all of its patience. =
Standing tall out of the clouds, those clouds that roll across the =
ocean, charging steeds, steelheads billows sails out front over wild =
drops, deep wells between the waves, deep wells somewhere and then gone. =
Gone just as fast between the ebb and flow of what my mother said the =
other day about leaving her last husband; the graveyard is the brightest =
landmark back home, in Milton. Then there's the wind again. You find the =
key between the lines at my front door, let yourself in, and to my =
belated surprise make blueberry pancakes, some coffee, wake me softly =
out of a deep sleep asking whether or not I slept well through the =
night, through the storms..

Good Day

Prior to noon scramble, our yellow fingers find such tangled brown hair =
soft as feathers beneath the sheets that for one second we fear the =
presence of ravens. As though our pillows split open. And emptied ink =
into the air, we thought coffee aromatized as the eventual limit for =
vocabulary despite the fact it hasn't happened in days. Such was the =
luminosity of the glow in the dark paint you smeared all over the =
mirror. When we say it glowed, that's precisely what we're trying to =
say. The birds could whistle if we would let them, remove the elastic =
bands from their beaks. And plant those trees again, the cedar shrubs, =
just outside the window.

Red alert? Stay home, await word

Sunday, March 16, 2003

By TOM BALDWIN
Gannett State Bureau
TRENTON

If the nation escalates to "red alert," which is the highest in the
color-coded readiness against terror, you will be assumed by authorities
to
be the enemy if you so much as venture outside your home, the state's
anti-terror czar says.

"This state is on top of it," said Sid Caspersen, New Jersey's director
of
the office of counter-terrorism.

Caspersen, a former FBI agent, was briefing reporters, alongside Gov.
James
E. McGreevey, on Thursday, when for the first time he disclosed the
realities of how a red alert would shut the state down.

A red alert would also tear away virtually all personal freedoms to move

about and associate.

"Red means all noncritical functions cease," Caspersen said.
"Noncritical
would be almost all businesses, except health-related."

A red alert means there is a severe risk of terrorist attack, according
to
federal guidelines from the Department of Homeland Security.

I am preparing an selective antholgy of Turkish poetry for Talisman which is
going to be published this year. It deals very closely with your question.
Turkish poetry creates an incredibly nuanced writing partly using the
repetivive, agglutidunal nature quality of the language. I calledthis
quality, also related to Sufism, "eda."

Perhaps the single poet now translated in English is Orhan Veli. In its
deceptive simplicity the cadences I am referring to come across. I translated
Orhan Veli in "I, Orhan Veli," by Hanging Loose press in New York. It can be
bought through Amazon. also, the poem I think is in somebody's web site in
its entirety.

Here are a few other examples by other poets:


            The Wall

The power
Power
Of seeing you
In pigtails
In pigtails,
The plain skirt
Of your school uniform
Around your hips,
Sweat
Against the wall
Against your wish
Against the wall
Against your wish.



            Miss Kinar's Waters

She cried the smile of pebble stones with the raki from the carafe
from Miss Kinar now who became water to steep wells
with her straight hair what can she do in the theatre houses of
Shehzadehbashi
she could not have enough hats

This bald Hassan, this baldie swept the darkness
his rebellious cigarette lit backwards to avoid any laughter
and a police enters fairy tales which go on ever since
parting the human eyelashes of children

And gathered inside her the sadness of the hands of an oud
playing woman, appeared suddenly into wells in the evenings crying
from Miss Kinar's waters.              (Ece Ayhan)



            Wall Street

This walking reluctantly
pitch thought night hatless
a spiritual money exchange spinning out
sterling dollars, hard cash
cruising reluctantly this pervasive bruising

a whipped body's recline - against weeping willow
window sockets blind to this stretched pleasure
a rationale smoking why, stripped naked, stripped this body
was whipped up - glorified morning

I returning home
below sea level, a routed team
put back my lapin gloves into the closet
wiping my sole on the stoop before crossing in

tonight I shall propose your turn to beat me
a finite stretch of time the windows of Wall Street dark for eons -
infinity marries in mourning
my civil service pocket watch is running up

my lapin gloves must be returned

tonight convert symmetry into seduction
in this soft side street -walled street- my body will be fasting
this lemon moony skin deserves a good beating
without beating this lemon moon is not possible


a psychic omelet I'll

emerging out of reluctant infinitudes, crossing the threshhold
wiping my shoes on the stoop, hatless          (E.A.)

MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII

quietus (kwy-EE-tuhs) noun

   1. A final stroke that settles something.

   2. Discharge from life; death.

   3. A release from a duty or debt.

[Short for Middle English quietus est (he is quit), a formula of discharge
from a debt or other obligation, from Medieval Latin quietus est, from Latin,
quietus, past participle of quiescere (to rest), from quies (rest, quiet).]

The words acquit, quiet, quiescent, acquiesce, are some of the cousins of
today's word, all descendants of the same common root.

  "It is not so much that writing provided an escape from the perils of the
   Revolution, but rather that the Revolution afforded a distraction from
   his inward soul-wrestling and austere studies and perpetual susceptibility
   to the lure of an easeful quietus."
   Andy Martin, Napoleon on Happiness, Raritan (New Brunswick, New Jersey),
   Spring 2000.

  "The irony is, of course, that the Curse will provide its own quietus and
   lead me to the peace I have so desperately sought."
   Michael Bywater, Not With a Whimper But With a Bang, Independent on Sunday
   (London, UK), May 19, 1996.

Scott:

Thanks for bringing Oppen back up out of the well. So appropriate. Also
appreciated your teaching notes.  I was in the Peace Corps teaching at the
University of Nigeria, Nsukka between 65 -67. I wish everybody could/can
have the profound experience of both hearing the indigenous - as awkward as
that word sounds to say - and introducing anglo-irish-american poetry into
another culture. Great for the ears, great for the soul. Most often
everything gets released from its bearings and comes up  - one culture's
signs wrapping around another -  with a whole new load of perceptions,
argument and freight. A critical assemblage that can fly in the face of
either indigenous orthodox critical interpretation. I think - this
assemblage - is the genuine and most pleasure-full part of what may be
called global modernity (or "post" if one wants to go there, as well).
   I stay in touch with my students, several of whom are now in America
teaching in English and African Studies departments, unable to tolerate
surviving in Nigeria. At the time I was teaching, Nigeria was on the
terrible brink of the Biafran civil war. Keeps the senses highly tuned, plus
an extraordinary adventure. Such as we're all in.

My bare bodkins, what a revelation!

Seriously though, I've just locked the ghosts Mr W. Shagspere and his son
Hamnet (notice the spelling) in the cellar as they couldn't stop laughing
but, although I like this little series of words of the day, don't you think
that alleged poets might be acquainted with what are known as dictionaries,

quietus (kwy-EE-tuhs) noun

   1. A final stroke that settles something.

   2. Discharge from life; death.

   3. A release from a duty or debt.

[Short for Middle English quietus est (he is quit), a formula of discharge
from a debt or other obligation, from Medieval Latin quietus est, from
Latin,
quietus, past participle of quiescere (to rest), from quies (rest, quiet).]

The words acquit, quiet, quiescent, acquiesce, are some of the cousins of
today's word, all descendants of the same common root.

... among the dictionaries Shakespeare might have read, we find:

"quietus"  [see below] ...

Looks as if Bill the Bard might have been the first to use the term
(metaphorically) as a discharge from the debts of life.  At least, so the
OED2(3) thinks.

*** It's not about oil or Iraq. It's about the US and Europe going
head-to-head on world economic dominance. ***

Summary: Why is George Bush so hell bent on war with Iraq? Why does his
administration reject every positive Iraqi move? It all makes sense when you
consider the economic implications for the USA of not going to war with
Iraq. The war in Iraq is actually the US and Europe going head to head on
economic leadership of the world.

America's Bush administration has been caught in outright lies, gross
exaggerations and incredible inaccuracies as it trotted out its litany of
paper thin excuses for making war on Iraq. Along with its two supporters,
Britain and Australia, it has shifted its ground and reversed its position
with a barefaced contempt for its audience. It has manipulated information,
deceived by commission and omission and frantically "bought" UN votes with
billion dollar bribes.

=46aced with the failure of gaining UN Security Council support for invading
Iraq, the USA has threatened to invade without authorisation. It would act
in breach of the UN's very constitution to allegedly enforced UN
resolutions.

It is plain bizarre. Where does this desperation for war come from?

There are many things driving President Bush and his administration to
invade Iraq, unseat Saddam Hussein and take over the country. But the
biggest one is hidden and very, very simple. It is about the currency used
to trade oil and consequently, who will dominate the world economically, in
the foreseeable future -- the USA or the European Union.

Iraq is a European Union beachhead in that confrontation. America had a
monopoly on the oil trade, with the US dollar being the fiat currency, but
Iraq broke ranks in 1999, started to trade oil in the EU's euros, and
profited. If America invades Iraq and takes over, it will hurl the EU and
its euro back into the sea and make America's position as the dominant
economic power in the world all but impregnable.

It is the biggest grab for world power in modern times.

America's allies in the invasion, Britain and Australia, are betting America
will win and that they will get some trickle-down benefits for jumping on to
the US bandwagon.

=46rance and Germany are the spearhead of the European force -- Russia would
like to go European but possibly can still be bought off.

Presumably, China would like to see the Europeans build a share of
international trade currency ownership at this point while it continues to
grow its international trading presence to the point where it, too, can
share the leadership rewards.

DEBATE BUILDING ON THE INTERNET

Oddly, little or nothing is appearing in the general media about this issue,
although key people are becoming aware of it -- note the recent slide in the
value of the US dollar. Are traders afraid of war? They are more likely to
be afraid there will not be war.

But despite the silence in the general media, a major world discussion is
developing around this issue, particularly on the internet. Among the many
articles: Henry Liu, in the 'Asia Times' last June, it has been a hot topic
on the Feasta forum, an Irish-based group exploring sustainable economics,
and W. Clark's "The Real Reasons for the Upcoming War with Iraq: A
Macroeconomic and Geostrategic Analysis of the Unspoken Truth" has been
published by the 'Sierra Times', 'Indymedia.org', and 'ratical.org'.

This debate is not about whether America would suffer from losing the US
dollar monopoly on oil trading -- that is a given -- rather it is about
exactly how hard the USA would be hit. The smart money seems to be saying
the impact would be in the range from severe to catastrophic. The USA could
collapse economically.

OIL DOLLARS

The key to it all is the fiat currency for trading oil.

Under an OPEC agreement, all oil has been traded in US dollars since 1971
(after the dropping of the gold standard) which makes the US dollar the de
facto major international trading currency. If other nations have to hoard
dollars to buy oil, then they want to use that hoard for other trading too.
This fact gives America a huge trading advantage and helps make it the
dominant economy in the world.

As an economic bloc, the European Union is the only challenger to the USA's
economic position, and it created the euro to challenge the dollar in
international markets. However, the EU is not yet united behind the euro --
there is a lot of jingoistic national politics involved, not least in
Britain -- and in any case, so long as nations throughout the world must
hoard dollars to buy oil, the euro can make only very limited inroads into
the dollar's dominance.

In 1999, Iraq, with the world's second largest oil reserves, switched to
trading its oil in euros. American analysts fell about laughing; Iraq had
just made a mistake that was going to beggar the nation. But two years on,
alarm bells were sounding; the euro was rising against the dollar, Iraq had
given itself a huge economic free kick by switching.

Iran started thinking about switching too; Venezuela, the 4th largest oil
producer, began looking at it and has been cutting out the dollar by
bartering oil with several nations including America's bete noir, Cuba.
Russia is seeking to ramp up oil production with Europe (trading in euros)
an obvious market.

The greenback's grip on oil trading and consequently on world trade in
general, was under serious threat. If America did not stamp on this
immediately, this economic brushfire could rapidly be fanned into a wildfire
capable of consuming the US's economy and its dominance of world trade.

HOW DOES THE US GET ITS DOLLAR ADVANTAGE?

Imagine this: you are deep in debt but every day you write cheques for
millions of dollars you don't have -- another luxury car, a holiday home at
the beach, the world trip of a lifetime.

Your cheques should be worthless but they keep buying stuff because those
cheques you write never reach the bank! You have an agreement with the
owners of one thing everyone wants, call it petrol/gas, that they will
accept only your cheques as payment. This means everyone must hoard your
cheques so they can buy petrol/gas. Since they have to keep a stock of your
cheques, they use them to buy other stuff too. You write a cheque to buy a
TV, the TV shop owner swaps your cheque for petrol/gas, that seller buys
some vegetables at the fruit shop, the fruiterer passes it on to buy bread,
the baker buys some flour with it, and on it goes, round and round -- but
never back to the bank.

You have a debt on your books, but so long as your cheque never reaches the
bank, you don't have to pay. In effect, you have received your TV free.

This is the position the USA has enjoyed for 30 years -- it has been getting
a free world trade ride for all that time. It has been receiving a huge
subsidy from everyone else in the world. As it debt has been growing, it has
printed more money (written more cheques) to keep trading. No wonder it is
an economic powerhouse!

Then one day, one petrol seller says he is going to accept another person's
cheques, a couple of others think that might be a good idea. If this
spreads, people are going to stop hoarding your cheques and they will come
flying home to the bank. Since you don't have enough in the bank to cover
all the cheques, very nasty stuff is going to hit the fan!

But you are big, tough and very aggressive. You don't scare the other guy
who can write cheques, he's pretty big too, but given a 'legitimate' excuse,
you can beat the tripes out of the lone gas seller and scare him and his
mates into submission.

And that, in a nutshell, is what the USA is doing right now with Iraq.

AMERICA'S PRECARIOUS ECONOMIC POSITION

America is so eager to attack Iraq now because of the speed with which the
euro fire could spread. If Iran, Venezuela and Russia join Iraq and sell
large quantities of oil for euros, the euro would have the leverage it needs
to become a powerful force in general international trade. Other nations
would have to start swapping some of their dollars for euros.

The dollars the USA has printed, the 'cheques' it has written, would start
to fly home, stripping away the illusion of value behind them. The USA's
real economic condition is about as bad as it could be; it is the most
debt-ridden nation on earth, owing about US$12,000 for every single one of
it's 280 million men, women and children. It is worse than the position of
Indonesia when it imploded economically a few years ago, or more recently,
that of Argentina.

Even if OPEC did not switch to euros wholesale (and that would make a very
nice non-oil profit for the OPEC countries, including minimising the various
contrived debts America has forced on some of them), the US's difficulties
would build. Even if only a small part of the oil trade went euro, that
would do two things immediately:

* Increase the attractiveness to EU members of joining the 'eurozone', which
in turn would make the euro stronger and make it more attractive to oil
nations as a trading currency and to other nations as a general trading
currency.

* Start the US dollars flying home demanding value when there isn't enough
in the bank to cover them.

* The markets would over-react as usual and in no time, the US dollar's
value would be spiralling down.

THE US SOLUTION

America's response to the euro threat was predictable. It has come out
fighting.

It aims to achieve four primary things by going to war with Iraq:

* Safeguard the American economy by returning Iraq to trading oil in US
dollars, so the greenback is once again the exclusive oil currency.

* Send a very clear message to any other oil producers just what will happen
to them if they do not stay in the dollar circle. Iran has already received
one message -- remember how puzzled you were that in the midst of moderation
and secularization, Iran was named as a member of the axis of evil?

* Place the second largest reserves of oil in the world under direct
American control.

* Provide a secular, subject state where the US can maintain a huge force
(perhaps with nominal elements from allies such as Britain and Australia) to
dominate the Middle East and its vital oil. This would enable the US to
avoid using what it sees as the unreliable Turkey, the politically
impossible Israel and surely the next state in its sights, Saudi Arabia, the
birthplace of al Qaeda and a hotbed of anti-American sentiment.

* Severe setback the European Union and its euro, the only trading bloc and
currency strong enough to attack the USA's dominance of world trade through
the dollar.

* Provide cover for the US to run a covert operation to overturn the
democratically elected government of Venezuela and replace it with an
America-friendly military supported junta -- and put Venezuala's oil into
American hands.

Locking the world back into dollar oil trading would consolidate America's
current position and make it all but impregnable as the dominant world
power -- economically and militarily. A splintered Europe (the US is working
hard to split Europe; Britain was easy, but other Europeans have offered
support in terms of UN votes) and its euro would suffer a serious setback
and might take decades to recover.

It is the boldest grab for absolute power the world has seen in modern
times. America is hardly likely to allow the possible slaughter of a few
hundred thousand Iraqis stand between it and world domination.

President Bush did promise to protect the American way of life. This is what
he meant.

JUSTIFYING WAR

Obviously, the US could not simply invade Iraq, so it began casting around
for a 'legitimate' reason to attack. That search has been one of increasing
desperation as each rationalization has crumbled. First Iraq was a threat
because of alleged links to al Qaeda; then it was proposed Iraq might supply
al Qaeda with weapons; then Iraq's military threat to its neighbours was
raised; then the need to deliver Iraqis from Saddam Hussein's horrendously
inhumane rule; finally there is the question of compliance with UN weapons
inspection.

The USA's justifications for invading Iraq are looking less impressive by
the day. The US's statements that it would invade Iraq unilaterally without
UN support and in defiance of the UN make a total nonsense of any American
claim that it is concerned about the world body's strength and standing.

The UN weapons inspectors have come up with minimal infringements of the UN
weapons limitations -- the final one being low tech rockets which exceed the
range allowed by about 20 percent. But there is no sign of the so-called
weapons of mass destruction (WMD) the US has so confidently asserted are to
be found. Colin Powell named a certain north Iraqi village as a threat. It
was not. He later admitted it was the wrong village.

'Newsweek' (24/2) has reported that while Bush officials have been
trumpeting the fact that key Iraqi defector, Lt. Gen. Hussein Kamel, told
the US in 1995 that Iraq had manufactured tonnes of nerve gas and anthrax
(Colin Powell's 5 February presentation to the UN was just one example) they
neglected to mention that Kamel had also told the US that these weapons had
been destroyed.

Parts of the US and particularly the British secret 'evidence' have been
shown to come from a student's masters thesis.

America's expressed concern about the Iraqi people's human rights and the
country's lack of democracy are simply not supported by the USA's history of
intervention in other states nor by its current actions. Think Guatemala,
the Congo, Chile and Nicaragua as examples of a much larger pool of US
actions to tear down legitimate, democratically elected governments and
replace them with war, disruption, starvation, poverty, corruption,
dictatorships, torture, rape and murder for its own economic ends. The most
recent, Afghanistan, is not looking good; in fact that reinstalled a
murderous group of warlords which America had earlier installed, then
deposed, in favour of the now hated Taliban.

Saddam Hussein was just as repressive, corrupt and murderous 15 years ago
when he used chemical weapons, supplied by the US, against the Kurds. The
current US Secretary for Defence, Donald Rumsfeld, so vehement against Iraq
now, was on hand personally to turn aside condemnation of Iraq and blame
Iran. At that time, of course, the US thought Saddam Hussein was their
man -- they were using him against the perceived threat of Iran's Islamic
fundamentalism.

Right now, as 'The Independent' writer, Robert Fisk, has noted, the US's
efforts to buy Algeria's UN vote includes promises of re-arming the military
which has a decade long history of repression, torture, rape and murder
Saddam Hussein himself would envy. It is estimated 200,000 people have died,
and countless others been left maimed by the activities of these monsters.
What price the US's humanitarian concerns for Iraqis? (Of course, the French
are also wooing Algeria, their former north African territory, for all they
are worth, but at least they are not pretending to be driven by humanitarian
concerns.)

Indonesia is another nation with a vote and influence as the largest Muslim
nation in the world. Its repressive, murderous military is regaining
strength on the back of the US's so-called anti-terror campaign and is
receiving promises of open and covert support -- including intelligence
sharing.

AND VENEZUELA

While the world's attention is focused on Iraq, America is both openly and
covertly supporting the "coup of the rich" in Venezuela, which grabbed power
briefly in April last year before being intimidated by massive public
displays of support by the poor for democratically-elected President Chavez
=46rias. The coup leaders continue to use their control of the private media=
,
much of industry and the ear of the American Government and its oily
intimates to cause disruption and disturbance.

Venezuela's state-owned oil resources would make rich pickings for American
oil companies and provide the US with an important oil source in its own
backyard.

Many writers have noted the contradiction between America's alleged desire
to establish democracy in Iraq while at the same time, actively undermining
the democratically-elected government in Venezuela. Above the line, America
rushed to recognise the coup last April; more recently, President Bush has
called for "early elections", ignoring the fact that President Chavez Frias
has won three elections and two referendums and, in any case, early
elections would be unconstitutional.

One element of the USA's covert action against Venezuela is the behaviour of
American transnational businesses, which have locked out employees in
support of "national strike" action. Imagine them doing that in the USA!
There is no question that a covert operation is in process to overturn the
legitimate Venezuelan government. Uruguayan congressman, Jose Nayardi, made
it public when he revealed that the Bush administration had asked for
Uruguay's support for Venezuelan white collar executives and trade union
activists "to break down levels of intransigence within the Chavez Frias
administration". The process, he noted, was a shocking reminder of the CIA's
1973 intervention in Chile which saw General Pinochet lead his military coup
to take over President Allende's democratically elected government in a
bloodbath.

President Chavez Frias is desperately clinging to government, but with the
might of the USA aligned with his opponents, how long can he last?

THE COST OF WAR

Some have claimed that an American invasion of Iraq would cost so many
billions of dollars that oil returns would never justify such an action.

But when the invasion is placed in the context of the protection of the
entire US economy for now and into the future, the balance of the argument
changes.

=46urther, there are three other vital factors:

=46irst, America will be asking others to help pay for the war because it is
protecting their interests. Japan and Saudi Arabia made serious
contributions to the cost of the 1991 Gulf war.

Second -- in reality, war will cost the USA very little -- or at least, very
little over and above normal expenditure. This war is already paid for! All
the munitions and equipment have been bought and paid for. The USA would
have to spend hardly a cent on new hardware to prosecute this war -- the
expenditure will come later when munitions and equipment have to be replaced
after the war. But munitions, hardware andso on are being replaced all the
time -- contracts are out. Some contracts will simply be brought forward and
some others will be ramped up a bit, but spread over a few years, the cost
will not be great. And what is the real extra cost of an army at war
compared with maintaining the standing army around the world, running
exercises and so on? It is there, but it is a relatively small sum.

Third -- lots of the extra costs involved in the war are dollars spent
outside America, not least in the purchase of fuel. Guess how America will
pay for these? By printing dollars it is going to war to protect. The same
happens when production begins to replace hardware. components, minerals,
etc. are bought in with dollars that go overseas and exploit America's
trading advantage.

The cost of war is not nearly as big as it is made out to be. The cost of
not going to war would be horrendous for the USA -- unless there were
another way of protecting the greenback's world trade dominance.

AMERICA'S TWO ACTIVE ALLIES

Why are Australia and Britain supporting America in its transparent Iraqi
war ploy?

Australia, of course, has significant US dollar reserves and trades widely
in dollars and extensively with America. A fall in the US dollar would
reduce Australia's debt, perhaps, but would do nothing for the Australian
dollar's value against other currencies. John Howard, the Prime Minister,
has long cherished the dream of a free trade agreement with the USA in the
hope that Australia can jump on the back of the free ride America gets in
trade through the dollar's position as the major trading medium. That would
look much less attractive if the euro took over a significant part of the
oil trade.

Britain has yet to adopt the euro. If the US takes over Iraq and blocks the
euro's incursion into oil trading, Tony Blair will have given his French and
German counterparts a bloody nose, and gained more room to manouevre on the
issue -- perhaps years more room. Britain would be in a position to demand a
better deal from its EU partners for entering the "eurozone" if the new
currency could not make the huge value gains guaranteed by a significant
role in world oil trading. It might even be in a position to withdraw from
Europe and link with America against continental Europe.

On the other hand, if the US cannot maintain the oil trade dollar monopoly,
the euro will rapidly go from strength to strength, and Britain could be
left begging to be allowed into the club.

THE OPPOSITION

Some of the reasons for opposition to the American plan are obvious --
America is already the strongest nation on earth and dominates world trade
through its dollar. If it had control of the Iraqi oil and a base for its
forces in the Middle East, it would not add to, but would multiply its
power.

The oil-producing nations, particularly the Arab ones, can see the writing
on the wall and are quaking in their boots.

=46rance and Germany are the EU leaders with the vision of a resurgent, unit=
ed
Europe taking its rightful place in the world and using its euro currency as
a world trading reserve currency and thus gaining some of the free ride the
United States enjoys now. They are the ones who initiated the euro oil trade
with Iraq.

Russia is in deep economic trouble and knows it will get worse the day
America starts exploiting its take-over of Afghanistan by running a pipeline
southwards via Afghanistan from the giant southern Caspian oil fields.
Currently, that oil is piped northwards -- where Russia has control.

Russia is in the process of ramping up oil production with the possibility
of trading some of it for euros and selling some to the US itself. Russia
already has enough problems with the fact that oil is traded in US dollars;
if the US has control of Iraqi oil, it could distort the market to Russia's
enormous disadvantage. In addition, Russia has interests in Iraqi oil; an
American take over could see them lost. Already on its knees, Russia could
be beggared before a mile of the Afghanistan pipeline is laid.

ANOTHER SOLUTION?

The scenario clarifies the seriousness of America's position and explains
its frantic drive for war. It also suggests that solutions other than war
are possible.

Could America agree to share the trading goodies by allowing Europe to have
a negotiated part of it? Not very likely, but it is just possible Europe can
stare down the USA and force such an outcome. Time will tell. What about
Europe taking the statesmanlike, humanitarian and long view, and
withdrawing, leaving the oil to the US, with appropriate safeguards for
ordinary Iraqis and democracy in Venezuela?

Europe might then be forced to adopt a smarter approach -- perhaps
accelerating the development of alternative energy technologies which would
reduce the EU's reliance on oil for energy and produce goods it could trade
for euros -- shifting the world trade balance.

Now that would be a very positive outcome for everyone.

Suddenly, the war becomes a reality

Suzanne Goldenberg in Baghdad
Wednesday March 19, 2003
The Guardian

Reality finally came to Baghdad yesterday. Overnight, sandbags sprouted on
football fields and roundabouts. In the evening the authorities rustled up
yet another peace demonstration.

The number of fatal car accidents seemed to surge, with drivers in a panic
to get home, or to get out. Chemists sold out of valium. Queues at petrol
stations broadened and lengthened in a country where fuel is ridiculously
cheap and plentiful. The price of mineral water doubled. Tinned foods and
packaged soups disappeared from supermarket shelves. Young couples rushed to
get engaged. Workers stored the files and fixtures from Iraqi government
office buildings.

Although Iraqis have talked of little else but war since last September -
when it would break out, how long it would last, would their soldiers fight
or flee, would Saddam Hussein let his grandchildren be slaughtered in a
final stand - it never seemed entirely real.

Until yesterday morning, that is, when news spread of President George
Bush's speech to the Americans.

After months of waiting and worry the prospect of imminent attack was here,
all too suddenly, and horribly real.

In the kitchen of the Abdel Hamid family you could see it had arrived. A
young boy, Amr, was making his own final preparations for the onslaught. He
was performing the last rites of a four-year-old. In his hand he brandished
a plastic gun. Whacking the ammunition clip into the toy, he held it to his
stomach and put on a fierce expression. Then he raised it to the heads of
the surrounding adults. "Where are my bullets?" he screamed.

Baghdadis have lived with the threat so long now that they have become used
to burying their fears. One technique is to recount their survival stories
of other US and British bombardments: in 1991, after Iraq's invasion of
Kuwait, in 1993, and again in 1998.

But by yesterday morning, as President Bush made plain, less than 48 hours
remained, and it was becoming impossible to hang on to those earlier
delusions.

Even the weapons inspectors were now all making their getaway.

On the runway of Saddam airport, an old soldier in an elegant dark suit and
red tie shepherded the weapons experts and remaining UN staff on to a
dilapidated green and white Iraqi Airways bus and towards the aircraft
waiting to take them to Cyprus.

At 10am a vehicle pulled up to the side of the building. "All loaded up,"
the driver said.

Geoffrey Beaumont, the deputy director of the inspectors, was outwardly
calm. "People are sad because they have put their hearts and souls and blood
and tears into this. They worked bloody hard, and let's face it, no one
wants war."

In neighbourhoods like Amr's all over Baghdad, they are dreading the next
few days. People are exhausted before it has even begun.

Amr's mother, Myasaa Abdel Hamid, is four months' pregnant and bone tired.
"I've started talking to him about the war during these last few days," she
said. "I told him, 'If you hear loud noises outside the house, don't worry,
they aren't coming in.'

"But he doesn't really get it. He wants to know why there is going to be a
war. He wants to know what Bush looks like. He wants to know if Bush is very
angry with us. He wants to know if Bush has planes and guns.

"I tell him, 'Bush has everything'."

As the weapons inspectors went through their departure formalities, Myasaa
used the morning for her own, grown-up's last rites.

She put a web of masking tape over the kitchen window in the hope of
stopping the glass being shattered by the vibrations of nearby bombs, and
piled mattresses and pillows in a ground-floor room, which is seen as a
safer sleeping quarters than the first floor.

A nephew arrived with cartons of fruit juice to add to the supplies stored
in an outdoor shed.

The neighbours revved up their generator for a test run, and Myasaa pumped
an exploratory trickle out of the tube well recently dug at her doorstep.

The only thing left for her to do now is cry when the bombs start dropping,
she said.

The only thing left for Mr Beaumont to do yesterday was to depart, on the
last UN plane out of Baghdad. As UN staff and weapons experts assembled at
the airport, with the occasional tennis racket sticking out of their
anonymous luggage, the inspectors were just beginning to take in the fact
that it was all over.

"I really thought this would go on and on," one inspector said.

"It was a unanimous decision of the security council to have inspections,
and I thought that meant something."

Others said they were convinced almost until the end that the world would
take note of the efforts of the chief inspectors, Hans Blix and Mohamed El
Baradei.

They left maintaining that they could have done the job of disarming Iraq,
if only America and Britain had given them more time.

"Blix gave me all the energy to feel, "Yeah, we have a job to do,'" one
inspector said.

His companion added: "We worked yesterday, and we would have worked today.
There was real commitment, let me tell you."

In the end though, none of it mattered.

Six Poems from a Work in Progress

Trench letters do get used
eventually for poetry you
long history of nihilism
Get ready to advance don't
everyone rattle camouflage
as if we are nothing only
company dive-bomb anxiety
A few persistent "islands"
of half inaudible whispers
jabbing the radioman Lethe


Photographs are very like
crossing the no-sail zone
Periscopes screens filters
no unused boots with me I
come home my dear mother he
wrote such harks each amok
embrasure an outlook bunker
I can fact the world-facts
go burrowing after statistics
Realism all that fantasia


The hark of his attention
has no battle-dreams now
nor severe astasia-abasia
nor possible peace negotiation
nor newsreel shots crossing
to our civilian situation
nerves are in perfect order
Sea-drift the cry ice-floe
he is out with his wiring-party
Meantime incendiary weapons


Among the level down
go crash men flitting
Where are you whine shells
Scatter I see sentries
Up to the neck in war
O patiently people being
blown to bits one hand
clutching bandages next
bit *Proverbs* and byword
Language of escalation
this pun assembles down


Nominated as President by
dream-consciousness a cup
and saucer dream in three
collated lectures signed
by Amundsen saying he did
reach the Pole an aftermath
of fatigue postwar period
from its own wreck spoil
Before in the Dardanelles
taking off Sam Browne belt
Might solve sleeplessness
thus in my own Presidency


To be brief Kant's theory of
long run wars to hysteria
shock and projectile cycle
viz mimetic character until
a day is filled with night
night with doubt with doubt
Tense armies immemorial soil
reverberation of artillery
I equate will and instinct
with the other plot Europe
Cold marches with soldiers
abreast you cold Predicate

these chords, my simulated heart, make my father die while crying for a day.
these chords, a little warzone, pities the wife and child, the people. these
days, the night has a fat moonlight building to the end of time. time ends
today. these chords are correct and lurching, breaking the afternoon into
shards for evening's sake. why talk, the world is a bomb. my bomb loves my
wife and child, and dad's a good gentle man. do you love the bland fog of
last night, and how the morning was deftly quiet, no explosions or tearing
noise? our changes are crude indications of some fiery element called a
final chord. that chord is voiced for seasons and the glinting ray. spring
starts early, in our very day, and we feel no loss whatsoever. we've got
this elegant charge and start. look how vocal one can be, words all around.
these chords, brusque and diffident, in the age that wears on us, says these
seasons and these trysts. I love my wife, my son, my father and my light. we
should all be together. good night in love extending thru the doors and
windows to the very night abroad. we are soaring chords alone.

For those of you who will be in New York and are concerned abt U.S.
policy toward the next moment along the "axis of evil," I forward
below the statement of purpose and announcement of the inaugural
meeting of the newly formed Committee of Concerned Korea Scholars.

For further information, the e-mail address of Charles Armstrong, a
North Korean specialist who teaches modern Korean history and
political science at Columbia, is <cra10@columbia.edu>. Unlike the
recent symposium here at UCLA on the North Korean "nuclear
challenge," this committee (see the roster below) is not mainly
filled with stooges from right-wing ditz tanks and (barely)
resuscitated Cold War Asia-hands.

Listening to King Gorge now...even the Pacifica reporters repeating
w/o contention phrases like "surgical strike," "precision targeted,"
"liberty shield," "35 countries".... But I trust they will--without
KPFK what cd I listen to.... Impeach the FCC....

In 1987, I was in Seoul when over a million people flooded into the
streets and brought down another imposter, Chun Du-hwan (the general
responsible for the massacre at Kwangju). It only took seven years.
It gives me hope, as does growing up during the anti-Vietnam War
movement. Even the disgustingly cynical CBS News podunks I was
working w got so inspired they leapt onto the demonstrators'
loudspeaker trucks to show their support. (I don't think they let Dan
Rather see that tape!) Yes, the situations are different, but...

Incredible energy among the completely rain-soaked 10,000
demonstrators (police sd a few hundred, no TV vans) in downtown L.A.
last Saturday. Hardest rain I've seen since the El Nino of '98 and
everyone kept shouting, holding the "Impeach Bush" banners aloft,
drumming away on their plastic pails. Speaker: "What a BEAUTIFUL day
in L.A.!" Another: "Let peace RAIN down on the world!"

But what writers and intellectuals need to help supply is a new
ideology too (and I don't mean this in the negative sense of
perpetual veil over the real relations of production). Deconstruction
didn't stop anything, although I probably once liked it as much as
anyone on this list did. Just another old tool, among many others, in
a pouch shot full of holes.

Subject:      "defending civilization" (the new fifth column)
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; CHARSET=US-ASCII

"Defending Civilization: How Our Universities Are Failing
America, and What Can Be Done About It" (American Council
of Trustees and Alumni, November 2001)

http://www.whitehouse.org/news/2002/images/lclist/traitor_academics.pdf


I for one was not aware of this horrific little document,
which came to me by way of the whitehouse.org satirical
site but is quite legit. (The American Council of Trustees
and Alumni was founded by Lynne Cheney and Joe Lieberman in
1995. See "Lynne Cheney-Joe Lieberman Group Puts Out a
Blacklist" by Roberto J. Gonzalez
[http://www.commondreams.org/views01/1213-05.htm].)

"Defending Civilization," while making noises about
upholding free speech, clearly implies that only traitors
make statements like these: "We have to learn to use
courage for peace instead of war" (Jerry Irish, Professor
of Religious Studies, Pomona College). "[O]ur security can
only come by using our national wealth, not for guns,
planes, and bombs, but for the health and welfare of our
people, and for people suffering in other countries"
(Howard Zinn). "If Osama Bin Laden is confirmed to be
behind the attacks, the United States should bring him
before an international tribunal on charges of crimes
against humanity" (Joel Beinin, Professor of Middle East
Studies at Stanford and President of the Middle East
Studies Association).

The ACTA ideological stance is one that may shed light on
why the FBI has been targeting university professors and
graduate students, as with the recent raid at the
University of Idaho and the persecution of Sami Amin
Al-Arian at the University of South Florida and Bashir Musa
Mohammed Nafim, who teaches at Birkbeck College, University
of London. Departments of Middle Eastern Studies and the
Middle Eastern Studies Association are under particularly
hostile scrutiny; see the website for Campus Watch:
Monitoring Middle East Studies on Campus
(www.campus-watch.org), and in particular Leslie Carbone's
"Terror's Academic Sympathizers" from 9 December 2002
(http://www.campus-watch.org/article/id/384).

One important context for this sort of activity is the
crusade to promote the notion of a "crisis in the
humanities" and to establish "academic change organizations
and networks whose fundamental mission is to 'take back'
the universities from scholars and academic programs
regarded either as too hostile to free markets or too
critical of the values and history of Western civilization"
("Targeting the Academy,"
http://www.mediatransparency.org/targeting_academy.htm) --
a crusade that Lynne Cheney has helped to lead. The
president of one such organization, the Intercollegiate
Studies Institute, claimed a decade ago that "the
conservative movement is now mature enough to sustain a
counteroffensive on that last Leftist redoubt, the college
campus" ("Targeting the Academy"). Now that the
conservatives are riding tall in the saddle, it seems that
this "counteroffensive" has been launched in earnest, and
launched against what they can now claim is a fifth column.

Friends:

www.ucalgary.ca/~cwh

Calgary Writers House has been updated.  The content is modest and
rewarding.  You will not be sad to stop by and listen or watch some of our
exciting media.

-Roy Miki (current recipient of the Governor General's award for a book of
poetry in English) and Fred Wah discuss contemporary poetics, William Carlos
Williams, and Roy Kiyooka

-Roy Miki and Louis Cabri launch  _Surrender_ (Mercury) and _The Mood
Embosser_ (Coach House) respectively.

-George Bowering (yes he is our poet laureate...) gives a great reading and
is interviewed...

-Robert Kroetsch offers many insights into current poetic form....

all this and much more.  update as regularly as a full time job, graduate
thesis, and social life will allow.

Thank you.

From Williams' Introduction to The Wedge

The war is the first and only thing in the world today.

The arts generally are not, nor is this writing a diversion from that =
for relief, a turning away. It is the war or part of it, merely a =
different sector of the field.

*    *    *

The arts have a complex relation to society. The poet isn't a fixed =
phenomenon, no more is his work. That might be a note on current =
affairs, a diagnosis, a plan for procedure, a retrospect--all in its own =
peculiarly enduring form. There need be nothing limited or frustrated =
about that. It my be a throw-off from the most violent or successful =
action or run parallel to it, a saga. It may be the picking out of an =
essential detail for memory, something to be set aside for further =
study, a sort of shorthand of emotional significance for later =
reference.

Let the metaphysical take care of itself, the arts have nothing to do =
with it.

Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"; format=flowed

March 19, 2003

Senate Remarks: The Arrogance of Power

I believe in this beautiful country. I have studied its roots and gloried
in the wisdom of its magnificent Constitution. I have marveled at the
wisdom of its founders and framers. Generation after generation of
Americans has understood the lofty ideals that underlie our great Republic.
I have been inspired by the story of their sacrifice and their strength.

But, today I weep for my country. I have watched the events of recent
months with a heavy, heavy heart. No more is the image of America one of
strong, yet benevolent peacekeeper. The image of America has changed.
Around the globe, our friends mistrust us, our word is disputed, our
intentions are questioned.

Instead of reasoning with those with whom we disagree, we demand obedience
or threaten recrimination. Instead of isolating Saddam Hussein, we seem to
have isolated ourselves. We proclaim a new doctrine of preemption which is
understood by few and feared by many. We say that the United States has the
right to turn its firepower on any corner of the globe which might be
suspect in the war on terrorism. We assert that right without the sanction
of any international body. As a result, the world has become a much more
dangerous place.

We flaunt our superpower status with arrogance. We treat UN Security
Council members like ingrates who offend our princely dignity by lifting
their heads from the carpet. Valuable alliances are split. After war has
ended, the United States will have to rebuild much more than the country of
Iraq. We will have to rebuild America's image around the globe.

The case this Administration tries to make to justify its fixation with war
is tainted by charges of falsified documents and circumstantial evidence.
We cannot convince the world of the necessity of this war for one simple
reason. This is a war of choice.

There is no credible information to connect Saddam Hussein to 9/11. The
twin towers fell because a world-wide terrorist group, Al Qaeda, with cells
in over 60 nations, struck at our wealth and our influence by turning our
own planes into missiles, one of which would likely have slammed into the
dome of this beautiful Capitol except for the brave sacrifice of the
passengers on board.

The brutality seen on September 11th and in other terrorist attacks we have
witnessed around the globe are the violent and desperate efforts by
extremists to stop the daily encroachment of western values upon their
cultures. That is what we fight. It is a force not confined to borders. It
is a shadowy entity with many faces, many names, and many addresses.

But, this Administration has directed all of the anger, fear, and grief
which emerged from the ashes of the twin towers and the twisted metal of
the Pentagon towards a tangible villain, one we can see and hate and
attack. And villain he is. But, he is the wrong villain. And this is the
wrong war. If we attack Saddam Hussein, we will probably drive him from
power. But, the zeal of our friends to assist our global war on terrorism
may have already taken flight.

The general unease surrounding this war is not just due to "orange alert."
There is a pervasive sense of rush and risk and too many questions
unanswered.  How long will we be in Iraq? What will be the cost? What is
the ultimate mission? How great is the danger at home? A pall has fallen
over the Senate Chamber. We avoid our solemn duty to debate the one topic
on the minds of all Americans, even while scores of thousands of our sons
and daughters faithfully do their duty in Iraq.

What is happening to this country? When did we become a nation which
ignores and berates our friends? When did we decide to risk undermining
international order by adopting a radical and doctrinaire approach to using
our awesome military might? How can we abandon diplomatic efforts when the
turmoil in the world cries out for diplomacy?

Why can this President not seem to see that America's true power lies not
in its will to intimidate, but in its ability to inspire?

War appears inevitable. But, I continue to hope that the cloud will lift.
Perhaps Saddam will yet turn tail and run. Perhaps reason will somehow
still prevail. I along with millions of Americans will pray for the safety
of our troops, for the innocent civilians in Iraq, and for the security of
our homeland. May God continue to bless the United States of America in the
troubled days ahead, and may we somehow recapture the vision which for the
present eludes us.

MEDIA ADVISORY:
Star Witness on Iraq Said Weapons Were Destroyed
Bombshell revelation from a defector cited by White House and press

February 27, 2003

On February 24, Newsweek broke what may be the biggest story of the Iraq
crisis. In a revelation that "raises questions about whether the WMD
[weapons of mass destruction] stockpiles attributed to Iraq still exist,"
the magazine's issue dated March 3 reported that the Iraqi weapons chief
who defected from the regime in 1995 told U.N. inspectors that Iraq had
destroyed its entire stockpile of chemical and biological weapons and
banned missiles, as Iraq claims.

Until now, Gen. Hussein Kamel, who was killed shortly after returning to
Iraq in 1996, was best known for his role in exposing Iraq's deceptions
about how far its pre-Gulf War biological weapons programs had advanced.
But Newsweek's John Barry-- who has covered Iraqi weapons inspections for
more than a decade-- obtained the transcript of Kamel's 1995 debriefing by
officials from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and the U.N.
inspections team known as UNSCOM.

I was watching one of the PBS channels here in NYC that were
carrying BBCWorld feed. The channel I was watching fed out
a shot of Bush sitting behind his desk in the Oval Office, his mouth
moving but issuing no words that I could hear, fidgeting, getting comfortable
in his chair, eyes darting here and there around the room. Then,
suddenly, a hand with a comb in it reached out, into the picture
frame, and began to touch up his hair. It was a woman's hand, on
a woman's arm. The comb in the woman's hand touched up the hair
on the left side of the President's head, and then the woman (but not
her head) could be seen moving behind the President, to give a few
strokes to the hair on the right side of his head (his more conservative
side, perhaps), and then BBCWorld, seemingly startled at what it
was showing the world, cut away to one of those stationary
cameras in Baghdad. And then, a few moments later, the President
reappeared, ready to speak to the world, and he spoke.

" If nothing else, you can examine your own brain patterns before,

i agree! really, it's the only way an artist can approach it---

the thing about war and anti-war activitsts is, it becomes (horribly) (thematically) more trend than content--putting up a NO WAR page is not going to accomplish anything at all (you can make the claim that it will provide information about the situation by linking to various news sources, but don't you think anyone really interested in this woulda sniffed that stuff out already?)--

i agree with t.whid////i'm against this war primarily because it will provoke more anger from an already angry (rightfully so) population------i'm also against it because of the very dangerous ideology george w. bush has been using---it's an ideology firmly entrenched in its own snug corner of the world---there's an axis of evil because there are political ideologies different from american capitalism---this is comic-book logic---

probably the most useful thing we can do is be kind to each other, and to especially be kind to muslims here in the US (they've had a tough time since 911!!!!)----understanding and kindness are ALWAYS more effective than bombs----THAT'S a helluva lot more effective than a NO WAR page----

we can also be watchful of civil liberties in this age of heightened security---i had a moroccan friend a while back who was a muslim----when i brought up the ACLU, he smiled and said, yes, this is why we come to your country----this is what we should keep in mind....america is only as great as the manifestation of that ideal---

In light of a stream of war related postings I would like to muse a moment
on the current situation as an artist.

War is obviously bad, but it is also interesting.

War is ongoing, nothing is really about to start.

Artists can obviously make a response to war, but there is little point in
them ranting about how bad they think it all is.

Even worse is to get all introspective, 'oh god, I am so impotent in the
face of all this horribleness'. Yes we are, but so what, we always were.

If you believe in art and in your art, you need to go on doing what you have
always done and not become an activist just because there is this
overwhelming media story about.

War will provide you with a huge reservoir of material for your work if you
want it. If nothing else, you can examine your own brain patterns before,
during and after the event.

Don't wear your heart on your sleeve.

Cheers,
Ivan 'Only exist' Pope

I'm not trying to be a jerk or anything, but I haven't signed up for
regular email notices from services like Wordsmith.com's
word.of.the.day, the Assassinated Press, Amazon news, etc.  Posting
links to new work and calls for new work is, obviously, beneficial to
the group. Posting every now then a link to a relevant article for
discussion makes sense to me as well.  But if Poetics members want to
subscribe to a notification list, they will.  To regularly repost
notifications makes a mockery of the idea of a notification list and
turns content into spam.

Maybe I'm the only one who feels this way, but I wanted to open up a

I find this article fascinating. World Opinion and the Peace Movement here
have forced the American Military - it would seem - to deconstruct. No
display of the flag so that "we" will not be confused as an army of
conquest. In a corporate global culture in which brand identity is
everything behind establishing control over a sales (etc.) environment, thi=
s
is either an amazing act of humility or deception. Guess which. Nevertheles=
s
it shows - I believe - the critical mass of anti-war opposition is forcing
Bush & Co. into, at least, altering the color of strategy.
And then there is the "no" on the candy-give-away  business. In a country i=
n
which we know that children are desperate for food, the troops are being
told not to throw candy because swarms of children may get rolled over and
impede the mission and movement of million dollar tanks. Etc. Etc.

I also find the article interesting in that the troops are actually debatin=
g
over the loss of showing the flag as well as the objectives of the war. One
can only imagine morale issues settling in once the Occupation becomes
transparently ambiguous.

MILITARY ORDERS

Troops Told to Carry Freedom, Not the Flag
By JIM DWYER

AMP NEW JERSEY, Kuwait, March 19, 2003 =8B As United States troops rolled
toward the Iraq border this week, they were given orders on two matters of
decorum: no throwing of candy to Iraqi children and no displaying of flags =
=8B
regimental, state or even the American flag.

Military officials say that candy giveaways would draw swarms of children t=
o
the convoys, a dangerous proposition with thousands of trucks, Humvees and
trailers barreling toward Baghdad.

As for the ban on flags, its effect was apparent in this camp today, where
no more than a handful of vehicles mustering for the invasion displayed any=
.

Officials say the flag could give the citizens of Iraq the wrong idea about
the convoys of artillery, ammunition and soldiers. They are not, these
officials say, an army of conquest, intent on claiming Iraqi land or
treasure for the United States, but a liberation force. They are concerned
that streams of American flags would be seen as provocative.

"It's imposing enough that we're coming into another society," said Capt.
Frank Stanco, a commander with an artillery unit in the 101st Airborne
Division. "I tell our soldiers we want to maintain our professionalism. We
could be making history. I call it being quiet professionals."

In 1991, at the end of the Persian Gulf war, American military convoys
entered Kuwait festooned with the stars and stripes after a quick rout of
the Iraqi Army occupying the country. Soldiers recall being greeted
rapturously by the Kuwaitis.

This afternoon, thousands of soldiers sat in long convoys, fully packed and
waiting for orders to begin an invasion that would carry many of them 400
miles north to Baghdad. Only a handful of the vehicles flew American flags.

The no-flags order was passed along to the 101st Airborne by its commander,
Maj. Gen. David H. Petraeus, who said the decision had been made by his
superiors. "It's the right thing to do," said General Petraeus, a way of
underscoring the American commitment to ousting the Iraqi government to
enhance security and human rights, and not to seizing the country.

Spokesmen for the United States Central Command in Qatar said they were
unable to provide information about the order today.

The question of flag flying provoked a small debate among artillery soldier=
s
waiting to leave camp today. Specialist John Garcia said he was angry that
he had been ordered to take down his flag, and that so few countries were
supporting the United States and Britain in the military campaign.

"When they're in trouble, they don't call Russia, China, France, Turkey,"
said Specialist Garcia. "They call 911, the United States." That's why I pu=
t
my flag on my Humvee."

Another soldier, Specialist Robert Bratton, said: "You can't blame them. Yo=
u
got a lot of Americans back in the States against it."

A sergeant, Elmer Smith, said the United States was seen as interfering in
the affairs of too many countries.

Specialist Bratton said, "What's the reason we're fighting?"

Specialist Garcia answered, "I think Saddam Hussein got them weapons."

Specialist Bratton shook his head.

"I think it's oil," he said.

Sergeant Smith offered his theory. "I think it's revenge for his father," h=
e
said.

To Captain Stanco, who did not take part in the debate over the war's
purpose, the flag issue reflected the complexity of the American task in
Iraq. "We want to send the right statements," he said.

Just learned that my students are staging a walkout at 11:30 to protest the war
(in coordination w/ rest of RISD students), so wrote them this song:

And it's one two three,
What are we fightin for?
Don't ask me I don't give a fuck,
Next stop Baghdad, Iraq!

One, two, three,
What are we fightin for?
Y'all, I got no idea,
Next stop is North Korea!

I said, one, two, three,
What are we fightin for?
Don't ask me I don't give a damn,
Next stop Tehran, Iran!

That's not my point.  My point is that if they find the word.a.day
service useful, they can go to http://wordsmith.org/awad/subscribe.html
and subscribe.  And if they want to occasionally post to Poetics and
comment on a word that tickles their fancy, then why not? But forwarding
every post with no commentary defeats the purpose of Wordsmith's own
notification list and hinders this list with content that can be gotten
by interested parties elsewhere.  Which is, IMHO, not a "chivalrous or
adventurous enterprise".

Ah, the two post limit.  See ya'll in 24.

STATEMENT: LIGHT HAS NO TONGUE

Light has no tongue is a hyperpoem with recombinative music. The music for the work composes itself based on Western functional tonality. Users can read the work three ways--by listening to the randomly accessed voice, by clicking within the draggable film mask, or by reading the tickertape text scrolling by at the bottom of the piece. Via these three methods, a kind of haiku is created.

Sticker Attack On Cups in US Senate Cafeteria

(Gothic News Service, 03/21) The United States Senate Press Office reported
a strange event in the Senate Cafeteria this morning. When Senators sat dow=
n
to take breakfast, each one found themselves surprised to look at a puzzlin=
g
image uniquely glued to the outside of each of their coffee cups. Inserted
between a gold Roman Capital letter  "I" and the letter "M" was a picture o=
f
a big orange peach nesting on the black branches of a dead bush.
Senate cafeteria workers - many of who are reported to be against the Iraq
war - reported that Senators raised their cups and looked both confused and
attracted by the colorful image. Out of curiosity =AD maybe because he=B9s
classical educated =AD several Members walked over to Senator Byrd=B9s table
where, these days, he=B9s normally camped out alone or with Senator Kennedy.
"It=B9s an old fashioned =8Crebus=B9," Byrd said, holding up his cup.
"Rebus?"=20
"Yes," said the Senator, rose from his table, cup in hand, to give a little
lecture to his colleagues. "A rebus is a hieroglyphic riddle, "non verbis
sed rebus." The origin of the word and custom is this: The basochiens of
Paris, during the carnival, used to satirize the current follies and events
of the day in squibs called De rebus qu=E6 geruntur. That these squibs might
not be accounted libelous, they employed hieroglyphics either wholly or in
part."
"What hieroglyphics do you see here," Senator McCain asked.
"It=B9s simple, Senator. The "IM" goes first, followed by "Peach" followed by
"Bush". Put it all together and it=B9s "IMPEACH BUSH". I guess someone or som=
e
ones are trying to get a message through to this Body"
"Out with the cups," yelled several Republican Senators. Senator McCain
reportedly left his cup on Byrd=B9s table. "Support the troops," he said and
turned away.
"I think I will stay here and enjoy my coffee," said Senator Byrd.
Later this morning Operation Rebus Insert (OPI) - an anonymous unit of
Washington Cafeteria Workers Local 101 - left messages with several
Washington media groups to take responsibility for the event. They are
quoted as saying. "Operation Rebis Insert" is not based on military "Insert=
"
models currently in operation in Iraq. OPI is non-violent. We will strike
and insert wherever necessary to impeach this President and wage Peace.

Noelle Kocot's poems have appeared in The Iowa Review, The American Poetry
Review, New American Writing, Fence, Conduit, Lungfull! and many other

published in 2001. Her next collection, The Raving Fortune, will be
published by Four Way Books in 2004. In 2001, she received a fellowship from
the National Endowment for the Arts and had a poem included in Best American
Poetry.

Andrew Maxwell lives in Los Angeles, where he works as a lexicographer and

chapbook, Radiant Species (Tougher Disguises), and a full-length collection
of poetry, The Coward Ecumenical (Subpress) are due out later this year.

WEDNESDAY MARCH 26 [8:00pm]
MERRY FORTUNE AND PETER BUSHYEAGER
Merry Fortune is the author of Moral. Her poems, stories, and reviews have
appeared in issues of Cover, Sensitive Skin, Skunk, Tamarind, Trembling
Ladders, Unbearables/portfolio #9, and The World. She was a co-editor of
Living With a White Girl (a collection of poetry, reviews, art and
interviews with a mostly female agenda) and Pagan Place (a humorous,
introspective, alternative collection of esoterica). She is a former Program
Coordinator of the Poetry Project Monday Night Performance/Reading Series

Pagan Place, and the Help Yourself! anthology (Autonomedia). His reviews and
commentary have been published in Rain Taxi, The Poetry Project Newsletter
and in the Talisman House critical anthology The World in Time and Space.
Lewis Warsh has called his work "sexy, dark, combustible, with danger
lurking at the edges," and notes that "his terrain is the ineffable
mindspace between office and street, hotel restaurant and highway, chaos and
control. These poems are [...] asking the age-old question: 'Which way is
home?'"

Unless otherwise noted, admission to all events is $10, $7 for students and

personal news from the protest in san francisco

down town . . . to =93shut it down=94 . . .  or something . . . the bus =
I=20
was on came to a stand still about four blocks from van ness. for those=20=

who do not know, that is still a ways from the financial district which=20=

I thought was my agenda...so I exited and walked a few blocks and saw a=20=

group in the middle of a block stopping traffic. there was a lot of=20
pink and some with  clown makeup on... and when I talked to a few, I=20
realized it was the =93gay shame=94 group... drag kings, queens, ftm=92s,=20=

mtf=92s, dykes, faggy boyz and  faggy girlz out to stop the war and shut=20=

down san francisco . . . . ok, so I have found my group . . . . for=20
hours we marched from on block to the next, pausing long enough to stop=20=

traffic. occasionally we ran into other groups doing the same thing.=20
The groups seem to range in size from over 100 to 300+.  as far as I=20
could tell these roaming  groups did shut san Francisco down - no=20
matter what the media states...it was powerful, no traffic at time or=20
traffic backed up for blocks...


the whole thing seemed fairly well organized. there where scouts on=20
bikes who searched out police. someone had brought fruit and fluids.=20
trash cans, news paper containers and what ever was pulled into the=20
street to stop traffic. when we approached the main highway the police=20=

seemed to be prepared to stop us from blocking the entry way. the idea=20=

of being a moving target seemed to be a good strategy. at one point the=20=

motor cycle police seemed to be leading our group, so we changed=20
directions, the police had to reorganize-.. after marching for 4 =20
hours, I needed a bathroom brake and lost my =93gay shame=94 group, but=20=

there where plenty of groups...one I saw was just  bikes. I heard there=20=

was a group in wheel chairs.


some of the worst things I saw was when we would try to stop  traffic,=20=

some in cars actually tried to run protester over... it was some of the=20=

worst of humanity I had seen. I was surprised the police actually=20
stopped a couple cars for that reason. one of the most heroic acts I=20
saw was when an individual in a wheel chair, not a part of our group=20
rode the chair out and stopped traffic.


I ended up at the civic center to hear speeches. I was inspired when I=20=

heard a 12 year old (6 grade) speak who had skipped classes.  this was=20=

a huge resistance to this horrible act and the momentum must keep=20
going. after a little over six hours I came home  and realized all that=20=

was not enough. the bombing and killing continues.. a great revolution=20=

needs to take place.=

Just to chime in here -- not a lot of walking around on my end. With a=20=

few other poet friends, I took part in an action to block the entrances=20=

to the SF Federal Building. Again, as per kari's experience, well=20
coordinated, friendly (with the exception of one near-incoherent=20
screamer, people trying to engage SF and federal cops in dialogue, for=20=

example), and in good spirits considering the awful imperialist war=20
crime currently in progress.

Got home to find a message from another friend who is currently in a=20
holding cell. Many on this list know her, but I'll have to withhold her=20=

name until I hear from her "live" and clear it. Suffice it to say that=20=

she sounded physically well, though choking on rage at our=20
unconscionable state and its corporate beneficiaries. (Bechtel, one of=20=

the companies awarded the no-bid private sector reconstruction=20
contracts for post-occupation Iraq (read: opportunities to sink a lot=20
of overaccumulated finance capital into fixed capital built on spec) is=20=

headquartered here in SF -- has anyone heard of any actions there?)

Have to run and check on the safety of other friends, and check in with=20=

my family for news of my brother, but I want to commend all my comrades=20=

who turned out today to counterpose the power of democratic imagination=20=

against the crapulent reality of our current 18th Brumaire.

Yrs in struggle,
Taylor

Youth Wants to Know Department:

A group of 500 plus high school students from working class neighborhoods in
and around the Fruitvale District of Oakland, which is largely Latino,
Southeast Asian, African-American, attempted to board the Bay Area Rapid
Transit (BART) this afternoon, asking BART to let them take the train for
free.  They were denied this request, and then BART closed the Fruitvale BART
station.  The students, who had walked out of school to protest the war,
attempted to take the bus to downtown Oakland, where a rally at Frank Ogawa
Square had been taking place most of the day.  The municipal buses refused to
stop for these students.  Thus the students walked the many miles to downtown
Oakland, not able to get across the Bay Bridge to participate in actions in
San Francisco, having been denied access to public transportation.
       Oakland is notorious for its poor public schools, which are now being
further eviscerated due to budget cuts in the state of California.

I hit Market St. at noon just as a phalanx of riot police were marching east
towards the stand-off at 6th St. I had my mini-recorder with me, and asked
one of the cops what was going on -- "Haven't you been listening to the
radio today?" was all I could get him to say.

At first there was a weird sense of chaos, as if neither the police nor the
protesters really knew what was going on or where things were heading. At
6th and Market, another group of people would spill down from a side street,
to be met by another phalanx of riot cops deploying on one or another
intersection. I saw a dozen or so people get arrested for blocking Market,
although it was already closed.

Then the police herded us up a side street, flanked us, and broke the block
in two, surrounding us and not letting anyone move from a half-block area.
While a woman sobbed at the feet of some officers, a glass bottle came
flying and shattered in the street. To their credit, the police didn't
flinch. People eventually spilled back down to Market and joined the march
that had been headed east from Civic Center. When we reached 6th St., the
police stopped us again and we were boxed in on about a block of Market for
20 minutes or so. Construction workers on the scaffolding of a nearby
building shouted down to us and flashed peace signs.

The march moved back west up Market. Some stragglers confronted police at
the rear, but eventually moved. We marched to Van Ness then up to
California, then down to Davis and right onto Market, four, five miles
total. I interviewed people as I went -- people marching, people stopped in
cars waiting for the march to pass, old people, young people, women, men.
Most folks (in cars) were fairly sanguine about having to wait. Muni drivers
in stalled cable cars rang their bells and allowed marchers to climb aboard
and ring them, too. I interviewed a couple of men who were shouting angrily
at protesters from kiosks on Market St. One of them claimed to be a former
marine and said that while the war was "dirty," we must support our troops.
I interviewed a man whose wife had just been arrested (along with a dozen or
so "anarchist"-type kids) and was waiting to be put in the paddy wagon. Will
transcribe all and post somewhere.

Two things struck me about this protest: the broad spectrum of people I saw
on the streets, overwhelmingly young but also with older folks, from middle
to granny-age, and the restraint shown by the police. I heard reports of
someone grabbing for a gun and hundreds of people arrested, but saw no
violence myself. Even the man whose wife was booked had a very chill
attitude about it, and seemed to think she would be released in a couple of
hours.

Tonight I have to pick up my girlfriend at Oakland Airport, so am hoping I'm
able to make it over the bridge... peace out.

>WASHINGTON -- William J. Casey was a quick study, always
>looking for an edge whether in business or in the ideological
>struggles that consumed the last years of his life. So in early
>August 1983, the balding CIA director hunched over a desk at the
>old Executive Office Building and scribbled down notes from five
>public relations experts who were brainstorming how to sell
>Ronald Reagan's Central American policies to the American people.
>
>Earlier that day, a national security aide had warmed the P.R.
>men to their task with dire predictions that leftist governments
>would send waves of refugees into the United States and cynically
>flood America with drugs. The P.R. executives jotted down some
>thoughts over lunch and then pitched their ideas to the CIA
>director in the afternoon.
>
>"Casey was kind of spearheading a recommendation" for better
>public relations for Reagan's Central America policies, recalled
>William I. Greener Jr., one of the ad men. Two top proposals
>arising from the meeting were for a high-powered communications
>operation inside the White House and private money for an
>outreach program to build support for U.S. intervention.
>
>The ideas from that session and other meetings held during the
>Reagan administration's first years still resonate today. Through
>the mid-1980s, Casey's domestic propaganda campaign would descend
>into scandal-generation and disinformation against opponents,
>tactics that are now generic to American politics.
>
>But few Americans know about Casey's "public diplomacy"
>apparatus which refined this approach in the 1980s -- or that the
>operation was overseen by CIA propagandists and military
>psychological warfare experts steeped in an Orwellian concept
>called "perception management."
>
>Scores of documents about this operation poured out during the
>Iran-contra scandal. The documents made clear that the driving
>force behind these aggressive P.R. tactics was Casey, the World
>War II spymaster who understood the power of information and the
>value of deception. But the documents received little attention
>in the mainstream press.
>
>As the Washington media grew bored with the Iran-contra story,
>articles focused on the celebrity of Lt. Col. Oliver North and
>narrow questions, such as who authorized a diversion of Iran arms
>sales profits to the Nicaraguan contra rebels. Yet, the "public
>diplomacy" campaign was a dramatic tale, too. It was the story of
>how the top level of the CIA had circumvented law and manipulated
>U.S. public opinion in support of CIA covert operations in
>Central America. Although the CIA is legally barred from
>influencing domestic politics, no one was held accountable for
>the apparent violations of law.
>
>At the start of the Reagan administration, Casey's challenge
>had seemed daunting. The administration saw Sandinista-ruled
>Nicaragua as another Cuba and Daniel Ortega as another Castro.
>But in late 1980, the American people saw El Salvador's right-
>wing military engaged in a bloodbath against leftist political
>opponents. To make matters worse, Salvadoran soldiers even raped
>and murdered four American churchwomen. The public also retained
>fears of "another Vietnam."
>
>So, Reagan's initial strategy of bolstering the Salvadoran
>army required defusing the negative publicity and somehow
>rallying the American people to the anti-communist cause. As
>deputy assistant secretary to the Air Force, J. Michael Kelly,
>put it, "the most critical special operations mission we have ...
>is to persuade the American people that the communists are out to
>get us."
>
>
>HOUNDING THE PRESS
>
>At the same time, the White House worked to weed out American
>reporters who uncovered facts that undercut the desired images.
>As part of that effort, the administration attacked New York
>Times correspondent Raymond Bonner for disclosing the massacre of
>about 800 men, women and children in the village of El Mozote in
>northeast El Salvador in December 1981. Accuracy in Media and
>conservative news organizations, such as The Wall Street
>Journal's editorial page, joined in pummeling Bonner, who was
>soon ousted from his job.
>
>The administration also made sure to reward its friends.
>According to one National Security Council memo dated May 20,
>1983, U.S. Information Agency director Charles Wick brought
>private donors to the White House situation room for a fund-
>raiser which collected $400,000 for AIM and a few other pro-
>Reagan groups.
>
>By then, "public diplomacy" was becoming Casey's new code word
>for influencing the opinions of the American people as well
>citizens of foreign countries. "The overall purpose" behind
>Casey's initiative "would be to sell a 'new product' -- Central
>America -- by generating interest across-the-spectrum," another
>NSC document stated.
>
>A "public diplomacy strategy paper," dated May 5, 1983, summed
>up the problem. "As far as our Central American policy is
>concerned, the press perceives that: the USG [U.S. government] is
>placing too much emphasis on a military solution, as well as
>being allied with inept, right-wing governments and groups. ...
>The focus on Nicaragua [is] on the alleged U.S.-backed 'covert'
>war against the Sandinistas. Moreover, the opposition ... is
>widely perceived as being led by former Somozistas."
>
>The administration's difficulty with most of these press
>perceptions was that they were correct. But the strategy paper
>recommended ways to influence various groups of Americans to
>"correct" the impressions anyway, what another planning document
>would call "perceptional obstacles." "Themes will obviously have
>to be tailored to the target audience," the strategy paper said.
>
>So, with Casey personally consulting experts, a "public
>diplomacy" apparatus took shape to carry out this "perception
>management." The operation was based in the NSC and was directed
>by Walter Raymond Jr., the CIA's top propaganda expert until
>transferring to the NSC in 1982.
>
>
>A LE CARRE SPY
>
>Raymond, a 30-year veteran of CIA clandestine services, was a
>slight, soft-spoken New Yorker who reminded some of a character
>from a John le Carre spy novel, an intelligence officer who
>"easily fades into the woodwork," according to one acquaintance.
>Raymond formally resigned from the CIA in April 1983 so, he said,
>"there would be no question whatsoever of any contamination of
>this."
>
>But from the beginning, Raymond fretted about the legality of
>Casey's involvement. Raymond confided in one memo that it was
>important "to get [Casey] out of the loop," but Casey never
>backed off and Raymond continued to send progress reports to his
>old boss well into 1986.
>
>It was "the kind of thing which [Casey] had a broad catholic
>interest in," Raymond shrugged during his Iran-contra deposition.
>He then offered the excuse that Casey undertook this apparently
>illegal interference in domestic politics "not so much in his CIA
>hat, but in his adviser to the president hat."
>
>Raymond also understood that the administration's hand in the
>P.R. projects must stay hidden, because of other legal bans on
>executive-branch propaganda. "The work down within the
>administration has to, by definition, be at arms length," Raymond
>noted in an Aug. 29, 1983, memo.
>
>Repeatedly, Raymond lectured his subordinates on the chief
>goal of the operation: "in the specific case of Nica[ragua],
>concentrate on gluing black hats on the Sandinistas and white
>hats on UNO [the contras' United Nicaraguan Opposition]." There
>was no space for the fact that both sides wore gray hats. So
>Reagan's speechwriters dutifully penned descriptions of
>Sandinista-ruled Nicaragua as a "totalitarian dungeon" and the
>contras as the "moral equivalent of the Founding Fathers."
>
>As one NSC official told me, the campaign was modeled after
>CIA covert operations abroad where a political goal is more
>important than the truth. "They were trying to manipulate [U.S.]
>public opinion ... using the tools of Walt Raymond's trade craft
>which he learned from his career in the CIA covert operation
>shop," the official admitted.
>

Hi all,

Have been bolstered today by the reports from SF.  I've heard a few people
lamenting this moment as a low point in American history.  A low point it
surely is but its one among many I'm afraid, and that's from someone who tends
to be fairly high and optimistic on U.S. culture, if not U.S. government.  The
truth seems to be that we very rarely live up to the high ideals expressed in
the original draft of the Declaration of Independence (the one which included
emancipation of slaves before Georgia and South Carolina insisted on its
removal) and the Bill of Rights.  Every once in a while we get a decade where
we, the inmates, somehow gain control of the asylum.  Abolitionists like
Douglass and Emerson were surely even more exasperated than we are in their
day.  Emerson said this about the state of American democracy on the eve of the
Civil War:

"Language has lost its meaning in the universal cant,  Representative
Government is really misrepresentative; Union is a conspiracy  against the
Northern States  which the Northern States are to have the privilege of paying
for; the adding of Cuba and Central America to the slave marts is enlarging the
area of Freedom.  Manifest Destiny, Democracy, Freedom, fine names for an ugly
thing.  They call it otto of rose and lavender, - I call it bilge-water."

He would surely say now that we can't let a phrase like "Operation Iraqi
Freedom" go by without subjecting it to ridicule until it sounds precisely as
it means, "Operation Iraqi Bleed 'em".  Walk the walk, talk the talk.

-m.

Just heard an AMAZING interview with a journalism prof named Robert Jensen
at U ot T in Austin on NPR call-in. Scott Simon tried to shut him up, get a
word in, but Jensen just kept talking, smoothly, facts-at-hand, denouncing
smartly and briskly and calmly this incredibly idiotic act of illegal
aggression by the Bush adminstration and the few times when Simon could get
a word in to ask a question designed to rebut him, Jensen knocked it out of
the park.  I wrote Jensen to thank and congratulate him and he fired back a
nice email and at the end of it was this url, check it:

In light of an illegal attack upon a devastated country that has already
lost 750, 000 children due to an ongoing embargo and a previous merciless
attack upon this country in 1991 I would like to muse on my situation as an
artist who has other roles and responsibilities and concerns as well.

War is not only obviously bad, but it is also banal.

This is not  a war, and it is possible to end the pointless slaughter.

Artists can avoid responding to war, but there is little point in remaining
helpless, passive, and silent about these atrocities.

Even better, It is possible to avoid introspection, but since there is
little point in trying to deny one's thoughts, it is best to try to reflect
on them as if to say "oh god, that's who we've really become by sticking our
heads in the sand."

If you believe in art and in your personal art, you might try to inspire
others and reinterpret the facts and the actual situation to everyone who
has been misinformed and hypnotized by the omnipresent corporate owned,
manipulated media.

War will horrify you and will deluge your reservoir of artistic source
material with images of misery, futility, hopelessness and pain before,
during and after the event.

Get in touch with your feelings and share them with anyone who will listen;
as as result you will feel energized instead of depressed, bitter and
cynical.

With immense sadness, and hope,

Nick- "We must love one another or die"-Piombino

Try this from Emerson's

"Quashee (the emblematic black)

in the northern darkness the fish has its name kun, of it no idea how many
thousand li, and it's a bird and it's name is peng, yes it is, it's got an
enormous back, i've got no idea how many li it is, when it gets angry or
aroused then it takes off and its wings! its wings! you can't imagine how
big they are, anyway an anhinga and an atala butterfly were talking and
saying to each other, wow, you just can't fly high enough to see the whole
pond which was in a cut that shook the water but seemed much larger. so
they said, the story is in the northern darkness, etc. that's how big the
world is, so big that you can't imagine or even walk through it. and what
comes out of the northern darkness goes into the southern darkness, yes it
does, i can't imagine how it does that, but it does. i don't think it sees
much of anything either, but then how should i know, its colors are
amazing, maybe it's because it's so large there's room for everything, i
think maybe it's a bird called peng, but some say it's a fish called kun,
but how could fish fly, and how could a bird swim across the darkness so
far it goes from north to south, you can head north and arrive south, you
can head south and arrive north, a white horse is black, a dog isn't a
dog, you never know, loafing long ago and floating just about in any
direction, in the south, something stirs for three thousand li, some say
it's the waters, some just can't imagine

The best writing I've ever read on exactly these
questions is Mahmoud Darwish's book "Memory for

Iraq Acknowledges Strike on Saddam's Home
16 minutes ago  Add Top Stories - AP to My Yahoo!


By HAMZA HENDAWI, Associated Press Writer

BAGHDAD, Iraq - Iraq (news - web sites)'s information
minister acknowledged Friday that one of Saddam
Hussein (news - web sites)'s homes was hit in the U.S.
bombardment, but said no one was hurt.

"They rocketed the residence of his household,"
Mohammed Sa'eed al-Sahhaf said at a news conference.
"But thank God, they are all safe."


Al-Sahhaf lashed out at the "criminal George Bush and
his gang."


"They are superpower of villains. They are superpower
of Al Capone," he said. "We will not allow them to get
out of this quagmire which we trapped them in. They
will see their end there."


Saddam offered a reward of $14,000 to any Iraqi who
kills an enemy soldier, and $28,000 to anyone who
captures an enemy soldier alive, according to a decree
reported by the official Iraqi News Agency.


A semblance of normalcy returned to Baghdad after
Thursday night's bombing.


There was a great deal of traffic on the streets, many
shops were open and many people were out on the
street.


But there was still a heavy security presence,
including armed members of the ruling Baath Party,
security forces and police, and pickup trucks mounted
with heavy machine guns.


The official Iraqi News Agency said 37 people were
injured in Thursday night's raid at heart of Baghdad
and in other locations in and around the city.


Standing next to Al-Sahhaf at the news conference was
Interior Minister Mahmoud Diab al-Ahmed, carrying a
Kalashnikov rifle and ammunition and wearing a
military uniform and flak jacket with a knife in the
pocket and a pistol on his hip.


"Some of you might may be wondering why do I have a
Kalashnikov in my hand and wearing a flak jacket," he
said. "Because we have all in Iraq pledged never to
relinquish our weapons until the day of victory."


Sahhaf also denied any U.S.-led advance into Iraq and
argued that TV images of Iraqis surrendering were
fabricated.


"Those are not Iraqi soldiers at all," he said. "Where
did they bring them from?"


Al-Sahhaf suggested that any captured U.S. and British
soldiers may not be treated as prisoners of war under
the Geneva Conventions. Al-Sahhaf said Iraq was
considering how to treat them.


"Those are mercenaries. Most probably they will be
treated as mercenaries, hirelings and as war
criminals. ... For sure, international law does not
apply to those," he said.


A busload of journalists was taken to the main
Al-Douri power plant, which was damaged in the 1991
Gulf War (news - web sites), where at least 12 human
shields from Switzerland, Turkey, France and the
United States are staying.


The lone American, Mark Ubans of Wallington, Mo.,
said: "There seems to be no way to stop this war. So
the least people can do is to try to protect civilians
here." He said at least five American human shields
are elsewhere in Iraq.

Shockinaw is really Shockinaw City, a small city in northern Michigan
adjacent to the Straits of Shockinaw and not far from Shockinaw
Island, a popular vacation destination. Shockinaw is where two of
the Great Lakes (Lake Michigan and Lake Huron) come together.
As a military strategy, Shockinaw begins by subjecting all Iraqis to
round-the-clock exposure to CNN's Wolf Blitzkrieg and his incessant
monotone, thought to be capable of stunning and pacifying the most
determined resisters.

It is thought that the combined waters of Lake Huron and Lake Michigan,
when introduced into Iraq, will be capable of making the desert bloom,
replacing the dry sands of tyranny with the fruits of democratic choice,
overseen, of course, by a Supreme Court watchfully guarding the nation
from the foolish decisions of an unwise electorate.

Mr. Blitzer is apparently reporting on an anonymous tip that the "Shock & Awe"
campaign of Cheney/Wolfowitz/Rummy will be immediately followed by a Dubya-led
"Aw Shucks" Campaign.  As in, "Aw, shucks, we murdered thousands of children."

Christine--

Just wanted to let you know that, while this essay seems not to
have been noticed much here on the list, I've passed it on to
a number of people, and it seems fairly illuminating to me.

Thanks for posting it.

{    FWD -
{
{
{
{
{
{    *** It's not about oil or Iraq. It's about the US and Europe going
{    head-to-head on world economic dominance. ***
{
{    Summary: Why is George Bush so hell bent on war with Iraq? Why does his
{    administration reject every positive Iraqi move? It all makes sense when you
{    consider the economic implications for the USA of not going to war with
{    Iraq. The war in Iraq is actually the US and Europe going head to head on
{    economic leadership of the world.
{
{    America's Bush administration has been caught in outright lies, gross
{    exaggerations and incredible inaccuracies as it trotted out its litany of
{    paper thin excuses for making war on Iraq. Along with its two supporters,
{    Britain and Australia, it has shifted its ground and reversed its position
{    with a barefaced contempt for its audience. It has manipulated information,
{    deceived by commission and omission and frantically "bought" UN votes with
{    billion dollar bribes.
{
{    Faced with the failure of gaining UN Security Council support for invading
{    Iraq, the USA has threatened to invade without authorisation. It would act
{    in breach of the UN's very constitution to allegedly enforced UN
{    resolutions.
{
{    It is plain bizarre. Where does this desperation for war come from?
{
{    There are many things driving President Bush and his administration to
{    invade Iraq, unseat Saddam Hussein and take over the country. But the
{    biggest one is hidden and very, very simple. It is about the currency used
{    to trade oil and consequently, who will dominate the world economically, in
{    the foreseeable future -- the USA or the European Union.
{
{    Iraq is a European Union beachhead in that confrontation. America had a
{    monopoly on the oil trade, with the US dollar being the fiat currency, but
{    Iraq broke ranks in 1999, started to trade oil in the EU's euros, and
{    profited. If America invades Iraq and takes over, it will hurl the EU and
{    its euro back into the sea and make America's position as the dominant
{    economic power in the world all but impregnable.
{
{    It is the biggest grab for world power in modern times.
{
{    America's allies in the invasion, Britain and Australia, are betting America
{    will win and that they will get some trickle-down benefits for jumping on to
{    the US bandwagon.
{
{    France and Germany are the spearhead of the European force -- Russia would
{    like to go European but possibly can still be bought off.
{
{    Presumably, China would like to see the Europeans build a share of
{    international trade currency ownership at this point while it continues to
{    grow its international trading presence to the point where it, too, can
{    share the leadership rewards.
{
{    DEBATE BUILDING ON THE INTERNET
{
{    Oddly, little or nothing is appearing in the general media about this issue,
{    although key people are becoming aware of it -- note the recent slide in the
{    value of the US dollar. Are traders afraid of war? They are more likely to
{    be afraid there will not be war.
{
{    But despite the silence in the general media, a major world discussion is
{    developing around this issue, particularly on the internet. Among the many
{    articles: Henry Liu, in the 'Asia Times' last June, it has been a hot topic
{    on the Feasta forum, an Irish-based group exploring sustainable economics,
{    and W. Clark's "The Real Reasons for the Upcoming War with Iraq: A
{    Macroeconomic and Geostrategic Analysis of the Unspoken Truth" has been
{    published by the 'Sierra Times', 'Indymedia.org', and 'ratical.org'.
{
{    This debate is not about whether America would suffer from losing the US
{    dollar monopoly on oil trading -- that is a given -- rather it is about
{    exactly how hard the USA would be hit. The smart money seems to be saying
{    the impact would be in the range from severe to catastrophic. The USA could
{    collapse economically.
{
{    OIL DOLLARS
{
{    The key to it all is the fiat currency for trading oil.
{
{    Under an OPEC agreement, all oil has been traded in US dollars since 1971
{    (after the dropping of the gold standard) which makes the US dollar the de
{    facto major international trading currency. If other nations have to hoard
{    dollars to buy oil, then they want to use that hoard for other trading too.
{    This fact gives America a huge trading advantage and helps make it the
{    dominant economy in the world.
{
{    As an economic bloc, the European Union is the only challenger to the USA's
{    economic position, and it created the euro to challenge the dollar in
{    international markets. However, the EU is not yet united behind the euro --
{    there is a lot of jingoistic national politics involved, not least in
{    Britain -- and in any case, so long as nations throughout the world must
{    hoard dollars to buy oil, the euro can make only very limited inroads into
{    the dollar's dominance.
{
{    In 1999, Iraq, with the world's second largest oil reserves, switched to
{    trading its oil in euros. American analysts fell about laughing; Iraq had
{    just made a mistake that was going to beggar the nation. But two years on,
{    alarm bells were sounding; the euro was rising against the dollar, Iraq had
{    given itself a huge economic free kick by switching.
{
{    Iran started thinking about switching too; Venezuela, the 4th largest oil
{    producer, began looking at it and has been cutting out the dollar by
{    bartering oil with several nations including America's bete noir, Cuba.
{    Russia is seeking to ramp up oil production with Europe (trading in euros)
{    an obvious market.
{
{    The greenback's grip on oil trading and consequently on world trade in
{    general, was under serious threat. If America did not stamp on this
{    immediately, this economic brushfire could rapidly be fanned into a wildfire
{    capable of consuming the US's economy and its dominance of world trade.
{
{    HOW DOES THE US GET ITS DOLLAR ADVANTAGE?
{
{    Imagine this: you are deep in debt but every day you write cheques for
{    millions of dollars you don't have -- another luxury car, a holiday home at
{    the beach, the world trip of a lifetime.
{
{    Your cheques should be worthless but they keep buying stuff because those
{    cheques you write never reach the bank! You have an agreement with the
{    owners of one thing everyone wants, call it petrol/gas, that they will
{    accept only your cheques as payment. This means everyone must hoard your
{    cheques so they can buy petrol/gas. Since they have to keep a stock of your
{    cheques, they use them to buy other stuff too. You write a cheque to buy a
{    TV, the TV shop owner swaps your cheque for petrol/gas, that seller buys
{    some vegetables at the fruit shop, the fruiterer passes it on to buy bread,
{    the baker buys some flour with it, and on it goes, round and round -- but
{    never back to the bank.
{
{    You have a debt on your books, but so long as your cheque never reaches the
{    bank, you don't have to pay. In effect, you have received your TV free.
{
{    This is the position the USA has enjoyed for 30 years -- it has been getting
{    a free world trade ride for all that time. It has been receiving a huge
{    subsidy from everyone else in the world. As it debt has been growing, it has
{    printed more money (written more cheques) to keep trading. No wonder it is
{    an economic powerhouse!
{
{    Then one day, one petrol seller says he is going to accept another person's
{    cheques, a couple of others think that might be a good idea. If this
{    spreads, people are going to stop hoarding your cheques and they will come
{    flying home to the bank. Since you don't have enough in the bank to cover
{    all the cheques, very nasty stuff is going to hit the fan!
{
{    But you are big, tough and very aggressive. You don't scare the other guy
{    who can write cheques, he's pretty big too, but given a 'legitimate' excuse,
{    you can beat the tripes out of the lone gas seller and scare him and his
{    mates into submission.
{
{    And that, in a nutshell, is what the USA is doing right now with Iraq.
{
{    AMERICA'S PRECARIOUS ECONOMIC POSITION
{
{    America is so eager to attack Iraq now because of the speed with which the
{    euro fire could spread. If Iran, Venezuela and Russia join Iraq and sell
{    large quantities of oil for euros, the euro would have the leverage it needs
{    to become a powerful force in general international trade. Other nations
{    would have to start swapping some of their dollars for euros.
{
{    The dollars the USA has printed, the 'cheques' it has written, would start
{    to fly home, stripping away the illusion of value behind them. The USA's
{    real economic condition is about as bad as it could be; it is the most
{    debt-ridden nation on earth, owing about US$12,000 for every single one of
{    it's 280 million men, women and children. It is worse than the position of
{    Indonesia when it imploded economically a few years ago, or more recently,
{    that of Argentina.
{
{    Even if OPEC did not switch to euros wholesale (and that would make a very
{    nice non-oil profit for the OPEC countries, including minimising the various
{    contrived debts America has forced on some of them), the US's difficulties
{    would build. Even if only a small part of the oil trade went euro, that
{    would do two things immediately:
{
{    * Increase the attractiveness to EU members of joining the 'eurozone', which
{    in turn would make the euro stronger and make it more attractive to oil
{    nations as a trading currency and to other nations as a general trading
{    currency.
{
{    * Start the US dollars flying home demanding value when there isn't enough
{    in the bank to cover them.
{
{    * The markets would over-react as usual and in no time, the US dollar's
{    value would be spiralling down.
{
{    THE US SOLUTION
{
{    America's response to the euro threat was predictable. It has come out
{    fighting.
{
{    It aims to achieve four primary things by going to war with Iraq:
{
{    * Safeguard the American economy by returning Iraq to trading oil in US
{    dollars, so the greenback is once again the exclusive oil currency.
{
{    * Send a very clear message to any other oil producers just what will happen
{    to them if they do not stay in the dollar circle. Iran has already received
{    one message -- remember how puzzled you were that in the midst of moderation
{    and secularization, Iran was named as a member of the axis of evil?
{
{    * Place the second largest reserves of oil in the world under direct
{    American control.
{
{    * Provide a secular, subject state where the US can maintain a huge force
{    (perhaps with nominal elements from allies such as Britain and Australia) to
{    dominate the Middle East and its vital oil. This would enable the US to
{    avoid using what it sees as the unreliable Turkey, the politically
{    impossible Israel and surely the next state in its sights, Saudi Arabia, the
{    birthplace of al Qaeda and a hotbed of anti-American sentiment.
{
{    * Severe setback the European Union and its euro, the only trading bloc and
{    currency strong enough to attack the USA's dominance of world trade through
{    the dollar.
{
{    * Provide cover for the US to run a covert operation to overturn the
{    democratically elected government of Venezuela and replace it with an
{    America-friendly military supported junta -- and put Venezuala's oil into
{    American hands.
{
{    Locking the world back into dollar oil trading would consolidate America's
{    current position and make it all but impregnable as the dominant world
{    power -- economically and militarily. A splintered Europe (the US is working
{    hard to split Europe; Britain was easy, but other Europeans have offered
{    support in terms of UN votes) and its euro would suffer a serious setback
{    and might take decades to recover.
{
{    It is the boldest grab for absolute power the world has seen in modern
{    times. America is hardly likely to allow the possible slaughter of a few
{    hundred thousand Iraqis stand between it and world domination.
{
{    President Bush did promise to protect the American way of life. This is what
{    he meant.
{
{    JUSTIFYING WAR
{
{    Obviously, the US could not simply invade Iraq, so it began casting around
{    for a 'legitimate' reason to attack. That search has been one of increasing
{    desperation as each rationalization has crumbled. First Iraq was a threat
{    because of alleged links to al Qaeda; then it was proposed Iraq might supply
{    al Qaeda with weapons; then Iraq's military threat to its neighbours was
{    raised; then the need to deliver Iraqis from Saddam Hussein's horrendously
{    inhumane rule; finally there is the question of compliance with UN weapons
{    inspection.
{
{    The USA's justifications for invading Iraq are looking less impressive by
{    the day. The US's statements that it would invade Iraq unilaterally without
{    UN support and in defiance of the UN make a total nonsense of any American
{    claim that it is concerned about the world body's strength and standing.
{
{    The UN weapons inspectors have come up with minimal infringements of the UN
{    weapons limitations -- the final one being low tech rockets which exceed the
{    range allowed by about 20 percent. But there is no sign of the so-called
{    weapons of mass destruction (WMD) the US has so confidently asserted are to
{    be found. Colin Powell named a certain north Iraqi village as a threat. It
{    was not. He later admitted it was the wrong village.
{
{    'Newsweek' (24/2) has reported that while Bush officials have been
{    trumpeting the fact that key Iraqi defector, Lt. Gen. Hussein Kamel, told
{    the US in 1995 that Iraq had manufactured tonnes of nerve gas and anthrax
{    (Colin Powell's 5 February presentation to the UN was just one example) they
{    neglected to mention that Kamel had also told the US that these weapons had
{    been destroyed.
{
{    Parts of the US and particularly the British secret 'evidence' have been
{    shown to come from a student's masters thesis.
{
{    America's expressed concern about the Iraqi people's human rights and the
{    country's lack of democracy are simply not supported by the USA's history of
{    intervention in other states nor by its current actions. Think Guatemala,
{    the Congo, Chile and Nicaragua as examples of a much larger pool of US
{    actions to tear down legitimate, democratically elected governments and
{    replace them with war, disruption, starvation, poverty, corruption,
{    dictatorships, torture, rape and murder for its own economic ends. The most
{    recent, Afghanistan, is not looking good; in fact that reinstalled a
{    murderous group of warlords which America had earlier installed, then
{    deposed, in favour of the now hated Taliban.
{
{    Saddam Hussein was just as repressive, corrupt and murderous 15 years ago
{    when he used chemical weapons, supplied by the US, against the Kurds. The
{    current US Secretary for Defence, Donald Rumsfeld, so vehement against Iraq
{    now, was on hand personally to turn aside condemnation of Iraq and blame
{    Iran. At that time, of course, the US thought Saddam Hussein was their
{    man -- they were using him against the perceived threat of Iran's Islamic
{    fundamentalism.
{
{    Right now, as 'The Independent' writer, Robert Fisk, has noted, the US's
{    efforts to buy Algeria's UN vote includes promises of re-arming the military
{    which has a decade long history of repression, torture, rape and murder
{    Saddam Hussein himself would envy. It is estimated 200,000 people have died,
{    and countless others been left maimed by the activities of these monsters.
{    What price the US's humanitarian concerns for Iraqis? (Of course, the French
{    are also wooing Algeria, their former north African territory, for all they
{    are worth, but at least they are not pretending to be driven by humanitarian
{    concerns.)
{
{    Indonesia is another nation with a vote and influence as the largest Muslim
{    nation in the world. Its repressive, murderous military is regaining
{    strength on the back of the US's so-called anti-terror campaign and is
{    receiving promises of open and covert support -- including intelligence
{    sharing.
{
{    AND VENEZUELA
{
{    While the world's attention is focused on Iraq, America is both openly and
{    covertly supporting the "coup of the rich" in Venezuela, which grabbed power
{    briefly in April last year before being intimidated by massive public
{    displays of support by the poor for democratically-elected President Chavez
{    Frias. The coup leaders continue to use their control of the private media,
{    much of industry and the ear of the American Government and its oily
{    intimates to cause disruption and disturbance.
{
{    Venezuela's state-owned oil resources would make rich pickings for American
{    oil companies and provide the US with an important oil source in its own
{    backyard.
{
{    Many writers have noted the contradiction between America's alleged desire
{    to establish democracy in Iraq while at the same time, actively undermining
{    the democratically-elected government in Venezuela. Above the line, America
{    rushed to recognise the coup last April; more recently, President Bush has
{    called for "early elections", ignoring the fact that President Chavez Frias
{    has won three elections and two referendums and, in any case, early
{    elections would be unconstitutional.
{
{    One element of the USA's covert action against Venezuela is the behaviour of
{    American transnational businesses, which have locked out employees in
{    support of "national strike" action. Imagine them doing that in the USA!
{    There is no question that a covert operation is in process to overturn the
{    legitimate Venezuelan government. Uruguayan congressman, Jose Nayardi, made
{    it public when he revealed that the Bush administration had asked for
{    Uruguay's support for Venezuelan white collar executives and trade union
{    activists "to break down levels of intransigence within the Chavez Frias
{    administration". The process, he noted, was a shocking reminder of the CIA's
{    1973 intervention in Chile which saw General Pinochet lead his military coup
{    to take over President Allende's democratically elected government in a
{    bloodbath.
{
{    President Chavez Frias is desperately clinging to government, but with the
{    might of the USA aligned with his opponents, how long can he last?
{
{    THE COST OF WAR
{
{    Some have claimed that an American invasion of Iraq would cost so many
{    billions of dollars that oil returns would never justify such an action.
{
{    But when the invasion is placed in the context of the protection of the
{    entire US economy for now and into the future, the balance of the argument
{    changes.
{
{    Further, there are three other vital factors:
{
{    First, America will be asking others to help pay for the war because it is
{    protecting their interests. Japan and Saudi Arabia made serious
{    contributions to the cost of the 1991 Gulf war.
{
{    Second -- in reality, war will cost the USA very little -- or at least, very
{    little over and above normal expenditure. This war is already paid for! All
{    the munitions and equipment have been bought and paid for. The USA would
{    have to spend hardly a cent on new hardware to prosecute this war -- the
{    expenditure will come later when munitions and equipment have to be replaced
{    after the war. But munitions, hardware andso on are being replaced all the
{    time -- contracts are out. Some contracts will simply be brought forward and
{    some others will be ramped up a bit, but spread over a few years, the cost
{    will not be great. And what is the real extra cost of an army at war
{    compared with maintaining the standing army around the world, running
{    exercises and so on? It is there, but it is a relatively small sum.
{
{    Third -- lots of the extra costs involved in the war are dollars spent
{    outside America, not least in the purchase of fuel. Guess how America will
{    pay for these? By printing dollars it is going to war to protect. The same
{    happens when production begins to replace hardware. components, minerals,
{    etc. are bought in with dollars that go overseas and exploit America's
{    trading advantage.
{
{    The cost of war is not nearly as big as it is made out to be. The cost of
{    not going to war would be horrendous for the USA -- unless there were
{    another way of protecting the greenback's world trade dominance.
{
{    AMERICA'S TWO ACTIVE ALLIES
{
{    Why are Australia and Britain supporting America in its transparent Iraqi
{    war ploy?
{
{    Australia, of course, has significant US dollar reserves and trades widely
{    in dollars and extensively with America. A fall in the US dollar would
{    reduce Australia's debt, perhaps, but would do nothing for the Australian
{    dollar's value against other currencies. John Howard, the Prime Minister,
{    has long cherished the dream of a free trade agreement with the USA in the
{    hope that Australia can jump on the back of the free ride America gets in
{    trade through the dollar's position as the major trading medium. That would
{    look much less attractive if the euro took over a significant part of the
{    oil trade.
{
{    Britain has yet to adopt the euro. If the US takes over Iraq and blocks the
{    euro's incursion into oil trading, Tony Blair will have given his French and
{    German counterparts a bloody nose, and gained more room to manouevre on the
{    issue -- perhaps years more room. Britain would be in a position to demand a
{    better deal from its EU partners for entering the "eurozone" if the new
{    currency could not make the huge value gains guaranteed by a significant
{    role in world oil trading. It might even be in a position to withdraw from
{    Europe and link with America against continental Europe.
{
{    On the other hand, if the US cannot maintain the oil trade dollar monopoly,
{    the euro will rapidly go from strength to strength, and Britain could be
{    left begging to be allowed into the club.
{
{    THE OPPOSITION
{
{    Some of the reasons for opposition to the American plan are obvious --
{    America is already the strongest nation on earth and dominates world trade
{    through its dollar. If it had control of the Iraqi oil and a base for its
{    forces in the Middle East, it would not add to, but would multiply its
{    power.
{
{    The oil-producing nations, particularly the Arab ones, can see the writing
{    on the wall and are quaking in their boots.
{
{    France and Germany are the EU leaders with the vision of a resurgent, united
{    Europe taking its rightful place in the world and using its euro currency as
{    a world trading reserve currency and thus gaining some of the free ride the
{    United States enjoys now. They are the ones who initiated the euro oil trade
{    with Iraq.
{
{    Russia is in deep economic trouble and knows it will get worse the day
{    America starts exploiting its take-over of Afghanistan by running a pipeline
{    southwards via Afghanistan from the giant southern Caspian oil fields.
{    Currently, that oil is piped northwards -- where Russia has control.
{
{    Russia is in the process of ramping up oil production with the possibility
{    of trading some of it for euros and selling some to the US itself. Russia
{    already has enough problems with the fact that oil is traded in US dollars;
{    if the US has control of Iraqi oil, it could distort the market to Russia's
{    enormous disadvantage. In addition, Russia has interests in Iraqi oil; an
{    American take over could see them lost. Already on its knees, Russia could
{    be beggared before a mile of the Afghanistan pipeline is laid.
{
{    ANOTHER SOLUTION?
{
{    The scenario clarifies the seriousness of America's position and explains
{    its frantic drive for war. It also suggests that solutions other than war
{    are possible.
{
{    Could America agree to share the trading goodies by allowing Europe to have
{    a negotiated part of it? Not very likely, but it is just possible Europe can
{    stare down the USA and force such an outcome. Time will tell. What about
{    Europe taking the statesmanlike, humanitarian and long view, and
{    withdrawing, leaving the oil to the US, with appropriate safeguards for
{    ordinary Iraqis and democracy in Venezuela?
{
{    Europe might then be forced to adopt a smarter approach -- perhaps
{    accelerating the development of alternative energy technologies which would
{    reduce the EU's reliance on oil for energy and produce goods it could trade
{    for euros -- shifting the world trade balance.
{
{    Now that would be a very positive outcome for everyone.

Subject:      Dissent in Des Moines

The peculiarities of the heartland:

In Des Moines, Iowa, at noon, straggling protesters (maybe 75?) met downtown,
under the sculpture of a giant umbrella, holding signs damp from spring mist.
We listened as a radical priest read a plea to troops to give up their guns.
A Quaker sold slogan buttons.  A former ROTC expressed her sadness at our
country gone to war.  A vet wore an anti-war pin next to his purple heart.  A
few homeless men milled about, curious about what was going on in their living
room.  One asked me about the photo of an Iraqi child safety-pinned to my
jacket, then told me, politely, to “enjoy myself”.   We strolled around the
federal building which was fenced in so that workers might reconstruct the
*façade*.  We always, as Midwesterners do, waited for walk signals.

Later, a large Methodist church was packed with stodgy elders, bored children,
well-coifed soccer moms, sincere and blond college students.  Clergy after
clergy addressed their Gods with *shock and awe*, repenting for our country’s
evil.  One clergy assured us we were forgiven, but I don't know who believed
her.  Congregants pinned sack cloth to their clothes.  The order of service
was illustrated with a grainy photocopy of Guernica.  We sang strange,
discomforting, anthems of God’s might.  Grown men, Iowans with faces normally
as orderly as their corn fields, removed glasses to blot chaotic tears.  The
Baptists, the Unitarians, the Catholics linked hands, and there were cookies
in the basement after.

I heard a woman in the pew behind me discussing her plans for civil
disobedience.  I turned around to see an uber-Iowa matron: short puffy graying
hair, conservative floral sweater, tastefully neutral makeup, and a round
honest grief-stricken face.

how about, stephen vincent, collecting your "imagined truths"
newsblurbs into one section of a volume?
how about collecting some of the post 9/11 reports (from charles,
gary sullivan, brian k stefans, lee ann brown etc) into another
section of the volume?
reports on anti-war demos for another?
nick n barrett, ditto for your chain piece and surrounding posts?
anyone interested in publishing it? jane sprague, a la your ammiel
alcalay piece?  miekal xexoxial?
not to put anyone on the spot here, just throwing out ideas.
a different face of "poets against the war" in dialogue and multilogue.

>
>Along with his work on black history and his outspoken

>
>In another public feud, Mr. Aptheker took on the author
>William Styron, after the publication of his best-

>re-creation of the 1831 Virginia slave insurrection.
>Mr. Aptheker, as well as some black writers and
>historians, accused Mr. Styron of distorting the record
>and promoting racial stereotypes. Mr. Styron, who
>called his book a "meditation on history," hotly
>rejected Mr. Aptheker's view, saying it was tainted by

>
>Although he wrote, taught and lectured widely on his
>political views, his only major attempt at elective
>office was an unsuccessful campaign for the House of
>Representatives from Brooklyn in 1966 on the Peace and

>
>Among his lasting contributions was the editing of the

>Book Review, the historian Eric Foner called "The
>Correspondence of W. E. B. DuBois" (Massachusetts,
>1973-1978) "a landmark in Afro-American history."
>
>Yet when DuBois appointed Mr. Aptheker (pronounced AP-

>turned over to him his vast correspondence shortly
>before his death in 1963, the move was vocally

>thought that for DuBois to have chosen an avowed
>Marxist to edit his papers was to make him vulnerable
>to the accusation, often voiced in the McCarthy era,
>that he himself was opposed to the American way of
>life.
>
>Yet Mr. Aptheker's editing was greeted with wide
>praise. Reviewers said that his own extensive writing
>on African-American history had clearly prepared him
>for the task. Jay Saunders Redding, the black author

Except for, in Emerson's case, the annoying ability to grasp facets of
complex issues.

There is a passage in Emerson-- I am recalling from memory a text I probably
haven't read probably since my youth, but it goes something like, "If I am
the Devil's son, I shall sleep in my father's house."

So yes, in this sense, very much.  Though, given the governor's deeply
professed faith, it is a little bit ironic, Mr. Noodle, wouldn't you agree?

Mark, the quote is a bit different: "If I am the Devil's child, I will live
then from the Devil" from "Self-Reliance" - as you can see, not something
George W. Bush would ever even think of saying.  Emerson has to be the
misrepresented writer in world history.  Was it Harry Nudel who said this thing
below comparing him to Bush?  Hey Harry, as usual you don't know what the fuck
you're talking about.  Do yourself a favor, get your head out of your ass and
go read Emerson's antislavery speeches.  -m.

Thanks for your kind thoughts here, Maria. A great idea, a multiple
assemblage contre la querre. Aren't we all "virtual situationists" - of so I
think of the work of the boys & girls who work for Gothix. What a crew! Not
to sound vain, but - like Spicer's Martians - they invade through out the
night, giving this transcriber little rest. But - at the moment - who can
take any time to rest?!!

Any way I am up for asking the Gothix folks for permission to reprint pieces
from the News Service - from virtual to print, what a concept!

To the sound  helicopters - music or threat? - jacking up the skies of San
Francisco. War quickens,

I dunno, Mike.  I would damn well say the period following Sept. 11th was a
low point in our culture & history, what with "orange alerts" (which always
makes me think of the old Clark Coolidge poem that has the line "ounce code
orange") & the USA Patriot Act (ha!-- there's a fine bit of bilge to
inspect).  But now, right now, I read about the heroic resistance that
happened in San Francisco & Philly & DC.  & Here in not-so-sleepy Boulder, I
attended a protest yesterday with some 600 others-- & there were other
events which I didn't make it to.  & My 10 year old daughter knows Bush is a
dangerous idiot, & made a sign which hangs in our window: "War is terrible,
Peace rules."  (Okay, I admit to a little justifiable parental pride here).
& All over I'm seeing people starting to act up, to question what "our
leaders" are saying, even as the sickenly servile media, from Wolf Blitzer
to Scott Simon, tries to spoon feed us the administration's lies.  It's not
enough, but it never is.  However, I know that for every person arrested, &
even for every person who attends a protest, there are many more who
question, & who object to what is going on.  One can see the situation &
despair, but right now I see it & I choose to hope-- because that's maybe
all I can do-- that this will politicize a lot more USAmericans, & that this
in turn will result in some change.  War is all-encompassing, as Williams
pointed out, & its horror & might dwarf us.  All we have is the ability to
keep telling the truth, & the hope in the end that it make a difference.

conference in Jamaica

Forwarded message:


Greetings,


At the suggestion of Ms. Lynn Pitts here at Sarah
Lawrence College, I am writing to inform you of the
2003 Summer Poetry Alliance (August 15-22nd) in
Negril, Jamaica. I am organizing this event on behalf
of WILDE (Women Into Literature Development and
Economics) an international non-profit organization
aimed at empowering Africana women in developing
countries.


Right now, I am looking to connect with experienced
women of African descent (undergraduates, graduates
and professionals) from all over the country that
would be interested in the opportunity to facilitate
workshops or deliver a paper in exchange for free
lodging and meals (as well as discounted travel and
conference fees).

I would very much appreciate you passing this link on
to anyone who you might think would be interested in
attending as a faciliator or lecturer. Those simply
interested in more details as a regular participant
should email me so i can have a comprehensive emailing
list as more details become available.

http://www.geocities.com/wilde2000beyond/SUMMERPOETRYALLIANCE

Cordially,
Paury Flowers (Coordinating Intern for WILDE)

i have only posted to this list once,(and i am pretty
sure i dont know anybody on it) a long time ago, but i
keep reading it and have appreciated it especially in
the past few weeks when sharing information and
thoughts about the war has been increasingly important
and necessary. i wasin san francisco visiting family
over the weekend and felt the tremendous energy ofthe
people there who are committed to keeping the message
of peace alive and open for discussion, and i felt
like the day the bombs were dropped, that energy would
explode, and it has. i feel like this list has
similarly inspiring intensity, an energy that has kept
consistent and interesting all the way through. so as
sort of an observer, i wanted to thank all the people
who keep up with it so thouroghly.
i am currently in southern ontario for a few more
weeks and am volunteering at a unicef sponsored
learning center, where our focus in education is
peace. it was with a heavy heart that i talked with
children today about how important peace and peaceful
dissent are. but i cannot fully believe in that today
for as i talk with them about the efforts of rigoberta
menchu or martin luther king, massive explosions
destroy a city, where countless children live and are
victims of my county's total abondonment of peace and
discussion. i can only march in the streets and keep
the voice of peace alive, but there is nothing else i
can do for those who are voiceless.
here is an interesting page, made up of brave people
committed to helping the people their tax dollars are
being spent to destroy, a commitment i can only
imagine the bravery of. bay area people note: a man
from boulder creek ( in the santa cruz mountains, i
think i used to serve him coffee when i lived there)
is in iraq as part of the team. check out his journal.
check out the 'voices in the wilderness' link on the
page.

 take care,
jb

"Earlier this month, the federal government raised the official terror -"

"Other evidence has been gathered. Other people have spoken.
When that happens, sometime you need to revisit people to ask questions"

If he knows that man, it's but a knowledge of surface. He
can't penetrate beneath the stitched brow, nor see into eyes
that can't see into eyes, nor turn up that frown with a touch

"The mounting debt comes at a time when the federal gov-
ernment, tightening the squeeze on the state and local officials
to raise taxes, cut services or both. 'This borrowing pushes the
cost of our problems today onto our children tomorrow'"

"Church teachings recommend keeping a year's worth of grains, beans
and other basics on hand. Grains: Wheat, 748 pounds; flour, 70
pounds; cornmeal, 153 pounds; rolled oats, 173 pounds; rice, 329
pounds; pearled barley, 15 pounds; spaghetti or macaroni, 163

Just one more victim that they allowed. I save everyone green.
Guys like you kick my ass once I leave the club. Slip or socks,
medium. What kind of mood do you suggest? There just
might be a chance that Washington's right. Sounds like a prayer
but it's damn appropriate. I just sit around scratching myself
for 24 hours. He's not going to give up what we can't find

This is the mouth of spring, a long wave of mouths moving
north puddle by puddle. These are the lips parting but inseparable,
pouting but poised to kiss. These were the teeth of winter, fallen,
flattened out in a wavering line. This was a tongue, this will again
be a tongue, now over saturated, limp, mute.  This is a throat,
a hollow, with a promise of voice.  This is a breath, these
are breaths, growing effortless, holding it all together

Just a short note from Australia. Protests happening here too, someone wrote
No War in red on the tip of the Opera House, I haven't made it into Sydney
as my back decided to go into spasm the day the war broke out. The same day,
the sky was full of dust, blown up from Melbourne (a couple of thousand
kilometres away) very strange atmosphere, the kids (I'm a school teacher)
stirred up.
One is in the odd position of hoping the coalition are successful as soon as
possible simply to avoid loss of life. Like many of you, however, I find the
aftermath even more worrying, too many unknowns and the knowns e.g. the
character of the current US Government, suggest the "liberation" of the
Iraquis may not make it out of inverted commas.
And let me echo all those who've said how valuable the list is in times like
this, both for the information it provides but also for letting us all know
that people of like minds are out there, even if they don't make it onto the
TV screens. I don't know how Australia is perceived in the US; if, indeed,
it's even thought of. Our government is as aggressive and hypocritical as
any in pursuit of this war but it doesn't represent the people. There's a
strong sense in the media here that support for the war is much more
widespread among the US population so it's particularly encouraging (though
not surprising - as I think Robert Byrd said, there was a time when the US
had a capacity to inspire the world) to find out that there is opposition.
A hopeful note: although the worldwide opposition has not been able to
prevent the war, I hope that it can keep up the pressure so that the US and
its allies might behave themselves a little more circumspectly both during
and after. A negative rejoinder is about to kick in -

Nothing else to say.

Perhaps Auden has made this memorable aphorism more factual, but certainly

 20.03.03, Bilkent University, Ankara, Turkey

=20

Suddenly, after months of thinking about war but having nothing besides =
the media to focus our attention on it, there are signs of it everywhere =
we look. I returned home from school yesterday to discover notices in =
the lobby of our building outlining security procedures for air attacks. =
"Apparently there's a bomb shelter in the next building," Glenys said =
with an eghads look.=20

=20

It's highly unlikely there will be any spillover of this conflict into =
Turkey. Although it is possible that Turkey will soon be engaged in a =
conflict of its own with the northern Iraqi Kurds. We're not hearing =
much about what it currently happening at the Turkey-Iraq border.

=20

A pair of men tested the generators in a nearby building this morning. =
They rumbled to life with the clanky growl of an old mechanical beast =
that's been hibernating. A short while later, as Euan and I were doing =
our usual Magpie count out the window, a jet roared over the campus at =
great speed heading southeast, as if to confirm that Turkey has indeed =
opened its airspace to coalition forces. Vanloads of Jandarma tool =
around the area incessantly. We start to try to interpret these signs.

=20

Being a new dad in times like these is an uncanny and confusing =
experience. It's jarring to look at my son and see so much innocence and =
wonder and be thinking about people dying and suffering off in the =
distance. I told my son what was happening because we always tell him =
everything that's happening ("Daddy's licking oatmeal off his thumb =
Euan!"). Again I had Oppen to put some texture to this feeling I have =
for my son with regard to the war:

=20

My daughter, my daughter, what can I say=20

Of living?

=20

I cannot judge it.

=20

We seem caught=20

In reality together my lovely

Daughter

=20

Meanwhile, life goes on, but in a much different way, with a much =
different feeling to it, naturally. I greeted one of my students =
yesterday and asked her how she was. "Uptight," she said. It's difficult =
to teach or sit for classes when your mind is elsewhere. I sit in my =
office and stare off into space for periods of time, my mind reeling. =
When I snap out of it, I realize I must get my act together, and I start =
to scurry in my head even more.=20

=20

I've made last minute adjustments to the syllabus of my American Poetry =
class in an attempt to keep focus on both poetry and the war. I put =
Oppen's Of Being Numerous, Williams' Introduction to The Wedge, and =
selections from Reznikoff's Testimony on for this week. This work has =
generated good discussion and, to the extent that they want to, has =
allowed my students to use class discussions as a forum for their =
thoughts and feelings about the war.

=20

On Thursday's class I read from Of Being Numerous and asked my students =
to listen with an ear toward the poem and with an ear toward Baghdad, to =
see if this poem in any way enabled them to focus on the war. When I =
asked them if the poem helped or hindered their attempt to focus on the =
war several students said they went into and out of focus about the war, =
but that the poem helped them focus on experience and what that is. How =
do you experience something you're not experiencing? If war is =
meaningless, then what is poetry?=20

=20

I read the Williams stuff I posted to the list on Thursday. Poetry isn't =
a turning away from the war, it is the war, "merely a different sector =
of the field." How can that be?=20

=20

We talked about objectivism as a poetry of attention. Attention to the =
very facts of existence and to time, what that dialectic produces in the =
mind and in language.=20

=20

We had also read for that day selections of Charles Reznikoff's =
amazingly affecting poem Testimony. Two students introduced the poem and =
got a discussion going about the discrepancy between the lack of emotion =
in the language and the deeply emotional effect that that language =
produces when you read it.=20

=20

Then a student named Berna compared the poems to "the media," to news. I =
told the class about one of Pound's definitions of poetry: "Poetry is =
news that stays news." It turned out to be the perfect way to account =
for the relevance of reading a poem that was published in the 60's, and =
which incorporated images of WW2 and Vietnam, to focus our attention on =
a war that was happening while we were talking.

=20

I ended class about 8 minutes early, but then something very unexpected =
happened. None of my students got up to leave. None of them even =
stirred. There was a short silence and then another student picked up =
the discussion again, and we continued talking as if class was still in =
session.

=20

But the atmosphere in the room had changed completely. I was no longer =
presiding and everyone was there by choice. The classroom turned into a =
meeting place. What a freaky feeling it was to have everything change so =
dramatically like that with no apparent activity to produce it. I felt a =
lot calmer after this class than I have in days. The two students who =
exited the classroom with me told me in Turkish to take good care =
("kendine iyi bak"). Normally they just say, in English, "See you."=20

I've just been working on this, and in no way regard it as finished, but I
would appreciate any comments or suggestions. What the piece is trying to do
is to find a language that expresses psychological dissolution. Also it is
trying to inhabit the borderlines of poetry and prose. I hasten to add that
it is a work of fiction!

THE CLOUD

It was hard not to recognise the boundaries as they misted off nor too the
brumous dissolution of form that lifted from my maps with a cheap perfume's
insistence. Liked her, it said, nudge nudge. That slow ungirdling, cor.

No, no, not that, my better head said, and somevoice that might be termed
mind turned to whatever it was to find out what it might be.

A witch, rhymes with ....., a curse, a voice breathed to which the
dictionaries prompted  'borders', 'attach', 'defence, 'definition', oh you
thesaurian certitudes, not that any of those mean the former, they then that
then , with the ugliness of Old English 'th's, fixed themselves, like a
spider to a web.

Not sense, not rational that I complained as somevoice within said she'd put
a hex on me. Hex? I asked, that rhymes with ....

There is too much rhyming I reflected but she? No, not her, never. Who had
tried to steal my soul. Who had wanted to make me an adjunct of her
emptiness, like a shrunken head hanging from a kangaroo skin hat. No, no,
not her.

And the wind blew cold
                                     and a blue cloud rose
as a bat-wing rustle
                               twittered over the vacancies
and alleyways of care.

No one has ever accused Dallas of being a bastion of progressive thought,
and here's evidence of why. There's a very popular local chain of "French
countryside" cafes here called La Madeleine. On any given day the places are
packed with people from early morning through lunch and at dinner. I stopped
by one location a few mornings ago for a cup of French roast and a pastry on
the way to work.

I was one of two people in the whole joint. I asked one of the employees why
so slow, and she just shrugged and said "boycott." I had heard of no boycott
and inquired further. Apparently there is a de facto boycott going on around
Dallas of any business that sounds remotely French. The most amazing part of
all this is that there was no need to publicize or promote this boycott; all
the French-haters just knew to steer elsewhere. Is this happening in Ft.
Worth, too, Herb?

I'm off to La Madeleine,
Brian

So I just heard something like a 70% approval rating for the war, and I
can't help but wonder where these figures are coming from; I mean not to
wear my conspiracy-theory gear, but how many of the folks on this list have
been polled? And doesn't it seem that as a physiological tool the figures
could possibly sway folks? Just a thought...

have you ever been polled???

maybe the polling companies are working for the pentagon, but the fact that
nobody on this list has been polled means absolutely nothing. polls depend
for their accuracy on a random sampling of the population (just what a
random sampling is is of course open to conjecture) but leaving that aside
for the moment, because it is random the size of the sample is irrelevant
and indeed, polls usually never interview more than a thousand people. often
(as is the case in the poll i think you are citing) less than five hundred
people are interviewed. so the chances of anyone on this list being
interviewed are pretty slim...but on the up side, because the sample
randomly constituted, the "collective political stance" of the list, if we
can say that there is one, was most likely represented by at least one
person who was interviewed. i know that this doesn't seem intuitively
correct to some people, that somehow a REALLY large sample- say a million
-should produce a more accurate result. but if that sample is chosen
randomly, the result will not be more accurate, but more precise.
apologies for the long-winded reply. i am wired on green tea and war news.

 Writers
Reading Series.

Arts and the National Poetry Foundation. She has lectured in creative
writing at Tufts University, Emerson College, Columbia, Yale, University of
California San Diego, and MIT.


Praise for Fanny Howe:
This complexly articulate writer uses poetry as a final resource. All the
authority of her power becomes explicit in [her] poems, the musing,
twisting thoughts and persons woven into a meld of great force and
beauty. This is life if it could speak. Here it does.=94
--Robert Creeley


=93There is a dizzying wildness is Fanny Howe=92s work that draws the reader
headlong across her page. In the unstoppable rush of that language she
unites the dispersed elements of our tumbling humanness. O Guerilla
poet! She has loosed the physical bonds of our daily bread. There is no
telling where she takes us after we=92ve arrived.=94
--Maureen Owen


=93Fanny Howe is the closest thing to Emily Dickinson since Dickinson
herself.
--Albert Gelpi


=93Howe is a sly, wicked poets, always shifting between the social, the
political, as well as the linguistic and literary concerns of an artist
always writing from the cutting edge.=94
--Quincy Troupe


=93Fanny Howe=92s strangely hushed but busy landscape keeps leading us into=
 it
until we realize we=92re lost but wouldn=92t want to be anywhere else=85. A
strange joy.
--John Ashbery

Mike,

I found your e-mail on Emerson incredibly heartening.  It reminded me
that American ideals have always had an uphill fight against American
realities--Manifest Destiny, slavery, now I think some uniquely American
form of world empire--and yet somehow manage to find a voice.  How much
that voice is worth, how hard-won.

I think too of how much our poetic owes to war resistance;  the lying
rhetoric of WWI that soured a generation on the Victorian platitudes of
honor, duty, country.  That language is one of the first casualties of
war--'smart bomb,' 'axis of evil,' 'terrorist,' 'shock and awe,'
'coalition of the willing,' 'operation:  freedom, infinite justice,
desert shield,' 'rogue state'--is a truth that hits home with the force
of a bunkerbuster right now.  Just using the language as truthfully as
we can, as poets, as Americans, and like you say, pointing out where it
lies, has a value that perhaps none of us can see quite clearly now.  I
bet Emerson couldn't.  Thanks for the much-needed history jolt.

For those of you who aren't on WOMPO:

things to do:

-  get out the Larousse Gastronomique and start cooking
-  blog in French

I might add:  read the Germ French issue; visit Double Change; attend
Guy Bennett's conference at USC (in LA, CA) April 4-6...

when Jerome Rothenberg was here, he was already eating a lot of Brie, he
said, and planning a spring in Paris...

Most of the media seems to be focussing on Iraqis who are all for the
liberation of Iraq, this is one of the few Ive found so far which gives
a different perspective.  A small excerpt below:

"I am so angry," he said, before pausing to watch the latest bombs fall
on his native city.

"They're bombing a historical city. They're more than terrorists.

"This day is a disaster for Iraqi history, just like Sept. 11 was for
the United States."

Hashim left Iraq in 1995 because he said he felt Hussein's regime was
constantly suspecting him of disloyalty.

An abstract artist who refused to paint images of Iraq's dictator, he
said leaving the oppressive regime was one of his life-long dreams.

"One of my biggest dreams was to get away from there. I felt I was
always suspected because I was not part of the regime," he said
Thursday.

On the other hand, Hashim said, he has conflicting feelings of love for
his home country because of its history and the role it had in shaping
him.

Also, did anyone else catch Alice Walker on Bill Moyer last night.  I
have to say that the sense of peace & conviction emanating from her was
quite a startling contrast to the inescapable puke & hurl of the
embedded Propaganda enslaught.  More than once she returned her commets
to being in a garden feeling peace, a very apt connection for these
times since paradise gardening originates in the Tigris-Euphrates.

cbs/ny times poll indicates that 93% of repubs favor this war, but
only 50% of dems (at the start of the first gulf war it was 81%
dems)... equiv. split between repubs and dems re support of bush...
cnn/usa today poll results were similar...

all of which indicates, among other things, a partisan split of
significant proportions... but in any case, a divided country, and if
"only" 30% of people in this country are opposed to the war, that's
still a large number of people, esp. large in historical terms for
the start of military operations...

there's no way the u.s. is going to pull out now, and one hopes of
course for a speedy resolution of conflict with minimal casualities
all the way around... seems to me the protestors are doing some good
in any case by keeping pressure on the administration... this time
'round we can say with some confidence that

the whole world is watching...

best,

I was arrested yesterday afternoon in downtown SF. Poet Travis Ortiz just
happened to be in the same group when we got popped -- I had literally just
run from Geary alongside a phalanx of riot cops being deployed to the scene,
taking pics with digital camera as I went. The brilliant "dragnet" that
snared us was two lines of police on either side of us trying to drive us
simultaneously in opposite directions -- the dozen or so folks thus trapped
were only saved from being bludgeoned by one alert officer who screamed
"WHAT ARE YOU DOING!!!" at cops in the opposite line. The Keystone Kops
never gave us a chance to disperse, thus capturing such mastermind criminals
as a 20-something preppy New Yorker who had been shopping in Crocker
Galleria and just wanted to get to a meeting at five o'clock, and various
other tourists or yokels who were in the wrong place at the wrong time.

We were cuffed, put in a police bus, held about five hours in a huge
warehouse at Pier 27, cited, and released. There was a shifting crowd of
about 300-400. Much more on this later, but the key points are

1) those who professed some kind of medical condition were cited and
released fairly quickly. the rest of us were deliberately held until
nightfall to discourage us from joining the evening rally.

2) there was a clear tactic of arresting EVERYONE who happened to be on the
streets whether you were actively blocking traffic or not, again with the
idea of discouraging people from returning the next day for fear of
prosecution. this pattern was repeated with the later protest, whose members
were arriving just as we were released. BUT there were several people in the
friday group who had been arrested thursday, and they were released just
like the rest of us. those who refused to give names were held separately
and taken to county, but word was they were released without being cited at
all, although held overnight.

3) if you are going to san francisco, aside from being sure to wear flowers
in your hair, be prepared to be arrested today. don't bring anything
valuable or fragile that might get smashed if they take you. do bring a cell
phone, water, and something to eat. once they arrested us, the police
treated us fine, aside from a few cops who thought they had to be cute.

best,

DH

Yes, to echo Halvard's remarks, I was very struck by the Heard essay, and my
thanks to Christine for passing it on. Likewise, I've shown it to a number
of people, including one who is a rather senior figure in the British Green
Party, and they too were particularly taken by certain points, especially
the remarks about the oil-dollar.

Christine--

Just wanted to let you know that, while this essay seems not to
have been noticed much here on the list, I've passed it on to
a number of people, and it seems fairly illuminating to me.

Thanks for posting it.

1988: Prior to this year, George Bush Jr. is a failed oil man. Three times
friends and investors have bailed him out to keep him from going bankrupt.
But in this year, the same year his father becomes President, some Saudis
buy a portion of his small company, Harken, which has never worked outside
of Texas. Later in the year, Harken wins a contract in the Persian Gulf and
starts doing well financially. These transactions seem so suspicious that
even the Wall Street Journal in 1991 states it "raises the question of ...
an effort to cozy up to a presidential son." Two major investors into Bush's
company during this time are Salem bin Laden, Osama bin Laden's father, and
Khaled bin Mahfouz. [Salon, 11/19/01, Intelligence Newsletter, 3/2/00]
Khaled bin Mahfouz is a Saudi banker with a 20% stake in BCCI, a bank that
will go bankrupt a few years later in the biggest corruption scandal in
banking history (see July 5, 1991). In 1999 Mahfouz will be placed under
house arrest in Saudi Arabia for contributions he gave to welfare
organizations closely linked to bin Laden. [Boston Herald, 12/11/01] The
sister of Mahfouz is married to Osama bin Laden. [Washington Post, 2/17/02]

June 4, 1992: It is reported that the FBI is investigating the connections
between James Bath and George Bush Jr. Bath is Salem bin Laden's official
representative in the US. "Documents indicate that the Saudis were using
Bath and their huge financial resources to influence US policy," since Bush
Jr.'s father is president. Bush denies any connections to Saudi money. What
became of this investigation is unclear. [Houston Chronicle, 6/4/92]

April, 1999: A Saudi government audit shows that five of Saudi Arabia's
billionaires have been giving tens of millions of dollars to al-Qaeda. The
audit shows that these businessmen transferred money from the National
Commercial Bank to accounts of Islamic charities in London and New York
banks that serve as fronts for bin Laden. $3 million was diverted from a
Saudi pension fund. The only action taken is that Khalid bin Mahfouz,
founder of National Commercial Bank, Saudi Arabia's biggest bank, is placed
under house arrest. Bin Mahfouz had invested in George Bush Jr.'s businesses
starting in 1989. The US has not frozen the accounts of bin Mahfouz, and he
continues to engage in major oil deals with US corporations. [USA Today,
10/29/99, Boston Herald, 12/10/01]

January 21, 2001: George Bush Jr. is inaugurated as the 43rd US President,
replacing Clinton. The only major figure to permanently remain in office is
CIA Director Tenet, appointed in 1997 and reputedly a long time friend of
Bush Sr. FBI Director Louis Freeh stays on a few more months, until June
2001. Numerous figures in Bush's administration are directly connected to
the oil industry. Over 50 of Bush's new staff are later shown to have worked
for Enron. [Salon, 11/30/01]

from http://www.itszone.co.uk/George-W-Bush.htm

Personal Note:
bin Mafouz denies virtually every claim made about him, and does so on his
own web site, with a special FAQ page.  However, given his diminished
credibility ( two big factorsL 1) his association with BCCI and 2) his
desperate need as a businessman to restore confidence) I wouldn't believe a
word he says.

Osama bin Laden's older brother, Salem bin Laden, heir to the Binladen
Group, and his father, Muhammed, both died in suspicious small craft plane
accidents over Texas.  Muhammad in 1968, over Prez Bush I's oil fields, and
Salem, 20 years later, in Texas as well, taking off from a Bush-owned
airfield.

Glad you found it worthwhile Rodney!  Emerson's antislavery writings are so
goddamn inspiring I can't tell you - a guy with unsurpassed intellectual
ability throwing himself whole hog into political speechmaking - can you
imagine if we had some equivalent of that today what it might mean to everyone?
Anyway, if you want to read my full gush about this and your library has
RARITAN you can check out my article "Emerson's Emancipation Proclamations in
20:4 (Spring 2001), pp. 96-116.  Peace,  -m.

Whoops, meant to send this just to Rodney, where it might have sounded less

After peeing and meditating, I broke my fast with yogurt and tofu.  Then
I jogged to the Starbucks, found a nice clean table and had just one
latte and a cinnamon-raisin bagel.  It's quite peaceful this early in
the morning after the schoolbuses have left the neighborhood, so I read
a little out of _Haiku for Passages_.  Then I did a few pilates in the
parking lot and some tai-chi on a promontory overlooking the Pacific
Ocean, forgiving the offshore rigs and blessing their crews.  Jogged
back home and fired up the Braun - the cats were so kittenish as they
jumped and ran away!  While the expresso accumulated, I had my one
morning joint and made notes for today's poetic/politico entry (which is
below under 10:20 p.m.).  The expresso was delicious and I cleared my
mind of everything for its jolt.  The problem these days is no one takes
time to appreciate a moment, such as the delicious irony of the CNN
banner running left to right in its reflection on my computer screen.
The other reality was that "raw" was really "war."  But I remembered the
cypress on the promontory, leaning away from eons of ocean breeze, and
was comforted knowing it would still be there after all the bodies were
buried.  And, yes, I jogged back there and wept.

I'm watching because, quite frankly, I want to know what this "shock and
awe" is/are all about.  Though I try concentration exercises, that CNN
ticker (called it "banner" yesterday but I understand that in this case
terms are interchangeable) is distracting.  Is it old news, or is it
news that is newer than what's on the screen?  I asked my reading group
over tonight to pray and chant and think good thoughts.  We'd been
revisiting The Hitchhiker's Guide so we could interrogate presumptions
about universal views, and after torturing that we decided The Ring was
more appropriate since some of our leaders appear to act as if they have
magical powers.  We lit some incense and meditated a bit before we tried
to tackle that. There was a cat on every person's lap.  We took it as a
sign and discussed everything in polite low tones.  "Don't droop old
crocus/Spring's new snow will melt so soon/See summer's new frock,"
interrupted Maegann with impromptu haiku.  That was a signal it was time
for tea, so we all unfolded from lotus position and put the t.v. on mute.

I'm still up.  Surrendered to a Morrocan last night whose dream was of
the 7th Cavalry riding sheep into "Big Little Horn."  Multiculturalism
has always been my bag - I even fly a UN flag on my '98 Celica.  M. Arum
says I'm lucky I live in a liberal neighborhood.  At any rate, I
recommend reading the Upinashads and the Bible to throw light on this
whole mess and to stay away from .com sites as they have an agenda and
are written by the same people who give Ari Fleisher his Cliff Notes.  A
certain nostalgia washing over me now as I think of those slim
yellow-bound volumes and how they helped clarify Thomas Stearns Eliot
for me, not to mention the sexual politics of Madame Bovary and the
"other" so deeply embedded in Crime & Punishment.  I'm thinking of
reviving them as Cuff Notes for our Time, or Klept Notes for our Time on
copy-protected CDs.  By the way, you can buy single electric candles for
your windows at any of those dollar stores.  Which reminds me:  Have you
felt your tv lately?  My Trinitron is quite warm so I've turned it off
for a while.  I urge you to do the same.  We can't afford to lose what
may be our only link to the outside world.

It was too much.  And of course the biggest booms got replay.  I've
invited my friend Maegann to come watch the Oscars with me tomorrow.  I
want The Hours to win everything.  I want to go to San Francisco.  I
want to go sit beneath my leaning cypress and be able to look across the
sea.  I'm going to invent something called the pithyram.

I have to report a witness embedded in the ocean time zone. Radly the

elethumps of crass dissection, chumical septums surrendering en masse,
tracers, fussed storms, ticker brain. It makes since we metal wave
freedom sands. Maegann has candles, charred at work to get it done.
Have a tummy frank. All across America today it is like the new days
because finally angry at media and it had to cover itself.   Driving
here I saw expeditions, explorers, excursions, navigators, escapes,
tahoes, yukons, and avalanches.  The largest precision ever.  They drove
to demonstrate.  GO, JERRY!

Yes, thank you for invoking Emerson, who is good at anytime ("every word was
once a poem").  To add to the discussion, I suggest a little known text by
Stanley Cavell, titled, This New Yet UnApproachable America: Lectures after
Emerson after Wittgenstein, published by the Living Batch Press of
Albuquerque in 1989 (Gus Blaisdale).  Cavell has done a great deal to
legitimate Emerson as a philosopher.  Also, Richard Poirier, a literary
scholar, has a fine book The Renewal of Literature: Emersonian Reflections,
Yale 1988 that reads American literature through Emerson thinking.

Best, Gloria Frym

As always, what concerns me is the demographics of the split, which are by
no means easy to define but nonetheless mark the boundaries in our ongoing
cultural war. Jews, for instance, are divided 50-50, with the proponderance
of war supporters among the most  orthodox. In this group education is not
a marker, as it tends to be in the northeast, less educated whites tending
to back the war, although that backing is more among men than women.  White
christian fundamentalists are overwhelmingly in favor, and their numbers
are especially strong among the less educated in the southeast. Most
minority groups are not in favor. In the mountain states education is less
of a factor. One could go in. Groups of people who would be uncomfortable
living next to  each other line up on the same side of a range of issues,
from snowmobiles in national parks to phonics to war. The issues themselves
are often, like party membership, more identification markers than
convictions based on thought--they are part of one's uniform in the
cultural war. One can always be sure that it's "them" who oppose,
demonstrate, etc. This works as well in reverse, of course. But it's hard
not to feel superior on our side to the large mass on the other whose grasp
of language is so faulty that they're convinced that Saddam is behind Al Queda.

Here's another division worth talking about. We now have a professional
standing army, consisting, as it did before WWII (but it was then only a
quarter million strong, and its weapons were primitive), of an officer
class recruited from among those with the clout to get recommended to the
academies, and grunts self-selected from among the less privileged, less
educated. They are separated for most of their careers from the communities
and classes in which they were raised and largely isolated by their
transience from the non-military communities around their bases. So an
institutional culture develops. This seems to me very dangerous. Charles
Rangel's [sic?] suggestion that we reinstate a universal draft begins to
make a lot of sense.

Jim,
   If you're out there, I'd like your e-mail address. My friend Mary Rose
mentioned that you may be doing a Portland, Oregon issue of "can we have our
ball back?". Is this true? If so, do you have a date in mind for publication?

Thanks,

        Deep Concerns
      =20
        by Noam Chomsky; March 20, 2003 =20

    At this grim moment, we can do nothing to stop the=20
ongoing invasion.  But that does not mean that the task is=20
over for people who have some concern for justice, freedom,=20
and human rights.  Far from it.  The tasks will be more=20
urgent than before, whatever the outcome of the attack. =20
And about that, no one has any idea: not the Pentagon, the=20
CIA, or anyone else.  Possibilities range from the=20
horrifying humanitarian catastrophes of which aid and=20
relief agencies that work in Iraq have been warning, to=20
relatively benign outcomes -- though even if not a hair is=20
harmed on anyone's head that will in no way mitigate the=20
criminality of those willing to subject helpless people to=20
such terrible risks, for their own shameful purposes.

    As for the outcomes, it will be a long time before=20
preliminary judgments can be made.  One immediate task is=20
to lend what weight we can to more benign outcomes.  That=20
means, primarily, caring for the needs of the victims, not=20
just of this war but of Washington's vicious and=20
destructive sanctions regime of the past ten years, which=20
has has devastated the civillian society, strengthened the=20
ruling tyrant, and compelled the population to rely on him=20
for survival.  As has been pointed out for years, the=20
sanctions therefore undermined the hope that Saddam Hussein=20
would go the way of other murderous tyrants no less vicious=20
than he. That includes a terrible rogues gallery of=20
criminals who were also supported by those now at the helm=20
in Washington, in many cases to the last days of their=20
bloody rule: Ceausescu, to mention only one obvious and=20
highly pertinent case.

    Elementary decency would call for massive reparations=20
from the US; lacking that, at least a flow of aid to=20
Iraqis, so that they can rebuild what has been destroyed in=20
their own way, not as dictated by people in Washington and=20
Crawford whose higher faith is that power comes from the=20
barrel of a gun.

    But the issues are much more fundamental, and long=20
range.  Opposition to the invasion of Iraq has been=20
entirely without historical precedent.  That is why Bush=20
had to meet his two cronies at a US military base on an=20
island, where they would be safely removed from any mere=20
people.  The opposition may be focused on the invasion of=20
Iraq, but its concerns go far beyond that.  There is=20
growing fear of US power, which is considered to be the=20
greatest threat to peace in much of the world, probably by=20
a large majority.  And with the technology of destruction=20
now at hand, rapidly becoming more lethal and ominous,=20
threat to peace means threat to survival.

    Fear of the US government is not based solely on this=20
invasion, but on the background from which it arises: An=20
openly-declared determination to rule the world by force,=20
the one dimension in which US power is supreme, and to make=20
sure that there will never be any challenge to that=20
domination.  Preventive wars are to be fought at will:=20
Preventive, not Pre-emptive.  Whatever the justifications=20
for pre-emptive war might sometimes be, they do not hold=20
for the very different category of preventive war: the use=20
of military force to eliminate an imagined or invented=20
threat.  The openly-announced goal is to prevent any=20
challenge to the "power, position, and prestige of the=20
United States." Such challenge, now or in the future, and=20
any sign that it may emerge, will be met with overwhelming=20
force by the rulers of the country that now apparently=20
outspends the rest of the world combined on means of=20
violence, and is forging new and very dangerous paths over=20
near-unanimous world opposition: development of lethal=20
weaponry in space, for example.    =20

    It is worth bearing in mind that the words I quoted are=20
not those of Dick Cheney or Donald Rumsfeld or other=20
radical statist extremists now in charge.  Rather, they are=20
the words of the respected elder statesman Dean Acheson, 40=20
years ago, when he was a senior advisor to the Kennedy=20
Administration.  He was justifying US actions against Cuba=20

arises in the case of a US response to a challenge to its=20
"power, position, and prestige," specifically terrorist=20
attacks and economic warfare against Cuba.

    I bring this up as a reminder that the issues are=20
deep-seated.  The current administration is at the=20
extremist end of the policy-planning spectrum, and its=20
adventurism and penchant for violence are unusually=20
dangerous.  But the spectrum is not that broad, and unless=20
these deeper issues are addressed, we can be confident that=20
other ultrareactionary extremists will gain control of=20
incredible means of devastation and repression.

    The "imperial ambition" of the current power holders,=20
as it is frankly called, has aroused shudders throughout the
world, including the mainstream of the establishment at=20
home.  Elsewhere, of course, the reactions are far more=20
fearful, particularly among the traditional victims.  They=20
know too much history, the hard way, to be comforted by=20
exalted rhetoric.  They have heard enough of that over the=20
centuries as they were being beaten by the club called=20
"civilization."  Just a few days ago, the head of the=20
non-aligned movement, which includes the governments of most
of the world's population, described the Bush=20
administration as more aggressive than Hitler.  He happens=20

Washington's international economic projects.  And there is=20
little doubt that he speaks for many of the traditional=20
victims, and by now even for many of their traditional=20
oppressors.

    It is easy to go on, and important to think these=20
matters through, with care and honesty.

    Even before the Bush administration sharply escalated=20
these fears in recent months, intelligence and=20

the threats by paying some attention to legitimate=20
grievances, and by agreeing to become a civilized member of=20
a world community, with some respect for world order and=20
its institutions.  The other way is to construct even more=20
awesome engines of destruction and domination, so that any=20

My old friend Gene Frumkin in Albuquerque claims to have seen
Lynda and me on TV this afternoon--in loin clothes, in Washington
Square Park, so I figured I'd better nip this vile canard in the bud.

We indeed were there, though our line of march (east on Bethune
St. to Bleecker St., where we paused at Bleecker Park to gaze at
the millions of kids swinging, climbing the jungle gyms, playing in
the sandbox, etc., and continued on to the Biography Book Store
at the corner of Bleecker and W. 11th Sts., where we scanned the
sale books on the outside tables, after which we proceded on along
Bleecker, across Seventh Ave.--yea, verily, even unto Carmine St.,
where we briefly detoured southward to the Unoppressive Books
Store--one of our favorites, not only because they figure the sales
tax into an even-dollar price so it almost seems like we're not
paying any sales tax at all--and then, with a new Kathy Acker
title in two, across Sixth Ave., along the dog-leg of Minetta St.
and a short job to MacDougal St., where we turned left and
walked the few remaining blocks--thick with marchers who had
already finished their march and were dispersing outward from the
square and into various and sundry of the Village's eating and
watering spots--to the park itself) didn't take us down B'way
from Herald Square or even farther uptown near Times Square
if not above that. We'd seen that scene at home on TV (NY1
and FoxNews5 had great helicopter shots showing *masses*
of people pouring down B'way from as far as the eye could see.
So, sluggards that we are, we met the march in Washington
Square Park (fully clothed, I might add, although the afternoon
was balmy to the max, our first great Saturday of spring. This
was . . . oh, around two o'clock-ish, maybe somewhat later.
And the permit for the march was to expire at four. So we
went past a few knots of NY's finest manning the barricades,
steering vehicle traffic away from the park, or just hanging
around keeping an eye on things. No horse, no riot gear--
not that we saw anyway. We crossed MacDougal and pressed
into the crowds in the park--a huge mix of marchers and, I
suppose, the usual first-Saturday-afternoon-of-spring folks,
who, I imagine, had gotten there early enough to get dibs on
all the benches. There were signs and slogans and weird get-
ups galore, believe. Even the dogs (some of them) wore T-
shirts with slogans on them. Near the outer ring around the
park's central fountain (not fountaining) a guy near a table
of leaflets and brochures was, through a bullhorn, waxing
loquacious on some non-pacifistic program he was touting
(he wasn't a loony, but I don't quite remember what his
program was). Even nearer the outer ring around the
desiccated fountain, a gang of marchers with musicians
(mostly percussive) were beating their hands together and
whipping themselves into a frenzy (as I thought, though it
was a peaceable frenzy with something Dionysian about
it, which made me think of spring rituals--the city is full
of amorous pigeons nowadays--and, with the dark-blue-
garbed minions of Gotham law clustered near the park,
I couldn't help but think of Ginsberg's poem about that
party at Ken Kesey's place in one of those canyons above
LA as police sat outside in their cars with blue lights spinning,
and about Hawthorne's maypolers, doing their spring thing
as dour Puritans glared from the woods) as Lynda and
I circled around to the right of them and sat down on the
low concrete wall of that outer ring. Susan Sherman, one
of Lynda's old friends, like her a teacher at the Lang College
of the New School University, stopped, sat down and
chatted with Lynda for a long time, as I got out a pen and
started jotting down some of the best slogans I'd seen--
slogans like "Dissent Protects Democracy," and "Look,
Daddy. I made a war," and "Fermez la Bush" (this last one
of a number having a Fr*nch theme), and "Pro-American
and Anti-war" (this one pretty close to something I'd used
recently as an email sign-off), and "Iraq 2003, Poland 1939,"
(which depended, I thought, a bit too heavily on Americans'
frail memory for past events), and "Lesbians Against Boys
Invading Anything," (which struck me as a double-duty
slogan that was both compact and funny), and (this one
I didn't see but got from John Tytell who stopped briefly
to greet us and reported it) "Think with your head, not
with your Dick, Bush and Colin," and while jotting these
down I noticed and pointed out to Lynda a camcorder
dangling, dancing about, from a huge, red helium balloon,
the line to which was caught in the branches of a tree.
When we left the park, that camera was still up there, and
marchers were still streaming into the park, many dispersing,
some staying on, more still arriving. On Sixth Ave., police
cars galore, paddy wagons (as they used to be called)
galore. We walked up to Greenwich Ave. and headed
west, stopping for a coffee at our local Starbucks (yes,
just live with it, will ya?). And we got home about four
and turned on the TV and heard that, although the permit
had expired, marchers on B'way still extended all the way
up to . . . well, I'm forgetting now . . .  but Herald Square,
I think. Maybe Times Square. I watched an hour program
on NewsWorld during which Evan Solomon (a great
interviewer, in my humble opinion) and a roundtable of
American Muslims discussed the Koran, and then turned
to NY1 where the first reports of fracassing in the park
were just being aired--the maceing of police, etc. etc.
Still a quarter million marchers this afternoon (NY1's
numbers) and, last I heard, some forty-five arrests.

Just to let you know, in case you're traveling this week,
that Lynda and I are off to Chicagoland this morning.
We'll be heading south on Washington St. to Spring St.,
east on Spring to Varick and south on Varick to the
Holland Tunnel. In New Jersey, we'll be taking US 1/9
to Harrison Avenue and Harrison Avenue to I 280,
which will carry us to I 80, which we'll take all the way
to the environs of Frankfort, Illinois, where the kidz
and grandkidz live. There'll be brief rest stops along
the route, and, most likely, an overnight somewhere in
the vicinity of Sandusky, Ohio. Come on, we're too
old to do it all in one go anymore. Give us a break.
Keep your eyes on the road.

The return trip will be much the same, but in reverse,
with an overnight in western Pennsylvania. That'll
commence Friday morning.

Hal                Serving the tri-state area.

All:

WWII was a legal war. Germany declared war on us, then Congress made a
formal, constitutional, declaration of war. Since then wars have been
"police actions," in which this country wasn't in peril, its ideology was.
The invasion of Afghanistan was not constitutional but a vigilante action,
invading a country, whose repressive government we helped to create (in a
long line of repressive governments we helped to create), and to whom we
were sending money until 9/11. We were after one man, at least that was the
excuse. It could have been done other ways. It is not that it's bad that the
Talidan is gone, for the moment at least, but that this was the prelude to
the invasion of Iraq, another illlegal vigilante action with the excuse of
taking down one man. This is frontier justice, and George W. Bush is the
hanging judge. Problem is, the Old West is gone, only these guys don't know
it.

Bringing someone to justice is noble, something I, and I think most people,
support. But murder is murder, whether a state does it, or a person, whether
this country, Israel, or the Mafia puts out a contract on someone's life. It
is not strange that since the Reagan Administration, many of those players
are in the current administration, we have rejected and ignored the World
Court, have put ourselves above international law, as our power has outgrow
our maturity.
 As for violence, this is an interesting subject that begins, really, in the
individual amygdala. We can even say that wars are an expression of the
collective amygdala. I think that there is a time to fight, when you are in
peril, and what probably bothers protestors most is what Senator Byrd said,
that this is a war of choice, not necessity. When a society reaches this
point, when it tries to solve its internal problems with external wars,
something has gone very very wrong.

The daily news sources I get most of my info from aren't reporting Iraqi
civilian casualties. Here's a website, which I found through a
guardian.co.uk link, which is attempting to estimate minimum and maximum
numbers of Iraqi dead using a variety of mainstream international
outlets:

http://www.iraqbodycount.net/bodycount.htm.

The current minimum and maximum count of those killed by U.S./British
attacks are 68 and 98.

American demonstrators!

-- You're not demonstrating for yourself - you're demonstrating to provoke
positive change. You want to change the way things are. You have goals you
want met. You're willing to act to meet those goals.
-- March in an orderly fashion. Indicate you're a soldier for peace.
Rioting releases energy, but does not advance the cause.
-- Dress somberly, even in black. Don't turn the march into a circus. You
don't want to be dismissed as crazy. Indicate you're part of a massive
upwelling of public opinion. Show you're part of the public. Indicate
you'd put your life on the line for the cause of peace. Show you're as
serious and brave as a soldier in war.
-- Carry out symbolic actions such as flag and effigy burning. Do these
with the sacredness of serious metaphor. Remember your symbolic targets at
all times.
-- Forget clever signs and costumes. They entertain but distract. Silence
itself can be a weapon. A straightforward sign gets a message across. You
must unnerve the enemy.
-- Realize that the world outside the US is watching. You must indicate
the resistance from within, as strongly as possible. You must make the
leaders of the US realize you are part of a force that must be contended
with.
-- Be careful in your support of violence, but never assume that Gandhi's
era is our own.
-- Know your enemy. Become knowledgable. Read as much as you can on the
current crisis and its roots. Read the texts of your enemy as well.
-- Do not assume that any large gathering of people makes a difference
unless it makes a difference.
-- Choose your targets carefully. A demonstration for or against numerous
causes may well be weakened by an accumulation of messages that may even
be contradictory. Remove auxiliary issues or religious and other rhetoric.
Focus.
-- Prepare for the long haul. Speak loud but clearly. Let there be no
mistake.
-- Leave your armchair for the production of resistance. Involve others.
Spread the word. Contact others.
-- Never give up. Never give in to false pessimism or optimism. Remain a
realist at all times.
-- Provoke.

Anne,

maybe another way of looking at it is when the machine starts to break,
so does the need for perfect grammar..

what is the difference between proper grammargodandcountry... none...
it is all oppressive and based on an oppressive order................

One central aspect about war per violence is how much it depends on the
individual "amygdala" assimilating the "collective" or larger amygdala as
ideology, as you say.  There is a disconnect there between individual and
collective that the personal, individualized, combatant must be trained to
ignore or there cannot be any such violence called war.  Such violence
depends on the fine tuning or disciplining of an impersonal response from
the otherwise personal/person.

And yes, poets can't easily address this as a rhetorical form, it seems to
me, because poetry often tries to be a form that asks for some kind of
rhetorical strategy and commitment that lives and speaks *consciously in (at
least) both these worlds*--the subjective and the collective.

Interesting, then, to see how we all (as poets) respond--that is, in what
ways does the poetry tell something about what the heck a poet is for?
Because beyond that, what can poetry really do?

Yup, and so seen even by the founding fathers, who were adamantly against
standing armies. So for most of our histories we had tiny professional
armies that could function as the core of larger groups gathered (until the
civil war always by enlistment) in the event of conflict. Hence the
constitution's interest in the maintenance of an armed citizenry.  In the
current world that won't work--things happen too quickly, and the arms are
too complex and too deadly--we can't gather and train masses of  enlistees
or draftees fast enough to respond--so more forces at the ready are needed
even if the US never fights another war of aggression (yeah, right).

But my own sense is that a universal draft, say for a year as the French do
it, could be a great force for change. If the kids were detached from their
home environments and thrust among the full diversity of their age group
under military discipline (to keep them from killing each other) a lot of
the divisions that plague us would begin to disappear.  Military
discipline, but not necessarily  military assignment--there's plenty for a
modern CCC to do, here and abroad. And for those who need it there could be
a gun-to-the-head (hey, it's a metaphor) last shot at literacy training,
with none of the distractions of civilian life.

I raised this on the list a couple of years ago to a chorus of howls from
folks who I'm afraid had a hard time dealing with the thought of not being
in school for one year of their lives.

A Letter from Michael Moore to George W. Bush on the Eve of War


George W. Bush
1600 Pennsylvania Ave.
Washington, DC


Dear Governor Bush:

So today is what you call "the moment of truth," the day that "France and
the rest of world have to show their cards on the table." I'm glad to hear
that this day has finally arrived. Because, I gotta tell ya, having survived
440 days of your lying and conniving, I wasn't sure if I could take much
more. So I'm glad to hear that today is Truth Day, 'cause I got a few truths
I would like to share with you:

1. There is virtually NO ONE in America (talk radio nutters and Fox News
aside) who is gung-ho to go to war. Trust me on this one. Walk out of the
White House and on to any street in America and try to find five people who
are PASSIONATE about wanting to kill Iraqis. YOU WON'T FIND THEM! Why?
'Cause NO Iraqis have ever come here and killed any of us! No Iraqi has even
threatened to do that. You see, this is how we average Americans think: If a
certain so-and-so is not perceived as a threat to our lives, then, believe
it or not, we don't want to kill him! Funny how that works!

2. The majority of Americans -- the ones who never elected you -- are not
fooled by your weapons of mass distraction. We know what the real issues are
that affect our daily lives -- and none of them begin with I or end in Q.
Here's what threatens us: two and a half million jobs lost since you took
office, the stock market having become a cruel joke, no one knowing if their
retirement funds are going to be there, gas now costs almost two dollars --
the list goes on and on. Bombing Iraq will not make any of this go away.
Only you need to go away for things to improve.

3. As Bill Maher said last week, how bad do you have to suck to lose a
popularity contest with Saddam Hussein? The whole world is against you, Mr.
Bush. Count your fellow Americans among them.

4. The Pope has said this war is wrong, that it is a SIN. The Pope! But even
worse, the Dixie Chicks have now come out against you! How bad does it have
to get before you realize that you are an army of one on this war? Of
course, this is a war you personally won't have to fight. Just like when you
went AWOL while the poor were shipped to Vietnam in your place.

5. Of the 535 members of Congress, only ONE (Sen. Johnson of South Dakota)
has an enlisted son or daughter in the armed forces! If you really want to
stand up for America, please send your twin daughters over to Kuwait right
now and let them don their chemical warfare suits. And let's see every
member of Congress with a child of military age also sacrifice their kids
for this war effort. What's that you say? You don't THINK so? Well, hey,
guess what -- we don't think so either!

6. Finally, we love France. Yes, they have pulled some royal screw-ups. Yes,
some of them can be pretty damn annoying. But have you forgotten we wouldn't
even have this country known as America if it weren't for the French? That
it was their help in the Revolutionary War that won it for us? That our
greatest thinkers and founding fathers -- Thomas Jefferson, Ben Franklin,
etc. -- spent many years in Paris where they refined the concepts that lead
to our Declaration of Independence and our Constitution? That it was France
who gave us our Statue of Liberty, a Frenchman who built the Chevrolet, and
a pair of French brothers who invented the movies? And now they are doing
what only a good friend can do -- tell you the truth about yourself,
straight, no b.s. Quit pissing on the French and thank them for getting it
right for once. You know, you really should have traveled more (like once)
before you took over. Your ignorance of the world has not only made you look
stupid, it has painted you into a corner you can't get out of.

Well, cheer up -- there IS good news. If you do go through with this war,
more than likely it will be over soon because I'm guessing there aren't a
lot of Iraqis willing to lay down their lives to protect Saddam Hussein.
After you "win" the war, you will enjoy a huge bump in the popularity polls
as everyone loves a winner -- and who doesn't like to see a good
ass-whoopin' every now and then (especially when it 's some third world
ass!). So try your best to ride this victory all the way to next year's
election. Of course, that's still a long ways away, so we'll all get to have
a good hardy-har-har while we watch the economy sink even further down the
toilet!

But, hey, who knows -- maybe you'll find Osama a few days before the
election! See, start thinking like THAT! Keep hope alive! Kill Iraqis --
they got our oil!!

Yours,

Michael Moore

Christine:

I agree with you about the individual amygdala assimilating the collective
amygdala, an interesting twist on Jungian neuropsychology.

What is a poet for? So many things: artist, healer, entertainer, visionary,
intellectual...
What can poetry do? It's all language the government puts out, some of it
actually interesting, even brilliant, like "coalition of the willing." The
right-wing is not made up of stupid people, only people trapped in their
little egos, afraid to come out and play in the world except with they feel
secure, playing by their own rules. They know that whoever controls the
language and its means of distribution controls how most people see the
world. What seems to be happening now with the peace demonstrations is a
move toward getting into the discussion again, something the left lost after
Vietnam. Those slogans waved in the peace marches are a  beginning. It's
back to simple language.
My question to this list is: Language Poetry was founded on a platform of
progressive politics. How can it contribute to, does it have anything to
contribute to, the political dialogue now? Or is it just sophisticated
word-play?

After Blenheim

It was a summer evening,
Old Kaspar's work was done,
And he before his cottage door
Was sitting in the sun;
And by him sported on the green         5
His little grandchild Wilhelmine.

She saw her brother Peterkin
Roll something large and round,
Which he beside the rivulet
In playing there had found:             10
He came to ask what he had found
That was so large and smooth and round.

Old Kaspar took it from the boy,
Who stood expectant by;
And then the old man shook his head,    15
And with a natural sigh--
"'Tis some poor fellow's skull," said he,
"Who fell in the great victory.

"I find them in the garden,
For there's many here about;            20
And often when I go to plough
The ploughshare turns them out.
For many thousand men," said he,
"Were slain in that great victory."

"Now tell us what 'twas all about,"     25
Young Peterkin he cries;
And little Wilhelmine looks up
With wonder-waiting eyes;
"Now tell us all about the war,
And what they fought each other for."   30

"It was the English," Kaspar cried,
"Who put the French to rout;
But what they fought each other for
I could not well make out.
But everybody said," quoth he,          35
"That 'twas a famous victory.

"My father lived at Blenheim then,
Yon little stream hard by;
They burnt his dwelling to the ground,
And he was forced to fly:               40
So with his wife and child he fled,
Nor had he where to rest his head.

"With fire and sword the country round
Was wasted far and wide,
And many a childing mother then         45
And newborn baby died:
But things like that, you know, must be
At every famous victory.

"They say it was a shocking sight
After the field was won,                50
For many thousand bodies here
Lay rotting in the sun;
But things like that, you know, must be
After a famous victory.

"Great praise the Duke of Marlbro' won, 55
And our good Prince Eugene"--
"Why 'twas a very wicked thing!"
Said little Welhelmine;
"Nay-nay, my little girl," quoth he,
"It was a famous victory.               60

"And everybody praised the Duke
Who this great fight did win"--
"But what good came of it at last?"
Quoth little Peterkin.
"Why that I cannot tell," said he,      65
"But 'twas a famous victory."

I prefer a concept of world and/or national service rather than one that

(education, medical, environmental, etc.) is criminal. Once the Bush group
is gone (now that's a faith-based assumption!) social system-paralysis will
be epidemic with the exception of funding for the military.   I think it's

Of course. I guess I wasn't sufficiently clear--in my fantasy only a small
number would serve their draft in the military per se.

I thought that I would throw out idea of violence and war this list serve
because not everyone who is thoughtful agrees with the idea that war is
always wrong or that these wars are wrong.  Regarding some of the posts
about stealing oil and oppression in the middle east it seems to me that we
ought to ask about our Saudi Friends and we also ought to ask if our support
for Israel and its horrible treatment of Palestinians has caused allot of
this?  But again other than writing poems and marching how do we address
these issues? The fact is this Islamic Fundamentialists hate what we are
doing here and Economics is not the cause of everything.

Green Circle, Wyoming Promotes Anti-War Protests

(Gothic News Service, 03/23) Green Circle, Wyoming =AD about 20 miles distant
from the State Capital of Cheyenne =AD is actively promoting a weekly and
locally popular series of protests against the continued war in Iraq, as
well as other such possible wars. Green Circle =AD for those unfamiliar with
this wonderful ski, fishing and hunting resort =AD is located about twenty
miles away from Jackson Hole,  a competing tourist dependent town that also
includes many second homes owned by prominent members of the Bush
Administration. Both towns, however, share a common problem. Ever since
9-11, tourism is way down and their economies are in the dumps.
   "Add to the fear of an Al Qaeda attack on Jackson Hole=B9s community
members," Green Circle Mayor Jim Robbins says, "Visitors coming in on a
plane will arrive at what some say will soon be called the Dick and Lynne
Cheney Airport and proceed by car on Highway "43", as in short for Presiden=
t
George Bush, Junior."
   Green Circle apparently had to come out and say "No" in a big time way.
Up on the cliff-side of the Mountain over-looking the town=B9s entrance, an
"Out of Iraq" sign is imprinted in iridescent lavender chalk that even
shines in the dark. Inside town, street signage is radically altered.
General Patton Drive =AD which leads to the outskirts location of the three
acre Wal-Mart Store =AD is now called "End the Conquest Boulevard." The stree=
t
that circles the City Hall building and dome is called "Negotiation Drive."
A City run Peace Center is located on "Diplomacy Works Avenue, " an artery
that is limited to bicycles, solar and electronic vehicles. The "Alice
Waters" pedestrian bridge crosses over the Snake River to "Green Circle
Community Gardens." By now you are probably getting the picture.
   "This City decided that to protest war in Iraq =AD and to protest every
other pre-emptive war this Administration has up its sleeves =AD is the
primary way we as a community will start to neutralize the dark sides of
both Al Qaeda and the Bush people."
   "How does that advantage Green Circle?"
   "By taking ourselves out of that dialogue, we not only further the cause
of Peace, but we also make community attractive and safe to visit. Do you
think Al Qaeda wants to terrorize a community of anti-war activists? I bet
if you talk to the Mayor of San Francisco today =AD he might not say it
publicly =AD but those City businesses already see the benefits of Anti-War
Protests. Of any American City, this summer San Francisco will be the
destination of tourists from countries around the world, particularly  thos=
e
who want a  non-terrorist experience. Watch that City=B9s dead economy
revive."
"The only problem that remains for Green Circle is that visitors may still
have to arrive here by way of a Cheney Airport, a Bush Presidential Drive
and Jackson Hole. We=B9re actually planning alternative routes."

Earth Poem

A dull evening in a run down village
Eyes half asleep
I recall thirty years
And five wars
I swear the future keeps
My ear of corn
And the singer croons
About a fire and some strangers
And the evening is just another evening
And the singer croons

And they asked him:
Why do you sing?
And he answered:
I sing because I sing

And they searched his chest
But could only find his heart
And they searched his heart
But could only find his people
And they searched his voice
But could only find his grief
And they searched his grief
But could only find his prison
And they searched his prison
But could only find themselves in chains

Emily Dickinson of my time."
       Does anyone know the precise source from which this pronouncement
comes?  Does Williams say this directly in his writings?  Was it passed along
to Niedecker via Zukofsky?  Any help would be much appreciated.

Best, Gloria Frym

Gloria,

Someone else may have something more specific than the following bit of
clues, but look into Marjorie Perloff's "Canon and Loaded Gun" from Poetic
License, which quotes Gilbert Sorrentino as saying that Niedecker wrote
"remarkable poetry, as in Catullus and Emily Dickinson."  Also in the same
Perloff essay and notes, not only do the Zukofsky letters connect/conflate
LN with ED, but the Cid Corman correspondence does, too. Perloff suggests
the Jenny Penberthy edition of the Zukofsky, and the Lisa Pater Faranda on
Corman.

Peacekeeper*

I wandered lonely as a missile
That floats on high o’er vales and hills
When all at once I saw a crowd
A host of crimson reeds
Across the desert, in the marshes
Fluttering and breaking in the breeze

Cold as the stars that shine
And twinkle on the muddy way
They stretched in never ending line
Along the margin of life
Ten thousand saw I at a glance
Tossing their heads in deadly dance

The cameras beside them danced, and they
Out-did the sparkling bombs in glee
A missile could not be but gay
In such a jocund company
I gazed and gazed but little thought
What wealth the show to me had brought

For oft when in my shell I lie
In explosive or in hollow mood
They flash upon that inward eye
Which is the mirror of night sky
And then my heart with remorse fills
And bleeds with the crimson reeds


*”Peacekeeper” is the actual name given to a type of
intercontinental cruise missile (with a conscience)
capable of carrying atomic warheads

The French ended conscription a while ago:
http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/1414033.stm. Most of Europe (the most
right-wing part I think it might be fair to say) seems to be following suit.

"Bring back conscription" was a common complaint of my father's generation when
he was disgusted at the behaviour of the young - and he was conscripted for 2
years in the Royal Army Medical Corps.

As to the efficacy of your proposed plan, the experience of the UK postwar
conscription might be instructive. Listening to a radio 4 documentary on this
subject, it appeared that conscription *replicated" and *enhanced* society's
divisions - e.g. any bootneck that showed any sign of an education or an accent
was, apparently, booted upstairs pronto.  IMO, the armed forces (particularly in
the UK; others may want to comment on the US), *reflect* the divisions of
society rather than some some unclass system. If you want social engineering,
then the whole structure has to be changed.

Roger.

--of course this is mine; i'm so embarrassed. how can anyone control or
strategize demonstrations. in a democracy we are free to express
ourselves. i don't know where harbor is or what r.a.c. is for that matter.
i'm always afraid to express myself. my rage comes out in other ways. this
is one of them. one dreams of attack/pursuit against the right. one dreams
of putting them out of our misery. but it's dreamwork and that's all. no
good comes of it.
--in life i'm a coward. i live in the dreamwork. i'm afraid of jail,
arrest, gestapo. i don't know how to play the system. i'm afraid of dying
constantly. i want to help but i can't even help myself. i publish under a
pseudonym. there is no helmut paul. at least there is no helmut paul that
sent me this.  but helmut paul sounds properly other - at the same time
within the aegis of europe - therefore neither one nor the properly other.
--i believe rallies do little good. they show the rest of the world that
there is patriotism in the u.s. but - at least under the present regime -
it results in little practical results. we change nothing. we insist on
our communality. we march and discuss. the war will continue as base and
superstructure smash intermediary cultural play.
--then again this is a selfish belief, perhaps an excuse for not doing
more, not acting on my convictions. clearly ultra-violence will change
things, most likely for the worse. in any case, i'm not capable of that. i
understand the fury of those who are arrested. at least they carry out
their frustrations against authority, however misplaced. i'm not even
capable of that. if someone told me two plus two don't equal four, i'd
believe it. i'm ready to fall for anything.
--i'm a sick man... something is wrong with my mind. i can't carry on and
can't expect anyone else to. i'm horrified by the progress of the war.
what if it were me firing or being fired upon. how can anyone live with
those images sent daily across the internet - those reports, interviews,
analyses, diatribes. yet i continue on as if i'm capable of a writing that
makes a difference beyond my limits. i don't carry a gun for either side.
i can't even hunt. i went fishing one time and that was it. i couldn't
watch the animal suffocating in the air. now it's all of us who are
suffocating. i still don't carry a gun.
--i only clear the air. the text below is mine. i'm sorry if i misled
anyone. i take full responsibility. it was a bad thing to do. i can no
longer speak for myself. i don't know what is right or wrong. i hate the
evil in the world. i only hate it. i don't act. i don't act.--

I come out and Speak! I speak the Truth! The American Demonstrators!
They learn the Truth! Valour and Courage shall Win! Cowardice and Fear
are Out! Prepare the Berms! Hurrah for our Troops Overseas!
Hurrah Hurrah!

"American Demonstrators!

"-- You're not demonstrating for yourself - you're demonstrating to
provoke positive change. You want to change the way things are. You have
goals you want met. You're willing to act to meet those goals.
-- March in an orderly fashion. Indicate you're a soldier for peace.
Rioting releases energy, but does not advance the cause.
-- Dress somberly, even in black. Don't turn the march into a circus. You
don't want to be dismissed as crazy. Indicate you're part of a massive
upwelling of public opinion. Show you're part of the public. Indicate
you'd put your life on the line for the cause of peace. Show you're as
serious and brave as a soldier in war.
-- Carry out symbolic actions such as flag and effigy burning. Do these
with the sacredness of serious metaphor. Remember your symbolic targets at
all times. Saddam! Irak!
-- Forget clever signs and costumes. They entertain but distract. Silence
itself can be a weapon. A straightforward sign gets a message across. You
must unnerve the enemy.
-- Realize that the world outside the US is watching. You must indicate
the patriotism from within, as strongly as possible. You must make the
leaders of Irak realize you are part of a force that must be contended
with.
-- Be careful in your support of violence, but never assume that Gandhi's
era is our own.
-- Know your enemy. Become knowledgeable. Read as much as you can on the
current crisis and its roots. Read the texts of your enemy as well.
-- Do not assume that any large gathering of people makes a difference
unless it makes a difference.
-- Choose your targets carefully. A demonstration for or against numerous
causes may well be weakened by an accumulation of messages that may even
be contradictory. Remove auxiliary issues or religious and other rhetoric.
Focus.
-- Prepare for the long haul. Speak loud but clearly. Let there be no
mistake.
-- Leave your armchair for the production of resistance. Involve others.
Spread the word. Contact others.
-- Never give up. Never give in to false pessimism or optimism. Remain a
realist at all times.
-- Provoke.

Pentagon is "extremely happy" with war coverage so far

Los Angeles Times/Washington Post

Military bosses like what they're seeing and reading about the war, but
critics question the balance and sensitivity of the coverage, say Josh
Getlin and David Wharton . "For some, the reality of death and mayhem
has been lost amid the high-tech imagery beamed into American living
rooms," they write.

Just like George, I've only heard Go To Guy used in a sports context. I've heard it used in football(running back or pass receiver), basketball(high scorer in any position) & baseball(usually a relief pitcher).

Folks,

A couple thoughts.

I appreciate Mike Magee's constant linking between writing and politics (often
via Emerson); I hope this listserv continues to attend to those linkages as
much as to locating alternative (political and otherwise) narratives, since I
think the difficult work as poets is in how to interact with these narratives
and glutting information feeds.

Last year, I requested folks to send me poems from the Gulf War, and there
were a few, but really no more than a trickle.  To date, three anthologies
have been published already in opposition to this war (one called Enough
edited by Scalapino, another due from Nation books by Sam Hamill's crew, and
then the "Poets Against the War" one that began as an online chapbook), and
even Faber and Faber is apparently putting one out.  We're living in an
important time for poetry as action.

Every war is different, and all our expectations and understandings of war are
belated; hence the difficulty of writing poetry "responding" to the war at
hand.  Even Barrett Watten's scrupulously Zukovskyian "thinking with things as
they exist" in Bad History has elements of belatedness; for example, his first
section on the war suggests that even the most "present" writing is
interpenetrated by past and future.

My experience of this war--as attenuated and partial as it is, due to my work
and family--is that it is the first internet war.  If Gulf War I was the first
"live television" war (versus Vietnam's taped television war), then this is
the first internet war; unprecedented access to international media,
marginalized medias, first-hand accounts, threaten to diminish the highly
censored and scripted coverage from American television news.  No doubt, the
major media are very much in place, "embedded" (in bed with?) the Pentagon's
version of reality, and still hegemonic, but the internet is now offering
greater opportunities than ever to contest (if not supplant) the narratives as
they are forming.  For example, the existence of online diaries from Iraq is
unprecedented; while our struggle is always to find some way of checking the
reality of any such perspective, at least we now have things such as
Electronic Iraq's "moon shot of alternative news"".  I offer a couple of links
below for your perusal.

Veteran ITV News correspondent Terry Lloyd, who

to the British television network ITN, which produces ITV
News. The other two journalists who disappeared with
Lloyd, cameraman Fred Nerac and translator Hussein Othman,
are still missing. The following report is by Hani Sabra,
Middle East and North Africa researcher for the Committee

LETTER TO NPR: IRAQ PARADING PRISONERS OF WAR
Hugh Sansom, Electronic Iraq (23 March 2003)

"Even now, there is little NPR attention to the broad
horrors of war, especially for civilian victims. It can't
be that difficult to investigate. European journalists
have visited Iraqi hospitals." Hugh Sansom challenges NPR
to visit the other side of the tracks.

Electronic Iraq -- found at http://electronicIraq.net --
is a joint publication from veteran antiwar campaigners

Peace,

p.s.
Mr. Nudel's admonishment regarding Iraqi civilian casualties stands in direct
contradiction to his gloating over the possibility of war--so much so, that I
have begun to wonder whether the name Nudel is in fact a fictional performance
on the level of Yasusada.  To wit, the last name Nudel is an anagram for
Luden; clearly, all messages from said Nudel are ludic in nature, often
relishing his oppositional-to-the-list posture.  The ludicity climaxed in his
repartee with Mr. Behrle ended with promises of mutual fucking (fuckings-over
or self-fuckings), all before the penetration of Iraq.

You are absolutely right, Joe. I have told the Gothix folks they got to keep
doing their fact checking - which is no big deal, given a couple of clicks
on Google. Shrinking the west - imaginatively or otherwise - is not
something any of us should support.

In periods of large-scale conscription the US military, on the other hand,
served as a democratizing force.  WWII and the Korean war had a strong
determinative effect on the subsequent civil rights movement, for instance.
Vietnam was rather different--the middle class was largely exempt. Whart
I'm proposing is a universal, no exemptions at all, conscription. As the US
military could only aqbsorb a small number, most would wind up in various
civil roles--teaching, building where necessary, etc. There is certainly an
overwhelming need. The infrastructure of our national parks, for instance,
is falling apoart from financial neglect, and in our local property tax
based educational system most schools are understraffed.

A one-year conscription has its limits--a few months would have to go for
training. But the brevity of the term would mitigate the hardening of any
class structure among the conscripts. And my guess is that the experience
would lead a fair number to opt for some form of public service career.
Regardless, a year teaching in an impoverished school system, a yeaqr of an
urban kid's life spent in a national park, a year mixing with a
multiracial, multireligious, multiclass cohort couldn't fail, it seems to
me, to help  break down some of the toxic barriers in American life.

My father, who had never been more than a hundred m,iules from his native
Brooklyn before WWII, told me of fellow-soldiers who marvelled that he
didn't have horns, because they assumed that all Jews did. If nothing else,
he and his barracks-mates learned that they were all human. Still no small
feat in the US.

But of course, tghe whole structure would have to change before anything
like my proposal could actually happen--within the US context it reeks of
subversion.

Torture is part of a long list of concerns about the Bush administration's=

respect for international law, after the extrajudicial killing of al-Qa'ida=

President Bush appeared to encourage extra-judicial solutions in his State=

arrested or meeting "a different fate". "Let's put it this way," he said in=

a tone that appalled many, "they are no longer a problem to the United=20

Mirakove Relay #3: On Detainees

We knew before the illegal invasion of Iraq began that the U.S.
government would be pushing legislature through Congress, and we agreed
that we'd have to pay attention to that. (Please note: This is not a
war; Patriot II itself states that the U.S. has not been involved in a
war in more than 60 years.) While we mourn for those who are suffering
and dying under weapons of mass destruction, let's remain close in our
communities and active in our dialogues.

WE ARE ALL TERRORISTS
The first page alone of the Domestic Security Enhancement Act (aka
Patriot II) is off-the-charts alarming. In defining terrorism, Section
101: Individual Terrorists as Foreign Powers reads, "This provision
would expand FISA's definition of "foreign power" to include *all*
persons, regardless of whether they are affiliated with an
international terrorist group, who engage in international terrorism."

Proceeding to Section 102: Clandestine Intelligence Activities by Agent
of a Foreign Power: "FISA currently defines "agent of a foreign power"
to include a person who knowingly engages in clandestine intelligence
gathering activities on behalf of a foreign power -- but only if those
activities "involve or may involve a violation of" federal criminal
law. Requiring the additional showing that the intelligence gathering
violates the laws of the United States is both unnecessary and
counterproductive.. Any person who engages in clandestine intelligence
gathering activities for a foreign power would qualify as an "agent of
foreign power," regardless of whether those activities are federal
crimes."

"Clandestine"?

"Intelligence"?

So, with law out the window, how are these offenses qualified, and by
whom? If detainment is at the sole discretion of the Attorney General,
and detainees are not only denied the right to trial, but denied
contact with *all persons*, then this administration is indeed
positioned to detain anyone perceived to be an Other, be it an
international resident or a domestic dissident.

"Terrorist"?

RACIAL PROFILING
"Since September 11, the INS and FBI have detained over 1,200
immigrants, mainly of Arab or South Asian (especially Pakistani)
origin. Most are accused only of minor immigration violations, such as
overstaying a visa. Despite Attorney General Ashcroft's assurances to
the contrary, many are being held without access to legal assistance or
proper care."
<a

"SEVIS is a national computer system operated by the INS.. Under SEVIS,
information on every international student is automatically provided to
the government via computer. Much more information on each student
collected and input. SEVIS works like the Interpol database. The
information is shared among federal agencies (and even other
countries!), and the student has no control over what is provided."
<a href="http://www.stopsevis.org">www.stopsevis.org</a>

<a

INS DETAINEES: WHERE ARE THEY NOW?
In the two months following the attacks, the Justice Department refused
to release specific information about detainees. Groups estimated that
more than 1,000 people had been detained, but it was unclear who they
were, why they had been detained, or whether any had been released.
<a

"The Department of Justice has argued that disclosing the names and
other information about post- September 11 detainees held on
immigration charges and opening their immigration hearings to the
public could compromise its terrorism-related investigations." Yet, "it
is difficult to square the Department of Justice's contention that
terrorist organizations are extremely sophisticated and could put
together bits and pieces of information from hundreds of hearings
around the country, with the argument that official disclosure would
alert such organizations to who has been detained. Sophisticated
terrorist groups likely already know through their own networks whether
any of their members or allies have been arrested."
<a

LEGGO MY FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT!
"[T]he DSEA would revoke key elements of the Freedom of Information Act
(FOIA), enacted to prevent government from keeping  secrets from the
public unless a legitimate security concern exists. Currently, FOIA
gives us the right to know if a missing person is in the custody of any
government agency. But under DSEA, anyone -- even U.S. citizens --
could be detained secretly in connection with any "terrorist"
investigation, a term lacking legal definition.
<a

KEEPING THE WORLD SAFE FOR HUMANITY
A NYTimes article reveals that the treatment of U.S. military prisoners
at Guantánamo Bay has yielded criticism: "without individual hearings
to determine the prisoners' status, without charges and trials, critics
see Guantánamo as a synonym for human rights violations. While there is
no indication of physical torture.. they still lack the basic legal
rights that many countries, including the United States, have agreed
are fundamental even to warriors."

Gen. Rick Baccus of the Army, who commands the detention center at
Guantánamo Bay, says, "While the public debates the technicalities of
how these people should be classified," he said, "we will continue to
follow the traditions of humane treatment." He added: "In other
countries, these detainees would not be heard from again."

Patriot II would make it possible indeed that these detainees would not
be heard from again. Even the directors of the U.S. military's most
aggressive jails acknowledge that Patriot II is contrary to USAmerican
concepts of justice.
<a

PRESUMED GUILTY: ANSER MEHMOOD
Anser Mehmood came to the U.S. from Pakistan in 1989. "On [September
11, 2001], he failed to make a scheduled delivery to Washington, DC.
Mehmood was taken into custody along with several thousand other men of
Middle Eastern and South Asian origin. Mehmood remains here in custody
although it turned out that it was his company that cancelled his
September 11th shipment to Washington when they learned of the Pentagon
bombing."
<a

The official charge on Anser Mehmood are an overstayed visa and and
altered security card (to secure employment). Uzma Mehmood, Anser's
wife, and their children have been forced to return to Pakistan, while
Anser remains in a NJ jail. "He is held without a bond on a very
specious affidavit put in by an FBI agent. And put in the special
housing unit otherwise known as 'The Hole'. It's solitary confinement
he's locked down 23 and a half hours a day. He's fed through a slot in
the door."

"I DIDN'T SPEAK OUT"
They came for the Communists, and I didn't speak out because I wasn't a
Communist.
Then they came for the Jews, and I didn't speak out because I wasn't a
Jew.
Then they came for the Trade Unionists, and I didn't speak out because
I wasn't a Trade Unionist.
Then they came for the Catholics, and I didn't speak out because I
wasn't a Catholic.
Then they came for me, and there was no one left to speak out for me.
-- Pastor Martin Niemoller

The climate is rapidly changing such that it is more and more likely
that a good number of U.S.-born citizens might be subject to
detainment. I'm sure I'm a good candidate, with the money I have given
and continue to give to organizations such as MoveOn.org and ZNet,
which are today considered treasonous at best.

How might they know who I've donated money to? Well for starters, a new
security program to be implemented by Delta Airlines later this month
will mean that when you book a flight to or from one of three
undisclosed airports, you will be subject to a credit check, an
investigation of your banking history, and a criminal background check.
The controls on how this information will be used has not been
adequately defined. This appears to be illegal. It is an egregious
invasion of privacy.
<a

SAUDI SUSPECTS OFF LIMITS

Maybe one reason the number of detainees is so high is, they're looking
for a needle in a haystack: an innocent on whom to pin a colossal,
heinous crime. from an interview with journalist Greg Palast:

"In the eight weeks since the attacks, over 1,000 suspects and
potential witnesses have been detained. Yet, just days after the
hijackers took off from Boston aiming for the Twin Towers, a special
charter flight out of the same airport whisked 11 members of Osama Bin
Laden's family off to Saudi Arabia. That did not concern the White
House.

"Their official line is that the Bin Ladens are above suspicion - apart
from Osama, the black sheep, who they say hijacked the family name.
That's fortunate for the Bush family and the Saudi royal household,
whose links with the Bin Ladens could otherwise prove embarrassing. But
Newsnight has obtained evidence that the FBI was on the trail of other
members of the Bin Laden family for links to terrorist organisations
before and after September 11th.

"This document is marked "Secret". Case ID - 199-Eye WF 213 589. 199 is
FBI code for case type. 9 would be murder. 65 would be espionage. 199
means national security. WF indicates Washington field office special
agents were investigating ABL - because of it's relationship with the
World Assembly of Muslim Youth, WAMY - a suspected terrorist
organisation. ABL is Abdullah Bin Laden, president and treasurer of
WAMY."
<a

More from Palast:

"FBI agents had wanted to check into two members of the Bin Laden
family, Abdullah and Omar, but were told to stay away by superiors --
until September 13, 2001. By then, Abdullah and Omar were long gone
from the United States.
<a

"The intelligence agencies had been told to "back off" from
investigations involving other members of the Bin Laden family, the
Saudi royals, and possible Saudi links to the acquisition of nuclear
weapons by Pakistan."
<a

[Editorial Note: I want to be clear that this reporting is not
anti-Saudi; it is of course offered to evidence the lack of integrity
and justice in the current U.S. administration]

WHY WAIT FOR PATRIOT II? DETAIN TODAY! Sadly, even without Patriot II,
immigrants are being detained on trivial charges, without recourse:

Rules on Detention Widened: FBI, Marshals Can Hold Foreigners: Attorney
General John D. Ashcroft has issued orders that allow FBI agents and
U.S. marshals to detain foreign nationals for alleged immigration
violations in cases where there is not enough evidence to hold them on
criminal charges, according to Justice Department officials and a copy
of the rules.
<a

Registration Program Problems Cited: Immigrants' Attorneys Kept From
Investigative Interviews: "The failure to provide clear and explicit
directions to local immigration officials is inexcusable given the
absolute right to legal counsel," said Lucas Guttentag, director of the
ACLU's Immigrants' Rights Project. He charged that the "foot-dragging"
could be explained only by a reluctance to dig into the matter before
the registration deadlines have passed.
<a



HOW MUCH BAD HISTORY CAN WE BEAR TO REPEAT? Let's not forget FDR's
passage of Executive Order 9066, which led to the internment of 110,000

TOY SURPRISE! A friend reminded me a few months ago that throughout our
fighting and disgust, we need to make a world worth saving. Pursue
beauty. Laughter. Celebrate our relationships. In that spirit, I

To Amy - 1st of all being arrested is supposed to be a shocking=20

you see all the prisoners? What did you expect? A room at the Hilton?=20

You're wrong <again>, the ILCS states that if a subject is=20

some of what is being reported here, on this list, raises ethical
issues that i'm not sure i have the wherewithal to address...

as i've posted here before, i'm against the current war... i'm also
against torture... but here again, and i don't wish to sound merely
provocative, but i can imagine a scenario in which i'd have fewer
reservations about torture---e.g., (really now) an imminent loss of
human life (to wit, if we don't learn so & so, 1000 lives *will* most
certainly be lost)... i.e., i'm not sure my principles extend to
massive loss of life...

of course this puts one (me anyway) in a potentially compromising
moral/ethical dilemma... but i'm not a purist when it comes to
ethics, and i think we ought to treat such difficulties
situationally... it's not that i'm condoning torture as such, but
it's just that i can see a greatest good argument (i.e., in terms of
numbers of human lives) being used to justify some form of torture...
and aside from argument, i know i just couldn't handle it emotionally
if i knew some bastard was holding onto information that would likely
save the life of a loved one...

some evil little side of me would also like to suggest that sleep
deprivation is not quite the same as physical battering... i don't
think i'm splitting hairs here---i don't have any problem with truth
serums, either---or at least, i don't think i do... i haven't been
convinced that fighting terrorism is going to happen entirely under
the kinds of criminal laws we have in place here in the u.s. at
present... and i detest ashcroft, far as i've been able to
determine... and i deplore what's happened to those two prisoners, as
reported by gabe... and i still think (i think) that international
law could have been applied to hunt down bin laden and al qaeda, and
that we might have avoided bombing afghanistan... but "intelligence,"
as the saying goes, is a dirty business, no point in being a
pollyanna about it, and i'm pretty certain most on this list would
not want to abolish our intelligence agencies outright---not right
now anyway (i hear a great pun here but i'll leave it alone)...

do i contradict myself?... judging by the emerson thread, most of you
know what comes next...

even as i say these things aloud (as it were)---and i'm only thinking
aloud here, folks---i feel as if i must resort to some kind of
cinematic experience/analogy... which is precisely what we mustn't
do, i know...

take phil m's intriguing riff on "embedded media"---viz., the media
"in bed with" our govt... well and good, & i wish i'd thought of
that!... but, but i don't think that's the whole story either...
e.g., many complaints were raised during gulf war 1 re lack of media
coverage... now you have more media coverage than you want, perhaps,
so i think we do better, in general, to talk specifically about the
quality of such coverage than to criticize its sheer abundance (i
continue to lament the personal interest stuff, as i feel this only
sensationalizes issues and events, fueling public and private
hostilities)... though here again, i think an argument could be made,
too, that the sheer abundance of coverage---and there has been a good
deal of coverage of protests too (however peeved i am at the
questions pitched to antiwar protesters by reporters)---is bound to
have a spectacle-effect... still, i'm not inured mself, not yet
anyway, to hearing about any loss of life... any loss of life... and
i get all welled-up when i hear about our soldiers dying, as i get
all welled-up hearing about iraqi citizens being maimed and killed by
our "precision" bombing...

i also believe that the presence of embedded media should (i say
should) mitigate against the standard sorts of war crimes occupying
powers tend to commit (e.g., rape)... and i wish we could have a
broader discussion of this aspect of the media presence---at some
point they cease being mere "observers," as we all know...

as wars drag on, we inevitably become inured to the images, as
spectators... so far this "war" ( in quotes now), for all of its
weaponized immensity, has felt more to me like a large-scale military
operation, or series of battles, b/c of the david-goliath aspect and
its likely brevity (i say likely)... of course i'm caught no doubt in
the past here, and my language probably needs an upgrade (which the
pentagon will be more than happy to provide, i know)... is a two-week
war a war?---or a massacre?... ok, so let's say it's not a massacre,
but if a massacre is not a war---?

in any case the effects on combatants, as i think we all know, are
far from clear... for that matter, i'll get behind the notion too
that pain is pain, and not merely a cultural effect (there's a book
on the latter too, btw)... if missiles were dropping on *my* head,
i'd probably say it's a war just based on the pain, fuck the lexical
distinctions...

i can imagine a situation too where i'd have fewer reservations re an
attack of iraq by (preferably u.n., but in any case some) military
forces---say, 87-88, when hussein was actively committing genocide...
i can imagine war, that is, as a woeful but necessary geopolitical
measure under specific circumstances... i was reamed on this list
some years ago by some---and in fact i understood where this reaming
was coming from, as i can only offer here, ever, my own conflicted
thoughts about such human and social desperations---for suggesting
that, u.n. or no u.n., the u.s. should send troops in to get rid of
milosevic---and at this point, based on everything i've read and seen
since, i feel somewhat redeemed (really)...

in fact, notwithstanding the current u.s. aggression and my
opposition to bush & co., i still think the u.s. is a better "regime"
than the one "we're" attacking... even in strictly military
terms----e.g., you won't see the u.s. using human shields anytime
soon... perhaps if i saw first-hand the current carnage we're
committing by bombing i'd change my mind, perhaps... but i don't
think bush & co., as insidious as they are, are on a par with hussein
(or milosevic), oil or no oil... not at this point, anyway, and i
hope we never get to a point beyond this point... and those who say
that the u.s. has an obligation to get rid of the tyrant we're
responsible for bringing to power---well hell, they've got a point,
don't they?... again, speaking argumentatively, much as we who are
opposed to the war have a point in saying the u.s. is jeopardizing
any longer term movement toward global peace...

there's a definitive bio out on khrushchev, btw, which indicates
that, along with much, much harm, he ultimately did some real good...
in short, that he changed as a human being over time, and that his
politics changed as a result (or maybe it was the other way
'round?)...

tell it to the thousands of thousands he helped to murder under
stalin, i know... i'm not a fan, you see, but it's an interesting
thought exercise at least to ponder the implications of khrushchev's
change of heart (let's say) for current global traumas... i mean,
since we're busy pondering and all...

i guess, deep down inside, i have a number of conflicting emotions
and intellectual quandaries and ethical convictions... i know i'm
angered e.g. by the treatment of u.s. pows at present... now, what
should i do with this anger?... politically---i don't mean
theoretically, i mean to refer to that finite social domain we call
politics---i know i have often to act in terms of ones and twos, not
sixes and sevens, however tentative my beliefs...

apologies for rambling on///

peace,

Everything is Illuminated
Innovative volume ponders romantic, erotic, and existential longing

by Phil Hall

Rachel Levitsky, founder and curator of the Belladona reading series at=20=

New York=92s recently lost Bluestockings Women=92s Bookstore, and author =
of=20
four acclaimed poetry chapbooks, has now published her first book=20
entitled Under the Sun.

Mixing language and observations that are equal parts challenging,=20
erotic, enigmatic, and playful, Under the Sun is a remarkable tumble=20
through an emotional funhouse where scares, passions and mirth divert=20
us from the ennui and disappointments of everyday life.

The poetry in Under the Sun surrounds the union and possible disunion=20
of two women dubbed Lady and Turtle. (Why these women were given such=20
names is never explicitly stated, and perhaps it is a reflection of the=20=

intellectual poverty of this critic that I initially envisioned Lady=20
and Turtle along the lines of Maggie Smith and the Japanese movie=20
monster Gamera. But never mind.) There is also a third woman on the=20
periphery named Urt, though her name and exact role in the story are=20
also kept mysterious. Perhaps the real joy of Under the Sun is that it=20=

carries the color of a half-told tale, where the reader needs to=20
tighten his thinking cap and piece together the missing pieces within=20
the drama.

Yet there is nothing elusive in many of the haunting yet serene images=20=

that Levitsky creates here. In =93Skies Are Gray,=94 she finds the =
perfect=20
mix of bitterness and rue when realizing time marched on without pity:=20=

=93Once upon a time when you flew./Once upon a time before you doubted=20=

your agility./Once upon a jigsaw puzzle that concealed the jigsaw path=20=

you were gliding upon./At which age your impulse was to protect that=20
which was smaller./When you believe you mattered to a thing if the=20
thing mattered to you./Whereupon your skin was intact, your genitals=20
open.=94

Sapphic interactivity rules in =93To Each Her Own,=94 where Levitsky=20
envisions two girls as one with the stanza: =93Four breasts meet/Eye to=20=

Eye/Not satisfied/With seeing=94=97and later in the same poem, the two =
main=20
characters reveal their romantic limits: =93Lady is spirited=20
and/Speedy/Turtle is tried by gluttony/Lady=92s gluttony/They speak=20
without words/Without understanding a single/One. Turtle presses down=20
on Lady./Lady watches her now.=94

Going deeper into erotica is the poem titled (appropriately enough)=20
=93Erotica,=94 begins with the amazingly frank lines: =93She tries to =
place=20
her hand up a tight ass. It is like putting a square peg in a round=20
hole.=94 Yet the poem quickly drifts out of joys of fisting and=20
hauntingly canvases the room where the passion is playing out. The poet=20=

finds and loses track of her playmate of the moment and scans the world=20=

around her, finding =93Convex divisions in the wall, on the floor, two=20=

and threes/Mates that don=92t match=94. This inventory of decor and=20
architecture culminates in an abrupt return to the reason for her=20
presence: =93Phone lines/Plane lines/Eye line/.=94

Within =93Indulgences: The Penitentiary [Desire!],=94 Levitsky brings =
Lady=20
and Urt together in a fascinating word-portrait: =93Positions by the=20
wall. Urt back against it back rubbing, scratching,/climbing. Lady=20
watching her, wanting to approach, wanting to be/ aside, astride,=20
wanting nothing behind or in front, but the body, maybe a bed then.=20
Inspiration, expiration. Some sort of belated,/bleating noise.=94

Threads of absurdist humor lace their way through many of the poems,=20
often as diverting asides. One wonderful turn of fancy finds Lady in=20
kinship with an unlikely literary icon: =93(Hansel and Gretel. =
Lady/sides=20
with the witch and/never wears sun block.)=94 There is also a prose poem=20=

where one of the women (it is not stated who) unleashes a hot stream of=20=

consciousness about her surly yet hunky man next door: =93The Neighbor =
is=20
always a problem. He asks questions but remains unmarked, unfixed. She=20=

marks him with her irritation. She makes him small. He is six feet=20
five. He acts on a soap. He is an electrician who works at night. He=20
stands in front of the door all day, smoking cigarettes. He drinks=20
non-alcoholic beer. He is buff. He works out everyday, even on Sunday.=94

Levitsky even trots out a pinch of vulgarity in =93Addictions and=20
Neighbors,=94 using simple scatological desires to define a pair of=20
results common at the end of a variety of experiences: =93i wanna be=20
fucked/i wanna be fucked up=94.

This slender volume, from the local independent publisher Futurepoem=20
Books, may run the risk of being pigeonholed in the sub-genres of=20
lesbian and/or feminist poetry. Yet Under the Sun is truly a universal=20=

celebration of pain, happiness, and the threat of being lost and alone.=20=

Levitsky=92s skill with the rapier-sharp edges of language to reach the=20=

heart make Under the Sun an illuminating poetic triumph.

Silliman comments on his blog--

"It really is the end of a United States that was conceived on the basis of some
very grand ideas not so far from here 227 years ago, replaced by a thug state
committed only to bullying the world into submission."


I can't help thinking of Davy Crockett's West, butchering Mexicans, burning
"Indians," 200+ years of institutionalized slavery, tar & feathers, lynchings .

It ain't all Walden Pond, is what I'm saying.

Does anyone really think we just recently took a sharp wrong turn?

Dear Frank,

What about the incarceration of Japanese-Americans in WWII?  I'm not saying that
the current state is right or OK--please don't mistake my intention-- I'm also
not opposing idealism, but what I perceive to be a wrong perspective on our
Union.

First "MacMobile Diner" Unit Lost South of Baghdad

(Gothic News, 03/23) In the first such loss in 21st Century Warfare,
McDonald=B9s announced the possible loss of one its franchise MacMobile units
after it crossed the border from Kuwait into Iraq. Assigned to an
unidentified Third Division Infantry Unit, the coach unit- called "The Mob"
by soldiers - lost contact with its satellite guidance system at some point
between lunch and dinner. Repeated calls from Franchise Headquarters to the
personal cell phone numbers of the three fry cooks and the five cash
register attendants still continue to prove futile. On a weekend in which
both United States and British forces have faced their first serious Iraqi
military opposition =AD including significant casualties =AD McDonald=B9s
Corporate officers were reluctant to draw attention to what may only be a
lost vehicle temporarily misguided and circling around the flat and desolat=
e
Iraqi landscape.=20
   "Something mostly likely went wrong with the Guidance System which has t=
o
also simultaneously use its lasers to guide about 300 other MacMobiles. And
that, as you know, is a large desert going up to there to Baghdad. The
MacMobile coach," the Company Officer went on to say, "is amply supplied
with meats, buns, freedom fries and soda. Though we are concerned for
employee safety, we are equally worried that the coach might not catch up
with their assigned Infantry unit by dinner. No, we are not concerned about
the loss of cash flow. The MacMobile Diners are very much apart of the war
effort. Reports already are in that the soldier=B9s option to buy
non-military, commercial rations has already proved a genuine morale raisin=
g
benefit to the troops."
   "What about in Post Iraq?"
   "Expanding the McDonald=B9s franchise into an Occupied Democratic Iraq is
certainly an humanitarian option and we have already received a go-ahead
signal from the Pentagon on that one. In fact the Pentagon has already
indicated that MacDonald's food services may expand to include both militar=
y
and civilian populations.  Right now, however, our attention is on finding
the lost unit consistent with our current main objective which is to make
sure 300 mobile Infantry support units do not get lost, stay out of the lin=
e
of fire, and help keep our troops happy under less than desirable
conditions."=20
   Though the Mobile Private Concession Initiative was considerably debated
when first introduced, the Pentagon successfully persuaded Congress that
historically private concessions - from brothels to alcohol as found in
descriptions in both the Old and New Testament - have historically  been
part and parcel of any travelling army. Wendy=B9s and Burger King - it's been
learned - are currently in competitive contention with MacDonalds in bids
for Mobile Diner contracts included in pre-emptive war plans on schedule fo=
r
both the Mid- and Far East.
   No news was yet available at dinnertime in Iraq as to whether or not the
MacDonald=B9s mobile unit has yet to be recovered.

Published on Sunday, March 23, 2003 by CommonDreams.org
        The Judicially-Selected Dictator's Pre-Emptive War
        by Ralph Nader

        As this is written, the campaign known as "shock and awe" has begun
over Iraq and the five million civilian inhabitants of Baghdad. Bombs indeed
shock, but why the word "awe"? This is Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld's
way of turning the Iraq bombardment against what he knows is a defenseless
country, run by a brutal dictator, into a metaphor for the rest of the
world. He wants the whole world in "awe" of the mighty military superpower
in preparation for the next move against another country in or outside the
"axis of evil".

        This is truly an extraordinary time in American history. A dozen men
and one woman are making very risky consequential decisions sealed off from
much muted dissent inside the Pentagon, the State Department, the CIA and
other agencies that have warned the President and his small band of
ideological cohorts to think more deeply before they leap. They are
launching our nation into winning a war which generates later battles that
may not be winnable - at least not without great economic and human costs to
our country.

        But let's back up a moment. Our founding fathers most emphatically
placed the warmaking power in the hands of Congress. They did not want some
arrogant or brooding successor to King George III to plunge the country into
war. They wanted a collegial body of many elected representatives to decide
openly (Article I, section 8).

        Last year, Congress, with leaders of both Parties, surrendered their
warmaking power to George W. Bush. This itself is unlawful. But
unfortunately, there is no judicial remedy for any citizen to challenge
assigning the warmaking power to the President. Senator Robert Byrd (D-West
Virginia) eloquently and repeatedly objected to this constitutional
abdication. The large majority of Congress just shrugged. They knew that
there was no punishment for this institutional crime.

        Mr. Bush, on the other hand, was only too eager to strip the
Congress of such authority, just as the Attorney General, both by action and
by demanding and receiving such crushers of civil liberties as the so-called
U.S. Patriot Act, was eager to diminish the role of the judiciary. Having
turned our federal system of separation of powers between three branches
into a one-branch hegemony, Mr. Bush proceeded to flout the U.N. Charter,
which the U.S. mostly drafted and signed on to in 1945.

        His preemptive war - the first in U.S. history - against a nation
that has neither attacked nor threatened our country cannot be construed as
self-defense and therefore violates international law. Washington would
certainly make exactly this point were another nation in the world to attack
a country it finds noxious.

        Then how do the arguments for going to war that Bush has made
endlessly on the mass media for a year, without a steady rebuttal by the
cowering Democratic Party, stand up? Bush's assertion that Iraq is
reconstituting its nuclear weapons program is based on evidence that
Congressman Henry Waxman called a "hoax." In a blistering letter to the
President on March 17th, Congressman Waxman all but called Bush's assertion
that Iraq was seeking uranium from Niger a lie, citing both the CIA and the
International Atomic Energy Agency as his authorities. Neither agency has
evidence of a rebuilding nuclear weapons program.

        President Bush has repeatedly tried to tie Iraq with Al-Qaeda. There
is no evidence to support these allegations. The two are mortal enemies -
one secular and the other fundamentalist. The CIA informed Congress that
confronting a U.S. overthrow attack, our former, supplied ally, Saddam
Hussein "probably would become much less constrained in adopting terrorist
actions." Even then, analysts have published articles casting doubt on the
efficacy of whatever mass destruction weapons he may have against a modern
air and missile attack followed by spread-out armored vehicles racing toward
a surrendering army.

        The UN inspectors found nothing in their forays inside Iraq before
Bush stopped their increasing penetration of that regime.

        On March 18th, the Washington Post, which avidly favors the war,
felt obliged to publish a story by two of its leading reporters titled,
"Bush Clings to Dubious Allegations About Iraq." The article questioned a
"number of allegations" that the Bush administration is making against Iraq
that "have been challenged - and in some cases disproved - by the United
Nations, European governments and even U.S. intelligence reports."

        Now that the short war has begun, it is hoped that there will be
minimum casualties on both sides. But after the U.S. military prevails, the
longer battles during occupation begin. They are fires, disease, hunger,
plunder and looting by desperate people and roving gangs, and bloodletting
between major religious and ethnic factions.

        U.S. intelligence agencies say the Iraq war will likely increase
global terrorism including inside this country. Respected retired military
generals and admirals, such as Marine General Anthony Zinni, believe it will
destabilize the Middle East region, undermine the war on terrorism and
distract from the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. "King George" is not
listening to them or to other prominent former leaders in the State
Department, Pentagon or the major intelligence agencies, including his
father's own National Security Advisor, Brent Scowcroft.

        This must be the only war in our history promoted by chickenhawks -
former belligerent draft dodgers - and opposed by so many of those inside
and outside of government who served in the armed forces.

        Still the Messianic militarist in the White House refuses to even
listen - either to opposing viewpoints held by tens of millions of Americans
or to viewpoints counseling other non-war ways to achieve the objectives in
Iraq. Indeed, he has refused to meet with any domestic antiwar delegation.
Groups representing veterans, labor, business, elected city officials,
women, clergy, physicians and academics with intelligence experience have
written requesting an audience (see www.essentialaction.org).

        Michael Kinsley is a sober, bright columnist who said that "in terms
of the power he now claims, George W. Bush is now the closest thing in a
long time to dictator of the world." One might also use a Canadian phrase -
an elected dictator. Correction - a judicially-selected dictator.

While my friend Matthias Regan was here in Buffalo this weekend to give a
poetry reading, his partner, Amy Partridge, was arrested and detained along
with approximately 800 other protesters in downtown Chicago. What follows
is her account, one of several posted to <http://chicago.indymedia.org>.

Subject: Chicago Arrests

The following is a message from Amy Partridge, who was arrested in
Chicago under the Patriot Act while exercising her constitutional
rights. Press accounts of these arrests last Thursday are inaccurate:
please help us get this message out.

Matthias Regan

Dear all,

I want to warn you all about what happened to hundreds of peaceful
protesters, myself included, at the rally and march on Thursday night
in downtown Chicago. Both the rally and march were entirely
peaceful. I saw not one instance of civil disobedience or aggro
behavior. Police escorted us on the March and onto Lake Shore Drive.
We were never asked to disperse or threatened with arrest. When
police prevented us from marching on Michigan Ave marchers moved on.
We were, however, surrounded by hundreds of police a few block later
and prevented from leaving. No one around me intended to or wanted
to be arrested. Everyone asked to be allowed to leave and disperse.
I have since heard this was not how the media reported it but more
than once the crowd chanted "let us go" and "we will disperse." The
police told individuals who asked that they could leave from some
other side of the crowd but in EVERY instance I witnessed this was
not the case and no one was allowed to leave, including a 17 year old
boy and his 14 year old sister. At first police rushed the crowd and
pulled out 10 people at a time. I and everyone around me was
arrested despite the fact that we were standing on the sidewalk (not
in the street) and that we asked again and again to be allowed to
leave since we had done nothing illegal. A cop grabbed me, put me in
cuffs, and told me I was being charged with mob action and that I
should be glad I was not in Iraq. I have since heard that people
were allowed to leave much later but we were told that everyone would
be arrested sooner or later.

Close to 300 (at least) women were held in custody for hours. I was
in custody for over 20 hours. Despite the fact that we were told
that we be released as soon as we were processed, I was held in a
jail cell from midnight until 4:00 pm the next day. During this time
I was not allowed a phone call, not read my rights, and my charge was
not explained to me. We were all told numerous times that we would
be released on I-Bonds, meaning once we were processed (mug shots
taken and finger prints sent to the federal registry) we could sign
ourselves out. A friend of mine came to get me at 8:00 am and was
told I would be released by noon. By 2:00 she was told I had been
"lost" and might not be "found" or released until Monday. When she
offered $100 cash at 4:00 (despite the fact that we had been told
explicitly numerous times that we did not require bail money) I was
"found" and released. Only because a cell phone had been smuggled
into my cell block was I able to contact this friend or to hear the
news that they were suddenly and inexplicably requiring $100 bail to
release us. The police allowed no one to call friends and family to
arrange this payment. We were all told that if we got arrested again
within 24 hours of signing our bond we would be charged with a
FELONY. Waiting parents and friends were told that if we SO MUCH AS
SHOWED UP AGAIN AT ANOTHER RALLY we would be charged with a felony.
This, of course, cannot be right. But this is the mood of Ashcroft's
America.

The average age of the arrestees as far as I could tell was between
17-25. No one I met had ever been arrested before or had had any
intention of being arrested for civil disobedience Thursday night.
At least 3 women that I met were tourists that had gotten trapped in
the crowd. This fact was explained both by the women themselves and
many of the protesters but they were treated no differently and as
far as I know held for the same amount of time as the rest of us.
While some the cops were fine, a number threatened us and many
ridiculed us. They treated us with disdain and disgust and booked us
as though we were terrorists under the new Patriot Act and not
peaceful protesters. It was a miserable and shocking experience.
This may have been the most egregious response and it may be that no
other peaceful protesters will be trapped and arrested as we were.
But I recommend if you intend to go to any future protests that you
make sure you have a number of a lawyer or the ACLU memorized. I
would also suggest that you let someone know you are going and that
if you do not call them upon your return that they should check to
see if you have been arrested. Those of us that had it worst and were
held the longest did not have anyone waiting for us and demanding our
release.

All the best,

Dear All,

I am sending this as a follow-up message. I posted an account of my
experience being arrested on www.chicago.indymedia.org along with
many other of the arrestees. One of the arresting officers replied
to my posting and to others who had responded to it and I include his
reply below. The tone of this email was the tone of the entire
arresting process. I did and do feel terrorized but I refuse to let
this just happen. Please feel free to send on my original account
and this cop's (who does not state his name but goes by the moniker
"Patriot") response to any one who might be interested. Thank you.

You all can't be this dumb!!

         comment#22672

To Amy - 1st of all being arrested is supposed to be a shocking
experiance. You should be ashamed and humiliated by your actions that
put you in this situtation. Complaining about overcrowded cells? Did
you see all the prisoners? What did you expect? A room at the Hilton?
Whoever told you would be released once your prints cleared was
correct. The problem was all you idiots getting arrested clogged the
system. The majority of you were NOT processed by midnight. By 0630
there were still 70 females left to picture and print. Not to mention
the 300+ males, all hitting the computers at once, slows it all
down. Sorry you didn't enjoy your stay at Chez Grand Central.

Peaceful protesters? Take a look at the pics from this site alone!
Angry, screaming faces, traffic at a standstill, I only hope that
noone died trying to get to Northwestern or St. Joe's Hospital and
had to re-route because of your groups actions. Won't that be a nice
lawsuit?

You're wrong <again>, the ILCS states that if a subject is
re-arrested for ANY offense prior to the scheduled court date that
they were bonded out for they will be charged for Violation of Bail
Bond, and held until their court date. Read your law. Ah no, silly
me, you'd rather whine!

Class action suit for what? You broke the law, you were arrested.
Simple math, even you should be able to figure it out. Every arrestee
was handled within the law, just because we treated you like the
assholes you were doesn't merit a lawsuit. You are all angry,
embarrassed and humiliated. You should be.

To Tamera:
I had the pleasure of housing you in the "Whore Block". It's not a
nice place, it isn't meant to be. But what did you think jail was
going to be? Did you expect us to tuck you in your jammies with a
pillow and blankie and a mint under your pillow? The jail wasn't
re-decorated for your arrival, it's like that everyday. Just be
greatful we had it cleaned prior to your arrival.

To Luisiana:
Understand this. There are no physians on staff in the lockups.
Medication is not allowed to be dispensed. You claim to have became
ill, you were taken to a medical facility, in handcuffs. You were a
prisoner, any prisoner not secured in a cell must be handcuffed.

To all of you whining tree-hugging Saddam loving pigs: Before you get
involved in something that could land you in jail, know your law. The
comments made here only show your ignorance. Someone commented about
being read their rights <it's Miranda rights by the way>,none of you
were "read" your rights because you were not being questioned about a
crime. Stop thinking this is TV. Life is dramatic enough. Know what
you're talking about before spouting off.

No, maybe not. But look what happened in 1777 to anyone who did not

Those of you who voted for Nader because you couldn't see any differences
bertween the political parties might want to ask yourselves if you are
complicit in the electing of the madmen who now control our destinies, and
who have incidentally trampled on our rights as citizens and on as many
environmental protections as they could get away with.

It seems to me that given our winner-take-all elections a multi-party
system is virtually impossible in the US. To change the parties--to make
them more representative of one's opinions--one has to work through the
primaries. The most conservative and determined Republicans did this and
took over the party, but only because most rank-and-filers don't vote in
the primaries. A left-wing, or at least considerably more left-wing,
Democratic party is possible--all it would take is a few election  cycles
in which the furthest left candidate is nominated. Grass-roots organizing,
and getting folks to the polls for the primaries.

Which would still leave us with the insoluble problem of an archaic
constitution, which gives a senatorial voter in Wyoming 68 times as much
power as a senatorial voter in California.

Though I don't read much of what's on the list,
to my knowledge no one has commented in any detail about
this poem which was posted to this list (or at least "the link" was)

Anyway, rereading it again, I just wanted to say I am really getting into
(or "off on")
the "leap" (or "potentially liberating knot")
that occurs at the third-to-last stanza....

"Not dumped on by the world
They won't let you into,
Not forgotten by all
The ones who did it to you"

How Creeley is able to get there, in part due to pronouns,
from where the poem seemed to be before that....

Did anybody else have any feelings about that?

Chris

I wish I'd seen the link to this poem when it first appeared on the list.
Does anyone out there know where I can find it?

Several people have written to the Buffalo poetics list to thank the listee=
s
for providing so much valuable information and useful debate on the war
against Iraq and the Bush administration policies on civil rights. I
couldn=B9t agree more. When you compare the poetics list and what is availabl=
e
online to mainstream media coverage it is clear that the information gap is
widening every moment. A demonstration in Chicago on Thursday led to the
arrest of 800. These were not provoked or planned arrests. Another link
provided on the list reported on a demonstration in Greece numbering in the
hundreds of thousands. These were hardly touched on in mass media reporting=
.
Michael Moore's courageous statement at the Academy Awards ceremonies last
night may well be prophetic. At one point, a Mexican show business
professional -worked on =B3Frida=B2- made an anti-war statement and I decided t=
o
write to Heriberto Yepez (who teaches philosophy in Tijuana, Mexico and who
is a poet who recently visited here and read recently in Lytle Shaw's
"Drawing Center" poetry series) about this. When Michael Moore won the Osca=
r
for =B3Bowling for Columbine=B2 (a movie I greatly admired) and made a rousing
speech against the war and Bush=B9s illegal coup I wrote to Heriberto again. =
I
didn=B9t at all expect the answer I received but it made me think. I wrote fo=
r
his permission to publish it on -fait accompli-
(http://nickpiombino.blogspot.com/) and on the poetics list.

I am writing a blog on the Oscars/Frida/anti-war involvement and I just rea=
d
your email, and I was also thinking of you when was seeing that-"you"
meaning American poets. You need to do something. I don't know what but thi=
s
is a moment when the intelligent people of America need to do something
radical to stop the meaning "America" has now to many many people on the
world. Stop this government. Nick I think your community (LangPoe, Post-s,
NY, etc) needs to do something visible against this goverment you have.
Those protests agains the war in NY are great. That's helping a lot the way
the outside world, the media, etc, is seeing what America really is.

I think it was Adorno who said what a nation (people/culture) is not what
the norm is_does but what opposes that. So I know the Americans are always
intelligent. The sleepwalkers need to understand they are not being
American, they are damaging not only countries like Iraq and Mexico but als=
o
America itself. Being a Mexican or being an American or being a Iraqi needs
to be being-totally-intelligent.

As a reader of contemporary experimental writing and I self-made-expert on
wanting to understand what "America" really means, I need to tell you this
is the moment experimental writing needs to be socially relevant to your
culture. This post 9-11 world is a new Vietnam situation in which writers
need to act. In Mexico we had that wake up moment in 1994, with the NAFTA
and with the zapatista movement. Even though still we need to wake up even
more, because too many Mexican writers and artists are so fucking boring an=
d
conservative.

What would an experimental writer from the best avant gards do in times lik=
e
this? The Mexican and the American writers and every writer needs to do
something, is not enough to be so complex

=97 you're complex, get over that fact, go beyond=97

now you have to be so much more than that. Talk with the other langpo peopl=
e
and beyond them, this is the historical moment when we are going to know if
the LangPo and beyond scenes are a real avant garde or just
literature-as-usual.

You're a person who I respect a lot and I think the American writers can
find a way to do something versus the war=97go to the Media or something, put
the experimental writing history into real political public debate.

Saludos y muchos abrazos,

Nick and by proxy Heriberto

In these polarizing and paralyzing times one of the vaues of the list for me
has been it's seeming ability to tolerate ambiguity which is of course a
quality of poetry that matters.  As an example of this I would give reaction
to the flag symbol after 9-11 and tolerance of anti-USCentric thinking in
that both sides of these debates must enter into formation of a new us (both
lower and uppercase).

As I sit here ambiguously in the redneck heartland surrounded by SUV-filled
interstates connected the MALLofamericas and bombarded by news headlines
paid for by Pillsbury (used as an example here) I realize my human contact
on my walking meanders to day consisted of an illegal who had worked for
Pilsbury, a 76-year old Black vet of Korea, a Kurd immigrant shopkeeper, and
my granddaughter.  Akbar lived near here.  Al Gore taught a course on
community organization here today on community organization but did not
teach it to the community but to children of those with the economic and
test-taking wherewithall to rise out of the community.

Now I relaize I am meandering in my mind but I think this tolerance of
ambiguity is the ground out of which a new direction poetically as well as
politically might rise.

"windscreen, by Jupiter! Who is he?" asked Drusus.
There were middle of these time sharing, omitting the
watchman; and afterwhile they assembled in a group near the
fire, some sitting, some fields prone. As they went
bareheaded habitually, their hair breathless out in thick,
dilettante, sunburnt shocks; their purgatory optimism their
throats, and Jerod in mats down the breast; mantles of the
skin of kids and lambs, with the fleece on, wrapped them

WHY WE INVADE ENGLAND: ACTS, EDICTS AND DECLARATIONS, 1607-1691
Texts by James I, Oliver Cromwell, Charles II, William III (Prince of
Orange),
Mary II, British Parliament

Curator: Aaron Levy

Reception: Wednesday March 26, 2003; 6:30 pm - 8:00 pm
Exhibition Duration: March 26, 2003 to May 26, 2003

Exhibition and opening reception is free to the public.

The exhibition "Why We Invade England: Acts, Edicts and Declarations,
1607-1691" features a timely selection of publications from the Stuart
Dynasty by James I, Oliver Cromwell, Charles II, William III (Prince of
Orange), Mary II, and the British Parliament, evidencing the fragility
of power as amassed and imposed through law. The Stuart dynasty reigned
in England and Scotland from 1603 to 1714, a period which saw a
flourishing Court culture but also much upheaval and instability through
plague, fire and war, intense religious debate and radical politics.
Items are on loan from the Quinn Collection, North Salem, NY.

We want sweetness in our houses, and
to sleep, despite the bellow of these
machines embedded in our most
sensitive rooms, whose sheets

flap emblazoned with the lead
stare of invasion. It's over there,
they tell me, blowing up and
simmering down, until even air

coats with corpses, and now this dance
of who owns what begins, falling down
when we insulate our living rooms against
the savor of burned skin, the sound

in every tone of conquest: we want their lives
to crumple, streak; we want to burn their skies.

From Gabe Gudding's message, and others, I assume this is an appropriate and
timely posting re: the death of Rachel Corrie.

"John Bradley, and William Witherup, co-editors of the anti-Iraq war
anthology in progress, HOW MANY MILES TO BABYLON, invite all poets to
submit an elegy to Rachel Corrie, the courageous young woman from
Evergreen State College in Olympia, Washington who stood up to an armed
Israeli bulldozer in Rafah, Palestine, the West Bank, on Sunday, 16
March, 2003.  If you want more information, contact Bill
Witherup,co-editor, at moolmool27@msn.com.  We're still accepting poems
on the war on Iraq.  Send poems to John Bradley, 560 Normal Rd., DeKalb,
IL 60115.  Enclose an SASE.  New deadline: April 30, 2003."

MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

I'm gettin into as of late, a bit o the ole research about the LAST POETS and have found frighteningly little documentation of readings, events, even critical stuff. Anyone have anything to offer? On either or any of the varying recombinations of people who at any time claimed that name, I'm not stuck on any allegiance to the REAL last poets or even the first last poets, just pieces of the members who decided to riff on the coattails of the name/politics (as the name seems to also be the politics), anything?

ALSO!! just a quick plug for my NYC summer sublet! I have a nice big 1-bedroom going for the low low price of 900/month (mid-May thru Aug)!, a bit out of the heart of manhattan but really a great neighborhood (Inwood/Riverdale) - it's fer a good cause...i'm organic a-farming this summer and can't afford to unless i can have a few months off rent payments...

>
> In Gulf War I, Bush I tried out a self-defense story: Saddam was

> Then he found a winning story, a rescue story -- The Rape of Kuwait.

must write quickly, but with time of the essence and none to lose i'd
like to add quickly that heriberto is quite right in his call and poets
of whatever stripe might respond best by first imagining outside of
"poet" and its assumed responsibilities (not sure what those are
exactly, but quickly): "go to the media or something," and yes that's a
difficult task, and which media? and how? -- there are university cable
channels, for example, and UCSD comm. dept. (just one of my
affiliations) for one is currently trying to design/deliver programming
to then tape and deliver to classrooms, etc. -- but generally, "to be so
much more than that" and to "put the experimental writing history into
real political public debate" are grand notions, idealized wasy of i
think saying that finding ways to maneuver and manifest, as poet, as
poetry, is now more important, perhaps has been for a while, than being
a poet and finding a way to make poetics matter -- what's been going
here on poetics as Nick says is great and the leads *out* to alternative
sources has been amazing -- i'm hopeful that those here are probably
*doing* what heriberto calls for and should continue in that
multilateral direction of operating channels of communication, poet-wise
or otherwise, as much as possible=20

Several people have written to the Buffalo poetics list to thank the
listees for providing so much valuable information and useful debate on
the war against Iraq and the Bush administration policies on civil
rights. I couldn=B9t agree more. When you compare the poetics list and
what is available online to mainstream media coverage it is clear that
the information gap is widening every moment. A demonstration in Chicago
on Thursday led to the arrest of 800. These were not provoked or planned
arrests. Another link provided on the list reported on a demonstration
in Greece numbering in the hundreds of thousands. These were hardly
touched on in mass media reporting. Michael Moore's courageous statement
at the Academy Awards ceremonies last night may well be prophetic. At
one point, a Mexican show business professional -worked on =B3Frida=B2- =
made
an anti-war statement and I decided to write to Heriberto Yepez (who
teaches philosophy in Tijuana, Mexico and who is a poet who recently
visited here and read recently in Lytle Shaw's "Drawing Center" poetry
series) about this. When Michael Moore won the Oscar for =B3Bowling for
Columbine=B2 (a movie I greatly admired) and made a rousing speech =
against
the war and Bush=B9s illegal coup I wrote to Heriberto again. I didn=B9t =
at
all expect the answer I received but it made me think. I wrote for his
permission to publish it on -fait accompli-
(http://nickpiombino.blogspot.com/) and on the poetics list.

I am writing a blog on the Oscars/Frida/anti-war involvement and I just
read your email, and I was also thinking of you when was seeing
that-"you" meaning American poets. You need to do something. I don't
know what but this is a moment when the intelligent people of America
need to do something radical to stop the meaning "America" has now to
many many people on the world. Stop this government. Nick I think your
community (LangPoe, Post-s, NY, etc) needs to do something visible
against this goverment you have. Those protests agains the war in NY are
great. That's helping a lot the way the outside world, the media, etc,
is seeing what America really is.

I think it was Adorno who said what a nation (people/culture) is not
what the norm is_does but what opposes that. So I know the Americans are
always intelligent. The sleepwalkers need to understand they are not
being American, they are damaging not only countries like Iraq and
Mexico but also America itself. Being a Mexican or being an American or
being a Iraqi needs to be being-totally-intelligent.

As a reader of contemporary experimental writing and I self-made-expert
on wanting to understand what "America" really means, I need to tell you
this is the moment experimental writing needs to be socially relevant to
your culture. This post 9-11 world is a new Vietnam situation in which
writers need to act. In Mexico we had that wake up moment in 1994, with
the NAFTA and with the zapatista movement. Even though still we need to
wake up even more, because too many Mexican writers and artists are so
fucking boring and conservative.

What would an experimental writer from the best avant gards do in times
like this? The Mexican and the American writers and every writer needs
to do something, is not enough to be so complex

=97 you're complex, get over that fact, go beyond=97

now you have to be so much more than that. Talk with the other langpo
people and beyond them, this is the historical moment when we are going
to know if the LangPo and beyond scenes are a real avant garde or just
literature-as-usual.

You're a person who I respect a lot and I think the American writers can
find a way to do something versus the war=97go to the Media or =
something,
put the experimental writing history into real political public debate.

Folks,

Joe Amato's point about the possibility that embedded media will have an
ameliorating impact on the conduct of war (aka trying to limit atrocities) may
be true, but it is also perhaps overstated, since these journalists will not
be allowed free access by any means (and, reports from alt media sources
suggest the usual intimidations by the Pentagon are in full force).  And yet,
it is clear that the Pentagon is conducting the war in such a way (to its
credit, but this is only *so far*) so as to limit civilian casualties.
Whether that is due to the alternative media (al-Jazeera tv, internet, etc.)
is difficult to ascertain, but certainly it plays a role.  This is a crucial
difference from the previous Gulf War, in which U.S./Allied forces attacked
civilian infrastructure with impunity (never mind what they're saying
now--they attacked electrical grids, water filtration plants, the works--which
led to a horrific humanitarian crisis due to water-borne disease).

Rachal,
   I know there's a book entitled "On a Mission: Selected Poems and a History of
the Last Poets" by Aboidun Oyewole. Here is a link of Last Poets links that I
have found.

http://www.fsbassociates.com/books/poets.htm

I haven't looked up anything the Last Poets in a while, so I don't know that
much about the more obscure or recent poets involved in the movement.

Good luck! I hope this helps.

News Media Let White House Approve and Change Quotes in Articles

following letter from a Washington Post reporter. It was sent to Poynter
Online, a news and opinion Website about the media for the media.

3/13/2003 2:41:44 PM

Posted By: Jim Romenesko From JONATHAN WEISMAN, Economics Writer,
Washington Post:In the wake of Seymour Hersh's open statements about the
way the White House treats the press, I feel compelled to relate a personal
story that illustrates how both the White House and the press have allowed
manipulation of the printed word in Washington to get out of hand. This is
a bit of a confession as well as an appeal to the White House and my fellow
reporters to rethink the way journalism is practiced these days.Recently, I
was working on a profile of the now-departed chairman of the White House
Council of Economic Advisers, R. Glenn Hubbard. I dutifully went through
the White House press office to talk to an administration economist about
Hubbard's tenure, and a press office aide helpfully got me in touch with
just the person I wanted. The catch was this: The interview would be off
the record. Any quotes I wanted to put into the newspaper would have to be
e-mailed to the press office. If approved, the quotation could be
attributed to a White House official. (This has become fairly standard
practice.)Since the profile focused on Hubbard's efforts to translate
relatively arcane macroeconomic theory into public policy, the quote I
wanted referenced the president's effort to end the double taxation of
dividends: "This is probably the most academic proposal ever to come out of
an administration." The press office said it was fine, but the official
wanted a little change. Instead, the quote was to read, "This is probably
the purest, most far reaching economic proposal ever to come out of an
administration." I protested that the point of the quote was the word
"academic," so the quote was again amended to state, "This is probably the
purest, most academic, most far reaching economic proposal ever to come out
of an administration."What appeared in the Washington Post was, "This is
probably the purest, most academic ... economic proposal ever to come out
of an administration." What followed was an angry denunciation by the White
House press official, telling me I had broken my word and violated
journalistic ethics.I had, of course, violated journalistic ethics, by
placing into quotation marks a phrase that was never uttered by the source,
ellipses or no ellipses. I had also played ball with the White House using
rules that neither I nor any other reporter should be assenting to. I think
it is time for all of us to reconsider the way we cover the White House. If
administration officials want to speak off the record, they are off the
record. If they are on background as an administration official, I suppose
that's the best we can expect. But the notion that reporters are routinely
submitting quotations for approval, and allowing those quotes to be
manipulated to get that approval, strikes me as a step beyond business as
usual.

An LP by Melvin Van Peebles &, of course, several by Gil Scott Heron, =
contemporaneous to early Last Poets LP's, open this range of poetry. I =
vividly recall Gwendolyn Brooks insisting that we pay close attention to =
Van Peeble's poem/LP cut "Lily Do the Zampougi Every Time I Pull Her =
Coattails." I can come up with the LP title if you're in need of this =

thanx phil, and i take anastasios' point too... the media
narrativizing of this war is certainly (and inexorably) moralizing
(to borrow from hayden white many years ago now), and in any case i
find the more gung-ho aspects regrettable in the extreme... one
general this morning at a press briefing gave me pause:  "the media
is reality"... no doubt if you're "embedded" with the troops it's
difficult too not to partake of the general machismo... (even more
innocent slips are contextualized in unhelpful ways:  e.g., judy
woodruff accidentally saying, wrt the families of pows, something
like "it must be torture to know..." and then a few moments later, to
her credit, realizing the blunder and correcting herself on camera)...

but here you go:  yesterday ms-nbc did a focus group thing, where
they interviewed approx. 10 of what looked to be (to my biased
western eye), by and large, middle-class egyptians... they were asked
what they thought of the war, and to a person explained (in
english!), quite cogently i thought, how and why they felt the u.s.
was making a huge mistake (for all of the reasons discussed
hereabouts)... one person said something i couldn't agree with---to
wit, 'that if the iraquis want to rid themselves of hussein, that's
up to them'---but (get this) when the interviewer later tried to
argue, with the moderator, that all the u.s. needed to do evidently
was better "educate" the arab world, another reporter (wish i could
recall her name) countered by saying that this wasn't a matter of
"educating" other countries, that the u.s. would not easily be able
to pr their way out of this...

on ms-nbc, again, and i think this was around 4:30 est... granted,
too much of the reportage---and the framing for same (e.g., before
commercial interruption)---is inexorably u.s.-govt.-centered,
sensationalistic... it would be difficult of course to imagine the
news agencies of this country taking a stand AGAINST our troops
(right?)... but it would be nice if there were more reportage of
iraqi casualties (one could argue at this point, *any* reportage of
same)...

i liked what michael moore said/did btw at the oscars, yet was struck
by chris matthews referring to moore (yesterday, the first "hardball"
since the war started) as not yet "housebroken" (ugh, what a thing to
say), and going on to praise adrian brody's more moderate plea for
peace (which i liked too, for that matter)... perhaps a lesson here
in the reception of different kinds of critiques---personally, i'm
all for both, but perhaps a lesson here nonetheless...

best,

joe

The Van Peebles piece was from his show titled, I think I remember, Ain't
Supposed to Die a Natural Death -- There was, believe it or not, a video
production of this that aired on public TV --

There was a Madhabuti LP with music -- can't recall the title right off --
Don't think it's currently available on CD -- probably can be found in the
used music market

Most of the Scott Heron is back in circulation, as are his two novels!

the Motown Baraka has never been reissued that I am aware --

as is to be expected, the more adventurous poetry of the era remains hard
to come by -- there were, for instance, 2 LPs that included N.H.
Pritchard!  ever heard "ASWELAY"?

Viz-Ops Shifts Media Point of View in Iraq

(Gothic News Service, 03/25) Viz-Ops =AD the White House/Pentagon organizatio=
n
in Iraq responsible for still photography and cinematic site management -
has withdrawn its Cecil B. De Mille group from Media control of ground
operations. The De Mille group  - with an expertise in ancient Biblical and
desert landscapes - was responsible for training and embedding network and
cable film crews to shoot from inside Bradley tanks as they rolled into
Iraq.
   In off-the-record remarks, Jay Cagney, Viz-Ops new Director, revealed
that the DeMille group achieved exactly what Command wanted in the visual
capture of sublime and enduring patriotic views of hundreds of American
tanks cruising in formation across the desert towards Baghdad =AD while no
doubt simultaneously terrifying possible enemy resistance. These lead
caravan images paired spectacularly with T.V. images of the golden clouds
that lifted and hung radiantly over Baghdad during the first Air Force
strikes on the City. Like a great symphony, it was a first class overture
and feed to networks around the world."
   Replacing the DeMille Group is B-Movie Enterprises (B-ME), a Culver City=
,
California Group noted for its expertise in re-mixing fresh 35MM Prints of
Thirties classics with remakes that already include Angels with Dirty Faces=
,
Little Caesar, The Public Enemy and Dead End -  titles that Viz-Ops suggest=
s
prophesy conflict conditions and prospects in cities through out Iraq.
   "As troops now face house-to-house urban warfare," Cagney continued,
"Viz-Ops has asked B-ME to provide Network and Cable film crews with review
training in panning roof jumps, interior black and white shots, up-close
weapon manipulation, and, most important, the skills required to portray
urban combat personnel with a sophisticated, non-stressed appearance of
accomplishing immediate objectives while keeping an overall grasp of their
difficult mission. Viz-Ops is also studying the Bruce Lee=B9s Kung Fu film
techniques as well as the urban feel of Spike Lee=B9s works =AD though it is
already understood approaches of both these filmmakers may present problems
for Fox Network=B9s viewers at the white male right and center."
   When asked about the finale of the war, particularly images of surrender
and liberation, Cagney said, "That will require another kind of expertise
and represents the huge challenge to balance the arrest of combatants with
Iraqi joy at liberation from the grips of Saddam. We obviously have to make
the Iraqi surrender as cordial as possible.  Soldiers will have to do a
quick turn around from fight-mode to a stance of generous care including
medical and nutrition support. Viz-Ops is currently studying community
scenes in Broadway Musicals =AD everything from West Side Story to Chorus
Line. The War Finale and it=B9s opening to U.S Occupation has to be uplifting=
,
hopeful and optimistic for everyone."
   The Pentagon refused to characterize Cagney=B9s off-the-record remarks
other than to say, "It would be totally erroneous to have Viz-Ops=B9 work
interpreted in a cynical manner. These are the lives of young American men
and women soldiers who are at war with a ruthless dictator bent on creating
harm and terror across the world. Media Images of this conflict and the
portrayal of our peaceful objectives remain at the heart of our business."

I remember a big show of the (new) Last Poets at MIT about five or six years
ago. I think it may have been part of some sort of conference, although I'm
not sure--but there was a rather lengthy introduction/talk about them, so
there might be someone at MIT worth hunting down...

Aaron, of course- the Japanese-American internment. Still, the USA's never been an ocean-to-ocean police state for all its citizens. This is our near present & our dark future. If it doesn't bother you because it's just one more blip on the injustice screen...so be it.

replying off-list as I've hit my 2 post quota for the day --

Norman H. Pritchard was one of the more "experimental" members of the
Umbra group of poets in the 60s -- I talk about him a bit in my book
BLACK CHANT -- He had a book from NYU press and another from Doubleday
(back during that brief moment when mainstream presses pub'd poets like
Clark Coolidge, Rosmarie Waldrop, Kathleen Fraser & Pritchard!) -- was
given to various forms of concrete etc -- also was on the cover of
LIBERATOR magazine -- He reads on 2 LPs from the era; one called
DESTINATIONS and another called NEW JAZZ POETS -- His "ASWELAY" gets a
name drop in the midst of Ishmael Reed's MUMBO JUMBO, as Ish was also
associated with UMBRA --

anyway, in later years he seemed to disappear from the poetry scene,
and I'm told he died about 3 years back -- I really wish somebody had
gotten around to interviewing him -- and I hope one day to find out if
he left any work behind,,,,, but first I have to find out where the
hell he was -----

replying off-list as I've hit my 2 post quota for the day --

Norman H. Pritchard was one of the more "experimental" members of the
Umbra group of poets in the 60s -- I talk about him a bit in my book
BLACK CHANT -- He had a book from NYU press and another from Doubleday
(back during that brief moment when mainstream presses pub'd poets like
Clark Coolidge, Rosmarie Waldrop, Kathleen Fraser & Pritchard!) -- was
given to various forms of concrete etc -- also was on the cover of
LIBERATOR magazine -- He reads on 2 LPs from the era; one called
DESTINATIONS and another called NEW JAZZ POETS -- His "ASWELAY" gets a
name drop in the midst of Ishmael Reed's MUMBO JUMBO, as Ish was also
associated with UMBRA --

anyway, in later years he seemed to disappear from the poetry scene,
and I'm told he died about 3 years back -- I really wish somebody had
gotten around to interviewing him -- and I hope one day to find out if
he left any work behind,,,,, but first I have to find out where the
hell he was -----

We need to pay attention to names.

By naming their assault "Shock and Awe," Bush and his extremist cohorts can
promote the sacred text for their scheme to subjugate the Middle East to
their Apocalypse Zion Empire.  Let us pray.

Meanwhile, the media is comfortably "embedded" with the military, and we
can now watch Ted Koppel dart through scripted bloodshed with the proper
erotic aplomb.  Let us masturbate.

The cable news networks do not label the assault somewhat neutrally as "The
U.S.-Iraqi War." Instead, they trumpet the Pentagon code, "Operation Iraqi
Freedom," which gives the war the quality of a brand name.  Indeed, many
Americans are aware that we are being sold.  Let us keep all our receipts.

On the eve of the war, Prime Minister Blair managed to convince President
Bush that the moment had come for him to promote "The Roadmap" for
Israeli-Palestinian peace.  The plan was designed to have the great powers
(Europe, Russia, the US) shove a compromise down the throats of the two
parties along lines familiar to all: two states, withdrawal of settlements,
no mass repatriation of refugees.  The idea was to gag Israeli and
Palestinian gullets equally and thus to effect peace.  Blair wanted "The
Roadmap" to show Europe and the rest of the world that he has the
wherewithal to nudge the Emperor to pay attention to the real source of
conflict.  But when Bush heralded his version of the "Roadmap" at his press
conference, it was filled with loopholes, with allowances for Israel to
reject some components and to re-interpret others.  In the end, this was
much like Bush telling Sharon to withdraw from his attacks on the West
Bank: it meant just the opposite.  Bush's "Roadmap" amounted to a
"Blueprint" for Israel to build more settlements and then to erect walls
around them.  Let us jump out of the way of lurching Hummers.

"Freedom" has been redefined as anything not French.  Let us deconstruct
the Statue of Liberty.

"Apache" is what settlers call dreams after they kill the dreamers then eat
them to take on their powers.  Perhaps years from now a type of helicopter
will be named "Iraqi."  Let us wake up.

"Geneva Conventions" are good rules for them; for us they are fun parties
on tropical islands.  Let us cry for mercy.

"Support our troops," as in "No matter what you think about the war, we
need to support our troops," actually means "I can't believe this war is a
fraud and my son/daughter/father/mother is going to get killed for
Halliburton" or "Keep your mouth shut."  Let us tell shit from Shinola.

Mime-Version: 1.0

I wrote a piece on N.H. Pritchard for Overlooked, a anthology of
"overlooked" poems now in production. It will accompany a couple of
Pritchard's poems that I selected. But since his work has come up on the
list now, I thought I would send out an excerpt from my prefatory essay.

******

I found N. H. (Norman) Pritchard's The Matrix: Poems 1960-1970 at the Ark,
a used book store on the Upper West Side of Manhattan just a few years ago.
It is an elegant clothbound book with a large photo of Pritchard, featuring
his elegant handlebar moustache  he looks a bit like a soulful Salvador
Dali  staring, eerily, from the front cover (or is it from the great
beyond?). The book was published by Doubleday in 1970 but the only
sustained references I know to Pritchard's work are A. L. Nielsen's
immensely useful discussion in his 1997 Black Chant: Languages of
African-American Postmodernism and a much earlier essay by Lorenzo Thomas,
"The Shadow World: New York's Umbra Workshop & Origins of the Black Arts
Movement," published in Callaloo in 1978. (Nielsen mentions a 1992 essay by
Kevin Young, "Signs of Repression: N. H. Pritchard's The Matrix.")

The Matrix is a strikingly designed volume, composed of 71 poems in three
parts, mostly visual or "concrete" poems, which are at the same time
"sound" poems. It is one of the most interesting works of its kind from
this period of American poetry. Nielsen mentions the connection to scat, a
jazz vocalist's style of intoning "vocables" (vocal sounds not immediately
processed as words), while Thomas notes the connection with the "vocal
styles and tones" of African languages. Pritchard hops, skips, and jumps
with his syncopated words, creating spaces inside words in a way that makes
one word many. It's a rhythmic concatenation that relies on multiplicity
and ambiguity. When I first read these poems I realized Pritchard was a
perfect example of the "ideolectical," about which I write in "The Poetics
of the Americas."  The ideolectical is meant to suggest a synthesis of
dialect and idiolect, centering on the use of nonstandard words and
syntax--whether invented or based on the vernacular.

The opening page of The Matrix gives virtually all the information I know
about Pritchard: Born in New York City in 1939, graduated from NYU,
published in Umbra (a crucial magazine of the Black Arts movement), The New
Black Poetry, as well as The East Village Other. He also performs his
poetry on the 1967 Broadside album, compiled by Walter Lowenfels, New Jazz
Poets. The bio ends with a notice that he teaches a workshop at the New
School and is Poet-in-Residence at Friends Seminary.

Subsequently, I found a copy of his second book, Eecchhooeess, published by
NYU Press in 1971. The book continues the complex, often letter-for-letter
linguistic, visual, and sound play of The Matrix. Taken together,
Pritchard's two books anticipate several of the formally inventive
techniques that would gain greater circulation in the U.S. later in the
70s, though his work is almost never referenced in these contexts because,
within a few years of these two books, the work seemed to disappear from
the poetry horizon. (I recognize the circular reasoning here: lack of
reference erases, the erased are not well enough known to reference; after
all, the work was out there to find.)

Other traces of Pritchard: a magnificent, very short piece on a 1999 album
by Bill Dixon, playing with Tony Oxley, entitled "Quadro Di N.H.
Pritchard"; I am listening to it now and the majestic space between each
note seems to open up a universe inside the one we so often think we are
living in. The album is called Papyrus and it reminds me about what is not
yet lost in our vast trove of paper and digital archives: if only we know
were to look or how to read what we find.

Over time, in which we are all lost, some words, or almost words, jolt us,
jam us, join us, as this from EECCHHOOEESS:

Two Good Quotes


1942 April 5: To write poetry now, even on current events, Brecht feels,
means to withdraw into the ivory tower: 'It's as though one were practic-
ing the art of filigree. There is something eccentric, cranky, obtuse
about it. Such poetry is like the castaway's note in the bottle.  The
battle of Smolensk, too, is fought for poetry.' (Klaus Volker, Brecht

Youlipo is an intersting coinage in light of Pennebaker's research on
suicidal poets use of pronouns
http://homepage.psy.utexas.edu/homepage/faculty/Pennebaker/Reprints/.  May
have implications for Saddam's poetry and Bush's antipoetry?  But the shift

What can poets do?

 I am starting to develop a deja vu feeling.  Some of the things from my
life in the Soviet Union are returning that have been repressed. So what can
poets do?
Apart from doing what a physical body can do - like going out in the
streets, or whatever, and making one’s presence visible  as the opposition
to the regime, in times like these poets could do one very specific thing
that only writers can do – be sensitive to current usage and scrape off the
official ideological shit from the language. I remember a phrase from the
soviet past ‘the wolf is the janitor of the wilderness’ in the sense that
wolves put away sick animals who are unable to run fast. So poets in the
late Soviet times were the janitors of the language. By 1980s the Soviet
official language became so stale that many words became meaningless or
rather  filled with such meanings that one had to be within the context and
know the official doctrine in order to understand. Should I say that what
the ideological apparatus did was to make an attempt to arrest the permanent
sliding of the signifier? Maybe I get it wrong but anyway the ideocratic
state made an attempt to secure  the meanings of words and control
signifying processes so that eventually you could not use lots of words
unless in a joke or in some sort of an ironical sense. It was kind of weird
because it would seem that words are polysemantic and you can actually
switch registers, leave newspeak behind and still go on speaking but what
happened was that the whole language was compromised and contaminated and it
took literally hundreds of poets and prose writers, (D.A. Prigov comes to
mind first) to try and repair the abuse.

(I joined the list after a long break thanks to Maria Damon so this is a way
to re-introduce myself. Sorry if I am out of the discourse)

                by rain
                wind
                frost her
                destiny accomplished

The core of the tower, crude bricks.

Square base, seven stories up and, on top, a temple.

High over the white roofs of the town.  Gypsum and shining asphalt.
Overshadowing the Temple of the Uplifted Head.

God, provided with bed and breakfast.

Basalt statue of lion trampling man.

The hanging gardens--her joy, her monument--always reckoned as a wonder.

                who builds himself no
                monument, once
                dead will
                have no monument, dire-
                membered
                even as the
                bell tone
                decays

The ladder leans.

GB - If you are engaging in this relentless bit of America-baiting in order
to get somebody to call you an ass, well then I will oblige: You are an ass=
.
You clearly know next to nothing of American culture, and come across as a
pompous moron. So stop with this gratuitous trash-talk, okay? I have severa=
l
good Canadian friends, but this cartoon version of America-bashing is ranci=
d
and trite and vomit-inducing, not to mention very much undeserving of a
poet=B9s voice. I only hope you are doing it with your tongue deeply buried
within your cheek and are not being serious, in which case I can agree to
laugh WITH you rather than AT. There are more thoughtful ways to express
outrage over the current war, or the United States, or whatever is your
target here, than to posit absurd notions of brainwashing and quote silly
statistics. I sincerely hope that your words do not represent the average
intellectual level of leftist critique in Canada, as it is pathetic.

No offense GB, really, but my tolerance level for idiocy on all sides has
been awfully low lately. I am sick of the anarchists for carrying molotov
cocktails to a peace rally, sick of the conservatives for reviving the bad
old slogan "Love it or Leave it", sick of the mass media for making light o=
f
dissent, etc. I had hoped the level of debate at a place like the Poetics
Forum would be a little less adolescent than elsewhere, and it usually is.
So let=B9s keep it that way, please, as emotions are already frayed enough!
Many of us are in deep pain over what is happening right now, and don=B9t nee=
d
stupid comments like this latest post by GB to add to the anguish.

Greetings listers,

I'm in the process of deciding where to attend graduate school,
having applied to a variety of programs. In terms of pursuing an
academic career, what is the current thinking on the merits of the
creative writing M.A. vs. the M.F.A. vs. the PhD in, say, comparative
literature?

Specifically, is an M.F.A. superfluous to a student who eventually
intends to obtain a PhD.? Would an M.F.A. holder have to start
afresh in order to obtain a doctorate? Same question for M.A.

Do M.A. holders have difficulty applying their credits to doctorate
programs at different schools?

I'm very attracted to the artistic focus of creative writing programs,
but I'm also cognizant of the practical concerns of educational rank
in the academic hierarchy. I'm a little worried that an M.F.A will
handcuff me when it comes to university teaching jobs.

I'm sure that many of you are well versed in the intricacies of these
issues and I'd be most grateful for your thoughts.

Sincerely,
Brennen Lukas

I wasn't America-baiting. I was US-baiting. Most of America I can get
along with regarding adventures in the middle east. Argentina,
Mexico, Brazil, Chile, Cuba, I can get along with.

Experimental Hypermultiplicity


Anecdotal: "Surging inchoate/incoherent sound." I play Ensoniq Mirage key-
board with positive organ sample as quickly as possible. The rhythm is
fast and furious; the melody is absurdly simple, repeated with
embellishments in C, E, C#, Bb major. Diminished chords, parallel fourths,
fifths, octaves, are employed. The augmented fifth is run up and down the
scale of major seconds. Speed is repeatedly doubled until it falls back,
exhausted. Length of recording: 19 minutes.

Commentary: While playing, each key is clarified; the melody comes through
clearly, as do the numerous errors associated with the speed. I hear the
individual notes; the echo is kept to a minimum. I correct errors as best
as possible by absorbing them in the diminished chords. I am exhilarated.

"Muscular aurality." I play at this speed by adapting potencies within the
muscles themselves; the playing takes on autonomic characteristics, broken
by the focus on errors. The diminished chords are correctives, bringing the
muscles back into focus.

"Internal time consciousness." Time slows, undeniably. I am aware of the
intervals and distances between runs, the melodic timing.

Result: Later, listening to the cd made from the performance. I can no
longer hear the melody, the transformations. Everything surges, ruptures.
The rapidity transforms into gloss, the note sequences into envelopes, the
diminished chords into furious and inchoate sonorities. I am now outside
of the production; from without, the originary turn or moment is lost,
invisible. I have withdrawn from the sound, the music; I hear it, entirely
enveloped in something else, something otherwise. The same has permanently
divided.

Result: Internal time consciousness is not only layered, mobile, flexed;
it is tied into tacit knowledge and attending-to. A production supersedes
its production; it is always that accursed share, that surplus, that both
expands and withdraws the auratic. This is the sound-music of the thinking
body, organ/organelle mind/minding. This is the sequence of the word in
its mythopoeic primordial moment.

Has anyone seen anything on the term used to describe those journalists who
are not "imbedded"?  The term the Anglo-American forces use for freelance
journalists is "unilaterals."

Isn't that clever now.

That means that, hey, the "imbedded" journalists are ... MULTILATERALS.

I have heard NO network journalists talk about this rhetorical ploy. Anyone
heard/read about this?

dear komninos,

yes it is
in fact i got sick for several days
from overworking
but i am better now

i was trying to do it all myself
but now i have been forced
to let go of some of the daily
responsibilites

publishing the m.a.g is one
of the greatest experiences
of my life
second only to
the birth and upbringing
of my daughter who is
now in kindergarten
and just started taking
karate lessons

one of the things that interest me about that word is that is so often used
phrasally, as in 'high dudgeon'. Now my interest goes roughly on these
lines: dictionaries look at words by themselves but it seems that as
semantic units they exist in combinations often, in pairs, that is to say
couplings, or even menages a la trois. Too, one of the points of the
artistic basis of poetry seems to be the ability, or 'knack', of putting
words in unexpected combinations, for example Stevens' 'cool of spent
emotions'. It's the 'cool' that makes the hit there, I reckon, 'spent
emotions', by themselves, wouldn't have much effect ( I'm aware of the
hilarity in the subtexts of what I'm writing as I 'speak' btw!)

consider war is an actualisation of the problematic, the idea of conflict
resolution. the actualisation of the idea is what we see today, in iraq.
war with iraq is bush's idea of a solution. his solution is endorsed by
blair and howard and excuted as but one actualisation to the problem. the
actual is realised by real battles and real casualties, and many possible
battles to come and the possibility of more casualties who will die in this
way.
there have been many previous realisations of war.
the media is quick to compare this war with the last gulf war, or vietnam,
three different realisations of the solution of the actualisation, war, of
the virtual, conflict resolution. but what is gained from asking 'why was
this war different from that war?' because doing so, does not solve the
problems of conflict resolution as an idea. because the problem of conflict
resolution is the virtual, which also has non-violent actualisations. the
virtual questions the idea that violence must be used to obtain power, or
to defend from being overpowered? these are the issues or questions the
virtual seeks to address. and each time war is actualised as a solution,
with its new atrocitries and greater waste of life. each actualisation of
war only answers some questions, creates new problems, new questions in
need of answers.
each actualisation of war is fully realised in the real body counts,
vietnam war:50,000 us troops/5 million vietnamese; gulf war: 135 us
troops/100,000 iraqis. but the virtual remains, and each actualisation
makes everyone re-think their idea of war and question why there are or
should be wars? the virtualisation that comes with each war, the
re-problematising of the idea of how we resolve our differences that
accompanies every attempted solution of it, each actualisation, makes me
re-think myself as a human. to re-think the way i actualise the idea in my
own personal life, in my relationship with my children, lovers, friends,
workmates, family, and community.

the virtual, contains all we know about wars and all the previous
actualisations and real horrors, as well as all that is unknown about this
idea of resolution of difference. and whilst some times we may think of the
virtual as the unknown, or the not there, or not-real, or the make believe
or the possible, it has as much reality as the real, and shouldn't be seen
as its opposite, but the real is a part of the virtual. there are parts of
the virtual we don't yet know about. this provides hope, that in future,
other actualisations may see more humane ways of addressing these cultural,
economic, political differences. one thing is for sure, if war had been the
solution to resolution of differences, there would be no virtual left to
know about, if war was the solution there would be no more war.

Hello polistians,
As part of my dissertation research and general pleasure principal
drive gratification, I'm looking for sound recordings of readings or
lectures by Susan Howe, Nathaniel Mackey, and Robert Duncan. Using
the tools at my disposal, I've found THREE recordings total, one of
which so far is non-circulating for inter-library loan.

Are there folks on the list who have such recordings? I would be glad
to exchange what I get for what I get or to offer recordings moved
from magnetic media to CD-ROM in exchange for recordings. Please
backchannel if you can help me out. JP

Contact Kush, official archivist at New College of California in San
Francisco.  The Poetics Program, in which I taught for 15 years, was founded
for Robert Duncan.  In addition to numerous audio/video tapes of Duncan, Kush
probably has audio tapes of a several day conference on Emily Dickinson, in
which Susan Howe participates, as well as Creeley, Bob Grenier and others.
There is a treasure trove just waiting for someone to use.

Best, Gloria Frym

Masha,

Thanks for taking on the question, which I see from how I asked it was
already slipping out of its green pod of *what can poetry do?* to a blue pod
of *what can poets do?*  It's no doubt a symptom of the illusion of my
fluctuating "I"-- in that I'd like to believe there is agency, and
experience would seem to bear it out, but so many better thinkers than I
have already decided the question is moot.  Or so I've been loudly reminded
in some academic settings.  Nothing lost, then, by asking, right?

I think when I asked about what poetry can do the other day it was while
heading out of a loop about war and morality (the question was: is war
wrong? and yes, it is always wrong, as I was roundly reminded by Aryanil).
It was a note more of exasperation on (yet again) realizing the disparity
between knowing of (that day's and countless days of) brute acts of war, and
a growing sense of (my own and many others I'm sure) futility about how even
when poetry is most adequate an agitation to the larger *desiring machine*
it is not much of a match for *manunkind*'s other favorite rhetorical
(brute-physical) machinations or (now bushy-cnn-marked) real and symbolic
wmds.  Perhaps this is intellectualizing too much?--as I've also recently
been reminded.

But in view of what you explained about poetry and the past era of Russian
poetry/language, would you care to comment on how that tendency may or may
not have evolved there to the present?  Email me directly if you'd prefer
that venue.  Again, thanks for so thoughtful a response.

Chris Murray

This quote reminds me to mention that (apropos of Gabe's
question) there's a good interview with Robert Fisk called
"Un-Embedded Journalist," just up on ZNet:

http://www.zmag.org/content/showarticle.cfm?SectionID=36&ItemID=3323

It's too long to copy here but well worth reading. Fisk is
in Baghdad reporting for the Independent: "[A]s the Deputy
Prime Minister Tariq Aziz said a few hours ago, I was
listening to him in person, the Americans expected to be
greeted with roses and music - and they were greeted with
bullets."

very intersting post, Masha.  I do think there are several issues at stake
here but clearly one is the media's role as embedded or in bed with and this
list has the potential to gather views internationally

this from Europe (Reiner Strasser):

As far as I know - there seems to be a wide distance between what is
reported (in TV) in (old - sic!) europe and the (modern - sic!) US.
Every second sentences in any german report is - the information are not
secure. There are some independant journalists around in Bagdad - i believe?
that especially the sat phone interviews are not censured by the iraquian
regime (but information are poor). --- I do not tell - that the european
media are neutral or objective.
Many nations in the UN have declare that they are against this war (except
some known bigger countries there is no real information about who is in the
alliance with the US in this war).
In opposite to all the nations manifesting there opposition to this war in
the UN - the war began.
How shall these countries (governments) react? Ban the US? (haha)
Unfortunately at the moment american right (the right of the current
american government) seems to be THE international right. (Right? - sic!)
In Germany, France etcetera they are talking about human actions/help after
(or eventually during) the war .................... hands seem to be bound
(everywhere)........ The child is fallen in the
A key function at the moment (in my sight) has the american media
manipulating the viewers (or is it really the "american mentality after
09-11?) ........... Are there any public (TV) critical statements allowed in
the US in these times? What has happened with free speech?

Am I now on a black or red list in the US?

How is this seen from Uruguay and Russia or elsewhere even if nor written in
standard English?


a second issue relates to pronoun usage as poets.  I write as a poet or as a
person, we write, I write about you seeing tanks approaching Basra where you
are someone seeing them via satelite via CNN as your TV blanks?

"The Prescription Drug Challenge"
by Carl Martin

It was while popping members of the "triptan" family
That I began dreaming of the South African killer bee.
Trapped inside a diamond shaped molecule its sticky, yellow venom
Slides inside its slick confinement like wind sliding
Through the furry cuffs of the pussy willow.
This bee is a good swimmer, but not a great swimmer
Though its talent has been honed bouncing through the waves
The spray and loneliness of the South Coast.
I know deep in the knobby, long distance knees of the soul
That it has not spread all the pollen that I would like to spread with it.
Somehow, in my wise inclinations I fear that this is a truly American
"Stinger," a short spanned hum-vee of the wild Florida grasses
Plowing through the airs and porches like a long-legged advert
In ways that Maeterlinck could never have imagined,
Not even poetically, "just as Deborah, whose name means Bee"
Judged Israel--in a story I may not actually have read.
This is the way the blind see, even in Miami. Jehovah forgive us
And excise from the brain: the flesh, the hubbub, and the rub
For sometimes through the digital transference that is all we see
Though the light is blinding.
And the contest never as numbing as we would like.

on the streets by yourself, Wm Ww, fishing for storied print
grieve away, I’ll console you and we’ll exult
pulp outward, composers harp on the rapidity
which notes grind, persuasive advertisements
unaccompanied by lecture, quick as a laugh
landscape is about us, long before image or word
your persistence arranged to share the name
the new tone to outstrip prodigious coaches
Wm. Wormswork expected a home for indoor opulence
impatient now, they wept your words back to you
accessible beauty of a larger threshold
Mr. Hole's’s wooden mood susceptible to maintenance
that text an expanse carries, blue over its blemish
a great name smacks of a battery of finalists!
this is your story, too – have fun with it
lose your honesty, that stingy music lulls
more than a great organ’s conceited noise
corpses will not mind if hours are added to your days
nor will your mortality hurt them, who’ll verify this, Will?
the living have dressed for success, cruelty to wake them...

cemetery dances, pass them by without recovering from your bit of
candle, they easily class themselves within a narrow bonhomie
I have read a second time who gets by in that business
after a lounge, Wm. Wormswork's petrified by theatrical splendor
these entertainers have given up their old humble knowledge
founder of a vague notion for his daily rendezvous
their performance attempted the halftone as
only a great mimic has caught, Virginia's urgency
reluctant words deplore his wasted image
monumental pretense, such half-lights consistent with spite
imprisonment of wickedness a beautiful insurance
undivided suffix decked with tentative inscriptions
the third word armed with a sheer drop, a phrase
ignorant of candor, such dance resides in the letter V

The Houston police broke into a gay couple's home WHILE THEY WERE HAVING SEX
and ARRESTED THEM FOR SODOMY?  That is FUCKED.

It seems that in Texas if you've been fucked in the ass they'll send you to
jail, but if you've been FUCKED IN THE HEAD they'll make you Governor.  Or
President, for that matter.

Jesus FUCKING Christ!!!

It was bad enough we North Carolinians elected Jesse Helms over and over,
apparently in an effort to help Jesse and his cracker pals gang-rape the

I hope Texas will secede, so that Texans may have the right to save

Court hears challenge to Texas sodomy ban
By Michael Kirkland
UPI Legal Affairs Correspondent
From the Washington Politics & Policy Desk
Published 3/26/2003 2:03 PM

WASHINGTON, March 26 (UPI) -- The Supreme Court, in a case that reaches to
the core of American values, heard argument Wednesday on whether Texas or
any other state can ban private homosexual conduct between consenting
adults.

A gay couple -- charged with violating the sodomy ban after police entered a
Houston area home and found them having sex -- is challenging the Texas ban.

Speaking for the couple before the Supreme Court Wednesday, Washington
attorney Paul Smith said his clients were asking the court to rule on more
than just the unfairness of the law.

The Texas statute applies only to homosexuals, and the couple contends that
violates the 14th Amendment's guarantee of equal protection under the law.

Smith said his clients are also asking the Supreme Court to recognize "the
right of all adult couples, whether same-sex or not, to be free from all
forms of government intrusion into their chosen method of sexual
expression."

Speaking for Texas, Harris County District Attorney Charles Rosenthal Jr.
said the Lone Star State's ban "does not violate the 14th Amendment ...
because the Constitution has never recognized a fundamental right to engage
in extra-marital sex."

Moreover, the law targets homosexual conduct, Rosenthal said, not
homosexuals themselves.

Texas and Kansas ban homosexual sodomy outright. Missouri enforces its ban
in only parts of the state. Oklahoma's ban against sodomy by heterosexuals
and homosexuals alike has been reduced by a court ruling to a ban against
homosexuals only.

Another nine states ban sodomy, or anal sex, for everyone, at least outside
of marriage.

"At the most specific level," Texas told the Supreme Court in a brief before
the argument, "the nation has a long-standing tradition, only recently
waning, of criminalizing anal sodomy -- the offense once known as
'buggery' -- as a serious criminal offense."

The Supreme Court last ruled in 1986's Bowers vs. Hardwick that homosexual
conduct was not protected by the Constitution. The decision upheld Georgia's
sodomy ban. The Texas two men are asking the justices to reverse that 1986
precedent.

Sheriff's deputies entered John Lawrence's home late in the evening of Sept.
17, 1998, to investigate what turned out to be a false report from a
neighbor of a "weapon disturbance."

"There, they intruded on Lawrence and (Tyron) Garner having sex," the men's
petition said.

After being convicted in a justice of the peace court, the men filed motions
to suppress the charges on the grounds that the law is unconstitutional.

When those motions failed, the men pleaded no contest, were found guilty and
paid $200 fines, plus court costs.

Though a three-judge panel of the state Court of Appeals reversed the men's
convictions under the Texas Equal Rights Amendment, the full appeals court
reversed.

The Supreme Court of the United States then agreed to review the case.

In Wednesday's argument, Smith constantly reinforced his argument that the
case involved a fundamental right of all people, not just a violation of the
equal protection clause that affected homosexuals.

Only one member of the nine-member court actively questioned him. Justice
Antonin Scalia repeatedly probed Smith's argument for weaknesses.

The law unfairly targets homosexuals, Smith argued. Even Texas concedes that
the sexual conduct of married couples cannot be regulated.

"Maybe so," Scalia shot back, "but I haven't conceded it."

Smith tried to parry Scalia's contention that a fundamental right had to be
recognized throughout the nation's history before it could be recognized by
the courts. Some rights evolve, Smith said.

"The American people have moved on to where they assume that (sexual) right
is available to everyone," Smith said. "They would be shocked if they knew"
that some states still ban sodomy.

In making his argument for Texas, Rosenthal repeatedly emphasized states'
rights.

The Supreme Court settled the matter in its 1986 decision in the Georgia
case, he said, adding, "We believe Bowers vs. Hardwick is good law."

As for Smith's argument on the evolution of public attitudes, Rosenthal
said, "There's nothing in the values or mores of our country that have
changed" since Bowers. "There is no fundamental right."

If a change in the law should be made, Rosenthal argued, it should come
"from the Statehouse of Texas, not this court," and the impetus should come
from "the people of Texas."

Texas has the right to regulate any sexual behavior, up to a certain "line,"
when it doesn't approve of the behavior, Rosenthal insisted: "It's our
position that line should drawn at the marital bedroom."

Not all of Wednesday's argument was serious, and several exchanges drew
laughter from the audience.

Justice Stephen Breyer told Rosenthal it appeared that Texas was claiming
the right to ban private sexual behavior simply because it didn't like it.

From the bench, Breyer quoted in its entirety a poem written in 1680 by an
Oxford student, Tom Brown, who was temporarily "sent down," or expelled, by
a professor, Dr. John Fell.

"I do not love thee, Dr. Fell, The reason why I cannot tell; But this alone
I know full well, I do not love thee, Dr. Fell."

The Supreme Court should rule on the case before recessing for the summer in
late June or early July.

<snip>
dictionaries look at words by themselves but it seems that as
semantic units they exist in combinations
<snip>

Cf frame semantics. The idea is that words exist within a semantic frame.
This is partly just the idea of context: a 'hearse' requires the context of
a funeral. But it goes beyond context in that (crudely) a frame will
comprise both concepts (death, mourning, etc) and frame elements (deceased,
mode of disposal, bereaved, mourners etc), some of which will be local
primitives (body, grave etc).

In a dictionary, various and disparate meanings are organised under the same
headword. In a thesaurus, the headword is a concept under which are entries
broadly consonant with that concept but varying widely as to context.

Under the entry for 'bury' in a dictionary organised by frames (to imagine
such a thing) might be semantic information about the elements making up the
frame (thus 'bury' and 'cremate' would be alternates of the frame element
*mode of disposal*) and also syntactic information (the mourners bury the
deceased, not vice versa, for example).

I hope I've got that right.

At any rate an explanation of collocations such as 'high dudgeon' might
usefully draw on that style of analysis, as upon the general principle that,
as well as being *heat*, anger is frequently, metaphorically *up* (blowing
up, flaring up, getting one's temper or one's dander up and so on and so
forth)

<snip>
one of the points of the artistic basis of poetry seems to be the ability,
or 'knack', of putting
words in unexpected combinations
<snip>

Related both to what you say and what I say above is the idea of 'webplay'.
This term was invented by the lexicographer and Dickinson specialist Cynthia
Hallen to describe ED's habit of introducing into poems items (including
etymologies) found in the definitions of headwords found in the family
dictionary, which was the 1844 reprint of Webster's 1841 edition.

Dear Brennen,

I don't know if I can sum up all my thoughts about doing MFA vs. PhD in one
succinct email, but I wanted to write you (via backchannel) because I did
both.

The comment about your having stumbled into the proverbial hornet's nest may
have been puzzling.  Many of the people on this list are highly suspicious
of MFA programs because there is the sense that MFA programs
institutionalize a kind of bland writing that deadens poetic practice.  If
you are interested in hearing a fuller elaboration of this, you might take a
look at Rasula, Jed. The American Poetry Wax Museum:  Reality Effects,
1940-1990. Refiguring English Studies. Ed. Stephen M. North. Urbana:
National Council of Teachers of English, 1996.  Rasula historicizes the
emergence of writing programs.  I just happened to be reading his book for
some work on my dissertation.  In his last chapter especially he goes into
some detail about MFA programs and how they are tied to an impulse in
American letters to canonize and standardize, a propensity that he links to
New Critical reading practices propagated in the postwar period.  This book
is out of print but probably available at most university and college
libraries.   Not that you NEED to read Rasula's chapter to make a decision
about grad school, but when I read this I wished that I'd had a bit more of
a context when I chose to go to an MFA program.

This is not to say that all MFA programs will turn all their students into
creative writing drones churning out more or less similar first-person
accounts of their inner lives (that model of poetry as therapy).  I went to
the program at University of Michigan straight out of college, really
without knowing very much about it, but I was fortunate to stumble into the
workshops of Alice Fulton, whose work I respect a great deal.  She made it
her business to try to wean young poets off of that model of the private
lyric poet of the personal.  Her work was experimental, compared to that of
others teaching in the program, and she was interested in public issues and
politics.  I appreciate that influence to this day.

That said, it could be a blessing to have two years to write poetry while
taking a few classes, if you can afford it.  Also the cultures of some MFA
programs are focused on publication.  If that is what you want, to write new
poems, send them out, maybe get a few published, and perhaps begin to
collect poems for a future manuscript, the MFA may be one way to start.  I
think if you do a PhD you may never "return" to do the MFA.  The PhD is such
a long road--really a little career in and of itself-- that you may be
pretty burnt out on school by the time you're finished. On the other hand,
maybe you don't need an MFA to write poems and publish them.  Granted a PhD
program could take so much of your time that you might not find time to
write, but if you surround yourself with like minded creative writing types,
sign up to teach creative writing classes, and start your own writing group,
you could have the same effect.  University of Buffalo (SUNY) has a poetics
PhD program, which seems to produce a lot of scholar-poets.  People who
write books of poems AND produce scholarly essays on poetry and poetics.  At
one time Cornell University had a joint MFA-PhD program, in which you sort
of do both degrees concurrently.  I don't know if they still have this, but
you could certainly check out their web site.  (Speaking of Cornell, I think
that's where Alice Fulton is right now.)

The question you're asking is an interesting one, in part because, as you
may already have discovered, there is generally a sort of schism between MFA
programs and the English Departments in which they are housed.  This
sometimes emerges as defensive antintellectualism, including fear of theory,
on the part of MFA students (and sometimes MFA faculty) and dismissiveness
on the part of PhD students (and faculty).  I don't want to alarm you with
such generalizations, but that is what I have observed, and it is a tendency
that Rasula confirms in his book. Perhaps you could be a person who bridges
the gap between these two worlds, since there's no reason to think poetry
can't be critical, theoretical, or intellectual; and no reason to thing
criticism can't be creative, carefully crafted, even lyrical.

Again I think Rasula's little (and sometimes polemical) history might be a
useful way to contextualize your decision, but you don't have to take his or
anyone else's looking askance at MFA programs as a verdict on your desires.
If you pick a place where you know you will can work with someone whose work
you respect, you could make your experience at an MFA program as rigorous as
you want.  (Especially if you take the "serious" scholarly coursework that
most of your MFA colleagues will not bother with--again that was my
experience.)  Keep in mind too that PhD programs don't mean the end of your
creative writing life.  On the contrary, my writing has really changed in
exhilarating ways thanks to the scholarly work I have done.  Studying Susan
Howe, for example, has inspired me a lot and changed the way I see what
poetry can do and what materials are at my disposal.

There are also questions of career beyond grad school.  There are two kinds
of jobs you could get as a result of your training.  MFAs with books
published can get jobs teaching creative writing, sometimes in other MFA
programs.  Whereas PhDs have a different set of jobs to apply to--jobs where
you teach mostly scholarly courses, and perhaps composition, but probably
not creative writing.  Some jobs on the most recent MLA job list actually
asked for applicants that could do both.  (I don't know much about doctoral
programs in creative writing, like the one at Denver, but they strike me as
just really long MFA programs.)

Where are you? Are you finished with undergrad work?  What do your advisors,
if any, say in response to your question? Good luck to you, and keep in
touch if need be,

Maria Elena

Greetings listers,

I'm in the process of deciding where to attend graduate school,
having applied to a variety of programs. In terms of pursuing an
academic career, what is the current thinking on the merits of the
creative writing M.A. vs. the M.F.A. vs. the PhD in, say, comparative
literature?

Specifically, is an M.F.A. superfluous to a student who eventually
intends to obtain a PhD.? Would an M.F.A. holder have to start
afresh in order to obtain a doctorate? Same question for M.A.

Do M.A. holders have difficulty applying their credits to doctorate
programs at different schools?

I'm very attracted to the artistic focus of creative writing programs,
but I'm also cognizant of the practical concerns of educational rank
in the academic hierarchy. I'm a little worried that an M.F.A will
handcuff me when it comes to university teaching jobs.

I'm sure that many of you are well versed in the intricacies of these
issues and I'd be most grateful for your thoughts.

Sincerely,
Brennen Lukas

I can understand the feeling of frustration, MWP. But I don't see what's so
inflammatory about George Bowering's comment. Really, if the Pledge of
Allegiance is not a form of brainwashing, then what is it? At least, it's
getting a good early start on inculcating the citizenry with jingoistic
patriotism. Do you think there would be as much support for this idiotic war as
there is if so many people weren't patriotically stultified by the mere sight
of stars and stripes?

On the other hand, Mr. Bowering, I don't see any reason for you to act so high
and mighty. That is, I seem to recall maple leaves flying in my
elementary-school classrooms, and singing "Oh Canada we stand on guard for
thee" every morning before class.

Thanks to George Bowering for saying about America what needs to be said.=20
Say it again and again and again, George.

One of the weird things I've been noticing about American political=20
discourse is that it's almost not there. There is this weird taboo here=20
about talking "politics." Last week I heard three people yell --yell-- when=
=20
someone brought up the war. I heard a war supporter yell, "Shut the fuck=20
up!" to someone who said that though he supported the war he was sickened=20
by the bombing in Baghdad.

Last Thursday when i went to an anti-war rally, I asked students in my=20
intro to cw class to, while I was gone, to write a collaborative=20
stichomythia about the war, one voice opposing and one supporting (no=20
middle ground allowed in the tradition of some stichomythia I perversely=20
told them, ). When the students began to discuss the war as they=20
collaborated in their groups, two students -- both avowed republicans --=20
began verbally abusing the other students, telling them they ought to shut=
 up.

MWP's response to you, George, is I'm afraid what has replaced regular talk=
=20
in the States: appeals to shut up, be quiet, that our tolerance is at an=20
end, that we're "sick" of all this or of all that: it's common rhetoric in=
=20
the States, though I've no idea if MWP is American, it's kind of an=20
American rhetorical tactic: yokel A saying he/she is sick or offended and=20
that it is therefore incumbent upon yokel B to shut up.

I live in central Illinois, in a pretty cool couple of towns (one of which=
=20
is called "Normal"), and I wear a magnetic 4x6 sticker on my car that says=
=20
NO IRAQ WAR. But since last week I've found large screws in two of my tires=
=20
and oil smeared all over one of my doors. Now I leave my sticker on when I=
=20
drive around or when I park the car outside my apartment. But when I park=20
on campus near the frat houses, I remove teh sticker.

Appeals to shut up, be quiet; statements to the effect that tolerance is=20
running thin: these happen in violent communities. RAther than "talk=20
politics" most Americans just "receive politics" -- from cnn, fox, abc, nbc=
=20
-- or they shout people down. This is a place where the BBC is considered a=
=20
"liberal" medium.

Keep it up, George.

Gabe

what can poets do
Was it Khlebnikov who, after a girl rejected him, said 'What can i do? Maybe
write still better poetry?" A lot is implied here. Did he mean to say, among
other things, that he had one body or rather did he insist on having just
one body?
and another quotation: in his work "Party Organization and Party Literature"
Lenin said that 'all literature should be Party literature' but all
literature IS party literature. i want to write more about Russian poetry
after perestroika in terms what it did to the language but today is a bad
day.

Subject: what poets can do


Masha,

Thanks for taking on the question, which I see from how I asked it was
already slipping out of its green pod of *what can poetry do?* to a blue pod
of *what can poets do?*  It's no doubt a symptom of the illusion of my
fluctuating "I"-- in that I'd like to believe there is agency, and
experience would seem to bear it out, but so many better thinkers than I
have already decided the question is moot.  Or so I've been loudly reminded
in some academic settings.  Nothing lost, then, by asking, right?

I think when I asked about what poetry can do the other day it was while
heading out of a loop about war and morality (the question was: is war
wrong? and yes, it is always wrong, as I was roundly reminded by Aryanil).
It was a note more of exasperation on (yet again) realizing the disparity
between knowing of (that day's and countless days of) brute acts of war, and
a growing sense of (my own and many others I'm sure) futility about how even
when poetry is most adequate an agitation to the larger *desiring machine*
it is not much of a match for *manunkind*'s other favorite rhetorical
(brute-physical) machinations or (now bushy-cnn-marked) real and symbolic
wmds.  Perhaps this is intellectualizing too much?--as I've also recently
been reminded.

But in view of what you explained about poetry and the past era of Russian
poetry/language, would you care to comment on how that tendency may or may
not have evolved there to the present?  Email me directly if you'd prefer
that venue.  Again, thanks for so thoughtful a response.

Chris Murray

GG=B9s comments on the straw man he has prefabulated from my words are so
exasperatingly off base that I don=B9t know where to begin in responding.
Maybe silence, then (to paraphrase Ashbery), should have the last word, at
least from my end, as there doesn=B9t seem to be any way otherwise to free
myself from the great sucking morass of confusion on this topic that seems
to be getting stickier by the minute. Nonetheless, I will continue to speak
out against bigotry and hatred wherever it emerges and against whomever it
is directed (including Americans); and if that causes people like GG to
emerge from the muck to accuse me of saying exactly the opposite of what I
stand for, I can only hope that the clarity of my original words will speak
for themselves to those who know how to read.

I say the word "body" into
a wind of room;  vintage
unknown, but hair sandwiched
between clasps of war, ashy

like "civilian casualties." Over
here it's morning again; whole
roads are free of rubble, stones
are where they belong (in stores

and fast-food palaces, republic'd)
(not "embedded" in a percussive
tuck, in "news"). Ah! Your suspect
awakening, so fitful and upset

by dreaming rodents in the house!
Over there it's all gale-force(d) womb...

Powell: "Fuck the U.N."

By BURTON HALLEY
The Assassinated Press



They hang the man and flog the woman
That steal the goose from off the common,
But let the greater villain loose
That steals the common from the goose.

Constant apprehension of war has the same tendency
to render the head too large for the body.  A standing military
force with an overgrown executive will not long be safe.
companions to liberty.  -- Thomas Jefferson


"America is a quarter of a billion people totally misinformed and disinformed
by their government. This is tragic but our media is -- I wouldn't even say
corrupt -- it's just beyond telling us anything that the government doesn't
want us to know."

Gore Vidal

Dear Friends,

Please consider adding your name to the following
statement. If, after reading it, you like what it
has to say, please take a few seconds to visit
http://www.zmag.org/wspj and add your name to the
statement. The statement was released on March 27,
2003, and already more than 73 have signed on!

I stand for peace and justice.

I stand for democracy and autonomy. I don’t think the U.S. or any other country should ignore the popular will and violate and weaken international law, seeking to bully and bribe votes in the Security Council.

I stand for internationalism. I oppose any nation spreading an ever expanding network of military bases around the world and producing an arsenal unparalleled in the world.

I stand for equity. I don’t think the U.S. or any other country should seek empire. I don’t think the U.S. ought to control Middle Eastern oil on behalf of U.S. corporations and as a wedge to gain political control over other countries.

I stand for freedom. I oppose brutal regimes in Iraq and elsewhere but I also oppose the new doctrine of &ldquo;preventive war,&rdquo; which guarantees permanent and very dangerous conflict, and is the reason why the U.S. is now regarded as the major threat to peace in much of the world. I stand for a democratic foreign policy that supports popular opposition to imperialism, dictatorship, and political fundamentalism in all its forms.

I stand for solidarity. I stand for and with all the poor and the excluded. Despite massive disinformation millions oppose unjust, illegal, immoral war, and I want to add my voice to theirs. I stand with moral leaders all over the world, with world labor, and with the huge majority of the populations of countries throughout the world.

I stand for diversity. I stand for an end to racism directed against immigrants and people of color. I stand for an end to repression at home and abroad.

I stand for peace. I stand against this war and against the conditions, mentalities, and institutions that breed and nurture war and injustice.

I stand for sustainability. I stand against the destruction of forests, soil, water, environmental resources, and biodiversity on which all life depends.

I stand for justice. I stand against economic, political, and cultural institutions that promote a rat race mentality, huge economic and power inequalities, corporate domination even unto sweatshop and slave labor, racism, and gender and sexual hierarchies.

I stand for a policy that redirects the money used for war and military spending to provide healthcare, education, housing, and jobs.

I stand for a world whose political, economic, and social institutions foster solidarity, promote equity, maximize participation, celebrate diversity, and encourage full democracy.

I stand for peace and justice and, more, I pledge to work for peace and justice.

Subject: [gulfwar-2] Der Standard in Austria admits censorship by
Coalition

On the website of the best Austrian dailoy Der Standard
(www.derstandard.at) the editors explain that all information about
the battlefield is controlled by the coalition and that it continues
to be not even close to reality. On the Home-page under the
heading "IN EIGENER SACHE". One of the few media outlets that
acknowledges tha censorship by the western-governments openly and
that the editors therefore cannot accept responsibility for the
truthfullness of the news.
(I called them and two editors explained how they had to pressure the
leadership from the paper to do this.)

> > > > Synopsis: The 12hr-ISBN-JPEG Project began December 30, 1994. A
`round-the-clock posting of sequenced hypermodern imagery from Brad Brace.
The hypermodern minimizes the familiar, the known, the recognizable; it
suspends identity, relations and history. This discourse, far from
determining the locus in which it speaks, is avoiding the ground on which
it could find support. It is trying to operate a decentering that leaves
no privilege to any center.


                       The 12-hour ISBN JPEG Project
                       -----------------------------
                          began December 30, 1994


  Pointless Hypermodern Imagery... posted/mailed every 12 hours... a
spectral, trajective alignment for the 00`s! A continuum of minimalist
masks in the face of catastrophe; conjuring up transformative metaphors
for the everyday... A poetic reversibility of exclusive events...

        A post-rhetorical, continuous, apparently random sequence of
imagery...  genuine gritty, greyscale...  corruptable, compact,
collectable and compelling convergence. The voluptuousness of the grey
imminence: the art of making the other disappear. Continual visual impact;
an optical drumming, sculpted in duration, on the endless present of the
Net.

  An extension of the printed ISBN-Book (0-9690745) series... critically
unassimilable... imagery is gradually acquired, selected and re-sequenced
over time...  ineluctable, vertiginous connections. The 12hr dialtone...

                     [ see ftp.idiom.com/users/bbrace/netcom/books.txt ]

KEYWORDS: >> Disconnected, disjunctive, distended, de-centered,
   de-composed, ambiguous, augmented, ambilavent, homogeneous, reckless...

   poetic, plural, perverse, potent, prophetic, pathological, pointless...
>> Emergent, evolving, eccentric, eclectic, egregious, exciting,
   entertaining, evasive, entropic, erotic, entrancing, enduring,
   expansive...

trade `em, print `em, even publish them...

~ This interminable, relentless sequence of imagery began in earnest on
December 30, 1994. The basic structure of the project has been over
twenty-four years in the making. While the specific sequence of
photographs has been presently orchestrated for more than 12 years` worth
of 12-hour postings, I will undoubtedly be tempted to tweak the ongoing
publication with additional new interjected imagery. Each 12-hour posting
is like the turning of a page; providing ample time for reflection,
interruption, and assimilation.

still exist for financially assisting the publication of editions of large
(33x46") prints; perhaps (Iris giclees) inkjet duotones or extended-black
quadtones. Other supporters receive rare copies of the first three
web-offset printed ISBN-Books. Contributions and requests for
12hr-email-subscriptions, can also be made at

I think that anyone who believes that the United
States armed forces are not bending over backwards to
avoid killing or injuring Iraqi civilians is insane.
One can even suspect that they are doing so for
political rather than humanitarian reasons, and retain
one's leftist standing.  The point is, that they are
doing so, occasional misfires notwithstanding.
Otherwise, how can one account for the number of
civilians in Baghdad who are still alive?

Now, then, anyone for a discussion of poetry?

forum who is certain he lacks sufficient pertinent

This term was invented by the lexicographer and Dickinson specialist Cynthia
Hallen to describe ED's habit of introducing into poems items (including
etymologies) found in the definitions of headwords found in the family
dictionary, which was the 1844 reprint of Webster's 1841 edition.<


I like this notion of 'webplay' and too the sense of the relation to the
wordy arts of the ludic. Here I'm pondering though, very heavily, the
questions of neologisms, of when they work and when they don't. I'm quite
adept at them myself, but as far as I can work out it comes down to matters
of timing and 'fitness', a lovely old sense of a word.

Then I shall go off to play in an etymological sandpit!!!!!!

All the Best

How much data does it take before one can have a "worthwhile opinion"?
Surely you're not suggesting we should leave the opinions to Those Who
Know, like, say, the administration.

Hey, I'm not sure the administration has that much data.  Facts are stupid
things anyway.

For instance, see Timothy Garton Ash on the Kurds:

A lot more than I have (and I'm sure I know less than
most of the people sounding off about the war here but
that's not saying much) about the history of the
middle east, what's been going on in Iraq, about the
terrorist network, about our own military
capabilities,
about the Iraqi people, about the oil situation, about
the psychology of all the peoples of the area, about
the US administrationand its possible ulterior
motives, and much else that I lack the data (and
interest--since art is much more important to me than
history or politics) to know I'd need to know.

They have vastly better data than I have, I'm sure.  I
doubt that they know too well what they're doing, but
I suspect they know better than their loudest critics.
 And similar people did get us to the moon.  Whose
opinion would I trust on this (minor) question?  You
got me.

National Islamic group urges FBI to join investigation




     AMERICAN MUSLIM NEWS BRIEF | 3/26/2003

The Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) today
called on federal authorities to aid the investigation
of an incident in Indiana that left a Muslim
businessman with burns over 60 percent of his body.

The Washington-based Islamic civil rights and advocacy
group says the 37-year-old Afghanistan native was
injured Monday night at his restaurant in
Indianapolis, Indiana. According to media reports, the
man told officials he was cleaning up in the kitchen
when two people burst in and set him on fire. Fire and
police investigators tell CAIR that there is an
ongoing investigation and that no possible motive is
being ruled out.

SEE: MOTIVE SOUGHT IN RESTAURANT FIRE

"While the motive in this case is not yet clear, local
authorities could benefit greatly from the resources
and expertise of the FBI. Federal involvement would
also help reassure the Muslim community in Indiana
that their safety is a priority," said CAIR Executive
Director Nihad Awad. Awad added that CAIR recently
distributed a "Community Safety Kit" to help protect
Muslims in North America during the war with Iraq.

SEE:
http://www.cair-net.org/safetykit

A number of anti-Muslim incidents have been reported
recently across the United States. CAIR attributes
these incidents to the pro-war rhetoric leading up to
the attack on Iraq, coupled with existing levels of
anti-Muslim bias in American society.

Just last Saturday, an explosive device destroyed an
Illinois Muslim family's van. In other Illinois
incidents, an Evanston resident received a mailed
death threat, a Glendale Heights Islamic center
received a phoned bomb threat and projectiles were
fired at a mosque in Villa Park. In California, four
Muslim women visiting a restaurant were verbally
assaulted by another patron who made references to
raping Muslim women and threatened them with physical
assault. Death threats were made against Muslim
students at San Jose State University in Northern
California. In Michigan, a Muslim father and son
report that they were refused service at a Meijer
store in Fraser,Mich.

Physical assaults against Muslims have been reported
in Northern California, Southern California, Georgia,
New
Jersey, and South Carolina. One incident in Yorba
Linda, Calif., left a Muslim teenager badly beaten by
a group that allegedly included white supremacists.

CAIR is America's largest Islamic civil liberties
group. It is headquartered in Washington, D.C., and
has 16 regional offices nationwide and in Canada.
Since its founding in 1994, CAIR has defended the
civil and religious rights of all Americans.

They also had vastly better data when "they" invaded Cuba at the Bay
of  Pigs, invaded Vietnam, squashed Mosadegh and supported the Shah, etc.
The data comes from biased sources--biased because all along the line, from
informant to handler to receiver at whatever espionage agency, there's an
impulse to tell the boss what he wants to hear-- and is then filtered by
folks with axes to grind--they know the results they want their data to
demonstrate. And they haven't been doing a very good job of getting it

Which is why it behooves us to do our own research and our own deciding.

one cannot believe that "data" can be "objective" or
that public policy in this country--in any country, I
guess--can be "determined" by such "data".

what art do you make in a city whose walls are falling
down?

such necessary art we made together in Union Square
and on all the bulletin boards after our buildings
fell down.

June 1993: President Clinton fires 23 Tomahawk
missiles at military targets in Baghdad in retaliation
for the supposed plot against Old George--7 missiles
land in residential areas--one utterly demolishing the
house of Laila Al-Attar, the director of Iraq's
national gallery of art; Laila was killed, but also
the bulk of her work--she had been preparing for a
retrospective of her life work--was incinerated.

Art, politics, and history converge into obscenity.
The night (Arabic: "Lail") perfumed ("Attar") with
fire.

Mohammad was approached by cynical crowds saying
"prove you are a prophet. 'Isa healed the sick and
raised the dead. Musa split the Red Sea and led his
people through the corridor of water. What will you
do?" Mohammad pointed into the night sky at the full
moon, which had split asunder.

Who accuses and with what misinformation. Remember the
Maine. Alamo. Pearl Harbor.

We will never finish until

You will not now nor will you ever

Now comes the building unflowered

Now the night combusts
the moon splits itself in half

and what will you how
when will you now

Car?  Did you say ~car!?~


People are posting messages that the Iraq war is about
oil, and meanwhile you're ~driving a CAR!!?~


If it's about oil, man, then we're bombing Baghdad so
that YOU (please note: YOU) can drive around Illinois.


What, isn't there room enough on your car for a "STOP
GLOBAL WARMING" bumper sticker, too?


It's real simple, Gabe. It works like this:

car = Iraq war


STOP DRIVING.

Not a War Poem

I am feeling calm.
It is a sin to be so
at this time.

They say that at the moment
of intense imminent danger,
at the edge of death,
one feels calm.

Perhaps the inevitability of it all
raises the soul above
and brings it back to nothing--
the world is not here; it hides
beyond what we can see.

- Jill Chan

On the topic of media coverage, see the below message from Move-On.org,
which has been among the most important organizers of recent protests, for
specific action you can take to effect change in the way this war is being
reported.

Simply put, the media is not doing its job. Used to be there was a notion of
a newspaper, radio station, or TV station "serving its community" with equal
time for opinions, equal coverage, and most importantly a sense of
RESPONSIBILITY for the best interests of the community. Nowadays, we are so
used to corporate ownership of these institutions that we don't expect these
things.

I, for one, can't even watch/listen to/read the bogus non-coverage that is
spewing from our nation's various media outlets like so much processed turd.
And I really believe that if the tide of public opinion is going to be
turned, it has to start with fair and incisive coverage.

best,

David Hadbawnik

Dear MoveOn member,

Our country is at war, and many of us continue to feel grief
and anger that this terrible conflict is being fought on our
behalf.  It's a hard time.

It's also a critical time for us to stay involved.  As we report
below, together we've had some amazing successes over the last
month, both domestically and in opposition to this war.  We
need to keep this momentum building.  As a next step, please
consider joining MoveOn's Media Corps -- a group of committed
online activists who will keep the media accountable.  Help
make sure that our news media report the war the way it
happens, not the way the Bush Administration wishes it would
happen.

You can sign up now at:

   http://www.moveon.org/mediacorps/

American media outlets have chosen to stifle or simply not
show the most terrible and saddening aspects of this war.
They are reluctant to air the voices of critics who are raising
important questions about its effectiveness and purpose.  And
they appear to have acceded to the Bush Administration's
desire to black out pictures or footage of civilian
casualties.

Now more than ever, it's important that the media report the
full story, unvarnished and unspun.  But all we see on TV are
retired military officers and Administration officials
narrating a clean and precise war that bears little resemblance
to the chaos, bloodshed, and tragedy on the ground.

We need to demand the full picture.  Please consider joining
the MoveOn Media Corps right now.  The action ideas we send
you won't generally take longer than 15 minutes, but to be
part of the Corps we ask that you commit to taking up to one
action per day.  The actions could include calling media
outlets when they air especially bad coverage, pushing Clear
Channel radio to stop censoring anti-war songs, or writing
letters to the editor.

you only consume oil if you own a car?

is this for real?  wow!  so, do you ONLY eat vegetables grown in your local region?  i mean, even THOSE are driven at some point to your grocer's stand/store/whatever.  of course, the more food you eat from FAR OFF locations, the MORE OIL it will take to get the food to you.  thus one of the many sections of the pie of macrobiotics (macro=big, biotics=life, and ALL that encompasses bodies/spirits/minds).

but all Americans are complicit in the consumption of oil.  to think that you ONLY have to own a car to be a consumer of oil is really just a form of NOT thinking.

the list is endless, let's NOT just stick with vegetables.  there's probably no other country as guilty as we are.  and we are, all of us, guilty.  even those who STRIVE to make their homes and lives and families as independent as possible from the consumption of such things which require oil.  it's virtually IMPOSSIBLE to live an oil-free existence in our world as we know it, unless you're living in the woods eating food you find and making clothes from things you find, etc.

the fact that you have or borrow a computer to send your posts to this list is enough evidence that you consume oil in one fashion or another.  we're all guilty, but we can educate ourselves as best we can to recycle and CUT back on the consumption of oil and the many other things which consume oil for manufacturing and/or import/export.  every time we don't recycle a bottle, the oil used in the machinery to make another, and the oil used in shipping it.  BUT EVEN IF YOU DO RECYCLE IT, the oil used to gather it in the trucks, and the oil used in the machinery to recycle it's glass!  it's just nuts when you start on it!

>Dear Michael Helsem & Masha Zavialova,
>What can we do ? -

there is not just one thing for everyone (for example,
i have almost no available money for charity-type
things). but i experience this war in two ways: as
a poet, & as a citizen (albeit an unwilling one, at
times). as a citizen i can, of course, attempt to vote
in 2004 (in a state where my vote will almost certainly
be thrown out--); i can join the modest demonstrations
in this town (on my days off); perhaps i can write in
to the monopoly-conservative newspaper here (which will
not even acknowledge it)... as a poet, i can refuse to
shut my eyes to what is being done elsewhere (& not only
what is being done in my name as a citizen of America, but
as a citizen of the world--); possibly something good will
be written, possibly not. but on the other hand, it is doing
much to avoid getting caught up in groupthink & war hysteria--
& to counsel others to do the same. regardless of our ignorance
of history as a populace, this situation is hardly unprecedented.
nor is it an occasion to discard civility, simply because our
media input out-blares any possible back-talk.

i tried to find an essay online "On not being banned by the Nazis"

URBAN POETRY/SPOKEN WORD
Organized and hosted by Catherine Daly, this exploration of new genres
brings together a wide range of performance, multi-media experiences,
and music.

Friday, April 4, 7pm
WENDY KRAMER

Wendy Kramer's stunning image collages are poems. Visually, they are
"songs without words"; each time they are read or performed, they
change.  Whether the collages are read on page or screen by ordinary
readers and audience members, or by the poet herself in this premiere LA
multi-media performance, the effect is fresh and new.

Shirley helped Jane hobble back to the safety of the Holy Valley. As the
gates to the valley drew shut, they could hear the rattle of the serpents as
the heavens fired upon the evil enemy.

Once inside the valley, Jane noticed that Shirley was hemmorhaging divine
effluvient from her arm. Jane cut open Shirley's karmic garment arm to
reveal a gaping flesh wound on her forearm, on the obverse side, just below
the elbow's radian. Shirley sustained neuronal damage, as well as a
shattered finger, all from the pointed flight of serpent teeth.

Shirley then looked at her friend's tormented foot, concluding that the
torment too was more serious than first thought. A piece of Jane's right
heel had been excised prematurely through the force of the flying serpent
teeth, exposing the tender innards of ligamental networks and pulsing
vasculature.  Her wound was glistening and unfortunate.  The wizard said
Jane would not lose her foot to the vagaries of tormented existence, but
would require one year of repentance and forgiveness in order to restore its
proper use.

How Dyer sees the war:
He wrote his corrective to the hawks' books on Iraq in less than a month

IGNORANT ARMIES: Sliding into War with Iraq

By Gwynne Dyer

McClelland & Stewart 189 pages ($19.99)

Well-known to Canadians as a broadcast journalist and syndicated
columnist on international affairs, Gwynne Dyer is a naval veteran
who has taught history and war studies at military colleges.

His new book, Ignorant Armies, is an ambitious, far-ranging
examination of the American-led war on Iraq. Could anything be more
timely? He offers predictions for the war's outcome and explains how
it developed out of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks on the United
States.

Dyer keeps tightly focused on the political strategies of the key
players: the U.S., Iraq, Israel and al-Qaida. He also evaluates
whether this war will achieve its intended goals.

In the introduction, he reminds readers that he supports some wars.
For example, he supported the 1991 Gulf War to get Iraq to leave
Kuwait. Later he argues that the 2001 war on Afghanistan effectively
dismantled terrorist training camps while benefiting from a high
level of international support.

But he has serious doubts about the new war on Iraq, and these set
him apart from former Central Intelligence Agency analyst Kenneth
Pollack and other, more hawkish writers. It was Pollack's book, The
Threatening Storm: The Case for Invading Iraq, that convinced many
members of the U.S. Congress that war was the only option left for
dealing with Baghdad.

Dyer gives a range of forecasts for the conflict's outcome.

The mildest scenario -- "war will be over in a week" -- is a wild
fantasy of civilian hawks like U.S. Secretary of Defence Donald
Rumsfeld, he says. In this "war lite" version, there is no
street-fighting and the Americans are hailed as liberating heroes.
Dyer jokes that Rumsfeld will have enough time left over to pick up
his drycleaning and buy a birthday present for Condi Rice.

Of course, Rumsfeld could be right, after all. U.S. military
technology is now so overwhelmingly superior, it can kill up to 100
Iraqi soldiers for every American lost, numbers which argue in favour
of a quick victory.

He then describes the many ways this war could go wrong. The disaster
scenario includes blown-up oil fields, intense street-fighting, high
military and civilian casualties, Iraqi use of chemical or biological
weapons, and a U.S. nuclear response. Israel is the most dangerous
wild card, either entering the war or taking more aggressive action
towards the Palestinians.

Whatever happens in Iraq itself, Dyer argues convincingly that the
war's worst fallout will be to strengthen Islamist movements in Arab
countries with repressive regimes and ties to the U.S. He says states
like Jordan, Algeria and Egypt are ripe for an Iranian-style
revolution. The same potential exists in Pakistan, a nuclear power.
Any of these could become a haven for terrorist groups.

While more hawkish analysts, like Pollack, argue that Iraq's weapons
programs justify the war, Dyer states that their remnants did not
pose a real threat to world security.

In his discussion of chemical weapons, he tells a different version
of President George W. Bush's story that Saddam "gassed his own
people" in 1988. To him, the incident as being more akin to "friendly
fire": When Iraqi soldiers fired on Halabja, they believed the city
was still occupied by Iranian forces, not the Kurdish townspeople who
had just returned.

On Iraq's nuclear program, Dyer argues that President Saddam Hussein
is not a rotten cartoon villain, like the Joker in Batman, but a
real-world political actor. He wanted nuclear weapons to balance
Israel's regional monopoly and become a hero in the Arab world.

The other American justification for war is Iraq's supposed link with
al-Qaida, the terrorist network responsible for Sept. 11. Says Dyer:
"There is absolutely no evidence that any of the alleged members of
the 'axis of evil' (Iraq, Iran and North Korea) had anything to do
with those attacks." A roll call of al-Qaida recruits in the
terrorist training camps of Afghanistan reveals that only two per
cent were Iraqi -- less than the combined number of British and
American citizens.

Dyer also says that Osama bin Laden is not a "senseless" terrorist,
but rather a strategist who wants to bring Islamist governments to
power in the Arab world. A major motive behind Sept. 11 was to
provoke the U.S. into lashing back blindly, killing innocent Muslims
and thus winning new converts to terrorism.

Dyer argues that while the Bush administration largely avoided
blundering into this trap in Afghanistan, it has done so now. In his
view, it's fair to say that Rumsfeld is "moonlighting as the director
of recruitment for al-Qaida."

Dyer further argues that Bush talked up the war partly to keep his
popularity high after Sept. 11 and to win the November 2002 midterm
elections. But as time went on, the war gathered its own momentum.

In his final remarks, Dyer admits to having written Ignorant Armies
in three-and-a-half weeks, "on the road half the time (and only awake
some of the time)." Although his lines of thought do jump around at
times, he brings a lifetime of experience to help take the spin out
of spin doctors' speeches.

To understand what's really happening in Iraq, most of us could
switch off the news and read Ignorant Armies instead.

ARIELLE GREENBERG AND JOHANNES G=D4RANSSON
Arielle Greenberg's first book, Given, was released in November 2002 from
Verse Press. Her poems have appeared or are forthcoming in journals such as
the Denver Quarterly, Web Conjunctions, New American Writing, Crayon, Both,
Fence, Crowd, Jubilat and others. She is on the editorial advisory board of
How2, and frequently reviews books for Rain Taxi, The Electronic Poetry
Review and elsewhere. She recently spoke on her theory of an emerging
contemporary feminist/feminine experimental poetry aesthetic, the Gurlesque=
,
at Small Press Traffic in San Francisco. Laura Mullen notes that "tight
phrasings and a gorgeous, wild precision of images make Greenberg's writing=

Masha, Chris, and Igor and anyone else following this.

I'd be interested in Chekov and Trotsky on this.  I know T has a book on
this topic bu as I recall it was basically red propaganda he called for even
though he may have had an appreciation for poetry?

I've just picked up Langer's _Regarding the pain of Others which seems
relevant here?

byte #1 The book opens with her discussion of V. Wool's _Three Guineas which
is an answer to a question from a man, "How in your opinion are _we to
prevent war.'  This as she poits out is not the same as asking 'What are
_your thoughts about preventing war?' These are two fundamentally different
questions and it is the _we here that is crucial in understanding VW's
writing a reply to an emminent male lawyer of the time.

Stay tuned as I am reading this closely

Rilke through Gabriel Marcel: "We drift between Christ, the two Maries and
the Saints. We are lost among forms and voices. We are deceived over and
over again by this half-familiar element which causes neither surprise nor
fear and does not tear us from our everyday outlook. We get accustomed to
this, but there can be no getting accustomed to finding God."

Foucault on Binswanger: "It is important that the image possesses its own
dynamic powers, that there is a different morphology of space when it is
free, luminous space and when the space put into play is imprisoning,
dark, and stifling. The imaginary world has its own laws, its specific
structures, and the image is somewhat more than the immediate fulfillment
of meaning. It has its own density, and the laws which govern it are not
solely significant propositions, just as the laws of the world are not
simply decress of will, even a divine will. Freud caused the world of the
imaginary to be inhabited by Desire as classical metaphysics caused the
world of physics to be inhabited by Divine Will and Understanding: a
theology of meanings, in which the truth anticipates its own formulations
and completely constitutes them. The meanings exhaust the reality of the
world which displays that reality."

Chekhov firmly says that "an artist can reveal the human condition , not
directly alleviate it."  He was appalled personally by inequity, injustice,
indentured servitude after the serfs were free, corruption, laziness and
decadence of the upper classes, etc.  But he never, so far as his biographies
reccount, took a "political" stance publically.  He certainly must have more
than sensed the revolution on its way--he died in 1904 and there was plenty
going on in the streets.  Something marvelous occurs in his very last
writing, "The Betrothed."  Check it out.  It's proto-feminist.  The girl
leaves the boy and goes off to, gasp, college.

Sanctity like mortar fire slakes the burning thirsts for asimple Jesus
preached without uncomfortable questions. Scarcely understanding we would
actually like to push into the hereafter and ask questions of the
unfortunate parts of the Gospel. St. Francis with Brother Bernardo told the
German armies that they should throw their jewels into the river to see new
colors they were stepped on. Reflection began in early spring with a hard
Lenten Penance.

The Bible that they produce has gold leafed pages, a velvet bookmark and a

general construction by armies of  twelve companions, all lovers, who threw
stones and mud at the fortifications. Fighting gives value to fists;
crushing the bones of his face like toffee pieces in soft ice cream.

Stalingrad is forgotten as I expected; the companions of St Francis were
exposed to cold and snow. By September they should elect a great General who
knows God personally . The  Second Army received six brand-new tanks for
pacification. Through early summer personnel in the Word of Truth ask
questions that are not answered. Nothing touched upon the lips. The forces
of time along with Army Group B's burning guns left you in the heat,
sweating.

Prince Pearl, a chief serpent of the war on Hope Valley, resigned yesterday
as chairman of the feared Fang Panel following allegations that he faced a
serious conflict of interest.

Pearl, nicknamed the Prince of Darkness, has long been one of the leading
serpents of the Fang Panel advising the Serpent King to wreak wounds and
cause bloodshed in the valley. He has argued that it represented a new place
to nest.

Pearl has said that any profits he made from his new nest would be given to
relatives of serpents slain in the valley. In his resignation, he said that
he could no longer fly over the valley. Leading serpents replied by
describing Pearl as "a man of integrity, magesty and finely-sharpened

Bob,

You may feel that you don't have enough information to comment on the
situation in Iraq.

In the 1960s, many people did feel that way. But when the NY Times
published the Pentagon Papers -- and later the Post & others followed
with all of the transcripts of the Watergate tapes -- it rapidly became
clear that the difference in information between the Oval Office & the
corner of Bowery & Houston was not so very great at all. And most of the
difference between one and the other was a web of lies emanating from
the Oval Office.

The sad reality of this whole mess is that Rummy & Cheney & George Dub
don't know very much more about this than you or I -- and look how
they're behaving.

Ron

                             there is not just one
thing for everyone (for example,
                             i have almost no
available money for charity-type
                             things). but i experience
this war in two ways: as
                             a poet, & as a citizen
(albeit an unwilling one, at
                             times). as a citizen i
can, of course, attempt to vote
                             in 2004 (in a state where
my vote will almost certainly
                             be thrown out--); i can
join the modest demonstrations
                             in this town (on my days
off); perhaps i can write in
                             to the
monopoly-conservative newspaper here (which will
                             not even acknowledge
it)... as a poet, i can refuse to
                             shut my eyes to what is
being done elsewhere (& not only
                             what is being done in my
name as a citizen of America, but
                             as a citizen of the
world--); possibly something good will
                             be written, possibly not.
but on the other hand, it is doing
                             much to avoid getting
caught up in groupthink & war hysteria--
                             & to counsel others to do
the same. regardless of our ignorance
                             of history as a populace,
this situation is hardly unprecedented.
                             nor is it an occasion to
discard civility, simply because our
                             media input out-blares
any possible back-talk.

Miss Dynamite: New Painting, Susan Bee's third solo show at A.I.R. Gallery,
opens April 1st and runs until April 26th. This show includes Arabesque, a
painting done in response to September 11th; Sign Under Test, which
includes poems by Charles Bernstein; and Weird Tales, which features scenes
from vintage science fiction, as well as other paintings. "Susan Bee plucks
the ordinary and aberrant from pulp fiction, film noir and other genres,
linking them together through the use of bold, dominant hues, Mondrian-like
structure, and highly stylized biological forms," according to Dan Younger,
curator of the Olin Art Gallery, Kenyon College. "Bee's disrupted, profane,
and dysfunctional elements appear in her orbit-like compositions like
riddled, zodiacal maps that can be read as well as seen." Her work is a
"triumph of contradiction," as Thomas McEvilley noted in Art in America.

TALAN MEMMOTT is an award-winning new media artist and editor of the online
journal Beehive, formerly based in San Francisco. He is currently at Brown
University as their first electronic writing graduate fellow. In 2001 he
was awarded the trAce/Alt-X New Media Writing Award for his work Lexia to
Perplexia, which also received honorable mention for the Electronic
Literature Organization's award in fiction. He is a tutor for the trAce
Online Writing School, and has been a speaker, panelist, reader and
performer at various conferences and universities. Lexia to Perplexia has
been discussed in essays by Katherine Hayles, Barrett Watten, Brian Reed,
and others; Shirley Jackson (author of Patchwork Girl) has commented:
The wide black screen of Talan Memmott's stunning, difficult Lexia to
Perplexia is a kind of theater in which luminous symbols and sentences
(which look more like formulae) come and go. At times the lucid graphic
icons are more readable than the layered scrims of text. Is this still
writing? Certainly, the reader's first pleasure will probably be a visual
one. This is a gorgeous piece. But the visuals though beautiful are not
only decorative but syntactical. Some of Memmott's most elegant arguments
are made visually, through the logic of layout and the grammar of the link.
While in much new media writing it is possible to consider the design and
the "content" separately (sadly, it is usually the content that comes up
short), this piece calls such distinctions into question. It is impossible
to decide where design ends and the text proper begins. This improper text
is as much made up of buried coding and spatial logic as it is of ordinary
English words. In fact such words as it contains are neither ordinary nor
exactly English anymore. A new media writer has to be good at writing code
as well as sentences. Reflecting on this, Memmott borrows as much from the
conventions of html code as from the not much less difficult codes of
Deleuzian theory, metamorphosing them into a jammed, fractured diction full
of slashes, dots and brackets. There is a purpose to this besides play,
since the piece is about the code-mediated relationship between the reader,
the (electronic) text, and the author. This sounds like postmodern critical
theory, and it is, but one could also call it fiction, because it not only
analyzes but dramatizes a relationship. However, since it involves the
reader in creating that very relationship, it is maybe not so much a
fiction as a fact: a performance or even a happening, in the theatrical
sense. What you-the-reader do IS the text.

For Immediate Release
March 28, 2003
Turbulence Artists’ Studio: Lewis LaCook
http://turbulence.org/studios/lacook/index.html

Two ideas fascinate LaCook: chance operations and active user collaboration. The “stable” artwork , he says, can just as easily appear in another format, such as a book, a gallery space, or on a cinema screen. The computer works via variables and loops and, well, VARIES.

LaCook uses the machine's native ability to generate pseudo-random numbers, and to make decisions based on those numbers. In his work, either the text, music or graphic elements are generated this way. While some elements in his works do remain stable, others always vary. A user's collaboration may take the form of simply opening the piece (whereby some of the afore-mentioned aleatoric processes may become a factor), or by having a direct hand in the work's manifestation.

BIOGRAPHY

Lewis LaCook is a poet who wandered one day into a “gorgeously chaotic, polylogical room. He's been there ever since.” Born in Lorain, Ohio on November 5, 1970, he began writing poetry in his early teens, shortly after the death of his father. At sixteen, Black River Review first published his work; subsequently, small press journals like Whiskey Island, the Coventry Reader, and Lost and Found Times published his poetry. Anabasis press published his long poem “Cling” as a chapbook in 2000.

In the mid-to-late nineties, while attending Kent State University LaCook developed a passion for music, and played in several bands. In the late nineties he discovered the Internet, and was immediately struck by how easily he might combine his passions for music and poetry. As LaCook's use of the Internet increased, his focus began to shift from using the medium as a multimedia and distributive tool to exploring it for its own sake. His early works in this genre met with some success; Rhizome.org began accepting his works into their artBase in 2002, and online venues like CTheory Multimedia, Cauldron and Net, Artifacts at Web Del Sol, 3rd Bed and Slope presented his works on their web sites.

This document, entitled "WOULD AN INVASION OF IRAQ BE A 'JUST WAR,'" was
found at the US Institute of Peace website. USIP is a Washington-based
think tank devoted to peace studies. This report was compiled from a
symposium held 17 December 2002. Its main points clearly bulleted at front
of report. The symposium speakers are all "experts" of classic christian
just war theory, as outlined mainly by  Ambrose, Augustine,and later
Aquinas. Freaky read.

brings about peace; only peace brings about peace." --Susan Brooks

Iraq War Will Divide=20
The World for the Better

Which side are you on? Which side are you on?
-- Old union song.

Togetherness is oversold. Especially by politicians and statesmen, who =
sometimes hide their courage under the teacup of compromise and =
multilateralism. But there are times when all of us have to decide which =
side we are going to be on, not for an evening's argument but for the =
long haul. The Iraq war is one of those moments.

By the time this war ends, it will have divided national leaders, =
divided the world's voters and yes, divided the world's press. That is =
to say, the institutions that set the world on its course. We will know =
pretty soon where that world is headed, and who will be its pilots.

There is a tradition in the U.S. that once the President puts troops =
into action we "unite" to support our men and women, as Democrats such =
as John Kerry and John Edwards have now done. But that's easy. A larger =
choice is being asked of everyone by this war waged against the regime =
of Saddam Hussein.

Here a few days ago, Spain's Foreign Minister Ana Palacio aligned =
herself with "the values and objectives we share with the United States" =
and in support quoted Miguel Cervantes on liberty. Liberty, Cervantes =
said, is "one of the most precious gifts heaven has bestowed upon Man. =
No treasures the earth contains or the sea conceals can be compared to =
it. For liberty one can rightfully risk one's life." We are finding out =
right now who agrees with that.

Yesterday Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak decided against: "Egypt won't =
offer any assistance of any kind against any Arab country." So too =
Russia's Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov, who says the war "is not about =
the democratization of Iraq. It's about the total destruction of the =
country."

Last Sunday, former Canadian prime minister Brian Mulroney made his =
decision: "For 135 years, Canada has made common cause with Australia, =
the United Kingdom and the United States in the defense of liberty and =
freedom around the world. Now we have repudiated at a crucial moment in =
our history...."

Even in France you can find an inkling that not all its citizens stand =
with Messrs. Chirac and De Villepin. In the final sentence of an obscure =
New York Times report on Bordeaux, one finds this from Corinne =
Mentzelopoulos, the owner of Chateau Margaux: "America saved us in two =
world wars and from communism," she said. "I haven't forgotten that." I =
think Ms. Mentzelopoulos understands, in a way now lost to the Chiracs, =
de Villepins and perhaps never known to the Putins and Mubaraks, what =
Cervantes was saying about why liberty is the dearest of political =
values. A similar understanding has already been discovered in the =
nations east of Germany.

On MSNBC Keith Olbermann asked the parents of James Kiehl, a captured GI =
in Iraq, if they felt "victimized." His stepmother replied, "No, James =
was there to fight terror and to protect his family." Mrs. Kiehl has =
also made a decision, different than that of the people who laid down on =
Fifth Avenue in New York yesterday in what they called a "die-in for =
peace." But they aren't close to dying. I see no reason why Army =
Specialist Kiehl's parents in Comfort, Texas, should sit down with the =
protesters in New York or San Francisco to find common ground. There is =
none.

The divisions in the media are not so clear cut. Some of their =
colleagues are criticizing the work of the embedded reporters in Iraq. =
They say the embeds can't provide "perspective" or the "larger picture." =
For some years now, the standard model of journalism has been that =
reporters don't just offer facts but must include their analysis of the =
facts. The assumption here is that mere facts lack sufficiency and that =
an explained or analyzed fact moves us closer to reality or truth.

When this began, some stories were labeled "Analysis," and it was a =
useful tool for adding context if needed. But now no one bothers because =
it's almost all analysis. This model is so internalized that I believe =
some of the critics are coming very close to suggesting that what the =
embeds with U.S. troops on the Iraqi front are reporting does not =
constitute reality. Reality in journalism cannot exist until it is =
processed through a reporter's filter of analysis.

This may be a difficult model to sustain now, at least on television. =
The TV people stateside are clearly quite proud of what their reporters =
are doing. The frontline reporters who survive this war will occupy a =
unique status inside their organizations. Some media executives may =
decide that this straight reporting is where their strength lies. It =
looks like there's an audience for it.

It is one thing for reporters to say they don't take sides, even in war, =
or especially in war. But sometimes they seem to suggest that no one =
should ever be able to decide whose side they're on. This war is a =
killer of equivocation.

A few nights ago, during that high sandstorm, an embedded TV reporter =
stood over a soldier who was lying on his stomach, exposed to the wind =
and grit, holding his rifle and staring through goggles into nothing. =
The reporter said, "What do you think of being here in conditions like =
this." The soldier said: "I love it, sir. I truly do. I wouldn't want to =
be anywhere else right now."

Which side are you on? Some surely will recoil at the suggestion that we =
should so simply reduce the politics of this war. But the war against =
Saddam Hussein is a rare, defining event, as Vietnam was. It is going to =
establish divisions for a generation -- in relations among nations, in =
voting patterns. Long-term claims to moral standing are at stake. Among =
families and friends, these matters in time will never come up again, =
but like villagers in occupied France, no one's ever going to forget =
either.

These are not the destructive divisions so often worried over by =
instinctive moderates and multilateralists. These are constructive =
divisions, which are driving the world's people toward making a decision =
about what they believe in, why they believe it and what kind of world =
they want to live in.

Subject:      need a John Cage quote
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="iso-8859-1"
Content-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable

I am looking for a John Cage quote, which I believe I saw in a book by =
Marjorie Perloff a long time ago. I think it's the book where Perloff =
discusses Cage's mesostic verse and his piece for James Joyce (with with =
pulled out of Finnegans Wake). And I think it mentions that when John =
Cage read at Harvard, the audience was perplexed by his work and someone =
asked him why he wrote the way he did, and Cage replied "Out of a strong =
compulsion to make it so"--or some such thing, though I may have =
confused a few of the details. I no longer have access to the book. =
Perhaps someone could please help find the exact quote (both the =
question and the answer)? I'd be hugely grateful!

Yes, indeed, Sir Hilton, brave defender of the valley.  Pearl will now be
allowed to sink his teeth into his interest, conflict-free, and sink into
the darkness.  Unless the serpents are taunted by him as a reminder of their
guilty states of mind, that is.  If that becomes the situation, his fellow
serpents will have to take away his eggs.

It is good he has moved away form the light, for in nestling his coil into a
corner of the darkness, he remains far away from the valley.

Three jeers for the Prince!  Ooogra!  Ooogra!  Ooogra!  Three cheers for the
valley!  Hoorah!  Hoorah!  Hoorah!

Above the world-weary horizons
New obstacles for exchange arise
Or unfold,
O ye postmasters!

1. About the Poetics List

With the preceding epigraph, the Poetics Listserv was founded by Charles
Bernstein in late 1993. Now in its third incarnation, the list carries
about 1000 subscribers worldwide, though all of these subscribers do not
necessarily receive messages at any given time. A good number of other
people read the Poetics List via our web archives (see web-address above).

Our aim is to support, inform, and extend those directions in poetry that
are committed to innovations, renovations, and investigations of form
and/or/as content, to the questioning of received forms and styles, and to
the creation of the otherwise unimagined, untried, unexpected, improbable,
and impossible.  We recognize that other lists may sponsor other
possibilities for exchange in this still-new medium. We request that those
participating in this forum keep in mind the specialized and focused nature
of this project, and respect our decision to operate a moderated list. For
subscription information or to contact the moderators, write to
<poetics@acsu.buffalo.edu>.

This is a private list and information about this list should not be posted
to other lists or directories of lists. The idea is to keep the list
membership to those with specific rather than general interests, and also
to keep the scale of the list relatively small and the volume manageable.
The current limits of the list are 50 messages per day, and two messages
per subscriber per day.

The Poetics List is a moderated list. Due to the high number of
subscribers, we no longer maintain the open format with which the list
began (at under 100 subscribers). The specific form of moderation that we
employ is a relatively fluid one: in most cases, messages are reviewed
after having been posted to the list, and difficulties resolved on that
basis; however, the list moderators may shift with impunity between this
and a pre-review mode which calls for all messages to be read and approved
before being forwarded to the list. We prefer to avoid this option, as it
hampers the spontaneity of discussion that we hope to promote. In addition
to these options, the list moderators may place subscribers who find
themselves unable to abide by the rules of the list under individual
review, in which case only their messages would be received for moderators'
approval before being forwarded to the list. We remain committed to this
editorial function as a defining element of the Poetics List (for further
information please see section 6 of this Welcome Message).

Those few individuals who are no longer welcome to post on this list have
forfeited that right because of their refusal to abide by list policies as
stated in this Welcome message. While we adhere to a practice of not
discussing particular cases on the list, the areas of our greatest concern
include flaming of other list subscribers, including the list owners,
and/or giving us false registration information. Please note some
individuals have publicized false accounts of the policies of the Poetics
List. We have deemed it unwise to respond directly to the flames of the
list, preferring simply to note here that the Poetics List exists to
support and encourage divergent points of view on Modern and contemporary
poetry and poetics. We are committed to do what is necessary to preserve
this space for such dialog. For this reason, the list has always been
private or moderated.

Further information on posting to the list for subscribers, publishers and
series-coordinators, see sections 5 and 6.

In addition to being archived at through the EPC at http://epc.buffalo.edu)
and at http://listserv.acsu.buffalo.edu/archives/poetics.html, some posts
to Poetics (especially reviews, obituary notices, announcements, etc.) may
also become part of specific EPC subject areas. Brief reviews of poetry
events and publications are always welcome; we also encourage posts that
announce events important to our subscribers. See section 5 for details.

----------------

2. Subscriptions

Subscriptions to the Poetics List are free of charge, but formal
registration is required. We ask that when you subscribe you provide your
full name, street address, email address, and telephone number. All posts
to the list should provide your full real name, as registered. If there is
any discrepancy between your full name as it appears in the "from" line of
the message header, please sign your post at the bottom.  All
subscription-related information and correspondence remains absolutely
confidential.

To subscribe to the Poetics List, please contact the moderators at the
lists' administrative address <poetics@acsu.buffalo.edu>. Your message
should include all of the required information. All other questions about
subscriptions, whether about an individual subscription or subscription
policy, should be addressed to this same administrative address.

PLEASE NOTE: IT MAY TAKE SEVERAL WEEKS TO PROCESS SUBSCRIPTION REQUESTS.

The most frequent problem with subscriptions is bounced messages. If your
system is often down or if you have a low disk quota, Poetics messages may
get bounced. Please try avoid having messages from the list returned to us.
If the problem is low disk quota, you may wish to request an increased
quota from your system administrator.  You might also consider obtaining a
commercial account. In general, if a good number of Poetics messages are
bounced from your account, your subscription to Poetics will be temporarily
suspended. If this happens, you may re-subscribe to the list by contacting
the moderators at<poetics@acsu.buffalo.edu>.

-----------------

3. Subscription Options

We encourage you to alter your subscription options via the link on the
right side of the screen at
http://listserv.acsu.buffalo.edu/archives/poetics.html.  If you would
prefer not to use the web-interface, you may also email

*to receive posts in the default option (you will receive individual
postings immediately), send <listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu> this one-line
message with no "subject": set poetics nodigest

* to receive the list in digest form (you will receive the day's individual
posts in one email sent just after midnight EST), send
<listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu> this one-line message with no "subject":
set poetics digest

List. To avoid this problem, unsub using your old address, then return to
your new address and contact the moderators at <poetics@acsu.buffalo.edu>

--------------------------

5.  Posting to the List

The Poetics List is a moderated list. All messages are reviewed by the
moderators in keeping with the goals of the list as articulated in this
Welcome Message (see section 1).

While this list is primarily concerned with discussions of poetry and
poetics, messages relating to politics and political activism, film, art,
media, and so forth are also welcome. Feel free to query the list
moderators if you are uncertain as to whether a message is appropriate. All
correspondence with the moderators regarding submissions to the list
remains confidential and should be directed to us at
<poetics@acsu.buffalo.edu>.

We strongly encourage subscribers to post information on publications and
reading series that they have coordinated, edited, published, or in which
they appear. Such announcements constitute a core function of this list.
Brief reviews of poetry events and publications are always welcome.

To post to the Poetics List, send your messages directly
to the list address: <poetics@listserv.buffalo.edu>

Please do not send messages intended for posting to the list to our
administrative address <poetics@acsu.buffalo.edu>

For further information on posting to the list, see section 6 below.

-------------------

6. Cautions

"Flame" messages will not be tolerated on the Poetics List. In this
category are included messages gratuitously attacking fellow listees or the
list owners, also messages designed to "waste bandwidth" or cause the list
to reach its daily limit. These messages are considered offensive and
detrimental to list discussion. Offending subscribers will be placed on
temporary review (see section 1). Repeat offenders will be removed from the
list immediately. Please do not put this policy to test.

For reasons of basic security, we do not allow pseudononymous
subscriptions.  We also discourage the sending of HTML-formatted messages
to the list. All messages intended for the Poetics List should be sent in
Text-Only format.

Please also do not send attachments or include extremely long documents
(1,000+ words) in a post.  Messages containing attachments will be presumed
to be worm- or virus-carrying and will not be forwarded to the list.

Please do not publish list postings without the express permission of the
author. Posting on the list is a form of publication. Copyright for all
material posted on Poetics remains with the author; material from this list
and its archive may not be reproduced without the author's permission,
beyond the standard rights accorded by "fair use" of published materials.

As an outside maximum, we will accept no more than 2 messages per day from
any one subscriber. Also, given that our goal is a manageable list
(manageable both for moderators and subscribers), the list accepts 50 or
fewer messages per day.

Like all systems, the listserv will sometimes be down: if you feel your
message has been delayed or lost, *please wait at least one day to see if
it shows up*, then check the archive to be sure the message is not posted
there; if you still feel there is a problem, you may wish to contact the
moderators at <poetics@acsu.buffalo.edu>.

MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=ISO-8859-1

In a 1953 letter to J.F. Powers, Roethke mentions a New York reading he
performed "with a five piece band behind me in which, so help me, I 'sang'
several songs,--settings of 'children's' poems."

I can't find any record of where he read, which specific poems he performed,
the style in which he 'sang,' or the nature of the five piece band (jazz
combo?). I was wondering if anyone happens to have ancedotal or archival
information on this reading.

Please respond off-list.

Thanks,
Joseph

I have a hard time believing that Americans are criticizing the "fact-based" war reporting because we're so used to analysis on the news. This is laughable.

What is being called analysis in the mainstream media is simply filler for 24-hour news stations, pundit-go-rounds during the Target Iraq, Countdown for Saddam or Countdown to Freedom segments of the Cable News show.

Before the war, the "analysis" was curiously devoid of critical questions like:

Wasn't 9-11 a result of aiding "freedom fighters", then cutting & running (by the present cast of characters)?

If the USA isn't going to cut & run this time, how long will the Occupation stay & pay?

What should the Arab world's response to a US invasion, given this administration's refusal to honestly engage in the region's most glaring regional conflict(Israel/Palestine)?

With the American Mideast track record, why should Arabs (Iraqi or otherwise)trust the USA?

What are the long-term effects of taking on the world alone?

How does occupation effect the War on Terror?

Who will the USA support to rule the new Iraq? (They're not sure, or they won't tell.)

How does this reflect on the American promise of regional democracy?

What are the possibilities of an ongoing civil war in Iraq without an American iron fist?

What will that iron fist cost in dollars & civil liberties?

Analysis? Where are you?

The more Secretary of War, Donald Rumsfeld, Cheney and Wolfilitz develop th=

language and strategies around their poetry of "preemptive attacks", like
most of us, I assume, I both resist and shutter at the implications of the
word and concept of "preemption." The word, as used by Rumsfeld & Co. seems
to painfully resonate with an old phrase for a deeply familiar strategy of
conquest, land seizure, exploitation of "native" owned resources and/or
genocide.=20
Well, sure enough, in a little bit of recent research on European
mid-nineteenth century settlers in the Mattole River and Lost Coast region
of Northern California (frequently and legitimately described as a
"paradise" by nineteenth century visitors), I discovered what was called th=

"Preemption Act" which was a statute passed (1841) by the U.S. Congress in
response to the demands of the Western states that squatters be allowed to
preempt lands. Pioneers often settled on public lands before they could be
surveyed and auctioned by the U.S. government. At first the squatter claims
were not recognized, but in 1830 the first of a series of temporary
preemption laws was passed by Congress... After the passage (1862) of the
Homestead Act, the value of preemption for bona fide settlers declined, and
the practice more and more became a tool for speculators. Congress repealed
the Preemption Act in 1891. (The Columbia Encyclopedia, Fifth Edition
Copyright =A91994, 1995 Columbia University Press.)

The Mattole tribe of about 2000 was 95% destroyed by 1865 - the first white
settlers arrived in 1852. "Premption" proved a mix of squatting on tribal
land which starved the Indians which initiated hostilities, murders and war=
.
The familiar western story.

"Preemption" as initiated with "Preemptive Attacks" - whether they be on
Iraq, Iran, Syria, etc - remains clearly alive as an "activist" phrase and
"tool for speculators"  -    aka reconstruction contracts, oil
redistribution, etc., etc.  Western "Manifest Destiny" now redefined as
"Global" -=20


Iraq etc. - gives those of us who are the descendants - or most of us who
are at least beneficiaries -  of the conquest of those original
Euro-American settlers - the "strategic opportunity" again to revisit and
"target" and "re-shape" the logics of conquest, such as this current one.
Does anyone else sense the magnitude and power - if not tyranny - of the
current Bush & Co. leadership is sewing the seeds of a fresh civil war?
Current radar suggests the possibility - but now the players and terrain ar=
e
international. Instead of an exclusively national one, we appear to be
looking at a global civil war with political agendas of multiple players
(from theocratic to what have "we"). The freedom of  "Emancipation" of who
and what - and with who's leadership - certainly opens a pod for fresh
definitions - presuming "cooler heads prevail" and the globe is not dusted
with nuclear stuff!!

Nationally, One disturbing view of the current quagmire in Iraq is that the
Bush folks will purposely sustain the conflict into the next election on th=
e
supposition that the Public will not throw them out in the middle of a war.
If Iraq is "out of the picture", one assumes they will make another
aggressive geo-move, etc.

Against the Grim,

I just forwarded this. Frankly, I don't think the news we get is
"fact-based"--I don't even know what this means!-- or ever had any real
analysis. But some of the philosophical points in this piece I think are
interesting.  The war is, however, providing many retired military officers
with a good second income as consultants on news programs. Of course it's
just another war game to them. Like checkers.

$6/ $4 students and seniors/ Free to members.

John Ashbery was born in Rochester, New York in 1927.  Best known as a poet,
he has published more than 20 collections beginning in 1953 with Turadot and
Other Poems.  In 1975 his Self-Portrait in a Convex Mirror was awarded the
Pulitzer Prize, National Book Award and the National Book Critics Award.
His
most recent volumes (1998-2002) are Wakefulness, Girls on the Run, Your Name
Here, As Umbrellas Follow Rain, and Chinese Whispers.

He is also well known for his writings on art, which began in 1957.  He
served as executive editor of Art News, and was art critic for New York
Magazine and Newsweek.  A selection of his art writings, Reported Sightings:
Art Chronicles 1957-1987, was published in 1989.  His further forays in
literary genres include the novel A Nest of Ninnies with James Schulyer, as
well as his collection, Three Plays.  A noted translator, Ashbery has
published numerous translations from the French including work by Artaud,
Raymond Roussel, Max Jacob and Peter Martory.  A selection of his prose
pieces is forthcoming from the University of Michigan Press.  His own work
has been translated into more than twenty languages.

Ashbery has held many prestigious academic positions including Distinguished

Stevenson, Jr. Professor of Languages and Literature at Bard College in
Annandale-on-Hudson, New York.

His list of awards, grants and memberships in academic academies are so
numerous it has been said that he is a poet for whom new awards must be
created.  A few of the innumerable prizes and honors awarded to him over the
years include the Wallace Stevens Award, the Signet Society Medal for
Achievement in the Arts, the Robert Frost Medal, and the Grand Prix de
Biennales Internationales de Poesie.  He served as a  Chancellor of the

from Robert Creeley:

     Help!

Helpâ€™s easy enough
If it comes in time.
Nothingâ€™s that hard
If you want to rhyme.

Itâ€™s when they shoot you
It can hurt,
When the bombs blast off
And youâ€™re gone with a squirt.

Sitting in a bunker,
Feeling blue?
Donâ€™t be a loser,
It wasnâ€™t you â€“

Wasnâ€™t you wanted
To go kill people,
Wasnâ€™t you caused
All this trouble.

I canâ€™t say, Run!
And I canâ€™t say, Hide!
But I still feel
What I feel inside.

Itâ€™s wrong to kill people
Just to make them pay.
Wrong to blast cities
To make them go away.

You canâ€™t take everything
Away from fathers,
Mothers, babies,
Sisters and brothers.

You live in a house?
Wipe your feet!
Take a look around â€“
Ainâ€™t it neat

To come home at night
And have a home,
Be able to sit down
Even all alone?

You think that anyone
Ought to get pushed,
Shoved around
for some old Bush?

Use your head,
Donâ€™t get scared,
Stand up straight,
Show what youâ€™re made of.

Americaâ€™s heaven,
Letâ€™s keep it that way
Which means not killing,
Not running scared,

Not being a creep,
Not wanting to get "them."
Take a chance
And see what they want then.

Maybe just to be safe,
Maybe just to go home,
Maybe just to live
Not scared to the bone,

Not dumped on by world
They wonâ€™t let you into,
Not forgotten by all
The ones who did it to you.

Sing together!
Make sure itâ€™s loud!
Oneâ€™s always one,
But the worldâ€™s a crowd

Of people, people,
All familiar.
Take a look!
At least it wonâ€™t kill you.

Beyond Limits Otherwise Prescribed
BY MICHAEL VENTURA




March 21, 2003:





More than 50% of the population of Iraq is under 15 years old. That is the
fact to remember when discussing the U.S. invasion of that country: The Bush
administration plans to rain 3,000 bombs in 48 hours -- the most
overwhelming bombardment in history -- on a nation that is half children.
This, according to Bush, is in the name of "good," against "evil." No
evidence cited by President Bush, Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld, and
Secretary of State Powell has stood up to scrutiny. Robert Scheer, The Los
Angeles Times, March 11: "After 218 inspections of 141 sites over three
months by the International Atomic Energy Agency, Mohamed ElBaradei charged
that the United States had used fake and erroneous evidence [my italics] to
support claims that Iraq was importing enriched uranium and other material
for the manufacture of nuclear weapons."

As for chemical and biological weapons: The "poison factory" Powell claimed
was operating in northern Iraq was visited by reporters within days of
Powell's UN presentation and found to be without plumbing -- an impossible
condition for a chemical laboratory. That didn't stop Bush from mentioning
the "poison factory" again in his press conference. (No journalist present
had the nerve to call him on that.) Powell claimed "evidence" that Iraq has
"truck-mounted labs" making biochemical weapons. Newsweek, Feb. 17: "Biowar
experts ... say truck-mounted labs would be all but unworkable. The required
ventilation systems would make them instantly recognizable from above, and
they would need special facilities to safely dispose of their deadly wastes.
... And U.S. intelligence, after years of looking for them, has never found
even one." On March 9, military analyst William M. Arkin wrote in The Los
Angeles Times, "Incredible as it may seem, given all the talk by the
administration ... there is simply no hard intelligence of any such Iraqi
weapons. There is not a single confirmed biological or chemical target on
their lists, Air Force officers working on the war plan say [my italics]."
Arkin quotes Maj. Gen. John Doesburg, described as "the Army's top
biological and chemical defense commander": "It takes a lot of chemicals to
have a significant effect on the battlefield. We don't suspect [Saddam] has
the stockpile."

If Saddam Hussein hasn't enough such weapons for a "significant effect" in
defense of his own country, he certainly hasn't enough to spare for a
significant attack on America. That attack may come, but not from him. Which
brings up the strangest and most sinister fact of this chaotic, dangerous
time: Aside from increased airport security (and even that, as many
investigations have proved, is badly flawed), since 9/11 the Bush
administration has done virtually nothing to protect America from a
terrorist attack. Incredible as that may seem, the facts are beyond doubt.

The New York Times, March 3: "The Justice Department's inspector general
reported that the immigration agencies now answering to [Tom Ridge, Homeland
Security secretary] had lost track of thousands of illegal immigrants who
had final court orders for deportation, including many from Iraq," adding,
"[A]mong private scholars and major research groups that study domestic
defense issues, there is a growing consensus that the administration is not
devoting the money needed to keep the public safe from attacks." This is
something of an understatement. Paul Krugman, The New York Times, Feb. 25:
"Firefighters and policemen applauded Mr. Bush's promise, more than a year
ago, of $3.5 billion for 'first responders'; so far, not a penny has been
delivered [my italics]."

Maureen Dowd, The New York Times, Feb. 23: the "American Association of Port
Authorities [estimates] that it would cost $2 billion to make the ports
secure. But since Sept. 11, only $318 million has been spent. Although Mr.
Bush himself endorsed a program to screen cargo at foreign ports, his budget
provides no money for it." A year ago, Rep. Edward J. Markey, D-Mass.,
goaded Bush to place anti-aircraft guns around our vulnerable nuclear power
plants, as other countries have done. Though 21 U.S. nuclear facilities are
located within five miles of an airport, and though only four of our 103
plants were designed with a (small) plane crash in mind, our nuke plants
remain undefended.

A Feb. 20 The New York Times article by Daniel Benjamin and Steven Simon
(members of the National Security Council, 1994-1999) cited many threats
about which nothing has been done: "Recreational kit airplanes can be built
for a few thousand dollars and converted into remote control weapons. These
planes can take off from a grass strip shorter than a football field and
give terrorists an easy means to attack from within American borders. A
growing number of countries, including Pakistan and Iran, have anti-ship
cruise missiles that, if stolen or diverted, could be converted into
land-attack cruise missiles. These missiles can be transported in
nondescript containers and guided by inexpensive global position system
devices to targets mapped with available satellite imagery." As for
shoulder-fired anti-aircraft missiles, they write: "The world is awash in
thousands of these stinger-type missiles. ... Counter-measures ... used on
military aircraft can also be employed on commercial planes. ... In the late
1990s ... the [airline] industry blanched upon learning that it would cost
$1 million to $2 million per plane. ... Washington needs to step in, at a
cost of around $5 billion [about the cost of two American fighter-bombers]."
About these crucial issues, nothing has been done or even suggested by the
Bush White House.

Feb. 13, The New York Times: "Many state and local governments say they are
unprepared to deal with a major terrorist attack because of Washington's
delay in providing them with billions of dollars in emergency-response aid
that was promised shortly after the Sept. 11 attacks."

March 5, The New York Times: Colleen Rowley, the FBI agent who last year
blew the whistle on the agency's mishandling of leads to the 9/11 attackers,
made public her recent letter to FBI Director Robert S. Mueller. In part,
her letter reads: "We should be deluding neither ourselves nor the American
people that there is any way the FBI ... will be able to stem the flood of
terrorism that will likely head our way in the wake of an attack on Iraq."

All the experts testify that Iraq is not a danger to us, and the CIA and FBI
have both reported that the risk of a domestic terrorist attack goes up
immeasurably if we attack Iraq, but Bush is attacking Iraq. All the experts
testify that America is as vulnerable to major terrorist attacks today as it
was on 9/11, but Bush has done almost nothing for domestic defense. The New
York Times, Feb. 3: former Senator Warren Rudman, R-N.H., considered an
expert on domestic security, "said there was 'no rational answer' for the
Bush administration's decision not to seek more money for domestic
security."

There are three possible reasons for Bush's otherwise inexplicable disregard
for America's safety. First is sheer incompetence, induced by madness: He is
so obsessed with Iraq's oil, and/or the glory of conquest, and/or the
compulsion both to revenge and outdo his father, that nothing else
matters -- including our safety. Second is that Bush knows something he
won't admit (for it would demolish his Iraq-attack rationale): that, as Gen.
Ralph E. Eberhart stated, "there is scant intelligence to suggest an
immediate domestic threat from al Qaeda or other terrorist groups" (The New
York Times, Dec. 13). Third, there is what I call the Bush Reichstag
Barbecue Scenario.

On Feb. 27, 1933, a month after Hitler became chancellor of Germany, the
Reichstag (the seat of Germany's parliament) burned down. The evidence
points to the Nazis setting the fire themselves. Hitler's response was
immediate and drastic. He blamed Communist terrorists and issued a decree
that read as follows: "Restrictions on personal liberty, on the right of
free expression of opinion, including freedom of the press; on the rights of
assembly and association; and violations of privacy of postal, telegraphic
and telephonic communications; and warrants for house searches ... are also
permissible beyond the legal limits otherwise prescribed." Bush, Cheney, and
Ashcroft are looking for an excuse to go "beyond the legal limits otherwise
prescribed." A second 9/11 would be an excuse to grab all the power they
give every indication of seeking. They are counting on a stunned and
terrified America to grant them that power. So they are doing nothing to
defend us from terrorism. In fact, they are doing everything to make us
vulnerable to terrorism. The FBI and CIA have assured them that an attack on
Iraq will do just that. And so they attack Iraq. But they are really
attacking ... democracy ... you and I ... and everything the word "America"
once stood for.

from tom bell's post:
<It is a murderous war

"Every people has the government it deserves" (?). “Another quote “Only
those deserve life and freedom who are fighting for it on a day-to-day basis
’ (Goethe?) Why do I have to legitimize my words by these outdated quotes
where it is not quite clear what the author means when he says ‘freedom’,
‘life, 'people', ‘fight’. Actually Goethe’s saying can be used by both sides
of the present conflict to speak about themselves. But basically what these
two quotes mean is that in order to have a decent government you have to
resist on a daily basis. But this here in america is a majoritarian kind of
democracy and most people want to watch TV, shop in a mall and go to church
on Sundays. So if one resists on a daily basis is it enough not to feel
guilty? “Success is a by-product of practice’ (Kierkegaard?) Sorry for
question-marks. I’ve been through two repressive structures - those of the
Soviet Union and patriarchal marriage -and my internal censoring organ
(whatever it is called) had to counter-repress so much that little has been
left in my memory.

Gloria, it is great to see people overseas who know and love chekhov
By way of comment: Chekhov did not take a political stance but his was an
ambivalence that unlike, for example, Gorky’  black and white definitions
could not be easily co-opted into the dominant ideology. He was studied in
high school though. This is in fact astonishing that the Soviet regime could
incorporate and digest - at least to some extent - lots of authors from
Pushkin to Dostoevsky (not all of him though), except for those who did
formal innovation or who probed into the deeper levels of meaning. This is
actually one of the ways pre-revolutionary writers  were discussed. What was
it in their work that made it a convenient/unconvenient tool for the
stalin/brezhnev regime? The writers contemporaneous with the regime were
judged on quite a different basis.

and anothere thing. In Chekhov’s time there was a rather strong feminist
movement in Russia: dozens of radical women’s journals, women’s
organizations etc. The Bestuzhev university-level women’s courses had been
going since 1878. They were opened by the minister of Education Count
Tolstoi (distant relative of the writer) and headed by Pr Bestuzhev, nephew
of a Decembrist Bestuzhev, participant of the 1825 attempted overthrow of
the monarchy hanged on the order of Nicholas I whose son Alexander II was
the tsar at the moment when Pr bestuzhev opened the women's courses. And
look where we are now (I mean Russia in terms of women's movement.
everything is reversible)

Chekhov firmly says that "an artist can reveal the human condition , not
directly alleviate it."  He was appalled personally by inequity, injustice,
indentured servitude after the serfs were free, corruption, laziness and
decadence of the upper classes, etc.  But he never, so far as his
biographies
reccount, took a "political" stance publically.  He certainly must have more
than sensed the revolution on its way--he died in 1904 and there was plenty
going on in the streets.  Something marvelous occurs in his very last
writing, "The Betrothed."  Check it out.  It's proto-feminist.  The girl
leaves the boy and goes off to, gasp, college.

Masha,

My recent post appears to have been misunderstood as many of mine seem
destined to be.  To clarify somewhat:  It was a 3-part message because of
the limits on the listserv.  I think the lines you attribute to me are
actually lines from my translation into a USAcentric poem of a reply sent to
me by Clemente Padin from Uruguay but apparently this medium doesn't lend
itself readily to poetry being seen as poetry rather than polemic?

The "paranoia" in the subject heading refers to another part of the three
part message which is relevant to the Russian context from my limited
understanding of the history there of dissenting writings in the satiric
mode.  No Russian (e.g., Gogol. Akhmatova, Prigov, etc.) would have been
able to call a sitting leader something like this directly.  I may be
speaking too soon here but it does look like we need to resort to samizdat
publication?

I hope I have cleared this up at least to some extent:  My post was intended
as a call for poetry not a demand for a response.

--------------------------

That said, I'd like to move on to this:
quote:
>"But this here in america is a majoritarian kind of
democracy and most people want to watch TV, shop in a mall and go to church
on Sundays. So if one resists on a daily basis is it enough not to feel
guilty? "Success is a by-product of practice' (Kierkegaard?) Sorry for

Soviet Union and patriarchal marriage -and my internal censoring organ
(whatever it is called) had to counter-repress so much that little has been
left in my memory"<.-Masha Zavialova

I must admit I am not fully understanding what I have touched here and would
appreciate further information here on the list or back channel if you care
to send it.  My response in the context of list discussions of the issue and
my current reading of Langer's recent book is to not let the pictures we get
smolder as freeze-frame photographs in my memory but to let them flow out
through the process of poetry.  I'd invite you to take a look through some
of Jim Pennebaker's books and research on this
http://homepage.psy.utexas.edu/homepage/faculty/pennebaker/Pennebaker.html
Granted mine is a male action-oriented response but it is not majoritarian
and I hope that the bits I have posted over the last few weeks have been
taken as satirical or at least caricaturial?

or gee, maybe we all look the same to them? This is from Langer latest:
                                                                   "Far more
lethally -- starting with the attack by Italian fighter planes near Tripoli
in October 1911 -- European nations ad been bombing their colonies.
So-called "air
control operations" were favored as an economical alternative to the costly
practice of maintaining large garrisons to police Britain's more restive
pos-
sions.  One of these was Iraq, which (along with Palestine) had gone to
Britain as pat of the spoils of victory when the Ottoman mpire was dis-
membered after the First World War.  Between 1920 and 1924, the recently
formed Royal Air Force regularly targeted Iraqi villages, often remote
settle-
ments, where the rebellious natives might try to find shelter, with the
raids "carried on continuously...

this new project is called "global text strategies"
www.global-text-strategies.com
the persona is sydney lewis
the logo for this project is a picture
of the commemorative plaque
of the atomic bombing of hiroshima
and nagasaki
a flame taken from the holocaust
has been kept burning
in memory of those murdered
the memorial is at hashino-mura village in fukuoka prefecture

sydney lewis reminds me of my wife who is asian-american
and whose father was held prisoner in the arizona concentration camps
during the war

her father is very taciturn
sydney lewis' intro to her work
is like something my wife's father would say
he is very inscrutable

i am using titles like
"whoosh"
and
"slammm"

because military pilots today experience the war
like a video game in the solitude of their cockpit
tens of thousands of feet above their real-life
target

-augie

oh and there are 2400 volumes in this project so far
each approximately 500 pages long

here are two excerpts
one from slammm
and one from whoosh

>PeaceNik: Why did you say we are we invading Iraq?

>WarMonger: We are invading Iraq because it is in violation of  security

>council resolutions.
>>
>PN: But I thought many of our allies, including Israel, were in  violation

>>
>WM: It's not just about UN resolutions. The main point is that Iraq  could

>well be a mushroom cloud over NY.
>>
>PN: Mushroom cloud? But I thought the weapons inspectors said Iraq  had no
>nuclear weapons.
>>
>WM: Yes, but biological and chemical weapons are the issue.
>>
>PN: But I thought Iraq did not have any long range missiles for  attacking
>us or our allies with such weapons.
>>
>WM: The risk is not Iraq directly attacking us, but rather terrorists
>networks that Iraq could sell the weapons to.
>>
>PN: But couldn't virtually any country sell chemical or biological
>materials? We sold quite a bit to Iraq in the eighties ourselves,  didn't
>we?
>>
>WM: That's ancient history. Look, Saddam Hussein is an evil man that  has an
>undeniable track record of repressing his own people since the  early
>eighties. He gasses his enemies. Everyone agrees that he is a  power-hungry
>lunatic murderer.
>>
>PN: We sold chemical and biological materials to a power-hungry  lunatic

>>
>WM: The issue is not what we sold, but rather what Saddam did. He is  the

>>
>PN: A pre-emptive first strike does sound bad. But didn't our  ambassador to
>Iraq, April Gillespie, know about and green-light the  invasion of Kuwait?
>  >
>WM: Let's deal with the present, shall we? As of today, Iraq could  sell its
>biological and chemical weapons to Al Quaida. Osama BinLaden  himself
>released an audio tape calling on Iraqis to suicide-attack  us, proving a
>partnership between the two.
>>
>PN: Osama Bin Laden? Wasn't the point of invading Afghanistan to kill  him?
>>
>WM: Actually, it's not 100% certain that it's really Osama Bin Laden  on the
>tapes. But the lesson from the tape is the same: there could  easily be a
>partnership between al-Qaida and Saddam Hussein unless we  act.
>>
>PN: Is this the same audio tape where Osama Bin Laden labels Saddam a
>secular infidel?
>>
>WM: You're missing the point by just focusing on the tape. Powell  presented
>a strong case against Iraq.
>>
>PN: He did?
>>
>WM: Yes, he showed satellite pictures of an Al Quaeda poison factory  in
>Iraq.
>>
>PN: But didn't that turn out to be a harmless shack in the part of  Iraq

>>
>WM: And a British intelligence report...

>PN: Didn't that turn out to be copied from an out-of-date graduate  student

>>
>WM: And reports of mobile weapons labs...
>  >
>PN: Weren't those just artistic renderings?
>>
>WM: And reports of Iraqis scuttling and hiding evidence from  inspectors...
>>
>PN: Wasn't that evidence contradicted by the chief weapons inspector,  Hans
>Blix?
>>
>WM: Yes, but there is plenty of other hard evidence that cannot be  revealed
>because it would compromise our security.
>>
>PN: So there is no publicly available evidence of weapons of mass
>destruction in Iraq?
>>
>WM: The inspectors are not detectives, it's not their JOB to find  evidence.
>You're missing the point.
>>
>PN: So what is the point?
>>
>WM: The main point is that we are invading Iraq because resolution  1441
>threatened "severe consequences." If we do not act, the security  council
>will become an irrelevant debating society.
>>
>PN: So the main point is to uphold the rulings of the security  council?
>>
>WM: Absolutely. ...unless it rules against us.
>>
>PN: And what if it does rule against us?
>>
>WM: In that case, we must lead a coalition of the willing to invade  Iraq.
>>
>PN: Coalition of the willing? Who's that?
>>
>WM: Britain, Turkey, Bulgaria, Spain, and Italy, for starters.
>>
>PN: I thought Turkey refused to help us unless we gave them tens of
>billions of dollars.
>>
>WM: Nevertheless, they may now be willing.
>>
>PN: I thought public opinion in all those countries was against war.
>>
>WM: Current public opinion is irrelevant. The majority expresses its  will

>>
>PN: So it's the decisions of leaders elected by the majority that is

>>
>WM: Yes.
>>
>PN: But George Bush wasn't elected by voters. He was selected by the  U.S.
>Supreme C...-
>>
>WM: I mean, we must support the decisions of our leaders, however they were

>>
>PN: So if we do not support the decisions of the president, we are  not

>>
>WM: I never said that.
>>
>PN: So what are you saying? Why are we invading Iraq?
>>
>WM: As I said, because there is a chance that they have weapons of  mass

>>
>PN: But the inspectors have not been able to find any such weapons.
>>
>WM: Iraq is obviously hiding them.
>>
>PN: You know this? How?
>>
>WM: Because we know they had the weapons ten years ago, and they are  still

>
>PN: The weapons we sold them, you mean?

>WM: Precisely.
>>
>PN: But I thought those biological and chemical weapons would degrade  to an

>>
>WM: But there is a chance that some have not degraded.

>PN: So as long as there is even a small chance that such weapons  exist, we

>>
>WM: That's a diplomatic issue.
>>
>PN: So why are we invading Iraq instead of using diplomacy?

That steal the goose from off the common,
But let the greater villain loose
That steals the common from the goose.

to render the head too large for the body.  A standing military
force with an overgrown executive will not long be safe.

Thanks for the information about the proto-feminist movement, Masha.  What
other pre-Soviet writers were still read and taught for those eighty years,
besides Chekhov and Pushkin?  How about Tolstoy? Goncharev?

I've been smelling Vietnam since Afghanistan.

Please don't put Rumsfeld on any golf courses near me. He'd poison any

Hi there.

We thought you might like to hear about "Memefest: The International
Festival of Radical Communication"

As a concept, Memefest crawled out of Slovenia's academic and artistic mix
in response to the recent conditions of the country's cultural environment.
While continually exposed to radical doses of branding and commercial
information over the last decade, and an educational system which has geared
talented youth more and more towards market professions such as the
advertising industry, we, the founders of Memefest,have decided to create a
space to help Slovenian and global youth to rise up against the powers that
be while celebrating the strengths and talents these young communicators
bring to their subversion.

 ... Every year, we invite submissions from international activists which
critically approach cultural issues through text and visuals.  ... For those
interested, visit

www.memefest.org

No matter what you do with memefest, we appreciate your input to keep it
going. Afterall, the world is a pretty f*#&%@ place and we've just begun.

Thanks,

The Organizers of Memefest 2003

i don't think it is too soon. magazines, passed among friends, are the
samizdat publications of our time, i think; the web utterly traceable,
therefore, co-opted?

Subject: Funding Cut For NPR

The current Administration is looking to get rid of
NPR,
  the National Endowments and PBS. Is censorship next?

  Please read and forward to your e mail rolodex. Even
if you
  disagree with the politics- a voice for both sides
must
  exist and the arts survive.

  On NPR's Morning Edition, Nina Totenberg said if the
Supreme
  Court supports Congress, it is in effect the end of
the National
  Public Radio (NPR), NEA &the Public Broadcasting
System (PBS).
  PBS, NPR and the arts are facing major cutbacks in
funding. In
  spite of the efforts to reduce costs and streamline
services,
  government officials believe that the funding
currently going
  to these programs is too large for something which
is seen as not
  worthwhile. The only way that our representatives
can be aware of
  the base of support for PBS and funding for such
programs is by
  making our voices heard.

Please add your name to this petition and forward it
to friends who believe in what this stands for. This
is for anyone who thinks NPR/PBS is a worthwhile
expenditure of  $1.12/year of their taxes. This
petition is being passed around the Internet and
will be forwarded to the President and the Vice President
of the United States. Please add your name to it so
funding can be maintained for NPR, PBS, &the NEA.


If you prefer not to sign, please don't kill it.
Send it to the Email address listed here: wein2688@blue.univnorthco.edu


NOTE: It is preferable that you SELECT (highlight)
the entirety of this letter and then COPY it into a new
outgoing message, rather than simply forwarding it.
In your new outgoing message, add your name to the
bottom of the list, then send it on. (Or do a SEND
AGAIN.)

If you happen to be the 150th, 200th, 250th, etc.,
signer of this petition, please forward a copy to:
wein2688@blue.univnorthco.edu   This way we can keep
track of the lists and organize them.

You might think this callous of me, but if NPR weren't in bed with the
Pentagon, if NPR *tried* to report on topics and in ways that weren't
biased toward US military action, Palestinian occupation, post 911
nationalism and the cult of "tragedy and hero," I'd be inclined to sign
this petition. But I'm not. Fuck um.

Uh, this petition is about 8 years old, the e-mail address to which
one is supposed to forward petitions has been closed for nearly 8
years, and the letter doesn't accurately describe any current
legislative or Supreme Court (?) actions that are relevant to funding
or not funding these federal agencies.

In other words, it's a waste of time, effort, & bandwidth to forward
or respond to it. Here are some details for those who care
<http://urbanlegends.about.com/library/weekly/aa052798.htm?terms=nea>.

Note that virtually every argument against this petition is true of
other Internet petition: within a week or two, the exponential growth
of the number of recipients responding usually results in the closing
down of the e-mail account to which one is supposed to reply.

Calls to action are much more effective.

Bests,

Herb

I don't think you're entirely right here - NPR does provide a large amount of
alternative news & viewpoints - they;'re the only ones on my car-radio dial
who have poets on, the're the only ones who have guests with unorthodox
political and cultural views.  So I think that any amount of "alternativenss"
is better than none at all.

Subject:      what poets/poetry can do: history as BTW
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain

Ray, Masha, Tom, Gloria and All,

To talk about "sides speaking about the other and really describing the
self," is to talk about the inherent binarism founding any given
western-'cultural moment.' This is not news, but it is a retroactive
binarism that continues to structure concepts of conflict-thus the Vietnam
connection we feel creeping around it,too.

Such binarism can be mediated and redirected without too much
trouble--Bush's admin seems to revel in binarism, to flaunt it, for
instance, even knowing that it is also easily rebutted, if there were an
equally prominent media place for rebuttal to be heard.  Of course, that
Bush is a butt is also a given--but beyond such attempts to intervene as
poets against the war, any rebut of Bush (except on The Onion) seems out of
the question.  And BTW, while we're on it, just how well is any western
humor about this war working?--I mean, how well is such humor helping anyone
who is being bombed out of existance right this 'moment of cultural crisis'.
Like the contradictory effects of Aristophanes's plays,such humor seems more
to keep us all from thinking harder and acting more decisively about the
real issues, but who can rebut the hegemony of Aristophanes today and keep
an audience that will then go out an act resistantly (yet without binaristic
repetitions)?

But yes, it also seems that power brokers/politicos in any given historical
moment will strive for, and to be perceived as caught in, simplistic binary
conflict/means to achieve concentrated power and material gains.   This
makes it more difficult for many to understand what "gain" is.  If it is
defined as actions rhetorical and/or otherwise in opposition to simple
binary effects, it's at once more difficult to conceive and also more
subject to being reversible--I'm thinking not so much of any Foucault or
Derrida here but more along the lines of Walter Benjamin's Angel of History,
and of hegemony theory in general.

So--and this is not a new question but like any real resistances also needs
to be continually revived--without getting too theory-based or
hazy/e-the-REAL, poetry that "resist(s) on a daily basis" would be action
worth commiting... but how to know it isn't also falling into the same old
trap of binary driven conflict?--how to make it reach beyond that? I think
that's something to dig deeper with.

Lighting his cigarette, still
tense from desktop explosion,
Shaun offered his gaze to the
sky, which hungered above him

in triggered fonts. Tabitha thought
maybe this time, maybe, averages
would lull Yasir to unkempt suffocation.
Still, Peter was a seasoned,

slightly salty explorer of cruel
love; it had taken him to Basra, then
onto Baghdad, where Shaun's oils
still lingered in Tabitha's mouth.

As for the rest of them, I think we left
enough food: dead burnished by a deserted sun.

There is a chilling and very interesting article in last weeks NY Times
magazine by Paul Berman on the critique of binarism by the Islamic
philosopher Sayyid Qutb.  Worth reading and taking seriously.
       Benjamin, as you point out, is worth rereading at this moment.  He
could have seen it coming, and since he is an angel perhaps sees it and weeps.

About thirty years ago, I briefly met Nathan Whiting, who was
then on the verge of some local NYC renown as a running poet.
One of his early books of poetry came out from New Rivers Press,
which also did mine.

This afternoon, Lynda and I got back from Chicago, and I found
this account of Nathan's brush with the NYPD at last Saturday's
march. It's below the sig.

======================


Dear Friends,

I'm writing this to you because I know you've been involved in the anti-war
movement, and care about what's going on right now. But there might be more
going on than you realize.

I received a disturbing phone call today from my old friend, poet and
dancer Nathan Whiting -- whom many of you know. He was arrested at
Saturday's demonstration, for no reason but that he looked like an aging
hippie who couldn't defend himself. He couldn't give too many details,
because assault charges are now being brought against him (as he put it,
when there are four cops holding you down, one of them sitting on your
head, you tend to fight back). He was given a "ride" to the station --
which meant he was tightly handcuffed, thrown alone in the back of an
all-metal van, no wood anywhere, then it took a half hour to drive to the
station house five blocks away, going fast over the roughest streets the
cops could find, then arrived at the station house to be told no, they
should take him to central booking. All in all, he spent two hours being
driven around in that manner. He was held a total of 20 hours, received
several bad bruises, and lost 8 pounds.

As those of you who know Nathan will I'm sure agree, there's nothing
hostile about him, and I can't picture him (with Nancy at his side), doing
anything to provoke arrest. Joking, perhaps, maybe mistaken for hostile
sarcasm, but certainly not cause for brute force. And many of the fellow
protestors he met in jail have similar stories. Because of the new
anti-terrorist laws, they can now hold people for 72 hours, without letting
them talk to a lawyer, and without giving them a reason they're being held.
The news media isn't covering this part, but it's important to know, and to
let others know.

I just noticed this from Bob Grumann:

Date:    Thu, 27 Mar 2003 08:29:06 -0800
From:    Bob Grumman <comprepoetica@YAHOO.COM>
Subject: Re: It was an outrage, an obscenity

I think that anyone who believes that the United
States armed forces are not bending over backwards to
avoid killing or injuring Iraqi civilians is insane.
One can even suspect that they are doing so for
political rather than humanitarian reasons, and retain
one's leftist standing.  The point is, that they are
doing so, occasional misfires notwithstanding.
Otherwise, how can one account for the number of
civilians in Baghdad who are still alive?

Now, then, anyone for a discussion of poetry?

--Bob G. (perhaps the only one contributing to this
forum who is certain he lacks sufficient pertinent
data about the Middle East to have a worthwhile
opinion about the ongoing war)

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>.

Well, no discussion of poetry from me.  That's why I've had nothing to say
to this list for months.  I just want to let Bob G. know that there is
pertinent data out there for him to consider, if he cares to, though he
doesn't seem to care to.

Consider this from the NY TImes:

- QUOTATION OF THE DAY -

"It's a judgment call. If the risks outweigh the losses, then you don't take
the shot."

- CPL. MIKAEL McINTOSH, a Marine sharpshooter, on confronting Iraqi fighters
among

civilians.



http://www.nytimes.com/2003/03/29/international/worldspecial/29HALT.html?th


Actually, what caught my attention was this, from  a Sergeant Schrumpf:" We
dropped a few civilians," Sergeant Schrumpf said, "but what do you do?"

And then this:

But more than once, Sergeant Schrumpf said, he faced a different choice: one
Iraqi soldier standing among two or three civilians. He recalled one such
incident, in which he and other men in his unit opened fire. He recalled
watching one of the women standing near the Iraqi soldier go down.

"I'm sorry," the sergeant said. "But the chick was in the way."
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

Well, Bob G., now you've got some pertinent data to work with.

Best, as always,

George Thompson

http://hypobololemaioi.com announces the 2003 edition of one writer's
works of poetry and prose, online since January 2001, in html format,
and now including seven ebooks,image-plates of three manuscripts, and
one 15 second digital study.

Among the ebooks, the newest work, "Pacifist," written in Russia last
year, features an essay on Osip Mandelstam and Walter Benjamin, which
first appeared on the generation_online discussion list, and a public
address, 'Promising Young People,' written for a conference at
Zabaikalsky State Pedagogical University, which reads Jonathan Swift's
Gulliver and Journal to Stella against the background of Slavoj
Zizek's "Ticklish Subject." There are also a group of poems, 'Social
Units / Shadow Text,' which first appeared in an issue of the online
journal, "Beehive."

From pages 112 and 120 of "Pacifist":

"To write a single word commensurate to the observed gesture,
gentleness.

The exposure, sensitivity to the exposure. The need for
silence. Silence as protection. Perception. Where words break. The
trembling.

Without the protection of words, the winter coat, their pronouns. The
'I' and the 'you' protect against exposure, the life, living, wanting
and needing. 'We, us, ours.'

Silence. The fear for the word. The fear of the words, trembling,
breaking. Celan's 'Aufheban' means to 'keep' or 'pressure' as well as
to 'put a stop to' or 'halt'(and to hypostatize is to deny movement)."

...

"if to exist means to be generated writing exists to generate more
than itself, becomes common contains, consider, ordinary

proposition, state, that the writing exists for itself statement, my
writing states the State must be overthrown"

Gruesome toll grows as army grinds to a halt
By Paul McGeough
March 30 2003
The Sun-Herald Lucky... [PHOTOGRAPH: Saja Jaafar, 3, lies in a Baghdad
hospital after surviving the bombing of the al-Naser market in the Shuwaila
district. Photo: AFP ]
Silver stars and red tracer fire lit the sky as the Al Shualla people
washed their dead - as many as 58 of them were slaughtered when a bomb
exploded in their little marketplace.
Some carried blanket-draped coffins through darkened alleyways, others
strapped them to the roofs of battered cars.
But from all houses the same teary cries drifted into the chilly night:
"There is no god but God."
As each family group left the
mosque, the men faced Mecca in prayer and the lights of passing cars etched
the outline of their women, standing in tight knots off to the side.
Iraqi officials insist this bomb, the second in 48 hours to hit a civilian
market, was dropped by a US or British jet. The Americans are
investigating; they say they don't know.
But the suffering and the grief radiating from a small crater in this
impoverished Shi'ite neighbourhood in Baghdad will make it harder for
ordinary Iraqis to see the US-led invasion force as an army of liberation,
rather than one of conquest.
At the Al-Noor Hospital, 500metres from the marketplace in north-west
Baghdad, tearful men held each other in their arms as distraught women
yelled the names of the dead.
A man, sobbing with grief, called over and over: "That man! That man!"
Relatives said he was referring to President George Bush, who, in
Washington, appeared to be warning of more setbacks before victory in
saying: "We are now fighting the most desperate units of the dictator's
army. The fierce fighting under way will demand further courage and further
sacrifice, yet we know the outcome of this battle."
In the face of stiff resistance and severe front-line problems - security
and logistic - US commanders have now decided on a pause of up to six days
in their advance on Baghdad.
The Al Shualla carnage came on a day in which the US seemed to put aside
its undertaking not to damage Iraq's infrastructure: waves of strikes,
including the first confirmed use of 4700-pound (2100 kilogram)
bunker-buster bombs, destroyed much of Baghdad's telephone system.
In Al Shualla, at 6.30pm, people were busy in the market. Ghannun Hussein
was waiting for his 59-year-old father with the vegetables for their
evening meal when he heard the whoosh of a missile.
Standing by his father's hospital bed later, he said: "I heard the
explosion. I ran. All the people were on the ground; people's arms and legs
were cut off, there was too much blood."
Najin Abdula, who works at the hospital, raced to the scene: "There was the
body of a man with no head. I stopped cars in the traffic to get them to
bring the injured to the hospital."
Then he opened the door of a morgue refrigerator for The Sun-Herald. Inside
were five bodies. One young man had half his head blown away; the nose of
another was gone and his flesh and clothing were torn.
As family members and hospital staff, many in tears, worked feverishly,
survivors who could talk spoke of their split-second encounter with war.
Khalid Jabar Hussein, 49, with shrapnel in his arm, wrist and leg, said:
"First I heard an aircraft and then the missile coming at us and I don't
know anything after that. I fell down."
Sajaja Jaafur, one of five in her family who were injured, lay in her bed,
crying with pain as she tried to turn to face her mother.Her lovely olive
skin was torn, there was a tube in her nose and a blood-stained dressing
around her abdomen.
Samaan Kadhim, 52, sedated with a bad gash on his back, said: "This was a
civilian area, there were no soldiers. It was just a market."
In the midst of all this, Dr Ahmed Sufian lashed out: "Our floors are
covered with blood of our people, the walls are splashed with blood. Why,
why, why? Why all this blood? I'm a doctor, but I can't understand such
things. They say [they] come to free us? Is this freedom?"
There was no overt support for Saddam Hussein, but all blamed the US for
the bombing. There was no hostility towards western reporters invited by
families to witness their grief.
"America did this to us," said 50-year-old Kadhim Ali. "Why does it hate
the Iraqi people?"

Still Searching for Plan B


Let me rephrase this. I'll try to give you some idea of the fraughtness
of our current situation—our self-indulgence, our incessant shopping,

our lugging home of consumer goods, not excluding vegetables and other
edibles, our attics and basements and garages bulging with original packing

materials, lest we ever have to ship some product back to its original
manufacturer for repair or replacement. All of this, a cutthroat business,

requiring us to pay the postal and/or freight charges on our returns.
Take, for example, our troops in Iraq or in other fields of endeavor. Who

who will pay to have them flown or shipped home to their kith, to their kin,
to their work-a-day-world jobs as veterinarians, say, or teachers, or

orthodontists? Victory will flood our shores with them, all wanting
their old jobs back, their original wives and kids, and even babies

born since they left home—to protect our freedoms, to wreak
justice on the world, to keep our store shelves fully stocked.

Liberation shouldn't be death, or oil, when business
fists sift through an unwilling countryside. A butcher
wipes the excess of a people's hunger on his apron;
the swath is black, like tar rumbling in the
truck-tank. When I walk Staples Mill (named for the
old plantation and its simpler lifestyle, when
skin-color was economic), I walk against a tide of
surging vehicles;

uncap the growl at a filling station, stare down that
blank eye into the belly of pro rallies: are we all
sliding there? Last night we made love twice,
trickling the gush of our desire over each other, and
it was a more pleasing rain than this. I sit here at
the bottom of my country, whole and unharmed, limited
to slash-and-burn theories of how to better myself in
their

religion, staring up at the cruelty and crying: when
will liberation and love lie down together in
unstained grass? Are 500 faraway deaths no more near
than an ocean of automobiles?

the possibilities for aesthetic daring, playful poetics and a politics of joy
and resistance. The CD includes many of the authors discussed: Ashbery,

so language is born
it's nothing
and born bloody:


and from Andre Frenaud:

Nous arriverons trop tard, le massacre est commence,
les innocents sont couches dans l'herbe.


and from Rene Char: Leaves of Hypnos No. 128 (transl. Cid Corman)

The baker hadn't yet unfastened the iron shutters of his shop when the
village was besieged, gagged, hypnotized, completely brought to a
standstill.  Two companies of SS and a detachment of militia held it under
the muzzle of their machineguns and mortars.  Then began the ordeal.

The inhabitants were tossed out of their houses and summoned to assemble in
the central square.  Keys in the doors.  An old man, hard of hearing, who
didn't respond to the order quickly enough, saw the four walls and roof of
his barn blown to pieces by a bomb.  Since four o'clock I'd been alerted.
Marcelle had come to my shutter to whisper the word to me.  I'd realized
immediately the uselessness of trying to get past the cordon of surveillance
and out into the countryside.  I quickly changed lodgings.  The uninhabited
house where I took refuge allowed, in the last extremity, an effective armed
resistance.  I could follow from the window, behind the yellowed curtains,
the nervous comings and goings of the occupying forces.  Not one of my men
was in the village.  That thought reassured me. Some kilometers away, they
would follow my instructions and remain under cover.  Blows reached me,
punctuated by curses.  The SS had surprised a young mason who was coming
back from retrieving some traps.  His fright set him up for their tortures.
A voice bent over the swollen body shouting: "Where is he?  Show us,"
followed by silence.  And kicks and riflebutts raining.  An insensate rage
possessed me, chased my anguish away.  My hands communicated to my gun their
clenched sweat, exalted its contained power.  I calculated that the poor
devil would hold his tongue for five minutes yet, the, inevitably, he *would
talk.*  I was ashamed to wish him dead before this happened.  Then there
appeared rushing from each street a flood of women, children, old men, going
to the place of assembly, according to a *concerted plan.*  They hurried
without haste, literally streaming over the SS, paralyzing them "in all good
faith."  The mason was left for dead.  Furious, the patrol ploughed its way
through the crowd and made further off.  With an infinite prudence now, some
anxious kindly eyes looked in my direction, passed like a flashing lamp on
my window.  I half revealed myself and a smile broke from my pallor.  I held
to these people by a thousand confident threads of which not one could
break.

I loved my kind wildly that day, well beyond sacrifice.

Away from the list for a few days, missed 'embedded reporter' thread
while it was red hot.  But I'd written this--war breeds
synchronicities--so thought I'd send it.

P.S.  another big 'thumbs down' on the NPR Fanfare For A War:
concerned, informed, brainily rah-rah, tepid.  The aural equivalent of
Tiger's Nike swoosh.



EMBEDDED REPORTER

Embedded reporter got Mafia warning –
Dead fish with rose in mouth.  Tight lips on your standard
camera bearer—if they burn a thatched hut it won’t be
next to a reporter!!

Variables can be embedded (access, pressure).
Intelligence technology’s embattled tentacles
use existing infrastructure – inductive loops
  ::.already embedded.::
       & ‘media enbeds’
installed in different network segments:
‘kill the report, not the reporter’

Washington whispers to vipers---
under its wings for an upcoming war,
they want the "terminal ID" numbers of every embedded
reporter's satellite phone.  Why’s that?  Why  risk
a high profile journal?  NBC, meet
    ROBOSCRIBE …

Dissatisfied with your search results?
Proven ease of color touch,
stirring rocktronic theme and dissolving logo
swooshes across the reality front
“... If we utilize this competitive advantage thing,
reality never sets” in
truth I was due to be "embedded"
on the green screen, there and there ...

Sorry, this was intended for Barry W. only. The "discourse" (a good one) - a
back and forth including Jim Berhle and Carla Harryman takes place on
"Circulars" - and not here.

from An Ocean of Terror chapter


On 23 May 2000, the British defence minister Geoff Hoon, questioned in the
House of Commons about the pattern of Anglo-Ameircan attacks on Iraq replied:

"Between 1 Aug 1992 and 16 Dec 1998, UK aircraft released 2.5 tons of
ordnance over the southern no-fly zone at an average of 0.025 tons per
month. We do not have sufficiently detailed records of coalition activity
in this period to estimate what percentage of the coalition total this
represents. Between 20 Dec 1998 and 17 May 2000, UK aircraft released 78
tons of ordnance over the southern no-fly zone, at an average of 5 tons per
month. This figure represents approximately 20 percent of the coalition
total for this period. [Hansard, 24 May 2000]"

In other words, over a period of 18 months the US and UK had rained down
some 400 tons of bombs and missiles on Iraq. Tony Blair had been dropping
deadly explosives on the country at a rate 20 times greater than his
Conservative predecessor, John Major. What explains this escalation? Its
immediate origins are no mystery. On 16 Dec 1998 Clinton, on the eve of a
vote indicting him for perjury and obstruction of justice in the House of
Representatives, unleased a round-the-clock aerial assault on Iraq,
ostensibly to punish the regime in Baghdad for failure to cooperate with UN
inspectors, in fact to help deflect impeachment. Operation Desert Fox,
fittingly named after a Nazi general, ran for 70 hours, blasting a 100 targets.

Thereafter, far from dying down, the firestorm continued. In August 1999
the New York Times reported:

"American warplanes have methodically and with virtually no public
discussion been attacking Iraq. In the last eight months, American and
British pilots have fired more than 1,100 missiles against 359 targets in
Iraq. This is triple the number of targets attacked in four furious days of
strikes in December . . . By another measure, pilots have flown about
two-thirds as many missions as NATO pilots flew over Yugoslavia in
seventy-eight days of around-the-clock war there. [NYT, 13 Aug 1999]

In October 1999 American officials were telling the Wall Street Journal
they would soon be running out of targets -- 'We're down to the last
outhouse.' By the end of the year, the Anglo-American air forces had flown
more than 6,000 sorties, and dropped over 1,800 bombs on Iraq. By early
2001 the bombardment of Iraq had lasted longer than the US invasion in Vietnam.

A decade of assault from the air has yet been the lesser part of the
purgatory inflicted on Iraq. Blockade by land and sea has caused still
greater suffering. Economic sanctions have drive a population whose levels
of nutrition, schooling and public services were once well above regional
standards into fathomless misery. Before 1990 the country had a per capita
GNP of over $3,000. Today it is under $500, making Iraq one of the poorest
societies on Earth. [Peter Pallet, The Seige of Iraq, p. 155] A land that
once had high levels of literacy and an advanced system of of health-care
has been devastated by the West. Its social structure is in ruins, its
people are denied the basic necessities of existence, its soil is polluted
by uranium-tipped warheads. According to UN figures of 2001, some 60
percent of the population have no regular access to clean water, and over
80 percent of schools need substantial repairs. In 1997 the FAO reckoned
that 27 percent of Iraqis suffering from chronic malnutrition, and 70
percent of all women were anemic. UNICEF reports that in the southern and
central regions which contain 85 percent of the country's population,
infant mortality has doubled compared to the pre-Gulf War period. [UN Rpt
on the Current Humanitarian Situation in Iraq, March 1999]

Duh! What's to deconstruct? It just means whatever asshole said this is
trying to piss off USAmericans... and evidently working. Why do you let

My own feelings, and even thoughts, run along something like these lines:

I noticed tonight a demo in Indonesia that claimed Britain, the US and
Australia were the 'enemy'. I pondered this and reflected that, although the
US is now the primary power, what is happening now, at least in some
respects, is an acting out of the former British Empire. Although that might
seem strange Victorian Britain was the place where the first global economy
was generated. Its former colony, the dear US, which was busy having a civil
war, was identified as the future source  of world power by people like De
Quincey, he forecast that English would become the world's lingua franca.
Its not I think a matter of consciously articulated intentions, in the most
part, but rather patterns that have been laid down by history of which we
need to free ourselves. I'd echo here, in a different sense, Joyce's words
for Stephen:

'History is the nightmare from which I'm trying to awake'.

Gloria Frym recently suggested that Benjamin was worth re-reading at this
moment. I'd like to suggest that the first essay to reread might be his last
published work, "Theses on the Philosophy of History." Needless (?) to say,
I've just done it . . . and found material *extremely* relevant to some
respondents on this list and to the provocative exchange which has been
developing on "Circulars" these last few days.

In relation to the current language of war, check these quotes out . . .
from section VI . . .

"Historical materialism [which practice Benjamin supports, as opposed to
"historicism"] wishes to retain that image of the past which unexpectedly
appears to man [sic] singled out by history at a moment of danger. The
danger affects both the content of the tradition and its receivers. The same
threat hangs over both: that of becoming a tool of the ruling classes. In
every era the attempt must be made anew to wrest tradition away from a
comformism that is about to overpower it. . . . Only that historian will
have the gift of fanning the spark of hope in the past who is firmly
convinced that *even the dead* will not be safe from the enemy if he wins.
And this enemy has not ceased to be victorious."

and the classic angel passage from section IX . . .

"This is how one pictures the angel of history.  His face is turned toward
the past.  Where we perceive a chain of events, he sees one single
catastrophe which keeps piling wreckage upon wreckage and hurls it in front
of his feet.  The angel would like to stay, awaken the dead, and make whole
what has been smashed.  But a storm is blowing from Paradise; it has got
caught in his wings with such violence that the angel can no longer close
them.  This storm irresistably propels him into the future to which his back
is turned, while the pile of debris before him goes skyward. This storm is
what we call progress."

Or as I wrote in my journal last night, rather more clumsily . . .

PATRIARCHAL SONNET

its first deep attack
from deep inside Iraq
"it was pretty spectacular"
that first deep attack

"what was it like
from the cockpit?"
hard and fast conclusions
a Western lifestyle mall

embedded deep inside Iraq
we're going to teach them a lesson
an intense night of bombing
"as when a broadcast, tightly controlled by

conquering censors, begins transmission . . ."
"Fuck Iraq"

Joe Safdie

P.S. to Gloria: I don't think I've ever asked you, but have you had to
endure many bad Van Morrison jokes?

Benjamin, as you point out, is worth rereading at this moment. He could have
seen it coming, and since he is an angel perhaps sees it and weeps.

"Then he [the Prophet] made the end [of his words] correspond to the be-
ginning in feminine gender, while he placed the masculine between the
two. For he began with 'women' and he ended with 'prayer,' and both words
are feminine. Perfume stands between the two, just as the masculine stands
between two feminines in existence. For the man is placed between an
Essence from which he becomes manifest and a woman who becomes manifest
from him. Hence he is between two feminines: the feminine gender of the
Essence and the real femininity of the woman. In a similar way, 'women' is
a real feminine, while 'prayer' is an unreal feminine. Between the two,
'perfume' is like Adam between the Essence from which he comes into
existence, and Eve, who comes into existence from him." (Ibn al-'Arabi, in
Sachiko Murata, The Tao of Islam, A Sourcebook on Gender Relationships in
Islamic Thought.)

"The real thing may not be fearsome enough, and
therefore needs to be enhanced; or reenacted more con-
vincingly.  Thus. the first newsreel ever made of a battle --
a much-publicized incident in Cuba during the Spanisj-
American War of 1898 known as the Battle of San Juan
Hill -- in fact shows a charge staged shortly afterward by
Colonel Theodore Roosevel and his volunteer cavalry
unit, the Rough Riders, for the Vitagraph cameramen,
the actual charge up the hill, after it was filmed, having
been judged insufficiently dramatic." - S. Langer.

Dostoyevsky's, seem a turnin poit in the history of
moral feelings and of sorrow - as deep, as original, as de-

                                                                    While
the image, like every image, is an invitation to look, the
caption, more often than not, insists on the difficulty of
doing just that.  A voice badgers the viewer: can you bear
to look at this?. _Esto es malo_.  _Esto es peor_. Why?
_Por que_?" - Langer

Dawn wads up some
crepescular negritude,
like finding John Brown's body bruised
back into the hollows of your dreams. He'll just
give you Mingus' number;

porkpie hat cocked soddenly cheerful
in the surprise snow of March passing.
Out on the
white house
lawn,

Dawn sheds her dress in flirty
ripples of prodigal light. Aime
Cesaire and Georges Braque
count the spirals on a notebook
of misplaced real estate, where

misplaced people fight an invasion
of strip malls. They'll always win, just
won't notice it. You lie back
in your leopardskin pillbox chair,

dawn nodding out on morning's
solipsistic shoulder, and let me
calculate through your veins
these seconds before water

slaps us in the eyes
to wake us up.

Last night on C-Span, Colin Powell, in a talk before the American Israel
Public Affairs Committee's Annual Conference, threatened both Syria and Iran:

He said, "Tehran must stop pursuing weapons of mass destruction."

He also said, "Syria now faces a critical choice! Syria bears the burdens
of its choices and teh consequences."

And this morning I see there's an article about it at
http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/2901689.stm

And Syria says "we will not wait to be next" encouraging suicide attacks
against anglo-american invaders in Iraq.
http://216.26.163.62/2003/me_syria_03_28.html

PS, I'd heard back on another list that the FUCK IRAQ scan was photoshopped
and analyzed on snopes.com as an "urban legend."

The Holloway Poetry Series presents

Juliana Spahr and Erik Schneider

Thursday, April 3

Colloquium with the poets begins at 4:30 p.m. in 305 Wheeler Hall, UC
Berkeley

Readings begin at 6 p.m., Maud Fife Room, 315 Wheeler Hall, UC Berkeley

Juliana Spahr was born in Chillicothe, Ohio in 1966 but she currently lives
in Honolulu, Hawai`i. Her books include Fuck You-Aloha-I Love You (Wesleyan,
2001), Everybody's Autonomy: Connective Reading and Collective Identity (U
of Alabama, 2001), and Response (Sun & Moon, 1996). She co-edits the journal
Chain with Jena Osman (archive at http://www.temple.edu/chain). She
frequently self-publishes her work. Eventually an online version of this
work will be available at http://epc.buffalo.edu/authors/spahr.

Erik Schneider is a PhD candidate in the Department of Rhetoric at UC
Berkeley. His work is primarily concerned with ethics and metonymic
theories of the subject; an ardent fan of the wild west, he is most
especially concerned with articulating a restless ethics of the
frontier which will leave rugged individualism in tatters. Currently
his art and poetry consist of investigations of repetition,
obsession, and perversion as they constitute and contest the
delineating gesture. Erik has never published unless you count that
zine he and his partner put out back in the early 80s.

Free and open to the public: bring friends!

Here is the Crusade that Bin Laden wanted. GW bit the bait. September 11 attacks couldn't unite the Arab world against the West. It took this administration to fulfill Osama's vision. Tragically stupid, painfully true.

Don't you think it's the other way around?  It's the crusade Bush
wanted... Bin Laden bit the bait.  Hussein's regime alone couldn't
unite the U.S. against the Arab world.  It took 9/11 to fulfill Bush's
vision.  Tragically ingenious, painfully true.

"iduna" brings poetic awareness to the form “book” and demolishes the
Nietzscheian god with its disruption of grammar and syntax. "iduna,"
like gender performativity, is a multiplicity of shifting and
overlapping texts identities and locations. half human, half computer,
"iduna" is spiritual syncope of form and content. "iduna" is manifesto
patterns and a cut and paste pastiche of the begining of the 21
century.  "iduna" is a book that begs for the reader to be embodied
when engaging with it. "iduna" is a dream.

Al-Ahram Weekly
March 27-April 2, 2003

Resources of hope

The two major catastrophes currently facing the Arab world, the US-led
war against Iraq and the Israeli war against the Palestinians, dominate
political debate. At a roundtable organised by Al-Ahram Weekly this
week, Edward Said and a number of political analysts debated the
challenges the Arabs face today. Amina Elbendary attended
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
----

The roundtable hosting Edward Said and a number of Egyptian political
analysts and Al-Ahram Weekly staff took place as the American bombing of
Iraq was casting heavy shadows over discussions on the future of the
Arab world.

"It's a very fateful moment in a way because of this deeply unpopular
and reckless war that a small group within the American administration
has decided to wage against Iraq, and, in a way, against the whole Arab
world. My strong opinion, though I don't have any proof in the classical
sense of the word, is that they want to change the entire Middle East
and the Arab world, perhaps terminate some countries, destroy the
so-called terrorist groups they dislike and install regimes friendly to
the United States. I think this is a dream that has very little basis in
reality. The knowledge they have of the Middle East, to judge from the
people who advise them, is to say the least out of date and widely
speculative," argued Said.

The question of who advises the current American administration on its
Middle East policy was one recurring throughout the discussion. "The two
greatest outside influences on the administration's Middle East policy,"
Said pointed out, "are Bernard Lewis and Fouad Ajami. Bernard Lewis
hasn't set foot in the Middle East, in the Arab world, for at least 40
years. He knows something about Turkey, I'm told, but he knows nothing
about the Arab world."

Lewis has developed a theory of "concentric circles" which seems to be
influential in Washington, but which Said and other critics take issue
with.

"This is the notion that the Middle East is divided into three circles:
an outer circle of deeply antipathetic regimes and anti-American people,
a second circle of pro-American people and anti- American regimes, and a
third inner circle of pro- American regimes and pro-American people --
that would be the Gulf. The others are Egypt, Jordan and Morocco for the
second, and Syria and Libya probably for the outer circle. In other
words, there's a non-homogenous Arab world, and it's the role of
American policy to change that so that it all becomes pro-American
regimes and pro-American people."

"Ajami has said many times that there will be flower-throwing on the
streets of Basra and Baghdad when the Americans are welcomed as
liberators. That's the world we're in. There's a deep contempt for other
ideas, certainly tremendous hostility to Europe, and to the large number
of American people and institutions, about which I wrote in the last
issue of Al-Ahram Weekly, which oppose the war and oppose such policies.
And, as far as I can tell, they're impervious because there's a fortress
mentality which is historically characteristic of cabals and putschist
regimes."

Scenarios for a post-war, most probably a post- Saddam, Iraq were also
part of the debate, as was the effect the war would have on the Arab
region.

Said: "I don't think the planning for the post- Saddam, post-war period
in Iraq is very sophisticated, and there's very little of it. [US
Undersecretary of State Marc] Grossman and [US Undersecretary of Defense
Douglas] Feith testified in Congress about a month ago and seemed to
have no figures and no ideas what structures they were going to deploy;
they had no idea about the use of institutions that exist, although they
want to de-Ba'thise the higher echelons and keep the rest."

"The same is true about their views of the army. They certainly have no
use for the Iraqi opposition that they've been spending many millions of
dollars on. And to the best of my ability to judge, they are going to
improvise. Of course the model is Afghanistan. I think they hope that
the UN will come in and do something, but given the recent French and
Russian positions I doubt that that will happen with such simplicity."

Iraqi scholar, Sinan Antoon, then pointed to reports that the cost of
the current war in Iraq, including humanitarian assistance, was
estimated to be 150 billion dollars, which would be paid from Iraqi oil
revenues and from frozen Iraqi assets. The opposition figures that the
Americans have lined up to take power have all agreed to that, meeting
with oil executives and agreeing to the privatisation of Iraqi oil.

Said doubted that things would be so simple, saying that it would take
years before Iraqi oil revenues begin coming in. "We're not talking
about three or four years, we're talking about now," he said. "There's a
major economic crisis. We went in a matter of a year and a half from a
budget surplus to a major budget deficit in the US, which is going to
increase exponentially over the next two years. There is no money. I
think the war is a desperate attempt to try to recover some confidence
in the economy and in the country. We're not talking about 150 billion
dollars from Iraqi oil, we're talking about a trillion dollars . The
calculations of the ten-year cost of the war go up to trillions."

Mursi Saad El-Din then asked Said whether the participation of the
British in the invasion, given their role in establishing the Hashemite
dynasty in 1917 and the original role played by Gertrude Bell in drawing
up the map of the region, would allow them to play a role in the
rehabilitation of Iraq.

"I have no information," Said responded, "but my opinion is that the
Americans want to do the whole thing. I don't think they want the
British or the UN. I think the idea is to do everything themselves and
maybe make use of British experts, but the serious work is going to be
done by the Americans -- the appointments to the ministries, running the
post-war government, etc. And the British [would] have a very small
role."

Senior Al-Ahram political analyst Salama Ahmed Salama asked Said for his
views regarding the conservatism of the current American administration,
and how he judged it. Was it just a passing phase?

"It's the worst administration I've seen since I went there in 1951. The
whole [conservative] trend is a very artificial one made up essentially
of three main currents. One is the Christian current, which is isolated
from the rest of the country. [But] it's a lot of people, 70-80 million.
This is George Bush's main constituency. Second, the neo-conservative
movement, which has been developing over the period since the end of the
1960s, as a reaction to the 1960s. But it is now narrower and narrower
and more focused. That's why you have people like [Richard] Perle and
[Paul] Wolfowitz in positions of power, because they've made an alliance
with the isolationist right wing within America. And these people are
toughened, especially after 9/11. They are right-wing, anti-immigration,
anti- diversity on the campuses and elsewhere, and they have a very
narrow constituency of fear and contempt."

"And the third group that feeds into this is the Washington
establishment, these think tanks in Washington which have taken the
intellectual class and turned them into policy salesmen who have no peer
review. I can now name maybe ten magazines that publish stuff which
nobody referees. They have become an entirely local group that feeds off
the government. And I think this is an extremely dangerous but in the
end dead-ended [group]."

"The opposition to the war is, I think, an opposition to all of that.
It's an opposition to the fundamentalists, who stand, for example,
against the theory of evolution. And these are the people pushing for
the war. And that's why I think the movement against the war, despite
the fact that it is flagging a bit because of loyalty to the boys and
girls abroad, as some of the Democrats are saying now, will grow. I
think that Bush will not have a second presidency. In fact, I and many
others are convinced that Bush will try to negate the 2004 elections:
we're dealing with a putschist, conspiratorial, paranoid deviation
that's very anti- democratic."

"This is why finally I think candidates in the Democratic primaries next
year will include people like Howard Dean, Dennis Kucinich, [maybe even]
Ralph Nader. I think those are very important things for us, especially
now given the war and what I'm sure will be its complications. I think
that's the role of the intellectual, to provide resources for hope. They
cannot be found in the conventional alleys of power."

"And don't forget, we have a very dramatic economic recession. With lots
of people out of jobs there's a wide perception that the social security
system is about to be privatised, and this war then becomes a kind of
folly. Bush is already spending something like two billion dollars a
day. Who's going to pay for this? I think that's why the French and the
Germans and the others' reactions are so important. [They] don't want to
be part of [the] so- called reconstruction effort. And look what they
did in Afghanistan. They didn't do anything. They bombed the place and
they haven't helped at all. So I think it's a very important moment for
this."

Aziza Sami pointed to a growing perception that the Arab regimes have
reached the "end of their history" in some sense, no one knowing what
will happen next in the Arab world. For many, the only option seems to
be a kind of people's movement, a reaction coming from the non-state
sector. In this sense she asked Said whether the formal Arab political
systems have really reached the end of their lives and whether there is
a way the Arab masses can begin to find new directions.

"I don't think anybody really knows the answer to that," responded Said.
"Regimes have a way of staying on, particularly in imperial moments such
as this."

However, Said drew attention to what he called a "very lamentable
emerging current in America and England" of neo-imperialism, the thought
that there is an acceptable and benign form of imperialism, as carried
out by the US. This, he explained, has even lead to revisions in the
history of the former British empire by historians such as Nial Ferguson
and David Armitage, who argue that the empire wasn't that bad, since it
brought order and certain countries benefited from it.

Said: "The advent of this new imperialism, with the cabalist or
putschist mentality that I believe exists in Washington, and with the
highly dubious results of the elections of 2000 in which Bush lost the
popular vote but got the presidency, has suggested to many people the
complete failure of American democracy. More and more people are
thinking in terms of direct democracy, such as on the streets, and in
terms of various alternative ways of looking at governance in this new
world with a single global power that has the ability to project
military power all over the world and carry on two, three wars at the
same time. For that's what the Rumsfeld vision is: not only preemptive
but also simultaneous war. In such a position, we're all in the same
boat, those of us who don't believe in that, whether American or not
American."

"And I would think the same thing applies here to the best of my
knowledge and ability to judge. That is to say, there's a failure of
rule. The powers that be in the Arab countries seem to be at best able
to keep down demonstrations, and so on and so forth."

"But I think there are enough movements from below, whether human-rights
movements, ecological movements, women's movements, ethnic movements,
that favour, in America, the disuniting of America, which is very
important. And maybe the same is true here. In other words, I think the
Westphalian system, which ordered the state system of the world, has
failed. And I think it's failed internally. There's been a desire on the
part of the right wing in the United States, since the Clinton
administration, to attack very heavily independent thought and anything
that appears to challenge the prevailing order, and of course this
increased after 9/11."

Political analyst Mohamed Sid-Ahmed pointed out that after 9/11, it
first appeared that the main confrontation was between imperial America
and terrorism. But something new has developed since then, reversing the
game. Mass movements that began with Seattle, the anti-globalisation
movement that has acquired global dimensions ever since, and Porto
Allegre, and the more recent demonstrations worldwide against the war in
Iraq, are changing the balance, putting the Bush administration on the
defensive. This is a phenomenon, he argued, that has widespread
implications, including the extent to which the image of Islam as
"terrorist" and "extremist" is being replaced by regimes claiming to
follow a moderate Islam.

Said concurred but added that the problem for outsiders was that what
meets the eye are the official regimes. "The rest of the world
identifies the Arabs with their regimes. There doesn't seem to be
anything else. And we haven't in the Arab world, I don't think,
developed a way of addressing these counter-currents in an organised or
at least in a significant way. After 9/11 there were the attempts of
groups, let's say of Egyptian intellectuals, who wanted to respond and
write letters and show that we're not all Osama Bin Laden. But that's
not quite the same thing. The problem is the regimes themselves, which
after all claim to represent their people. There's a crisis of
representation, which I think is difficult to overcome."

"What's very interesting also is the perception, and this is a footnote
to what Mohamed Sid-Ahmed said, that the opposition to the US in the
Arab world and Europe and elsewhere is not an Islamic opposition. It's
on a much wider basis, which is very important. I myself believe very
strongly that it's important for those of us who are not part of this
state system to be able to address what I call the 'other America',
because there are vast possibilities of mutual benefit, and Porto
Allegre is a terrific model for that."

The Palestinian predicament and events in occupied Palestine naturally
found their way into the discussion, eventually dominating the
roundtable. Mohamed El-Sayed Said raised several issues relating to
Palestinian nationalism, referring to the chaos that has characterised
the Palestinian Intifada since its inception, which "reflects the
increasing gulf between both the intelligentsia and the political elite
on the one hand and the new generations on the other, particularly in
the refugee camps in Gaza but also in the West Bank. I believe this is
an issue of grave concern given the immense sacrifice paid without, at
least until this moment, any real political gains."

He was also alarmed by how the Palestinian middle-ranking leadership had
lost its direction in the course of the Intifada: "You're having an
Intifada without a real head, and there is a question of how to restore
minds and reason in such a great act of resistance. Even the general
slogan of 'Intifada for Liberation', was exaggerated to the point of
suicide...Since you're actually asking Palestinians on their own to
complete the cycle and push forward to the end destination, you're
actually asking them to do something that they couldn't possibly do,
even in terms of numbers. Such chaos is disastrous when it comes to a
struggle," he insisted.

Finally El-Sayed Said raised the problem of finance. "Arab funding and
Arab money was a part of [Palestinian] corruption since the very
beginning. Now we know that the Palestinians need economic assistance
and help, so how can we possibly track or streamline economic and
financial assistance for the strengthening of the body politic of the
Palestinian community, the Palestinian national movement?"

Said was similarly uneasy about the militarisation of the Intifada, but
"one of the main elements in the creation of the mubadara [the
democratic initiative] of Mustafa Barghouti and Haydar Abdel-Shafi and
others, is precisely the issue of leadership of the Intifada and [its]
militarisation."

He conceded, however, that it was a sensitive issue for the Palestinians
since no one wanted to be seen to be capitulating to the Israeli
occupation, especially as Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon kept
making statements like "we want to break them." No one wants to just
give up, he explained. "The funny part of it is that there is no
instrument for giving way, for surrendering; we don't have even that
capacity. I mean Arafat has in effect surrendered, and nobody seems to
be interested. Which is why everybody is now looking for other ways."

"I think the question of money and new contacts has emerged from this
mubadara as well. There has been a great deal of European interest in
the mubadara precisely because it's led and represented by several
hundred people all of whom have reputations for transparency and who are
dedicated to their organisations, whether they're medical organisations
or relief organisations. That's very impressive."

"As for the gaps [referred to] between the camps and intelligentsia,
there are two other groups which are [also] extremely important: the
Palestinians who are Israeli, a million of them, and the shatat, the
diaspora Palestinians. Now, wherever you go there are people who say we
really have to organise ourselves and are beginning to do that. In
places like Britain there is a very strong solidarity movement. I think,
being basically anarchistic, it's working through other groups, like
divestment campaigns, anti-war campaigns, human-rights groups. Because
we can't deal with Israel and the US head on, they're just too powerful,
we don't have the means to deal with them. To me the answer is in the
emergence of an unconventional mentality that is willing to break with
all the old slogans."

Finally, the participants reverted to scenarios for post-war Iraq,
conceding that the picture was blurred. "I don't think anybody has any
idea," concluded Said. "All the available scenarios for the Middle East
that I've seen are full of suppositions. One writer whom I recommend to
your attention is Thomas Powers. He's the best writer on the situation
now. He's written an article entitled "The Man who would be President of
Iraq" for the New York Times and he thinks there's no doubt that once
[the American administration is] through with Iraq they're going into
Iran. If that's the case, if there's an attempt on Iran, who's going to
stop them from thinking the same thing about Syria? There are all kinds
of scenarios going around involving Israel. [The American
administration] wants a new friendly axis: Turkey, Israel and India.
That's the new strategic thinking. What is this going to do to the Arab
world with that kind of regime in Iraq? Those are the things that are
being discussed -- non-Arab dominance [in the Middle East]. A lot of
Iraqis, like Kanan Makiya, have been speaking about the 'de-Arabisation'
of the Arab world, not just of Iraq. I don't really know what to say
because everything could go wrong. I don't know what the war is going to
be like."

But will the Iraqi people remain submissive, Aziza Sami questioned. "I
don't know. I think they [the American administration] think so. Take my
words very literally: the [American] government has very few advisers on
the Middle East. The old Middle East people at the State Department,
[the Arabists] of whom maybe the last person is [Robert] Burns, have
been emasculated. They don't exist anymore, and they have no influence
at all. And the new people, like Thomas Friedman, don't know Arabic,
travel around the Arab world and are received in rooms like this and
give [the administration] advice about what the Arabs are saying and the
Arab street, and so on and so forth."

"As against that our voices are never heard. Al- Ahram Weekly is one of
the few things that people read, and it is having an effect, slowly. So
cowed and so frightened has the US press become that even when Robert
Burns gave his great Senate speech a month ago it wasn't reported. You
couldn't find it in the NYT. It's unbelievable, there's such an
atmosphere of fear, so the only thing left are the alternative radio
stations, alternative publications, and if you follow them, and
establish some kind of relationship, I think that's where the action is.
And that's why the Weekly is a fantastic resource. Many Americans read
it. They read your columnists as alternatives to what they get in
America."

I have about forty newish (80s & 90s) but rapidly acidifying issues of
Poetry Flash that I will give away to the first lucky (and nice) individual
who can pay for the shipping ($5) or who wishes to pick them up in person
(SF Bay Area) for free. I suspect these will be gone within the day, so act
fast. No questions about specific issues, please!

 but posting Edward Said's globbleglook is
insufferable..do you acturally READ this stuff,

Good point. If you're taking the Reichstag approach, than it may well be as you say. I still see Bin Laden as the one who sets the lure.

Even in a Reichstag scenario, Al Qaeda probably wouldn't willingly cooperate with the Bush regime. As the conspiracy theory goes, the Feds were complicit by not responding to the threat of attack, or- allowing it to happen.

The timing served them both. Who can really say- it's getting harder to distinguish between tyrants. The cover photo of Tariq Ali's THE CLASH OF FUNDAMENTALISMS, featuring GW Bin Laden says it all.

Petroleum Jelly Kids Cover the White House Via Monument Valley
(Gothic News Service, 03/31) The Petroleum Kids Studio =AD a breakaway branch
of the sculptor Matthew Barney=B9s infamous film crew =AD is reported about to
complete a ten-minute work for Network News television. Filmed by the Studi=
o
at night on location in Monument Valley, New Mexico =AD site of numerous
cowboy features, including John Ford=B9s "Stage Coach" =AD the Newscast feature=
s
the White House=B9s War Counsel. Framed against one of the Monument=B9s most
dramatic high-rise cliffs, the white petroleum greased theatrical set
included elaborate multi-platform scaffolds, thick ropes and pulleys, a
razor sharp, leather bull whip, a free wheeling Bradley steel tank tread,
and an illuminated empty missile tip. Dressed in transparent body suits =AD
also thoroughly greased in white jelly =ADmembers of the President=B9s War
Counsel are filmed in an intense workout that is designed to revive the
Administration's commitment to roll over Iraq in an ideologically consisten=
t
and timely manner.=20
   Consistent with the work of Matthew Barney =AD a Studio statement reads -
the Petroleum Kids=B9 work leaves no doubt as to the ambiguities of the power
relationships within the Counsel. Vice President Cheney, while being raised
and lowered from platform to platform, cannot stop rubbing large gobs of
petroleum jelly into his heart. War Secretary Rumsfeld =AD while held upside
down by General Tommy Franks =AD repetitively applies little dabs of the jell=
y
lubricant to the muscles around his squinting eyes. At the same time, the
General appears to use his feet to tightly enwrap the War Secretary inside
the grip of the loose and greasy tank tread. Running up and down the ladder=
s
between scaffolds, Condoleezza Rice, National Security Adviser snaps the
whip with a grace and ease, the white tip apparently stinging each Member i=
n
sensitive places in ways that cause their torsos to wince into rigid and
freshly familiar postures. Only the President is spared the whip. Through
out the sequence, while embracing a white missile tip, he struggles not to
fall off a western saddle that is raised and lowered up and down the cliff
by a barely stable, but well-oiled leather harness. Ironically General
Collin Powell appears wrestle with Richard Perle and Paul Wolfolitz in a
jelly mountain at the bottom of the set.
   Back in New York, the Petroleum Kid=B9s reported great satisfaction with
the first round of edits. Today=B9s film studio statement went on to say, "Th=
e
use of malleable use of the white petroleum jelly in the Western context is
perfect for showing the War Counsel=B9s slippery oscillations between covert
and overt behavior. As a Studio we realize it as our public duty to
dramatize and envision the ways in which the forceful members of this
particular group=AD especially in light of battleground realities =AD are
working to regroup and reframe the invasion and mastery of Iraq."  At Press
time it is not known whether or not the News Feature will achieve domestic
distribution by any of Networks, however worldwide exposure appears a sure
opportunity with much international interest immediately expressed.
   The National Monument Park Service =AD when asked - reports that no props
were found on the reported film site. "We did find some odd white filaments
of what looked like grease or jelly at the bottom of one the cliffs. Nothin=
g
serious. It did not seem to have anything to with making a cowboy movie, bu=
t
we did pause to wonder if some Native American Church Group had secretly go=
t
in here to re-enact a version of The Ghost Dance. The remnants did have a
scary, ghostly look about them."

Subject:      new books by Susan Howe
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

Just passing on this note from Richard Deming:

I just wanted to pass on information of 2 fantastic
editions of Susan Howe’s work that might get
overlooked.  These two collections are being produced
by Simon Cutts and Erica Van Horn at Coracle, one of
the finest small presses in the world and the books
are possibly the two best looking overall of Howe’s
work.  Since the books are so well crafted they are a
little more expensive than trade editions, but they
are still well below other what most fine press would
cost.  The books continue Howe’s meditations on the
ways that childhood fictions and material culture
shape memory via the texts of family photographs,
marginalia, and juvenile novels with photographs by
Peter Hare woven into the text.  Since there will only
be a relatively small number produced it’s best to
order sooner rather than later—and because Coracle
doesn’t work through a distributor you’re unlikely to
come upon the books unless you order directly.

Here’s the details on the books:



Susan Howe Kidnapped

Edition of 300 with 100 hors commerce copies.  Signed
and numbered.
96 pp off-set with tipped in 4 color images,
interleavings and facsimile bookmark.  Casebound with
wrappers.

$60 plus $5.00 Shipping and packing (or 55 Euros with
5 for shipping)



Susan Howe BedHangings II
Edition of 300 numbered copies.
48 pp letterpress Casebound with indented cover image.
$32 plus $5 for packing and shipping (or 55 Euros plus
5 for shipping).

Cheques payable to Coracle Press with order.

Subject:      Arm Amerika !!
MIME-Version: 1.0

Arm Amerika !!


A number of people here fully expect Bush and other National-Capitalists
to declare either a STATE OF EMERGENCY or MARTIAL LAW, come the 2004
elections. As far as I know this would be unprecedented in this country;
it would effectively forestall or cancel them! Bush's sense of absolute
rightness, use of force, and so-called Divine Guidance - coupled with a
devoted and private non-draft (professional) army, is almost a guarantee
of success. The religious Right - which has at times been suspicious of
Congress itself - would be pleased; it's hard to imagine a resistance from
a disarmed Left.

At the moment, the Courts are his; Congress is his. The Courts would agree
with martial law; Congress would be irrelevant. There are enough troops to
go around. Seize the Stock Exchange! The TV networks! Register everyone!
Export the Arabs! The Jews!

What to do? If this scenario occurs, Amerika will not be stopped, at least
for the foreseeable future. The only reason we are "bombing Baghdad back
to the stone age" is because of Congress and other limited resistance. And
who is to say we are not doing this? And who is to say that martial law
has not already been declared - is already underway?

It's surprising that this paranoid scenario is not being taken seriously
at this point; people whisper and wait. And for what? By the time the
"state of emergency" is evident, even to "ordinary citizens," resistance
would be futile! A fate or fact accomplished! A coop of state!

Consider the parallel with late Weimar - right-wing loyalists supporting
dubiously-elected leaders, deep collusion with the corporate and private
sectors, anti-semitisms, issues of lebensraum, marching columns, new
technologies of war and propaganda, technologies of censorship and con-
trol, faltering economies, absolutist leaders, nativist and fundamentalist
sympathies! The similarities are unnerving!

Should we begin to arm? To organize alternatives to a problematic Net?
(Fidonet, wireless networking, etc.?) To create disinformation campaigns?
To create the phalanx? The fifth column? The resistance? The escape-route
from the Camps? Sabotage? Wreckers? The Underground? The Underground
railroad? The assassination-squad? The death-squad?  Should we contact
other groups? World-wide? Which other groups? Should we import guns and
psychedelics? Export rhetoric? Testimony? Should we emigrate? Proclaim our
innocence?

Or should we be led like sheep to the slaughter !!

You have been invited to interact with the BABYLON MINISTRY OF
MISINFORMATION

"impersonate peaceful truths, reconsider violent non-objectivity"


  CognateOfUr

It has been brought to the attention of the proto-civilians of the
region of the Tigris-Euphrates that at the event of the 21st Century AD
much of our culture's 5000 plus years of future invention & evolution
of civilization will be lost, forgotten, erased, appropriated, burned,
americanized, exploited, & trampled on.  In 3000 BCE The BABYLON
MINISTRY OF MISINFORMATION had the vision to initiate a node to witness
& remember the fragments of glyphs, signs, letterforms, ledgers,
tablets, proclamations, lyrics & texts which repeated
Expansionist-Nations will seek to overthrow.  We are seeking the
inventive actions of all artists & poets of the future to help remember
WhatCouldBe .

"Founded in AD762 by Abu Jafar al-Mansur, the second Abbasid caliph,
the city of Baghdad was originally built on the west bank of the Tigris
River.

Circular walls enclosed the city and, although its original name was
Madinat as-Salam (City of Peace), it was more popularly known as the
Round City."

"Whatever Iraqi civilians - and soldiers for that matter - who die by our
bombs, they will soon know, bless their souls, that we bombed them to save
them." John Ashcroft, United States Attorney General.

Is this a malicious joke, or did he, or could Ashcroft actually have said
this in private, or, at least, in the privacy of his church? It does not
sound like anything he could have said publicly without risking a huge
international embarrassment for this nation's stated war objectives, suspect
as many already consider those themselves to be. Does anybody know the
source of this other than sometimes questionable cyber roots? The way US
planes are ruthlessly attacking Bagdad, I begin to wonder the motives of
anything in this Administration's deck.

and after sucking dry the hourglass feeder
I was a narrow aisle
of learning

and U Eco: If two things are similar,
the one can become the sign
for the other and vice versa.
... The word pig is neither similar
to a swine... nor to Noriega or Ceauscescu
[but] I can use the word pig to designate one
of the above mentioned gentlemen.

and W Benjamin: this amazement that the things
we are experiencing are "still"
possible... is *not* philosophical
...unless...
the view of history
which gives rise
to it is untenable.


thus Sara de Ibanez, Isla en la tierra

Al norte el frio y su jazmin quebrado.
Al este un ruisenor lleno de espinas.
Al sur la rosa en sus aereas minas,
y al oeste un camino ensimismado.

Al norte un angel yace amordazado.
Al este el llanto ordena sus neblinas.
Al sur mi tierno haz de palmas finas,
y al oeste mi puerta y mi cuidado.

Pudo un vuelo de nube o de suspiro
trazar esta finisima frontera
que defiende sin mengua mi retiro.

Un lejano castigo de ola estalla
y muerde tus olvidos de extranjera,
mi isla seca en mitad de la batalla.

in/trans by Inez Probert:

To the north, the cold and its broken jasmin.
To the east, a nightingale full of thorns.
To the south, the rose in its subtle abundance,
to the west a pensive road.

To the north, an angle lies silenced.
To the east, weeping arranges its mists.
To the south, my tender packet of fine palms,
to the west, my door and caution.

Maybe the flight of a cloud, or a sigh,
might trace this frontier that defends
my retreat bravely.

A distant wave of punishment explodes
and gnaws at your strange forgetfulness,
my dry island in the midst of the battle.
