Hello!  I'm very excited about my new book A Beautiful Marsupial
Afternoon (Wave Books, 2012).  The cover was just finished and can be
seen with sample pages at this link:

There are 7 billion people on Earth, meaning I don't take for granted
that someone wants to publish my poems!
All my best,

Yes to Adam Tobin. YES!
=20=20
And may I piggyback on his spot on observation to also address editors of=

journals, online and print.=20=20

I know most of you know this, so please don't get your panties wringered,=

but in addition to putting out CFWs and making selections, editors must
replicate on the page or online (kindle & co. too) the
poem(s)/stories/captions/essays/memoirs/scathing reviews. This can take
time, as author and editor may use different word processing programs or
even choose to make linebreaks by way of =93Enter=94 rather than =93Shift=
 Enter=94
or v/v =96 and that difference can make for more work on the editor's end=
, but
it is the job of the editor to do it, check, check when the designer (if
there is one) returns the doc.  "Editor" is an umbrella term and most
definitely includes all sorts of scut work.  It's how I most often earn a=

living when I earn a living which isn't as often as I would like; and I d=
o
not work in publishing.  Responsibilities have included checking links,
writing heads, formatting heads and titles and text; verifying words (2
words or 30-page document) against the original document (round after rou=
nd
after round) to make sure no words or images were dropped; back and forth=
ing
with the writer (and in my experience writer means everything from a
creative writer as we on the list are inclined to think of writer; to eag=
er
newcomer; to professional columnist; to a team in an ad agency; to a clie=
nt
who may be halfway across the country in a board room) to make sure the e=
nd
product is what the end product is supposed to be.  For me, editing has
meant soliciting articles and authors or culling through submissions;
working nights and weekends (sometimes) conventionally editing text and
entering it into PageMaker (to date myself, which I do, often). It may so=
und
like I'm preparing to tell you about the time I walked through the snow w=
ith
a printing press on my shoulder and the reluctant advertising and
circulation team on the other shoulder but I will save that for another
email.  (I've worked for a small literary journal; nonprofit monthly
newspaper (editor-in-chief); huge impressive magazine empire--the online
version thereof; in finance and law; advertising; probably other). Editor=
 is
NOT synonymous with MFA. Although as far as I'm concerned, reading and
commenting on 130 papers a week, if intelligently and helpfully done (and=

not just those comments which help no one) is a lead in to editing though=

I've never been able to convince anyone in the mainline for-profit work
world of that. As another editor where I'm currently working said, "I kne=
w I
was editor when I was in junior high school." It can be as strong a calli=
ng
as being a writer. Some are both. Not everyone. They are different callin=
gs,
like acting and directing.

I've heard blow-by-blows from a friends in the big publishing houses
including the most literary; their hours are long and the work intense. M=
ost
editors are means of production owned/controlled by publishers who won't =
be
reading this wee diatribe as they are on a beach chair on Montauk or Mali=
bu.

THAT SAID, even the most dandyish and self-annointed editors can expect A=
T
LEAST ONE VIRGIN AWAITING THEM IN HEAVEN if they promote poetry.=20

Eyebeam blog

As a resident of Eyebeam, I'm going to be blogging on their site,
http://eyebeam.org/blogs/alansondheim/ - you might want to check it out.
My project involves thinking through avatars and virtuality in relation to
pain, wounding, and death - how these may be manifest in virtual worlds
and how they may affect real, physical worlds.

This is compounded by the state of my father, who, we found out today, is
dying, and who has had a difficult and painful relationship with me from
my beginning. I have never been able to 'shake' death, to 'shake' thinking
about death; there are times I feel that I'm in a permanent state of
collapse as a result. So the coincidence of the start of the residency
with my father's state is both unnerving and painful, everything comes
together, falls apart, in the blog.

Hugh Fox: Way, Way Off On His Final Road
By Doug Holder
=20
***From the introduction of =93 Way, Way Off the Road: The Memoirs of The=
=20
Invisible Man=94 by Hugh Fox ( Ibbetson Street Press)

"Several years ago the Ibbetson Street Press published a Hugh Fox poetry=20=

collection =93Angel of Death.=94 I had never actually met Fox in the fles=
h, but I=20
was aware of his substantial contributions to the small press over the pa=
st 40=20
years. Fox was a founding member of COSMEP, ( a seminal small press=20
organization), a founding member of the PUSHCART PRIZE, and edited the=20=

groundbreaking anthology =93 The Living Underground,=94 to name just a fe=
w=20
achievements.

One day, in my apartment on Ibbetson Street in Somerville, Mass. I was ju=
st=20
about asleep when I heard my doorbell ring. I went to answer it and a man=
 of=20
a certain age, with long gray hair spouting from the sides of his cap and=
 a=20
heavy Bronx accent said: =93 Hi Doug, what do ya=92 have in there a Blond=
e?=92 I=20
said: =93Well my wife is here, she=92s sort of blondish.=94 I asked him i=
n but I guess=20
he sensed I was in no condition for company. He declined and promptly too=
k a=20
cab back to his hotel.

Since then I have had the opportunity to meet him on a couple of occasion=
s.=20
Fox is full of anecdotes about many of the stumblebums, poets, poseurs,=20=

publishers, editors, with all their infinite variety, on the small press =
scene. I=20
am glad this manuscriopt has seen the light of day. And when you read it=20=

hopefully you will see the light too."

--Doug Holder (2006)

I don=92t remember when I first became aware of Hugh Fox. He was a prolif=
ic=20
writer across all genres. It might have been through one of the many revi=
ews=20
he wrote for the Small Press Review; it might be from the manuscripts he =
sent=20
me to publish, or through the many poets of the =93Invisible Generation=94=
 ( A=20
term he used to describe his peer group of writers) he befriended over th=
e=20
years. Whatever you say about Fox, he wasn=92t a clich=E9 of a man=97he w=
as a=20
total original. He was a PhD with a big disdain for the academy; his brea=
dth of=20
knowledge left me breathless; he could be incredibly kind and incredibly =
rude,=20
but I loved him warts and all=97-hey ain=92t that what love is afterall?

I asked Fox a few years ago what he would like to be remembered for. He=20=

told me: "That I reminded people to take a close look and engage the worl=
d=20
around them.=94 Fox took it all in: from sex, the Aztecs, religion, the m=
eaning of=20
being, the meaning of meaning=85you name it.

He was a firm believer in the small press=97not the New York publishing h=
ouses=20
where the buck is the bottom line. It was his religion, his passion, to r=
eview=20
the thousands of small press books of all genres for the late Len Fulton=92=
s=20
Small Press Review, and other publications. To Hugh, the chap, or the big=
=20
tome was all high holy. Nothing was too obscure, too raw. He called many =
a=20
writer a =93genius,=94 but what I think what he really was tring to say h=
e=20
recognized the genius in all of us.

He took many a writer under his wing. He could be unapologetically flirta=
tious=20
but more often that not he would charm the pants off you=97and in his you=
nger=20
days I am sure he literally did. Hugh had a huge cadre of writers that we=
re=20
the objects of his affection.

He introduced me and countless others to the short form or capsule book=20=

review. In one of his short reviews he could really get to the core of th=
e book=20
with an economy of words, and he nixed the deadening academic jargon that=
=20
could bleed the life out of any writing.

I would get unexpected calls late at night from Fox. He would say: =93 He=
y I=20
miss you pal=97why haven=92t you called?=94 When I was laid off of my job=
 of many=20
years he offered to put me and my wife up at his home in Ann Arbor; he=20=

lobbied for me to be included in the important avant-garde poetry antholo=
gy =93=20
Inside the Outside.=94 Fox told me he loved me more than once=85 and you =
know=20
what?... I truly think he did.

I thought that Fox would never die. He told me for years he was on his la=
st=20
legs with cancer, and his time was short. He even wrote a play that conce=
rned=20
him and the noted small press poet Lo Galluccio, meeting cute while in th=
e=20
throes of ovarian and prostate cancer. To my knowledge Galluccio has neve=
r=20
suffered from ovarian cancer, but she was a dear friend of Fox and he=20
included a lot of us in his work.

As Samuel Beckett wrote: =93 We are born astride the grave,=94 and Fox is=
 gone.=20
He died in a hospice in Michigan at 79, heavily sedated, out of pain fina=
lly,=20
drifting up into the ether in a dream=97to the cosmos=97to that grand poe=
m=97
infinity.

I'm pleased to announce the latest title from SAY IT WITH STONES (an
emanation of Interbirth Books): j/j hastain's _long past the presence of
common_!!!

To learn more & to purchase, please visit
http://sayitwithstones.com/?page_id=3D333

_long past the presence of common_ is a revolutionary document -- a
collection of poetry, collage, and scripts that challenges a political
stability premised on always already repressive and hypocritical social
norms and practices. This work takes strategies of categorization,
simplification, and reduction to task for their failure to acknowledge th=
e
fundamental instability and unpredictability of organic energy and, in th=
e
process, it unleashes a radical assault on psycho/sexual conservatism,
cultural conventionality, and spiritual stasis.=20

long past the presence of common by j/j hastain
poetry / LGBT studies
87 pages
paperback (perfect bound)

With all the needless controversy surrounding BlazeVOX that we've seen rece=

"Excuse me=2C what was the question=2C" Mark DuCharme asks coyly in this in=
 this=2C his fourth collection.  Yet don=92t expect any easy answers=2C bec=
ause these edgy lyrics aren=92t about to give them.  Instead=2C the book pr=
esents a =93reflecting=2C sexy discourse=2C=94 a poetics of often intimate =
response=2C an entanglement with the phenomenal world which insists always =
on the pleasure of reading as a value in its own right.

"Enter a shimmering=2C wavering=2C vacillating=2C crinkly reality=2C the my=
sterious acrobatic disjointing of what you thought you knew. Enter Mark DuC=
harme=92s Answer=2C where the self-evident succumbs to the agnostic as a wi=

I also wanted to announce a couple of upcoming readings to launch the book:
On Monday=2C September 19th I'll be reading in the "So=2C You're a Poet" se=
ries at the Laughing Goat Coffee Shop=2C 1709 Pearl Street=2C Boulder=2C CO=
.  I'll be reading with Laura E. Wright=2C author of Part of the Design and=
 co-editor (with Anne Waldman) of Beats at Naropa.  The featured reading st=
arts at 9 p.m.=2C and is preceded by an open reading at 8:00.
On Wednesday=2C October 26th I'll be reading at 7 p.m. at Innisfree Poetry =

I hope to see you there!

SMALL PRESS COLLECTION AT ENDICOTT COLLEGE=20




BEVERLY, MASS.


Doug Holder, Adjunct Instructor of English and head of the office of the
Ibbetson Street Press at Endicott College (Beverly, Mass.) has started a
small press book collection with the help of Brian Courtemanche Director =
of
Endicott's Halle Library, and his staff: Audrey Koke and Kristyl Roderiqu=
es.
Holder, a widely published poet, and arts editor of The Somerville News, =
has
long run his own lauded independent small press and literary magazine
"Ibbetson Street" from his home in Somerville, Mass. Holder has long admi=
red
the great small press collections at the University of Buffalo and Brown
University, and has always wanted to bring books of poetry, novels,
etc..from the vast and eclectic sea of independent presses from this coun=
try
and abroad to Endicott College. The Library's website now has a link to t=
he
collection:
http://www.endicott.edu/Academics/AcadResources/~/media/LibraryMediaLibra=
ry/PDFs/Ibbetson.ashx
and it will be updated twice a year. The books listed so far are only a
small portion of the books received.




We hope to have an extensive collection and we would love for you to be p=
art
of it. Send your donations to :

*Kenning Editions is pleased to announce the publication of /Some Math/
by Bill Luoma.*

In /Some Math/, the syncopations of poetry meet the (ir)regularity of
mathematical equations. Consider the "story problems" of high school
math class. When encountering the word "and," replace it with the
addition symbol "+." When encountering the word "of," replace it with
the multiplication symbol "x." Now reverse the process. The result is a
series of sound poems that both employ and interrogate the global
language of systems and networks. Astrophysics. Computer science. Short
tetrameters. Long dactyls. 9/11. US military strategy. The energy
pathways of acupuncture. The fish ladders of Gmail. The wires and
electrodes of torture. The swirling products of global capital.
Mathematician Benjamin Pierce called his field "the science that draws
necessary conclusions." You do the math.

Bill Luoma is the author of /Works and Days/, /Dear Dad/, /Swoon
Rocket/, and /Western Love/.

I have an great fall lineup of readings, starting with Grey Borders in
St. Catharines, Ontario, on Friday, September 23.

I=92ll be reading with Shannon Maguire, Aisha Sasha John, and Zorras
Multimedia Troupe=97a treat to be reading with these terrific poets! And
many thanks to Eric Schmaltz and Niagara Artists Centre for making
this event happen.

Then on to Toronto, Ottawa, Kingston, Washington DC, and New York. Details:
http://rogueembryo.wordpress.com/camille-martins-upcoming-events/

I=92ll have copies of *Codes of Public Sleep* and *Sonnets* at each stop
on the tour, but if you=92d like to get a copy now, just go to my
website, which lists clickable vendors for these books:

http://www.camillemartin.ca

I=92m doing all these trips by VIA Rail and Amtrak. There=92s nothing
better for writing than a window seat on a train . . .

Cheers!

Alan--

You must be going through a really difficult time these days.  Know that
I have been thinking about you.  It really doesn't matter how old one's
parent is.  They always die too soon, and if the relationship has been a
difficult one, there seems to be a second death as well: the death of
hope that the relationship will improve.

I hope you are taking extra care with rest and food during such a
stressful time.

best,
Martha

Hello!

Many thanks to Camiele White, who talks me up over at TheWriteGame (below=

"Paul Siegell is the epitome of someone who=E2=80=99s always seeking forw=
ard motion,
a means to move and expand."

Also, Ernest Hilbert recently published my *LARYNGITIS LIGHTS* over at

I hope this note finds you well.

Herso:  An Heirship in Waves
by Susana Gardner

Now available from SPD!

http://www.spdbooks.org/Producte/9780982573143/herso.aspx

"I don't know another poet so formally daring. Rebellious curlicue and lace
significant: the pages gleam with pleasure, finesse and audacious measure o=
f
human becoming. A consideration of feminine inheritance, rebirth paroled by
langue, a her(o)'s journey as decadently articulated as sea-froth. Find it
too pretty at your peril=97you'll get pricked by the fine point on this
punning"=97Catherine Wagner.

It=92s a pleasure to watch Susana Gardner stretch the language out to its f=
ull
wingspan, displaying the gendered presumptions that give it flight. Her
writing lines up =93our turmoils in filched onus rows,=94 then ships them o=
ut
via =93Rouged Ifs=94 and charged =93stutterance=94 toward =93a restless and=
 scattered
hopeful.=94 Herso is my her( o): froward, many-minded, multi-tongued. =97Ro=
dney
Koeneke

If Susana Gardner didn=92t exist we=92d need to invent her Right Now. You=
=92ll
want to travel with her, as sometimes you just want to wake up into languag=
e
in a red-gold way, hearing all the voices, where we=92re going. Like a self
picked up in echosound, flipping & flick-flacking. HD & Loy & Woolf & Barne=
s
suddenly re-born on a twenty-first-century beach. That continual discovery
of what it means to step out in to the day, the gift & adventure of it.
Herso rings with rich footsteps, archaic, playful, tongued.=97Carol Watts
*    *      *
Carolyn Forch=E9 calls Susana Gardner's first full-length collection, [ LAP=
SED
INSEL WEARY ], "an extended social lyric of longing that refuses isolation
because the 'grandmany' is all around, in ancestry and memory and books and
shared future.... This poetry is full of heart and intelligence." Geraldine
Monk calls it "Disturbingly beautiful" while Elizabeth Treadwell describes
the work as "architecturally wild and sturdy."

About the author: Susana Gardner is the author of the full-length poetry
collections HERSO (Black Radish Books, 2011) and [ LAPSED INSEL WEARY ] (Th=
e
Tangent Press, 2008). She has published several chapbooks, including
Hyper-Phantasie Constructs (Dusie Kollektiv, 2010) andHerso (University of
Theory and Memorabilia Press, 2009). Her poetry has appeared in many online
and print publications including Jacket, How2, Puerto Del Sol, and Cambridg=
e
Literary Reviewamong others. Her work has also been featured in several
anthologies, including 131.839 sl=F6g me=F0 bilum (131,839 keystrokes with

ON CHILD-GETTING AND CHILD-REARING (Fence Books, United States, 2007). She
lives in Z=FCrich, Switzerland, where she also edits and curates the online
poetics journal and experimental kollektiv press Dusie.

ALEPH NULL
http://turbulence.org/spotlight/alephnull
by Jim Andrews

Aleph Null is a new work of generative art I wrote in JavaScript using the
HTML 5 canvas tag. It's a visual piece and goes in some unusual, exciting
directions, visually.

The last year has mainly been one of 're-tooling', for me. I've been
learning JavaScript at a deeper level. And learning jQuery, jQuery UI, and
the canvas tag commands. Previously, I'd been using Director to create my
net art works. But that proprietary piece of software is almost dead.
JavaScript, on the other hand, is public, open source, and on the upswing.
Aleph Null is the first piece I've created after my year-long study of
JavaScript and related things.

I feel like there's some more territory for me to explore concerning the
canvas tag. But Aleph Null gets in there at some depth.

100 Thousand Poets for Change Organizes Largest Poetry Event in History=20

Number of Participants Worldwide Growing Daily=20

650 events in 450 cities and 95 countries will take place on September =
24 to promote environmental, social, and=20
political change. Poets, writers, artists will create, perform and =
demonstrate in their communities, and decide their=20
own specific area of focus for change within the framework of peace and =
sustainability, which founder Michael=20
Rothenberg stated, ".is a major concern worldwide and the guiding =
principle for this global event."=20

Bob Holman and Margery Snyder, in a recent article on About.com said, =
"the beauty of the concept of 100=20
Thousand Poets for Change is that it is completely decentralized and =
completely inclusive." All those involved=20
are hoping, through their actions and events, to seize and redirect the =
political and social dialogue of the day and=20
turn the narrative of civilization towards peace and sustainability.=20

Poetry demonstrations are being organized in political hotspots such as =
Madison, Wisconsin and Cairo, Egypt. Poetry=20
and peace gatherings are planned in strife-torn Kabul and Jalalabad.=20

In Mexico there are over 30 events, with 18 poetic actions in Mexico =
City, where poets as well as environmental=20
and political activists are hoping to encourage reflection and creative =
responses against systemic violence=20
through the written and the spoken word with day long street events, =
readings and workshops. More than a third=20
of these events are organized by collectives actively working towards a =
non-violent approach to solve the=20
country's most pressing problems.=20

To date there are over 260 events in the United States. There are 20 =
events statewide in North Carolina where=20
teacher/poets have mobilized to protest cuts in education funding. And =
along the Platte River near Omaha,=20
Nebraska, poets will be demonstrating against TransCanada's planned =
Keystone XL tar sands pipeline. More examples of events can be found at =
the 100 Thousand Poets for Change www.100TPC.org. Each=20
event organizer has an Event Location blog page on the website for =
posting, poetry, artwork, photos, and=20
video to document this global mega-event across national borders.=20

Immediately following September 24th all documentation on the 100TPC.org =
website will be preserved by=20
Stanford University in California, which has recognized 100 Thousand =
Poets for Change as an historical event,=20
the largest poetry reading in history. They will archive the complete =
contents of the website, 100TPC.org, as part=20
of their digital archiving program LOCKSS.=20

Founder Michael Rothenberg is a widely known poet, editor of the online =

Listening Sounding Writing: An Ecopoetics Workshop with Jonathan Skinner
September 29 to October 2


The Millay Colony for the Arts offers four-day retreat workshops on =20
Colony's sylvan setting. Each class includes twelve hours of workshop =20=

time, all meals, and ample time to work, ruminate and explore our lush =20=

natural surroundings. Private bedrooms and spacious private studios =20
are available for all participants.

Workshop Description: This workshop focuses on soundscape as an =20
approach to changing our writing practice. Listening and field =20
recording techniques will be integrated with writing and discussion, =20
around the following concerns.
A word is intervention in the whole design landscape. We stalk our =20
poems in the debris field, listen for what water does, once it hears a =20=

mouth open. Listen for what we cannot see or hear. =46rom the out to the =
=20
inside of other bodies, sounding with our own. Listening for the dead, =20=

in touch with the living. What wants to be heard in this world and how =20=

can we be ready to hear?

How can the inertial heft, the fact of our own perspective, be useful =20=

in its very limitations? Let=92s practice poetry as an ear to the earth. =
=20
=93The Orphic explication of the Earth,=94 wrote Mallarm=E9, =93impersonal=
 and =20
alive.=94 Listening also helps us know what to do, when we hear what we =20=

are listening for. It is usually something we already are doing. But =20
knowing so wakes us to how poetry matters, to better focus our =20
sounding and advocacy.

We=92ll meet outdoors, approach local soundscapes, translate bird and =20=

insect song, walk with our ears, and write out of deep listening. =20
We'll track sounds with Ak=92abal, Eigner, Howe, Johnson, Khlebnikov, =20=

MacLow, Neidecker, Patton, O=92Sullivan, Vicu=F1a, amongst others. In =20=

addition to poems (new or renewed) we=92ll try our hand at field =20
recordings, and scoring/ writing sound walks.


Jonathan Skinner's poetry collections include Birds of Tifft =20
(BlazeVOX, 2011), With Naked Foot (Little Scratch Pad Press, 2009) and =20=

Political Cactus Poems (Palm Press, 2005). He founded and edits the =20
journal ecopoetics (www.ecopoetics.org), which features creative-=20
critical intersections between writing and ecology. Skinner also =20
writes ecocriticism on contemporary poetry and poetics: his essays on =20=

the poets Ronald Johnson and Lorine Niedecker appeared in volumes  =20
published by the National Poetry Foundation and by University of Iowa =20=

Press. His essays on urban landscape and poetics have appeared in Qui =20=

Parle (19.2) and in the Ecolanguage Reader (2011). Skinner is a =20
2011-2012 fellow with Cornell Society for the Humanities.

Workshop Schedule: Each day begins with a fresh breakfast followed by =20=

a three- hour workshop at 10:00 AM. Total workshop time for the =20
retreat will be twelve hours. The afternoon can be spent working in =20
the studio, visiting local sites, swimming in a nearby lake or walking =20=

the mountain trails. Dinner is served overlooking our gorgeous =20
meadows. Evening hours are devoted to worktime.

Fees: $600 includes tuition, private room, private studio and all =20
meals. $375 includes tuition and meals only. Workshop is limited to =20
seven participants.

Rodaan al Galidi is an Iraqi refugee living more than 10 years in =
Holland - where it rains a lot. We are now working on translations of =
his work:

Rain

Hey rain,
why do you fall here?
Are you blind, egotistical, are you crazy?
Why do you open umbrella=92s here
when you can open flowers there?

Thirsty seeds
wait for you
to rip through the darkness
and lay a shadow.
Naked branches,
beg woodstoves for one more day.
Rivers
try to recall the sea
and redness
dries on hands.

Rain
why are you a shower for green
when you can be her life?
Hey rain,
why do you fall on rain?


David Miller's Spiritual Letters (ongoing) has just been released in a =
full edition from Chax:

...letter by letter. Having no wish to be detained by clever =
fabrications, stories that might distract. A dark courtyard, a lecture =
on aesthetics. =96 And if art is only lies, for the sake of rapture and =
power? Facing the wall, away from the wind, she struck a match for her =
cigarette =96 the flame drawing my look. Feckless, volatile girl; in the =
dream she began shouting at me as I turned away from her. =96 Flung =
across the hospital room by the Holy Ghost, the musician said. A =
phone-call: the driver survived; he died =96 the friend I=92d stopped =
seeing. I thought of how he=92d insisted on reading poem after poem to =
me at dinner; I=92d looked (but not wanting to) at the spittle ejected =
upon his lip as he spoke the words. Faces of friends by my bed. Memory=92s=
 unquenched: her long hair that she tossed around her neck; her hand =
that reached for mine. Eye toward eye.... Slow phleboclysis (drop by =
drop; into the vein).



Louise Landes Levi will read from her translations of Simon Vinkenoog =
and Henri Michaux:=20

Everyone

wants to know abt. Michaux/  I already wrote

about him, but they want to know more,

2011 CHICAGO CALLING ARTS FESTIVAL
The Borderbend Arts Collective presents the Sixth Annual Chicago Calling
Arts Festival, a multi-disciplinary collaboration festival that happens
during Chicago Artists Month. During Chicago Calling, people in the =
Chicago
area work with people outside of Chicago -- both here in the U.S. and
abroad. These collaborations include a range of art forms, such as =
music,
dance, film, literature, and intermedia -- and they are prepared or
improvised. Some Chicago Calling events involve live feeds between =
Chicago
and other locations. Many Chicago Calling events also include =
partnerships
with local arts organizations and other institutions.

CHICAGO ARTISTS MONTH
Chicago Artists Month is a citywide, collaborative effort showcasing =
Chicago
visual artists and their work throughout the month of October.=A0 =
Coordinated
by the Chicago Department of Cultural Affairs and Special Events in
partnership with the Chicago Office of Tourism and Culture, Chicago =
Artists
Month showcases over 200 events, ranging from exhibitions to open studio
tours and neighborhood art walks presented by museums, galleries, =
cultural
centers, artist collaboratives, and other organizations throughout the
city.=A0 The primary goal of Chicago Artists Month is to raise awareness =
of
the extraordinary quality and depth of our visual arts =
community.=A0Explore
this site to see what happened during Chicago Artists Month 2010!

This year's theme, "Artful Networks,=94 explores the=A0communities that =
nurture
and inspire Chicago artists and their work.=A0 The people with whom =
artists
choose to work can be supportive in encouraging creative growth,
experimentation, dialogue=A0among peers, and community building.=A0 =
Ranging from
traditional residency programs to collaboratives to informal =
relationships,
our communities impact the way we create, support and appreciate art.=A0 =
In

A Book About A Candle Burning in a Shed
by Paige Ackerson-Kiely
$4

    :


	They called me down and I went down and arrived. My uniform was
	basically clean; a life alone makes the need for external
	demonstration almost disappear, but not fully. One thing I hate
	is when you get there and its all over. Like felled trees after a storm
	you have to cut up and drag them off the road. But not really the same
	thing. I knew it would be an important day when someone first hollered
	help in my direction. Mostly it is small jobs, unlocking cars and checking
	on the elderly. Sometimes they think I am their son and cry when I leave.
	Other times they are pretty much dead and I call the paramedics. None of
	the situations is good. I was north of town when the dispatcher crackled
	to me. Her clothes found in the river, hung up on some rocks, probably she
	got taken in the storm but I was still uneasy, even though nature is out of
	my hands, which should be a relief like it is to be a child and not a man.
	Beside the river there was an old mattress and a womans swimsuit, the kind
	that was in style 5 years ago, with ties on either side of the leg
	openings that you cinch or relax, depending on company. Waters high and
	full of silt, and it smelled like squash bugs and my ex-girlfriends neck
	when she worried about money. There was never enough of anything but I
	guess I got used to it. She was still beautiful from a distance and always
	in my memory delivered on a soft cloud. I didnt make a grab for her shirt
	as it drifted away, there on the banks, sun as bright as Id ever seen it.
	I was afraid to be pulled under.

Please join us to hear NICK DEMSKE and MATT HART read in 40 Irvin, =
Monday, September 19, at 8pm. Nick is an astonishing young poet and =
performer who read at an open mic session at the post_moot convocation a =
couple of years ago and blew everyone present away. We are also lucky to =
be able to host Cincinnati poet MATT HART, a terrific performer and poet =
with a national reputation, as a late and welcome addition to the =
ticket.
* * *

Nick Demske lives in Racine, Wisconsin and is a librarian at the Racine =
Public Library. His self-titled book Nick Demske was selected by Joyelle =
McSweeney for the Fence Modern Poets Series Award in 2010 and was chosen =
as one of the year=92s top 10 books of poetry by a Believer Magazine =
reader survey. Visit Nick at nickipoo.wordpress.com.

"Nick Demske writes from culture like the Hollywood version of a =
rebellious slave, the role shredding off him, culture's synthetic =
exemplary tales shredding and piling up on the floor of the projector =
room."=97Joyelle McSweeney

* * *=20

Matt Hart is the author of Who's Who Vivid (Slope Editions, 2006), Wolf =
Face (H_NGM_N BKS, 2010), and Light-Headed (BlazeVOX, 2011), and various =
chapbooks. His fourth full-length collection of poetry, Sermons and =
Lectures Both Blank and Relentless, will be published by Typecast =
Publishing in 2012. The founder and editor of Forklift Ohio: A Journal =
of Poetry, Cooking, & Light Industrial Safety, he teaches writing and =
aesthetics at the Art Academy of Cincinnati.=20

"In Matt Hart's poetry, crackling diction and soulful exuberance take =
the wheel for a happily bent ride through waking and dreaming spaces. =
Hart works the contours of his chosen forms with precision and humor, =
and emphasizes reoccurrence as poetic value and material dynamic through =
which to channel further depths of possibility for the =
imagination"=97Anselm Berrigan

Here is a series of 89 screenshots from Aleph Null:
http://vispo.com/aleph/jim . They're mostly 1920x1080 though some are
smaller.

These screenshots show you how Aleph Null can look with a little patience
and experimentation.

Aleph Null is an interactive, generative piece I wrote in JavaScript. It's
at http://vispo.com/aleph

The idea of the interactive Aleph Null is color music. It's a kind of a
game. The goal of which is to experience color music and create something
you like to look at.

I think those screenshots stand up with screenshots of any computer
generated art I've seen.

	Future Bakery: Interim Report

	1.

	Tumble awake, this morning. Start from fragments. A gauntlet. Urge
	others, speak slowly, more. Unity precedes. A cranial. Decline to
	leave names.


	2.

	Regular harbour, weave. Brunswick House, girlfriend. Ease down like an
	astronaut. What brief integrity, dialed. Composure governs. I pull my
	soldiered hands, small fortunes.


	3.

	Children, the frame. Agency of water, fresh and unremarkable, rare.
	Brace, with low chairs. The sun strikes everything, rattling plastic
	clouds. Who is this, really? Table this, divide.


	4

	Windspeck, taste of rain. Illusions in this distance, blue. Compulsive
	fingernails. Battered, cleared and crawled. Hotel concordance, congress.
	In passing, spark tongues. Suppress. These rooms are legion.


	5.

	Mechanical lineage. By the way, no longer. Sorry flightless birds.
	Submit is not the word. The right lane ends. All these coloured
	pencils. A shelf-life. Blueprint grit. She worries: where we cease
	to be.


	6.

	A corkscrew, distance. Impatient, leaf. Sweet fragrance. Hotel,
	sustains. Time changes colour. Coffee cools, and something moves.
	Synopsis: boundaries. Hips and dashed integrity. Relieved, we plummet.

"Peter O=92Leary was born in Detroit, Michigan in 1968...His books =
include Watchfulness, A Mystical Theology of the Limbic Fissure, Depth =
Theology, Wren/Omen, and Benedicite. In 2010, the Cultural Society =
published his third full-length book, Luminous Epinoia. He lives in =
Berwyn, Illinois and teaches at the School of the Art Institute of =
Chicago and for the Committee on Creative Writing at the University of =
Chicago. Vocations to poetry and religion have committed him to the =
pursuit of what St. Bonaventure named an itinerarium mentis in deum, or =
the journey of the mind to God, with particular attention devoted to the =
mystagogical-initiatic and the mytho-poetical." (O'Leary)

BAD DATE AMERICA is the Chicago event of 100 Thousand Poets for Change.  In=
 the spirit of community-building, guest curators Larry Sawyer and Lina Ram=
ona Vitkauskas are asking local poets to go on a hypothetical =E2=80=9Cdate=
=E2=80=9D with America.  Has your relationship with America started to seem=
 like a bad date?  See -- http://baddateamerica.wordpress.com

100 THOUSAND POETS FOR CHANGE is a global initiative of poetry readings, po=
litical demonstrations, community picnics, awareness events, and parades th=
at will take place in 450 cities across the planet on September 24, 2011 to=
 promote serious social, environmental, and political change.  See -- http:=
//www.100tpc.org

MESS HALL is a Chicago-based experimental cultural center and collaborated =
with Red Rover Series on Bad Date America.  Mess Hall is a place where visu=
al art, radical politics, creative urban planning, applied ecological desig=
n and other things intersect and inform each other.  They host exhibitions,=
 discussions, film screenings, brunchlucks (brunch + potluck), workshops, c=
oncerts, campaigns, meetings (both closed and open) and more.  See -- http:=
//messhall.org

RED ROVER SERIES is curated by Laura Goldstein and Jennifer Karmin.  Each e=
vent is designed as a reading experiment with participation by local, natio=
nal, and international writers, artists, and performers.  The series was fo=
unded in 2005 by Amina Cain and Jennifer Karmin.

CLEARVIEW/LIE by Ted Greenwald

Cover by Hal Saulson    193 pages

ISBN 0-935992-28-6         $16.00


Ted Greenwald was born in Brooklyn and raised in Queens.
He is the author of over thirty books, including 3 (Cuneiform Press,
2008), Permanent Record (LRL, 2008), In Your Dreams
(BlazeVox, 2008), and Two Wrongs (Cuneiform Press, 2007),
a collaboration with Hal Saulson.

"This autobiographical epic from American poetry's best-kept
secret dynamo goes streaming onward and veering between
electric poles and templates of "anyway," deep in the heart
of diction. The poem is a form of reading one life into another,
a bridge-and-tunnel work, swift and huge as capital letters."
Bill Berkson

"Ted Greenwald's CLEARVIEW/LIE is a memoir, of sorts--a portrait
of the poet as a young man gathering information and harboring
knowledge. This book can also be read as an ars poetica, though
nowhere does Greenwald make the mistake of confining it in a
summation. Offering impressions, observations, side-bars, "takes,"
propositions, he writes of things that have given him pause.
Greenwald keeps his account terse and yet its vision is capacious;
its tone is sardonic and yet it is informed by generosity of spirit.
It is about the grace of skepticism. CLEARVIEW/LIE affirms
the virtues of necessity. It's an account of getting real. We live life
where conditions are specific and things actual; these are the
limit conditions that provide a lived life with its creative
contradictions
and its adamant individuality, modest perhaps and certainly
magnificent."

Hello!

I find this a bit weird. Issue ten has all works by one writer, Christine
Choi. No other soul. Can anyone elaborate please?

'a document'

lived in this house from 1952-60, returned for short or long periods of
time over the next 51 years. so this was, after the cleaning, the final
stay, and because it, and the landscape and river and coal, figured so
much in my work, i took a last 'walk around the block' in the middle of
the night, talking about a departure-event which often passes unnoticed,
and so is hereby recorded. please forgive the maudlin, the sentimental;
given my state of mind, i was lucky to make the walk and recording at all.

thus 'a document.'

Hello friends,


 BRAVE MEN PRESS

(http://www.bravemenpress.com)

is pleased to announce to the release of


 MICHELLE TARANSKY's

new chapbook

NO, I WILL BE IN THE WOODS


 *"Yes, I will be in Michelle Taransky's words. I will call Michelle
Taransky into question. She says we are all addicted to evidence. Yes, I
will be in Michelle Taransky's woods. Michelle Taransky decided to make
these choices. And she says the word feverfew. No, it isn't as simple as
taking one o away and putting in its place an r. But I love how she gets me
to do this. These point the way, the way a slash on a tree in the woods
blazes a path. A hint, an inkling. I will go there to see what she says see.
And I'm pretty sure I'll be better off everafter*."

- *Dara Wier*, author of* Reverse Rapture* & *Hat on a Pond*


 *Michelle Taransky* is the author of *Barn Burned, Then*, selected by
Marjorie Welish for the 2008 Omnidawn Poetry Prize. Before moving to
Philadelphia to work at Kelly Writers House, Taransky received a BA from The
University of Chicago, worked as Programs Coordinator at The Poetry Center
of Chicago, earned her MFA from The Iowa Writers' Workshop, taught poetry at
the Iowa Young Writers Studio, and was a resident at Wave Books' Poetry
Farm. She is a member of the Critical Writing Faculty at Penn and an adjunct
poetry instructor at Temple University. Taransky is always happy to talk
about poetry, glitter, Charles Barkley, or her book-in-progress: Never Quit:
The Poetics of Charles Barkley.

INTERVIEW

   _The Art of Fiction No. 212 _
   Nicholson Baker
   =E2=80=9CI think I felt some of the terrifying arbitrariness that someo=
ne who=E2=80=99s
   writing a folktale feels=E2=80=94=E2=80=98Once upon a time, the old mil=
ler climbed a tree.
   No he didn=E2=80=99t, he dug a well. No, actually he swam out in the mi=
ddle of a
   pond and met a genie.=E2=80=99 It doesn=E2=80=99t matter. Who cares? An=
ything can happen.
   There are a hundred possibilities. But if you bring it very close to
   something you know, then the number of possibilities drops way down. An=

INTERVIEW

   _The Art of Fiction No. 213 _
   Dennis Cooper
   =E2=80=9CI think pornography is a very rich medium, and I=E2=80=99ve st=
udied it closely and
   learned quite a lot as a writer from it. Porn charges and narrows the
   reader=E2=80=99s attention in a swift, no-nonsense way, and it creates=
 an anxious,
   intimate, and secretive atmosphere that I find very helpful as a way to
   erase the context around my characters and foreground their feelings, t=
heir
   psychological depths, their tastes. But I=E2=80=99m also always interes=

   subverting and counteracting porn=E2=80=99s effect, and the sex in my b=

ESSAY

   _Some Notes on Translation and on =E2=80=98Madame Bovary=E2=80=99_
   Lydia Davis
   Not long ago, I was chatting with an older friend who is a retired engi=
neer
   and also something of a writer, but not of fiction. When he heard that=
 I had
   just finished a translation of _Madame Bovary_, he said something like,=
 =E2=80=9CBut
   _Madame Bovary_ has already been translated. Why does there need to be
   another translation?=E2=80=9D or =E2=80=9CBut _Madame Bovary_ has been=
 available in English
   for a long time, hasn=E2=80=99t it? Why would you want to translate it=
 again?=E2=80=9D
   Often, the idea that there can be a wide range of translations of one t=
ext
   doesn=E2=80=99t occur to people=E2=80=94or that a translation could be=
 bad, very bad, and
   unfaithful to the original.

ESSAY

   _Into the Zone_
   Geoff Dyer
   Tarkovsky is saying to the audience: Forget about previous ideas of tim=
e.
   Stop looking at your watches, this is not going to proceed at the speed=
 of
   _Speed_, but if you give yourself over to Tarkovsky time, then the

The link posted earlier for the Tullamore event should have been www.worldt=
v.com/poets_for_change_tv

Inaddition, Roma Media Film Productions have posted a video channell as par=
t of their contribution to the event featuring poems for and by Romany (gyp=
sy) peoples. Their website is www.romafilmfund.com

PREDA.org have also published online the poems of myself, Ken Hume and Anth=
ony Sullivan who preformed at a reading as a fundraiser for them in Open He=
art House in Dublin. Look for the Poetry link... (although held earlier tha=
n the Sept 24th date, its part of the Tullamore reading for the event...)

Those poems will also be on the poetry wall at the main event in Budapest, =
Hungary, so if your there... check it out!!!

Furniture Press Books is thrilled to release Old News by Ryan Eckes. You ca=
n
buy your copies at Furniture Press Books (furniturepressbooks.com or
http://furniturepressbooks.com/books/eckesoldnews/). Just follow the signs!

Eric Baus says

*Old News* is a real city. Many persons on the pavements. A picture teacher=
.
A brief history of Spirit-matter. A brief history of a lost dog. Total
Assets: a flash card with the word *friend* on it. Professional History:
picking through the garbage with Gabriel Garcia Marquez. Often it is
permitted to return to a factory. A car goes by and it doesn=92t explode.
What=92s it say to all these dead people? White House for rent, 2 bdrms 1
bath.
And Stan Mir states

What immediately strikes me about *Old News* is the commingling of
journalistic brevity with everyday vernacular. This combination naturally
pulls irony to the surface, which is refreshing in an era when popular
culture=92s version of irony bombards us. Oftentimes, pop culture leads us =
to
believe that irony isn=92t natural and must be produced for us in the form =
of
a sitcom. In turn, this manufactured irony makes it harder to discern true
irony when we encounter it. *Old News* is journalism - objective and
informative - but it is journalism written by someone who knows, whether it
is 1923 or 2011, what=92s at the core of everyday life.

We had planned to do a reading for the 100000 Poets for Change event in Tul=
lamore, but a family illness on my part, and sheer lack of co-ordination me=
ant it did not come to be. While quering venues, our good friend Ken Hume g=
ot invitede to Culture Night in Edenderry, an annual cultural event in Irel=
and, held for the first time outside of Dublin.
=A0
And so we renegades of the Tullamore Rhymers Club decided to infiltrate the=
 event and merge ours with theirs, and so a day early we kicked off 100000 =
Poets for Change at the Culture Night in the Library in Edenderry in Co. Of=
faly... as you do!
=A0
The eveening started off with Irish traditional music from members of Edend=
erry Ceoltas (Irish music society) that featured a man and a number of youn=
g relatives on banjo / ukelele, accordians and a harp, the latter of which =
was excellent considering the young age of the harpist.
=A0
A talk, morelike conversation from Geraldine O' Neill about how she got int=
o writing stories and books kept all agog for a half hour or so, after whic=
h we had a break for more wine, skewered cheeses, salmon on crackers and ot=
her delicacies I could not recognise but ate reguardless. It must have been=
 the wine, but they tasted lovely reguardless!!!
=A0
After that Ken Hume read out poems about a local charachter here in Tullamo=
re, and another two poems, and read Anthony Sullivans 911 piece recently pu=
blished in the Midland Tribune.
=A0
Then his mother Triona read out two of her pieces to great acclaim.
=A0
She was followed by a local poetess Fionnula ? who had three evocative non =
rhyming poems, one on the loss of her sister as a child, and another on str=
eet signs of all things, and my favourite one, about the bog.
=A0
Being up next, I kept to the theme and read my poem "Walking the Bog", foll=
owed it up with "Out of Tune" before finishing up with "Fate and Faiths".
=A0
Geraldine O Neill took the stage again and gave tips about writing, afterwh=
ich the usual thanks to all was given by the county librarian and the libra=
rian of Edenderry, and we had a chat and mingled a bit before heading home =
from a very enjoyable night.

As 100000 Poets for Change draws to a close, I say a big YAY! to all who ha=
ve taken part. A small idea, a little belief, a big effort and a massive su=
ccess!!!!

As part of the Tullamore contribution, we wrote a series of poems to suit t=
he occasion, and the latest one I wrote is a haiku sequence (poem of multip=
le verses which are all haiku, non rhyming).

  "Occupy!" The Wall Street Occupation 2011 - A silent movie poem.=20

Before I sleep, Ill share a last video of mine based on the Wall Street occ=
upations this week. Its a silent one, unlike my normal poetry videos, feel =
free to share!!!

"Occupy" The Wall Street Occupation 2011

Wall Street was occupied multiple times by anti-capitalist and anti-globali=
zation protestors in the past weeks. These protestors get minimum coverage =
in the mainstream media, so it is left to viral news videos on YouTube and =
Indymedia, Twitter and Facebook to get the message out there, that at the h=
eart of the American financial system founded on Usury, there are people ob=
jecting, protesting and making their voices heard. They can ignore the peop=
le, but they cannot keep them silent. They can control where the people wal=
k on the streets, but they cant keep the people off of the streets.

I have had enough!
Bankers gamble with money: we
Pay with our lives...

We will be heard loud
Whose future is destroyed by them
Whose gain is our loss

Our tomorrow will
Be better, for we all now
Occupy today

We occupy here
Greedy capitalism's heart
We squeeze out its life

What's my job, you ask?
Fight injustice, for justice
That's all of our jobs!

Poets for Change has been quite an event!!! As Michael Rothenberg would say=
... "YAY"!

Hi All,

My Robert Duncan biography is in production with UCal Press and I still need
a few photos. Does anyone have anything in a private archive? Or have you
seen something good in a library archive? (I've already been through the
collection at Buffalo.)  I'm looking for unusual unpublished things.

Thanks,
Lisa Jarnot

Murat,

I'll tell them to give you a kiss on the cheek for me when they get =
there.

To all my other old friends, I'm back on the BuffPo list after five =
years or so . . . has anything changed?

The Claudius App, an online journal of negative reviews and poems, is now
accepting submissions for its second issue, deadline November 15th.  The
first issue, cached into eternity at www.theclaudiusapp.com, included work
by or attributed to: Charles Bernstein, Joshua Clover, Robert Fernandez,
Simon Jarvis, Kent Johnson, Francesca Lisette, Joe Luna, Marianne Morris,
Geoffrey G. O'Brien, Vanessa Place, Rod Smith, and Keston Sutherland.  In
addition to poems and negative reviews of contemporary books of poetry,
we're also potentially interested in negative reviews of groups of books,
groups of poems, magazines (including our own), aesthetic movements
(including our own), proleptic reviews of books yet to appear, redundantly
ad hominem obituaries, etc. etc.  Query editors@theclaudiusapp.com for
more information.

Please do be advertised that this is neither the Battlefield Where The Moon
Says I Love You nor The Balcony Where The Sun Says Good Morning.  The moon
in our bureau mirror will be delivered of neither pathos nor pity, is
against both labor and love and any preposition that might come between
them.  Spray paint made pointillism obsolete.  We're working on makeup
but will never quit smoking: any cancer's worth giving our loved ones
the opportunity for grand gestures.

Plutarch Lives!  As for your monthly Ode to the National Grid, we know that
pentameter rolls through all things, so take a number.  "The second
showerhead of your heavenly shower has been turned off in an effort to
conserve our most precious natural resource," but we'll sooner die with our
money in our pockets than step into that river twice.  May you meet us there
on the rocky banks, at the warier end of November, when our contrails will
return into snow.

within and among volumes. Encyclopedia Vol. 1 A-E was published to wide acc=
laim in 2006; Encyclopedia Vol. 2 F-K just launched new excitement in 2010.=

CUE Books is pleased to announce the launch of Species Branding by
Danielle LaFrance:

Saturday October 1st
7:00 â€“ 9:00 pm
Pulp Fiction Books
2422 Main Street @ E. Broadway
Vancouver, BC

"Abjection, translation, insurrection: in LaFrance's Species Branding
these coordinates give new garb to some of poetry's most enduring
idealisms and abstractions: beauty, desire, and friendship. No frame is
left uncatalogued. Every bastion of the bourgeoisie is stormed. Every wall
- every gender - is scaled. In other words,'revolution ends here, man.'"

Hey, folks,

An excellent interview. Eight poems. An artist's statement. Even a short
photo-essay on aesthetics. Thanks to Bill Yarrow, J.P. Reese, Nicholas Y.B.
Wong, and Lacey N Dunham for asking great interview questions. What a joy!
Life is good!

Subject:      Gale Nelson & Lori Baker: Saturday in Brooklyn
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable

Dear everybody,

This Saturday evening at 7:00, the poet Gale Nelson and the fiction writer =
Lori Baker will be visiting from Providence, and reading from their new pub=
lications at Unnameable Books. =20

Unnameable Books is at 600 Vanderbilt Ave., in the heart of Prospect Height=
s, Brooklyn NY. Take the Q train to 7th ave., or the 2/3 trains to Grand Ar=
my Plaza. =20

Gale Nelson is the editor & publisher of Paradigm Press, and the Assistant =
Director of Literary Arts at Brown University. His latest book, This Is Wha=
t Happens When Talk Ends, is recently out from Burning Deck.

Lori Baker has taught writing at Brown University, Boston College, and Whea=
ton College in Norton, Massachusetts and is the author of Crazy Water, whic=
h won the Mamdouha S. Bobst Literary Award for Short Stories.

Baker's new collection of stories, CRASH & TELL, is just out from Louisiana=
 State University Press. Harry Mathews says "This is superb writing and sto=
rytelling, ripe with unerring wit and grippingly unanswered questions that =
never failed to move me."

From the comical re-imagining of Jane Goodall=E2=80=99s life among the apes=
 -- told from the eyes of Jane as a debutante escapee -- to a professional =
research subject who outwits a cunning psychiatrist; a photographer must co=
me to grips with a peculiar family obsession; a bored wife on vacation expe=
riences an unexpected seaside interlude with a strangely menacing dentist; =
a car crash leads to the most unromantic of romances -- the alienated subur=
banites of these tales value memories (and ghosts) over people.

Nelson's new book, THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS WHEN TALK ENDS, contains 8 sets of =
8 poems: the poems within a set follow the vowel pattern of a particular pa=
ssage from Shakespeare. They could be called homovocalic translations thoug=
h they ignore Shakespeare's content while trying to build toward their own =
coherence. The poems are arranged in a chess pattern, the earliest survivin=
g knight's circuit, attributed to al-Adli ar-Rumi of Baghdad and presumed t=
o date from 840 A.D.

The reading may be outdoors if the weather permits, or down one flight of s=
tairs in the basement (not wheelchair accessible: sorry) if or the weather =
and.

The Borderbend Arts Collective presents the Sixth Annual Chicago Calling
Arts Festival, a multi-disciplinary collaboration festival that happens

Chicago
area work with people outside of Chicago -- both here in the U.S. and
abroad. These collaborations include a range of art forms, such as =
music,
dance, film, literature, and intermedia -- and they are prepared or
improvised. Some Chicago Calling events involve live feeds between =
Chicago
and other locations. Many Chicago Calling events also include =
partnerships
with local arts organizations and other institutions.

nine (2011-2012). The event will be

Below this note is our invite letter, which spells everything out. =20
Please backchannel any inquiries or

Hi,

David Kirschenbaum here. I=92m the editor and publisher of Boog City, a =20=

New York City-based small press and community newspaper now in its =20
21st year. I=92d like to invite you to take part in the ninth season of =20=

our =93d.a. levy lives: celebrating the renegade press=94 series.

The series is held at Chelsea=92s ACA Galleries (http://=20
acagalleries.com/), which is owned by the son-in-law and daughter of =20
the poet Simon Perchik. It=92s a nice space, and we fit 100 people, =20
including a nine-piece jazz flash orchestra, in it for Chax Press=92s =20=

event, with plenty of room to spare. The gallery provides wine and =20
other beverages, and cheese and crackers and hummus and chips.

Once a month I have a different non-NYC press host and feature three =20
or more of their authors to read (we=92ve had as many as 10 for one =20
press and usually have 3-6) for 60 minutes total. We also have a =20
musical act perform two 15-minute sets. If the visiting press is able =20=

to book the musical act that=92s preferred, so it=92s truly their night, =
=20
if not I can book one that I think will work well with the night. =20
(Also, once a year we play host to our NYC brethren.)

The series is held on the last Tuesday of each month at 6:00 p.m. If =20
you=92re game to partake, please let me know, in order, your top three =20=

date preferences. The following dates are available:


2011

Tues. Nov. 29


We started the series in August 2003. In our first eight seasons we =20
hosted:

MIME-Version: 1.0

Hello everyone,

We're following up last year's lovely conference with another this
year in May. Please come and join us in the redwoods! Some crazy
thinkng goes on out here.

Eireene

***
Emergent Communities in Contemporary Experimental Writing
May 4-5, 2012

Hosted by the Poetry and Politics Research Cluster, University of
California, Santa Cruz

This conference is organized around experimental writing and its many,
varying communities including performance art collaborations, small
press publishing and editorial projects, virtual and digital work,
academic affiliations, and intersecting aesthetic, social and
political identities and representations.  The goal of this conference
is to embrace the productive and generative connotations of community
and experiment as innovative acts and encounters that are always in
the process of both venturing to do something previously untried, and
questioning and testing the very boundaries and mores, however
contingent, established by those attempts.  Of particular interest is
how writing communities might be changing historically in the early
twenty-first century, and how writers theorize and make use (or not)
of various conceptualizations and practices of community. What do such
formations include and leave out? What are the conditions of
possibility for a community to emerge? From where does one emerge? And
into what? How are writing communities that share an often contested
collective vision themselves experimental formations for attempting
new modes of relation, affiliation and creation?

Confirmed respondents include: Tisa Bryant, Sueyeun Juliette Lee, Anna
Moschovakis, Vanessa Place, Juliana Spahr, and Ronaldo Wilson.

The call for papers is open to all writers and academics, and we
encourage proposals that continue to push the critical/creative
divide.  We welcome interdisciplinary papers that engage philosophy,
history, publishing, pedagogy, art and digital media. Conference
activities will include panels, round-table discussions and a small
press book fair.  Each day will culminate with evening readings of the
guest writers=92 creative work.

Please submit an abstract of 350 words to
ucsc.poetrypolitics@gmail.com by December 1, 2011. Individual speakers
will be placed on panels and allotted 15-20 minutes to present their
work. Panel proposals are also welcome. Selected papers will have the
opportunity to be published on a post-conference website and in an
edited volume of essays inspired by the conference. Please email
Andrea Quaid, aquaid@ucsc.edu or Juliana Leslie,
julianaleslie@gmail.com if you have any questions.
