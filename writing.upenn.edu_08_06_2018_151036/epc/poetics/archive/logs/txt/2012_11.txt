*CANCELLED:
Segue Reading Series* | *11/3
* featuring *STEPHEN BOYER* & *KATE ZAMBRENO*

We regret to report that due to the unfortunate post-Hurricane Sandy
circumstances in the city, Segue will cancel its 11/3 event.

We are grateful to report that readings by these illustrious writers should
be rescheduled at a later date (stay tuned). In the meantime, Segue will be
back with vengeance next Saturday (11/9), when we will feature P. Inman and
Michael Nardone! We do hope to see you there.

To the many affected by the storm, we send our warmest wishes for a speedy
recovery. Our thoughts continue to be with you, as we are in high spirits
for a weekend of relief-efforts and creative resilience!

yours,
Trisha Low and Holly Melgard, curators

Horace wrote: "Never a day* without a line of poetry" (*/cum grano
salis/ Election Day too).Cornelia Street Cafe, has, with Horatian
wisdom, invited the three of us to read, timing it so that those who

I just received The Poems of Octavio Paz, edited and almost entirely translated by Eliot Weinberger (with a handful of translations by Muriel Rukeyser, Paul Blackburn, Elizabeth Bishop, Denise Levertov and Charles Tomlinson). A huge selection of one of Latin America's most important poets. The translations are lucid and fresh, eloquent and unassuming--no star turns at the expense of the original. And it's bilingual. The product of decades. I can't recommend it more highly.

Cat.
Mark Cochrane
$3

	In the garden, haunches down
	like a library lion, Enid
	the grown kitten
	gently parts
	with paw, with claw,
	the feathers
	on some rare, yellow-breasted
	chat, exposing a belly
	she tears open
	with needle teeth &
	gory-sunwarm
        deliberation.  And standing
	at his French doors
	Felix is aroused
	to a horror.  Loving
	birds as he does--

published in Ottawa by above/ground press
November 2012
a/g subscribers receive a complimentary copy

Mark Cochrane lives in Vancouver, practises law, and teaches in the
English Department at Kwantlen Polytechnic University. He wrote Change
Room (Talonbooks 2000) a long time ago and Cat. not long after that.

The new ebook from Argotist Ebooks is =E2=80=9CWindows Without Dreams=E2=80=
=9D by Daniela Voicu.=20
=20
Description:
=20
=E2=80=9CWindows Without Dreams=E2=80=9D captures the sheer joy of living. =
Many of the poems are formerly delightful, dappled with quirky portmanteau =
words and turns of phrasing, which seem as natural as sunlight. Yet, this c=
ollection is not without its representations of sorrow; and there are poems=
 about lost love and failing relationships where, to quote from one poem, =
=E2=80=9CThe kissed memories of rainbow sentiments, salt wind and the sand =
storm, speak from my skin=E2=80=9D.

13 HOUR ELECTION DAY DISCUSSION/PERFORMANCE OF THE CONSTITUTION

Collaborative Art Group Lucky Pierre invites writers, scholars, artists, and activists to investigate:
What do you know about the US Constitution?

On election day November 6, 2012, during polling hours (6am to 7pm), art collective Lucky Pierre (www.luckypierre.org), Defibrillator Gallery and 24 guest presenters will work through this American project as defined by the United States Constitution.

We'll start at the beginning of the constitution "We the people..." and work our way through to the end - "The Congress shall have power to enforce this article by appropriate legislation." Drinks will, of course, be served after the 21st Amendment.

Each of the 24 guest presenters will present their findings as a 30-minute presentation / discussion / song / performance/ polemic. Each presentation will be followed by a group discussion. Visitors can come and go at any time throughout the day.  Findings and texts from the day are to be released in book form on Inauguration Day 2013.

Defibrillator Gallery

*Belladonna* is pleased to present:*



*IOVIS Reading*

*Thursday, November 15, 2012; 7 pm*

*Poets House, 10 River Terrace, NYC
*



A group/polyvocal performance from Anne Waldman's award-winning epic The
Iovis Trilogy:

Colors in the Mechanism of Concealment featuring her own reading with her
son, Ambrose Bye,

playing music. Other readers include *Mei-mei Berssenbrugge*,* Ana Bo=BEi=
=E8evi=E6
*, *Amy King*,* Julie*

*Patton*, and *Stacy Szymaszek*.



The Iovis Trilogy, Waldman's monumental feminist epic, traverses epochs,
cultures, and genres

to create a visionary call to poetic arms. Iovis details the misdeeds of
the Patriarch, and with a

fierce imagination queries and subverts his warmongering. All of Waldman's
themes come into

focus--friendship, motherhood, politics, and Buddhist wisdom. This is epic
poetry that goes

beyond the old injunction "to include history"--its effort is to change
history.



The Iovis Trilogy is the winner of Pen Center USA's Poetry Award for 2012.



This event is made possible through the Poets House Literary Partners Space
Rental Program.



*Location: Poets House, 10 River Terrace, New York, NY 10282*


*Admission: $10 suggested donation. Nobody turned away.
*



Reader bios:



*Mei-mei Berssenbrugge* is the author of twelve books of poetry, most
recently a collaboration about

weather, The Lit Cloud, with artist Kiki Smith published by Galerie Lelong.
A collection of poems, Hello,

the Roses is forthcoming from New Directions Press. She lives in New York
City and northern New

Mexico.



*Ana Bo=BEi=E8evi=E6* is the author of Stars of the Night Commute and Rise =
in the
Fall. Her translation of Zvonko

Karanovi=E6 recently received a PEN American Center/NYSCA grant. She flirts
with knowledge at The

Graduate Center, CUNY in New York City.



Of* Amy King*'s most recent book from Litmus Press, I Want to Make You
Safe, John Ashbery described

her poems as bringing "abstractions to brilliant, jagged life, emerging
into rather than out of the

busyness of living." King conducts interviews for VIDA: Woman in Literary
Arts and teaches English and

Creative Writing at SUNY Nassau Community College. Visit her online @
http://amyking.org for more.



Poet/Performance artist *Julie Ezelle Patton*'s recent work appears in I'll
Drown My Book, About Place

Journal: Rust Belt Tales, ((eco(lang)uage(reader)), Critiphoria. Julie's
pioneering work with Let it Bee

Greenway, a land conservation project based in Cleveland, Ohio, has been
honored with a 2012 Doan

Brook Association Watershed Hero Award. She lives in New York City. She
digs gigs with Brad Jones,

Daniel Carter and anyone else willing to "throw down" with a badass
improvising wordist.



*Stacy Szymaszek* is the author of Emptied of All Ships and Hyperglossia
(both Litmus Press), among

other titles. Her chapbook austerity measures is due out this year and she
is working on a manuscript

St. Mark's Church.



*Ambrose Bye*--musician (piano/keyboard, guitar, voice), composer,
producer--grew up in the

environment of The Jack Kerouac School of Disembodied Poetics at Naropa
University, counting Allen

Ginsberg and William Burroughs as "poetic" godfathers. He graduated from
The University of California

Santa Cruz with a degree in music/sociology and was certified at the music
/production program at the

Pyramind Institute in San Francisco, working on numerous productions and
his own compositions as

well. He has produced four albums with Anne Waldman: In the Room of Never
Grieve, The Eye of the

Falcon, Matching Half, and The Milk of Universal Kindness.



*Anne Waldman* has published over forty books of poetry, including The
Iovis Trilogy: Colors in the

Mechanism of Concealment (Coffee House Press, 2011), Manatee/Humanity

a manuscript that has recently been published by Shearsman Books.

poet-scholars Alan Ram=F3n Clinton and Elizabeth Willis; a collaborative fi=
lm
narration by Flushing-based poet and filmmaker Stephanie Gray* *and Queens
poet laureate Paolo Javier; a joint performance by poet and professor Lee
Ann Brown and poet-artist Julie Patton; and recent work by experimental
filmmaker Mark Street. Sixteen-millimeter presentations of key films by
Cornell, including *Rose Hobart* (1936, 17 mins.), *A Legend for
Fountains* (1957=961965,

Friends,



I write to share some publication news with you. *H=E9l=E8ne, *my a novella=
 in
verse, was published recently by Furniture Press. You can order a copy here
(soon available also on SPD):
http://furniturepressbooks.com/books/poehelene/. Of the book, Sandra Doller
writes:



In this remarkable lineated novella, Deborah Poe=92s concentrated images
accrete & transform: =93orange-edged=94 becomes =93gold,=94 silk & lives ar=
e
bartered, nuns see yet do not say. Poe=92s brilliantly rhythmic prose lines
both interrogate & untangle fixed notions of genre & narration, spinning
conversation between white spaces while experimenting with utterance & its
antecedent silences; =93I could think of no conversation to start=94 become=
s =93I
can feel your loom all the way over here/a chest silent, full of light.=94 =
In
parts old-fashioned, sepia, handwritten, in parts postmodern patchwork
lyric, the artist behind this work is generously capable of holding the
paradox of distance & disappearance in proximity, inviting us to consider
ceasing =93the mind=92s clattering=94 via an astonishingly moving feminist
lullaby to times & places past.
Sandra Doller



In addition to *H=E9l=E8ne,*, *Keep, *a chapbook with selections from my ne=
west
poetry manuscript in progress, was just published with above/ground:
http://www.abovegroundpress.blogspot.ca/2012/10/new-from-aboveground-press-=
keep-by.html.
I lastly want to share my interview with *Womens Quarterly
Conversation, * published
in September:* *
http://womensquarterlyconversation.com/2012/09/23/profiles-in-linguistics-a=
nd-poetics-deborah-poe/
.



I am in the process of scheduling readings through fall of 2013 to
celebrate these publications as well as my third poetry collection *the
last will be stone, too *(February 2013). Please get in touch with me if
you are interested in scheduling a reading, or if you would like to review =
*
H=E9l=E8ne *or *Keep. *



You can find information on upcoming readings and events, as I add them,
here: http://www.deborahpoe.com/events.html. Thank you for your time and
consideration.



Warm wishes,

_____________________________________


Do you remember the film "REDS," by Warren Beatty?  The lives, needs,
and desires of Jack Reed, Louise Bryant, Eugene O'Neill, Emma Goldman,
and many others were represented in an epic sprawling over several
continents.

But one of the most curious features of this film was the inclusion of
small groups of "witnesses" who interrupted the dramatic flow from
time to time.  They were persons who actually had known Reed, O'Neill
and/or the other people struggling in the story of the film, or were
able to describe effectively the times of the epic.

One project I am working on at the moment is a small archive
concerning the 1960s.  (My collection of Sixties materials is already
scheduled to be placed with a university archive.)  The thought
occurred to me that I could include my own "witnesses" as interrupters
of my own archive.  Thus I am attempting to recruit anyone who lived
through the 1960s, and has interesting stories to report, to submit a
writing.

My process will be participatory and inclusive.  I have no "party
line."  I welcome writings in any language and from any country.  And
I welcome any viewpoint on any or all dimensions of the 1960s,
artistic, social, liberatory, cultural or countercultural, economic,
political (or anti-political), religious (or anti-religious), musical,
etc., etc.  And I welcome Visual Poetry, in its own right.

During the 1960s, did you have interesting face-to-face encounters
with Theodor W. Adorno, Michelangelo Antonioni, Joan Baez, The
Beatles, John M. Bennett, Joseph Beuys, William S. Burroughs, John
Cage, Noam Chomsky, Christo, Bob Cobbing, Gregory Corso, Stuart
Christie, Raya Dunayevskaya, Bob Dylan, Medgar Evers, Federico
Fellini, Lawrence Ferlinghetti, Ian Hamilton Finlay, Allen Ginsberg,
V=E1clav Havel, Seamus Heaney, Dick Higgins, Allan Kaprow, Jack Kerouac,
Martin Luther King, Philip Lamantia, John Lennon, Herbert Marcuse, Nam
June Paik, Bern Porter, Herbert Read, Franklin Rosemont, The Smothers
Brothers, Twiggy, Andy Warhol, or Frank Zappa?

Or, did you have interesting encounters with "ordinary" people?

In either case, I want to know your story (or stories).

Limits?  Any writing from one small paragraph to 17 pages of text!
Drawings and artwork may be included but, with them, there must be
some kind of written text about the era.

My deadline to receive submissions is the end of November.

Your writings will NOT be published by me.  They will simply be
included in an archive university collection on the Sixties.  If you
want to restrict publication by others of your text than put the
copyright mark on it.

Do NOT date your text!  (If you put a 2012 date on your text someone
at the university archive will stick it into a 2012 file-folder!  I
want to blend these statements by "witnesses" of the era into my own
archive of the 1960s.)

Thank you.

Send your written and signed text to ...

MIME-Version: 1.0

STATEMENT

I, Jennifer Karmin, plan to do a final street performance of 4000 Words 4000 Dead on November 12, 2012 from 12-1pm.

The performance shall happen in downtown Chicago, beginning in front of the Vietnam War Memorial at Wabash & Wacker and ending in front of the U.S. Army Career Center at Harrison & State.

In April 2008, I began collecting 4000 words as a memorial to the 4000 dead American soldier who had been killed in Iraq.  Submissions came from friends, students, writers, activists, soldiers, and those who read about the project online.  I asked each person to send me 1-10 words, gave parts of the poem away to pedestrians during public performances across the country, and painted the words using the American flag as a writing utensil in two installations.

4000 Words 4000 Dead is a companion piece to Revolutionary Optimism, a response to Abu Ghraib based on confessions from Iraqi prisoners, sympathy cards, and The Tibetan Book of the Dead.  Both texts have just been published as a chapbook by Sona Books and will be released online for Memorial Day weekend 2013.

Dear friends,

In the latest AngelHousePress essay, "Stochastic Acts: the search string
as poetry," Mark Young examines the collage of realities and talks about
poem making strategies involving the Google search string.

Please visit www.angelhousepress.com and click on essays.

remember, if  you haven't already sent me an essay, rant, manifesto,
interview, review etc for the essay series, please do so. it can be on
any topic related to art & culture, on your own artistic practice or
someone else's. hope to hear from you.

stay tuned for the launch of the fifth issue of Experiment-O,
AngelHousePress's annual online PDF magazine that celebrates the art of
risk. all being well, it should be out by the end of the month.

best,
Amanda Earl

this is to announce the existence of the ex-ex-lit
[experiential-experimental literature] blog.
many poets are represented.
with 113 members and over 2,100 posts, the blog is in the forefront of
experimentation with alphanumeric language/literature.
poetry that extends the range of experient-experimentation with language is
the tenor of this blog.
categories are always difficult but this is not a blog for vispo--------it
is concerned with the possibilities of letters, numbers, symbols-----in
other words, *text.*
it can be found at http://ex-ex-lit.blogspot.com
submissions are welcome, please read some of the blog before sending
however.
send to peter ganick at <pganickz@gmail.com>

In edit mode press is now taking pre-orders for LOCAL COLOUR : Ghosts,
variations:

LOCAL COLOUR : Ghosts, variations  is a collaboration between In Edit Mode
Press and Canadian poet Derek Beaulieu. The publication takes as its point
of departure, Paul Auster=B9s novella Ghosts, and, in particular, Derek
Beaulieu=B9s reworking of Auster=B9s text, Local Colour, which he describes as
follows:
=8CLocal Colour=B9 is a page-by-page interpretation of Paul Auster=B9s 72-page
novella =8CGhosts=B9. =8CGhosts=B9 concerns itself with Blue, a private detective
hired by a mysterious character named White to transcribe the actions of
Black, a denizen of Brooklyn Heights living on Orange Street. As Blue
reports his findings, the reader becomes more aware of the intricate
relationship between Black and White, and a tactile awareness of the role o=
f
colour spreads through the narrative. With =8CLocal Colour=B9, I have removed
the entirety of Auster=B9s text, leaving only chromatic words=8Bproper nouns or
not=8Bspread across the page as dollops of paint on a palette. Taking
inspiration from Kenneth Goldsmith=B9s Gertrude Stein on Punctuation (Abaton
Books, 2000) what remains is the written equivalent of ambient music=8Bwords
which are meant to be seen but not read. The colours, through repetition,
build a suspense and crescendo which is loosened from traditional narrative
into a more pointillist construction.

Focusing on the tension created in Beaulieu=B9s manuscript =AD and alluded to i=
n
the description of his process =AD between the textual narrative and the
relatively abstract graphical mark, and the opening it seems to provide
towards a sonic realm, we are now hoping to solicit a series of textual,
aural, oral, musical, and other interpretations, as well as more machinic
=8Cutilisations=B9, of Beaulieu=B9s manuscript. What interests us, in particular,
is the way in which Local Colour seems to split Auster=B9s narrative text
open, deterritorialising it, serially, by rendering it purely graphical,
freeing it up, in the same gesture, to an excess and a bifurcation of
meaning. Seeking to extend and amplify this ambition, we are now opening th=
e
project up for others =AD writers, poets, musicians, artists =AD to split
Beualieu=B9s manuscript open, to deterritorialise the coloured rectangles of
his manuscript by textual, aural, narrative, graphical and other means.

Local Colour: Ghosts, variations collects and counterposes a wide array of
strategies and approaches. It features both textual and aural contributions
and contributions that combine text and sound. We hope it will prove an
ambitious, vigorous collection that oscillates and moves between textual
narrative, graphical mark, and aural impression, exploring these different
realms whilst rendering uncertain any easy distinction between them.

great work they do in highlighting the most compelling and imaginative
literary works of our time -- I'm writing to ask you to show your
support for this national literary treasure based in Minnesota. I know
there are so many urgent causes in need of attention, but even a mere
$10 will help put Rain Taxi in the running for additional funds. Give
what you can! *

I'm doing something media quirky for my book DICK, transmitting it via 365
transmissions over the coming year via FB and Twitter.  It's "about" the
JFK assassination - or, as it is written, "Made of maps, mirrors and
labyrinths - though grounded in proprietary knowledge - DICK is a book that
explodes the Kennedy assassination and the machinations around that event.
References to the JFK murder are in fact quite oblique: in fact, the whole
work is, including most obdurately the integral deployment of Morse Code as
text..."

Thanks for mulling, being there, and

Alan Sondheim pens Writing Under: Selection from "The Internet Text"

MORGANTOWN, W.Va. -- The Center for Literary Computing and West Virginia
University Press are pleased to announce the publication of _Writing
Under: Selections From the Internet Text_ by Alan Sondheim. This
extraordinary collection of work explores and examines what happens to
writing as it takes place on and through the networked computer.

Sondheim began experimenting with artistic and philosophical writing using
computers in the early 1970s. Since 1994, he has explored the
possibilities of writing on the Internet, whether using blogs, web pages,
e-mails, virtual worlds, or other tools. The sum total of Sondheim.s
writing online is entitled "The Internet Text."

_Writing Under_ selects from this work to provide insight into how writing
takes place today and into the unique practices of a writer. The
selections range from philosophical musings, to technical explorations of
writing practice, to poetic meditations on the writer online. This work
expands our understanding of writing today and charts a path for writing.s
future.

John Cayley of Brown University proclaims Alan Sondheim to be "the poet,
the artist, the maker who has most profoundly immersed himself and his
work in the life-changing code formsof networked computation that have
the world and its 'genesis redux' in their grip." Christopher T.
Funkhouser of New Jersey Institute of Technology affirms that "anyone
interested in knowing more about (or from) a writer who has practiced and
thrived on the Internet since its very beginnings needs to read this
book." (See below for more.)

Alan Sondheim is a Brooklyn-based new media artist, musician, writer, and
performer. He is concerned with issues of virtuality, and the stake that
the real world has in the virtual.

_Writing Under_ is published by the Center for Literary Computing, West
Virginia University. To order this title or to learn more about this book

Writing Under: Selections From the Internet Text by Alan Sondheim
December 2012/216pp

PB 978-1-935978-73-2/$19.99

"Alan Sondheim is one of the precious few who joyfully-and in abject
misery-risks these terrors of writing for us, for our pleasure and our
undoing. What happens? Language disposes of us. As if that were not all
that is required of any writer, Alan Sondheim is also the poet, the
artist, the maker who has most profoundly immersed himself and his work in
the life-changing code-forms of networked computation that have the world
and its 'genesis redux' in their grip."

- John Cayley, Literary Arts, Brown University

"Sondheim crafts an often meandering + always introspective recording of
his prodigious on-line output. Birthed [and often remixed] in digital
formats and drenched in anxiousness + desire, his staggeringly open text
gives rise to possibilities of endless interpretation and comprehension,
leaving multiple re-reads a definite must."

- Mez Breeze, Australian-based writer and practitioner of net.art

"Encountering Alan Sondheim's work we become aware how versatile a writer
he is. The vast fore-lands of his Internet Text contains an estimated
25,000 pages of wryting involving - as Sandy Baldwin observes in his
introduction "a phenomenology thick with human perception and intentions
that are bodily, personal, political, and communal." In wryting, Sondheim
produces all sorts of texts - poetry, prose, and the unnameable
compositions existing amidst conditions of material transformations that
merge (with) the physical and technological. Writing Under offers up
generous statements of process, from a self- and other- aware master who
is codework's godcyborg, a limner of psychedelic landscapes in Second
Life, and an inveterate graphophile. This volume radiates foresight,
stabilizing, if only for a moment, the fragility of "tenuously tethered
bits and bytes" that exist in a vast field. For Sondheim, the creative is
critical and vice versa; there's much telling in _Writing Under,_
projecting insight into the machinery of his oeuvre. Anyone interested in
knowing more about (or from) a writer who has practiced and thrived on the
Internet since its very beginnings needs to read this book."

New Jersey Institute of Technology

Station Hill Press has published Michael Ruby=92s trilogy, MEMORIES, DREAMS
AND INNER VOICES. For review copies, contact publishers@stationhill.org


Here is a description of the 240-page book; blurbs from Jerome Rothenberg
and Bernadette Mayer; and Michael Ruby=92s bio:


In *Memories, Dreams and Inner Voices*, poet Michael Ruby records three
strands of our most elusive experiences: the involuntary memories of bygone
times and places that flash across our minds day and night; the mysterious
inner voices heard in the last seconds before sleep; and the dreams we
mostly forget upon waking.  Taken together, Ruby=92s trilogy is a unique
fusion of personal history, fiction and poetry that not only rescues
unplumbed psychic experience but also exults in the laughter, terror and
baffling innuendos of unbidden utterance.



If =93experiment=94 means anything when we speak of *experimental* poetry,
Michael Ruby=92s gathering is a moving testament to the still real
possibilities of such a venture/adventure.  His project here=97to explore
=93the varieties of unconscious experience=94 as they come to him=97is an a=
spect
of what Gary Snyder once described as =93the real work of modern man: to
uncover the inner structure and actual boundaries of the mind.=94  That
Ruby=92s workings with memory, dream, and the experience of language betwee=
n
sleep and waking issue in a new and powerful work of poesis is something to
be celebrated and experienced by all of us in turn.

--Jerome Rothenberg



Thank you, Michael Ruby, for illustrating how to write: by giving us
memories, dreams and the hypnagogic words available to us humans who can
swim in that stream.  No lifeguard on duty.  Beware!

--Bernadette Mayer

The Renaissance Society presents a reading by
*Hung Q. Tu, poet*
Sunday, November 18, 2pm
FREE - Cobb Hall (5811 S Ellis Ave), Room 409

Born in Vietnam and raised in San Diego, Tu is the author of two highly
praised volumes, *Verisimilitude* (Atelos Press) and*Structures of
Feeling *(Krupskaya
press). According to poet Rodrigo Toscano, =93Tu's poetic modules are not
=91pieces=92 in the traditional sense=97that is, thematically staged,
subjectively actored, and assumedly audienced, they are more like an
intelligent arraying of graffiti that you'd run into in a modern city's
sub-throughway, perhaps a bit run-down, but with a shiny glass building
across the street=97that is, a city intra-imperialized in every way, its
complicit fractals, its bio-bit patois scrawled all about.=94

If that eloquent description/testimonial doesn=92t move you to put this eve=
nt
on your calendar then there is no hope. This event will take place in Cobb
Hall Room 409, down the hall from the gallery.  It is FREE and open to the
public.

Please feel free to forward this along to others who may be interested.

*Belladonna* is pleased to present:*

*IOVIS Reading*
*Thursday, November 15, 2012; 7 pm*
*Poets House, 10 River Terrace, NYC
*

A group/polyvocal performance from Anne Waldman's award-winning epic The
Iovis Trilogy:
Colors in the Mechanism of Concealment featuring her own reading with her
son, Ambrose Bye,
playing music. Other readers include *Mei-mei Berssenbrugge*,* Ana Bo=BEi=
=E8evi=E6
*, *Amy King*,* Julie*
*Patton*, and *Stacy Szymaszek*.

The Iovis Trilogy, Waldman's monumental feminist epic, traverses epochs,
cultures, and genres
to create a visionary call to poetic arms. Iovis details the misdeeds of
the Patriarch, and with a
fierce imagination queries and subverts his warmongering. All of Waldman's
themes come into
focus--friendship, motherhood, politics, and Buddhist wisdom. This is epic
poetry that goes
beyond the old injunction "to include history"--its effort is to change
history.

The Iovis Trilogy is the winner of Pen Center USA's Poetry Award for 2012.

This event is made possible through the Poets House Literary Partners Space
Rental Program.

*Location: Poets House, 10 River Terrace, New York, NY 10282*

*Admission: $10 suggested donation. Nobody turned away.
*

Reader bios:

*Mei-mei Berssenbrugge* is the author of twelve books of poetry, most
recently a collaboration about
weather, The Lit Cloud, with artist Kiki Smith published by Galerie Lelong.

the Roses is forthcoming from New Directions Press. She lives in New York
City and northern New
Mexico.

*Ana Bo=BEi=E8evi=E6* is the author of Stars of the Night Commute and Rise =
in the
Fall. Her translation of Zvonko
Karanovi=E6 recently received a PEN American Center/NYSCA grant. She flirts
with knowledge at The
Graduate Center, CUNY in New York City.

Of* Amy King*'s most recent book from Litmus Press, I Want to Make You
Safe, John Ashbery described
her poems as bringing "abstractions to brilliant, jagged life, emerging
into rather than out of the
busyness of living." King conducts interviews for VIDA: Woman in Literary
Arts and teaches English and
Creative Writing at SUNY Nassau Community College. Visit her online @
http://amyking.org for more.

Poet/Performance artist *Julie Ezelle Patton*'s recent work appears in I'll

digs gigs with Brad Jones,
Daniel Carter and anyone else willing to "throw down" with a badass
improvising wordist.

(both Litmus Press), among
other titles. Her chapbook austerity measures is due out this year and she

Pyramind Institute in San Francisco, working on numerous productions and
his own compositions as
well. He has produced four albums with Anne Waldman: In the Room of Never
Grieve, The Eye of the
Falcon, Matching Half, and The Milk of Universal Kindness.

*Anne Waldman* has published over forty books of poetry, including The
Iovis Trilogy: Colors in the
Mechanism of Concealment (Coffee House Press, 2011), Manatee/Humanity
(Penguin, 2009), In

Press, 2003), and

the Naropa Institute in Boulder, Colorado. She was elected an Chancellor of
the Academy of American
Poets in 2011. Currently Waldman is the director of the MFA Writing and

In this tale, conceived as a biographical hypothesis, the author and his
grandfather meet posthumously. The resultant exploration of an existence
played quietly out across the 20th century, through provincial French
childhood, war, colonization and provincial French retirement, comes to us
as a composite=97some remembered, some researched, some wholly imagined=97o=
f
careful, longing glances.

"On this lexical roadtrip, we delight in the drama of the anagram=92s deep
weathers: there=92s an 'errant impasse' in the 'itinerant passenger,' there=
=92s
'amber' in our 'chambers.' Content is the secret that our forms yield up to
us. With gorgeous clarity, *Videotape *recalibrates our sightlines through
the limber lens of our words." =97Jena Osman

"A contemporary poetic landscape forms in the mind's eye no
anthologizing entelechy blesses....Make less anthology, more poetry".
                                         Corey Wakeling  (an
Australian poet represented in this feature.)

The fifty-one poets included in this feature comprise a modest
cross-section of contemporary Australian poetry.
I think this collection of poems is "less anthology, more poetry".

I am pleased to present, with Michael Hennessey, editor of Jacket2,
the fifth and final instalment of the feature of poems and visual art
:
http://jacket2.org/feature/fifty-one-contemporary-poets-australia-part-5


I hope you enjoy it.

Very best wishes,
Pam Brown

> A three-week institute for twenty-five college and university faculty on A=
frican-American poetry and poetics.
> Project director Maryemma Graham, a professor of English at the University=
 of Kansas (KU), investigates African-American poetry from the early twentie=
th century to the present in this summer program. The approach moves "from s=
ocial context and ideology to the texts and poetics," allowing the project "=
to generate new ways and new critical tools for reading, teaching, and inter=
preting a range of black poetries." Lorenzo Thomas's Don't Deny My Name: Wor=
ds and Music and the Black Intellectual Tradition is read in its entirety be=
fore the institute begins. The program is divided into three week-long segme=
nts. The first week, on traditions in Black poetry, 1900-1960, including mod=
ernism and the Harlem Renaissance, is led by Jerry Ward (English, Dillard Un=
iversity) and Joanne Gabbin (English, James Madison University). The second w=
eek, on the aesthetics and production of Black poetry during the Black Arts e=
ra from 1960 to 1980, is conducted by Howard Ramsby II (Black studies, South=
ern Illinois University-Edwardsville). The third week, on African-American p=
oetry, 1980-present, is led by Tony Bolden (African American Studies, KU). A=
 central theme of the institute, the relationship between oral and written p=
oetry, is particularly prominent during the third week, as the group investi=
gates contemporary works. Numerous poets are to be studied, including Paul L=
aurence Dunbar, James Weldon Johnson, Jean Toomer, Langston Hughes, Robert H=
ayden, Gwendolyn Brooks, Amiri Baraka, Nikki Giovanni, Rita Dove, Natasha Tr=
etheway, Terrance Hayes, and Nikky Finney. The institute meets five days a w=
eek for lectures, discussions, group collaborative work on research and curr=
icular projects, panel presentations, and multimedia/digital presentations o=
f poetry. In addition to the weekly session leaders, there are shorter prese=
ntations by twelve visiting literature faculty members, including Aldon Niel=
sen (Penn State University), J. Edgar Tidwell (English, KU), R. Baxter Mille=
r (University of Georgia), Opal Moore (Spelman College), Adam Bradley (Unive=
rsity of Colorado), and Meta DuEwa Jones (University of Texas, Austin). In a=
ddition to reading poetry throughout the institute, participants study selec=
ted criticism, much of it by institute faculty. In the fall following the in=
stitute, there are follow-up online sessions with prominent African-American=
 poets, including Giovanni, Hayes, and Dove.

I don't remember if they called it an institute back then, but I was in a=
n
NEH Summer Seminar, the first or second year of the program.  (There was =
a
moment in my life I LIKED William Bennett.)  It was a 6-week seminar on
Friendship as a Theme in Literature, at Kenyon College, run by the profes=
sor
who was one of a two-editor team to revive the Kenyon Review. It was a gr=
eat
experience, great.  Also one of my fellow teachers discovered a firefly
grotto in Gambier, and since I was coming from L.A., hadn't seen fireflie=
s
since I was eight, it was qua-doubly terrific.  The program has expanded
since 1984--which is all for the good in terms of canon rethinking.  If y=
ou
know an educator, push her or him to try for this.  Five classes A DAY of=

teaching English--man oh man high school teachers deserve a treat.

p.s.
Yes, I see that Aldon's message is for college profs.  Even better for TH=
IS
listserv. The program for high school teachers I was extolling can be fou=
nd
at the link below, fireflies and all, and my recommendation holds steadfa=
st,
or I do, despite flux and mutability. (I have taught in colleges and
universities--racked up almost ten years here and there, by the way, but
only as adjunct.)

For those in the SF Bay Area there is - I believe it is still up "1968" at =
the Oakland Museum - a good mix of television footage, ephemera, etc. Excel=
lent on the Black Panthers, MLK, Vietnam, Chicago Dem Convention, Bobby Ken=
nedy, etc. Made me 'homesick' for the voice of Walter Cronkite! =A0I don't =
know if the show is traveling. It should.=A0
One could say in 1968 this country had a profound nervous breakdown (as did=
 France & no doubt other places). Nothing substantial went - at least for a=
 short time - 'unpillared' & unexposed. A vision, as well, magnified by sub=
stantial intakes of grass & acid. & yes, Alan Ginsberg, wandering through i=
t all & trying to 'manage' a vibrant calm at the center. =A0Yes, i'68 was s=
till an era led by men, an iconography that was just beginning to crumble a=
nd struggle towards new definitions.=A0
& boy, how for the last 40 years has the right wing been on a vicious rampa=
ge to put =A0the genies back in 'the bottle.' =A0As Romney - the 50's poste=
r boy for 'good' - was/is clearly vicious & vengefully 'cold war' =A0nostal=

There are a bunch of books, unlike Reed's considered classics once upon a t=

Dear Friends and Colleagues:

As this project continues to reveal itself, the introduction continues
to be revised:
http://www.cddc.vt.edu/host/weishaus/Home/Intro.htm

Now each "letter" can be opened from the introduction page, or in sequence.
Some of the first  texts have been slightly rewritten, and typos
(hopefully) corrected.

As always, comments and critique are welcome.

Warm Regards,
Joel

Well yes, Thanks Shira,

It's good that some of 'Lana Turner' is online because the magazine
doesn't offer subscriptions to anyone living outside the USA.

MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=windows-1252
Content-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable

*kadar koli** no. 8: =93dystranslation=94*



After the enthusiastic response to last year=92s =93violence=94 issue of *k=
adar
koli*=97featuring contributions from *Joyelle McSweeney*, *Richard Owens*, =
*Rob
Halpern*, *Julie Carr*, *jos=E9 felipe alvergue*, *Maggie Nelson*, *Diane d=
i
Prima*, *Emily Critchley*, *Justin Katko*, *Shin Yu Pai*, *Gloria
Frym*, *Daniel
C. Remein*, *Dale Smith*, *Jared Schickling*, and *Laura Kilbride*=97the
theme of this issue of *kadar koli* is =93dystranslation.=94 This is our te=
rm
for translation that presents some kind of difficulty or aporia that forces
the translator (or editor, etc.) to make choices=97gaps, smudges, mistakes
that require interpretation. These translations might demand *emendatio*,
the correction of an unlikely word or phrase in a text, or even *divinatio*=
,
an extreme form of *emendatio*, where the editor relies on special insight
into what the author really intended, even if the text is more or less
legible as presented.



For example, editors and translators over the years have troubled the
reading of =93pluma=94 in Horace=92s *Carmen* 4.10, rendering wildly diverg=
ent
interpretations of the line. The opening of the poem reads:



O crudelis adhuc et Veneris muneribus potens,

inseperata tuae cum veniet pluma superbiae,



Oh you=97cruel and, for now, quite well endowed, flush with the gifts of Lo=
ve=97

once that =91pluma=92 that you=97you in your pride=97didn=92t foresee arriv=
es,



As Chris Piuma notes, to read it as =93pluma=94 offers the following sense:
=93once that fledgling mustache you in your pride didn=92t foresee arrives=
=85 =94
But the following alternatives have been suggested as well:



*bruma*: once those wintery hairs you in your pride didn=92t foresee arrive=
s

*ruga*: once those wrinkles that you=97you in your pride=97didn=92t foresee=
 arrive

*poena*: once the suffering that you=97you in your pride=97didn=92t foresee
arrives

*plaga*: once the welting that you=97you in your pride=97didn=92t foresee a=
rrives

*multa*: once the manifold things you in your pride didn=92t foresee arrive

*palma*: once the victory prize you in your pride didn=92t foresee arrives



This issue of *kadar koli* invites contributors to think through moments of
dystranslation, either those they=92ve encountered in reading and research,
such as that noted above, or in their own translation work. We are
interested in examples from poetry and prose, from whatever time period,
language, or location. We will publish a selection of translation examples
(with original language specimens, if possible), essays on translation
practice, and translations of essays related to this topic. Potential
contributors should feel free to interpret dystranslation broadly; any
translation or engagement with translation that deviates from normative
expectations will be considered (where =93normative=94 is understood as lin=
ear,
literal, unproblematic, etc.). Dystranslation, by contrast, is creative,
experimental, controversial. Instead of eliding difficulties, it highlights
and engages with them, blurring (intentionally or not) the lines between
poet/writer and translator/editor. We are especially interested in work
that pushes at such boundaries, and=97while we are not interested in =93fak=
e=94
translation per se, we are intrigued by the question of what constitutes
=93real=94 v. =93fake=94 translation=97is a translation inherently less wor=
thwhile if

Subject:      Poetics.ca 1-8 (2002-2007),
              the poetics journal edited by Stephen Brockwell and rob mclennan
              is back online,

Edited by rob mclennan and Stephen Brockwell, Poetics.ca disappeared from
the internet for a short time, but now has a permanent home off the
ottawater site. A precursor to seventeen seconds: a journal of poetry and
poetics, Poetics.ca worked to engage a dialogue between different styles,
geographies and tastes.

For those in Brooklyn (and whoever treks from elsewhere): As part of the Parachute Festival, this coming Saturday, Dec 1, I'm reading with Sheila Maldonado, Amanda Deutch, and the Believe Project's performance of Muriel Rukeyser's words on Coney Island from her 1973 play, Houdini (Paris Press) in the Brooklyn Museum. The performance begins at 9 (be on time) and lasts an hour.

Greetings, friends and supporters,



I am very happy to announce that the Furniture Press Books 10th anniversary
reading tour/road trip has been scheduled for September 27 through October
13, 2013, and we will be visiting and reading in 13 cities in 17 days,
starting with a kick-off party in Baltimore and ending with a final
celebration in Denver. While we finalize venues and map our route, we would
like to thank you for supporting the press over the years and contributing
to the success of our mission and our writers. This is a difficult
operation, but worthwhile because you=92ve helped shape its direction and
importance.



Our undertaking over the next year is to raise $5,000 to cover all travel
expenditures for our writers, and to benefit our audiences and contributors
with giveaways and prizes. As our thanks for your generosity, we will be
making available a few discounted bundles that include all our full-length,
chap/book and limited edition titles.  Below are the deals for 2013, which

 of an unlikely word or phrase in a text, or even *divinatio*=3D=0A>,=0A>an=
 extreme form of *emendatio*, where the editor relies on special insight=0A=

legible as presented.=0A>=0A>=0A>=0A>For example, editors and translators o=
ver the years have troubled the=0A>reading of =3D93pluma=3D94 in Horace=3D9=

rom normative=0A>expectations will be considered (where =3D93normative=3D94=
 is understood as lin=3D=0A>ear,=0A>literal, unproblematic, etc.). Dystrans=

Thanks to all the contributors this year & to curators & participants in

been an enriching experience.

here's to celebrating risk & swimming against the mainstream.

anyone who hasn't yet been published in Experiment-O is welcome to send
me creative work that can be published in pdf form at any time for
consideration for next year's issue, which comes out in November, 2013.

i'm also still looking for essays, rants, interviews, manifestos, poetic
& artistic statements for the AngelHousePress essay series.

angelically yours,

M=E1rton Kopp=E1ny's art could be said to be the art of the invisible.  His
decision to abandon Hungarian in favour of English was a political one, but
something else can be said to have happened in this transition. His poetry
shifts into a language space that is alien, a snow-blinding landscape that
is finding itself, built piece by piece through a poetry where language
objects - real and linguistic - float with intent, testing the boundaries
of language as intuition. =97*Tony Trehy*



In fact, I'm not certain that there is any across-the-board method that can
be learned, and then applied, in order to understand M=E1rton Kopp=E1ny's
poems. If and/or when understanding does come, it happens (in my own
experience) *wholly *=96 and as if in a flash =96 like direct, mind-to-mind
transmission. When first seeing M=E1rton's poems Katue came quickly to mind=
.
I do not at all mean that M=E1rton's work reminded me of his. What came to =
my
mind was his statement about plastic poetry: =93Plastic poem is the *figure
of poem* itself, in other words, it is an *'apparatus of poem'*=85=94 I tak=
e
this as bare-bones poetry, in the best sense of that term. =97*Roy Arenella=
*



Conceptual art can be bountiful, spare, even beautiful. With an economy of
presentation, M=E1rton Kopp=E1ny=92s work uniquely captures, invents, and
refashions installations on the page from unexpected sources. His works run
the gamut of humor, politics, and philosophy. Each piece offers a genuine
gift of perception. With signature purity, works such as =93Asemic Volcano=
=94,
showcase the potency of word-free realities. =93Emptiness=94 is vibrant wit=
h
lui-meme realization. =93One Moment in Three Sections=94 depicts a tiny
triumph. =93Old Question=94 and =93Addendum=94 prepare the viewer for =93St=
ill Life
No. 2,=94 a final reminder of the inherent interconnectedness among all
things. The recombinant majesty of Kopp=E1ny=92s genius raises the bar for =
what
is possible in the infinitely expanding universe of visual poetry. =97*Shei=
la
E. Murphy*
