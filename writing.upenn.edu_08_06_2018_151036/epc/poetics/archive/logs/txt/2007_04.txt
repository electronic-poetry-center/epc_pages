I don't think i've ever read an issue of Agni cover to cover and enjoyed more than two pieces in it, and usually one of them is a short story. I don't
like any of the poets that foetry slags off, I don't write the kind of poetry that wins poetry contests. I think your reaction is pretty out of line.
Agni is entitled to whatever editorial policy they want to adopt, and I think a bigger problem is the editorial policy that accepts so much mediocre
poetry in a journal with such wide distribution. You seem really angry about this, though, and I really don't understand why.

Abolish bilingual education, Gingrich urges
POSTED: 10:50 p.m. EDT, March 31, 2007

http://www.cnn.com/2007/POLITICS/03/31/gingrich.bilingual.ap/index.html

WASHINGTON (AP) -- Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich equated
bilingual education Saturday with "the language of living in a
ghetto" and mocked requirements that ballots be printed in multiple
languages.

"The government should quit mandating that various documents be
printed in any one of 700 languages depending on who randomly shows
up" to vote, said Gingrich, who is considering seeking the Republican
presidential nomination in 2008. He made the comments in a speech to
the National Federation of Republican Women.

"The American people believe English should be the official language
of the government. ... We should replace bilingual education with
immersion in English so people learn the common language of the
country and they learn the language of prosperity, not the language
of living in a ghetto," Gingrich said to cheers from the crowd of
more than 100.

"Citizenship requires passing a test on American history in English.
If that's true, then we do not have to create ballots in any language
except English," he said.

Peter Zamora, co-chair of the Washington-based Hispanic Education
Coalition, which supports bilingual education, said, "The tone of his
comments were very hateful. Spanish is spoken by many individuals who
do not live in the ghetto."

He said research has shown "that bilingual education is the best
method of teaching English to non-English speakers."
Spanish-speakers, Zamora said, know they need to learn English.

"There's no resistance to learning English, really, among immigrants,
among native-born citizens," he said. "Everyone wants to learn
English because it's what you need to thrive in this country."

In the past, Gingrich has supported making English the nation's
official language. He's also said all American children should learn
English and that other languages should be secondary in schools.

In 1995, for example, he said bilingualism poses "long-term dangers
to the fabric of our nation" and that "allowing bilingualism to
continue to grow is very dangerous."

Bilingual programs teach students reading, arithmetic and other basic
skills in their native language so they do not fall behind while
mastering English.

On voting, federal law requires districts with large populations of
non-English speakers to print ballots in multiple languages.

The issue is bigger than your taste in poems, AGNI's taste in poems, the
type of poetry you write, poetry contests or Foetry. The issue is that a
respected journal has been cowed into apologizing for making their editorial
decision based on the poem at hand.  AGNI seems to be saying that they made
a mistake, that if they had known about someone's activities outside the
realm of the poem, they would not have published it. Sure, AGNI can do
whatever they want vis a vis publishing this or that poem. But to publically
state that someone's actions outside a poem mandate a different response to
that poem and even a deliberate block of publication of that poem, is, to
me, sheer McCarthy-ism.  It's about the poem, not the poet. Any other
"editorial policy" is reprehensible. That's why I'm "so angry."  And that's
why any poet here should be as angry as I am that AGNI, a respected journal,
has now revealed such an editorial policy.  Do you dare submit work to AGNI?
Are you sure you're MORAL enough for them?  Ugh.

Poems*.  He has also published a novel, *Moira Orfei in Aigues-Mortes*, and five books of
nonfiction:  *Andy Warhol*, *Cleavage*, *Jackie Under My Skin*, *The Queen’s Throat* (a National
Book Critics Circle Award finalist), and *Double Talk*.  He wrote the libretto for Michael
Daugherty’s opera, *Jackie O*.  Koestenbaum’s next book, *Hotel Theory*, will be published in May
2007.  He is a Distinguished Professor of English at the CUNY Graduate Center, and currently also
a Visiting Professor in the painting department of the Yale School of Art.

But I made it far enough through the first act to be struck, when Anna Moffo entered, with a
sensation I’ve tried to describe before, and may never adequately name. Her timbre was separate
from its surroundings. Her voice wasn’t the canopy, the column, the architrave; gravely
self-sufficient, it seemed not a copy of life, but life itself, and, like a breathing property, it
entered my system with a vector so naïve, unadulterated, and elemental, that my drab bedroom
shifted on its axis.
~ from Wayne Koestenbaum’s *The Queen’s Throat*

Douglas A. Martin's most recent books are *Branwell*, a novel of the Bronte brother, and a
collection of stories, *They Change the Subject*. His first novel, *Outline of My Lover*, was
named an International Book of the Year in the Times Literary Supplement and adapted in part by
the Forsythe Company for their multimedia dance-theater piece "Kammer/Kammer."  He is also the
author of two collections of poetry and a co-author of *the haiku year*.  In 2008,  he will
publish *Last Early Poems* and a work of lyric prose, *Your Body Figured*.

To not believe there’s goodness where he sees what he does. How could I be wary of someone he
trusts? He likes, has allowed to be his friend. Someone who will be connected. Again and again, in
this magazine and picture, this paper and book.

Someone he will let exist in a way I never do.
~ from Douglas A. Martin’s *Outline of My Lover*

do your poems contain multitudes or live as variously as possible? then
submit to Spaltung.  we are looking for writing that explores
multiplicity/heterogeneity on a formal/material/compositional level,
including (without limitation) polyphonic/multivoice works,
collaborations (human+human, human+computer, human+other animate or
inanimate entity, and all of the above), text+image, text+object,
text+sound, palimpsests, multiversion/multirevision works,
diagrammatical works, rebuses, multilanguage pieces, collages, mashups,
multiprocedural and conceptual works, poems masquerading as something
else, und so weiter. Spaltung will be published as a packet of stuff
rather than a bound journal.  if you would like an idea of Spaltung's
taste, you can purchase our first issue (although it was not focused on
the theme articulated above and was a bound journal) through the email
address below (it's only $4).

please send submissions to _spaltung@comcast.net_. please make sure all
attachments are in one of the following formats: .doc, .xls, .pdf, .jpg,

or in the case of sound files .mp3. if you want to send in another
format, please let us know and we will try to accommodate. if you prefer

to send snail mail, please send to

Bo and Luke Duke Sanders
1511 McLendon Ave.
Atlanta, GA 30307

please keep submissions to a reasonable length, and no more than 5
pieces per submission. please include your email address in any
submission so that we can contact you (if you don't have an email
address, please include a phone #, we're trying to save postage and
time). if you wanna include an explanation of your work with your
submission, great. simultaneous submissions are fine, just let us know
if something you sent gets accepted somewhere else. if you send by
snail, don't send us your only copy: we do not return work.

Spaltung is edited collectively by the Atlanta Poets Group. because we
do things by committee we may take a while to get back to you on your
submission. authors appearing in Spaltung will receive copies, but we
can't afford to pay you anything else.

thanks for providing a more nuanced view of certain strains of
alternative spirituality, CA -- I'm rather jaded, having come from a
legitimate study of ancient religions and seen the kind of twaddle mass
marketers of easy-bake spirituality sell in our time.=20

I think you're right about Blavatsky -- I have a copy of The Secret
Doctrine, but I haven't done more than skim it -- my Sanskrit fu is
weak, I'm afraid, and this has put me off reading her work more deeply.=20

to open this topic up to poetics, are there writers out there using New
Age or alternative spiritual traditions in their work? I've been looking
at the occult aspects of Spicer's and Duncan's poetry, but I wonder if
there are other streams to investigate, more current ones. what about I
Ching, a la Cage? I guess machine-generated, -altered, work is in a
sense aleatory in similar ways to what the earlier crew were digging
into.=20

Subject: Re: complicit actions dismissed in a frenzy of greed

 It's no mistake the author of THE SECRET is
now doing seminars with Donald Trump.  Trump,
the bastard real estate tycoon who evicted more
artists than anyone in US history! FUCK THE
SECRET!  The only secrets worth uncovering in
this world are those that destroy us everyday.

There's much to be said for spiritualists who have
been interested in helping others, especially
healing others, like Cayce.  I've been to the
Edgar Cayce Institute many times, and the
library is open, and free, all the time.  In that
library are ALL of the giant binders filled with
endless amounts of information surrounding
Cayce's long and extraordinary history of
helping people overcome disease.  And he
did all this through trance.

Blavatsky headquarters was here in my
hometown of Philadelphia.  I've been to the
Lodge of Theosophy she helped start, located
in Rittenhouse Square.  That library is also open
to the public, and free, and has everything from
Krishnamurti to Simone Weil.

What I appreciate about the Theosophists is
that they do NOT encourage dogma of one type
or another taking hold, and prefer all theology
be looked at as forms of philosophy.  And they
challenge YOU to challenge them, them being
the elders.  And let me tell you, the elders at
the Philadelphia Lodge of Theosophy are endless
fonts of wisdom and very thick-skinned to anyone
walking in. You can't knock them off track because
they're never really ON track.

And as far as Blavatsky, let me first say I'm no
Blavatsky-ite, HOWEVER, she had guts and
courage that's rare for any generation!  Imagine being
a woman in conservative Philadelphia in 1875 who
sets up shop off the University of Pennsylvania campus
and starts mouthing off to every priest she comes in
contact with!  She's brilliant in her book THE KEY TO
THEOSOPHY, which is basically a book of transcriptions
of arguments with priests.  In particular I Love her one
argument she titles, "Prayer Kills Self Reliance."  While
books like THE SECRET would have us dream our homes
into wealth, Blavatsky would have us be as vulnerable and
alone as possible to rely on ourselves FIRST, then to
move forward to help bring this world into better awareness,
kindness, and health.  For instance in her argument the
priest demands she understand how The People need
prayer to be connected to God, etc.  She takes him off
guard by arguing, Yeah, well suppose God owned a shop,
and all the workers prayed to God to do all the
work in the shop for them.  Would that be fair?  No, and
we're not here for God to do our work for us.  We're here
to figure things out, not be spoon-fed. (my paraphrase)

THE SECRET, in like, promotes weakness.  And comes
at a time when many thousands of lives are lost and
countless more shattered by our Bush regime's atrocities
we all help finance every single time we pay our taxes.

Actually, rather than DARING to submit work to Agni, i'd never BOTHER to submit work to Agni. the fact that they would publish a poem as boring as the
stuff Jeffrey Levine writes is far more damning of their editorial policy than whether or not they take into account the poets' extracurricular
activities. You say several times that Agni is a respected journal. Respected by whom? I don't give a rat's ass about Agni, so i should be upset by
their editorial policy just because they sell a lot of copies? Poetry sells a lot of copies too, does that make them respected as well? Even though
Christian Wiman wouldn't know a good poem if Walt Whitman rose from the grave and hand delivered it to him pressed in gold leaf and stating
unequivocally that "this is a good poem?" Not that he wouldn't take uncle Walt's word for it, I'm sure he would, but i doubt he'd know it was a good poem.

I'm being a bit facetious, but i really do think that you're undervaluing the importance of aesthetic concerns in poetry. I think Agni's aesthetic is
far more oppressive than any correlary like the post you quoted from Foetry. Incidentally, could you line me to the Levine controversy so I can
understand what he's accused of? I think the whole idea of poetry contests is a little degrading and stupid, to be honest with you, and as such have
never really cared for foetry's distinction between "good" contests and "bad" contests. All contests are bad for the art form I think, and the people
who participate in them ought to be shunned. As such, I think I'm maybe more in agreement with this aspect of Agni's editorial policy than I am with
their general idea of what constitutes a "good" poem.

On Friday night I witnessed one of the more remarkable evenings of poetry I have seen in many months. The event was an performance of SOUND/VISUAL/DIGITAL/POETRIES with
Crag Hill, Geof Huth, Jim Andrews & Nico Vassilakis.

The venue was Seattle's historic Good Shepherd Center, which for sixty years served women with shelter, training and education opportunities until 1973. Located in the Wallingford Neighborhood, home to Seattle's wonderful all poetry bookstore Open Books, it would have been turned into a shopping mall if not for the intervention of residents over thirty years ago. The Subtext reading is slated to move to this venue in summer.

I did not expect to write a review of the evening, so did not take notes and do not want this post to be confused with anything of that sort, but each performer had a compelling contribution to the evening's festivities. Jim Andrews, of Victoria, BC and vispo.com fame demonstrated his vis/soundpo program Nio, linked here: http://www.vispo.com/nio/ The simple tune, which can be manipulated by the person browsing his site, has a catchy little melody which lingers in one's mind, as well as interesting graphics. What a great teaching tool this program would make for beginning computer users!

Geof Huth gave a power point tour of work done by important North American visual poetry artists, such as Peter Ciccariello, Nico and Lionel Kearns, who just happened to be in the audience, visiting from Vancouver, BC. Crag performed and directed a multi-voice sound poem using a stomp of his foot to cue the readers to the next stanza.

Nico had one of his concrete films play and was quite mesmerizing. The silence during the film, at certain points when there was no soundtrack, was quite remarkable. Being in the chapel of the old building with HUGE ceilings, this experience of silence was all too rare these days, and welcome.

Later, at the restaurant afterwards I was introduced to Lionel and given a copy of his new collection
of selected poems on Talonbooks, "A Few Words Will Do." There is some incredibly remarkable poetry in that collection and I am grateful to have had such an introduction to the man and his important work. It was good to reconnect with David Abel, Michael Dylan Welch, Joe Keppler, mARK oWEns and the featured poets.

Now, as a person who has studied Open Form, the notion of process being open is rather important to me. My question to those on this list is about content. Certainly the kinds of poems performed Friday night are the most open in terms of content. It is almost totally up to the (listener) viewer as to what connections are made, what meaning is drawn. What do poets on this list feel is the poet's responsibility regarding content, if any?

I hope for an enlightening discussion, but I'll take what I can get from this list.

The situation with foetry affects all of us. It is apparent from my interactions with foetry that Alan Cordle is against all contests, even an honest one. Foetry first went after me insinuating that I appeared in the Denver Quarterly because I had Bin Ramke as a judge. That statement sat on their site for many months even after the timeline was shown to them that proved that the accusation was false. I am not sure why we were brought onto their site except for an apparent need of Cordle to attack Ramke and anyone who used him as a judge.

  The passage below written by Cordle is yet another instance of his making things up without evidence:

  -------------------------
  Let's see. Please tell me if I got anything wrong.
    David Baratier's letters and poems have appeared in the Denver Quarterly, editor Bin Ramke, professor, University of Denver.
  Baratier is editor of Pavement Saw Press, in Ohio, which gets money from Ohio taxpayers in order to establish, according to Pavement Saw Press's mission statement, a "non-university affiliated press" which helps Ohio's economy by attracting outside attention and publishing "works of national signifiance."
  Dana Curtis, Ph.D. University of Denver, wins Pavement Saw Press Prize, picked by Ramke. Curtis is founder & editor-in-chief of Elixir Press, based in Denver.
  Jake Adam York, director of creative writing, University of Colorado at Denver, and Colorado Council on the Arts fellow, wins Elixir Press Prize.
  Sounds to me like university-affiliated Denver is the cat and the Ohio taxpayers are the cream.
  It looks like, so far at least, there's a nice little Denver system in place here. Very nice.
  ----------------------------------------------
  Ok, Back to my side again
  The above written by Cordle is a total fabrication.
  York and Curtis didn't know each other
  in fact, at the time Dana was in Minneapolis, not Denver
  I did not know Bin except for asking him to judge the contest and
  I asked him because I called to find out if they were going to run a interview I did with Simon Perchik (which appeared as a feature in an early issue of Jacket) and while he was on the line I asked if he would be interested.

  I'll just stop here. The whole thing is starting to bother me again. Our contest is blind judged, the manuscripts are stripped of the name and publication credits, if we can afford a judge, the judge is sent 25 manuscripts out of all recieved. If not I end up judging the batch I am sent back from the readers. If I am able to afford publishing two books (1000 run each) from the entries I do. Then we pay to mail everyone at least their entry fee worth of books we have published. I think we run one of the fairest contests there is, I challenged Cordle to come up with a place that did better. I am still waiting.  Anyway, my experience is that we would have something false written about us with no evidence, and once that material appeared on the foetry website it became my job to "prove him wrong."

  I should also mention that Levine is one of our authors. And that (for the record, as to avoid more wild speculation) his book won our contest before Tupelo was publishing.

  I also do not see why Levine being accused of a problem with the way he runs his press should affect the acceptance of his poems into journals. This is heading into an ugly direction, what is next? Will AGNI apologize about publishing poems if a poet is accused of running a red-light? Maybe AGNI should apologize for all of the poems they publish until they get a spine.

  Considering the student teacher problems with poetry awards and with contests who have chosen a winner beforehand, my amazement with Cordle is how inflated he is over the little he has revealed.



Be well

ness, soul, spirit) and how it relates to=0Athe "outer cosmos" of the physi=

 initial reaction to watching "The Secret" was that it was a failure as art=
,  and often had the tone of an infomercial, but still had a message worth =
hearing, and that is our thoughts create our reality and if we take respons=
ibility for everything that happens to us, everything, see what inside us a=
ttracted that event, we can only gain. McClure, in his poem "Rare Angel" ha=
d a great line: "We swirl out what we are and watch what returns." Now we s=
hould understand McClure's sources as Science, Whitehead and Hua Yen Buddhi=
sm, among other things. Not new age.=0A=0ADuncan had Theosophists for his a=

icesradio.org/Tracking_Fire.html   A more detailed version of that intervie=
w will be published this summer by Lou Rowan's Golden Handcuffs Review. Bla=
ser said in his essay The Fire that "the real business of poetry is cosmolo=
gy" and Olson stated in Projective Verse that he wanted to discuss what "st=
ance toward reality" bring such verse into being. Coming out of Whitehead, =
as illustrated by Blaser in his essay on Olson called "The Violets," and Sh=
ahar Bram in his book "Charles Olson and Alfred North Whitehead: An Essay o=
n Poetics," this would seem to refer to a shift from a Newtonian/Cartesian =
(Materialistic) model to one that sees reality as Organismic. The world is =
not like a clock, but is a single system, an organism.
 Reality is not THINGS, but EVENTS and the relationship between different e=

I'm not "undervaluing the importance of aesthetic conerns in poetry" I'm
just not talking about that. It's not the subject I introduced here. If you
don't care about the issue of editorial choice in re: to people's lives
 (try to think about it in re: to say, the Bolligen Prize controversy with
Pound decades ago to get a grip on what I'm saying), that's fine. But I'm
not interested--at all-- in talking about the quality of poetry in AGNI,
the the quality of poetry these days in general, poetry contests, Foetry,
what you think of Christian Wiman or any of that. It's boring and leads
nowhere. So adios.


Jason Quackenbush wrote:

Actually, rather than DARING to submit work to Agni, i'd never BOTHER to
submit work to Agni. the fact that they would publish a poem as boring as
the
stuff Jeffrey Levine writes is far more damning of their editorial policy
than whether or not they take into account the poets' extracurricular
activities. You say several times that Agni is a respected journal.
Respected by whom? I don't give a rat's ass about Agni, so i should be upset
by
their editorial policy just because they sell a lot of copies? Poetry sells
a lot of copies too, does that make them respected as well? Even though
Christian Wiman wouldn't know a good poem if Walt Whitman rose from the
grave and hand delivered it to him pressed in gold leaf and stating
unequivocally that "this is a good poem?" Not that he wouldn't take uncle
Walt's word for it, I'm sure he would, but i doubt he'd know it was a good
poem.

I'm being a bit facetious, but i really do think that you're undervaluing
the importance of aesthetic concerns in poetry. I think Agni's aesthetic is
far more oppressive than any correlary like the post you quoted from Foetry.
Incidentally, could you line me to the Levine controversy so I can
understand what he's accused of? I think the whole idea of poetry contests
is a little degrading and stupid, to be honest with you, and as such have
never really cared for foetry's distinction between "good" contests and
"bad" contests. All contests are bad for the art form I think, and the
people
who participate in them ought to be shunned. As such, I think I'm maybe more
in agreement with this aspect of Agni's editorial policy than I am with
their general idea of what constitutes a "good" poem.

Dear all,

After a good run in our lovely DUMBO office, Archipelago Books will be
in need of a new space beginning July 1st. While we would certainly
prefer to stay in the DUMBO area, budget considerations leave us very,
very open to other locations. If anyone knows of an open space --shared
or otherwise-- that would accommodate two full-time and two part-time
folks on a small budget, please contact me!

Archipelago Books is a 501(c)3 not-for-profit organization.

This is not a very good poem and it is much too long.  I hope nobody reads it but other poets on this list.  It's nice that Obama once tried to write a poem.  But his beautifully written book Dreams From My Father is much, much better writing than we have here. Regards, Tom Savage

The poetry of Barack Obama, aged 19

Pop

Sitting in his seat, a seat broad and broken

In, sprinkled with ashes,

Pop switches channels, takes another

Shot of Seagrams, neat, and asks

What to do with me, a green young man

Who fails to consider the

Flim and flam of the world, since

Things have been easy for me;

I stare hard at his face, a stare

That deflects off his brow;

I'm sure he's unaware of his

Dark, watery eyes, that

Glance in different directions,

And his slow, unwelcome twitches,

Fail to pass.

I listen, nod,

Listen, open, till I cling to his pale,

Beige T-shirt, yelling,

Yelling in his ears, that hang

With heavy lobes, but he's still telling

His joke, so I ask why

He's so unhappy, to which he replies...

But I don't care anymore, cause

He took too damn long, and from

Under my seat, I pull out the

Mirror I've been saving; I'm laughing,

Laughing loud, the blood rushing from his face

To mine, as he grows small,

A spot in my brain, something

That may be squeezed out, like a

Watermelon seed between

Two fingers.

Pop takes another shot, neat,

Points out the same amber

Stain on his shorts that I've got on mine, and

Makes me smell his smell, coming

From me; he switches channels, recites an old poem

He wrote before his mother died,

Stands, shouts, and asks

For a hug, as I shink,* my

Arms barely reaching around

His thick, oily neck, and his broad back; 'cause

I see my face, framed within

Pop's black-framed glasses

And know he's laughing too.

Underground

Under water grottos, caverns

Filled with apes

That eat figs.

Stepping on the figs

That the apes

Eat, they crunch.

The apes howl, bare

Their fangs, dance,

Tumble in the

Rushing water,

Musty, wet pelts

Glistening in the blue.

All best,

I suppose you're going to have to figure out how alternative american
buddhism and western study of the religions and philosophies of
ancient asia are?

me, but not in the ways this conversation seems to assume, also, a lot
of this is in drafts for DEA and LOTUS and a hymnal project  -- I'm
really not interested in Blavatsky outside the religious revival in
upstate NY that spawned mormonism, theosophy, and christian science,
and really more interested in women-lead utopian communities from
1600-1800 in the US, but you will see that a lot of these same ideas
continually return

mary baker eddy's hymn lyrics are really right up there with Wesley's
child beating ones

as the five chinese books as a warm up for getting back to real poetry
but doing a lot of floor refinishing instead

oh yeah and I ws briefly an astrologer; paper craft is partically
dedicated to my friend wendy cohen who consulted on tarot for dummies

and I bought my copy of jack spicer at the bodhi tree, same place my
dad bought his fave "find your leprechaun spirit guide" book

foetry and discussions around it bring out the way that the value some
place on the coterie and the usefulness of movements or schools comes
into conflict with art and publishing in the academy and with what is
called "po biz"

what foetry did in a valuable way was make public what many knew and
many did not, which was that winning certain major prizes and
garnering certain publications is about who one knows and who one
studied with, the entire quid pro quo inherent in any business, except
that unfortunately some people think the aura of art somehow conquers
the business of publishing and education, which it doesn't; I think it
ws valuable that some of this ws divorced from the poetry book
publication raffle process, but of course the guy's gone a bit far if
no one whose work is recognisable can enter any contest (though I will
say that AGNI has struggled with dubious submission processes for as
long as I can remember -- remember when they charged a reading fee for
all submissions?)

but I think one thing it hasn't done is make people think about the
coterie and the publishing collective, which could really use some
examination; you know, it is pretty hurtful to be outside them, since
they are exclusive, self politicing / self praising little cells of --
increasingly -- capitalism, or at least po biz

 "I also do not see why Levine being accused of a problem with the way he
runs his press should affect the acceptance of his poems into journals. This
is heading into an ugly direction, what is next? Will AGNI apologize about
publishing poems if a poet is accused of running a red-light? Maybe AGNI
should apologize for all of the poems they publish until they get a spine."

THANK YOU David, for understanding the gravity of this situation. And yes, I
agree completely about Cordle and his embittered miltia--why do they have
this power to meddle and defame?  Are poets in general just too frightened a
group to stand up to it?  It's quite amazing about AGNI--is Sven Birkerts
afraid of what some librarian and his five followers think? Who's next?

Here is what I just posted there in re: to their new blood-sport with
Levine's poetry. I won't provide easy links to the Foetry site because they
don't deserve any more publicity than they've gotten already.


DEFAMATION - "An act of communication that causes someone to be shamed,
ridiculed, held in contempt, lowered in the estimation of the community, or
to lose employment status or earnings or otherwise suffer a damaged
reputation."

If the many personal attacks and false statements made about Jeffrey Levine
were only done by, and only believed by, people on this board, no one would
care. Foetry has long been known to be a peculiar outpost of the online
poetry world where a few bitter, rejected poet-types rattle around looking
for something and someone to destroy instead of working on their own poetry
or doing something creative or positive for the poetry community. The leader
of this group of embittered, defeated people, is not even a poet himself,
not even a wannabe poet, just a librarian with time on his hands, an
inflated sense of moral self-worth, a burning self-righteousness, and lots
of maliciousness in his heart. He enjoys his nasty little games chasing
poets around. Poets! Those super-powerful people in our society who are
super-rich and preying on everyone. Right. One wonders why he doesn't turn
his drive to rid the poetry world of corruption into something that's
related to his own field of library science, something he presumably knows
something about. Why does he insist on meddling in a field beyond his scope
and competence? I suspect it's because poets are so easy to cow with words.
Where else but on the internet could he get away with installing himself as
a "leader" and proceed to incite attacks on other people and/or their work
under the guise of "ethics"?

Everyone who has any experience in the world of poetry knows it's unfair.
Wow! I wonder if that means the whole world is unfair? Gee whiz. The plain
fact is: it is so hard for poets, so hard for poetry to thrive in the world,
the mere existence of this board is offensive. What is its point? To drive
presses and journals and poets themselves even further away from being able
to survive? Is it really so hard to imagine that money is involved in the
field of poetry, that there are those who *deserve* to be paid for their
services, who *deserve* to make a living, just as in any other field? Yes,
I'm talking about Jeffrey Levine, for starters. Mixing the contest up with
his own editorial work--a mistake. Simple and obvious. Evil? Immoral? Are
you out of your minds? It sure wasn't a very crafty way to bilk anyone, was
it? Come on--Levine isn't stupid. But he is HUMAN. And humans make mistakes.
Get over it! Why assume bad intentions? And why assume in your wildest
dreams that Levine would appear HERE and make some kind of apology? And why
in the world does this Christopher Woodman guy assume Jeffrey Levine owes
HIM a personal apology? Talk about calling the kettle black--hubris, indeed!
It's laughable, really. And, by the way, be honest--if that ever happened,
would you all be satisfied and leave it alone? No. What you would say is:
"It's too late, he should have apologized sooner." Or: "He's only
apologizing because it's harming his press/business etc."

But--and this is the issue at hand--whether it was a mistake or not is
BESIDE THE POINT--whatever Levine, or any poet, does in his or her life
SHOULD NEVER BE CONSIDERED WHEN EVALUATING THE POEM. Isn't this EXACTLY what
Foetry itself believes??

If anyone here had both talent in writing and an ability to improve over
time, they would know that there are levels of improvement, that some
editors (and teachers) are able to help writers improve and that some
editors are much better at it than others. There seems to me a direct
connection between those who cannot write and a disbelief in the whole
concept of editing and/or teaching writing. I also see a connection between
the least talented writers and poets and the most inflated egos. Kind of an
'American Idol' phenomenon. I see that here. In fact, people here seem to
think they are editors themselves. They can't understand what an editor
does, what Levine is so good at, what he deserves to be paid for (it's WORK,
folks! And it's a skill you learn through experience), so they thrash around
and come to the conclusion that because they don't know what it is, it must
not exist at all! Then in frustration, they attack his poetry and try to
read it as evidence of a lack of personal or editorial integrity. Apples and
oranges and mangoes. It would be funny, but since Foetry apparently has the
power to influence AGNI's perceptions, it's not funny. AGNI is respected.
Foetry is not. When a respected entity needs to cowtow and act without
integrity for the purpose of pleasing an unrespected entity there is a
serious, serious problem. The only motivation on AGNI's part can be fear of
Foetry, fear of being connected to someone Foetry is against, and/or fear of
selecting a poem by someone they disapprove of AS A PERSON--and that's
WRONG. No matter WHO the poet is or what they have done. Talk about lack of
editorial integrity! AGNI is the epitome of that, not Levine.

As for Foetry--it may have started with a good idea and with good
intentions--to give a wake-up call to poetry contests. It has achieved that
purpose (a purpose intitiated by Cordle to help his wife, a poet who had
trouble winning a contest/getting published). But for the last couple of
years it has been both a hellish and a ridiculous place, an embarassment to
real poets, and now a frightening mob-mentality has taken over. (Though the
"mob" seems to consist of about five or so people with nothing else to do).
This self-serving board still has too much impact in the poetry world and
they've strayed far beyond whatever competence they had, have made the
contribution they will make. Foetry should have disappeared two years ago.
Now, the very idea that a respected journal like AGNI would basically
apologize--to Foetry, no less!--for choosing and printing a poem, because
they have come to disapprove of a poet's actions in another arena of his
life is the REAL final straw. Foetry does not deserve this kind of
influence. Jeffrey Levine does not deserve this defamation of his character.
The poetry world does not deserve to live in fear of a few know-nothing
bullies. Foetry can and will be stopped.

It's been brought to my attention that the recent call for submissions was

Hi, all, this month The Towson Arts Collective will be hosting the 2nd annu=
al Cruelest Month reading series. Check out the press release below...



the Cruelest Month reading series=20
April 5, 12, 19, & 26 at 7:00 P.M.=20
Towson Arts Collective at the Towson Framing Gallery
410 York Road, Towson, MD, 21204
Christophe Casamassima, Curator=20=20

On April 5, 2007, Towson Arts Collective will host the second annual =93Cru=
elest Month=94 poetry reading series for National Poetry Month at the Towso=
n Arts Collective at the Towson Framing Gallery. Each week, we will invite =
a student, a current faculty member from a local University, and poet from =
the community who has experienced prominence (or notoriety=85) to share the=
ir words and exchange views about the act of writing and its function in ou=
r public, private and creative lives. We also encourage those who=92ll join=
 us to bring their praises and complaints: writing, after all, implies a co=
mmunity, and it is necessary for the audience to have a voice, too.=20

=93the Cruelest Month reading series=94 continues the tradition started las=
t year at Towson university. The goal of the series is not so much to enter=
tain the notion that poetry is recognized in the world every 12 months. Ins=
tead, we will unite the act of writing with a community of writers and read=
ers who wish to discuss important topics concerning the state and place of =
poetry in our lives.=20

The readings have no schemata, no prefabricated goals, no ideals but to int=
roduce the people of Baltimore to a critical and literary experience that i=
s lacking in many literary and academic communities. It will function speci=
fically as a locus of readings, questions, and ongoing conversation. Hopefu=
lly, this series will also encourage the formation of new and lasting relat=
ionships. With the revitalization of downtown Towson, this series will kick=
 off a long line of programs, workshops and events at the Towson Arts Colle=
ctive.=20

We will have the poets' books for sale, free chapbooks with the work of the=
 readers, and we will also accept donations of books of poetry for our libr=
ary. We will also be following the readings with a venture away from the ca=
mpus to a local watering hole (for those who wish to continue the explorati=
on).=20

Thanks go out to Ellis Finkelstein Inc.  for so graciously lending us suppo=
rt and donating space for the reading series.

Carol Quinn
...holds degrees from the University of Houston, the University of Missouri=
-Columbia, and the University of Southern California, and is the recipient =
of C. Glenn Cambor and Donald Barthelme Fellowships in Creative Writing.  H=
er poetry has appeared or is forthcoming in Pleiades, The Cincinnati Review=
, Colorado Review, The National Poetry Review, the American Literary Review=

man. He is the author of Gagarin Street (Washington Writers=92 Publishing H=
ouse, 2005). He teaches at UMBC.=20

Joe Roads
A far cry from any late-breaking phenomenon in the music industry lies the =
acoustic poet. Joe Roads, an intensely captivating singer/songwriter, bring=
s his powerful voice to this intriguing genre. With his combination of poet=
ic lyricism as well as a psychedelic blues sound, Joe Roads gained the repu=
tation of being epic and dramatic. What makes Joe Roads a special performer=
 is his intensity, his sincerity and, his passion. Originally from Baltimor=
e, Roads has been compared to Lenny Bruce for his sometimes, satirical and,=
 out spoken approach to his performance. His songs are a melodious journey =
down a rhythmic river. With over 300 songs written in the past 13 years and=
, 10 CDs to his credit, Joe remains one of Baltimore's most prolific songwr=
iters still on the circuit.






April 12=20

Julie Reiser=20

he Pratyabhij=F1=E3-hrdayam. Julie is also a full-time Lecturer in English =
at Towson University where she teaches courses in American literature, comp=
osition, writing for business and industry, and creative writing workshops.=

g Sun and was a columnist for Patuxent Publishing.  She is a contributor to=
 the This I Believe essay series sponsored by National Public Radio. An avi=
d diarist, Joan would like to thank her journal for over fifteen years of d=

Poet, K. Curtis Lyle; and Carnegie-Mellon University , her research studies=
 in Nigeria, Jamaica and Haiti (in relationship to the work of Langston Hug=

pora approach to poetic syntax, theatre direction and curatorial work, brin=
ging image and text together.  A member of Carolina African-American Writer=
s Collective, she was born and raised in St. Louis Missouri on the Mississi=
ppi River.  Her new compilation with Kendra Kopelke and Clarinda Harriss "W=

Elliott Knowles
"Glynn Kylle Plein neither accepts nor denies any connection to Elliot Rand=
all Knowles, or any pomes published under either name.  Any such literary m=
asturbation is beneath Glynn Kylle Plein.  Elliot Randall Knowles is a frea=

Is there a tie(a grip?) between Gingrich's insistence that the United State
does not have to hear or sanction the knowledge of other (i.e. "ghetto")
languages and the Supreme's Court ruling this morning that essentially
sanctions the State (i.e. The Bush Regime) the continued right to hold
prisoners in Quantanamo without a hearing(i.e., the right to challenge their
status) in Civilian court?), and, by extension, the Regime's right to
torture these captives while they are without legal status?

I suspect, by the way, that the new Defense Secretary Gates wants to close
down Quantanamo so that he will not be accused and charged with war crimes -
in the way that Rumsfeld, Carbonne, G Miller and others certainly will, and,
in certain cases, already have been.

Ironically both the Court (Bush et al), and Gingrich share similar instincts
to cut off the tongues of "aliens." What are they so afraid of, and why?
With God on their side! Too!

to open this topic up to poetics, are there writers out there using New
Age or alternative spiritual traditions in their work? I've been looking
at the occult aspects of Spicer's and Duncan's poetry, but I wonder if
there are other streams to investigate, more current ones. what about I
Ching, a la Cage? I guess machine-generated, -altered, work is in a
sense aleatory in similar ways to what the earlier crew were digging
into.

over & out,

tl

-- i wd agree with tom's skepticism regarding the new age or alternative
spiritualities movements -- seems like religion in america often boils down
to a question of -- how can this church improve my life -- how can this
church give me a better deal -- make me more comfortable, more successful --
what have you -- richer -- that's not religion and that sure as hell is not
art, if you ask me -- it's some kind of self-improvement program that
belongs in the self-help section --

-- if ultimate questions of origins, god, can be used to stop wars, end
poverty, remedy homelessness -- that's a whole different ball game -- it's
no longer capitalism plus the protestant work ethic equals heaven on earth
for the white middle class -- instead you get something that might require
real selfless kinds of investment -- and in the end turn out with something
that actually does create peace, end starvation, etc -- make the us govt
stop the war on terror -- feed people who don't have enough money to go to
the store -- as poets and prose writers, reveal the human face of suffering
people -- people the US military apparatus has attacked and exploited and
tortured --

and deception, required a compliant media for support, and so a deal was
struck."

Subject:      Volver meets Shooter
Mime-version: 1.0
Content-type: text/plain; charset="US-ASCII"

Say, if you are interested in male-female splits, a double-bill worth
encountering in one weekend:
Try seeing "Shooter" and "Volver" within 24 hours of each other.
Ron Silliman, of recent, keeps implying that Ed Dorn's work, especially the
later post-Gun Slinger stuff, rightly or wrongly, may be the embodiment of
'White Male Rage'. The shooter in "Shooter" is definitely the embodiment of
rage and paranoia. Righeous marksman - to a fault -  killer with 'good'
cause. Good action movie, but ultimately, deadly 'heroic' skills aside, a
very limited, boring character. Who could spend more than a minute with him
as a person??

Volver, on the other hand (eye), is wall to wall rich movie. Ironically the
guys here are disappeared, or, the one abuser bad guy, killed off early, and
the focus of the film is on the women and the way in which they cope, hide
and/or variously take charge of their lives in response to the consequences
(and secrets) of an originating abuse (male).  Unlike "Shooter" - even
though "Volver" is permeated with apprehension (of 'being found out'),
"Volver's" women provide rich, complex and courageous characters in spades.
I wake up the next day loving this film, and hating "Shooter" and the whole
world and mentality it represents: a 'skilled' heroic male gone
'successfully" amuck big time killing off a bunch of other really fu'ked up
males.  (I really wonder how many the men among us go to such a film as if a
visit to a "foreign world", and/or how many do or wish to identify with its
representation of single minded heroic behavior?? And this is not to deny
the films 'killing grounds' that have defined and grossly legitimized Bush
life and global geography in the last six years)

Whatever constitutes 'gender studies' in this country, someone  could have a
good field day pairing these two. Plus define great art over mediocre junk!

ISBN 978-1-886224-82-7  original paperback, signed edition $20
Publication date: April 15, 2007

This first book of poems juxtaposes contemporary physics, personal =20
and public history, and a passion for the sound of words with the  =20
structural arc of the Roman Catholic mass. The poems invest both in =20
wordplay and in inquiry, wonder, disagreement, dissatisfaction and =20
ethical urgency. This =E2=80=9Cmass=E2=80=9D is attuned to turmoil and =
to the =20
challenges of our day.

=E2=80=9CCatherine Imbriglio was born and lives in Rhode Island. Her =
poetry =20
and criticism have appeared in magazines like American Letters & =20
Commentary, Conjunctions, Denver Quarterly, Epoch, First Intensity, =20
New American Writing, No: A Journal of the Arts, and in The Iowa =20
Anthology of New American Poetries, ed. Reginald Shepherd. She has =20
received an Untermeyer fellowship in poetry and a merit award in =20
poetry from the RI State Council on the Arts. She teaches in the =20
Expository Writing Program at Brown.

=E2=80=9CFormally exploratory as her poems are, poetry is for her not a =20=

formal exercise but a necessity, a way to understand the world and =20
the words with which we know it=E2=80=9D=E2=80=94Reginal Shepherd
=E2=80=9CThis is a smart and wily book of poems, brilliant, clever, and =20=

ISBN13: 978-1-886224-83-4 original paperback $14
ISBN13: 978-1-886224-84-1 original paperback, signed edition $20
Publication date: April 15, 2007

Secret Histories is interested in the way history is constructed as =20
an active engagement with a non-negotiable future, as opposed to the =20
passive receipt of past =E2=80=9Ctruths.=E2=80=9D
      =E2=80=9CSteppe Work=E2=80=9D presents itself as recovered =
fragments from =20
the height of the Mongol Empire, the largest land-based empire in =20
history. =E2=80=9CLast Man Standing=E2=80=9D is offered in the classical =
form of a =20
shepherd=E2=80=99s calendar, counting down the last 12 months of the =
last =20
man alive on earth.  Between and through these sequences, the poem =20
=E2=80=9CPre/Science=E2=80=9D attempts to inhabit a present moment that =
is =20
continually slipping into the layered time-keeping of human =20
consciousness.
      In fragments and disjointed observations, the  book tries to =20
replicate and in fact become the process of =E2=80=9Cmaking=E2=80=9D =
history itself.

      Craig Watson has published ten books of poetry, beginning with =20
Drawing A Blank (Singing Horse Press, 1980), and most recently Free =20
Will (Roof, 2000) and True News (Instance, 2002). Burning Deck has =20
also published After Calculus (1988) and the chapbook Discipline =20
(1986). His poems, essays and criticism have appeared in numerous =20

Written in a pared-down, direct language, and filled with allusions to=20=

everything from philosophy to TV talk shows, the poetry of TADEUSZ=20
ROZEWICZ encompasses the complexity that is human experience in the=20

honed by decades living under communist rule, holds a merciless mirror=20=

up to the crimes and excesses of the poet's lifetime.

Lost to the world for twenty-five years, IVAN BLATNY was, according to=20=

the Czech Ministry of Culture, =93one  of the most significant Czech=20
poets of the twentieth century.=94 Blatny  fled Czechoslovakia after the=20=

Communist coup in 1948,  spending the rest of his life in England. This=20=

volume spans fifty years of his career and is notable for being the =20
first major collection of Blatny=92s work in English,  including=20
multi-lingual poems and some poems written mostly  or entirely in=20

BILL JOHNSTON=92s translations include Gustaw Herling=92s "The Noonday=20=

Cemetary and Other Stories" and Jerzy Pilch=92s "His Current Woman,"=20
among many others. He received the 2005 AATSEEL (Slavicists=92=20

"Dreams and Stones," which is a=A0current finalist for the Dublin IMPAC=20=

If by alternative spiritual traditions and New Age, you include Buddhism, there are many poets who "use" this tradition in their poetry, including myself, occasionally.  Also both Cage's music and his poetry were clearly influenced by Buddhism and possibly Taoism also, although my memory is uncertain about the latter.  Regards, Tom Savage

I think what Catherine is saying is very fair, and I would agree that more
examination of poetry publishing is in order (and doesn't seem to be
happening).

I am not a fan of Foetry by any means (I think the way they run their forums
in particular invites scurrilous and careless gossip, and Alan Cordle would
do better with considerably less heart on his sleeve self-righteousness),
but their core criticism-- that poetry publication and prizes have become
contaminated by rampant cronyism-- is valid.  I can think of at least one
case where they absolutely caught someone with their hand deep in the cookie
jar.

As for Agni, their editors should have policies about this sort of thing.  I
don't know a thing about this particular controversy, but if it is valid and
not just s slanderous rumor (too much of that on the Foetry site) it
deserves to be taken seriously.

I've never sent my poems to Agni-- yikes, they used to charge a reading
fee?  Considering that most manuscripts get read by an unpaid student
volunteer who spends ten minutes tops on reading and stuffing the rejection
slip into the self-addressed stamped envelope, that is pretty brazen.

"All my life I've heard one is many."

I was going to call this "psychecology," but just yesterday I found the
neologism has been claimed (although under Creative Commons license).
Indeed, it has become something of a cosmic joke: each time I arrive at
a conclusion, I find someone has been there before me and I am forced
to reinvent myself
on a neverending spiral staircase anew.

I am a slow man who used to train with members of a team called Tortuga
here in Bloomington.  Having little Latin and less Greek, I do not
understand all of Rexroth's "The Phoenix and the Tortoise," but I know
in my heart the truth of its final lines: "deep in the empty mountain
melts / The snow of Winter and the glaciers / Of ten thousand thousand
years."

What have I learned from what we taught me this spring?

We live in metaphor, metaphor lives in us.
Philosophy in the flesh.
Truths assemble in my honeyed, smoked heart.  What's the line?  Good to
eat for a thousand years?  Truths assemble according to a transversal
logic beyond my ken.  For example: Expatiate to expiate, I once wrote,
because those were the doppelganger words that leapt as in 3-D from the
pages of Charles Brockden Brown.

Now I find myself a father and a son walking a worldly city with which
I exchange letters.  Priorities.  Meandering fathers my thoughts.  But
like Prairie, I do not know my mother, unless she is a cyborg.
Assemblages traverse genres and media.  The theory of assemblage is
itself an assemblage, a phenomenon that illustrates this difficult
truth: we construct our truths upon an infinite, parabolic transmission
or iteration of a diverse array of loopy paradoxes and tautologies.  We
need others to see ourselves clearly, and this includes animals and
machines.  This is what I mean when I say "ecology" and "ethology," yet
others hear only "Heidegger" when I say so.  I have had my fill of
tyrannical theoretical superegos, including my own.  If unitarianarchy
or chaosmosis is starvation, so be it.

If I am dumb, deaf, and blind, who is not a bricoleur, cast the first
stone already.  This is my letter to the world wide web, an information
superhighway.  I ride a bi-cycle, but then again, vehicles are
arbitrary.

R2D2s across the country deliver holograms.  Show me yours, I'll show
you mind.

Three shadows     April 3rd, 2007             The full moon trawls for ice behind Sheffield Centre. She likened it to swimming liquid vinyl, how quiescent bubbles effused solder, how her shoulders slipped out of place, leaving her staggering breathless through a ruddy underbrush, maybe even thatched.
 I was dreaming when I wrote this. I was interfacing with languaged.
 His evasiveness indicates that he has issues with relinquishing control to others. The trees on Clifton blacken and fan. He dreams this night about being prostrate before a car.
 That night of three shadows point me out.
 The same night of Housing Projects from the Seventies.
 She trawls a fur over stumps. She drags behind her those fractions of faces she thought to keep.

I'm writing after the uploading breathing down downloading on your end of
the world, world's end, spatio, world's end, future anterior tempero.

I'm waiting first for the rendering of sexdance w/ Sandy Baldwin. These
are getting increasingly sophisticated, problematic, uncomfortable,
up/loaded. ok this is long but for the first time alien lifeforms appear
on the boundary-level of an alternative world.

life lowers our expectations; life crawls under them.

I'm uploading the rendering of sexdance w/ Sandy Baldwin in Odyssey East
down there by the shoreline where the world falls off, new moves, new
days, new complexities of behavior.

I'm thinking of a theory but the theory falls flat-euclidean. Reading a
biography of Celan, Benjamin's letters, neither help, are of use; they
construct other interiors. China is on the shortwave.

The flat landscape remains impervious, unpunctured. A surface is a surface
with a vengeance. The Dutch mafia. Netherlands on the shortwave.

At one point I tried to construct binary from topology; it doesn't hold,
it slips out from under us. It's twenty-five years after the Falklands
conflict. The Falklands broadcasting service carried on Radio Netherlands.

Byron wrote Heaven and Earth, which is most curious, and The Deformed
Transformed, which I haven't yet approached. Deformation retains more than
vestige of the original:

Every original is a deformation.
Every original is a deformation degree zero.

I get sick of Second Life; I will pack up and move there or move out. I
don't want to live; I want to create. Living in any life is useless,
exhausting, takes away from one or another realing. People suffering from
Trauma from the Falklands. 250 died in the conflict, but 400 committed
suicide.

Well it isn't poetry, but it is a great Canadian poet. Darren
Wershler-Henry's book on the history of typewriting gets some attention

Murat,

thanks for your kind note.  i have here some photos of slain iraqi children
from the war.  their bodies dressed in their own blood, and torn cloth.
they died.  they are gone.  it has to stop.  what is american poetry if it
ignores things like this?  can it claim to be spiritual in anyy sense at
all?  just my questions.

thanks for previously mentioning your translation of Ece Ayhan, excellent!

best,

heidi

back picking dandelion greens.

I am not sure that I will be accurately answering this thread as Duncan was much more based on mythos than I usually enjoy (but I appreciate his sense of the line and durative, over line, breath) and Spicer does not hit me as being spiritual whatsoever in fact his poems are emptied of that resin.

  But they both had poetics written behind their work that suggested spirituality. So are you looking for suggestions of poets who have a spiritual poetics? Those whose poetry deals with spiritual or religious elements? Those who use poetry or spiritual ritual or practice within their poems (like mentioning it)? Or those who use poetry or spiritual ritual or practice as a process to form their poems?

It seems that some "use" spritiuality as a means to create, as a =

method.  Others use the images of their sprirituality in their work.  =

Are you asking about the method or the message?
Anne Waldman's work shows that American poetry can be spriritual (in =

her case buddhist) and political at the same time.  As do many =

others.  =

As far as "new age" influences in their work, Robin Blaiser also uses =

a touch of occult mythos.  Hannah Weiner was thought to be clairvoyant =

and  "saw" words in the air that she included in her poetry.  Lady =

Gregory went into a trance and dictated poetry to Yeats(, although =

that's hardly recent.)  Automatic writing might be said to be "new =

age" as it attempts to delve into the subconscious.  =

I saw the scratch n sniff at AWP, and I want everyone to know how
envious I am.  I mean, John Waters had the first scratch n' sniff
movie, but scracth n sniff poetry -- especially ORANGE scrtch n sniff.

Waters wanted his film to be in the tradition of Willim Castle.  I
hope that poetry containing enough static electricity to literally
shock consumers, poetry whoopee cushions and joy buzzers, ... didn't
someone already do a poetry book with 3d glasses?  I always wnted to
do one of those.  At Sundnce, Adobe displayed some prize-winning
stills that were 3d.

Berkeley Reading:

POETRY FLASH PRESENTS!

Mary  Mackey
Rochelle Ratner
Corinne Robins
Eileen Tabios

Friday,  April 13, 2007, 7:30 p.m.

at Berkeley City College
2050 Center Street,  between Milvia and Shattuck, Berkeley

There are two public parking  garages (right next door and across the
street). You also may take BART since  the venue is one-half block from downtown
Berkeley BART.

Mary Mackey is a  novelist and a poet. Her tenth novel, The Notorious Mrs.
Winston, has  just been published. Her new book of poetry, Breaking the Fever,
her  fourth, was published in 2006. Dennis Nurkse says of it, "Most poets seem
to  write poetry with the will, relentlessly suppressing every part of
themselves  that isn't ecstatic. Mary Mackey writes as a whole person---mind and
senses---and the poems are marvelous."

Rochelle Ratner has published  fifteen books of poems, most recently
Balancing Acts, (2006), Beggars  at the Wall, (2006), and House and Home, (2003).
She's also published  two novels, Bobby's Girl and The Lion's Share, and she's the
 editor of an anthology, Bearing Life: Women's Writings on Childlessness.

Corinne Robins is a widely published art critic and art historian as  well as
a poet. She's the author of The Pluralist Era: American Art  1968-81 and of
five books of poems, most recently Today's Menu. She  coordinates the reading
series Poets for Choice in Brooklyn, New York.

Eileen R. Tabios has published fifteen collections of poems, a volume of  art
essays, a poetry essay/ interview anthology, and a book of short stories.
Her most recent books of poems are Dredging for Atlantis, (2006), and  SILENCES:
The Autobiography of Loss, (2007). In fall 2007 she will  publish the
multi-genre collection The Light Sang As It Left Your Eyes. A  budding vintner, she's
Poet Laureate for Dutch Henry Winery in St. Helena,  California, and is
assiduously researching the poetry of wine.

David,
I've never thought of Spicer's work as being either "spiritual" or "emptied"
of spirituality, but the latter seems accurate enough. Curiously, it doesn't
seem incompatible with his embrace of magic, dictation, etc. Where does one
end and the other begin?

I agree -- there's something empty in his and Duncan's "ceremonial =
robes," yet the fact that they're draped as they are is interesting by =
itself. on the other hand, the purely occult writings of Aleister =
Crowley and the Golden Dawn folks get old real fast, even though there's =
a kind of oddness to them that can be artful.

not sure if I am looking for any "true practitioners" of a spiritual =
poetics (mostly 'cause I don't know what that means -- Gerard Manley =
Hopkins is the most "spiritual" one I can think of, in a mainstream =
religious sense, though not overtly church-dominated). I can imagine =
there's some really awful neo-pagan writing out there, though this, =
along with other faith-inspired texts, is probably ghettoized within =
each group's own canons (in the Eastern Orth. sense of the word).

as for me, a few years ago I started writing "charm poems" -- short =
pieces that invoke a spirit related to physical objects, whether to act =
on them in some way or to otherwise change a situation... I wasn't under =
any illusions that this would have a real physical effect, but something =
about the focus on a single object in the exercise appealed to me.=20

so, for instance, I wrote a series about a loose tooth that was due to =
come out:=20

tooth come out
light

tooth come out
stone

tooth come out:
nothing more to bite.

so, re: Iraq and other injustices in the world: what happens if poets =
write such focused pieces with the overt intention of changing events =
through the power of the words? if you want to try, go ahead: only don't =
get caught up in whether or not it will work, as I feel the "magic" is =
in the ritual, not in the outcome.

or is this true of all poetry?=20

check out this passage from the Finnish epic, the Kalevala: =
http://www.sacred-texts.com/neu/kveng/kvrune09.htm (sorry about the =
translation -- 1888 attempt to recreate the original Finnish meter) -- =
the only way V=E4in=E4m=F6inen can heal the wound inflicted by his iron =
axe is to learn the original spell that created its metal... a kind of =
sympathetic magic at work.=20

can we try to "rewrite" history in our time by singing about what got us =
into this mess?  could this be what Blake was doing with his prophetic =
books, relative to the crap going on in his time?=20

Audibleword.org, seeks critical essays, commentaries, and reviews on
oral and aural poetries with an emphasis on the 20th- and 21st
centuries. Contributions related to American Modernist poetry,
Ethnopoetics, the Black Mountain School, New York School, and more
recent experimental poetry are particularly welcome. Featured authors
at Audibleword include: Cecilia Vicuna, Charles Bernstein, Rachel Blau
DuPlessis, John Taggart, and Martin Espada.

The pervasive digital distribution of poetry audio (and development of
archives and portals such as PennSound, the Electronic Poetry Center,
and Ubu Web, not to mention literary podcasts) suggest that the
contexts for reception of poetry are undergoing a shift.
Contributions are sought which will help shape the reception and
critical discourse for aural poetry.

- close-listening of poetry performance events
- critical scholarly essays
- reviews and hyrid genre commentaries (esp. as related to the featured poets)
- methodological discussions and theorization of transcription,
documentation, audio editing and presentation

We will consider first web publication of pieces that have previously
appeared in print only.

----
About the Site: AudibleWord.Org promotes the appreciation and study of
oral and aural poetries of the twentieth and twenty-first centuries.
We aim to make performance documents in digital media freely
accessible to students, teachers, scholars, and artists.  In
collaboration with contemporary practitioners, as well as critics and
educators, we also seek to create an  informative context for the
appreciation of this work by publishing original commentary, archival
scholarship, and other relevant documents.

What's difficult about spiritualist/spirituality writing is its propensity for sentimentality and kitsch on one hand, and our cultural cynicism, skepticism etc. about even the possibility of transcendent meaning on the other (especially in the poems we read and write).  I find HD's Trilogy to be especially relevant o this discussion.

Might be of related interest to look at what Coleridge has to say
about "Poetry and Religion." See Lecture VIII of his criticism
(1811-12), from which:

"I have heard it said that an undevout astronomer is mad. In the
strict sense of the word, every being capable of understanding must
be mad, who remains, as it were, fixed in the ground on which he
treads -- who, gifted with the divine faculties of indefinite hope
and fear, born with them, yet settles his faith upon that, in which
neither hope nor fear has any proper field for display. Much more
truly, however, might it be said that, an undevout poet is mad: in
the strict sense of the word, an undevout poet is an
impossibility...."

Best,

Fellow poets-

You may or may not have heard that I have been put in charge of poetry. It
is a temporary measure, just until we can come up with a solution to some of
the challenges poetry currently faces.  I want you to know that I know what
an incredible responsibility this is, and I will do my best to account for
the variety of opinions and aesthetics represented here.  In fact, I would
like to think of the recipients of this message as a sort of cabinet--an
inner circle, if you will--advising me on how best to govern poetry during
my tenure.

Obviously we will need a manual to reference while we work together in this
vast undertaking, a sort of common starting point, and I have decided, at
least for the time being, to assign THE BIRD HOVERER, which can be ordered
here: http://www.blazevox.org/bk-ab.htm  Now the notion of using a book of
original poems as the official manual for poetry might strike some as odd;
indeed, a case might be made that a traditional reference volume, or an
annotated anthology, might suit our purpose more effectively. However, THE
BIRD HOVERER is *my* book, representing my own unique aesthetic priorities,
and as such it would seem to be mandatory reading to prepare all of us for
what lies ahead.

Again, I know that my executive role was not assigned lightly. I will do my
best to respect the office and to keep in mind the concerns of my
constituency. Toward that end, I will employ an "open door" policy, fielding
correspondence from anyone who needs my opinion on matters of policy and
governance. All I require in return is that all of you immediately
familiarize yourselves with the manual so that our discussions will reflect
unity--or at least an aspiration toward unity--rather than the clamor and
chaos that characterized the previous administration.

In closing, I salute each one of you: your implicit hopefulness, your
immeasurable talent, and the revolutionary spirit you bring to
poetry-related tasks on a daily basis are what makes poetry *poetry*. What I
want more than anything else is to function as a catalyst for what you are
already doing. The present is bright. Let's work together to make the future
even brighter.


My best wishes,

Aaron Belz

 POETRY FOUNDATION PRESENTS


 FIRST-EVER JOINT READING BY U.S. AND BRITISH POETS LAUREATE





 Donald Hall and Andrew Motion to give series of poetry readings in


 Chicago, Washington, D.C., and London





 CHICAGO &#0151; The Poetry Foundation, publisher of Poetry magazine, is
pleased to announce that it will host U.S. Poet Laureate Donald Hall and
British Poet Laureate Andrew Motion in a series of poetry readings in
Chicago, Washington, D.C., and London. The transatlantic presentations
mark the first time two sitting laureates have shared a stage and will
take place on May 7, May 10, and June 6, respectively. The readings are
co-sponsored by the Library of Congress and the London-based Poetry
Society.





 What:


 First-Ever Joint Readings by U.S. and British Poets Laureate Donald Hall
and Andrew Motion





 When/Where:


 Monday, May 7, at 6 p.m., Fullerton Hall, Art Institute of Chicago





 Thursday, May 10, at 7 p.m., Coolidge Auditorium, Library of Congress,
Washington, D.C.





 Wednesday, June 6, at 6 p.m., St. Giles-in-the-Fields Church, London





 All events are free and open to the public, but reservations are strongly
encouraged; call (312) 787-7070.





 The U.S. and British Poets Laureate reading series is part of the Poetry
Across the Atlantic program, an initiative to reacquaint the poetries of
America and the United Kingdom. Both poets will read their own work as
well as important works by their contemporaries. The talks will focus
largely on each laureate's understanding of his country's most
significant poetic voices&#0151;both established and emerging&#0151;that
may be unfamiliar to readers overseas.





 "These historic readings will promote critical awareness of, and a shared
readership for, the contemporary poetry written on both sides of the
Atlantic," said John Barr, president of the Poetry Foundation, in making
the announcement. "The Poetry Foundation is pleased to be in partnership
with the offices of the U.S. and the British Poets Laureate in renewing
an old and integral friendship."





 King James I established the office of "poet" in Great Britain for Ben
Jonson in 1617, although the title "poet laureate" was not used until it
was conferred on John Dryden in 1670. Historically, it has been the job
of the British poet laureate to write poems commemorating state occasions
or events related to the monarchy.





 In the United States, the Poet Laureate Consultant in Poetry to the
Library of Congress serves as the nation's official lightning rod for the
poetic impulse of Americans. During his or her term, the poet laureate
seeks to raise the national consciousness to a greater appreciation of
the reading and writing of poetry. The position has existed under two
separate titles: from 1937 to 1986 as "Consultant in Poetry to the
Library of Congress" and from 1986 forward as "Poet Laureate Consultant
in Poetry." The poet laureate is appointed annually by the Librarian of
Congress and serves from October to May.





 ******


 Poetry Across the Atlantic


 In addition to the U.S. and British Poets Laureate reading series, the
Poetry Foundation is working to raise awareness of and interest in poetry
on both sides of the Atlantic through a variety of activities and
partnerships with other leading poetry organizations around the world.





 For the second year in a row, the April issue of Poetry magazine is
devoted to the art of translation. The issue showcases an incredible
variety of talent, featuring new translations of classic authors such as
Rimbaud, Horace, Dante, and Neruda, as well as poets relatively unknown
in America, like Mexico's Coral Bracho and Korea's Jin Eun-Young, by
renowned authors such as Robert Pinsky, Charles Simic, J.M. Coetzee,
Rosanna Warren, and Paul Muldoon. In the coming months, subsequent issues
of Poetry will publish a series of in-depth portfolios on the
contemporary poetry of countries including India and Italy.





 This also marks the first year that poetry in translation will be
included in the comprehensive archive of classic and contemporary
English-language poetry available at the Foundation's website,
www.poetryfoundation.org. Over the coming year, the Poetry Foundation
will be adding poetry from Indian and Italian poets as well as from other
major international poets who have influenced American poetry, such as
Pablo Neruda, Czeslaw Milosz, Gabriela Mistral, Odysseus Elytis, and
George Seferis.

cultivated early in childhood and reinforced thereafter. In 2006, the
Poetry Foundation appointed Jack Prelutsky as the nation's first
Children's Poet Laureate. The laureate serves as an advisor to the Poetry
Foundation on children's poetry and engages in a variety of projects
designed to instill a love of poetry among the nation's youngest readers.





 Now in its second year, Poetry Out Loud: National Recitation Contest,

great poetry by offering educational materials and a dynamic recitation
competition to high schools across the country. For more information on
these and other programs, please visit www.poetryfoundation.org.

Announcing two new books from Essay Press:

Kristin Prevallet, _I, Afterlife: Essay in Mourning Time_

	&

Albert Goldbarth, _Griffin_



On Prevallet:
Much admired by her contemporaries for her experiments in poetic
form, Kristin Prevallet now turns those gifts to the most vulnerable
moments of her own life. In doing so, she has produced a testament
that is both disconsolate and powerful. Meditating on her father's
unexplained suicide, Prevallet alternates between the clinical
language of the crime report and the lyricism of the elegy.
Throughout, she offers a defiant refusal of east consolations or
redemptions. Driven by "the need to extend beyond the personal and
out the toward the intolerable present," Prevallet brings herself and
her readers to the chilling but transcendent place where, as she
promises, "darkness has its own resolutions." According to Fanny
Howe, here elegy and essay "converge and there is left a beautiful
sense of the poetic itself as all that is left to comfort a person
facing a catastrophic loss." Forest Gander calls I, Afterlife "the
quietest and most intimate book by one of our best poets."


On Goldbarth:
"These are a whole new breed," Robert Atwan writes of Goldbarth's
essays. "Albert Goldbarth has spliced  strands of the old genre with
a powerful new gene and the results are miraculous." In Griffin --
that crossbred creature comprised of eagle, lion, and serpent --
Albert Goldbarth joins two essays to form one animal. "Roman Erotic
Poetry,"written on the cusp of a friend's divorce, explores that
strangely compound beast we call marriage. "Wuramon," written on the
cusp of a friend's struggle with  cancer, considers that strangely
compound being every one of us is: an amalgam of spirit and physical
body. The resulting book is eccentric, learned, and moving.


Essay Press books are $12.95 and available through Small Press
Distribution (www.spdbooks.org) or directly from the publisher

I've been attending Ojibwe language tables for more
than a year, and I have been learning a lot about
Anishinaabe spiritual traditions.  It has had a
profound impact on me, though I don't know how that
will impact my writing.  It does make me think about
other writers, such as Joy Harjo, as her work is
infused with Mvskoke spiritual traditions.  Are you
interested in considering Native American spiritual
traditions?  I think they are fundamentally different
than "New Age," but I'm not sure what you mean by
"alternative spiritual traditions."  Non-Christian
beliefs?  Wiccan?  Paganism?  Atheism?  Physics?
Theosophy?  Sun Ra?

Hi everyone,

Just a brief plug for Ryan Daley's new book ARMORED ELEVATOR just out from =
BlazeVox. Ryan is a helluva good young poet and his book is well worth the =
dozen bucks I hope you have in your pocket!  You can buy it here:

http://www.blazevox.org/bk-rd.htm

And the blurbs (below)!

Michael Magee
http://www.comboarts.org


In ARMORED ELEVATOR, Ryan Daley writes like a traveler who's never seen an =
airport in his life. Opening a crummy suitcase, he "release(s) the Diaspora=
 / from the citation" it received in an outr=C3=A9 lewd" fist fight and goe=
s fugitive. The Earth we wander with him is "a wormy bot" where Jeremiad mo=
rphs into "the new jingo" and "there's no ice cream to cry into." But fear =
not! Daley speaks the pidgin of many a safe haven and after hours joint. A =
bad fit for the "coterie of alphabetical choir guys," he's our best hope fo=
r finding the real murderer.=20

=E2=80=93Michael Magee

Ryan Daley is a dedicated dodgem of syntax. He is a multi kulti Mayan in Ne=
wark whose wit=E2=80=99s as Pan-American as any Jose O=E2=80=99Shay=E2=80=

Subject: I've been put in charge

Fellow poets-

You may or may not have heard that I have been put in charge of poetry.
It
is a temporary measure, just until we can come up with a solution to
some of
the challenges poetry currently faces.  I want you to know that I know
what
an incredible responsibility this is, and I will do my best to account
for
the variety of opinions and aesthetics represented here.  In fact, I
would
like to think of the recipients of this message as a sort of cabinet--an
inner circle, if you will--advising me on how best to govern poetry
during
my tenure.=20

Obviously we will need a manual to reference while we work together in
this
vast undertaking, a sort of common starting point, and I have decided,
at
least for the time being, to assign THE BIRD HOVERER, which can be
ordered
here: http://www.blazevox.org/bk-ab.htm  Now the notion of using a book
of
original poems as the official manual for poetry might strike some as
odd;
indeed, a case might be made that a traditional reference volume, or an
annotated anthology, might suit our purpose more effectively. However,
THE
BIRD HOVERER is *my* book, representing my own unique aesthetic
priorities,
and as such it would seem to be mandatory reading to prepare all of us
for
what lies ahead.=20

Again, I know that my executive role was not assigned lightly. I will do
my
best to respect the office and to keep in mind the concerns of my
constituency. Toward that end, I will employ an "open door" policy,
fielding
correspondence from anyone who needs my opinion on matters of policy and
governance. All I require in return is that all of you immediately
familiarize yourselves with the manual so that our discussions will
reflect
unity--or at least an aspiration toward unity--rather than the clamor
and
chaos that characterized the previous administration.=20

In closing, I salute each one of you: your implicit hopefulness, your
immeasurable talent, and the revolutionary spirit you bring to
poetry-related tasks on a daily basis are what makes poetry *poetry*.
What I
want more than anything else is to function as a catalyst for what you
are
already doing. The present is bright. Let's work together to make the
future
even brighter.=20


My best wishes,

Aaron Belz

Growing up in small town Wisconsin, foreign languages were an
elective & consequently after school.  Being that I lived way out in
the sticks my parents refused to ferry me back & forth to take
classes, especially since I was a self-proclaimed communist & wanted
to take Russian.

dear alex.  yes, very lucky to have such an interesting mom.  you can see
one of her sculptures with a spider on its eye at
http://picasaweb.google.com/gabwelf/MomSculpture/photo#5050107962204621602.
her mother took her to london from shanghai when she was 15, and she won a
scholarship to the london polytechnic.  she'll be 89 in a couple of
mondays.  we take her to yoga at redwood gardens senior housing in
berkeley.  my sister told some chinese residents there that my ma had
lived in shanghai, and they surrounded her all talking at once.  she still
understands mandarin and could answer them.  we were floored.  :-)  thanks
for the kind words.  best, gabe

Dog,

I thank God that you are temporarily in charge.  I hope your tenure is =
most
glorious and I send my pro-rated Faith towards abolishment of any sort =
of
mutiny, or the mere unconscious thought manifestation thereof.

The manual is a many leveled splendor of painful comedic metaphor.  It's =
the
perfect springboard.

Don't be so modest! Poetry has long needed an Alexander Haig.

Since there was no answer on this thread I'll take my own bent, which is the poems have to exude spirituality through reading.

  Gerritt Lansing, the first book especially, the "pre-curriculum of the soul" version of Heavenly Tree Grows Downward.

  John Unland--The sea beneath the house

  Jack Gilbert-- Monolithos

  Sheila Murphy: Incessant Seeds, its one I published, an experimental meditation on spirituality.

  Maj Ragain-- A Hungry Ghost Surrenders his Tacklebox-- another one I published, poems themselves are a narrative spiritual, friend of Duncan & Dorn.

  Arthur Sze: The red-shifting web

  Niedecker-- T&G, if you can get this from a library, Williams original illustrated version substantially adds feeling to the poems.

  Various collections by George Quasha,
  most collections byTed Enslin & Cid Corman

  all I've time for--



Be well

David Markson's newest book, *The Last Novel* is just out from Shoemaker
Hoard. Except for a few hours work, and dinner, I was unable to close this
book, which I purchased today, until the last word. It is unquestionably one
of Markson's greatest works, an incandescent, elegiac, aphoristic, gnomic
masterpiece, satirically and  hilariously critical of human cruelty, yet
passionately, reverently and knowledgeably reflective of human
accomplishment throughout history. His other works include *Wittgenstein's
Mistress*, *Reader's Block* and *This is Not a Novel*.

A few tidbits:

"He who writes artistically dies without recognition or reward.
Complained Lope de Vega- in 1609"


"Our father who are in heaven/Stay there.
Requested Jacques Prevert."


"I am no Einstein.
Once said Einstein."

"It's later than you know.
Printed Baudelaire on the face of his clock- after having broken off its
hands."

I think the problem is, "I don't know much about spirituality in poetry,
but I know it when I see it" -- can't one experience a spiritual
response to a poem that isn't technically spiritual?=20

my original question had to do with writers whose own (alternative)

great to see these names, as well as those proffered by others this

"my original question had to do with writers whose own (alternative)
spirituality infused their work."

well, CA Conrad certainly strikes me as someone who qualifies, especially
with his astral projection and other spiritual thingees (technical term)
perhaps he can come forward and say a thing or two about this

Dear Bflo list,
=20
Poet Lance Phillips just passed on this message on how to order the =
newly produced Here Comes Everybody anthology (co-edited with Geoffrey =
Gatza) with a request to pass on the message due to a hard drive crash.=20
Thanks,
Deborah Meadows
=20
Here:
 =20
Listen everybody I'm hoping you all can do me a favor.  The HCE =
anthology is finally (this finally is directed at at none other than =
yours truly) available.  There's info about how to obtain a copy at =
http://herecomeseverybody.blogspot.com =
<https://exchange.csupomona.edu/exchweb/bin/redir.asp?URL=3Dhttp://hereco=
meseverybody.blogspot.com> .  Geoffrey Gatza deserves all the credit on =
this he got the book finished with no help from me (in addition to being =
a procrastinator the last nine months or so have been very difficult for =
me).  The favor I have in mind is this.  In addition to everything else =
going on our hard drive crashed a couple of weeks ago and I lost some =
things including my HCE email list.  I'm trying to pick it out of a =
rather long back-up document but its not going well.  I have been able =
to retrieve some emails, yours among them.  I hoping you all can spread =
the word about the anthology either by forwarding this email to whom =
ever you think would be interested, by posting something about the =
anthology on your blog or a listserv or just by mentioning the anthology =
to a couple of friends. =20

Tom L, and by extension, list --

I want to rescind my response on this thread, as it was in response to this
(I had John Cayley in mind and mentioned some of my own work)

to open this topic up to poetics, are there writers out there using New
Age or alternative spiritual traditions in their work?

no where do I read in this question, this one

my original question had to do with writers whose own (alternative)
spirituality infused their work.

my own work (including my astrology!) is not founded on any spirituality or
infused with any spirituality, while it does use main line as well as
alternative traditions, including religious ones

when one looks for spirituality, especially with Spicer, start carefully
examining inspiration.  Ann Lauterbach has some interesting things to say
about inspiration, too; interestingly to me, one also starts looking at
symbolism, the early science / alchemy blue (and Blake to Will Alexander,
Eshleman, Olson & the Maya, don't forget Lamantia!!!)

if you want to look at mysticism, which is certinly alternative to the main
line within any religion, and Judaism, Adeena Karasick's translation of the
sefer yetsirah and Nathaniel Tarn's lyrics for the bride of god --

one of the most troubling aspects of the new age religions as well as of the
contemporary rhetorical separation of spirituality from religious belief and
practice, and the perhaps blur of the definition of spirituality into a wide
range of things -- including chance, consciousness, design, structure, etc.,
which are directly involved in making digital works -- is the way exoticism
has been entwined with multiculturalism and tolerance has been confused with
agreement

Happy Good Friday

A friend from Germany, Martin Kloss--multimedia programmer extrordinaire--is
visiting Santa Monica 04/19 to 05/19 and is looking for accomodation.

He says:

"I'll be in Los Angeles, to be precise Santa Monica from
04/19 - 05/19, and as this is a spontaneous thing,
I'm now looking for places to stay without spending
the millions I earned with Lingo coding."

Not. He goes on to say:

"So if aynone knows someone who knows someone who's
looking for a temporary roommate or can you recommend
affordable accommodations in Santa Monica, I would
really appreciate it. Time is running out and any hint
will help. I've looked at http://losangeles.craigslist.org
and other sites, but the average >$2K / month is a little
steep for my budget."

Martin helped me with Arteroids and On Lionel Kearns. His sites are

Please backchannel me at jim@vispo.com if you can help.

Subject:      Roberson & Shockley at SPT next Friday 4/13
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; format=flowed

Small Press Traffic is pleased to present a reading by
Ed Roberson & Evie Shockley
Friday, April 13, 2007 at 7:30 p.m.


Ed Roberson joins us in celebration of his seventh book of poems, City
Eclogue, out last year from Atelos. Nathaniel Mackey has said of his earlier
book, Atmosphere Conditions, winner of the National Poetry Series:
“Atmosphere, omen, memory, lost amenity, homelessness of more than one sort,
dream, social entropy, music, dance, death--these are among the matters
which move through the poems with revenant, mercurial dispatch. Conceptually
rich as well as technically inventive, these poems advance a wary measure, a
wise, beautifully gruff, ongoing music. They haunt while being read and well
after, refusing to settle.”

Evie Shockley is the author of The Gorgon Goddess and a half-red sea, both
from Carolina Wren Press. Of the latter, Harryette Mullen writes:
“Navigating against prevailing currents, these poems sail on eddy and
backflow, taking inspiration from knots and twists of American history and
culture. Her gallery of lyric portraits presents a historical continuum of
African Americans caught in double binds of culture and identity …Shockley’s
firm grounding in history adds weight and depth to her observations of the
recent past and present.” Shockley teaches at Rutgers University.


Unless otherwise noted, events are $5-10, sliding scale, free to current SPT
members and CCA faculty, staff, and students. ?

Unless otherwise noted, our events are presented in?Timken Lecture
Hall,?California College of the Arts ?1111 Eighth Street, San Francisco

FROM THE INTRODUCTION
-----------------

"No question is so difficult to answer as that to which the answer is
obvious."
    George Bernard Shaw


Ten Question! Lance Phillips asked the same ten question so as many writer
as he could email and those that responded, and respond they did, became one
of the hottest websites in the early days of blogging. A wildfire of
excitement grew. Lance had what we call a YouTube a moment of capturing the
right idea at the right moment. And this book is a gathering from that site.
The idea is of course not new. These 10 questions originally came from a
French series, "Bouillon de Culture" hosted by Bernard Pivot. It is probably
more familiar to many as the question James Lipton asks at the end of
"Inside the Actor's Studio." I've found these questions interesting among
friends. It's amazing what the simple answers to these questions reveal
about a person's thoughts, feelings and beliefs.

Presented are 130 writers, each with their own 10 questions and their
answers. These questions are disarmingly simple steps towards attaining a
knowing, a greater understanding of person as poet. We also get a rare
glimpse at how each brain wraps around a seemingly obvious question. Each
author creates a charming portrait of themselves in their answers. Each
writer comes to their craft in their own way and here we have a splendid way
to engage each writer, in their own words, on a level playing field across a
large strata of information. Here comes everybody, indeed.

This book conducts itself away from the interactions of a collection of
interviews. There is only the author and their reaction to the questions at
the moment in time they were asked them. Many of these are from 2003 through
2005. And so the biographic texts that accompany each set of answers are
deliberately left in their 'as-is' state.

Also included in this volume is the reactions from friends, remarks made on
this website in the days following Robert Creeley's death. This one poet
influenced so many .... it is hard for me, even today to find the proper
words one has to say to get out what it is that this section is supposed to
do. The world no longer has a Creeley in it. This is a record, more or less,
a portrait, maybe, a snapshot of sorts of grief. A reaction of artist for
their artist, friend, mentor, father . so on. Here are questions, interviews
and poems submitted by Ed Smith, Joseph Lease, Chris Stroffolino, Jim Ellis,
Brent Cunningham, Elizabeth Robinson, Ann Lauterbach, Linh Dinh, Joel Lewis,
and Ken Rumble.


I hope you enjoy this book as much as we have had in putting it together.
This is a captured frame of text in a wonderfully creative time. There is
war, a troubled government, a thriving internet culture, a wonderfully
safe/anonymous economically devoid environment to create our poetry. As the
title wrongly indicates, here is everybody, if you are not in this edition,
you will certainly appear in one of our upcoming editions of this series.

Subject: message from Lance Phillips on Here Comes Everybody anthology

Dear Bflo list,

Poet Lance Phillips just passed on this message on how to order the newly
produced Here Comes Everybody anthology (co-edited with Geoffrey Gatza) with
a request to pass on the message due to a hard drive crash.
Thanks,
Deborah Meadows

Here:

Listen everybody I'm hoping you all can do me a favor.  The HCE anthology is
finally (this finally is directed at at none other than yours truly)
available.  There's info about how to obtain a copy at
http://herecomeseverybody.blogspot.com
<https://exchange.csupomona.edu/exchweb/bin/redir.asp?URL=http://herecomesev
erybody.blogspot.com> .  Geoffrey Gatza deserves all the credit on this he
got the book finished with no help from me (in addition to being a
procrastinator the last nine months or so have been very difficult for me).
The favor I have in mind is this.  In addition to everything else going on
our hard drive crashed a couple of weeks ago and I lost some things
including my HCE email list.  I'm trying to pick it out of a rather long
back-up document but its not going well.  I have been able to retrieve some
emails, yours among them.  I hoping you all can spread the word about the
anthology either by forwarding this email to whom ever you think would be
interested, by posting something about the anthology on your blog or a
listserv or just by mentioning the anthology to a couple of friends.

Thanks,

Lance

  Catastrophic Thought


  Its relationship to toggle, totter, topple:
  from binary relationship to abject destruction
  veering
  extremities, 'things' carried to an extreme
  thought that short-circuits itself, goes nowhere
  flatness, worlds without direction
  defuging of worlds

  always self-canceling
  using, devouring energy
  it's too difficult to think

  not the thought of the catastrophe
  there's no therapeutic or suture
  there's no projection, only introjection
  this is introjection without absorption
  blinking, unblinking, uncomprehending
  thought of the catastrophe already grasps
  thought is already thinking
  catastrophic thought is not thinking
  thought which is not thought

  catastrophic thought is physiological thought
  its limit thought on the borders of the conceivable
  in catastrophic thought nothing is conceivable
  in catastrophic thought there are no limits

  laughter, diabolic laughter
  catastrophic thought is the thought of the symptom

  thinking which eliminates the premise of thought
  thought which eliminates thinking
  thought of the i am that i am
  mute thought, inert thought, thought of the thing
  the thing thinking

  the catastrophe "what a catastrophe!"
  the disaster "what a disaster!"

  catastrophic thought A, then B, else B
  towards B, else B, towards B
  B becomes nameless, B is already nameless

  the subject undergoes, is undergone-ing, introjection
  inconceivable projection, nothing to project
  no projectors

  thinking the skein holding everything together
  thinking the collapse of the skein
  just beneath the surface there is no skein
  just beneath the surface there are no things
  there are no surfaces, there is no surface

  thinking which is deeply, inherently, mute
  unspeakable thinking, unspeaking thinking

  physiology of tremors, depressions, tremblings
  phenomenology of nightmares, hysterias
  suicidal thinking, thinking which produces limit
  thinking suicide, the production of a thing

  thoughtless, witless
  not always the worst, however, always mute

  "i can't think of this, this catastrophic thought

I can see many ways that my writing would relate to these questions and =
think they're great questions to answer. They touch on a lot of the =
basic aesthetic issues I've thought and talked about all my life. I can =
answer them for literature and for music.

Hello All, I am forwarding this call for submissions.

This is a beautiful little magazine/book to hold in your hands,
made in the way of binding with the string on the outside and
the pages folded. I am afraid I do not know the terminology for
Japanese binding.





Dear readers and correspondents,

This is to let you know that I have started reading for the next NOON
(#5, due out in September), and that I expect to be able to accept
submissions until approximately the end of June. Feel free to send
via email if that's more convenient for you.


There are few remaining copies of NOON 4, more of 2 and 3. Please ask
for details if you'd like to purchase a back issue. (I can give no
better guidelines.) Likewise, if you'd like to subscribe. The
magazine receives no other funding than my own and that of subscribers.

Best wishes,

Philip

Hello, Friends,

I have started a new little journal on dvd format called Rabbit Light Movies.

They are very short poemfilms of poets reading from their work.
There are three poets (three films) per episode. Each episode is limited to 99 copies.
Each episode is also free.

Episode #1: Noah Eli Gordon: 5 poems
                   Julie Doxsee: The Knife-Grasses
                   Joshua Marie Wilkinson: Wolf Dust

Episode #2:  Sawako Nakayasu: 2 poems
                    Kate Greenstreet: from [Salt]  (from case sensitive)
                    Andrea Rexilius: from Gravity / Hem

I have about 20 copies of Episode #1 left; Episode #2 is hot off the press and I can
start sending them next week.

If you would like an episode, please feel free to email me your name and address and I'm happy to send you one or both (please specify which or both).  rabbitlightmovies@gmail.com

[international: I think the dvds are region free and I'm pleased to send one anywhere]

If you are interested in submitting audio for consideration, there are some guidelines
posted at http://rabbitlightmovies.blogspot.com

They are low budget little movies and they're for you.

New episodes will feature Jaswinder Bolina, Allison Titus, Mathias Svalina,
Sommer Browning, George Kalamaras, Lily Brown, Bin Ramke, Joshua Poteat,
c. marie smith, Joshua Kryah, Jon Woodward, Eleni Sikelianos, and many others.

Also: In the new Criterion Collection set of Paul Robeson films, one of the movies
included co-stars H.D.  Yes, H.D. I think it's called Borderline.

Hi, new to list. Lurking about, reading mostly. Favor? The 25 questions came
through like this on the digest form:

SXQgd2lsbCBiZSBmYXNjaW5hdGluZyB0byBhbnN3ZXIgdGhlc2UgcXVlc3Rpb24sIGluIG15IG9w

and so forth.

Any tips on turning that into a human language? A setting I missed? Is there
a plain text issue here? Flummoxed. Apologies for any bother.

All thanks,
Si

hi all,

i'm sure i'm not the only one wondering who the poets suing and
threatening over this now-pulled anthology are and what are their
reasons. if you're one of the people who has caused this anthology to
be pulled if you can share with us why i'd be much obliged.

thanks,

I am with David. It would be interesting to have this point discussed, be it
front/ or back/channel. I know that Lance has invested much into it, and I
think, as I was notified, that he got in contact with all those who took
part in it before publishing it. The book is already out also thanks to
Geoffrey Gatza's work, why pull it back now, isn't it too late?
What is the difference between being published online and being published in
a book?

Thanks to those who are directly involved and will explain their position,
Anny

Well Geoffrey, if you would have asked, I would have been very happy to be a part of your anthology. Poets suing--that is ridiculous.

It is absurd and I'll do my best to explain. I will not tell any names as to
not harm anyone in relating what has happened. We do good work here and are
not trying to get sued!

Several problems arose in the first 12 hours after an announcement was made.
Lance and I have been working on this as a book for over a year and a half.
Maybe more. Anyway, we thought we had all the permissions in hand. We did
not.

Two poets threatened to sue me and the press if we did not remove their
entries. I consulted our lawyers and they said to just stop the whole
project.

We had several poets concerned about permission to use their words. Some
angry others just protecting themselves and their ideas. One forgot if they
did give permission, but this is still a problem.

Another problem raised was payment to the contributors.


Print on Demand is a book made when someone orders it. The base price for
HCE is 12 dollars. This is the most expensive text we have as it is 740
pages. Amazon takes 60% of the 29.95 book price. That leaves us 1.95
remaining for Lance and I to get rich off of.

We are a poor press and this book works out as such. A solution would be to
provide a one copy payment to the 130 authors. This is way beyond our
budget, actually more than our budget for the next 7 years. This is a huge
text, 740 pages and our base cost is 12 per book and to ship this to 130
people would cost us $2210.

We don't have that kind of money and we should have realized at some point
that someone would want one. So it would be better to use these resources in
a better fashion, as this is a webpage and it's 'out there' already.

I have offered a book deal to Lance so as he is not 'out' anything.

Thanks to everyone concerned and BlazeVOX will come out on top on this and
continue to offer high quality, relevant texts!



Best, Geoffrey

If you know of any mentoring, tutoring, part-time teaching, or visiting artist
positions, in the areas of new media, video, film, or English, please let me
know. I'm currently teaching a filmmaking course at Brown, which will be coming
to an end in May; my students are doing amazing work. I can get references,
recommendation letters, and so forth. I wouldn't be asking on email lists, but
I'm relatively out of the academic loop at this point.

Thanks greatly, Alan

A few things, photographs, haptic drawings and commentary:

1. Philip Guston's Ghost(s)
While out walking, I am sometimes haunted by the ghost of the work of Phili=
p
Guston - or is it, as well, the actual presence of the artist himself? Whic=
h
is to say, whatever I remember of seeing Guston=B9s work - and I have seen a
great deal - the work, or some aspect of the spirit of the work,
periodically transforms itself to reappear in the form of something local,
something material...

2.  =B3Derelict=B2 Proclamation, Noe Valley, San Francisco
TO WHOEVER PUT THAT UGLY
SIGN LAST NIGHT DESPARAGING
DERELICTS...

3.  New York City "Haptic"
Haptic:
Pertaining to the sense of touch, from the Greek word haptein, to grasp.

Sporadically, in the past year, I have been exploring environments through =
a
drawing technique that I call Haptics. The pieces are not =8Cdrawings=B9 in any
conventional sense - perspective, volume, figures and all of that. The
drawing is built around listening closely. Instead of haptics the pieces
might equally well be called "soundscapes..."

4.  What Suzanne Stein Did! Performing at Small Press Traffic, San Francisc=
o

Suzanne Stein - poet and performance artist - created what might be called
=B3a presence=B2 (rather than a =8Creading=B9 or =8Cperformance=B9) to an audience of
primarily poets last Friday night at Small Press Traffic. The event was a
combination of =8Coff-putting=B9, =8Cembracing=B9 and =8Cthought provoking.=B9...

And, by the way, Happy Holidays!!

you could probably bookmobile (or some other digital short run printer) just
130 copies for way less (I'm guessing 7 dollars per, including set up
costs), and then use pod for regular order fulfillment; or,

you could redo the permissions process, and allow interviewees to buy
however many copies at cost (I know that I for example, like to have 2-5
copies of anything like this I'm in, to sell at readings, give to my folks,
etc., and at least 25-50 copies of books, and I don't really care if they
cost money or not, but it becomes a real consideration when I have to pay
list price -- say 29.95 rather than cost, say 3-10 dollars)

also, I know it is a pain, and I don't know if you've paid an initial set up
cost already, but pulling a dozen interviews will make it a little
shorter/cheaper

All best,

of private recordings, made in 1962-1972, whose existence had not
previously been known. Sieburth provides a detailed essay to
accompany the recordings, which cover Pound's two major recording
sessions, at Harvard in 1939 and in Washington, DC, in 1958. In
addition, we include Pound's 1942 reading of Canto XLVI, broadcast on
Italian radio as part of his radio speeches; Pound's reading at
Spoleto in 1967; Pound's reading of his "Confucian Odes" (Spoleto,
1970), and a private recording of three Cantos from the early 1970s.

We are grateful to New Directions Publishing Corporation and the
heirs of Ezra Pound for making these recordings available for
noncommercial and educational use. As with all PennSound recordings,
these file are downloadable MP3 sound files.

PennSound was launched on January 1, 2006 by Charles Bernstein and Al
Filreis. We are currently making available about 8,000 MP3 files and
continue to expand rapidly. In the last year, over eight million
individual sound files were downloaded from PennSound.

Other recent additions to PennSound include the complete recordings
of William Carlos Williams, and extensive collections of recordings
by Jackson Mac Low, Susan Howe, Anne Tardos, Anne Waldman, Myung Mi
Kim, Charles Reznikofff, Alan Davies, Tracie Morris, Bruce Andrews,

Porter, Robert Grenier, Mei-mei Berssenbrugge, Allen Ginsberg, Brian
Kim Stefans, Kenneth Goldsmith & many others. We also host two poetry
radio programs, Close Listening, with Charles Bernstein; and
Cross-Cultural Poetics with Leonard Schwartz. Al Filreis hosts our

I'd like to hear these "poets" explain themselves as well. For what it's
worth, I (would have) appeared in the book, and the first I heard of the
book project was on this list-- I hadn't granted permission or been promised
any money. And do you know how I felt when I heard about the book? Pleased,
of course! It didn't occur to me for a second to get angry at Lance for not
getting permission or, good god, to sue. This is yet another example of the
dire effect of commerce, with its built-in notions of ownership, on poetry--
the free exchange of ideas has been foiled by greed and a perception of art
that's completely beholden to commerical imperatives. There is nothing
benign to me about "protecting what one owns" when it comes to artistic
creation, although so many take it for granted that it is-- I just see white
picket fences trimmed with concertina wire. The whole thing makes me feel a
bit depressed and angry. I'd love to hear an explanation, but I really can't
think of one that would justify mobilizing the ponderous US judicial system
against a small poetry press. What sort of poet would submit willingly to
such a soul-demolishing and art-compromising enterprise? Not any that I'd
call poets. Poetry is one of the few remaining spaces for personal freedom!
So by all means, let's litigate against it for impinging on the rights
granted us the mental enslavement of capitalism.

Happy Zombie Day

What Catherine says about redoing the permissions process seems reasonable. Probably the permissions process was handled a little too informally. What you should do is draw up a formal permissions letter, setting out terms that do not include payment or free copies but should include an authors' discount. Then make a somewhat smaller volume out of the interviews with those who make a positive response to this within a certain time frame.

  On the other hand I wouldn't moralize against the people who want to prevent their interviews being reprinted. They probably regret something they said and don't want to disseminate it any further. We all say stupid things we regret sometimes, things we wish we could erase from the record. And to some extent we have the right to try and do this.

however many copies at cost (I know that I for example, like to have 2-5
copies of anything like this I'm in, to sell at readings, give to my folks,
etc., and at least 25-50 copies of books, and I don't really care if they
cost money or not, but it becomes a real consideration when I have to pay
list price -- say 29.95 rather than cost, say 3-10 dollars)

also, I know it is a pain, and I don't know if you've paid an initial set up
cost already, but pulling a dozen interviews will make it a little
shorter/cheaper

I emailed Geoffrey when I got the publication announcement yesterday.  I =
don't consider myself an ingrate.  I would have liked to know about the =
publication in advance.  I would have also liked to the opportunity to =
read proofs.  My interview depended on links.  It wasn't intended for =
print, and I'd have to reconsider it in the light of that.  Perhaps Lance =
contacted me and I have somehow forgotten it, but I don't think so.  The =
question of how work is presented is still a live one for me; I think =
notification and permission are pretty basic.

I didn't threaten to sue of course & that seems an overreaction. =20
But still, courtesy is appreciated, even needed, where publication is =
concerned.  Probably lots of people spent some time on these interviews, =
as I did.  Maybe even designed them specifically for a web context too.  I =
think that should be respected; maybe an appreciation for individuality =
has been lost because of the large number of poets involved.  Lance's =
questions were the same, but the responses were individual.

Barry says it perfectly, and Catherine. It is a pity though because the book
is already out, that is the only point that hurts. Maybe those who pulled
back are willing to rethink their positions? Both for Lance and Geoffrey, I
think they deserve more than this. Those who are not interested won't buy
the anthology and won't put it on their CV's, maybe this is not asking too
much - there are so many anthologies out there, it is very unlikely this one
will get to the top of the hits, ...

Parable of the return


Having perfected the machine which allowed us to travel backwards in time,
we decided to visit the very origins of humankind, that savanna where
proto-hominids roamed, beginning their conquest of the flora and fauna of
the planet. We returned to a period before the great dispersion, before
the diasporic spread of humans fearful of themselves.

We brought clubs, knives, guns, explosives; we brought encapsulated germs
and plagues. Around eleven o'clock in the morning, we appeared on the
savanna. The hominids, tearing a sloth to pieces, were everywhere. They
carried clubs, hand axes, crude knives.

We knew the slaughter would kill us as well. We imagined the arrival of
other intelligent species who might know better, or who would also send
expeditions of destruction into their pasts. We were prepared for death,
an oddly retroactive form of suicide.

We began the slaughter; clubs and knives did not become us. We began
shooting and the hominids ran in all directions. We still survived.

We bombed their gathering places. We killed families indiscriminately. We
released smallpox, measles, plagues of all sorts. We machine-gunned men,
women, and children. We were harbingers of death. And yet we survived.

We checked our demographies; we were at the center of the holocaust We
were the holocaust. We knew one or two might escape; we were prepared for
that. The future, our present, would be transformed. Hominids would either
go extinct or become a minor species with an ecological niche in some
savanna backwater.

We discovered this: We changed evolution utterly. We changed it towards
ourselves, the most violent of the futures of the hominids. The ones that
escaped would live to slaughter others. It was slaughter that guided them
all along. It was slaughter that created us. For those that escaped,
wounded, life would be constant fury. We had set the script of revenge
into motion. We produced ourselves.

We knew then that attempts to change the past only produced it. We knew
then that there was no escape; life itself would wane as plants and
animals hurtled towards extinction. Our return had created our return; our
return from the botched journey produced at best a botched species. We had
only ourselves to blame; our ancestors, each and every one, were innocent,
following the path we had set for them.

We knew then that we followed the same path, that we were determined as
well, produced by the circularity of our return. We were at the birth of
the wounded, the birth of indiscriminate slaughter. We were at our own
birth as well. We understood that there was nothing to do, nothing to be
done, that death was always in the doing, that violence was mandated from
our own beginnings. We knew then that we would die soon, just as others
died, fellow travelers back in time, fellow architects of doom.

MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII

On re-reading Burt Kimmelman's title poem for his book 	SOMEHOW, I was
struck by a strange sense of "process", of "nature" as
physically--identically--"human".

The poem begins in what sounds like a familiar "genre"--a cold February, a
bird is singing "into the thin/early/light" ---almost like rough
indications for a painting, a still life, or Nature Morte.

And there is indeed an implied "still life", but it's not "morte". It's
quite active, an activity imposed through human imgaination:  "red/ and
blue flecks/incising the/day" The birds are calling to each other and
become "raucous/gangs seizing/territory" so that in its entirety the poem
enacts a subtle shift from the potentially "prettified" scene to
inimations of settled aggresssion"

so that
in this most
unforgiving

world their
insistance
is all there is.

From "thin light" to "insistence"--an illuminating insistence emerges and
is modulated by the extraordinary interplay of lines and space in the
rhythmic patterns in a single sentence.

SOMEHOW

Somehow
through the cold
February

a bird

light, its trill
then another

empty but for

the red
and blue flecks
incising the

day and
very soon
the riotous

raucous
gangs seizing
territory

so that
in this most

That's okay, Gabe.  My own case makes me think that there may be others =
interested in proofing, or adapting the text from web-specific to print.  =
It's very difficult to comment on the question of the poets who have =
threatened to sue as we don't have the information necessary to make an =
assessment.  It may be just a case of ruffled feathers, if they weren't =
informed or consulted about the anthology; it may be something more =
serious.  I think, by and large, poets are very generous with their work =
-- I was surprised at the quick rush to adverse judgement here on this =
list. =20

I can imagine a number of scenarios in which someone might *not* be pleased.

What if the poem in question was the very one a particular poet wished
he/she had never published at all and never wanted to have see the light of
day again?  What if it was a poem that he/she felt was over-anthologized and
did not represent well what he/she was currently writing?  What if the venue
was one in which the poet just did not want to be a part of? What if the
poet just can't stand anthologies?

Personally I too would have been pleased to be included in this particular
anthology-- but if some editor at some other press decided to use one of my
poems (horribly misread) for some vile version of 'Chicken Soup for the
Soul", all without asking permission, I might very well get out my guns.

I think it is okay for poets to have feelings about these matters. You have
to make room for the fact that the poet's vision might be very different
from yours.  In any event, asking permission first is good manners.

I think Catherine's suggestion to redo the permissions process is a good
one.  All does not have to be lost.

You're right. I posted in a moment of anger at the venality that has in my
view infected poetry, and overstated my case. What really upset me was the
threat of legal action-- there are so many ways humans can resolve disputes
without surrendering their personal agency to the legal justice system, and
any sort of concession of the will to governmental controls I find
anti-poetic in the extreme. I can understand someone being upset about their
work being reprinted without permission (although this was to be a book of
interviews, not poems). That said, that these poets would go so far to sink
the project entirely on such a basis is very strange to me. I did my
interview for HCE two or three years ago, and while some things I said in it
now strike me as silly... I mean, I said them. I meant them at the time. And
that kind of image-control-- of wanting to disavow embarrassing things I've
said in the past-- seems profoundly dishonest to me. I understand the urge
to control one's public image, but I don't admire it.

Best,
Brian

Hey Geoffrey,

hope yr well. I wanted to let you know about this interview that just
posted:
http://raintaxi.com/online/2007spring/gordon.shtml
It's a pretty long interview & we talk in depth about the book that you
published (thanks!), I'm wondering if you might be willing to forward a link

to the review to folks on yr email list?
I ask because if feels silly when I forward stuff about myself, but since
you published the book, it'd wouldn't seem so odd...

Thanks much!!!

I believe somebody said this is print ond demand. If so, it should be
rather easy to omit the parts where the publishing rights are
questioned, and just publish the rest.

And
that kind of image-control-- of wanting to disavow embarrassing things I've
said in the past-- seems profoundly dishonest to me.

also, if it is that much of a concern, perhaps one should decline
opportunities for publicity, be it interview or poem publication

This was an anthology of interviews, not poems, yes?

I don't know any of the details (note:  I did not even know that this was a
collection of interviews rather than poems) but I would hope that a person
who wasn't happy about having their work included would, ermmmm, write a
nice letter first before running to their lawyer.  That sounds like the
neighborly thing to do.

The whole thing sounds weird.  Did they really not know until the eleventh
hour what was going on?  But who knows?  Miscommunications happen and some
people aren't very organized about reading their correspondence.

I've given a few interviews in my day which I will be very glad to not have
anthologized.  They weren't horrible, mind you--  but they also weren't what
I would consider my best words, and I have changed my mind about a lot of
things over the years.  I can also remember one interview in which the
journalist really did seriously misquote me-- not too much but enough to
radically change the meaning of what I said.

Without getting all hyper about "image control" I would feel that giving
permission to reprint the interview would be tantamount to saying "Hey! This
represents my aesthetic very well and I consider this to be me at my best!"
That's fine if I feel that way, but if I don't feel that way I don't think
it is especially dishonest to say "No thanks. Really, no. I have thought
this over and I don't want to resurrect this."

I had a poet friend once who did a second adavnaced degree in psychology,
writing her thesis on the psychological function of writing elegies--
specifically what writing elegies did for the poet emotionally.  She
interviewed several poets in the process, including me.  It was a great
process, I thoroughloy enjoyed the process, but this is another example of
an "interview" which, if published in the wrong context, would come across
as very misleading about my work.  Remember this was for a  psychology
dissertation, not a literary magazine-- most of the interview dwelled on
autobiography in ways that I would consider irrelevant to the aesthetic
experience of my work.

So you see-- it gets to be a prickly issue.  I can see a lot of different
sides to it.  Maybe some of the people interviewed had no idea that their
off-the-cuff interview was going to be published like this.

Whatever the case, communication really is the key to avoiding these
mishaps. The editorial process serves a purpose. Likewise,, giving benefit
of the doubt and speaking up earlier rather than later about one's wishes
before resorting to lawyers would have made this less painful for everyone.
Honestly I din't understand why it had to come to this.

I hope the solution doesn't have to be so either/or-- that really would be a
shame.

Just my two bits.  thanks for listening.

Without digging deeper into the issue of permissions, I'd like to ask what the difference is in allowing, or not, someone to print the interview in an anthology and allowing it to remain online?  If the interview is not your "best", why leave it online for the world to see?  It probably receives more views over the three years that it's been available online than the entire run of the anthology will ever see.

  And must every interview, or poem for that matter, be our "best" to be in print?  Not our best to be online?

  Just by putting this link here -- http://herecomeseverybody.blogspot.com/  -- on a list of nearly 1,400 subscribers, the site will now, in one day & at minimum, possibly get a hundred plus hits alone today. That is solid reading base of a representation of oneself.

  The first thing I do now whenever I come across a poem by someone that strikes me or when someone recommends a poet's work is to google them and see what I can find online!  Then I'll buy their book if I like their work and lust for more.

Mairead, I just looked at your interview online and there are no links in it--except for the link to your blog at the top of the page and two links each to online publications and publishers' pages for your print publications.

Mairead Byrne <mbyrne@RISD.EDU> wrote:  I emailed Geoffrey when I got the publication announcement yesterday. I don't consider myself an ingrate. I would have liked to know about the publication in advance. I would have also liked to the opportunity to read proofs. My interview depended on links. It wasn't intended for print, and I'd have to reconsider it in the light of that. Perhaps Lance contacted me and I have somehow forgotten it, but I don't think so. The question of how work is presented is still a live one for me; I think notification and permission are pretty basic.

transformations.

This is I think where we descend into hair-splitting.  Yeah, I agree:  I
personally don't see a difference at all, but then I am very much at home
with multi-media.  I think for a lot of people who are less than comfortable
with electronic media, online is less "real" to them.  It doesn't "feel"
like publication.  (I am not offering that as an excuse, but more as an
explanation as to why some people, will not care much about something
online, but suddenly make a very big deal when paper and ink come into
play).

I can also imagine an editor who is very comfortable with electronic media
to interpret permission to publish online as, well, overall permission.  A
publication is a publication.  This is how I would feel in any event.

For me the real issue is if a writer has any objection to any part of the
process why keep quiet until the 11th hour?  I'll assume someone has an
explanation about that, but for now I am scratching my head.

Cheers,

You originally made the distinction that paper means the work should be of value whereas the online work can be less so -- and you're right, some people still hold that view, though I don't think it's just about being abstractly more "real".

  Ultimately, why should anyone be less concerned with something they've published online that is more accessible than print very often?  A representation is a representation is a representation ...

  The notion that a work is better, or more authentic somehow, because it is in print speaks to the more pointed and complex issue of money and capitalism - that system which declares a specific value.  The commodification of the poem, a tangible-paid-for-item, to a certain degree removes the poem from the context of how it functions in the world and reduces it, or re-focuses it, to measures such as what publisher, how many copies sold, what name is attached, etc.  The poem's value then becomes the book and what doors it can open, etc ...

  I'm not saying that's it, that print isolates the poem, but it certainly is viewed through that lens, which is why even poets, who so rarely earn a living from writing poetry, can come undone when it comes to putting a poem in print and turning it into a commodity -- one that will rarely show any monetary return -- because the poem's value is no longer just measured by what the poem itself is doing; it can now be measured by what it will return to the poet.  Just what is the price of that ticket?  Does the poetry finally pay when it becomes currency?  Is the poem no good when it can't give back?

Thanks Barry.  I realized some time today that the links interview was a =
Chicago Postmodern one that I did around the same time.
I'm sorry!  Now my only issue is not knowing about the book until it was =

This makes sense to me.  Is there a reason why this can't be done?  It would
be ashame to have to drop the whole thing.

Armored Elevator by Ryan Daley

Ryan Daley is a dedicated dodgem of syntax. He is a multi kulti Mayan in
Newark whose wit's as Pan-American as any Jose O'Shay's. He knows dystopias
no longer wash unless in global neo-glot soup spracht. Armored Elevator is
one of the best-certainly the edgiest-first books I've read in quite awhile.

homemade traps for new world Brians by Evan Willner


Evan Willner reinvisions fifty states as fifty poems that each have the
flinty, hard logic and formal density of stone slabs-stele or gravestones-or
of teeth. And yet, the language within these poems is palpable and
mysterious and alive, the connection between words and things skew in all
sorts of right ways that end up making everything seem to be wriggling and
formicating on the same level of consciousness: next time you look at
nature, don't be surprised if it gives you a come-hither look back. A must
read for all Brians.

Morphology by Ruth Lepson and Walter Crump

In Lepson and Crump's collaborative improvisations, language becomes a
playful substance in which we find ourselves furtively embodied, "camped out
near a shoulder" or "standing in the middle of a paragraph." Acts of
renaming and comparing create a flux of metamorphoses both ominously curious
and sweetly surprised. These exuberant, synesthetic leaps between the visual
and the verbal bypass unlikeness, pursuing instead a kind of social dreaming
in which everyone is included.

wow, a statement of poetics...

ah lyric/narrative left-justified free verse written by men about
anything in children....

what would "the politics of poetics form?" police thing of that?

anything men in urban (or suburban) children
can be celebrated if it's
"free-justified left verse"
                     and the thematic
                                         re
                             strict
                                                    ion
seems to carry equal weight as the formal....

thanks...

And all this has brought me to read your interview again, Mairead.

What an odd turn of events. My condolences to the editors for all of their
hard work.  I hope the project can be salvaged, and all parties satisfied.

It's a pity to waste all that energy.

A RARE NEW YORK APPEARANCE

The Segue Reading Series Presents

BEVERLY DAHLEN AND CRAIG WATSON

Saturday, April 14, 2007
4PM (sharp!)
at the Bowery Poetry Club
(308 Bowery, just North of Houston)
$6 admission goes to support the readers

hosted by Erica Kaufman and Tim Peterson

Ron Silliman writes, "Beverly Dahlen is the most enigmatic American poet
since Laura (Riding) Jackson. Not that Dahlen is unnecessarily difficult or
obtuse, but that – like Riding – she writes brilliantly, but has also proven
exceptionally reluctant to letting her work into print...Dahlen had helped
to co-found HOW(ever) (now How2) and was already well into writing A
Reading, an "endless" – the term she has used more than once – poem that is,
to my mind, one of the masterworks of the 20th century."

Robert Duncan said of Dahlen, "The psychic life she draws in writing may be
drawn from her own psychic life, but here its body is the text and it speaks
to the psyche of the reader as a reader." Dahlen is the author of The
Egyptian Poems, Out of the Third and 4 volumes of A Reading.  A native of
Oregon, she has lived and worked in San Francisco for many years.

     from A Reading 18

   "therefore I'd be a shadow freed of former hands and execute this mission
of destruction on past lives.
     there is nothing that can be safely brought in to the arena. the body
question. the Frankfurt school in
     a loose coalition with strippers and wombats. he raised the antenna and
the picture cleared. wherever
     two or three are gathered together in my name the project prospers. ego
is now supposed to have
     given way to mercy and light. cracks through which you could drive a
needle

     whatever was the point of organizing the world in this way: the
helpless baby. further evidence: my
     father thought me up fully armed. no consolation there. where does she
arise from the sea or in the
     mountains beyond reason."

**
Craig Watson is the author of Secret Histories, True News , and Free Will.
He works as a producer and dramaturg at Trinity Repertory Company, a
professional theater in Rhode Island.

Andrew Joron writes, "Craig Watson's engaged lyric continues to discover
"more songs in the gaps" of the system; as he traces the antinomies, his
long poems build toward an almost orchestral scale and ordonnance. Fiercely
and deliberately, Watson redesigns the echoes inside such hollow
abstractions as Reason and Free Will, and so allows us to hear, even with
"ears knotted into the wall," the real music of thought."


from "Last Man Standing"

                                                  --January

WOW! This is definitely one not to be missed. Thank you, Erica & Tim, for
putting this together. Every reading I've ever been to by Bev Dahlen (five
now, spread over quite a few years) has been amazing. And Craig Watson is
someone I've wanted to hear read for a very long time.

cheers!

maybe if they're not spiritual or left justified

I did put them up at the bookswap site, which now has some poetry (it is a
ten to one swap situation, I think), although it is still mostly mysteries
and romances -- these are books I attempted to sell on Amazon

I have noticed that mny of the poems are arranged in stanza-like groupings
of equal length, oftentimes without a really good reason to display them
that way

while I hve given hundreds of books to the library, and then to the local
friends of the library I have been extremely disheartened by the
country-wide book deaccessioning that libraries are doing, which is
increasingly focussed on "the classics" which don't get checked out as often
as the new danielle steele while it is new, books on religion and diet,
books with a local focus (for example, the locl branch deaccessioned all its
Gayl Jones, while paradoxically keeping all of the August Wilson plays --
which are now almost ALL of the plays they have -- they have a copy of
Streetcar):  the library doesn't want books like my books on its
shelves, the library doesn't want book donations, they don't even want
donations of *my* books, and they don't want to purchase my books or books
like them.  they have given the branch librarians charge cards to BARNES AND
NOBLE to buy books

[this is a radical change from 98-2001, when the central library had
literally *every* book of experimental poetry they knew about when it was
brand new -- now they don't even buy poetry]

and the same goes for the friends of the library, where they are trying to
sell donated paperbacks for 25 cents, but I don't think they've sold any of
the plays, criticism, or poetry we've donated

we thought about donating everything as a "special collection" of plays and
poetry, but of course then they wanted us to also give them money to catalog
-- all for a copy of, oh some Strindberg play we have multiples of that
they'd wait a year or two to deaccession

1.  The Ritual

Three years ago I cleared this field
dragged the pines and sweetgums
and stacked them at the edge
home now to black widows and hog-nosed snakes
...
I say to the oaks
<i>this stone has traveled one thousand miles</i>
...
but trees already know the heft of stones

Join Archipelago Books & Ugly Duckling Presse for an evening of Czech=20
and Polish poetry...

Bill Johnston, Edward Hirsch, & Matthew Sweney
read and discuss the works of Tadeusz Rozewicz & Ivan Blatny
Wednesday, April 11th @ 7 p.m.
192 Books
192 Tenth Avenue
New York, NY
www.192books.com
Free and open to the public.

Edward Hirsch will introduce the work of Tadeusz Rozewicz, the=20
brilliant post-war Polish poet. Bill Johnston reads from his=20
translation of Rozewicz's three-book collection "new poems"=20
(Archipelago Books, April 2007). Matthew Sweney reads from his=20
translations of Ivan Blatny's work included in "The Drug of Art:=20
Selected Poems" (forthcoming from Ugly Duckling Presse).


Written in a pared-down, direct language, and filled with allusions to=20=

everything from philosophy to TV talk shows, the poetry of TADEUSZ=20
ROZEWICZ encompasses the complexity that is human experience in the=20
early 21st century. R=F3zewicz's unique voice, formed during his=20
experiences as a member of the Polish resistance in World War II, and=20
honed by decades living under communist rule, holds a merciless mirror=20=

up to the crimes and excesses of the poet's lifetime.

Lost to the world for twenty-five years, IVAN BLATNY was, according to=20=

the Czech Ministry of Culture, =93one  of the most significant Czech=20
poets of the twentieth century.=94 Blatny  fled Czechoslovakia after the=20=

Communist coup in 1948,  spending the rest of his life in England. This=20=

volume spans fifty years of his career and is notable for being the =20
first major collection of Blatny=92s work in English,  including=20
multi-lingual poems and some poems written mostly  or entirely in=20
English.=A0 V=E1clav Havel has written: =93The verses and fate of the =
poet=20
Ivan Blatny . . . complete the fate of Czech literature, which=20
transcended the borders of the nation, often struggling for survival.=94


EDWARD HIRSCH is the author of six books of poems. His collection "For=20=

the Sleepwalkers" (1981) received the Lavan Younger Poets Award from=20
The Academy of American Poets and the Delmore Schwartz Memorial Award=20
from New York University. Hirsch is currently the president of the John=20=

Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation.

BILL JOHNSTON=92s translations include Gustaw Herling=92s "The Noonday=20=

Cemetary and Other Stories" and Jerzy Pilch=92s "His Current Woman,"=20
among many others. He received the 2005 AATSEEL (Slavicists=92=20
Association) translation award for his translation of Magdalena Tulli=92s=20=

"Dreams and Stones," which is a=A0current finalist for the Dublin IMPAC=20=

Literary Award.

MATTHEW SWENEY is a former resident of Maine and NYC, now residing in=20
Olomouc, Czech Republic, where he is a teacher, translator and=A0editor.=20=

He has edited numerous volumes of American literature in=A0Czech=20
translation, and is one of the main organizers of Slova bez=20
hranic/Words without Borders, the annual Czech international=20
poetry=A0festival. He is currently working on an=A0anthology of Czech  =
love=20
poetry in English translation. This is his first public performance in=20=

the NY metropolitan area since his punk band broke up in the 1980s.

**Corollary Press**
http://www.corollarypress.blogspot.com/
Corollary Press is small chapbook series edited by Sueyeun Juliette =20
Lee. The press features innovative work by writers of color in =20
hand-bound and letterpressed editions of 150. Corollary has a tendency =20
towards the beautiful, baffling, and unruly in language. You can visit =20
the website to see samples of new work by Corollary authors Bhanu =20
Kapil, Pamela Lu, Christopher Stackouse, Lynn Xu, and Jason Schwartz.

*Performer Bios*

**Jason Daniel Schwartz
Jason Daniel Schwartz grew up in New Jersey. He has lived in New York, =20
India, and rural Massachusetts, which he left with an MFA, courtesy of =20
the University of Massachusets Amherst. He now lives in San Francisco =20
and teaches animal science at Holden High School and writing at De =20
Anza College. His stories have been in Black Warrior Review and Crab =20
Orchard Review. He feels great joy when people say, "go easy on =20
yourself."

**Christopher Stackhouse
Christopher Stackhouse is a painter, draftsman, and poet. He is a Cave =20
Canem Writers Fellow, a Fellow in Poetry from the New York Foundation =20
of the Arts, and a poetry editor for Fence Magazine. His work has =20
appeared in Hambone, nocturne(s), and Aufgabe as well as other =20
journals. He is co-author of a limited edition hand crafted artist =20
book Seismosis (The Center for Book Arts, 2003), which features =20
selected drawings in collaboration with writer John Keene's selected =20
texts. Seismosis Complete Drawings and Texts is out now from 1913 press.

**Lynn Xu
Lynn Xu was born in Shanghai. She is a graduate fellow at Brown's MFA =20
program. Her poems were selected by Anne Carson as the winner of the =20
2006 Greg Grummer Contest: "these have the passionate compression and =20
quick syntactic spring of a John Donne lyric ? [but] the way these =20
disintegrate gently into an imprecision which is sort of raw, but even =20
more thoughtful" (Carson). In the summer Lynn wishes to move away from =20
Providence and closer to water. This will likely not happen. Her poems =20
have appeared in The Canary and Phoebe. June is her first chapbook.

**Frances the Band
http://www.myspace.com/francestheband
http://www.francestheband.com
Pitchfork media describes Frances the Band's music as having "a =20
mysterious, antique feel, like something that might have played as an =20
old carousel spun endlessly by a boardwalk and people walked by at =20
sunset in their Sunday best." Lead man Paul Hogan and friends will =20
make an appearance to charm us with their ditties.

If CNN replays it, the half hour news conference with the women on the
Rutgers Basketball team is worth its weight in gold. Absolutely refreshing -
rarely do you get to see such a demonstration between a totally screwed up,
brutal language (Ismus's) and the demonstration of fact in the language and
physical presence of the women. And no ads breaks in the middle of it.

A delight and more.

Hello, good poetry folks!

Just wanted to drop a little plug--my chapbook, Letters to My Sister, has
just gone to "e-print" with Revelator Press.  The direct link is
http://revelatorpress.blogspot.com/2007/04/letters-to-my-sister.html , and
you may view the chapbook by clicking on the image, which then opens a .pdf=
.

"the blurb":


Composed as a series of letters to a family member serving in Iraq, Angela
Vasquez-Giroux's first poetry chapbook is a vivid evocation of the fear,
displacement, and uncertainty that war imposes on those who are left behind=
.
Through images of fragmentation and fragility=97misreadings of scripture,
partial glimpses of a loved one in a news report=97*Letters to My
Sister*<http://revelator.ofdoom.com/letters.pdf>speaks of the
challenges of survival, both for those in the field and at
home.


I hope you take a moment from your day to check out my work, and the work
being done over at Revelator.  These letters were truly a labor; you can
reach me at angela.vasquez.giroux@gmail.com with any comments, critiques,
"go to hells", etc.

Angela

Subject:      I enter the phrase: Enduring the realm of inherent contradiction.
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII; format=flowed

I enter the phrase: Enduring the realm of inherent contradiction.


Endurance: here, to subsist within for an indefinite period of time. The realm
is that of broken, convoluted, fragmented information. Contradiction references
multiple strands tending towards differing and temporary truth-
tables.Inherent, because this becomes the condition of existence; outside the
realm of language, what is, is, but within the same, mappings are fast-forward,
imminent, and decomposable.

Fragment generates fragment; the goal of the fragment is the fragment;
there is no goal. What happens in the real is the incandescent slaughter-
house; ecologies and bodies burn. The fragment is the life-raft.

The iron-clad fragment protects itself as ideology within the inerrancy of
a text. The text itself is of little matter; what matters is its command-
structure. An inerrant text is absolutist; it brooks no contradiction; it
is nothing but words.

One word follows another; within the fragment, they are deeply untethered.
The inerrant text constructs the digital world; the digital world decon-
structs, destroys, the inerrant text. The construction of the digital
world: from parts and parcels of the analogic, the inert real. The frag-
ments otherwise; the fragment returns to the analogic - is fragment pre-
cisely because of the analogic; in relation to the analogic; within the
analogic. The fragment is the passing symptom; the symptom is the passing
trope; the trope stands in for the raster, the horizon of the digital.

What one says and does is irrevocable.

The fragment is endured; the fragmented is nostalgia for a lost and mythic
coherent.

The fragment leaves the fragment, leaves language and name behind. The
fragment is the dream of the proper name.

"To fragment something" carries the torn world on its shoulders. Contra-
diction seeps from the torn. The hole dreams of the whole; the hole dreams
of the whole dreaming of the hole.

This has nothing, has everything, to do with the slaughterhouse. The
slaughterhouse is the last of the shifters - meat and dwelling of the
shifters. Contradiction: seepage from the slaughterhouse. Slaughterhouse:
the irrevocable torn.

*/ Who carries my voice when I speak? To where and when is it carried? And

this piece is awesomely beautiful. a text that gives compelling pleasure
to the eye, and more, it asserts a broader scope for how words can play
on the mind. 'poetic' and intelligent and heartfelt.

FRED CODY AWARD FOR LIFETIME ACHIEVEMENT
ANDREW HOYEM


Born in 1935 in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, to second-generation Norwegian
parents, Andrew Hoyem graduated from Pomona College and served in the U. S.
Navy. Upon settling in San Francisco in 1961, he became involved with the
avant-garde literature scene. During the early 1960s, Hoyem was a partner in
the Auerhahn Press, the publisher of numerous Beat Generation writers like
John Weiners, Michael McClure, William Burroughs, Philip Lamantia, Philip
Whalen, and Charles Olson. He designed several of the books written by his
friend Richard Brautigan.
        After a nearly eight-year partnership with legendary San Francisco
fine printer Robert Grabhorn, Hoyem struck out on his own and founded Arion
Press. Considered one of the most accomplished printers of today, Hoyem is
also a published poet and exhibited artist who occasionally includes his own
writings and drawings in Arion books. The concepts for all Arion
publications originate with Hoyem, who chooses literary texts, commission
new work from writers and artists he admires, and designs the books,
including their bindings and typography. In the Press's livre d'artiste
series, he has worked closely with distinguished artists - Robert
Motherwell, Jasper Johns, Ida Applebroog, John Baldessari, and Richard
Diebenkorn, many of who come to the Press in San Francisco to work with him
on projects. Individuals, museums and libraries including the Museum of
Modern Art in New York, British Library, Huntington Library, and the Library
of Congress collect Arion editions.

Dear Poetics,

 New from Glossolalia:

TIMBREL, featuring Sabrina Orah Mark reading "Walter B. Needs Some Time" and
"Beatrice Takes a Lover"

Now available for stream or download at
http://glossolalia-blacksail.blogspot.com/

Given that were I forced to choose a favorite book of poetry from the
Aughties, it would probably have to be *The Babies*, I'm surprised it's
taken this long for me to get around to remixing Sabrina. Yet here we are.

One might note that there is no timbrel in the mix. To be fair, there's no
timbrel in the poem either.

Coming soon(-ish, probably): Mixes featuring Laura Carter, Jon Leon, and
Allyssa Wolf.

Best,
Brian Howe

Art show opening saturday, april 14, 6-8pm, at gallery 324 – “between two spirits: Valleys of Virginia”, an exhibition of works by local Cleveland artists Bruce and Geraldine Kiefer.


Photographs and framed assemblages, from $190 - $250, will be on display from April 14 through April 28, 2007.

Gallery Hours: M-F 10 am – 5 pm, Saturday 10 am – 2 pm

For more information:

Gallery 324
The Galleria at Erieview
1301 East 9th Street
Cleveland, Ohio 44114

The title “Between Two Spirits: Valleys of Virginia” is both literal and metaphorical. Literal in that the work was created in the valleys of western Virginia, and metaphorical in that it melds, intersects, and counterpoises the creative spirits of the two artists.

Bruce Kiefer is a fine art photographer. Geraldine Kiefer does mixed-media work. At Gallery 324 they will be exhibiting landscapes from Bath County Virginia where they participate in the Nimrod Hall Artists Program, and other sites in Virginia’s western valleys and ridges.

In these works the literal image is sometimes manipulated in Bruce Kiefer’s work, to create new compositions. Geraldine Kiefer takes Bruce’s prints as the starting point for her meditations that enrich the original scenes.

Parking
There is $1.00 Parking for these events on Saturdays in the Galleria
Parking Garage: enter off Lakeside between East 9th and East 12th. There´s

Is it? Oh, I’m sorry. Sometimes it feels as if my fingers lock up, and  I’m alone on the bed, cupping my rage like my stepfather did, or  sleeping off the annoyances.

It’s the ease that does it. How easy it is for everyone else. The sky  grays out, as if disabled; clicking on that sky brings you nothing. Then  rain furs the bare trees, fuzzing the edges off everything, and it’s too  cold to think. When will Winter leave us alone, or beat us up?

I like one or the other. Not both.

Walking from one room to the next, holding in front of her the copper  rods, waiting for them to cross over water, over pregnancies, over the  dead and their awkward ashes. In this box, note how your memories curl  at the edges, licked by invisible fire, but slowly, almost imperceptible.

It would be a whole lot simpler if we just disappeared. I’d never have  to bloat and blue in an August cold; I’d never have to serrate to dust,  to become aloof to changing. A current of everything happening always  smothers our corposes. Always. they’re in the way.

She remains very calm while addressing me.

I think the best part of Jubilate Agno comes when Smart tells us that if
we all stop what we're doing and applaud, then God will reveal himself
(no doubt bowing to left and right as in an opera by Handel) and the end
of time will be upon us.

  Dear Poets,
      Two ensembles I’m part of will be performing in California in the next couple of weeks as part of our spring tour, and we love it when poets come to see us. They seem to like it as well.
  The Nonsense Company, a trio of musician/poet/actors, performs music and theater with an emphasis on composed speech, investigation of language, and sociopolitical issues. The Prince Myshkins perform satirical cabaret/folk songs (mostly funny and thought-provoking) on a wide range of topics (mostly not funny, though occassionally thought-provoking). Here are some dates, followed by descriptions of what we’re doing. I think some of you may really enjoy this stuff, and we’d love to talk with you about what you’re doing as well.

      “Great Hymn of Thanksgiving” by Rick Burkhardt
Three speaking percussionists, around a dinner table setup (with tuned glasses and bowls, scraping forks, rumbling furniture and meticulously composed group speech), perform this work in which mealtime talk is replaced with news from the war in Iraq, scraps from the Army prayer manual, invented Arab folk tales, the poetry of Rae Armantrout, and “a recurring state of emergency pointing everywhere and leading nowhere.”
    “words without song”—poems by Andy Gricevich
        “Strange Autumn” by Steven Kazuo Takasugi
for reciter, percussionist (playing amplified books), and tape
Issues of irresolvable translation are complicated by impossible sonic landscapes. Writing and speech collide with sandstorms of flies.
      “Conversation Storm” by Rick Burkhardt
In this 40-minute play, three old acquaintances from three sides of the political spectrum argue their way through a hypothetical “ticking time bomb” scenario, brutalizing their own positions in the process. Recent U.S. torture policies infect the form of the play, distorting time and character.
      “Mapuana mai kekahi” by Robert Phillips
for speakers performing on various Hawaiian instruments and percussion. Western musicians encounter the smooth sounds of Harry Hoomele and his Island Orchestra in a ritualistic space that makes an other of anything within it.
         “Song Without Words” by Rick Burkhardt
for prepared guitar, ukulele, accordion and harmonica.
Incredibly quiet and indescribable.

Novelist Kurt Vonnegut dies at age 84 By CRISTIAN SALAZAR, Associated Press
Writer

NEW YORK - Kurt Vonnegut, the satirical novelist who captured the absurdity
of war and questioned the advances of science in darkly humorous works such
as "Slaughterhouse-Five" and "Cat's Cradle," died Wednesday. He was 84.

Vonnegut, who often marveled that he had lived so long despite his lifelong
smoking habit, had suffered brain injuries after a fall at his Manhattan
home weeks ago, said his wife, photographer Jill Krementz.

The author of at least 19 novels, many of them best-sellers, as well as
dozens of short stories, essays and plays, Vonnegut relished the role of a
social critic. Indianapolis, his hometown, declared 2007 as "The Year of
Vonnegut" — an announcement he said left him "thunderstruck."

He lectured regularly, exhorting audiences to think for themselves and
delighting in barbed commentary against the institutions he felt were
dehumanizing people.

"I will say anything to be funny, often in the most horrible situations,"
Vonnegut, whose watery, heavy-lidded eyes and unruly hair made him seem to
be in existential pain, once told a gathering of psychiatrists.

A self-described religious skeptic and freethinking humanist, Vonnegut used
protagonists such as Billy Pilgrim and Eliot Rosewater as transparent
vehicles for his points of view. He also filled his novels with satirical
commentary and even drawings that were only loosely connected to the plot.
In "Slaughterhouse-Five," he drew a headstone with the epitaph: "Everything
was beautiful, and nothing hurt."

But much in his life was traumatic, and left him in pain.

Despite his commercial success, Vonnegut battled depression throughout his
life, and in 1984, he attempted suicide with pills and alcohol, joking later
about how he botched the job.

"I think he was a man who combined a wicked sense of humor and sort of
steady moral compass, who was always sort of looking at the big picture of
the things that were most important," said Joel Bleifuss, editor of In These
Times, a liberal magazine based in Chicago that featured Vonnegut articles.

His mother killed herself just before he left for Germany during World War
II, where he was quickly taken prisoner during the Battle of the Bulge. He
was being held in Dresden when Allied bombs created a firestorm that killed
an estimated tens of thousands of people.

"The firebombing of Dresden explains absolutely nothing about why I write
what I write and am what I am," Vonnegut wrote in "Fates Worse Than Death,"
his 1991 autobiography of sorts.

But he spent 23 years struggling to write about the ordeal, which he
survived by huddling with other POW's inside an underground meat locker
labeled slaughterhouse-five.

The novel, in which Pvt. Pilgrim is transported from Dresden by
time-traveling aliens from the planet Tralfamadore, was published at the
height of the Vietnam War, and solidified his reputation as an iconoclast.

"He was sort of like nobody else," said Gore Vidal, who noted that he,
Vonnegut and Norman Mailer were among the last writers around who served in
World War II.

"He was imaginative; our generation of writers didn't go in for imagination
very much. Literary realism was the general style. Those of us who came out
of the war in the 1940s made it sort of the official American prose, and it
was often a bit on the dull side. Kurt was never dull."

Vonnegut was born on Nov. 11, 1922, in Indianapolis, a "fourth-generation
German-American religious skeptic Freethinker," and studied chemistry at
Cornell University before joining the Army.

When he returned, he reported for Chicago's City News Bureau, then did
public relations for General Electric, a job he loathed. He wrote his first
novel, "Player Piano," in 1951, followed by "The Sirens of Titan," "Canary
in a Cat House" and "Mother Night," making ends meet by selling Saabs on
Cape Cod.

Critics ignored him at first, then denigrated his deliberately bizarre
stories and disjointed plots as haphazardly written science fiction. But his
novels became cult classics, especially "Cat's Cradle" in 1963, in which
scientists create "ice-nine," a crystal that turns water solid and destroys
the earth.

Many of his novels were best-sellers. Some also were banned and burned for
suspected obscenity. Vonnegut took on censorship as an active member of the
PEN writers' aid group and the        American Civil Liberties Union. The
American Humanist Association, which promotes individual freedom, rational
thought and scientific skepticism, made him its honorary president.

His characters tended to be miserable anti-heros with little control over
their fate. Vonnegut said the villains in his books were never individuals,
but culture, society and history, which he said were making a mess of the
planet.

"We probably could have saved ourselves, but we were too damned lazy to try
very hard... and too damn cheap," he once suggested carving into a wall on
the Grand Canyon, as a message for flying-saucer creatures.

He retired from novel writing in his later years, but continued to publish
short articles. He had a best-seller in 2005 with "A Man Without a Country,"
a collection of his nonfiction work, including jabs at the Bush
administration ("upper-crust C-students who know no history or geography")
and the uncertain future of the planet.

He called the book's success "a nice glass of champagne at the end of a
life."

In recent years, Vonnegut worked as a senior editor and columnist at In
These Times. Bleifuss said he had been trying to get Vonnegut to write
something more for the magazine, but was unsuccessful.

"He would just say he's too old and that he had nothing more to say. He
realized, I think, he was at the end of his life," Bleifuss said.

Vonnegut, who had homes in Manhattan and the Hamptons in New York, adopted
his sister's three young children after she died. He also had three children
of his own with his first wife, Ann Cox, and later adopted a daughter, Lily,
with his second wife, the noted photographer Jill Krementz.

Vonnegut once said that of all the ways to die, he'd prefer to go out in an
airplane crash on the peak of Mount Kilimanjaro. He often joked about the
difficulties of old age.

"When Hemingway killed himself he put a period at the end of his life; old
age is more like a semicolon," Vonnegut told The Associated Press in 2005.

"My father, like Hemingway, was a gun nut and was very unhappy late in life.
But he was proud of not committing suicide. And I'll do the same, so as not
to set a bad example for my children."

Simplex 17

On December 7, 2005 I sent the following invitation:
"this is an invitation to participate in a collaborative / constraint-based=
 concrete poetry portfolio. Letraset was created as a business tool for the=
 standardization of lettering in technical drawings and blueprints. Althoug=
h it has fallen out of favour due to the proliferation of computers in tech=
nical drawing, letraset continues to be used in concrete poetry. By assigni=
ng the same material to a variety of international concrete poets and artis=
ts, this project examines how content and form interplay in concrete poetry=
, and will be an insight in to the malleability of language and materiality=
 through different visual compositional structures and styles."

Seventeen poets and artists agreed to participate. Each received a full she=
et of Simplex letraset dry-transfer lettering (every participant received t=
he same typeface, although the size of the face varied due to difficulties =
i had in finding enough sheets) and were restricted to using only the mater=
ial supplied (i.e.: no additional materials), and responses had to fit on a=
 single sheet of 8 =BD" x 11" (or A4 if international) paper.

Simplex 17 contains work by: Bruce Andrews, Jonathan Ball, John M. Bennett,=
 Christian B=F6k, Nicole Burisch, Jason Christie, Craig Dworkin, Geoffrey H=
libchuk, Matthew Hollett, Frances Kruk, Donato Mancini, Billy Mavreas, kevi=

Jesse, I'd forgotten about that part you mention. Smart had this about
clapping hands. He mentions the clapping of hands a few times in the
Jubilate. I had a friend, Tom Andrews, a lovely man who died (2001) when
he was 41. He was a hemophiliac. When he was 12 or so he made the
Guinness Book of World Records for clapping his hands. His mother
admonished him during the middle of the attempt on record, "Are you
clapping your hands for yourself or for the glory of God!" (This is
recorded in his memoir CODEINE DIARY). When I read that, I showed him
this passage in the Jubilate:

"For the CLAPPING of the hands is naught unless it be to the glory of God."

He looked at me with big tears in his eyes.

Gabe

"Let Ross, house of Ross rejoice with the Great Flabber Dabber Flat
Clapping Fish with hands. Vide Anson's Voyage and Psalm 98th ix."

"For applause or the clapping of the hands is the natural action of a
man on the descent of the glory of God."

Hearing Al Sharpton interviewed today I of course
agreed with him when he said, "I wouldn't want to
hear a daughter of mine called a ho."  And he's right
too of course that we have a problem with racism
that runs deep in America.  There's really nothing
he says that I disagree with (Maya Angelou's interview
from yesterday on the other hand!  I'll get back to her
in a minute...), but I just wish we had used this
situation while we had it to use.

Meaning, imagine if Imus were required to take phone
calls all day for a month from an 800 call-in number
from anyone and everyone who wanted to talk about
racism, sexism, and all the other forms of bigotry he
upholds (no one bothers to mention the endless
homophobic comments he makes)?  It's too easy for
us to slap this behavior down, in fact it's the easiest
thing to do. Meanwhile all that's happened is that yet
another bigot has been made to feel ashamed, and
endlessly apologize, as though apologies really mean
anything.  He's just gone underground is all.

What good's an apology when you REALLY listen to
what he said that got him into this mess in the first
place?  I mean the thing that horrified me about his
statement was mostly HOW it was said.  He didn't
say it with any emphasis to be shocking, it was merely
SAID, as it's part of the man's vernacular, part of his
easy everyday vocabulary.

Policing what people say is our shortcoming in many
ways.  What we really need is the courage to allow
EVERYTHING to be said.  Imagine if we really did
allow an 800 call-in number where callers could engage
him all day long, callers who are against him, or callers
who are with him, or a caller who might have some kind
of strange insight none of us had ever thought of yet?
I say we need to have more courage and allow Imus to
PROVE his apology by engaging the country.

Because while I agree with Sharpton's comments he's
really said nothing new.  What he said is said over and
over again and gets us nowhere.  We have a problem
that needs a new solution.  And I'm not even saying that
my 800 call-in is the solution.  I'm saying that this idea
might possibly lead to a better solution along the way.
And it could also be an opportunity for the country to
engage.  HEY, LET'S NOT FORGET HOW POPULAR
THIS MAN IS!  Let his stupidity and the stupidity of his
fans be a pivot for change.

NOW, yesterday's interview with poet Maya Angelou.
GEESH!  Did anyone else hear this?  What rubbish!
What's wrong with her!?  And here I thought just her
poems were awful!  Of course I agree with her that the
situation was shocking, yes, but I'm referring to when
she was asked if suspending Imus was enough action,
and she answered with, "I don't think so, the airwaves
have been so polluted by him, and rappers and Hip Hop!"

Is she out of her mind?  This is the VERY SAME poet
who I'm sure would LOVE to smack down any pro
Patriot Act conversation, yet she calls publicly for
the TOTAL fascist control of the airwaves!  This
"poet" grumbles like any grumpy old granny about
the situation.  That's all she's got?  SHUT EVERYONE
UP, that's the solution?  No more rap, no more
uncomfortable words.  This is a poet?  What?  Since
when are poets afraid of words!?  How ridiculous!

Is she too comfortable with all her accolades now to
be bothered?  What's her deal?  And what EXACTLY
would she prefer to hear on the radio WHILE WE'RE
A COUNTRY A WAR!?  At war in Iraq, and at war at
home against the poor!  Does she want soothing mood
music?  Does she want GOOD FEELING stories about
saving puppies from the edge of swimming pools?  How
nice for her.  Yes, that's lovely.

The thing that irritates me most about her is that she
wants to be known as this activist poet who confronts
injustice so long as she doesn't have to actually expand
the width of her worldview to engage.

Courage it seems is always in short supply.

Although I too dislike most of the poetry by Maya Angelou I've seen over the years, I have to agree with her comment about rap and hip hop.  For over a decade, drug dealers parked on the stoop of my building and forced me to listen to rap/hip hop at all hours of the day and night and I must agree that it's comments about women, gays, and all manner of other abused minorities are horrible.  I was overjoyed when the police finally chased the dealers away and I was no longer forced to listen to this junk.  But, to be honest, she isn't asking for the removal from the airwaves of this bilious crap, she is just pointing out what's out there.  Regards, Tom Savage

I just wonder if it isn't too easy to condemn Imus as a way of sublimating
our own racism, potential and/or actual? How many of us haven't made
racist comments about one or another group, including our own? I agree
with the punishment but he's also being made the scapegoat for a LOT of
behavior that doesn't get talked about, ever, and this situation isn't
going to change that.

Let I. be "punished" but let's also look at ourselves.

The list potentially goes on-and-on, depending upon what you mean by
'visionary'.  (What do you mean by that?)

Without being nasty about it, which writers would you include on a
counter-list of 'non-visionary' poetics & poetry?

Fair enough, Alan--of course, the ruling media elites (who come on
Imus' show year after hear, thereby implicitly signing off on his
comments) aren't just "us"--they're power brokers, and an attack on
them should be considered part of an effort at political reform:
this isn't ultimately about scapegoating at all, I don't think.....

Of all the disgusting things Imus seems to be saying on the radio over the
years, why is this one picked up, "nappy-headed hos"? To call Highfill a
cleaning woman or referring to the tattoos of Rutgers basketball players as
opposed to the pretty chicks of the other team (a complex set of slurs which
involves both gay bashing, dykes, and sexual/racial stereotyping, Georgia
peach feminine as opposed to tattoo wearing blacks) seems much more vile and
profound to me.

Is it because the proverbial last drop or the straw breaking the camel's
back is reached. I doubt it. The fact is that if the objection had been
around the cleaning woman reference or even the dyke joke the uproar would
not have reached, I think, the intensity it has.Gay bashing jokes are too
"main-stream," so to speak. Many people still believe any black in a
position of power has reached that position because of special
dispensations.

The "nappy headed hos," unfortunately for Imus, was a perfect storm because
everybody could find an "outsider" target they could jointly attack, "rap
music" (with the exception of some people here on the list). Though I feel
mixed about the Imus situation (basically I think there are too many taboos
in our culture now, but if the jokes were about Jews I would have been first
asking for his removal), the scapegoat is not Imus, who is basically getting
what was coming to him, but rap music. Ironically, it is an easier target.

I am personaly amazed that so many companies have withdrawn their
advertizements from Imus's show. Perhaps,there is now a truly powerful
constituency in our culture against such shameless racism.

Ciao,

Murat

By visionary I mean visions (as I understood the original post).
Wasn't considering "visionary" to mean innovative. And, by
visions, I mean corporeal, imaginative, and intellectual. Shelley, Keats,
Goethe (to some extent), Novalis, Poe, H. D., Duncan, Merrill, etc.,
claimed to have corporeal visions--with which may have been coupled
locutions and other supernatural maifestations which were, or appeared
to be, perceived by means of the senses--eather as figures really present
externally stiking the retina or other organ of sense, there determining the
physical phenomena of their visions: or else (they reported) agents
superior to them directly modified their eye, or othe sensual organ, so
as to produce a sensation equivalent to that which an external object
would produce.

Many of them also reported imaginative visions in that the sensible
representation of an object by the action of the imagination alone, without
the aid of the eye or other sensual organ. In these visions the poet may
have
been aware that the object apparently seen existed only in her imagination,
or she may have been, so to speak, projecting it without herself, in which
case there was a hallucination. These writers have noted that imaginative
visions usually last for a short time only; because 1. the poet's attempt to
define or fix the elements of the vision by conscious effort tended to wash
it away quickly, or 2. because they were soon enfolded into intellectual
visions--
those in which no sensible image was perceived, but the intelligency was
enlightened directly, without the support  of either images, external or
imagined,
or even of the work of reason.

Specifically, those not being able to be placed by the above descriptions.

Opportunity isn't yet missed...
Obviously, there's a debate amongst blacks about the representative
role of hip hop....

there's the brilliant bell hooks argument (from the early 90s) when
she was asked to criticize the sexism of hip-hop by a white-run
magazine,
and instead talked about the seemingly more 'benign' forms of sexism
in the white media (the movie 'the piano' for instance, she mentioned)

sure, angelou in many ways is saying what imus himself said (in imus'
'apology,' he said he just got those words from hip hop....)
     and eliding the possible difference between what happens when a
black uses a word and a white uses the same word....

but she does raise the question about whether the mostly white-
controlled media's pushing of certain forms of hip hop
that use words that, yes, some blacks find demeaning (whether rightly
or wrongly; i leave that debate for others),
at the expense of other forms of rap/hip hop or even other genres
that black musicians often feel they have to 'go against the grain'
to work in
might itself be a fascist control of the media while pretending to be
freedom
(Oh we're just 'giving the people what they want,' 'letting boys be
boys" etc....)

Angelou's statement may be short on deep social analysis here (in
contrast to bell hooks and others), but it is a valid point,
and I don't think she's arguing for fascism and media control--
in a way, i think her statement can be read as arguing for less of it
(if you accept the argument that there was a white sanctioned 'bling'
conspiracy that forced a lot of the most progressive rap
off the mainstream commercial airwaves in the last ten or so years....

(on another point---and it's not really an argument, or defense of
imus, but i'm not so sure that really is the way he really talks;
   it may not have been intended to 'shock' per se, but like so many
whites attempting to appropriate black slang to give them some kind of
    'edge' and not really getting it....not that i do either....
              I'm hearing a lot of blacks speak up about this, and
that to me is a good thing, especially as it moves into these larger
issues
               that got shut up after the New Orleans diaspora..

Subject:      Bill Berkson joins Michael Glover and Ernesto Priego at Parasol
              Unit, London
MIME-Version: 1.0

The Parasol Unit poetry series is pleased to announce that a third reader has been added to our previously announced reading on Tuesday, 5 June, at 6:30 PM. In addition to the English poet Michael Glover and the Mexican poet Ernesto Priego, this reading will also feature the distinguished American poet Bill Berkson.

  Bill Berkson, poet, critic, and teacher, was born in New York City in 1939. A longtime resident of California, he has for many years taught at the San Francisco Art Institute. He is the author of sixteen books and pamplets of poetry, most recently Our Friends Will Pass Silently Among You (The Owl Press, 2007) and Gloria (Arion Press, 2005, with etchings by Alex Katz). Other recent books include Sudden Address: Selected Lectures 1981-2006 (Cuneiform Press, 2007), What’s Your Idea of a Good Time: Letters & Interviews 1977-1985 with Bernadette Mayer (Tuumba Press, 2006), and The Sweet Singer of Modernism & Other Art Writings (Qua Books, 2004). As Ron Padgett says: "Bill Berkson's writing is witty, musical, daily, and deep, underpinned by a bracing integrity and shot through with gorgeous abstraction and other brilliant hookups between eye, ear, mind, and heart."

    Michael Glover has written art criticism for The Times, The Economist, The Independent, and The Financial Times, among others. He is the author of several books and chapbooks of poetry, including Amidst All This Debris (2001) and The Bead-Eyed Man (2000), both from Dagger Press, and Impossible Horizons (Sinclair-Stevenson, 1995). Of his new book, For the Sheer Hell of Living, to be published this year by San Marco Press, John Ashbery writes, "Michael Glover’s lines unspool gravely and efficiently with few commas like waves that know they are on the way to someplace but without making much fuss about it. They can be piercingly sad and hilariously wry, sometimes at the same time, as: ‘Someone loses the midge swat./ Many glasses are raised.’—this from a poem called ‘Few things happen.’ Few things happen here, true, but those that do are tremendously important even when tiny."

  Ernesto Priego is a Mexican poet, essayist, and translator presently living in London. He is the author of Not Even Dogs (Meritage Press, 2006) as well as the blogs "Never Neutral" (http://neverneutral.wordpress.com/) and "The Jainakú Project"  (http://thejainakuproject.blogspot.com/). A recent interview with him can be found on Tom Beckett’s blog "e-x-c-h-a-n-g-e-v-a-l-u-e -s" (willtoexchange.blogspot.com).




    The readings at Parasol Unit are organized and introduced by Barry Schwabsky. Previous readers have been Tim Atkins, Guy Bennett, Peter Cole, Kelvin Corcoran, Linh Dinh, Carrie Etter, Allen Fisher, Mark Ford, Lee Harwood, Lyn Hejinian, Sue Hubbard, Vincent Katz, Tony Lopez, Drew Milne, Redell Olsen, Anthony Rudolf, Leslie Scalapino, Barry Schwabsky, John Seed, Simon Smith, Carol Szymanski, Catherine Wagner, and Barrett Watten.

  Readings begin at 6:30 PM and are free to the public. Parasol Unit is located at 14 Wharf Road, London N1, near the Old Street and Angel tube stations.

OH MAN, where to begin!?

I can't believe yet another poet,
this time one on this List is going
to THROW rap and Hip Hop into
one chuck bucket!  Oh brother, I
can't believe it!  What's with this
weird want for control?  First of all
you can't say ALL rap and Hip Hop
fall into the "scary" category, GEESH!
Not only that, but IS IT POSSIBLE
you actually believe RAP AND HIP
HOP are the problem and NOT poverty
and a host of other issues at hand?
Silencing human beings who are
presenting their message is about
YOU, is for YOU, and not helping
EITHER them or YOU in the long run.

Listen, I'm a faggot who has been
abused verbally and physically over
the years for being a faggot and I'm
STILL SAYING we need a better
solution than sending the bigots
underground.  Seriously, just hear
me out for a sec here.  Shipping
Imus down the river (no pun intended)
is no victory for anyone.  Spreading
the fear of expressing HONEST
FEELINGS is the worst possible thing,
that's my whole point.  The Imus
fan base is not going to suddenly
catch of whiff of some kind of enlightened
readjustment!  They're going to slip further
into their tangle of feeling abandoned, or
whatever the fuck they're feeling.

Racism, homophobia, sexism, it's all
born out of a deep fear, primal fear of
scarcity of things and security and
love and who the fuck knows what else!
But clearly bigotry is sick, it's an illness,
it's the brain and heart LITERALLY acting
out of proportion to reality!  But while AN
OUTRIGHT PUSH to get folks to be open
and honest is always at hand, we let it go.
Firing Imus the prime example today.
How much more progress COULD HAVE
BEEN MADE if we had had the opportunity
to dialogue with him?  But instead we're left
with this same old two-sided argument that
pushes the fear into hiding, merely creating
more fear in the end.

Let me tell you something, I may
not be black, but I KNOW WHEN
someone is homophobic and hiding it!
And I bet you people of color know when
someone's racist in a very similar way.

And Chris, yeah man I know what you're
saying that there's dialogue going on all
over the place, but I'm talking about THIS
SUDDENLY HUGE Imus issue getting lost.
Everyone puckered up and kissed the asses
that needed kissing and got on their way with things.

And the CEOs of these corporations
pulling their ads are the worst contributors
of sexism and racism and poverty and
murder and war and let's keep going
because the list is mighty long!  These
corporations in question for NBC are
conglomerates OWNING the very news
stations OWNING weapons manufacturing
plants while also selling gum drops and
tricycles.  In other words it's SO LAUGHABLE
that corporations are actually trying to use this
situation to look good.  They couldn't wash
the blood off their hands with Imus's spit if
they wrung that man out for every drop of
pit stored in his glands!

Dear All,

Listenlight is seeking visual and textual work for the upcoming issue 09
(first beta published <http://listenlight.net/09/beta00.php>, come
see).  Again, it seems our "male" design patterns aren't warming to many
women, so, women are especially encouraged to send in.  In fact, we will
prefer to receive work only by women at this point.  And let me know if
you want to design the next issue.

Best,

I just find it hard to believe that Imus picked up the first comment "vaudville hoes" from rap. Vaudville hoes? that is indicative of something much deeper than common rap music. It is black face and the whole history brought out. The full on contra-indicative problem flowing straighout forth, full fathom five. I just don't buy the excuse being sold.

The time before last that I saw Kurt Vonnegut he was smoking a lucky strike
  and asked me if I was a writer and I said
  "that is what they brought me in for" and he said "me too"
  and we sat there watching all of the traffic go by.

Totally agree here. Imus is too into kickin' back
with old school country. He might listen to Ray
Charles, but only in duet with Willy Nelson.
Or if he listens to or hosts Sam Moore, it's simply
cause it was the music of his life back when he
was scoring 8-balls and being a human for vodka.

Problem here is (and it's the same one we have with
our current president) we are dealing with brains that
have been dmaged by years of alcohol, drugs, you
name it. Instead of trying to repair these people we
foist them into the limelight... into the White House.

Sad thing is: Imus seems (admittedly so) to have
replaced his chemical addictions with his addictions
to work...and power... (or the illusion of the latter,
since this week he learned that he too works for Pharoh.)

Yes, the only rap he's ever heard is the rap he may
have overheard while passing his engineer's little hole
in the station.

When scraps and snippets and swatches of language are stitched

Here's the poem he delivered at my
commencement several centuries ago:

Hey, Sonia,
Please meet me in Fredonia.
I'll give you a begonia.
What do you say?
Won't ya?

Afterwards a group of about seven of us
took him up the road to see Twain's house.
And I told him that the funeral parlor the next
house up was a stop on the underground railroad
during the time M. T. was there. And he
wondered aloud "about how many of the
good people of Hadleyburg* were corrupted
by that knowledge."

* Hadleyburg is generally considered to be
modeled after Fredonia, New York.

Please forgive me, I made a mistake.
  It was, of course, a Pall Mall.

From: Walter Lew <lew7828@bellsouth.net>
Subject: Walter K. Lew Lecture Friday and Reading Saturday in Minneapolis
To: POETICS@LISTSERV.BUFFALO.EDU

For those of you in the Twin Cities area, a last-minute notice of a
talk and reading I'm giving:

"Meaning's Many-Patterned Movement:
What the Long History of Korean Intermedia Texts Can Offer Us as New Artists"

Korean studies scholar and poet Walter K. Lew will present different
examples from the long history of Korean texts that combine language,
icons and other imagery, and sometimes performance. These range from
7th-century Buddhist dharani and the 15th-century development of a
new Korean orthography (actually, "orthophony") to multimedia
performances during the Japanese colonial era and the avant-garde
poetries of Yi Sang (1910-1937) and Yi Won (b. 1968). Time
permitting, he will suggest ways in which they can serve as models
for new work in the present. Lew teaches in the English Dept. of the
U. of Miami in Coral Gables, FL.

WHEN:
Friday. April 13 at 3 p.m.

WHERE:
Minnesota Population Center Seminar room
Lower Level, 50 Willey Hall
University of Minnesota, West Bank

CONTACT:
Karen Kinoshita
University of Minnesota

SPONSORS:

Lew will also give a brief reading the following evening, Sat., April
14, as part of the opening ceremony for an exhibit on the Korean War
titled "Still Present Pasts" at Intermedia Arts in Minneapolis (2822
Lyndale Avenue South / phone: 612.871.4444).

Against a backdrop of the presentation of quite innovative artists,
filmmakers, & musicians as well as critical coverage thereof, the National
Gallery of Art embarrasses itself by offering up this series of lit-crit
lectures which doesn't even hint at treatment of the fine arts in its
attempt to polish the tombs of a dead New England lineage.  Whether
individuals in the audience will challenge Vendler's "taste" remains to be
seen.   Barry Alpert

Subject:      HCE anthology--a note about permissions
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

In L.A. this week, at the great art & arch bookstore, Hennessy and Ingalls, I bought a book called PERMISSIONS: A Survival Guide--Blunt Talk about Art as Intellectual Property, by Susan Bielstein, an editor at University of Chicago Press. Though she focuses on visual art, her discussion of copyright, fair use, and print and digital rights all made me think of the list discussion about the HCE anthology.

I haven't finished the book yet but can recommend it just on the strength of the sample legal forms and contractual language she offers in the appendix.

I'm very interested in the subject on practical and theoretical levels and I appreciate Bielstein's approach to artists' "moral rights." Her captions for the illustrations in the book include notes about costs, permissions received, etc. Francis Bacon's estate wouldn't let her use one of his paintings so she has a blank page with a brief caption about her futile attempt to get permission.

If you haven't come across the greatest 19th century--and perhaps 20th
and 21st century--experimental poet of the South, it's high time you
learned of Thomas Holley Chivers, author of Eonchs of Ruby, Virginalia,
and other attempts at capturing the speech of Angels.  The title of this
posting is something that Swinburne is alleged to have said to a
visiting poet.  Yes Chivers is yet another of the sublime absurdists.
May he live forever in the Swedenborgian outback of American letters!

What's your problem? Live and let live. Nothing forces you to read Robert Lowell or listen to Helen Vendler's lecture.

"Dr. Barry S. Alpert" <vanguardphenomena@HOTMAIL.COM> wrote:  Against a backdrop of the presentation of quite innovative artists,
filmmakers, & musicians as well as critical coverage thereof, the National
Gallery of Art embarrasses itself by offering up this series of lit-crit
lectures which doesn't even hint at treatment of the fine arts in its
attempt to polish the tombs of a dead New England lineage. Whether
individuals in the audience will challenge Vendler's "taste" remains to be
seen. Barry Alpert

Lee Stringer, Felicia Luna Lemus & Joseph Coulson
Sunday, April 15th @ 5 p.m. FREE
Gathering of the Tribes
285 East Third Street (btw Ave. C & D)
New York, NY
www.tribes.org for venue info
Reading is hosted by Akashic Books, Archipelago Books & Seven Stories
Press


JOSEPH COULSON is the author of Of Song and Water (Archipelago Books,
2007) and The Vanishing Moon (Archipelago, 2004, Harcourt paperback
2005) which was selected for the Barnes & Noble Great New Writers
series.

"Love abandoned, violence sustained, guilt, grief, the transcendence of
sailing and making music, all play in jazzlike counterpoint. Coulson's
rhapsodic novel progresses from harsh equations of black and white to
an exaltation of color." —Donna Seaman, Booklist

“The jazz scenes crackle with energy and authority... the novel is
ultimately quiet, affecting and redemptive.”  —Publishers Weekly

LEE STRINGER is the author of the acclaimed Grand Central Winter:
Stories from the Street (Seven Stories Press, 1998), which chronicled
his twelve years of homelessness in New York City. Grand Central Winter
has been translated into eighteen languages and was both a New York
Times Notable Book and one of the Top Ten Recommended Titles of the
year in USA Today. Stringer is also the author of Sleepaway School:
Stories from a Boy’s Life (Seven Stories Press, 2004) and Like Shaking
Hands with God: A Conversation on Writing (1999), written with Kurt
Vonnegut. He lives in Mamaroneck, New York, where he grew up.

“In Sleepaway School, a boy becomes a man. The way Lee Stringer tells
it, that is by itself more than enough for an enthralling story. Never
mind which boy, never mind the milieu, although the boy and the milieu
can in their own right be called really something.”  —Kurt Vonnegut,
from the Foreword


FELICIA LUNA LEMUS is the author of the novel Like Son (Akashic Books,
2007) and Trace Elements of Random Tea Parties (Farrar, Straus and
Giroux, 2003). She teaches writing at The New School and lives in the
East Village of Manhattan.

"Felicia Luna Lemus's fresh yet plain-spoken prose roots us in today's
sad and sweeping chaos, as hope, love, and wild myth propel her unique
characters into an unknown future. Like Son is a sweet song of a
story." —Michelle Tea, author of Rose of No Man's Land

"Like Son moves on the wings of a soulful, visceral kind of androgeny.
Old men, young men, hot girls—all step forward and sing from their
stuttering hearts. Like Son is one terrific read." —Eileen Myles,
author of Cool for You

blocks

set of late 19th cent early 20th cent children's blocks.
rearranged i desperately tried to fill in the gaps.
closed in one area and expanded in another,
just like the true-real, nothing fits any more.
the gaps are small, hiatus, liminal, interval.
they tend towards closure, implying they didn't mean it,
they meant nothing by it, it was an accident,
it was nothing at all. teeth are always on the edge
of things, and that's where the world forms and tears
apart. later, azure appeared and set everything aright.
it took her a few minutes. she followed the diagrams.

Poetics Listers in the Los Angeles area might be interested in a
theatrical production of Edgar Allan Poe's "Masque of the Red Death"
at Zombie Joe's Underground Theatre in the NoHo arts district. It
runs Friday and Saturday through April 28th, at 8:30. I've written
the music and songs for the show.

We use every word of Poe's text, which often reads more like poetry
than prose. The staging is masque- like -- a revel in which the
audience can sit, stand, or move around the playing area.

Reviews?  How about this . . .

"This macabre in-the-round reading of Poe's plague-ridden classic
typifies the company's skill at interpretive mayhem. Poe would surely
approve" -- Los Angeles Times ("Recommended")

"The troupe acts as an eight-headed monster, often crammed together
in a writhing, groping, orgiastic mass. The players deliver their
successive lines with the assuredness and timing of the Beastie
Boys.  Never were they more horrifying than when marching in a dance
line directly toward this reviewer, who soon thereafter found a safer
seat off to the side." -- LA Weekly ("GO")

The show lasts about an hour and costs $12.  There's plenty of free
parking.

This staging requires that tickets for each performance are very
limited, so reserve early.

MERITAGE PRESS ANNOUNCEMENT

A Two-Volume Poetry Collection by Allen Bramhall:

DAYS POEM, Vol. I
494 pages
ISBN: 978-0-9709-1798-0
Price: $28.00

DAYS POEM, Vol. II
441 pages
ISBN: 978-0-9709-1799-7

Meritage Press (www.meritagepress.com) is delighted to announce a
PRE-RELEASE SPECIAL OFFER for a unique and ambitious two-volume
collection by Allen Bramhall: DAYS POEM.  Mr. Bramhall describes his
project with:

"Begun casually, the writing of Days Poem quickly grew into a daily
necessity to write, even to plug onward. In this way, it resembles a
journal or novel, tho it claims neither genre as its own. It started
with an idea of writing large and embracing extent. It settled (and
unsettled) itself within the compelling philosophical argument that it
is what it is. The thrill of relentlessness and perseverance pushed it
until, you know, it came to an end. As the writer of these pages, I
wanted to play with hobos, and bears, and Tarzan & Jane, and Walden
Pond, and all the words in between. I wanted a little amazement in every
day."


BIO: Allen Bramhall was born by the banks of the Concord River in 1952
and has lived in Massachusetts ever since. He was educated at Franconia
College and Lesley University, and in non-academic places as well. /
Simple Theory / (Potes & Poets Press) was his first book. He maintains a
blog called Tributary, and a life with Beth and Erin.

To celebrate the release of Days Poem, Meritage Press is pleased to
offer the following PRE-RELEASE OFFER:

To order a single volume, a 20% discount and free shipping/handling
(about a $3.00 value) for a single-volume price of $22.40

To order both volumes, a 25% discount and free shipping handling for a
2-volume price of $42.00

This offer will be good through May 31, 2007...and is expected to be the
least expensive rate for purchasing the book(s).  Please send checks
made out to "Meritage Press" and mail to

Eileen Tabios
Meritage Press
256 North Fork Crystal Springs Rd.
St. Helena, CA 94574

What does the word "Agno" translate into?  Assuming it's latin, not
in my dictionaries.





For there is a language of flowers.

For there is a sound reasoning upon all flowers.

For elegant phrases are nothing but flowers.

Currently leading a workshop where folks wake up wanting to liberate their
dreams into poems.
Will appreciate anyone's suggestions or directions to any writing on
interesting ways to jump beyond the journal "reportage" hurdle.

Front or back channel, whatever works.

Thanks so much,

Elizabeth Bishop in Brazil. Lecture by Paulo Henriques
Britto

Elizabeth Bishop lived in Brazil more or less
continuously from 1951 to 1966 and then intermittently
to 1971. The country functioned as a necessary escape
from the deprived and anxious world of her early
childhood. Creative Writing Brazil will have a
discussion about Bishop's life and work in Brazil. We
can also assist you with your travel plans to visit
Elizabeth Bishop's house in Ouro Preto and other noted
Bishop landmarks in Brazil. Also, introduce you to
renowned Bishop scholars and translators of her work.
Paulo Henriques Britto was born in Rio de Janeiro in
1951. His third collection of poems, Trovar Claro,
received Brazil's equivalent of the National Book
Award from the Biblioteca Nacional, and his fourth
book, Macau, won Brazil's most prestigious award, the
Portugal Telecom Prize. In 2005, he published his
first short story collection, Paraisos artificiais.
Britto is also one of Brazil's principle translators
of British and American literature, and received the
National Library Foundation's prize for his 1995
translation of E. L. Doctorow's The Waterworks. His
other translations include works by Henry James, V. S.
Naipaul, Thomas Pynchon, Wallace Stevens, and
Elizabeth Bishop's poems about Brazil. He currently
teaches at the Catholic University of Rio de Janeiro.

----
Translation Workshop

Translation class on Brazilian poets Carlos Drummond
de Andrade and Joao Cabral de Melo Neto lead by Flavia
Rocha. Flavia Rocha is a Brazilian poet, journalist
and translator living in Brazil. In Sao Paulo, she
worked as a staff reporter for magazines Casa Vogue,
Carta Capital, Republica, Valor Economico and Bravo!.
She has an M.F.A program in Writing at Columbia
University and is the editor of Rattapallax magazine.
Her first collection of poetry, The Blue House Around
Noon was released by Travessa dos Editores in 2004.
Her translations of contemporary American and
Brazilian poets have appeared in The Chattahoochee
Review, Callaloo, Rattapallax, and Poetry Wales.

-----
Tour of Sao Paulo & Salon Reading

Throughout the week, everyone will be having casual
get togethers with leading Brazilian poets, editors,
writers, and publishers. An important aspect of the
workshop is an interaction between participants and
their contemporary counterparts in Brazil. You will
visit important cultural sites, bookstores, and
literary landmarks. All participants will have an
opportunity to read at the Salons in Sao Paulo and New
York City. Also, Rattapallax magazine will assist with
the publication of the work produced during the
workshops in literary and online journals.

Actually, it's Greek.  The 'A' translates to 'not,' and the 'gno' is the
root of the Greek word, 'gnossis,' or spiritual knowledge.

The closest I can come in my Greek dictionary is spelled "alpha, gamma,
omnicron, omega," and means "I ignore" or "I am ignorant of."

After posting this earlier, I thought to adapt it for an imaginary
audience of college freshmen in a first composition and literature
course.  Something like this, while admittingly somewhat idiosyncratic,
might have helped me a lot at that time.  If you like it, you're welcome
to distribute it freely --- especially to college freshmen.





Unintentional essay on literature and music



i.

Music is the best case to compare modes of popularity within the arts.
Compare a band like The Beatles to Ernest Hemingway. Hemingway will
reach farther into the future, but doesn't reach as much of the now as
The Beatles, who in turn reach less of the real. (Only reality can grasp
time (because nothing else is just as unending as time)). In popular
music, six months after the singles aren't in quadruple-daily rotation,
they strain to elicit feelings beyond nostalgia. Yet we can read and
read again a great novel or poetry without feeling nostalgia per se. In
literature the goal is more a reigning in of time, where in music it is
meant to inflate a particular time. We don't return to a work of
literature to re-live our first encounter with it, but out of wonderment
or concern over how it will "speak" (reflect) into our present and
present-future circumstances. Honestly, our circumstances predicate our
"worldview" (by which one might have objected to the former statement).
So it isn't nostalgia which clears the way to a great literary work.
It's vanity.



ii.

After thinking more about the impulses that lead us back to favorite
music and books, it seems that the literary impulse is comparably more
vain than the musical. This is still inchoate, but you will agree that
literature as almost nothing else helps us check our vanities. It might
be said to be the function of literature. So, a good work thereof must
have at ready disposal a considerable nuance of vanity, make a deft
flourish thereby, then proceed with our attention into its moral and
aesthetic content. So, it can be said that it's not vanity which brings
us to literature, but the want of ridding vanity. Is there a precise
word for this feeling? I don't think so.

There are great distinctions to make between modes of delivery within
the realm of the written word. It's my opinion that poetry, intrinsic of
its most immediate recognizance, works to empty us of vanity (or pity
and fear, adapted from Aristotelian vocabulary), that poetry works to
empty us of this at an earliest juncture and then replace it with
something else, something useful in our business of widening our
emotional and social balance. Fiction (more to the point, the novel)
develops a climactic arc of filling us first with this stuff before
working to purge it later on, which is the narrative mode, applicable to
all tragedy, comedy, absurdity.

Poetry is more challenging for its attenuated narrative. It works to
reverse engineer a vanity, let's say, so that later on (often much
later, so it will not have seemed to be an effect of the poem) the
vanity appears and is recognized at once, in what we might call an
epiphany. Narrative does not seek such lofty fame. And anything that
makes us feel more balanced and whole, or alive to the world, has some
actual poetry to it.



iii.

The other day I was listening to some music that had been of much
interest to me several months ago on first hearing it. I caught myself
in a strange loop. I felt now that my first experience to the music had
been during a better time, maybe idyllic, and not that of the same
petulant torpor. I laughed. Nostalgia was telling me too soon that I am
happy and warm on any angle approaching this music. It comes from a word
meaning "a return home," and it's more than pressing to find a negative
thought in us for nostalgia, besides a removed fear for talking too
loudly of it in public, "I won't be the nostalgic." But it's the first
feeling we crave when we are alone. Nostalgia is so accommodating to our
desires that it easily mixes with any other feeling, without complaint
or prejudice, for any circumstance. It is probably why babies know how
to cry.

Unintentional essay on literature and music


i.

Music is the best case to compare modes of popularity within the arts.
Compare a band like The Beatles to Ernest Hemingway. Hemingway will
reach farther into the future, but doesn't reach as much of the now as
The Beatles, who in turn reach less of the real. (Only reality can grasp
time (because nothing else is just as ugly as time)). In popular music,
six months after the singles aren't in quadruple-daily rotation, they
strain to elicit feelings beyond nostalgia. Yet we can read and read
again a great novel or poetry without feeling nostalgia per se. In
literature the goal is more a reigning in of time, rather than in music
which means to inflate a particular time. We don't return to a work of
literature to re-live our first encounter with it, but out of wonderment
or concern over how it will "speak" (reflect) into our present and
present-future circumstances. Honestly, our circumstances predicate our
"worldview" (by which one might have objected to the former statement).
So it isn't nostalgia which leads us back to a great literary work. It's
vanity. Huh? Have we uncovered a secret between the popular and elite arts?



ii.

After thinking more about the impulses that lead us back to favorite
music and books, it seems that the literary impulse is comparably more
vain than the musical. This is still inchoate, but you will agree that
literature as almost nothing else helps us check our vanities. It might
be said to be the function of literature. So, a good work thereof must
have at ready disposal a considerable nuance of vanity, make a deft
flourish thereby, then proceed with our attention into its moral and
aesthetic content. So, it can be said that it's not vanity which brings
us to literature, but the want of ridding vanity. Is there a precise
word for this feeling? I don't think so.

There are great distinctions to make between modes of delivery within
the realm of the written word. It's my opinion that poetry, intrinsic of
its most immediate recognizance, works to empty us of vanity (or pity
and fear, adapted from the Aristotelian vocabulary), that poetry works
to empty us of this at an earliest juncture and then replace it with
something else, something useful in our business of widening our
emotional and social balance. Fiction (more to the point, the novel)
develops a climactic arc of filling us first with this stuff before
working to purge it later on, which is the narrative mode, applicable to
all tragedy, comedy, absurdity.

Poetry is more challenging for its attenuated narrative. It works to
reverse engineer a vanity, let's say, so that later on (often much
later, so it will not have seemed to be an effect of the poem) the
vanity appears and is recognized at once, in what we might call an
epiphany. Narrative does not seek such lofty fame. And anything that
makes us feel more balanced and whole, or alive to the world, has some
actual poetry to it.



iii.

The other day I was listening to some music that had been of much
interest to me several months ago on first hearing it. I caught myself
in a strange loop. I felt now that my first experience to the music had
been during a better time, maybe idyllic, and not that of the same
petulant torpor. I laughed. Nostalgia was telling me too soon that I was
happy and warm on any angle approaching this music. It comes from a word
meaning "a return home," and it's more than pressing to find a negative
thought in us for nostalgia, besides a removed fear for talking too
loudly of it in public, "I won't be the nostalgic." But it's the first
feeling we crave when we are alone. Nostalgia is so accommodating to our
desires that it's easily mixed with any other feeling, without complaint
or prejudice. And it's probably why babies know how to cry.

  (CNN) -- A lone gunman is dead after police said he killed at least 21 people Monday during twin shootings on the Virginia Tech campus -- the worst school shooting incident in U.S. history.
  "Some victims were shot in a classroom," university police Chief Wendell Flinchum said during a news conference in Blacksburg.
  Police believe there was only one gunman, Flinchum said.
  "Today the university was struck with a tragedy that we consider of monumental proportions," said university President Charles Steger. "The university is shocked and indeed horrified." (Map of Blacksburg)
  The shootings mark the deadliest school shooting incident in U.S. history, topping attacks at Columbine High School in 1999 and at the University of Texas in 1966.
  The Associated Press quoted officials saying more than 20 people were wounded. A hospital spokeswoman told AP that 17 Virginia Tech students were being treated for gunshot wounds and other injuries.
  Sharon Honaker at the Carilion New River Valley Medical Center in nearby Christiansburg, Virginia, told CNN that four patients had been transported there, one in critical condition.
  One person was killed and others were wounded at multiple locations inside a dormitory about 7:15 a.m., Flinchum said. Two hours later, another shooting at Norris Hall, the engineering science and mechanics building, resulted in multiple casualties, the university reported. (Campus map)
  The first reported shooting occurred at West Ambler Johnston Hall, a four-story coed dormitory that houses 895 students. The dormitory, one of the largest residence halls on the 2,600-acre campus, is located near the drill field and stadium.
  Amie Steele, editor-in-chief of the campus newspaper, said one of her reporters at the dormitory reported "mass chaos."
  The reporter said there were "lots of students running around, going crazy, and the police officers were trying to settle everyone down and keep everything under control," according to Steele. (Watch police, ambulances hustle to the scene )
  Kristyn Heiser said she was in class about 9:30 a.m. when she and her classmates saw about six gun-wielding police officers run by a window.
  "We were like, 'What's going on?' Because this definitely is a quaint town where stuff doesn't really happen. It's pretty boring here," said Heiser during a phone interview as she sat on her classroom floor.
  Student reports 'mayhem'  Student Matt Waldron said he did not hear the gunshots because he was listening to music, but he heard police sirens and saw officers hiding behind trees with their guns drawn.
  "They told us to get out of there so we ran across the drill field as quick as we could," he said.
  Waldron described the scene on campus as "mayhem." (Watch a student's recording of police responding to loud bangs
  "It was kind of scary," he said. "These two kids I guess had panicked and jumped out of the top-story window and the one kid broke his ankle and the other girl was not in good shape just lying on the ground."
  Madison Van Duyne said she and her classmates in a media writing class were on "lockdown" in their classrooms. They were huddled in the middle of the classroom, writing stories about the shootings and posting them online.
  The university is updating its more than 26,000 students through e-mails, and an Internet webcam is broadcasting live pictures of the campus.
  The shootings came three days after a bomb threat Friday forced the cancellation of classes in three buildings, WDBJ in Roanoke reported. Also, the 100,000-square-foot Torgersen Hall was evacuated April 2 after police received a written bomb threat, The Roanoke Times reported.
  Last August, the first day of classes was cut short by a manhunt after an escaped prisoner was accused of killing a security guard at a Blacksburg hospital and a sheriff's deputy.
  After the Monday shootings, students were instructed to stay indoors and away from windows, police at the university said. (Watch the police chief explain where bodies were found )
  "Virginia Tech has canceled all classes. Those on campus are asked to remain where they are, lock their doors and stay away from windows. Persons off campus are asked not to come to campus," a statement on the university Web site said.
  Before Monday, the deadliest school shootings came in 1966 and 1999.
  In the former, Charles Joseph Whitman, a 25-year-old ex-Marine, killed 13 people on the University of Texas campus. He was killed by police.
  In 1999, 17-year-old Dylan Klebold and 18-year-old Eric Harris -- armed with guns and pipe bombs -- killed 12 students and a teacher before killing themselves.

Hi, Stephen,

Since you asked...
Photographer Rusty Crump & I have just had a book of photos (his & mine) &
my tiny synasthetic dream prose poems come out as a free e-book & a POD book
at blazevox.org. Rusty superimposed some of my words on his photos & one of
the points of the book is show some relationship btwn the waking life & the
dream life. It's called Morphology for the way organism grow & change, and
words do, so there is that parallel. And I've kept in only the synasthetic
moments or those close to synasthetic, often cutting the dream down from a
page to a sentence.

Be interested to hear how that goes.

Best,

Ruth Lepson

A quick message to mention that I've got some work in a new anthology of baseball haiku just published in hardback by W. W. Norton. Baseball Haiku (http://www.amazon.com/Baseball-Haiku-Cor-van-Heuvel/dp/0393062198), edited by Cor van den Heuvel and Nanae Tamura, contains Japanese and North American haiku about baseball, including the earliest known haiku about baseball, by Shiki (one of Japan's four great haiku masters), plus haiku by other poets such as Jack Kerouac.

Cor van den Heuvel was interviewed about the book on NPR recently, too (the interview is available at http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=9264826 -- click Listen at the top of the page).

Earlier today I was talking about how lovely it is to work at a =
university.
How civilized and welcoming. Etc. I still believe it is, especially =
compared
to places I've worked before. This is terrible news, but a measure of =
the
sense of community for those who work at a university is the shock they =
feel
with confronted with something like this.

Hi Stephen--

Might be interesting to have them read Rumi or Hafez, though I would
recommend neither Coleman Barks nor Daniel Ladinsky. Here's a link to some
new translations of Rumi that I think are really beautiful:

Richard,

Thank you for the pointer to the new translations of Rumi. Particularly the
gazel translations are wonderful.

Ciao,

Thank you, Skip.  It is strange, esp since it really is unrelated to my life, save the fact that it reminds of one's own tenuousness ...

Moreover, since I am not a mother (and am often reduced to a ticked-off instructor in the face of seeming apathy or resistance), I can only imagine the sorrow some parents are feeling for their children, just becoming adults, tonight.

sense of community for those who work at a university is the shock they feel
with confronted with something like this.

If I can be a little self-promoting: On this page on my
website--http://www.richardjnewman.com/publications/bustan.htm--is a
substantial excerpt from the introduction to my translation of selections
from Saadi's Bustan. (Saadi was a contemporary of Rumi and was, in Iran at
least, and by some still is placed higher in the Persian literary canon than
Rumi.) The introduction takes on Barks' and Ladinsky's translations of Rumi
and Hafez respectively in a highly critical way that people on this list
might find interesting. Murat also wrote a review of one of Ladinsky's books
that is well worth reading, though I cannot now lay my hands on the link.
Murat, maybe you can post it?

dear listers,

from the AP:

"Ornette Coleman won the Pulitzer Prize for music on Monday for his
2006 album, 'Sound Grammar,' the second jazz artist to receive the
honor."
http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2007/04/16/america/NA-GEN-US-Pulitzers-Arts-Coleman.php

a small sign that something is right with the world. surprising? well,
it's one of those things, i think, kind of like when robert duncan won
big awards for poetry in 1978 -- major artist releases first new work
in ten years -- in duncan's case, the groundwork poem. and likewise as
duncan's work had circulated privately and in limited editions, so
coleman had been touring with his two-bass quartet for a number of
year. so anyone who was listening knew this was great music, tho i had
no idea there was a CD in the works until it was released. and it as i
wrote a while back, it is a pretty special recording.

what's more shocking is that coleman is only the second-ever jazz
musician to win the pulitzer, and when wynton marsalis won it in 1997
it was for his three-hour oratorio on slavery. so this is the first
time it's ever been won for a jazz work since it was first awarded in
1943!

congrats, mr. coleman!

Surely there is room for all sorts of translations, adaptations, versions, and for all I know channelings of classic texts--that is part of their vitality. I read Barks' Rumi -- striking, well-turned new-agey lyric poems. It was clear enough that these were probably none too faithful, and there was no way to gather from Barks any sense of the formal character of the original (let alone the cultural context that you emphasize in your essay, Richard). The translated poem can't usually do this very well, of course, but it's helpful if the translator writes thoughtfully about the matter, explaining how they attempted to handle the particular linguistic challenges offered by the text. Since I wanted to get a better idea of this than Barks could offer, I naively bought a translation of Rumi published in the Oxford World Authors series -- imagining that this would surely be a serious scholarly approach to Rumi. Well, what I found there would be enough to drive anyone right back
 into the arms of Barks! An embarrassing rendering into jangly rhymed couplets, completely unreadable. So my question is: Is there a book out there that gives the anglophone reader access to the poetry of Rumi?

the award to Ornette Coleman and special citation to John Coltrane got me
looking through the Pulitzers, back as far as the early 1970s. The special
citation last year to Thelonius Monk was also a highlight.

but the poetry .  . .

I had to go back quite a few years to find works I thought deserving at
all, and there were some, though rarely the best books of their year. Even
in a string of three good years, 1974-1976, with the winners
	The Dolphin, by Robert Lowell
	Turtle Island, by Gary Snyder
	Self-Portrait in a Convex Mirror, by John Ashbery
(and there's no 3-year run I can find with winners as good as those), yes
even those, I have to say, don't sound like clear choices at all as those
years saw the publication of such works as vol. 3 of The Maximus Poems by
Charles Olson, Edward Dorn's Selected Poems 1956-1974, Ted Berrigan's Back
in Boston, Barbara Guest's Moscow Mansions, The Selected Poems of Frank
O'Hara, Adrienne Rich's Poems: Selected and New, two volumes of Robin
Blaser's Image Nations (although I guess Canada doesn't count for the
Pulitzers), The Maintains by Clark Coolidge, Things Stirring Together and
Far Away by Larry Eigner, and, I imagine, many more books I would consider
better than those three winners, and those three are just a few among
Pulitzer winners that I would even want to read. So why are the Pulitzers
so bad at poetry? Mostly I ignore them and don't care. It would be nice,
though, to have a Linh Dinh or Stacy Doris or Beverly Dahlen or Ron
Silliman (yes, The Age of Huts (compleat) for a Pulitzer!) receive that
attention.

and you can add that there were two "Special Citations" given by the
Pulitzers, one


"to Ray Bradbury for his distinguished, prolific and deeply influential
career as an unmatched author of science fiction and fantasy."

and one

"posthumous special citation to composer John Coltrane for his masterful
improvisation, supreme musicianship and iconic centrality to the history of
jazz."

about time, i'd say, but also just happy to see such recognition.

Thanks, Tom, for posting this- can't believe it didn't make any of
the SF Bay Area papers. Way to go Ornette! His comments in that AP
article are also typically brilliant. He's not kidding about a "sound
grammar", his playing, and harmolodics in general, is probably the
best argument for music as another natural grammar anyone could make.
I'll not use this space to shit-talk Wynton, though I'm putting a
hole in my lip trying to hold back, but there is something telling in
the fact that by the time the Pulitzer gets around to recognizing the
entire art form, so many have passed away that a "young lion" gets
the award for his made-for-critics opus.

Let's see Sonny Rollins, Sam Rivers, Max Roach, Carla Bley, Dave
Holland, Herbie Hancock (who amongst the living am I leaving out- all
apologies) getting theirs quick!

Hi Richard,

The review of The Gift (Ladinsky's translations of Hafiz) is in two places
in the web. The first is the e-zine read me, edited by Nada Gordon and Gary
Sullivan: http://home.jps.net/~nada/hafiz.htm<http://home.jps.net/%7Enada/hafiz.htm>

The other is the blog, Internation Exchange for Poetic Invention:
http://poeticinvention.blogspot.com/
There, clicking on any one of the labels, "Persian Poetry," "Poetics of
Translation," "Translations" "Reviews," will get you to the essay. From what
I understand, a publisher's blog in Germany discussed the review at some
length about a year ago.

Talking about dream poetry, my poem "A 13th Century Dream" is in the e-zine
Cipher Journal. The address is
http://www.cipherjournal.com/html/13th_century_dream.html

This poem several pages long integrates, contains poems from the Turkish
Sufi troubadour poet Yunus Emre, who was a contemporary of Rumi and lived
basically in the same areas in Anatolia. Though contemporaries, Emre's
poetry presents a different kind of Sufism, one more based on weeping and
dissolution of identity, from Rumi's.

Cipher Journal also contains my essay, "Translation: Contemplating against
the Grain," which  discusses Walter's Benjamin and Jack Spicer in relation
to each other.

Ciao,

Murat

transformations.

Subject:      Real Dreams / Real Poems   2nd try!
Mime-version: 1.0
Content-type: text/plain; charset="US-ASCII"
Content-transfer-encoding: 7bit

When I started the dream query, I was and remain looking for interesting
strategies to liberate the dream into poetic form(s).  Somehow the Sufis
came in - as if in a dream - and stole the show!

I want concrete stuff. I have students whose heads are about to explode from
the dreams they carry from the night, or weeks before! I am being asked to
lighten their loads!

So I want to hear from the Doctors of Dream Poems.

I recollect someone or several mention  Bernadette Meyer had some exercises.
(Anybody know those?)
And, for example, here are several possibilities from Charles Bernstein:

 Dream work:  Write down your dreams as the first thing you do every morning
for 30 days.  Apply translation and aleatoric processes to this material.
Double the length of each dream. Weave them together into one poem, adding
or changing or reordering material.  Negate or reverse all statements (I
went down the hill to I went up the hill, I didn't to I did).  Borrow a
friend's dreams and apply these techniques to them.
4. Synchronicity: Write a poem in which all the events occur simultaneously.
But I will appreciate more, if possible, or directions to any, so speak,
manual resources.

Either front or back channel responses will be much appreciated, and thanks
for those who have already responded.

*I apologize for adding to your Inbox, but this is something you should kno=

about. *

* *

*All of us who publish in literary magazines (or read any small magazine)
are affected by the upcoming postal rate change, which will strongly
advantage the largest media corporations at the expense of small media in
all fields, including the arts, political opinion, etc. *

*Freedom of the press belongs to those who own the press, as we have always
known, and the balance between government support of monopoly/oligarchy and
government support of liberty swings back and forth. *

The news media are covering the tragic murders in Virginia this morning, an=
d
as they do an extraordinarily significant story is slipping through the
cracks.

On very rare occasions I send a message to everyone in my email address boo=
k
on an issue that I find of staggering importance and urgency. (My address
book includes pretty much everyone who emails me in one form or another, an=
d
I apologize if you get this message more than once.) This is one of those
times.

There is a major crisis in our media taking place right now; it is getting
almost no attention and unless we act very soon the consequences for our
society could well be disastrous. And it will only take place because it is
being done without any public awareness or participation; it goes directly
against the very foundations of freedom of the press in the entirety of
American history.

The U.S. Post Office is in the process of implementing a radical
reformulation of its rates for magazines, such that smaller periodicals wil=
l
be hit with a much much larger increase than the largest magazines.

Because the Post Office is a monopoly, and because magazines must use it,
the postal rates always have been skewed to make it cheaper for smaller
publications to get launched and to survive. The whole idea has been to use
the postal rates to keep publishing as competitive and wide open as
possible. This bedrock principle was put in place by James Madison and
Thomas Jefferson. They considered it mandatory to create the press system,
the Fourth Estate necessary for self-government.

It was postal policy that converted the free press clause in the First
Amendment from an abstract principle into a living breathing reality for
Americans. And it has served that role throughout our history.


What the Post Office is now proposing goes directly against 215 years of
postal policy. The Post Office is in the process of implementing a radical
reformulation of its mailing rates for magazines. Under the plan, smaller
periodicals will be hit with a much larger increase than the big magazines,
as much as 30 percent. Some of the largest circulation magazines will face
hikes of less than 10 percent.

The new rates, which go into effect on July 15, were developed with no
public involvement or congressional oversight, and the increased costs coul=
d
damage hundreds, even thousands, of smaller publications, possibly putting
many out of business. This includes nearly every political journal in the
nation. These are the magazines that often provide the most original
journalism and analysis. These are the magazines that provide much of the
content on Common Dreams. We desperately need them.

What the Post Office is planning to do now, in the dark of night, is
implement a rate structure that gives the best prices to the biggest
publishers, hence letting them lock in their market position and lessen the
threat of any new competition. The new rates could make it almost impossibl=
e
to launch a new magazine, unless it is spawned by a huge conglomerate.

Not surprisingly, the new scheme was drafted by Time Warner, the largest
magazine publisher in the nation. All evidence available suggests the
bureaucrats responsible have never considered the implications of their
draconian reforms for small and independent publishers, or for citizens who
depend upon a free press.

The corruption and sleaziness of this process is difficult to exaggerate. A=
s
one lawyer who works for a large magazine publisher admits, =CFIt takes a
publishing company several hundred thousand dollars to even participate in
these rate cases. Some large corporations spend millions to influence these
rates.=D3 Little guys, and the general public who depend upon these magazin=
es,
are not at the table when the deal is being made.


The genius of the postal rate structure over the past 215 years was that it
did not favor a particular viewpoint; it simply made it easier for smaller
magazines to be launched and to survive. That is why the publications
opposing the secretive Post Office rate hikes cross the political spectrum.
This is not a left-wing issue or a right-wing issue, it is a democracy
issue. And it is about having competitive media markets that benefit all
Americans. This reform will have disastrous effects for * all* small and
mid-sized publications, be they on politics, music, sports or gardening.


This process was conducted with such little publicity and pitched only at
the dominant players that we only learned about it a few weeks ago and it i=
s
very late in the game. But there is something you can do. Please go to
www.stoppostalratehikes.comand sign the letter to the Postal Board
protesting the new rate system and
demanding a congressional hearing before any radical changes are made. * Th=
e
deadline for comments is April 23*.

I know many of you are connected to publications that go through the mail,
or libraries and bookstores that pay for subscriptions to magazines and
periodicals. If you fall in these categories, it is imperative you get

* Going postal: Washington's recurring attempts to squeeze small magazines
out of business*

When I heard recently about the United States Postal Service's plans to hol=
d
hearings on hiking rates for periodical class mail--the bulk postage class
which gives lower postal rates to magazines--it reminded me of the day in
1995 when I returned to the offices of The Nation after an executive
training program at the Harvard Business School. I had been editing the
magazine for 16 years when Arthur Carter, then the publisher, made me an
offer I should have refused and sold me the magazine for money I didn't
have. As I was making the transition from editor to publisher, imagine then
my consternation on returning from Harvard to discover that the postal
service had recommended the abolition of the the discounted mail class for
periodicals. All of my new financial projections, I feared, would go up in
smoke. We survived that round, but now I am worried again. If implemented,
higher postal rates, whether the originally rumored 15 percent increase or
the recently rumored "6% solution," could bankrupt many small circulation
magazines. Although any change in rates would probably not go into effect
until 2006, it seems to me that now is the time for the independent press
community and all those who care about the free flow of information to
mobilize.

In the mid-1980s, at a conference on the role of journals of opinion that w=
e
co-sponsored with the journalism department at the University of Southern
California, I made a point of putting postal matters at the top of the
agenda, since keeping postage costs under control was one of the few issues
around which journals of the left, right, and center might organize to
mutual advantage. Robert Myers, a former publisher of The New Republic, tol=
d
us about how, in the 1960s, he had put together a group of small-circulatio=
n
magazines whose purpose was precisely to promote their common postal
interests and which had even come up with a constructive proposal that he
persuaded congressman Morris Udall to introduce as legislation: that the
first 250,000 copies (in Udall's bill, it was only 25,000) of all
publications be mailable at reduced rates. That way, smaller publications
and journals with heavy content (perhaps for reasons of high seriousness)
would get the largest proportional benefit, but all magazines would get som=
e
benefit. Alas, the legislation never got anywhere.

 The most articulate opposition to government help for small magazines came=
,
surprisingly, from our friend Michael Kinsley, who had already come out
against the second-class mail "subsidy," as he called it, in a 1975 article
in The Washington Monthly. At the conference he boiled his continuing
objections down to three: Since the readership of journals like The Nation,
The New Republic, and National Review were largely drawn from the highly
educated elite, whose income was above average, the second-class subsidy
therefore amounted to "a transfer of wealth from the poor to the rich."
Second, the camel's nose of government got into the tent of subsidizing
opinion journals, Kinsley argued, content requirements would be inevitably
hooked to the subsidy, raising profound First Amendment concerns; and,
third, since opinion journalists were supposed to be watchdogs against
special interests, it was wrong for us to become one ourselves. Kinsley
observed that right-wingers should oppose such subsidies because they
interfered with the free market, and left-wingers because they were
regressive.

It was a virtuoso performance, and Kinsley, his forensic skills sharpened b=
y
hundreds of hours on "Crossfire," had my vote as captain of the debate team=
.
But then Tom Silk, the lawyer who successfully defended Mother Jones when
the Reagan administration challenged its nonprofit tax status, made a
telling point. Some things are too important to leave to the vicissitudes o=
f
the market, like national defense and clean air--even Kinsley conceded that
these two were "public goods"--and public discourse and the dissemination o=
f
literature were two more.

And so, in 1995, when the trade press reported that the Postal Service
(USPS) wanted to abolish second-class mail, my first impulse was to write a=
n
op-ed piece denouncing that agency. But that, I quickly realized, was the
writer in me wanting to sound off. Now that I was a publisher (ahem) I had
bigger guns to deploy. As a member of the Magazine Publishers Association
(MPA), I assumed my trade group would be up in arms. So imagine my further
consternation when I discovered that not only was the MPA not interested in
challenging the USPS proposal, they were supporting it.

I had foolishly believed that since the MPA has a membership of 250
magazines, and since most of these magazines have circulations of 250,000 o=
r
under, they would represent their members' interest. No such luck; 20
percent of the MPA's members are responsible for 80 percent of its budget.
Karl Marx was out of fashion, but he would surely have reminded me that if =
I
had simply looked at the figures, I could have predicted MPA's position, th=
e
position of the mega-publishers, the position of Time Warner and Dow Jones.

Probably too soon -- too much grief still in the air -- to launch

Va. Tech Gunman Writings Raised Concerns
Apr 17, 01:16 PM EDT
By ADAM GELLER - AP National Writer

BLACKSBURG, Va. (AP) -- The gunman suspected of carrying out the
Virginia Tech massacre that left 33 people dead was identified
Tuesday as an English major whose creative writing was so disturbing
that he was referred to the school's counseling service.

News reports also said that he may have been taking medication for
depression, that he was becoming increasingly violent and erratic,
and that he left a note in his dorm in which he railed against "rich
kids," "debauchery" and "deceitful charlatans" on campus.

Cho Seung-Hui, a 23-year-old senior, arrived in the United States as
boy from South Korea in 1992 and was raised in suburban Washington,
D.C., officials said. He was living on campus in a different dorm
from the one where Monday's bloodbath began.

Police and university officials offered no clues as to exactly what
set him off on the deadliest shooting rampage in modern U.S. history.

"He was a loner, and we're having difficulty finding information
about him," school spokesman Larry Hincker said.

Professor Carolyn Rude, chairwoman of the university's English
department, said she did not personally know the gunman. But she said
she spoke with Lucinda Roy, the department's director of creative
writing, who had Cho in one of her classes and described him as
"troubled."

"There was some concern about him," Rude said. "Sometimes, in
creative writing, people reveal things and you never know if it's
creative or if they're describing things, if they're imagining things
or just how real it might be. But we're all alert to not ignore
things like this."

She said Cho was referred to the counseling service, but she said she
did not know when, or what the outcome was. Rude refused to release
any of his writings or his grades, citing privacy laws.

The Chicago Tribune reported on its Web site that he left a note in
his dorm room that included a rambling list of grievances. Citing
unidentified sources, the Tribune said he had recently shown
troubling signs, including setting a fire in a dorm room and stalking
some women.

ABC, citing law enforcement sources, reported that the note, several
pages long, explains Cho's actions and says, "You caused me to do
this."

Investigators believe Cho at some point had been taking medication
for depression, the Tribune reported.

The rampage consisted of two attacks, more than two hours apart -
first at a dormitory, where two people were killed, then inside a
classroom building, where 31 people, including Cho, died after being
locked inside, Virginia State Police said. Cho committed suicide; two
guns were found in the classroom building.

One law enforcement official said Cho's backpack contained a receipt
for a March purchase of a Glock 9 mm pistol. Cho held a green card,
meaning he was a legal, permanent resident, federal officials said.
That meant he was eligible to buy a handgun unless he had been
convicted of a felony.

Investigators stopped short of saying Cho carried out both attacks.
But ballistics tests show one gun was used in both, Virginia State
Police said.

And two law enforcement officials, speaking on condition of anonymity
because the information had not been announced, said Cho's
fingerprints were found on both guns. The serial numbers on the two
weapons had been filed off, the officials said.

Col. Steve Flaherty, superintendent of the Virginia State Police,
said it was reasonable to assume that Cho was the shooter in both
attacks but that the link was not yet definitive. "There's no
evidence of any accomplice at either event, but we're exploring the
possibility," he said.

Officials said Cho graduated from a public high school in Chantilly,
Va., in 2003. His family lived in an off-white, two-story townhouse
in Centreville, Va.

"He was very quiet, always by himself," neighbor Abdul Shash said.
Shash said Cho spent a lot of his free time playing basketball and
would not respond if someone greeted him. He described the family as
quiet.

Virginia Tech Police issued a speeding ticket to Cho on April 7 for
going 44 mph in a 25 mph zone, and he had a court date set for May 23.

South Korea expressed its condolences, and said it hoped that the
tragedy would not "stir up racial prejudice or confrontation."

"We are in shock beyond description," said Cho Byung-se, a Foreign
Ministry official handling North American affairs.

A memorial service was planned for the victims Tuesday afternoon at
the university, and President Bush planned to attend. Gov. Tim Kaine
was flying back to Virginia from Tokyo for the gathering.

Classes were canceled for the rest of the week.

Many students were leaving town quickly, lugging pillows, sleeping
bags and backpacks down the sidewalks.

Jessie Ferguson, 19, a freshman from Arlington, left Newman Hall and
headed for her car with tears streaming down her red cheeks.

"I'm still kind of shaky," she said. "I had to pump myself up just to
kind of come out of the building. I was going to come out, but it
took a little bit of 'OK, it's going to be all right. There's lots of
cops around.'"

Although she wanted to be with friends, she wanted her family more.
"I just don't want to be on campus," she said.

The first deadly attack was at the dormitory around 7:15 a.m., but
some students said they didn't get their first warning about a danger
on campus until two hours later, in an e-mail at 9:26 a.m., around
the time the second attack began.

Two students told NBC's "Today" show they were unaware of the dorm
shooting when they walked into Norris Hall for a German class where
the gunman later opened fire.

The victims in Norris Hall were found in four classrooms and a
stairwell, Flaherty said. Cho was found dead in one of those
classrooms, he said.

Derek O'Dell, his arm in a cast after being shot, described a shooter
who fired away in "eerily silence" with "no specific target - just
taking out anybody he could."

After the gunman left the room, students could hear him shooting
other people down the hall. O'Dell said he and other students
barricaded the door so the shooter couldn't get back in - though he
later tried.

"After he couldn't get the door open he tried shooting it open ...
but the gunshots were blunted by the door," O'Dell said.

Virginia Tech President Charles Steger emphasized that the university
closed off the dorm after the first attack. He said that before the
e-mail was sent, the university began telephoning resident advisers
in the dorms and sent people to knock on doors to warn them.

"We can only make decisions based on the information you had at the
time. You don't have hours to reflect on it," Steger said.

Until Monday, the deadliest shooting in modern U.S. history was in
Killeen, Texas, in 1991, when George Hennard plowed his pickup truck
into a Luby's Cafeteria and shot 23 people to death, then himself.

Previously, the deadliest campus shooting in U.S. history was a
rampage that took place in 1966 at the University of Texas at Austin,
where Charles Whitman climbed the clock tower and opened fire with a
rifle from the 28th-floor observation deck. He killed 16 people
before he was shot to death by police.

from recovering neo-con, Andrew Sullivan.  To the point.

Imagine that this kind of massacre happened every day. Imagine a police
force that was far too small to even respond to most of
them. Imagine this occurring repeatedly for years until the perpetrators and
their accomplices became the de facto power-brokers
throughout the land. Imagine the shootings also being accompanied by the
brutal torture of victims. Imagine families never having
finality on whether their own siblings or parents or children have been
murdered or not.

This is Iraq today. Now think of the justified rage many feel at the VT
campus police chief and university president for
misjudgments. Now imagine them presiding over several more massacres in the
same place. Ask yourself: why do we not feel as
enraged by those responsible for security in Iraq? Are those victims not
human beings too? Are they not children and mothers and
fathers and sons? Are we not ultimately responsible for them, having
destroyed the institutions of order in their country?

It turns out that the killer was in Lucinda Roy's creative writing class -- something she wasn't aware of when she wrote the op-ed.

The dealer who sold him the guns said "he looked like a nice clean-cut kid."  Aren't they all?  Apparently Virginia's gun laws (if you can call them that) are among the laxest in this cowboy land of ours.

Hi all,

Still no new permanent distributor for Boog City as yet, so I'll be
borrowing my dad's jeep to deliver the paper this Saturday, April 21.

I'm hoping someone might be game to ride along and jump out and drop off the
papers at each of our 33 distribution points. I can pick you up and drop you
back off and, if there's something you've been needing to pick up and
haven't had a vehicle to do so, help you out with that, too.

Please let me know as soon as you can.

THANKS!
david

Stephen,

Sufism did not steal the show, is a significant part of the show, for
centuries.

On the other hand, I can understand your predicament. If so, why don't you
suggest that they write down their dreams, even suggesting techniques how
they can make themselves wake up. Within that framework, Yeats (The Vision,
how he made his wife Lady Gregory (?) write down his dreams. That insanity
may be liberating for the students.

Or let them read Ginsberg's "The White Shroud," the structure of the whole
poem being built around the process of waking up and writing about the
dream. (And an absolutely great poem to boot!).

Or you might discuss with the students what the phrase "content's dream"
mean, one of the great titles in modern poetry. How content itself may be
dreaming, what a suggestive idea, to me, clearly at the heart of Charles's
project. Some students may benefit from these discussions.

The possibilities seem to me quite endless, the surrealist techniques being
"the more traveled" ones among them.

If this were the sixties, I would bring some mescalin to the class room.
Just kidding!

Ciao,

Murat

from the Guardian:

News reports also said that he may have been taking medication for
depression, that he was becoming increasingly violent and erratic,
and that he left a note in his dorm in which he railed against ``rich
kids,'' ``debauchery'' and ``deceitful charlatans'' on campus.

Cho Seung-Hui, a 23-year-old senior, arrived in the United States as
boy from South Korea in 1992 and was raised in suburban Washington,
D.C., officials said. He was living on campus in a different dorm
from the one where Monday's bloodbath began.

Professor Carolyn Rude, chairwoman of the university's English
department, said she did not personally know the gunman. But she said
she spoke with Lucinda Roy, the department's director of creative
writing, who had Cho in one of her classes and described him as
``troubled.''

``There was some concern about him,'' Rude said. ``Sometimes, in
creative writing, people reveal things and you never know if it's
creative or if they're describing things, if they're imagining things
or just how real it might be. But we're all alert to not ignore
things like this.''

She said Cho was referred to the counseling service, but she said she
did not know when, or what the outcome was. Rude refused to release
any of his writings or his grades, citing privacy laws.

A Celebration of Way More West: Selected Poems of Edward Dorn with Jennifer
Dunbar Dorn, editor Michael Rothenberg, Bob Callahan, John Daley, Diane di
Prima, Stephen Emerson, Joanne Kyger, Michael McClure and Duncan McNaughton


Saturday April 28

SF, CA

Edward Dorn was born in the prairie town of Villa Grove, Illinois, on April
2, 1929. After attending Black Mountain College and studying with Charles
Olson, he wandered through the West doing manual and odd jobs before
beginning
to teach, and spent a long period as an academic migrant before accepting a
professorship at the University of Colorado in Boulder in 1978. It was
Dorn's
comic-epic masterpiece Gunslinger, which began appearing in 1968 and had
already become an underground classic by the time it was published in its
entirety in 1974, that established his reputation in the wider world, beyond
those who knew his earlier lyric work, from such volumes as The Newly
Fallen,
Hands Up!, Geography, and The North Atlantic Turbine. He published over 40
books of poetry, prose, and translations before his death in 1999. Way More
West: Selected Poems of Edward Dorn (new from Penguin Poets, 2007), edited
by
Michael Rothenberg and with an introduction by Dale Smith, brings together
poems from Dorn's entire career, including previously uncollected work.

Hi Charles,

80-82 wasn't a bad run either:

Selected Poems, Donald Justice
The Morning of the Poem, James Schuyler
Collected Poems, Sylvia Plath

The vitality of American poetry is found in its small presses; the Pulitzers are almost never drawn from small presses; at best there's a sort of career retrospective recognition 20-30 years after the groundbreaking work gets published.  Jurors tend to include previous winners, so that also ensures consistency, and mostly mainstream types (good luck finding one who hasn't been published in the New Yorker), which determine taste.

Hugh Behm-Steinberg

charles alexander <chax@THERIVER.COM> wrote: the award to Ornette Coleman and special citation to John Coltrane got me
looking through the Pulitzers, back as far as the early 1970s. The special
citation last year to Thelonius Monk was also a highlight.

but the poetry .  . .

I had to go back quite a few years to find works I thought deserving at
all, and there were some, though rarely the best books of their year. Even
in a string of three good years, 1974-1976, with the winners
 The Dolphin, by Robert Lowell
 Turtle Island, by Gary Snyder
 Self-Portrait in a Convex Mirror, by John Ashbery
(and there's no 3-year run I can find with winners as good as those), yes
even those, I have to say, don't sound like clear choices at all as those
years saw the publication of such works as vol. 3 of The Maximus Poems by
Charles Olson, Edward Dorn's Selected Poems 1956-1974, Ted Berrigan's Back
in Boston, Barbara Guest's Moscow Mansions, The Selected Poems of Frank
O'Hara, Adrienne Rich's Poems: Selected and New, two volumes of Robin
Blaser's Image Nations (although I guess Canada doesn't count for the
Pulitzers), The Maintains by Clark Coolidge, Things Stirring Together and
Far Away by Larry Eigner, and, I imagine, many more books I would consider
better than those three winners, and those three are just a few among
Pulitzer winners that I would even want to read. So why are the Pulitzers
so bad at poetry? Mostly I ignore them and don't care. It would be nice,
though, to have a Linh Dinh or Stacy Doris or Beverly Dahlen or Ron
Silliman (yes, The Age of Huts (compleat) for a Pulitzer!) receive that
attention.

Christine Stewart wrote to me last night that Nancy Shaw had died. I
asked her to send me a brief obituary notice, which I am forwarding
to the list. All who knew Nancy will join Christine and me, and the
Kootenay School of Writing poetry community, in raging against her
death but also celebrating her poetry, poetics, and contribution to
the world our poetry collectively makes.

*****

Nancy Shaw born May 24th, 1962, died early Monday morning April 16th,
2007. A founding member of the Kootenay School of Writing in
Vancouver, Shaw authored Affordable Tedium (Tsunami 1991) and
Scoptocratic (ECW Press 1992). She also collaborated on several
chapbooks with Catriona Strang, including Busted (Coach House Books
2001, http://www.chbooks.com.) and most recently Cold Trip (Nomados
2006). In addition, Shaw was a visual artist, curator and wrote for
various art catalogues.

A service will be held in Vancouver at St.Andrew's-Wesley Church,

When I first saw the headline "massacre", I actually thought it was
referring to the carnage of the most recent car bombs (what, 54 dead?) No
disrespect to the dead at Virginia, it is unambiguously a terrible thing,
but there is something deeply discomforting about the coverage.

All best

Yes.
Please don't take this as flippancy, but it's fortuitous for those
who need to deflect attention from the Gonzales hearing for instance....

Also, R.I.P Nancy Shaw, who I deeply admired.

Call for Papers: AWP Panel, In Praise of: 13 Ways to Be Mentored

Mentoring often happens in private, between a person and a book, one writer
alone with a few pages of someone's text, another writer she feels
inexplicably drawn to. Who are the writers we return to? And for what
reasons?
How do writers enter an alternative form of mentorship with writers they've
only met on the page? This panel will explore how emerging writers of color
have been influenced by the aesthetics, content, and/or craft of other
writers of
color, how they feel mentored by these writers whom they've met on the page.

This panel will be proposed for the 2008 AWP Conference, and while it is
intended as a scholarship panel, anyone interested should be mindful that the
conference panels focus mainly on the art and act of writing. The accepted
papers
will draw attention to particulars of writing that attract & speak to you
as a
writer of color, for example, form, structure, style, theme, language,
tone, etc. I hope
to hear from folks writing in all genres: poems, plays, prose.

I'm taking submissions of short abstracts (no more than 100 words), with a
deadline of 24 April 2007. I will contact with you a final decision by 27
April 2007.

Contact Information: Metta Sama (mae_b@mac.com)

I look forward to hearing from you.


Call for Papers: AWP Panel, Tribute of Herb Scott, poet, editor, teacher,
mentor, friend

This panel will be a tribute to visionary teacher, leader, organizer, editor,
mentor, friend, & poet Herb Scott, founder and editor of New Issues Press,
author of _Groceries_, _Disguises_, and _Sleeping Woman_,and professor
at Western Michigan University. The panel will be 2-fold, 1-part essay/
reflections on your personal intersection with Herb, and 1-part reading of
Herb's
poems. Your paper (in its final stage) should be no more than 5 minutes long,
and you will have 8 minutes to read poems of Herb Scotts that you have
chosen.

Interested parties should send a very brief abstract (about 100 words) that
includes names of poems they're interested in reading, as well as a general
description of the type of essay they'd like to deliver (i.e. personal
reflection
on Herb as an editor, critical reflection on Herb building New Issues press,
reflection on Herb as teacher, reflection on Herb as mentor, as friend,
etc.).

Interested parties can reach me at mae_b@mac.com, & I need to have
the responses in by 24 April 2007. I will inform everyone who has been
selected to participate by 27 April 2007, and will have the proposal ready
forvreview on 29 April 2007. To offer a balanced panel, I will chose one
ex-student, one editor (either current or past of New Issues Press), one
friend/colleague, one New Issues author (who could discuss their relationship
with Herb-as-editor), and one (hopefully) editor of an independent press (who
could offer some insight on building a press while maintaining one's
identity as
a poet). Please note, however, that this is all open to change, is fluid.

This is to all poet/teachers in the wake of the Virginia Horror.

The shooter seems to have been attending off-roster classes and getting away with simply being there.

If your school is like my school, horrible ineptitude in scheduling allows such a situation to become commonplace.

Aside from the academic failure that bad scheduling practices promote, we have this -- to what extent does such administrative ineptitude create the sloppiness that allows such horrors to happen?

Such situations endanger both students and teachers.  Students suffer academically and personally.  Teachers are always at risk on some many and increasingly bizarre levels.

In a national environment where across-the-board teacher bashing is even more popular than Bush-era xenophobia, I would humbly suggest that this current horror envinces a failure in our national non-dialog on education reform that goes completely undiscussed: Why aren't we looking at where the real opportunities for waste and ineptitude exist -- at the administrative level where binding decisions are made and money is spent/wasted.  Blame the teachers--it's easier!  Almost everyone everywhere in our vastly undereducated country has a grudge against at least one teacher!

The stupid questions about this horror are already being formed: Why didn't his teachers see he was disturbed?  Weren't there warning signs the teachers could have noticed?  Why in our extremely violent society was his imaginative writing so violent?

Teachers, we need to turn the beat around!  Why didn't the Administration know where he was? Where he wasn't?  What systems were not in place to allow teacher to completely know who was or was not legally entitled to be in their classrooms?  If a teacher did notice something amiss, was there any administrative support for the teacher to follow up?  Did the administration do its part and actually do the follow up? Was the teacher updated of administrative attempts to follow up?

Far more money is truly wasted at the administrative level than is ever wasted in any classroom anywhere.  Any honest MBA or CPA knows the essential truth of this in any organization of any form.

With the weight of cynicism on our shoulders, let's all take bets and watch how the media seeks to put the onus for discovering such lunatics solely upon the teachers.  Let's all watch as they hang this one University president, and fail to review administrative ineptitude across the board.  Let's watch other University presidents and high school principals cluck their blackened and guilt swollen tongues at the misfortune of their fallen brother.  let's listen to the silence of many, many more.

Remember that half of all graduates, at any level, anywhere in our country, graduated in the bottom half of their graduating classes (they had to by virtue of simple mathmatics).  No wonder so many people love to blame their teachers and not themselves!  I can't think of a single person who blames the Principal.  Can you?

In our simplistic society we like our scapegoats to appear singularly and in black and white simplicity.

This has happened before; there is nothing new under the sun; it will happen again!

Fraternally yours,
Wil Hallgren

Teacher had Cho moved out of class
ALAN FREEMAN
Globe and Mail Update
BLACKSBURG, Va. — One of Cho Seung-Hui's English professors at Virginia
Tech said Wednesday that she so feared the intimidating nature of
23-year-old English student that she threatened to resign if he were not
removed from her class.

"He was a very intimidating student to my other students," poetry
professor Nikki Giovanni said. As a result of his disturbing presence and
his graphic writing,she actually wrote to the chairman of the English
Department, Lucinda Roy, asking that he be removed from her class, which
he was.

"I was willing to resign before I was going to continue with him," Ms.
Giovanni told CNN.

Mr. Cho killed 32 students and faculty members at the university on
Monday, the worst such shooting in U.S. history before ending his own
life.

"There was something mean about this boy, and it was the meanness that
bothered me," she said.

On Monday, as she heard about the shooting while travelling back to the
university from California and there were rumours that the perpetrator was
Asian, she said she knew immediately that he was Mr. Cho.

"In front of my mind, I knew it was" him, she said in an interview.

Ms. Roy, the department chairwoman, said she brought Ms. Giovanni's
concerns to university authorities and the campus police but was told that
because he was expressing himself freely in his writings, there was
nothing that could be done.

As a result of these concerns, she had him removed from class and began to
teach Mr. Cho privately in a special workshop.

Ms. Roy said that Mr. Cho appeared to be deeply disturbed, "very withdrawn
and very depressed."

"There was this steady tone of anger in his writings. It seemed as if he
was expressing emptiness and fury at himself and at people around him,"
Ms. Roy said.

She said that was worried that Mr. Cho could be a threat to other students
as well as to himself.

"I really felt very strongly that he was suicidal, that he was so
depressed that he had a negativity about him, like it was like talking to
a hole sometimes, that the person wasn't really there," she said.

"Of course, we never imagined these kinds of things."

Wikipedia writes on the Giovanni page today -

[On April 17, 2007, at the Virginia Tech Convocation commemorating the April
16 Virginia Tech massacre, Giovanni closed the ceremony, stating, "We are
sad today, and we will be sad for quite a while. We are not moving on. We
are embracing our mourning. We are Virginia Tech... We do not understand
this tragedy... Neither does the baby elephant watching his community be
devastated for ivory..No one deserves a tragedy."]

I didn't quite get the "ivory" metaphor.

The fact that Cho was an English student, is unfortunate and might tempt
many of us in this list to face our own mirrors. I am also curious why
Cho chose the "Science & Engineering" class as the venue for his second
killing spree! Did he see that community as some sort of a "privileged"
section of the academic society ? Did the "debauchery" he hated, came
mostly from those quarters ?

We'll never know. However, as a poet engaged in engieering practice,
I'm almost compelled to raise this question.

If we take the gun out of the picture, Cho's story might sound quite
familiar with many of us who grew up in a foreign society and went to
foreign universities. In fact, in much of the developing world, where
walls are far steeper between liberal arts and science, so much so, that
a chance of making a respectable livelihood in the arts arena is rarer than
"ivory"; frustrations do become paramount, and they do manifest themselves
....but we don't get to hear of such campus-massacres. Of course, there
are many like me, who give up the dream of pursuing fine arts for the
fear of going astray, and study engineering because they are also good at
math.

Sadly, the tragedy turns four-fold when a gun gets into the picture.

because he was expressing himself freely in his writings, there was nothing
that could be done."

But where is this going? Police powers for creative writing teachers? The
fact is, Cho Seung-Hui had been reported to the police for harassing and
threatening women, which means this horror would have been prevented by a
simple background check before guns were made available to him. We can wring
our hands all we want about whether there were failures on the part of
"university authorities," but if a background check had been required, this
would not have happened. Sorry, I know this isn't poetics, but it seems like
an important point to make.

1.  At my alma mater, Michigan State, there is a steep divide between the
arts and sciences--and in many of these "second tier" type schools, this is
becoming the nrm.  So much so that a university administrator told a group
of graduate students 2 months ago that the arts and humanities have gotten
all the money they are going to get.   He added that the only useful thin a
philosopher/english phd/artist could do would be to make the world more
comfortable with science.  In fact, the University is making no great pains
to maintain these humanities and arts programs beyond the bare minimum that
is required to keep our status as a "research one" institution.  The arts
and sciences divide is HUGE here--and, frankly, I only know one person who
is an artist and makes a living from it (that would be my poetry prof)--here
in Michigan, it's tough enough to make a living.

2.  The shooter did pass a background check.  The scary thing is that he was
manipulative enough to repress those terrifying aspects of his personality
and not "spill the beans" on how disturbed he really was.

3.  The shooter was removed from classes not simply because his writings
were violent, but because he (and his work) personally intimidated: the
teacher (Ms. Giovanni); two other students, who stopped coming to class.
Additionally, he was taking photographs in class of other students (by
hiding the camera under his desk).  Ever prof I have ever had is smart
enough to know the difference between "self-expression" and downright
disturbing.  This has nothing to do with creative-writing profs being given
police powers.  It has everything to do with having a responsibility to
protect your students; in my experience, when someone "creeps you out"
enough that you have them removed from your class, you're generally right.

All of this info was on cnn.com today;

Could someone clarify something for me?

I know he had harrassment complaints from women on campus-- but did anyone
actually press charges against him and was he ever put on trial and found
guilty?  Was he ever even issued with a restraining order?

You see the problem here is that anyone can make a complaint-- and it is
entirely possible for a complaint to be scurrilous, or for that matter for a
complaint to be dropped.  A lot of people who go to the police to complain
about stalking will in fact drop the complaint if the stalking behaviour
stops-- heck, I remember being mildly stalked when I was an undergraduate
and I happily put the issue aside when the creepy guy finally went away.
What happened to these complaints?

Before something like this can go on someone's record (and thus be  the sort
of thing that would turn up in a  background check)  it has to go past the
complaint stage-- there has to be some sort of follow-through and due
process.  Same with restraining orders-- I always get upset when people
claim that its easy to get a restraining order on somebody.  In point of
fact, it can be pretty difficult, especially if you are not in an intimate
relationship with the person.  There has to have been an actual threat made
against a person.

This whole thing is absolutely heartwrenching.  I applaud both Lucinda and
Nikki for doing what they could.  It may very well be that this man was
pushing the boundary for a very long time, stopping just short of where he
would actually have to face charges-- until the other day.  That's what it
sounds like to me.

Yes. Important considerations for many of us. =20

I saw Giovanni on CNN this am and she was highly articulate and =
intelligent
and wonderfully human. One thing she did mention was that hundreds of =
young
writers in workshops write things that are violent and angry and most of
them are alright. I, too, hope this doesn't put a chill in the creative

PS: A note about the disturbing disproportion between
coverage of violence in Iraq and elsewhere and that of
Virginia Tech: my experience of human beings
everywhere has shown me that we worry about what's
close to home much more readily than things far away.
It's much less a "racial" issue than a psychological
one found everywhere. This, of course, doesn't make it
any less troubling, and in this country there are
plenty of signs of dehumanizing Iraqis et al. because
of their otherness, even if I don't think the
disproportionate coverage is one of them.

This is starting to remind me (more as a point of a contrast) with
that incident in San Francisco a few years back, when Jan Richman
brought disturbing writings by a student to the attention of her
chair. The student was promptly exprelled, but then they fired Ms.
Richman too.
Many protested; Rushdie and Eggers, et al, wrote letters of support.
Stories in national press, etc. But Richman didn't get reinstated at
her job.

*****************

  I feel really uncertain about this--probably because I had a very
similar thing happen to me.

A few years ago, a young man who was a student at the college where I
teach--and indeed, had been a student in my creative writing
course--murdered his girlfriend.  The authorities confiscated his
computer and on it found stories he wrote for my class that they found
"disturbing."  I was subpeoned to testify in court--his lawyer wanted
me to testify as to his state of mind, having read his short stories.
I was appalled (and was never actually called to the stand--I think his
lawyer figured out I would be rather hostile): I can't testify to
someone's state of mind--I'm an English teacher, not a psychologist or
mental health expert!

Were his stories creepy?  No more than say, oh, Stephen King's stories!
  When I heard the teacher on the radio this morning say, "you can just
tell that something's off" I really worried--for every depressed kid in
a creative writing class anywhere in the nation...because there sure as
hell aren't any of those people..!

Now clearly, this kid at VA Tech was more than depressed...but where do
we draw the line? What do people think they can "just tell" by reading
someone's fiction or poetry or whatever?  I haven't seen anything that
this kid wrote--and maybe it was beyond the pale--but so is Was
Craven's stuff, and so was Poe's and Baudelaire's--and as a writer and
a teacher, I worry that we are on the verge of a dangerous precedent
here...

  It also gives "creative writing" a bad--or at least limited--rap: that
all writing is "confessional."  God, can we please get past that?!  And
if we don't--if that is all that "creative writing" teachers
stress--that writing is solely personal, confessional, expressive--what
do we expect we'll get?

I'm sad and confused by all of this...not the least of which this
growing notion that English teachers are supposed to be able to judge
someone's mental state...

I've taken, by my count, at least 6 semesters of writing courses.  Never
once was there a person who scared other students, intimidated them, etc.
Never once was someone's poetry or or fiction or personal essay so
disturbing as to make me uneasy.  I think there is a marked difference
between just having a disturbing storytelling ability (a la Stephen King)
and being a sociopath, who is in writing classes only because he can outlet
some of his twistedness there (as opposed to say a math class).  There were
always pleanty of terrible poems, and goth kids, and "depressed" kids (I'm
not being sarcastic, I know people who are biochemically imbalanced, and
that's a hell of a lot different then what a lot of kids in writing classes
are, which isn't depressed, but looking for attention/playing a role). No
one was ever scared of them.

I saw Giovanni on CNN this am and she was highly articulate and intelligent
and wonderfully human. One thing she did mention was that hundreds of young
writers in workshops write things that are violent and angry and most of
them are alright. I, too, hope this doesn't put a chill in the creative
writing classroom.

What if this does put a chill in the creative writing classroom? What if creative writing programs were eliminated? Would this have the effect of improving North American poetry in general?

It would be sad to see people lose their jobs and I don't want to minimize that, but there has been an explosion in these writing programs and I am not sure there has been a similar increase in the quality of work on this continent in that time.

But where is this going? Police powers for creative writing teachers? The
fact is, Cho Seung-Hui had been reported to the police for harassing and
threatening women, which means this horror would have been prevented by a

Suzanne,

Apparently the young women did not press charges. You are right, it is not easy to get a restraining order, even if the police advise you to get one (as happened to me). It is expensive to hire a process server and there's a lot of bureaucracy and the attitude and obstacles that go with that. If the stalker is a seemingly "nice guy" and/or someone with money and stature, it becomes even harder to go through with getting a restraining order. And then if the person stops harrassing you, you're right, one is so happy to let it go. Of course the stalker, whether a weird loner or a seemingly nice upstanding guy, then goes on to stalk some other woman. And if and when these incidents erupt in violence, earlier victims will appear, and a pattern and timeline for the now inevitable disaster is established.

I don't think the emphasis should be (or is) on freedom of expression and the policing of it. It has to be about easy access to guns, with or without an official criminal background check. Although creative writing classes play a role in this incident, there are tons of others where it plays no role. It's a red herring, as is the emphasis on this one crazy individual, or on his Korean nationality. There will be another well-armed madman at another school, post office, or Burger King before too long. This is about what such people do with GUNS, not pens and paper.

Predictably, the NRA folks are posting on the Times VA TECH story blogs, saying that this
murderer could have been stopped if everyone on campus had been packing guns . . . What they don't say is, if everyone on campus were packing guns, stuff like this would happen more often, whenever people are in despair, angry, chemically unbalanced, at a loss for any perspective at all on the trials of life.

And what if everyone in that German class had been carrying guns but couldn't move fast enough to stop the killer? You can bet that many of those fine, gun-toting citizens
would be out killing innocent Koreans in revenge. Hell, if I had a gun and my child had been attacked or slaughtered, I'd be dangerous. And I am sure I am not unique in this regard.

It doesn't have to be like this in America. It shouldn't be like this.


 * * *

I know he had harrassment complaints from women on campus-- but did anyone
actually press charges against him and was he ever put on trial and found
guilty?  Was he ever even issued with a restraining order?

You see the problem here is that anyone can make a complaint-- and it is
entirely possible for a complaint to be scurrilous, or for that matter for a
complaint to be dropped.  A lot of people who go to the police to complain
about stalking will in fact drop the complaint if the stalking behaviour
stops-- heck, I remember being mildly stalked when I was an undergraduate
and I happily put the issue aside when the creepy guy finally went away.
What happened to these complaints?

Before something like this can go on someone's record (and thus be  the sort
of thing that would turn up in a  background check)  it has to go past the
complaint stage-- there has to be some sort of follow-through and due
process.  Same with restraining orders-- I always get upset when people
claim that its easy to get a restraining order on somebody.  In point of
fact, it can be pretty difficult, especially if you are not in an intimate
relationship with the person.  There has to have been an actual threat made
against a person.

This whole thing is absolutely heartwrenching.  I applaud both Lucinda and
Nikki for doing what they could.  It may very well be that this man was
pushing the boundary for a very long time, stopping just short of where he
would actually have to face charges-- until the other day.  That's what it
sounds like to me.

Desnos was one of the the French Surrealists who had the most facility for
slipping into trances and bringing forth amazing dream texts--Crevel was
another--but I think it was the proto-Surrealist Saint-Pol-Roux who hung the
sign on his door.

Just to clarify one small point: in most if not all colleges and
universities in Canada (and, I'd expect, south of the border) faculty =
can
exclude any and all students whose behaviour is "disruptive" i.e. makes =
it
impossible for students to give the matter of the course their =
attention,
and for the faculty likewise to get on with the business of the course. =
One
does not do this lightly, and one does not do without discussing it with =
(at
the very least) middle management (i.e. department or programme heads) =
and
presumably after discussing it with the student.=20
It is not a question of "disturbing writings" but of "disruptive =
behaviour."

Both plays can be found here:

http://newsbloggers.aol.com/2007/04/17/cho-seung-huis-plays/

I would not have seen enough on the basis of these two plays (even with
their violence, exaggerated and occasionally inexplicable action, sexual
valences, language, etc.) to have notified the authorities.

I'm just basing this on these two plays, not behavior or anything else.
Would anyone else have discussed the student's problems with a chair or the
consoling services simply on the basis of these? This question seems worth
asking though it only touches part of the tragedy.

Having seen this attributed to a number of French poets, including Pierre-Jean Jouve and Gerard de Nerval as well as Desnos, I'd be hesitant to accept any as correct without a reliable citation.

  You can't keep a good line down.

David,

PS: A note about the disturbing disproportion between
coverage of violence in Iraq and elsewhere and that of
Virginia Tech: my experience of human beings
everywhere has shown me that we worry about what's
close to home much more readily than things far away.
It's much less a "racial" issue than a psychological
one found everywhere. This, of course, doesn't make it
any less troubling, and in this country there are
plenty of signs of dehumanizing Iraqis et al. because
of their otherness, even if I don't think the
disproportionate coverage is one of them.

In Vancouver there's a man on trial for murdering many women. He was a pig
farmer and is accused of grinding the women up and feeding them to the pigs;
their DNA has been found around the farm. And there's a serial killer loose
on one of the highways in BC.

There's a lot of murderous crazy anger in Canada/BC too, George, as I'm sure
you know. It isn't a specifically USAmerican thing. The details may be
marked with circumstances specific to the nation where it festered, but the
disease does not acknowledge national boundaries.

Yes, I agree that George's comment was astute, but it only raised more ques=
tions for me. For example, soon after I read George's pithy response to my =
rather long post, I read a Pew poll that said that 69% of Americans know th=
at Cheney is V.P. (the rest don't).

Of course we know they mean USAians when they say Americas.

So then I got to wondering if Canadians actually call themselves Americans =
in daily life, the way we USAians do. And do people in Europe, the Middle E=
ast, and Africa, for example, include Canadians when they deride Americans?=
 And are Canadians mistaken or properly taken for Americans when they trave=
l overseas?

And isn't "American" so associated with the U. S. that it is difficult or i=
mpossible to recoup it for other purposes, whatever it means geographically=
?

Meanwhile, all over the world, not just in Canada and the U.S., guys with g=
reat potential to do harm often start by intimidating/harrassing/stalking w=
omen. And though great strides have been made in U. S. courts and police de=
partments with regard to human rights for women, such things are still not =
taken terribly seriously.

If the "why" was addressed to Peter Quartermain's comment, in the case of
Nikki Giovanni and this particular student, she had two other students
refusing to attend class anymore because of his behavior: she said in an
interview that he was taking photos of other students with his cell phone
under the table.  This was a case of both "disturbing writing" AND
"disruptive behavior"--it's probably just that the disruptive behavior can't
be sent all around the internet and be watched on CNN after the fact, so
it's not getting as much attention.

Is anyone bringing this up with the classes that they're teaching now?  I
feel like it would be good to give my students the space to talk over the
tragedy a little if they want to, but wonder if anyone has strategies for
guiding the discussion positively.

(at least I had that part right). Silly me! Here's the
quote:

Saint-Pol-Roux faisait naguere placer, sur la porte de
son manoir de Camaret, un ecriteau sur lequel on
pouvait lire: LE POETE TRAVAILLE."

I never liked guns to begin with, but I grew up around hunters, so I did
have a small tolerance for hunting rifles up to two days ago.  Va. Tech
has made a believer out of me--NO MORE GUNS FOR AMERICAN CITIZENS.
Interestingly enough, we have a gun scandal going on here in Japan.  The
mayor of Nagasaki was shot down by the Yakusa.  It's made national
headlines.

Don't know if Nikki Giovanni meant to give the impression of passing on
blame to Roy and the other creative writer at Virginia Tech during her
CNN interview, but her speech could certainly have been interpreted as
an attempt to do so.  Should creative writing "professors" be required
to take classes in abnormal psychology, or have certification in various
fields of counseling and social work?  Stay tuned. Jess

I get so outraged when people make that absurd wild west argument that the
solution to the situation is for EVERYONE to have guns.  Gee, even
children?  This sort of logic is the sign of things really breaking down.
It's absurd, its dangerous, and while we are at it it didn't even work in
the "wild west".  More people having guns = a greater likelihood that your
gun will be stolen or used against you or picked up by a small child, etc.
It means nobody is safe.  *fume*

I can't believe that we live in a cuntry where so many people cannot get
emdical care (including mental health services)  but anyone can get a gun.
I heard  commentator on the radio last night who made the point that if an
anti-depressant caused 30,000 deaths a year, you bet we would control it--
but nobody wants to control the guns. *fume*

It also just came out today that yes in fact the killer WAS declared a
danger to himself and others-- but almost nothing was done about it.

I am so outraged I can't even speak.  Holy crap.

But I can't find the context for Paul's original posting.
I think his question about content in poetry is interesting. Not as a direct
response, but in the same vein: last week I heard a poetry reading and one
of the women introduced her work with a long presentation of her problems
dealing with her incest issues and how difficult her relationships were with
her mother and sister etc. etc. She spoke for about 5 or 6 minutes before
reading her poem. When she was finished two people in the audience stood and
applauded and whistled. So, my question is how often context plays a role in
poetry? Is that valid in terms of evaluating quality?

After a couple days trying not to think about Virginia, lots of
things seem to be coalescing around this discussion. One of the news
stories that got back-paged after Tuesday was the meeting between
Russell SImmons and several other prominent CEO's with ties to the
hip-hop industry (and lets not forget that there is one) about the
fallout form the Imus thing. Simmons had interesting things to say.

"Whether it's our sexism, our racism, our homophobia or our violence,
the hip-hop community sometimes can be a good mirror of our dirt and
sometimes the dirt that we try to cover up," Simmons said. "Pointing
at the conditions that create these words from the rappers ... should
be our No. 1 concern."

I'm recalling the year I spent volunteer-teaching a creative writing
class in Alameda County Juvenile Hall. I'm sure there's other people
on this list who have worked in detention facilities, youth or adult,
and maybe you have thoughts on this. When I moved away from very
specific craft exercises and opened up the floor to whatever they
were writing, very violent stuff immediately made its way in. To this
day, I think the majority of those kids (and the whole time I taught
there, that's what I kept thinking every week- these are kids!) were
grand-standing and posing, participating in a certain dialogue which
applauds boasting about ones potential for violence. At the same
time, I know for a fact that some of these kids' actions were indeed
as violent as their writing. When I started to piece all of this out
and try to establish some guidelines for how we would proceed in
class, it got incredibly complicated incredibly quickly.

On one hand, the presence of the "confessional" voice had a very
literal meaning- anything they said in detention could become
evidence, and whenever one of them got a court date or an actual
conviction, they would come back the next week thinking I was a
snitch- i.e. they were worried their poems had become confessions. I
had to start warning them against writing "confessionally", i.e.
against portraying actual events of their lives. At the same time,
the staff there wanted the class to be all about positivity- staff
didn't want the word "nigger" to appear in their poems (which was
used by all the kids, latino, black, loatian, even white- and none of
them ever blinked or seemed to think it was an issue), didn't want
drug use represented or glorified (which was an even more common
theme than violence in their writings), and of course didn't want
violence or references to guns or weapons. But, as depressing as it
sounds, the removal of these topics left these kids with nothing they
found worth writing about. Everything that was salient and poetic to
them was criminal/criminalized, right down to the name of the street
they live on (which signifies "turf", and "turf" is also illegal).

So, while my dilemma didn't involve asking whether to report the
writings of my students to authorities (they were already in the
room), I often return to this experience when I teach in other
classrooms. One thing I tried to do, in order to keep them writing,
was to let them write what they were going to write, and ask them to
analyze it with me. If it was a character they were creating, which
was their assignment one time, I asked them what they intended their
audience to think about that character, whether anyone besides the
character himself would applaud his actions. In short, I tried to
have an ethical discussion with them, one time going so far as to
look at passages of Plato's Republic (Book II, I think, where
Socrates argues that it is better to suffer injustice than commit
it). Like anyone, these students had a rich and complex ethical
world, and felt accountable when they fell short of those ethics or
discovered an inconsistency. The rules I established about writing
came out of those discussions, and they were quite simply that you
ought not write something that you would find indefensible in actual
practice (I think you could create a tertiary guideline that says if
you're doing so consciously, as in writing form an anti-hero or such,
you ought to have some intention behind what you're doing to people's
expectations of good and just behavior). The results were very mixed,
with some students continuing to write comfortably in these
perimeters, and some completely turning off, but it did allow me not
to have to forbid them upfront from writing any particular poem or
story.

I still use this notion in other classrooms. I get right up in the
face of someone writing something I think is indefensible ethically,
and often require that a defense be presented to credit it as work
for the course. That second level of writing, the apology, is usually
richer and more interesting that the original stuff. So I guess
that's my contribution to the discussion on how to proceed in writing
classes. I don't try to draw the distinction between writing that's
just writing and writing that's somehow symptomatic of real
disturbance- the writing itself is an act, with its own set of
repercussions. I deal with those, because that's all I'm equipped to
deal with. Of course, I also try to get any student who seems to be
having real trouble to appropriate counseling services (and I've been
lucky enough to have classrooms small enough to recognize this- which
is to me the best argument for keeping those small class sizes that
writing departments everywhere are constantly trying to defend), and
I take it Ms. Giovanni and Ms. Roy acted about as well as anyone
possibly could have, even going beyond normal expectations of
identifying and working with a troubled student. But I don't think we
simply let all the students who are writing purely fictitiously, the
ones we have no suspicion of going out and acting on violent
fantasies, off the hook. The writing itself needs accounting for, and
even treated casuistically, needs some good reason for existing.

Without trying at all to limit the issue of the ways in which creative
writing or any other kind of teacher deals with "disruption" or bullying
behavior and more serious possibilities of potential violent catastrophe
(all important), I think we should also be interested in 'the shooter' and
the culture of revenge that fed into this event - no matter how
pathologically - the his justification for his actions. I remember vividly
the shift in vocabulary of the Bush Administration after 9/11 - how they
loved to use the word/verb "kill." It was never about bringing anybody to
justice - the options were either to kill or, apparently, torture the
perceived enemy, and, again, apparently, if you did not have an enemy
crossing your national doorstep, you would invent an invader and kill it
too. (I remember Rumsfeld before an audience of troops in Missouri pounding
the podium and gleefully celebrating the number of the enemy that had been
"killed" and thinking this guy is really a murderer in the disguise of
public office).   There was never talk of bringing x, y or z "to justice",
that is bringing things into balance and order. "Islamic  radicalists" etc.
are never be considered for negotiation, etc., but be snuffed continuously
in a war that can go forever.
The revenge mindset is clearly that of Cheney and Bush and seeps into the
culture everywhere in this country, including the battlefields and the
'revenge' killings of civilians by marines in Iraq and Afghanistan.
But this kid in Virginia - reading his 'well-written' reprinted pieces of
rage, no matter what marbles were let loose in him, he was carrying a huge
amount of pain (sexual, racial, class). His solution was to resort to the
models, the well known scripts that are pummeled into the culture
everywhere. I actually recently saw the movie, "Shooter", which is equally
all about righteous revenge - not bringing to justice, but killing every one
known or perceived to be part of the plot to eliminate the shooter. The
movie was preceded by 5 preview trailers with the same roaring dolby sound
violent revenge motifs.
It's both the ancient and contemporary masculine myth rolled into one. If
somebody's in your way, kill 'em. And cheer.

Cho, in his own demented way, was behaving according to well known violent
revenge scripts (from Bush to Hollywood to our streets). Why no one - from
an early age - was able to reach out to Cho, or in one way or other, respond
effectively and compassionately to whatever was legitimate about his rage
and isolation, remains an important part of the question.

In what ways, mad pathologies aside,  can a University - let alone a
creative writing class or the society as a whole - alter revenge scripts?
Or maybe there are other ways to frame the question.

Ismus - was a piece of good news - in that his script (implicitly violent
towards African Americans) was effectively challenged by the women on the
basketball team. Minimally, I think people will think twice before using
that kind of language again as somehow appropriate.

Dillon---
             these are great thoughts, and it certainly re-grounds
the academic poet discussion of the word "confessional" (often seen
more in terms of a trembling Robert Lowell panting and sweating in
the back of a church...)
             One question about your rules for acceptable work in
this context----taking this in particular-- from your post---

       "you ought not write something that you would find
indefensible in actual practice (I think you could create a tertiary
guideline that says if you're doing so consciously, as in writing
form an anti-hero or such, you ought to have some intention behind
what you're doing to people's expectations of good and just behavior)"

I would love to hear more about the 'mixed results' you found as a
result of thus, about how or why you think some students shut down,
and if there's strategies you think you can develop to prevent such
shutting down within those perimeters. I can see how such a rule can
be interpreted, or misinterpreted, by some as being closed off to the
ethical complexity of many situations, dialogue poems (or songs for
that matter) that don't necessarily club the reader over the head
with their moral, and can therefore sometimes be called morally
irresponsible, in presenting that "dirt" of which Russell Simmons
speak. I'm not at all saying that you shouldn't continue to try this,
I'm just curious about why you think some students shut down because
of it.

someone posted a great piece today (sorry, it has been a long week and i
can't remember a thing!) about their experience teaching in a juvenielle
detention center; the most striking bit, i think, was the question of
holding the violent writing accountable.  i.e. removing from the discussion
whether this person was going to hurt someone else.

at what point is violence ever acceptable in art/writing?  i think there are
two paths--a sort of passive violence that reflects something that has
happened to a person/in the news but doesn't glorify it; and then the kind
which seems to be a methos for the author/artist to act out their own
violent temptations--rape scenes, glorified violence, etc.

why is it okay for violence to be part of artistic liscense?  what is there
about, say, a graphic rape or torture scene that can't be better explicated
some other way?  why does rape/murder have to be a method to characterize
something or express oneself?  why don't we see it for what it is--someone
acting out some type of rage.  or looking for an easy, sensational add in to
their work.

if we stop allowing violence to be glamorous, and stop glorifying this
revenge culture, and stop making it so okay to let violence saturate all
things as long as you don't DO IT--will it stop?  i hope so.  it seems to me
to be a case of drawing the line--and in this case, you cannot.  you cannot
simply state that it is okay to write/draw/glorify violence, as long as you
do not hurt people.  the mere act of "putting it out there" compounds the
problem, and makes it incredibly hairy to stop a person from "crossing the
line".  (i feel the same way about the use of the n-word, and the don imus
rant...it's never okay to say those things, no matter what race you are.)

final thought: i hope we (nationally) begin to take a serious look at
stricter gun control.  i know the nra is already all over this--but there is
no way that young man walks around campous and stabs 32 people to death.  we
have got to take a real look at how (even in our choice of words, as another
poster noted today--rumsfield with his KILL KILL KILL) we have made negation
and eradication so attractive and permissible.  we allowed our country to
eradicate two others.  we allowed the government we created to execute a
man, and his former cabinet members.

why, then, are we so surprised that this would happen here?  we have made it
happen everywhere else, and made everyone so passively alright with it, that
we made it frighteningly easy to happen here.

Good comments from Dillon Westbrook and Steve Vincent!  There's one detail that's been studiously avoided by commentators on the Virginia Tech shootings and on Cho: the fact that he had been taking prescription medication.  Given that psychotic side effects are often produced by these one-size-fits-all prescriptions ("take these and get a refill when you're done"), I'm surprised folks haven't been taking aim at the pharmaceutical industry as well as the firearms lobby.

Evidently during middle school and high school, Cho had been bullied and subjected to taunts for his reticence and his "accent" as if all of us don't speak with accents -- "Go back to China," was a particularly ignorant example.  So we also need to look at racism and the Darwinian pecking orders --cliques, petty rivalries, bullying -- of students in the U.S. school system as contributory causes.

And a footnote on Nikki Giovanni: a few decades back, before she became a distinguished professor of creative writing, she wrote a poem called, if memory serves: "nigger can you kill," in which the "interpellated subject" is interrogated as to his/her capacity to kill several allegedly deserving targets, including "a jew."  Several years later, though, she took a trip to apartheid South Africa while a boycott was on!!  (Baraka, himself no stranger to rhetorical violence, called her on that in no uncertain terms -- not one of his more fortunate poetic polemics, either; it was entitled "Niggy the Ho" and went downhill from there.)

Following Rules: An Oulipian Reading with Harry Mathews & Doug Nufer

Born in New York in 1930, Harry Mathews settled in Europe in 1952 and has
since then lived in Spain, Germany, Italy, and (chiefly) France. In 1978 he
returned to the United States to teach for several years at Bennington
College, Columbia University, and the New School University. Now married to
the French writer Marie Chaix, he divides his time between Paris and Key
West. When Mathews published his first poems in 1956, he was associated wit=
h
the so-called New York School of poets, with three of whom (John Ashbery,
Kenneth Koch, James Schuyler) he founded the review Locus Solus in 1961.
Through his friendship with Georges Perec, he became a member of the Oulipo
in 1972. The author of six novels and several collections of poetry, his
most recent publications are Sainte Catherine, a novella written in French
(=C9ditions P.O.L, 2000), The Human Country: the Collected Short Stories

d
Essays (Dalkey Archive Press, 2003), Oulipo Compendium (co-edited with
Alastair Brotchie; Atlas Press and Make Now Press, 2005), and My Life in
CIA: A Chronicle of 1973 (Dalkey Archive Press, 2005). Doug Nufer writes
works of fiction and poetry and pieces for performance that seem to follow
odd procedures, even when they don't. His novels include Never Again,
Negativeland, and most recently, a double novel, The Mudflat Man/ The River
Boys. His fiction and/or poetry has appeared in Chain, Fence, Monkey Puzzle=
,
Bird Dog, and The Golden Handcuffs Review. He also performs his work with

I agree with Chris S's take on Dillon's post. I personally taught for a
couple of years in the Juvenile Hall here in San Francisco. A fantastic
experience on several levels - the creativity with and excitement about
making language challenging, variously accurate, et al.
Yet, I don't think I ever reached the level of getting students to examine
(explore) and defend the use of x, y or z language in a poem, or any other
context. I think Dillon's contribution is vital and useful here whether
among the incarcerated, or quite possible any writing class.   Cho was
apparently a scary, bully of a figure to have in class. I suspect he would
not have cottoned to defending the actions in his writing - where, in the
context of a prison, where good performance is rewarded towards release,
might have risen to the occasion with who knows what results.

Some students, Chris, I think will always close down under the pressure of
limits and potential scrutiny. But maybe that has good consequences for when
they consider actions, counterproductive ones, in other situations.
"Indefensible" might enter their interior dialog!

arousal

certain objects or items on a psychoanalytical scale create arousal; por-
nography operates off this principle. the objects or items are presumed
human, that is to say, projection/introjection (my 'jectivity') occurs
across the threshold of the space between viewer and image. if the items
are non-human, one presumes fetishism (with all the overdetermined accom-
panying psychoanalytic theory), but this need not be the case: given what
elsewhere might be considered dismemberment, but is read here as the dream
screen of the sexual, arousal occurs through a litany of movement and
geometry, nothing more. it's as if we're imprinted (and i think we are to
an extent), as if items appear which construct desire, reproduction,
species. the visual in these cases is a zeroing-in. avatrex.mp4 is an item
(not a human) which simultaneously projects and falls apart; what arouses
are mediated part-objects which seem capable in this respect of standing
alone, standing for, standing in-for. i think all of this relates to a
potential wellspring of violence; if all that's needed is surface, is the
rest of the body to be discarded? an uneasy question, troubling phenomen-
ology as well. http://www.asondheim.org/avartrex.mp4

Ever since these Virginia Tech discussions began on the list, I've been wondering if anyone's read or seen Martin McDonagh's play, THE PILLOWMAN. It's all about writing and storytelling and violence and culpability and torture and versions, in ways I'm still trying to understand.

Hi Dan,

Micah said he responded to you directly.  For anybody else on the list
who might be curious, Some of the World's Diamonds: Pieces from Living
Rooms is a show where individual art pieces/objects from the living
rooms of the artists and poets listed will be hung.  Every person
contributed at least one thing.  There'll be a nice range of style and
medium on display.  Anybody interested and in town should pass by
tomorrow night for a look and some wine, or Weekdays 9-5-ish if you're
in the Mission until May 19th the show's open for viewing whenever
Micah's in his office.

Cheers,

Patrick

That's a great question. I too, like you, can't understand. There IS NO
answer although you might get some replies that attempt to explain what I
would like to call a "fundamental flaw in the system". And I'm also sure
there are many in the list who share the same frustration as us.

In my notation,

Freedom ::Gun = Winged Ants::Fire.

Hey folks, bottom line, the Brits and the French watch the same
movies, have massive immigration issues and racial and class hatreds,
fight stupid wars ojn occasion, take all kinds of medication that
only need to be represcribed after a couple of refills, have
psychotics walking the streets basically untended, and there's the
usual adolescent viciousness. Why don't they have incidents like
Columbine and Va Tech as often as we do (still pretty rare, given our
numbers)?  Aside from some of the amenities of civilized life like
socialized medicine, which really does lower stress levels, and the
incarceration of a much smaller percentage of the population, a major
difference is that the crazies don't have automatic weapons (or guns
of any sort, usually). Lack of means can get you through the hard
times. The mysteries of human motivation don't need to be solved to
change the gun laws.

It's not violence in writing that's the problem. It's the violence in our
relationships, personally and internationally, to the environment, to our
own lives. Children can be exposed to violence in media and suffer no harm
if their home environment is strong and nurturing enough to permit them to
distinguish between fantasy and reality. They can be prevented, in a
mistaken form of protection, from encountering media representations of
violence but be damaged by the violence they encounter in their everyday
lives - I'm speaking about the kinds of controlling violence often embedded
in parental, school, legal authority - and end up totally fucked up. In
fact, representations of violence or other confronting aspects of reality in
the imaginative world might be an important part of developing a child's
moral understanding of self and other, a way of experimenting safely, of
confronting real fears in a way that causes them no actual harm.

I worry deeply that people blame the act of writing for the massacre. From
where I'm looking, that was the least problematic aspect of this boy's
behaviour. I can't help wondering: if he had found a place where he could
imaginatively exercise and work out his violence, would he have been able to
contain it, find some kind of catharsis that didn't involve shooting people?
How many doors were shut by his being thrown out of creative writing classes
because of his offensive work? (Thinking here of John Waters' comment that
if he had not been an artist, he would be a mass murderer). Although I
acknowledge that there were clearly other factors at work, most
significantly mental illness, which is by and large treated as a problem of
controlling excessive behaviour rather than working out what is actually
wrong (complex, I know, and not always something that can be healed).

By this logic, Harold Pinter and Sarah Kane - both writers who have written
plays that brutally confront human violence - would be condemned as
potential mass murderers, or even responsible for the violence they in fact
decry. People seem often very eager to condemn the representation of facets
of existence they don't like, while at the same time refusing to address its
reality. If you say that it's "not ok" to write about violence, where do you
stop? Do we just churn out pap that has nothing to do with the world we live
in, so everyone can feel more comfortable?

All the best

Yes, it is a great question and it's one that many of us ask. Assuming you are not asking this in a completely rhetorical manner, I will hazard an answer that others may augment and/or correct.

The NRA (National Rifle Association, a powerful lobby with money to reward those politicians who agree with it and tarnish and destroy those who oppose it) says that universal access to firearms is a part of the U. S. Constitution, through the 2nd amendment, I believe. The Constitution is a living document, interpreted and reinterpreted nad very rarely amended (or, as it happens, ignored and scorned and undermined by this administration).

Originally the idea was that citizens should be able to combat a militia of tyrants, should the U. S. government become what the founders hoped they'd left behind in Europe: religious zealots with militias, absolute monarchies, etc. (i.e., fascists--we would now say).

I am assuming that your questions were sincere and not completely satirical, though of course there is nothing funny about the anti-democratic, unconstitutional administration under which we are living now--under an executive branch that claims absolute power and exemption from the system of checks and balances that is fundamental to the idea of democracy, that tries to destroy the separation of church and state in the U.S., that ignores the right to privacy, yet supports a "fundmamental" right of all citizens to get hold of guns (including semi-automatic waepons) for any purpose, at any time, with no waiting period and no background check (if the NRA has its way, which it does in many states--and from those states, weapons flowly easily across the U. S. and into the hands of people around the globe).

Worth remembering, as I think someone else on the list noted, that the "weapons" the 2nd amendment was designed to consider were primarily MUSKETS in rural settings in a country that was sparsely populated--not semi-automatic weapons on college campuses, in Burgar Kings, in ghetto neighborhoods, in schools.

I hope I have not been naive in taking your question too literally. On the other hand, what the hell. Millions of people must wonder why this is happening in America. Leaving aside all the extra cultural, macho, economic factors, the U. S. Constitution as abused and misinterpreted by the NRA is the reason for this nightmare.

I leave aside the way that the U. S. government has used weapons to subdue and destroy internal populations of slaves from Africa and their descendants, Native Americans, etc.
There never was any Constitutional provision allowing for that, and the most vehement supporters of the National Rifle Association now would never have supported the right of legitimately endangered people to bear arms against the U. S. government and its sanctioned oppressors, including local police departments, slaveholders, tribal chiefs,  etc.

Chinese translation error blamed for slur on sofa label
POSTED: 9:23 p.m. EDT, April 19, 2007

http://www.cnn.com/2007/WORLD/americas/04/19/canada.couch.ap/index.html

TORONTO, Ontario (AP) -- Doris Moore was shocked when her new couch
was delivered to her Toronto home with a label that used a racial
slur to describe the dark brown shade of the upholstery.

The situation was even more alarming for Moore because it was her 7-
year-old daughter who pointed out "nigger brown" on the tag.

"My daughter saw the label and she knew the color brown, but didn't
know what the other word meant. She asked, 'Mommy, what color is
that?' I was stunned. I didn't know what to say. I never thought
that's how she'd learn of that word," Moore said.

The mother complained to the furniture store, which blamed the
supplier, who pointed to a computer problem as the source of the
derogatory label

Kingsoft Corp., a Chinese software company, acknowledged its
translation program was at fault and said it was a regrettable error.
"I know this is a very bad word," Huang Luoyi, a product manager for
the Beijing-based company's translation software, told The Associated
Press in a telephone interview.

He explained that when the Chinese characters for "dark brown" are
typed into an older version of its Chinese-English translation
software, the offensive description comes up.

"We got the definition from a Chinese-English dictionary. We've been
using the dictionary for 10 years. Maybe the dictionary was updated,
but we probably didn't follow suit," he said.

Moore, who is black, said Kingsoft's acknowledgment of a mistake does
not make her feel better.

"They should know what they are typing, even if it is a software
error," she said. "In order for something to come into the country,
don't they read it first? Doesn't the manufacturer? The supplier?"

Romesh Vanaik, owner of Vanaik Furniture, where Moore bought the
sofa, said it has been a best seller. He said he checked his stock
but found no other couch with the offensive label.

"It's amazing. I've been here since 1972 and I never knew the meaning
of this word," said Vanaik, a native of India.

His supplier, Paul Kumar of Cosmos Furniture in Toronto, denied
responsibility and refused to give the name of the couch's Chinese
manufacturer.

"It's not my fault. It's not the manufacturers' fault," he said,
adding that Kingsoft was to blame.

Huang said Kingsoft has worked to correct the translation error. In
the 2007 version, typing "dark brown" in Chinese does not produce the
racial slur in English. But if the offensive term is typed in
English, the Chinese translation is "dark brown," he said.

Moore is consulting with a lawyer and wants compensation. Last week,
she filed a report with the Ontario Human Rights Commission.

Commission spokeswoman Afroze Edwards said the case is in the initial
stages and could take six months to two years to resolve.

Moore, 30, has three young children, and said the issue has taken a
toll on her family.

"Something more has to be done. We don't just need a personal
apology, but someone needs to own up to where these labels were made,
and someone needs to apologize to all people of color," Moor

My Lost Films


I made films from 1969-1993; most of them were carried by Canyon Cinema in
San Francisco. The films are all mast prints; I didn't copy them, but
showed the originals, since I wanted to use what little funds I had to
produce more. They were shown periodically at Millennium in New York, and
occasionally elsewhere, but they've never been part of the film community;
as a result, they've hardly been shown. Canyon Cinema returned them after
the board voted against handling masters, which could be damaged during a
screening of course. They were then placed at the Filmmakers Coop here in
NY, where they've remained on the shelf for fifteen years; I doubt anyone
has rented or seen them. I don't know their condition at this point; many
of the 16mm ones had mag stripe sound on them, which is susceptible to
print-through.

They were featured prominently in the 1992 Canyon Cinema catalog, just
before Canyon changed its mind about handling them. (I should add that my
videos have been available at times from places like Printed Matter or Art
Metropole, but these can be duplicated.) I'm saddened that they remain
unscreened - there are probably 15-24 hours worth. There are a large
number of them; for a while, when I was teaching at UCLA, I made a film
every week, mostly 16mm black and white sound, imitating the older silent
film production strategies and rates. For me the films broke a lot of new
ground - not least, in optical/magnetic soundtrack experimentation, but
they're quiet, moot on that point.

So I recently found a copy of the 1992 catalog and xeroxed the six pages
that describe my work. I am forced to think of the pages themselves as a
new film, made from the silence of the old; they read as a narrative of
concerns, experimentations, confusions, and theory-work changing over a
twenty-year period (although to be fair, most were made between 1980 and
1992). The image URLs are given below. Read the texts, imagine watching
the films, and maybe in some absurd future, they'll come to life again.

Hi all,
=20
Apologies for the non-Boog/poetry email.
=20
I've renewed my Mets Sunday plan for the 2007 season and I thought I'd see
if any of you might be interested in buying any tickets (and get the poetic
mojo by sitting in the same place where Jim Behrle, Jordan Davis, Jean-Paul
Pecqueur, and Nathaniel Siegel have sat in years past). I've been sitting i=
n
the same section for the past nine, now 10, years--mezzanine, sec. 2 (behin=
d
home plate). I have two tickets for each game (prices below are per pair),
and they're under the overhang, so you don't get burned in the sun or wet i=
n
the rain.
=20
If you're interested in buying any tickets (or know someone who is) you can
email me here. (Note that the Mets charge different prices depending upon
the opponents and the date, so you'll see, for example, that the Brewers=B9
game costs less than the Diamondbacks=B9 game.)
=20
Hope this finds you well (and lets go Mets!)
=20
as ever,
David

Right. There have been some terrible incidents, but If I remember correctly, overall, the murder rates in European countries run about 1/3 of those in the US.

socialized medicine, which really does lower stress levels, and the
incarceration of a much smaller percentage of the population, a major
difference is that the crazies don't have automatic weapons (or guns

times. The mysteries of human motivation don't need to be solved to
change the gun laws.

 No, no. My questions were well intentioned: not satirical, nor rethorical,
no, no.
The case is that here in Portugal the legislation on gun posession is quite
restrictive.
Making it simple, the use of guns to the common citizens is limited to
hunting and sports and in well defined cases for security purposes like:
owning a jewelry and similar cases (in anycase there are procedings to meet
like medical (psichic) certificate, etc); but never ever allowed the use of
the so called "military" weapons.
I don't know if it is of any help but I can point you to the legislation
about this issue here (in portuguese, sorry) which is quite recent (Feb,
2006): http://www.psp.pt/psp/legislacao/Leis/L5_2006.pdf

Anyhow, a powerfull "gun business lobby" somebody refered to, doesn't exit
here.

Thank you for your time answering my questions.

PS: About the political side of the "thing" I could quote George Oppen, a
rather "not loved" american poet that once wrote in a letter,  about the
Vietname, something like: "people should march on Washigton and arrest the
president". I still believe in democracy, and I still believe that the
people have the power to change things.

I agree with Aryanil.  I think part of the problem is that a lot of people
disagree on how to interpret the second amendment to our constitution (the
first ten amendments are considered to be the most fundamental in terms of
basic rights).  It reads as follows:

"A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State,
the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed."

The gun-toting wingnuts (yeah, I'm a little biased here) interpret this to
mean that that people should experience no restrictions to buying any kind
of weaponry they want.  They experience any restriction as a violation of
this amendment, and then out come the waving flags.

The problem with this interpetation is that back when the amendment was
written, the United States didn't have a police force such as we have today,
and if people wanted to be protected, they had to organize their own
militias and work it out among themselves. The realities of life, what guns
were and what it meant to have a gun  were radically different back then.

They also didn't have handguns, saturday night specials, or automatic
weapons back then.  I also don't see how reasonable restrictions should be a
violation.  Plenty of people, myself included, feel that this amendment
simply does not adequately reflect modern day reality.

Here is a little something I am snippeting from Wikipedia, which covers it
all pretty exhaustively (
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution
):

The modern Second Amendment debate centers on questions such as:

   - Who does the Amendment mean by "the People"?
   - Why does the Amendment protect the right to 'keep *and* bear arms',
   and not protect just the right to 'bear arms'?
   - Does "bear arms" *or* "keep and bear arms" mean the same now as it
   did in 1789?
   - Is there significance that the Amendment is constructed of two
   clauses?
   - Is there significance that the phrase "defense of himself/themselves
   *and* the State" was included in some State Constitutions at the time
   but not included in the Federal Second Amendment?

In addition, the debate often involves discussion focused on more precise
details around the word "militia" from the first clause portion of the
Second Amendment, such as:

   - Who or what does the Amendment mean by the
"militia<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Militia_%28United_States%29>
   "?
   - What relationship does "militia" today have with "militia" in 1789?
   - What is meant by "well regulated", relative to "militia"?
   - Does the mention of "militia" in the Second Amendment mean that
   maintaining viable militia is the 'obvious purpose' of the Second Amendment?

It also often involves topics on differences in historical meanings and
thoughts such as:

   - What does "shall not be infringed" mean?

It also expands to include discussions on the impact among states, such as:

   - Does the Amendment prohibit States from regulating arms?
   - Does the Amendment permit some States to deviate from
   interpretations of the Amendment as taken by other States?

I hope this helps somewhat.

If the problem is in the "owners lobby", then you're facing a really huge
problem.
Just a thought: politicaly, I guess the voters (the votes lost) are not a
problem if all politic forces agreed to change the law. But/and then, the
power of the owners was an ARMY power not a democratic power. Hmmm,
frightening.

I believe not all politic forces agree on this. But for those who claim
security reasons for the current law, aren't they assuming their lack of
capacity to enforce security and order?? on a state level??

you mean aside from the odd pub or gov't building bombing here and there,
for, oh, the past 40 odd years, and a few riots?

seriously, it is the same young men, but they tend to act as individuals in
the US, which makes sense; but the whole amber alert and bomb security thing
was commonplace in London in the 80s

Poetry is Dangerous
Kazim Ali


On April 19, after a day of teaching classes at
Shippensburg University, I went out to my car and
grabbed a box of old poetry manuscripts from the front
seat of my little white beetle and carried it across
the street and put it next to the trashcan outside
Wright Hall. The poems were from poetry contests I had
been judging and the box was heavy. I had previously
left my recycling boxes there and they were always
picked up and taken away by the trash department.

A young man from ROTC was watching me as I got into my
car and drove away. I thought he was looking at my car
which has black flower decals and sometimes inspires
strange looks. I later discovered that I, in my dark
skin, am sometimes not even a person to the people who
look at me. Instead, in spite of my peacefulness, my
committed opposition to all aggression and war, I am a
threat by my very existence, a threat just living in
the world as a Muslim body.

Upon my departure, he called the local police
department and told them a man of Middle Eastern
descent driving a heavily decaled white beetle with
out of state plates and no campus parking sticker had
just placed a box next to the trash can.  My car has
NY plates, but he got the rest of it wrong. I have two
stickers on my car. One is my highly visible faculty
parking sticker and the other, which I just don't have
the heart to take off these days, says "Kerry/Edwards:
For a Stronger America."

Because of my recycling the bomb squad came, the state
police came. Because of my recycling buildings were
evacuated, classes were canceled, campus was closed.
No. Not because of my recycling. Because of my dark
body. No. Not because of my dark body. Because of his
fear. Because of the way he saw me. Because of the
culture of fear, mistrust, hatred, and suspicion that
is carefully cultivated in the media, by the
government, by people who claim to want to keep us
'safe.'

These are the days of orange alert, school lock-downs,
and endless war. We are preparing for it, training for
it, looking for it, and so of course, in the most
innocuous of places-a professor wanting to hurry home,
hefting his box of discarded poetry-we find it.

That man in the parking lot didn't even see me. He saw
my darkness. He saw my Middle Eastern descent. Ironic
because though my grandfathers came from Egypt, I am
Indian, a South Asian, and could never be mistaken for
a Middle Eastern man by anyone who'd ever met one.

One of my colleagues was in the gathering crowd,
trying to figure out what had happened. She heard my
description-a Middle Eastern man driving a white
beetle with out of state plates-and knew immediately
they were talking about me and realized that the box
must have been manuscripts I was discarding. She
approached them and told them I was a professor on the
faculty there. Immediately the campus police officer
said, "What country is he from?"

"What country is he from?!" she yelled, indignant.

"Ma'am, you are associated with the suspect. You need
to step away and lower your voice," he told her.

At some length several of my faculty colleagues were
able to get through to the police and get me on a cell
phone where I explained to the university president
and then to the state police that the box contained
old poetry manuscripts that needed to be recycled. The
police officer told me that in the current climate I
needed to be more careful about how I behaved. "When I
recycle?" I asked.

The university president appreciated my distress about
the situation but denied that the call had anything to
do with my race or ethnic background. The spokesperson
of the university called it an "honest mistake," not
referring to the young man from ROTC giving in to his
worst instincts and calling the police but referring
to me who made the mistake of being dark-skinned and
putting my recycling next to the trashcan.

The university's bizarrely minimal statement lets
everyone know that the "suspicious package" beside the
trashcan ended up being, indeed, trash. It goes on to
say, "We appreciate your cooperation during the
incident and remind everyone that safety is a joint
effort by all members of the campus community."

What does that community mean to me, a person who has
to walk by the ROTC offices every day on my way to my
own office just down the hall-who was watched, noted,
and reported, all in a day's work? Today we gave in
willingly and whole-heartedly to a culture of fear and
blaming and profiling. It is deemed perfectly
appropriate behavior to spy on one another and police
one another and report on one another. Such behaviors
exist most strongly in closed and undemocratic and
fascist societies.

The university report does not mention the root cause
of the alarm. That package became "suspicious" because
of who was holding it, who put it down, who drove
away. Me.

It was poetry, I kept insisting to the state policeman
who was questioning me on the phone. It was poetry I
was putting out to be recycled.

My body exists politically in a way I can not prevent.
For a moment today, without even knowing it, driving
away from campus in my little beetle, exhausted after
a day of teaching, listening to Justin Timberlake on
the radio, I ceased to be a person when a man I had
never met looked straight through me and saw the
violence in his own heart.

I have been discussing this sad and disturbing thing that has happened to
Kazim with a couple of other writers and we have decided to write letters
to the President of Shippensburg, William Ruud, encouraging him to speak
out more forcefully against this kind of fear-mongering. In Dr. Ruud's
statement regarding the VT shooting, he says:

"Here at Ship we consider ourselves to be a family, and it is important we
all look out for each other, just like you do for your own family... If
anyone has suggestions on ways to enhance safety or ways to communicate
better, please let me know."

This might be something to mention, if you feel inclined to write a letter
in support of Kazim.

As Jeff Davis says:

The situation he [Kazim] describes troubles me. His perspective I don't
think is schewed, unfair, or reactionary. I know Kazim. Not only is
Kazim's poetic sensitivity to nuance and sound among the finest I've
read in years; in my personal encounters with Kazim, he strikes me as
one of the most peaceful, non-violent people I know.

Kazim's situation with the police mirrors a sweeping trend in American
behavior especially among officials, university administrators, business
CEOs, and politicians: a pusillinamity that renders them without courage
or integrity to take responsibility or to speak honestly. Why? To play
it safe. To pretend that nothing's amiss. To avoid conflict. To avoid
truth.

evacuated, classes were canceled, campus was closed.
No. Not because of my recycling. Because of my dark
body. No. Not because of my dark body. Because of his
fear. Because of the way he saw me. Because of the
culture of fear, mistrust, hatred, and suspicion that
is carefully cultivated in the media, by the
government, by people who claim to want to keep us
'safe.'

These are the days of orange alert, school lock-downs,
and endless war. We are preparing for it, training for
it, looking for it, and so of course, in the most
innocuous of places-a professor wanting to hurry home,
hefting his box of discarded poetry-we find it.

That man in the parking lot didn't even see me. He saw
my darkness. He saw my Middle Eastern descent. Ironic
because though my grandfathers came from Egypt, I am
Indian, a South Asian, and could never be mistaken for
a Middle Eastern man by anyone who'd ever met one.

One of my colleagues was in the gathering crowd,
trying to figure out what had happened. She heard my
description-a Middle Eastern man driving a white
beetle with out of state plates-and knew immediately
they were talking about me and realized that the box
must have been manuscripts I was discarding. She
approached them and told them I was a professor on the
faculty there. Immediately the campus police officer
said, "What country is he from?"

"What country is he from?!" she yelled, indignant.

"Ma'am, you are associated with the suspect. You need
to step away and lower your voice," he told her.

At some length several of my faculty colleagues were
able to get through to the police and get me on a cell
phone where I explained to the university president
and then to the state police that the box contained
old poetry manuscripts that needed to be recycled. The
police officer told me that in the current climate I
needed to be more careful about how I behaved. "When I
recycle?" I asked.

The university president appreciated my distress about
the situation but denied that the call had anything to
do with my race or ethnic background. The spokesperson
of the university called it an "honest mistake," not
referring to the young man from ROTC giving in to his
worst instincts and calling the police but referring
to me who made the mistake of being dark-skinned and
putting my recycling next to the trashcan.

The university's bizarrely minimal statement lets
everyone know that the "suspicious package" beside the
trashcan ended up being, indeed, trash. It goes on to
say, "We appreciate your cooperation during the
incident and remind everyone that safety is a joint
effort by all members of the campus community."

What does that community mean to me, a person who has
to walk by the ROTC offices every day on my way to my
own office just down the hall-who was watched, noted,
and reported, all in a day's work? Today we gave in
willingly and whole-heartedly to a culture of fear and
blaming and profiling. It is deemed perfectly
appropriate behavior to spy on one another and police
one another and report on one another. Such behaviors
exist most strongly in closed and undemocratic and
fascist societies.

The university report does not mention the root cause
of the alarm. That package became "suspicious" because
of who was holding it, who put it down, who drove
away. Me.

It was poetry, I kept insisting to the state policeman
who was questioning me on the phone. It was poetry I
was putting out to be recycled.

My body exists politically in a way I can not prevent.
For a moment today, without even knowing it, driving
away from campus in my little beetle, exhausted after
a day of teaching, listening to Justin Timberlake on
the radio, I ceased to be a person when a man I had
never met looked straight through me and saw the
violence in his own heart.

pretty much all "american" (USA in origin) sports have violence built in as
a "controlled" measure of the game.  hockey, tho not of US origin,
incorporates violence as does soccer.  baseball does to an extent.  one
could argue that, esp for a sport like hockey, the violence is going to
happen.  making it "controlled" keeps it from boiling over.  of course, this
isn't a perfect method, we have seen what happens (todd bertuzzi).
basketball doesn't have a built in outlet--hence the incident at the palace,
tho i'd argue that ron artest is a pretty foul person to begin with, and
incited that.

in the sports-side of our culture, i feel americans are fairly honest and
the athletes/coaches/owners pretty transparent about the level of violence,
addressing it, etc.  i don't feel that we recognize fully yet the
super-saturation of violence.  it's so embedded...

Poetry is Dangerous
Kazim Ali


On April 19, after a day of teaching classes at
Shippensburg University, I went out to my car and
grabbed a box of old poetry manuscripts from the front
seat of my little white beetle and carried it across
the street and put it next to the trashcan outside
Wright Hall. The poems were from poetry contests I had
been judging and the box was heavy. I had previously
left my recycling boxes there and they were always
picked up and taken away by the trash department.

A young man from ROTC was watching me as I got into my
car and drove away. I thought he was looking at my car
which has black flower decals and sometimes inspires
strange looks. I later discovered that I, in my dark
skin, am sometimes not even a person to the people who
look at me. Instead, in spite of my peacefulness, my
committed opposition to all aggression and war, I am a
threat by my very existence, a threat just living in
the world as a Muslim body.

Upon my departure, he called the local police
department and told them a man of Middle Eastern
descent driving a heavily decaled white beetle with
out of state plates and no campus parking sticker had
just placed a box next to the trash can.  My car has
NY plates, but he got the rest of it wrong. I have two
stickers on my car. One is my highly visible faculty
parking sticker and the other, which I just don't have
the heart to take off these days, says "Kerry/Edwards:
For a Stronger America."

Because of my recycling the bomb squad came, the state
police came. Because of my recycling buildings were
evacuated, classes were canceled, campus was closed.
No. Not because of my recycling. Because of my dark
body. No. Not because of my dark body. Because of his
fear. Because of the way he saw me. Because of the
culture of fear, mistrust, hatred, and suspicion that
is carefully cultivated in the media, by the

and endless war. We are preparing for it, training for

After reading this I thought maybe one 'creative' response might be (for all
who want to) is to call the Department of Homeland Security every time one
of sees Cheney or Bush on television (they are rarely in the 'real' public).
Simply inform the officer on the duty that you have spotted a man carrying
and dumping out dangerous sounding speech. Don't give the officer any names,
just the name of the site (the White House, or military academy or training
grounds - as with most fascists, they can rarely appear anywhere else).
 And, in the interests of protecting the country, you would appreciate a
Department follow up on your suspicion.  And that if you are wrong, you are
sure that no harm will be done to the individuals that caused you this
concern.

Who's willing to go first??!!

i agree that the issue of pharmaceuticals is crucial here (Cho's
"farewell video," makes this pretty clear), and it seems like in this
era of posthumans bodies that we, teachers, ought to start getting
training in how to work with students who are
biologically-chemically-mechanically & socio-economically diverse. As
awesome as Nikki Giovanni is for standing up in this case and being
able to state clearly that something was 'off,' it seems like kicking
students out of classes (countries, hemispheres, or economic systems)
is part of the problem that leaves people with only these options of
turning to violence and/or suicide.

at least in my experience as long as class sizes are small enough, it
seems easy enough to spot students who are having bio-chemical-social
troubles--not from their writing but from the off comments that come
up in class or reactions to workshop or out-of-tunedness or strings of
absences--and it seems that students generally make some call for help
either through blatantly disruptive behavior or apologies or talk.

but then what? given the sometimes close connection between the health
and police systems in california and the quite severe consequences of
interacting with the police system it's hard know who to send students
to to get help

and who does eliminating students help, really?

my students at least--this seems to be a trend--need as much if not
more help with empathy and complex thinking than they do with craft.
i'm not sure that working with them in whitewashed little bubbles is
so helpful at all.

that isn't to say that anyone should allow bringing guns to class but
there are differences between what is unpleasant and uncomfortable and
disruptive and dangerous.

i'm remembering how hard i had to fight when i was young to get moved
from private to public schools were there was at least some
diversity--i had to bite a couple of principals in order to fight for
something well discussed already in the Powell opinion, section D of
in Bakke v. Regents of the University of California--diversity is
useful for everyone (& i think the principals ended up okay). & how
sweet of the state to offer to rescue me and siblings from our strange
non-suburband lives where people were coming in and out of life more
quickly than usual--

but also important not to be compelled--even then it was rather clear
that foster care would not take us to the suburbs and that suburbia
was no rescue at all-- see Marilyn Robinson's Housekeeping, among
other books.

& how frightening these car seat and helmet and seatbelt laws that
seem to stem from a similar "concern" but is more likely merely an
"interest" coupled wtih "compulsion"--see Heidegger, or for that
matter, Kant. and the strange little bubble of Safety that it tries to
make (see Janet Frame).

even though it looks like more work for us to learn how to work with
students whose body/mind situations & etc. fall out of the usual
efficiencies of standing at a blackboard, teaching craft, it seems
beneficial and quite rewarding work.

it takes a village & etc.

eireene

ps. do you guys remember, just after the twin towers fell, how
airlines stewardesses were being trained about what to do if a
terrorist was on their flight, and how quickly that training was
replaced by a designated gun-toting "flight marshall" who is supposed
to be responsible to taking out terrorists, but in what is mostly down
time also occupies himself with asking lots of people who come back
from Russia at least gruff questions as to the purpose of their visit
etc. I suppose we could have "classroom marshalls"--I confess, I still
haven't passed beyond my marital arts white belt and am uncertain how
to use a syringe, not that I would--but there are certain problems for
academic freedom given the mostly-down-time. has anyone been
reading/writing about these questions of "responsibility" in times of
terrorism? it isn't exactly the same when Cho states that he's copying
Jesus in his martyrdom as when there's a wider political concern but
it seems like the response & responsibility issues that come up in
both cases are quite similar.

Dear Mr President:


I'd just like you to know that in order to promote safety on campus
I have told all the dark-skinned Canadian poets I know not to try to
leave their
old poems at your university.


Helpfully--

Thanks for forwarding this. It is a sad and beautiful article.
As for poems written today, perhaps, sadness is the only virtue
of a beautiful poem.

Poetry is Dangerous
Kazim Ali


On April 19, after a day of teaching classes at
Shippensburg University, I went out to my car and
grabbed a box of old poetry manuscripts from the front
seat of my little white beetle and carried it across
the street and put it next to the trashcan outside
Wright Hall. The poems were from poetry contests I had
been judging and the box was heavy. I had previously
left my recycling boxes there and they were always
picked up and taken away by the trash department.

A young man from ROTC was watching me as I got into my
car and drove away. I thought he was looking at my car
which has black flower decals and sometimes inspires
strange looks. I later discovered that I, in my dark
skin, am sometimes not even a person to the people who
look at me. Instead, in spite of my peacefulness, my
committed opposition to all aggression and war, I am a
threat by my very existence, a threat just living in
the world as a Muslim body.

Upon my departure, he called the local police
department and told them a man of Middle Eastern
descent driving a heavily decaled white beetle with
out of state plates and no campus parking sticker had
just placed a box next to the trash can.  My car has
NY plates, but he got the rest of it wrong. I have two
stickers on my car. One is my highly visible faculty
parking sticker and the other, which I just don't have
the heart to take off these days, says "Kerry/Edwards:
For a Stronger America."

Because of my recycling the bomb squad came, the state
police came. Because of my recycling buildings were
evacuated, classes were canceled, campus was closed.
No. Not because of my recycling. Because of my dark
body. No. Not because of my dark body. Because of his
fear. Because of the way he saw me. Because of the
culture of fear, mistrust, hatred, and suspicion that
is carefully cultivated in the media, by the
government, by people who claim to want to keep us
'safe.'

These are the days of orange alert, school lock-downs,
and endless war. We are preparing for it, training for
it, looking for it, and so of course, in the most
innocuous of places-a professor wanting to hurry home,
hefting his box of discarded poetry-we find it.

That man in the parking lot didn't even see me. He saw
my darkness. He saw my Middle Eastern descent. Ironic
because though my grandfathers came from Egypt, I am
Indian, a South Asian, and could never be mistaken for
a Middle Eastern man by anyone who'd ever met one.

One of my colleagues was in the gathering crowd,
trying to figure out what had happened. She heard my
description-a Middle Eastern man driving a white
beetle with out of state plates-and knew immediately
they were talking about me and realized that the box
must have been manuscripts I was discarding. She
approached them and told them I was a professor on the
faculty there. Immediately the campus police officer
said, "What country is he from?"

"What country is he from?!" she yelled, indignant.

"Ma'am, you are associated with the suspect. You need
to step away and lower your voice," he told her.

At some length several of my faculty colleagues were
able to get through to the police and get me on a cell
phone where I explained to the university president
and then to the state police that the box contained
old poetry manuscripts that needed to be recycled. The
police officer told me that in the current climate I
needed to be more careful about how I behaved. "When I
recycle?" I asked.

The university president appreciated my distress about
the situation but denied that the call had anything to
do with my race or ethnic background. The spokesperson
of the university called it an "honest mistake," not
referring to the young man from ROTC giving in to his
worst instincts and calling the police but referring
to me who made the mistake of being dark-skinned and
putting my recycling next to the trashcan.

The university's bizarrely minimal statement lets
everyone know that the "suspicious package" beside the
trashcan ended up being, indeed, trash. It goes on to
say, "We appreciate your cooperation during the
incident and remind everyone that safety is a joint
effort by all members of the campus community."

What does that community mean to me, a person who has
to walk by the ROTC offices every day on my way to my
own office just down the hall-who was watched, noted,
and reported, all in a day's work? Today we gave in
willingly and whole-heartedly to a culture of fear and
blaming and profiling. It is deemed perfectly
appropriate behavior to spy on one another and police
one another and report on one another. Such behaviors
exist most strongly in closed and undemocratic and
fascist societies.

The university report does not mention the root cause
of the alarm. That package became "suspicious" because
of who was holding it, who put it down, who drove
away. Me.

It was poetry, I kept insisting to the state policeman
who was questioning me on the phone. It was poetry I
was putting out to be recycled.

My body exists politically in a way I can not prevent.
For a moment today, without even knowing it, driving
away from campus in my little beetle, exhausted after
a day of teaching, listening to Justin Timberlake on
the radio, I ceased to be a person when a man I had
never met looked straight through me and saw the
violence in his own heart.

That was extremely helpful, especially your explanation -
" The problem with this interpetation is that back when the amendment was
written, the United States didn't have a police force such as we have today,
and if people wanted to be protected, they had to organize their own
militias and work it out among themselves. The realities of life, what guns
were and what it meant to have a gun  were radically different back then."
gave my train of thought a new detour.

and thanks for the Wikipedia link.

I guess the early technologists and entrepreneurs of the gun industry might
have played their roles too. We didn't have police in India until
the late 18th century, needless to say, the notion came with the British.

I agree with Aryanil.  I think part of the problem is that a lot of people
disagree on how to interpret the second amendment to our constitution (the
first ten amendments are considered to be the most fundamental in terms of
basic rights).  It reads as follows:

"A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State,
the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed."

The gun-toting wingnuts (yeah, I'm a little biased here) interpret this to
mean that that people should experience no restrictions to buying any kind
of weaponry they want.  They experience any restriction as a violation of
this amendment, and then out come the waving flags.

The problem with this interpetation is that back when the amendment was
written, the United States didn't have a police force such as we have today,
and if people wanted to be protected, they had to organize their own
militias and work it out among themselves. The realities of life, what guns
were and what it meant to have a gun  were radically different back then.

They also didn't have handguns, saturday night specials, or automatic
weapons back then.  I also don't see how reasonable restrictions should be a
violation.  Plenty of people, myself included, feel that this amendment
simply does not adequately reflect modern day reality.

Here is a little something I am snippeting from Wikipedia, which covers it
all pretty exhaustively (
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitut
ion
):

The modern Second Amendment debate centers on questions such as:

   - Who does the Amendment mean by "the People"?
   - Why does the Amendment protect the right to 'keep *and* bear arms',
   and not protect just the right to 'bear arms'?
   - Does "bear arms" *or* "keep and bear arms" mean the same now as it
   did in 1789?
   - Is there significance that the Amendment is constructed of two
   clauses?
   - Is there significance that the phrase "defense of himself/themselves
   *and* the State" was included in some State Constitutions at the time
   but not included in the Federal Second Amendment?

In addition, the debate often involves discussion focused on more precise
details around the word "militia" from the first clause portion of the
Second Amendment, such as:

   - Who or what does the Amendment mean by the
"militia<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Militia_%28United_States%29>
   "?
   - What relationship does "militia" today have with "militia" in 1789?
   - What is meant by "well regulated", relative to "militia"?
   - Does the mention of "militia" in the Second Amendment mean that
   maintaining viable militia is the 'obvious purpose' of the Second
Amendment?

It also often involves topics on differences in historical meanings and
thoughts such as:

   - What does "shall not be infringed" mean?

It also expands to include discussions on the impact among states, such as:

   - Does the Amendment prohibit States from regulating arms?
   - Does the Amendment permit some States to deviate from
   interpretations of the Amendment as taken by other States?

I hope this helps somewhat.

I guess David's original question wasn't rhetorical at all, as he had
reinstated. My emphasis, on the other hand, admittedly, was a bit
rhetorical. But I had few facts on my side and need to educate myself
too.

About 10 years back, I (had just immigrated to the US then) watched
Charlton Heston on TV, speaking on behalf of the NRA in favor of the=20
gun lobby. MOSES FOR GUNS ! - I still can=92t forget my rather na=EFve
culture-shock.

Thanks for your great response. It was certainly educative.=20

Who funds/controls the NRA these days ?

Yes, it is a great question and it's one that many of us ask. Assuming =
you
are not asking this in a completely rhetorical manner, I will hazard an
answer that others may augment and/or correct.

The NRA (National Rifle Association, a powerful lobby with money to =
reward
those politicians who agree with it and tarnish and destroy those who =
oppose
it) says that universal access to firearms is a part of the U. S.
Constitution, through the 2nd amendment, I believe. The Constitution is =
a
living document, interpreted and reinterpreted nad very rarely amended =
(or,
as it happens, ignored and scorned and undermined by this =
administration).=20

Originally the idea was that citizens should be able to combat a militia =
of
tyrants, should the U. S. government become what the founders hoped =
they'd
left behind in Europe: religious zealots with militias, absolute =
monarchies,
etc. (i.e., fascists--we would now say).

I am assuming that your questions were sincere and not completely =
satirical,
though of course there is nothing funny about the anti-democratic,
unconstitutional administration under which we are living now--under an
executive branch that claims absolute power and exemption from the =
system of
checks and balances that is fundamental to the idea of democracy, that =
tries
to destroy the separation of church and state in the U.S., that ignores =
the
right to privacy, yet supports a "fundmamental" right of all citizens to =
get
hold of guns (including semi-automatic waepons) for any purpose, at any
time, with no waiting period and no background check (if the NRA has its
way, which it does in many states--and from those states, weapons flowly
easily across the U. S. and into the hands of people around the globe).

Worth remembering, as I think someone else on the list noted, that the
"weapons" the 2nd amendment was designed to consider were primarily =
MUSKETS
in rural settings in a country that was sparsely populated--not
semi-automatic weapons on college campuses, in Burgar Kings, in ghetto
neighborhoods, in schools.

I hope I have not been naive in taking your question too literally. On =
the
other hand, what the hell. Millions of people must wonder why this is
happening in America. Leaving aside all the extra cultural, macho, =
economic
factors, the U. S. Constitution as abused and misinterpreted by the NRA =
is
the reason for this nightmare.

I leave aside the way that the U. S. government has used weapons to =
subdue
and destroy internal populations of slaves from Africa and their
descendants, Native Americans, etc.
There never was any Constitutional provision allowing for that, and the =
most
vehement supporters of the National Rifle Association now would never =
have
supported the right of legitimately endangered people to bear arms =
against
the U. S. government and its sanctioned oppressors, including local =
police
departments, slaveholders, tribal chiefs,  etc.

I think it's a mistake to conflate violence with the physical nature of US
sports. Violence implies intent to do harm, which is not fundamental
to most sports.  For example, as an ex-American football player and current
American football coach, I can assure you I neither encourage my players
to nor acted in such a way as to harm another player.  Football is defined
by certain physical skill sets which include physicality or physicalness,
but not violence.  I understand many people involved with sports (coaches,
players, fans) make the same conflation, insisiting teams "kill the
opponent" or "win at all cost" and other ridiculous cliches.  Indeed, the
media glamorizes baseball's brawls, hockey's fights and the semi-recent
incident involving players and fans in the NBA.  The most violent sports, in
my opinion, are boxing (and it's various spin-offs like ultimate
fighting) and hockey, in which fighting/doing the opponent harm are parts of
the strategy, if not the essence, of the game.  Yet, neither of these sports
are American in origin.  The most ironic thing about those who conflate
sports' violence with physicality is their failure to respect opponents, and
this is a concept I stress to the young players I coach.  Without your
opponent, the sport or game you enjoy playing does not exist, or at least
not in its purest form.

I guess my main point is sports culture is not implicitly violent but
physical, which is part of the nature of sport, and yes, violent acts do
occur related to sports (using a hockey stick as a weapon, for example or an
angry parent who shoots a football coach for not playing his son, etc.).
Maybe we've reached the point where too few involved parties have the wisdom
to know the difference, and in my opinion, this is the problem, not the
nature of sports.

Best,
Steve Halle

       About a month a month ago I was working as usual on some of my rubBE=
ings--on the letterings on the tire of an immense crane by the site of some=
 apartment building swhich have been under construction for a little over a=
 year.         I was half bent over, my back facing outwards, face hidden a=
s close to the tire--to focuson my work--suddenly someone hit me with force=
 from behind on the left side and tried to pin me aginst the tire--yelling =
very loudly what are you going--i am calling the police!  And yelling for n=
eighbors, anyone to come--        I moved very slowly and turned to face a =
man shaking with rage and fear and trying to dial on his cell phone--and re=
ady to start screaming again at any moment--I remeined very clam and said d=
on't worry I am just working on some rubBeings--see--here is what I am doin=
g.        Fortunately the man stopped dialing and stared at the pieces of p=
aper.  I said if you will allow me to get them out of my bag I have some bo=
oks of these which have been published with my foto in them so you can see =
I am doing legal and legitimate art work.         The man in the end profus=
ely apologized and explained that from the back that I looked frightening--=
dressed all in black with a black hooded sweatshirt with hood up and bent o=
ver the machine as though applying something to the axle.  He didnt' really=
 want to say it--but he said I must know what he meant--      Two weeks ago=
 I was stopped for simply standing in an alley and looking at some boards. =
 I hd seen the police car pull up and park at the end of the alley but thou=
ght perhpas it was going to let officer out at the coffee shop at the corne=
r.  Instead he had pulled up behind me, with the car pressing me very close=
 to a dumpster and big beefy face with the aviator sun glasses staring at m=
e.  The usual questions until we got where I ilve--it is on my State non-dr=
iver's ID--the cop practically jumped inside his cab--what are you doing ov=
er here?--(I live on aanother side of town, in a very bad crack neighborhoo=
d--)--I explained I came there veryday for art work etc-etc--he ran the usu=
al check on the ID and then looking at me strted to ask me where I was from=
.  This is just a State ID he said--where are you from?  Milwaukee.  No no-=
-where are you from?  I was trying to stall him because of course all mylif=
e I have been arrested and detained in many countries and locked up--appear=
ed before a military tribunal in Poland after two weeks of house arrest--an=
d in the CRS political prisons in Paris---suspicion of false identiy, stole=
n passport, terrorism, even espionage--and ever since 9/11 since I no longe=
r have a passport my mother is worried al the time it will start happening =
here.  Already twice I had to be taken downtown for questioning about ident=
ity.  I asked them where they thought I was from--no answer--but it appeare=
d they didn't think an American.  Which for reasons I have never understood=
 or often even known--people often  don't think that I am an American here =
or abroad.  A mystery to me.            Fortunately as this cop began writi=
ng some things down and I had the sinking feeling we were headed downtwon y=
et again for me--a woman came running up yelling at the cop and chewing him=
 out, saying she knew who I was, all the neighbors do, and I am not doing a=
ny harm.      The cop was rather mortified by her outburst--and explained t=
ome that he was on the lookout for suspects in a string of burgalries inthe=
 area--and I had looked suspiciously like casing apartements as wlaking slo=
wly inthe alleys and checking out boards nd various pieces of brick and oth=
er surfaces.  The woman said--he uses that for art work--we see him all the=
 time.  The cop finally wrote some things down and then told me just not to=
 be seenn inthe alleys for a while.  You understand he said--your address i=
s a very bad one, and you are a person of indeterminate origin.         Las=
t week some friends asked me to wtach a man they thought supsicious intheir=
 store--I said I wil go out and smoke and watch throughthe window--but this=
 man is harmless--he is just alittle off--but harmless--I didnt know they h=
ad called the police--sure enough, the police arrive suddenly quite a few o=
f them in this nice neighborhood--and --going inside, thelast one in line s=
tops to question me.  I tried to explain I am just keeping an eye on this f=
ellow and I am sure he is harmless.  Just making the people inside nervous.=
  (Mainl becasue a loud mouthed customer kept claiming the man was staring =
at surveillance cameras.)          The cop was filling out my information a=
nd suddenly stopped and looked at me.  I know who you are he sys.  We had a=
 write up on you.  You're the person of uncertain origin.  But it says you =
seem to be okay with the neighbors.  So where are you from anyway?         =
   That's the most police contact I have had in quite a while--try to steer=
 clear of them becuase of the "uncertain origin"--what might happen to one?=
  Get put on a ghsot plane and be vanished to other side of the world?  Esp=
ecially if they really looked in my bag and found the various tools inside =
used for takeing things off of larger objects in dumpsters needed for art w=
ork--pliers, screw drivers, a small crow bar, a flash light and etc--a regu=
lar burgalr kit!--or perhaps in their eyes something far more insidious.   =
            Some thing I have thought about with the writing--is that the s=
hooter was such a silent man.  Often killers of this kind are very quiet pe=
ople--yet like to write--keep diaries--notes--make maps and the like.  Nowa=
days of course like the Colombine killers and the Virginia Tech young man--=
there is also video to use and other digtalized devices--cameras, recording=
s, etc--which were made into a multi-media presentation to send to the medi=
a--the Unabomber also wrote--sent his manifesto to the media--and in the fi=
lm Taxi Dri8ver, Travis' (Robert De Niro's) diary and the film itself are b=
ased on the diaries of Arthur Bremer, who stalked Nixon for months before h=
aving to shoot instead aless heavily guarded George Wallace--the diaries we=
re buried in Lake Park here in Milwaukee--(the assasination attempt on Theo=
dore Roosevelt when running as a Bull Moose candidate was here--)      What=
 intrigues me is that it is speaking which is used to get people to deal wi=
th their probelms and not writing--in Amger management for example--speakin=
g in a group with others with the same problems and rages and frutrations--=
is what helps people break down the sense of being isolated--to say things =
aloud to others--and to have them say similar things to you--in speaking, t=
he communication breaks down the control and isolation that writing can con=
fer--writing can make one feel more alone--or make one feel more omnipotent=
--more abject and silenced--or louder than anyone--until they reach for the=
 gun--the utlimate destination of the writing which is geared toweards a rh=
etoric of violence used to incite itself, to incite the writer--rather than=
 the reader--Though it is different, there is a relation--in Billy Budd--wh=
en Billy cannot speak--to Claggart--can't express himself--just stammers fu=
tiley--and Claggart is laughing at him as it were--Billy lashes out with hi=
s fists in place of the words he cannot form.> Date: Fri, 20 Apr 2007 14:41=

seriously, it is the same young men, but they tend to act as individuals in
the US, which makes sense; but the whole amber alert and bomb security thing
was commonplace in London in the 80s [Catherine Daly]

I'm not sure what this is meant to mean. At best, it's an unhelpful
caricature of US funded terrorism and its effects during the period you
refer to.

  Help Save Small Magazines

by Robert Mcchesney -

The news media are covering the tragic murders in Virginia this morning, and as they do an extraordinarily significant story is slipping through the cracks.

On very rare occasions I send a message to everyone in my email address book on an issue that I find of staggering importance and urgency. (My address book includes pretty much everyone who emails me in one form or another, and I apologize if you get this message more than once.) This is one of those times.

There is a major crisis in our media taking place right now; it is getting almost no attention and unless we act very soon the consequences for our society could well be disastrous. And it will only take place because it is being done without any public awareness or participation; it goes directly against the very foundations of freedom of the press in the entirety of American history.

The U.S. Post Office is in the process of implementing a radical reformulation of its rates for magazines, such that smaller periodicals will be hit with a much much larger increase than the largest magazines.

Because the Post Office is a monopoly, and because magazines must use it, the postal rates always have been skewed to make it cheaper for smaller publications to get launched and to survive. The whole idea has been to use the postal rates to keep publishing as competitive and wide open as possible. This bedrock principle was put in place by James Madison and Thomas Jefferson. They considered it mandatory to create the press system, the Fourth Estate necessary for self-government.

It was postal policy that converted the free press clause in the First Amendment from an abstract principle into a living breathing reality for Americans. And it has served that role throughout our history.

What the Post Office is now proposing goes directly against 215 years of postal policy. The Post Office is in the process of implementing a radical reformulation of its mailing rates for magazines. Under the plan, smaller periodicals will be hit with a much larger increase than the big magazines, as much as 30 percent. Some of the largest circulation magazines will face hikes of less than 10 percent.

The new rates, which go into effect on July 15, were developed with no public involvement or congressional oversight, and the increased costs could damage hundreds, even thousands, of smaller publications, possibly putting many out of business. This includes nearly every political journal in the nation. These are the magazines that often provide the most original journalism and analysis. These are the magazines that provide much of the content on Common Dreams. We desperately need them.

What the Post Office is planning to do now, in the dark of night, is implement a rate structure that gives the best prices to the biggest publishers, hence letting them lock in their market position and lessen the threat of any new competition. The new rates could make it almost impossible to launch a new magazine, unless it is spawned by a huge conglomerate.

Not surprisingly, the new scheme was drafted by Time Warner, the largest magazine publisher in the nation. All evidence available suggests the bureaucrats responsible have never considered the implications of their draconian reforms for small and independent publishers, or for citizens who depend upon a free press.

The corruption and sleaziness of this process is difficult to exaggerate. As one lawyer who works for a large magazine publisher admits, It takes a publishing company several hundred thousand dollars to even participate in these rate cases. Some large corporations spend millions to influence these rates. Little guys, and the general public who depend upon these magazines, are not at the table when the deal is being made.

The genius of the postal rate structure over the past 215 years was that it did not favor a particular viewpoint; it simply made it easier for smaller magazines to be launched and to survive. That is why the publications opposing the secretive Post Office rate hikes cross the political spectrum. This is not a left-wing issue or a right-wing issue, it is a democracy issue. And it is about having competitive media markets that benefit all Americans. This reform will have disastrous effects for all small and mid-sized publications, be they on politics, music, sports or gardening.

This process was conducted with such little publicity and pitched only at the dominant players that we only learned about it a few weeks ago and it is very late in the game. But there is something you can do. Please go to www.stoppostalrateh ikes.com and sign the letter to the Postal Board protesting the new rate system and demanding a congressional hearing before any radical changes are made. The deadline for comments is April 23.

I know many of you are connected to publications that go through the mail, or libraries and bookstores that pay for subscriptions to magazines and periodicals. If you fall in these categories, it is imperative you get everyone connected to your magazine or operation to go to www.stoppostalrateh ikes.com.

We do not have a moment to lose. If everyone who reads this email responds at www.stoppostalrateh ikes.com , and then sends it along to their friends urging them to do the same, we can win. If there is one thing we have learned at Free Press over the past few years, it is that if enough people raise hell, we can force politicians to do the right thing. This is a time for serious hell-raising.

And to my friends from outside the United States, I apologize for cluttering your inbox. If you read this far, we can use your moral support.



From the bottom of my heart, thanks.


Bob

interested in traveling beyond home!

Thank you for your encouragement and goodwill!

Brief description of the book:

Topographies chronicles the fictional legacies of descendants of
coal-miners in Logan, West Virginia.  This chronicle is not linear, but
rather episodic and spatial.  Time, here, is impressed, while experience
is expressed, yet each element pivots on the other.  The collection is
divided into four sequential categories, topographical markers, of poems
meant to be read individually, as part of the topographical sequence,
and as part of the larger collection.  Each page of the collection is
formatted in a kind of "postcard" landscape format, with margins running
8.5" wide and 5.5" long.  The poems should be read, in effect, as a
postcard book.

Reviews:

From Thylias Moss:

What strikes me about The Logan Topographies is how "the dream of a
belonging place" takes root and grows right along the surface of the
ground, forming what would look like the lifelines on a hand when seen
from above, but that is not the view that Alena Hairston wants for the
reader.  Instead, Alena Hairston places the reader on the ground, right
in the tracks of the roots as they progress horizontally, forming a map
of the intensity of feeling, the persistence of memory, and the impact
of both realized and unrealized dreams as they become part of what is
mined and unmined, the danger of collapse always imminent.  It is both
dangerous to dream and not to dream; the lives are such a part of the
land and the land is such a part of the lives that they become mirrors
-the land takes on the the structure and shape of the tracks of what was
lived in Logan, what was permitted, what was denied, what was hoped for
so intensely that the hope itself marked the land, engraving it with
longing both fulfilled partially and unfilled profoundly, leaving
beautiful cracks and designs that will always speak of possibility that
is destined to remain only possibility.   Yet possibility is what is
most needed.  Hairston is reading Logan's palm, the hand the people have
been dealt, the hand the people belong to and that also belongs to them.
The vigor with which these lines knit and hold this world is impressive,
and honest, and beautiful; fuel for the soul.

>On very rare occasions I send a message to everyone in my email address book on an issue that I find of staggering importance and urgency. (My address book includes pretty much everyone who emails me in one form or another, and I apologize if you get this message more than once.) This is one of those times.
>
>There is a major crisis in our media taking place right now; it is getting almost no attention and unless we act very soon the consequences for our society could well be disastrous. And it will only take place because it is being done without any public awareness or participation; it goes directly against the very foundations of freedom of the press in the entirety of American history.
>
>The U.S. Post Office is in the process of implementing a radical reformulation of its rates for magazines, such that smaller periodicals will be hit with a much much larger increase than the largest magazines.
>
>Because the Post Office is a monopoly, and because magazines must use it, the postal rates always have been skewed to make it cheaper for smaller publications to get launched and to survive. The whole idea has been to use the postal rates to keep publishing as competitive and wide open as possible. This bedrock principle was put in place by James Madison and Thomas Jefferson. They considered it mandatory to create the press system, the Fourth Estate necessary for self-government.
>
>It was postal policy that converted the free press clause in the First Amendment from an abstract principle into a living breathing reality for Americans. And it has served that role throughout our history.
>
>What the Post Office is now proposing goes directly against 215 years of postal policy. The Post Office is in the process of implementing a radical reformulation of its mailing rates for magazines. Under the plan, smaller periodicals will be hit with a much larger increase than the big magazines, as much as 30 percent. Some of the largest circulation magazines will face hikes of less than 10 percent.
>
>The new rates, which go into effect on July 15, were developed with no public involvement or congressional oversight, and the increased costs could damage hundreds, even thousands, of smaller publications, possibly putting many out of business. This includes nearly every political journal in the nation. These are the magazines that often provide the most original journalism and analysis. These are the magazines that provide much of the content on Common Dreams. We desperately need them.
>
>What the Post Office is planning to do now, in the dark of night, is implement a rate structure that gives the best prices to the biggest publishers, hence letting them lock in their market position and lessen the threat of any new competition. The new rates could make it almost impossible to launch a new magazine, unless it is spawned by a huge conglomerate.
>
>Not surprisingly, the new scheme was drafted by Time Warner, the largest magazine publisher in the nation. All evidence available suggests the bureaucrats responsible have never considered the implications of their draconian reforms for small and independent publishers, or for citizens who depend upon a free press.
>
>The corruption and sleaziness of this process is difficult to exaggerate. As one lawyer who works for a large magazine publisher admits, It takes a publishing company several hundred thousand dollars to even participate in these rate cases. Some large corporations spend millions to influence these rates. Little guys, and the general public who depend upon these magazines, are not at the table when the deal is being made.
>
>The genius of the postal rate structure over the past 215 years was that it did not favor a particular viewpoint; it simply made it easier for smaller magazines to be launched and to survive. That is why the publications opposing the secretive Post Office rate hikes cross the political spectrum. This is not a left-wing issue or a right-wing issue, it is a democracy issue. And it is about having competitive media markets that benefit all Americans. This reform will have disastrous effects for all small and mid-sized publications, be they on politics, music, sports or gardening.
>
>This process was conducted with such little publicity and pitched only at the dominant players that we only learned about it a few weeks ago and it is very late in the game. But there is something you can do. Please go to www.stoppostalrateh ikes.com and sign the letter to the Postal Board protesting the new rate system and demanding a congressional hearing before any radical changes are made. The deadline for comments is April 23.
>
>I know many of you are connected to publications that go through the mail, or libraries and bookstores that pay for subscriptions to magazines and periodicals. If you fall in these categories, it is imperative you get everyone connected to your magazine or operation to go to www.stoppostalrateh ikes.com.
>
>We do not have a moment to lose. If everyone who reads this email responds at www.stoppostalrateh ikes.com , and then sends it along to their friends urging them to do the same, we can win. If there is one thing we have learned at Free Press over the past few years, it is that if enough people raise hell, we can force politicians to do the right thing.

2. Posting to the List
       The Poetics List is a moderated list. All messages          are reviewed by the editors in keeping with the goals of the list as articulated          in this Welcome Message (see section 1).
       Please note that while this list is primarily concerned          with discussions of poetry and poetics, messages relating to politics          and political activism, film, art, media, and so forth are also welcome.          We strongly encourage subscribers to post information, including web links,          relating to publications (print and internet), reading series, and blogs          that they have coordinated, edited, published, or in which they appear.          Such announcements constitute a core function of this list. Brief reviews          of poetry events and publications (print or digital) are always welcome.
       We generally do not accept postings of creative work not directed toward a discussion of poetics issues on the list. The Poetics List is not a venue for the posting of free-standing, personal poems or journal entries. However, the Poetics List editor may occasionally solicit or approve poems for posting on the list.
 Also, please note that the Poetics List is not a "chat" list and we discourage the posting of  very short messages intended for only a few subscribers.

  All posts go out not only to list subscribers but also become a public part of the list archive on the web. Note that posting to the list is a form of publication and that by sending your message to the list you formally consent to such web publication. Posts are currently being indexed by search engines such as Google. It is not possible for us to remove posts from the list archive or to control search engine indexing of these posts.
 Subscribers only may post to the Poetics List.          Send messages directly to the list address: poetics@listserv.buffalo.edu.

Hi David, thanks for posting this piece its a fascinating read. I often end
up speaking to =8Cauthorities=B9 when i am out looking for material. This time =
i
found some great material!;

Police Brutality and Art Criticism in the 21st Century

I was at the train station in amsterdam with a friend, and we ate sandwiche=
s
with pickles on them. So here we were walking out of the Central Station an=
d
there was one of those Entry Prohibited signs, those blue ones that list th=
e
rules on the construction site at the front of the station.

so I place a pickle over the eye of the picture of the guy wearing a hard
hat helmet, two pickles in fact, one over each eye. I was with a friend,
both of us in our mid-thirties, two grown men for a night on the town. I
hear an =B3Ahem=B2 behind me & there=B9s two policemen, well police-kids actually=
,
fresh out of cop-school. White guy and a black guy, and there=B9s me and my
friend; a white guy and a black guy. So anyway the white cop says (in dutch
this all transpires) something like =B3you better remove that pickle now=B2. I
say something like =B3are you kidding =AD why could you possibly care?=B2 to whic=
h
I get a response that is quite scary for its fastidiousness =AD I get a speec=
h
on the basic tenets of capitalism =AD that its private business property &
that it should be respected and how would i like it if my business property
were vandalised?
=20
Vandalised =AD did I also mention that it was raining and the pickles would b=
e
washed away in a few minutes? ok, well anyway, I tell him that i don=B9t agre=
e
and that it=B9s a really his opinion based on his social conditioning & he
starts in telling me its unhygenic and disgusting. By now the two black men
are thoroughly uncomfortable and bored with the white men. I ask the child,
for he really is a child, pointing to the building where the Modern Art
Museum is housed, I ask him if he=B9s ever been to the museum, he shakes his
head, i tell him he could find all sorts of things like pickles on signs
there, banana smeared on portraits of the queen, things like that. He asks
me if i want to pay a fine or go to the police station. So much for art
criticism in the 21st century.

Hello all,

If you didnt read the below two posts, please consider reading them.
They are worthy, in more than one way.

They are worthy as stories that will grasp your attention , for good
reason, but also as a reminder of the US's / world's direction away
from "freedom for humanity".

"Freedom", meaning, why is an opinion not tolerated, not allowed to be
freely expressed and/or exercised.

"Humanity", meaning, at what point in time did it become okay for a
person to not be treated as an individual.

In the late 90s, I worked with Mass State Police and
Governor Weld's office to do the kind of building that
would lead to such things being made possible (as did
many of us from varied backgrounds) -- a kinder, more
considerate world. Maybe things are getting better.?

By GARANCE BURKE, Associated Press Writer
Sat Apr 21, 1:22 AM ET

FRESNO, Calif. - When school officials announce the
name of the Fresno High School prom king on Saturday,
Cinthia Covarrubias will be wearing a tuxedo just like
the six boys vying for the honor. Administrators
agreed to reverse a district protocol this week that
limited males to compete for the title after
Covarrubias was nominated by her classmates.

"I would never have run for anything if I had to wear
a dress," said Covarrubias, who considers herself
transgender, an umbrella term that covers all people
whose outward appearance and internal identity don't
match their gender at birth.

Gay youth advocates called it a landmark victory for
campus gender expression and said they believe it's
the first time in the U.S. that an openly transgender
student has run for prom royalty.

"We are growing as a society to accept much more
diversity in gender expression, and that's a positive
thing," said Carolyn Laub, director of the
Gay-Straight Alliance Network.

Covarrubias, who wears black-and-white Vans, baggy
shorts and close-cropped brown hair, sometimes
identifies herself as Tony. Her date, a close female
friend, plans to wear a black dress and red corsage to
the prom at an outdoor reception hall surrounded by
man-made waterfalls.

On Wednesday, officials at the school of 2,700
students shifted course, saying the district's lawyers
had recommended adding Covarrubias' name to the ballot
to comply with a 2000 state law protecting students'
ability to express their gender identity on campus.

"We always want to do the right thing by our
students," Vice Principal Sheila Uriarte said. "This
is why we came to this decision."

Leanne Reyes, 16, said Covarrubias had her vote.

"It's not like the stereotype where the king has to be
a jock and he's there with the cheerleaders anymore,"
said Reyes, a senior. "We live in a generation now
where dudes are chicks and chicks are dudes."

Still, some students criticized the decision to put
Covarrubias on the ballot.

"I like lesbians, but they shouldn't be allowed to run
for king," said senior Erich Logan, 18, as he stood
outside the stately high school building.

A native of Jalisco, Mexico, Covarrubias said she has
bucked rigid expectations of how a girl in her culture
should behave. Explaining the meaning of terms like
"queer" and "transgender" to her parents and eight
siblings has at times been painful, she said.

"My freshman year I just started feeling different,"
she said. "When I decided to change to be like this,
all of a sudden I said, 'Wow, I feel OK. I feel like
finally I'm being me.'"

She has no current plans, however, to permanently
alter her gender through hormones or surgery.

Tiffani Sanchez, a science teacher who advises the
school's Gay-Straight Alliance, said the decision
would foster understanding of the broad spectrum of
gender identities.

"Cinthia is still really learning who she is," she
said. "We want her to know that there's a safe space
for her here and we support her."

Covarrubias is giddily looking forward to the prom,
but acknowledged being a little nervous.

"I'm happy I actually made a difference about changing
the law and the policy so you can run for your
choice," Covarrubias said.

The unfounded rumor that Giovanni was paid a million dollars to go to South Africa was just that--a rumor. The plane she was on made a layover stop there.

As for her violent poetry, that was written at the height of the Black Arts movement, and it was hardly unusual for the day, as I'm sure everyone is aware of (hence the Baraka reference).It has long been suggested that the men of the Black Arts Movement clashed with Giovanni (and vice versa) because of her Womanist concerns, and her refusal to tow the line of the increasingly militiant Black Power Movement.

I know this is totatlly irrelevant to the VA Tech shooting spree, but I felt compelled to respond to the resurfacing of an old and long-discredited rumor.




--------
And a footnote on Nikki Giovanni: a few decades back, before she became a distinguished professor of creative writing, she wrote a poem called, if memory serves: "nigger can you kill," in which the "interpellated subject" is interrogated as to his/her capacity to kill several allegedly deserving targets, including "a jew."  Several years later, though, she took a trip to apartheid South Africa while a boycott was on!!  (Baraka, himself no stranger to rhetorical violence, called her on that in no uncertain terms -- not one of his more fortunate poetic polemics, either; it was entitled "Niggy the Ho" and went downhill from there.)

I am working on reading throughout America, and the rest of the world but so far I am stuck in North America. This is not a bad thing, as an American with a substantial American heritage I would love to read all of the Americas. I have a gazillion chaps of poetry, a book of non-fiction and (intentionally) no book of poetry tho twenty plus years in the craft.

  Let me know your best offer, I can also talk about running a small press that has put out an unreasonable number of titles including some poetry bestsellers if it makes a difference. I can address arts administration and grant writing as well. I will be reading in NYC, Detroit, South Dakota, North Dakota, New Mexico and San Francisco in the US, as well as Mexico City and Toronto.  And I can always use more readings in these areas but also I am open to all offers, send me your offers. I have a need to travel after so long of being in one place.

  If not I will appear in your city anyways, I am like that, expect it. But to mention some fairly local places I would like to appear in: Philly, DC, Seattle, Chicago, Boston, Buffalo, Syracuse, Penn State, Bucknell, Pittsburgh, Baltimore, but have been to lazy to really set anything up, I really need a promo person, but part of me thinks while calling up a band who is touring these areas as would be familiar to me would be easier and pay better, but please prove me wrong as touring with a band has a tendency to create its own problems. I have regularly talked to a group that is known as the "Greatest rock and roll band in the World" (do a websearch) but unfortunately they are overseas currently and that has presented its own difficulties, so lets bounce.

  So anyway, all offers, there are many national positions I am being considered for as an arts executive / administrator currently so I would enjoy visiting your city.  I do have a (rent covering) minimum but I will work with you. Call me 614-445-0534. Love --d

  as usual I like what you have to say, this eve I am coming back from having hear Ken Rumble read in a most odd setting that I most totally appreciated, a suburban reading in Columbus that I drove a half hour to in Worthington that seemed fittting for his ovuere and for yours I would have you read in. how bout you and I have you down I mean how much is a bus? One of authors picked up an agent as happens and they have been commissioned to write a book about the punk scene in the US and who knows why Random House thinks that is marketable but it is $. I was thining maybe you would know to refer her to. What do I know but that I need to buy you some art supplies so figure out a way to get me to milwaukee or you here so I can do it. At the very least the biggest lumber pencil possible. You know I am serious as cancer.

  By the way, George Bowering, even after all these years of sparring, after that last post it is still apparent that you still got it. Props to you. How about you read for me too. I am against the Indians, still offended at Chief Wahoo after a decade of residence, but maybe we could go to a Reds game. Let me know.

  ---------------
  Dear Mr President:


I'd just like you to know that in order to promote safety on campus
I have told all the dark-skinned Canadian poets I know not to try to
leave their old poems at your university.


Helpfully--
George Bowering


Be well

Subject:      My stupid talking.
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII; format=flowed

My stupid talking.

When I speak I sound like an idiot. I can't control my words. Thoughts and
concepts fluster in and out, a jumble. When I write, things are different;
they organize themselves, I am a shepherd. My thinking wears my writing.
Words and worlds organize. Work is words. When I speak, things pour forth,
uselessly. When I write a letter or email, I continue speaking. The style,
content, is absurd, monstrous. No one keeps my email. I am constantly
losing posts. There's no reason to keep them; they're incorrect. When I
reply online to someone, it's the same thing, ridiculous. I lose track of
my emotions, of what I'm saying. I appear stupid. Only when I am writing,
like this, through the interior of what might have been my speech - only
when I am writing _thus,_ am I satisfied. My words connect; the thought is
often brilliant, almost always dense, compact, to the point. Speaking, I
can't even defend myself. I am not the other of the signifier I need to be
in order to be. If my speaking is becoming, my writing is ontology itself.
When I speak, it's strategy, joking. People are surprised at my sense of
humor. It's a carapace I wear with delight. It keeps me from death. Death
seeps through my writing. Death inhabits my writing; my writing inhabits
death. I do not draw a distinction; I write only within the written. When
I speak, language disappears into melody. There is a difficulty with
melody just as there is a difficulty with cleverness. Cleverness is a
proper turn-away from truth towards communality. I speak with cleverness.
It comes from the situation of speaking. I write from somewhere else. In
my writing cleverness sounds a false note. It indicates I am off track, I
have lost myself, I am suturing over the wound of ignorance and existence.
There is no laughter in my writing. There is laughter in my letters and
email. They are absurd as my laughter is absurd. They attempt to cover my
inadequacy. My absurd joking deflects my graceless awkwardness. It goes
nowhere, says nothing of any consequence, and says it poorly. I think my
speaking and email will be the death of me. They draw attention way from
my writing. They undermine it. They say it's not clever enough, intelli-
gent enough. My writing does not respond. My writing sinks, and is writing
about that sinking. My writing props up my world it undermines and
describes. My talking ignores the whole problem. My talking is that litany
of deflections. What I do not understand, I turn into something else. What
I do understand becomes fodder; it never nourishes sufficiently. My talk-
ing implies talking to another limit; there's no etiquette in this. There
is no community in my writing; community cannot survive honesty. But my
writing is full of subterfuge, is about that subterfuge. My talking
carries itself everywhere in order to become pointless. My talking is
pointless. My writing is chiseled into a simulacrum construct of the real.
The real in my writing has everything at stake. It is at stake through and
within the writing. My speaking ignores the real; what is at stake is my
self and its alterity. My self is always in the midst-of, when I am speak-
ing. My self is absent or boundary, bordering, when I am writing. I write
beyond myself; I speak from myself. My speaking is monstrous, self-defeat-
ing. My writing is after the fact. If my speaking is central, my writing
is peripheral; if my writing is central, my speaking is peripheral. One
must read my writing, read my writing with the utmost care. One must never
listen when I am speaking.

        from "Self-Help"

        Lake Tang Woo Chin Chicken with Lobster and Sweet Clam Sauce still
not served and everyone
        else got their orders twenty minutes back.—Savor the water, feast on
the company.

        Subway floods and late for audition.—Start being the author of your
own performance. Take a
        walk.

        Slip on ice, break arm.—In moments like this, the preciousness of
life reveals itself.

        Wages down in non-union shop.—You're a sales associate, not a
worker; so proud to be part of
        the company.

        Miss the train?--Great chance to explore the station!

        Suicide bombers wreck neighborhood—Time to pitch in!

        Nothing doing.—Take a break!

        Partner in life finds another partner.—Now you can begin the journey
of life anew.

        Bald?--Finally, you can touch the sky with the top of your head.

        Short-term recall shot.—Old memories are sweetest

        Hard drive crashes and novel not backed up.—Nothing like a fresh
start.

        Severe stomach cramps all morning.—Boy are these back issues of
Field and Stream engrossing.

        Hurricane crushes house.—You never seemed so resilient.

Tenney Nathanson  is the author of the book-length poem Home on the Range
(The Night  Sky with Stars in My Mouth) (O Books, 2005) and the collection

Meditations in a Time of Delusions and Lies 21: Honor the English Departmen=
t
at Virginia Tech
=20
Hilton Obenzinger
=20
April 22, 2007
------------------
=20
While people are puzzling over the grotesque slaughter at Virginia Tech, I=92=
d
like to note one aspect of the horror.  Lucinda Roy and Nikki Giovanni, his
creative writing teachers, and others in the English department comprehende=
d
Seung-hui Cho=92s words and observed his strange behavior, and they responded=
.
In the end, Cho engineered a vast, multifaceted performance: theatrically
committing the murders, inscribing a lengthy rant or manifesto, performing
video testimony, mugging for photographs, and writing two scripts and
probably other pieces before the murders.  Even his unnerving silence as
described by his roommates and fellow students constituted a kind of
performance.  All together, it constituted a creative project of sorts =96
albeit a twisted, demented, diabolical one.
=20
Some may blame the English department at Virginia Tech for allowing Cho=92s
imagination to flourish.  There have been those suspicious of poetry and th=
e
creative arts because of their purported corrupting influence since at leas=
t
Plato.  In the early nineteenth century, American preachers inveighed
against women reading sentimental novels because the romances depicted may
lead to their seduction; later in the century, protectors of civic virtue
raised alarms against young men reading dime novels and =93bad boy=94 books
(like Adventures of Huckleberry Finn and Peck=92s Bad Boy) because their
irreverence and violence may cause boys to commit crimes or violate the
norms of proper middle-class behavior.  Worry about the influence of
violence on TV, film, music, and video games is not new.  There=92s a lot to
discuss about the nature of popular culture, in particular.  Truly, the
workings of our imaginations can be vile and can be shaped by the crude
imaginations of others =96 but we=92ve known this for centuries.  I=92m worried
that if we put a lid on our thoughts, we may miss too much that is good, an=
d
the lid may blow off anyway.
=20
Some people may slight the fact that Cho=92s English teachers did detect his
anguish, anger, and derangement precisely because of his attempts at
imaginative production.  But these teachers could tell that, for this
strange kid, the boundaries of imagination and reality were dangerously
close to being crossed.  And they acted upon what they saw and read.  Nikki
Giovanni ejected him from her classroom =96 noting his anger and the negative
effect on other students =96 and Lucinda Roy took him out of her classroom in
order to tutor him individually.  Teachers in the English department
consulted with each other over his writings and his behavior.  They advised
him to seek counseling, and they alerted everyone they should have,
including campus security, to the danger he posed.
=20
The fact that the university=92s responses were not as effective as anyone
would have wished is another matter: there are a lot of questions of how
colleges are supposed to intervene in such situations, and of how to manage
the relationship between individual autonomy and communal safety.  Many wil=
l
seek someone to blame, when there may be no one, except perhaps the bizarre
intoxication with violence our society seems to enjoy.
=20
But one thing needs to be pointed out: the English department should be
honored, as well as the role of reading and writing literature in our
schools and the cultivation of culture more generally.
=20
I teach literature and writing at a university, so I=92m biased =96 but I do
hear things.  I hear from students and those beyond the university that
there=92s something =93fuzzy=94 or unnecessary or even silly about studying
literature when someone could study palpable things like engineering or
biology or international relations.  Novels and poems and other imaginative
works are not utilitarian, most of the time, but they serve our souls
nonetheless.  We can enter the minds of Raskolnikov and Ahab, we can
experience the power of language to create realities, we can wonder how
people are the way they are, and we can be moved and awaken and change, and
even societies can change in response.  Writing is not necessarily
confessional or cathartic, but it does allow a way to reveal ourselves, eve=
n
to become ourselves more fully, and to engage the world through our thought=
s
and dreams, and it does demand responses from readers, even if the writer i=
s
sullen and withdrawn.
=20
Consider all the people who could have gone off the deep end except that
they read a novel or wrote a poem instead, and as a result they found a pat=
h
to life instead.
=20
So I=92d like to salute the Virginia Tech English department.  They perceived
the danger, they reached out to a tortured young man with courage, they
rejected his evil, and they alerted all that they could.
=20
All colleges should have English teachers who can do so much.

In Baghdad, there's a wall being built by the U. S. Military to surround =
the Adhamiya
neighborhood, a Sunni Arab enclave bordered by Shiite areas... Reminding =
me of
other walls-- making me think:

The Iraq question is open as long as this wall is in place;

making me think:

Es gibt bur ein Baghdad;

making me think:

making me think:

Mr. President, if you seek peace, if you seek prosperity for Iraq... and =
all the region,
if you seek liberalization, Come here to this wall! Mr. President, open =
this gated community!
Mr. President, tear down this wall!

It is a balm that such ghosts can be
found everywhere! Thanks for their

Also, hoping that you can record
the Manhattan walks and events
for the blog for those of us who
can't make it. I for one would
enjoy walking along that document.

Just thought I'd share the following story announcing that Washington state now has a poet laureate position. Other stories have been appearing in the Seattle Times and other state newspapers. The Washington Poets Association (www.washingtonpoets.org) has been lobbying for a state poet laureate for a decade, and finally made it happen, in conjunction with the state Arts Commission and other interested parties. Previously, 40 other states already had poets laureate, and the new Washington state position will be dedicated to promoting a literacy and a full range of poetry appreciation throughout the state.

P.S. The WPA's annual Burning Word poetry festival (which attracted 400+ people last year) will be held this coming weekend, on April 28. It features Naomi Shihab Nye and George Bowering, among many others, as well as U.S. children's poet laureate Jack Prelutsky, who will receive the WPA's Lifetime Achievement Award.

YAKIMA HERALD-REPUBLIC

Gov. Chris Gregoire has signed into law a bill that promotes poetry
over politics.

House Bill 1279, which the governor signed Thursday afternoon in
Olympia, establishes Washington's first official poet laureate program
to promote reading, poetry and literature in classrooms across the
state.

The bill, introduced by Rep. Mary Skinner, R-Yakima, and promoted by
retired Yakima Herald-Republic reporter Ed Stover, provides an initial
stipend of $30,000 for the 2007-09 biennium.

"It's very exciting," Stover said. "Poetry is one of the primary tools
for teaching literacy to kids ... it's a wonderful tool for improving
all of your language skills in terms of word choice and vocabulary, and
makes learning a lot more fun."

During Thursday's ceremony, Skinner held a poem she'd asked Stover to
write for the occasion.

"A poet laureate would be the state's official spokesperson in verse,"
Skinner said in a news release.

"The legislation notes the importance of the arts and education in
Washington, particularly through reading and writing of verse. It would
help us promote literacy and provide a creative outlet for people,
especially students, to express themselves," she said.

After a decade of unsuccessfully pushing for the poet laureate
position, backers of the plan celebrated earlier this month when the
Senate passed the bill and sent it to the governor.

Besides being a published poet, Stover said, the state's poet laureate
must also have teaching skills and be a Washington state resident. The
Washington State Arts Commission will establish the poet laureate
program and recommend someone for the two-year term of office.

Like many on this list, I'm sure, I've tried to make the same points to my students when I do get a chance to teach poetry (which isn't often). Thanks Tom.

Ren,

I think Amalio Madueno in Taos had responded to my original post (on content) a few days after it first appeared  here. As for the scenario you describe, it sounds (content-wise) very slam-like. I think when people do long introductions to poems it is a sign they've not written it well, but there are manyh exceptions.

Of course context has a lot to do with our enjoyment of a poem, set & setting, eh? How we can relate, if there is a way in for the listener/reader.

I am wondering what's wrong with my email, I got the following non-sequitor:


Subject: Cho's Martyrdom Bagdad's Grief

Imagine Cho's Virginia Tech martyrdom continuing day
after day after day throughout the US for four years.
Thus one might imagine Bagdad's grief and the enormity
of the American transgression in Iraq.

But I can't find the context for Paul's original posting.
I think his question about content in poetry is interesting. Not as a direct
response, but in the same vein: last week I heard a poetry reading and one
of the women introduced her work with a long presentation of her problems
dealing with her incest issues and how difficult her relationships were with
her mother and sister etc. etc. She spoke for about 5 or 6 minutes before
reading her poem. When she was finished two people in the audience stood and
applauded and whistled. So, my question is how often context plays a role in
poetry? Is that valid in terms of evaluating quality?

In fact, here it predictably goes - Yale bans fake swords on stage in
response to Virginia Tech massacre! A totally insane response, which seems
to be more about making sure art behaves itself than anything else. From
Yale Daily News http://www.yaledailynews.com/articles/view/20843

In the wake of Monday's massacre at Virginia Tech in which a student killed
32 people, Dean of Student Affairs Betty Trachtenberg has limited the use o=
f
stage weapons in theatrical productions.

Students involved in this weekend's production of "Red Noses" said they
first learned of the new rules on Thursday morning, the same day the show
was slated to open. They were subsequently forced to alter many of the
scenes by swapping more realistic-looking stage swords for wooden ones, a
change that many students said was neither a necessary nor a useful respons=
e
to the tragedy at Virginia Tech.

According to students involved in the production, Trachtenberg has banned
the use of some stage weapons in all of the University's theatrical
productions. While shows will be permitted to use obviously fake plastic
weapons, students said, those that hoped to stage more realistic scenes of
stage violence have had to make changes to their props.

Trachtenberg could not be reached for comment Thursday night.

"Red Noses" director Sarah Holdren '08 said she first heard about the
changes in a phone call from a friend as she arrived at the Off-Broadway
Theater on Thursday morning. At the theater, technical director Jim
Brewczynski told her about the new regulations. The pair then met with
Trachtenberg, who initially wanted no stage weapons to be used in the show,
Holdren said, though she later agreed to permit the use of obviously fake
weapons.

In a speech made before last night's opening show of "Red Noses," Holdren
said that Trachtenberg's decision to force the production to use wooden
swords instead of metal swords will do little to stem violence in the world=
.


"Calling for an end to violence onstage does not solve the world's
suffering: It merely sweeps it under the rug, turning theater =97 in the wo=
rds
of this very play =97 into 'creamy bon-bons' instead of 'solid fare' for a
thinking, feeling audience," she said. "Here at Yale, sensitivity and
political correctness have become censorship in this time of vital need for
serious artistic expression."

Holdren said she is primarily worried about the University's decision to
place limitations on art, rather than the specific inconvenience to her
production.

"I completely understand that the University needs to respond to the
tragedy, but I think it is wrong to conflate sensitivity and censorship,"
she said in an interview. "It is wrong to assume that any theater that deal=
s
with tragic matter is sort of on the side of those things or out to get
people; they're not =97 they're out to help people through things like this=
. I
want my show and all shows to be uplifting to people. That's why I'm upset
about this =97 it's not because my props were taken =97 it's about imposing
petty restrictions on art as the right way to solve the problems in the
world."

Brandon Berger '10, who plays a swordsman in the show, said the switch to a=
n
obviously fake wooden sword has changed the nature of his part from an
"evil, errant knight to a petulant child."

"They're trying to make an appropriate gesture, but they did it in an
inappropriate way =97 they've neutered the play," he said. "The violence is
important to what it actually means. What these types of actions do is very
central =97 it is not gratuitous."

Susie Kemple '08, an actress in the show, said Trachtenberg's way of dealin=
g
with the Virginia Tech massacre was not beneficial to the students' own
mourning process.

"It is problematic because all of us were incredibly shocked by the events
at Virginia Tech," Kemple said. "We turn to extracurriculars in our grief
[and] the Yale administration makes the healing more difficult. None of the
shows are about massive gun violence =97 this show is about showing and
explaining the human experience."

Berger also said he finds the ruling inconsistent because forms of stage
violence that do not involve weapons =97 such as hangings =97 are still
permitted.

"Red Noses" will end its run Saturday night.

I'm so thrilled to announce my first book, Derivative of the Moving Image,
from the University of New Mexico Press. The book is in the catalog on their
website at

http://www.unmpress.com/pdf/F07catalog.pdf

on page 32. It won't be out until Sept or Oct, but it can be ordered now. If
anyone wants a review copy, let me know! I hope I don't sound like a cad
spilling the beans all over...I've just been working so long!

Jennifer

Dear Friends,

My first book, The Next Settlement, received the Vassar Miller Prize and
is now out from UNT Press. The book can be ordered via amazon or directly
from Texas A&M: http://www.tamu.edu/upress/BOOKS/2007/robins.htm

Shortly I'll also forward a list of New England and New York readings with
poets Christopher Janke and Elizabeth Hughey.

Best wishes,

Thought Someone might benefit from this:



Hi - I'm David and I'd like to share an opportunity with you
and your group as we are reaching out to like minded groups
inclusive of beginners and pros. I am the Artistic Director of
Riprap Studio Theatre in North Hollywood, California and I co-
produce a weekly television broadcast - RIPRAP ENTERTAINMENT TV
with Sandra Nutt (the owner / operator of Riprap Studio
Theatre). We are reaching out to colleges and students and
groups like yours to invite you and your group to submit; or
just watch and learn and take part in our evolution.

Our weekly televised broadcast promotes writers world-wide.
It's designed to find the next great stage play to mount at our
theatre in North Hollywood, CA and we would love to share the
opportunity with your group. It's free and will always be free
since our inception in 1999.

We accept stage plays, screenplays, novels, short stories,
teleplays and musicals for discussion, critique, feedback
and/or award. Sandra, the owner adapted her screenplay for the
stage and HBO requested the original script.

We would like to expose novice and veteran writers to the same
opportunity - that is our concept - for those who might not
otherwise have a chance in Hollywood. No promises, just a fun
show designed to entertain and educate the public about the
writing process, while providing a valuable opportunity.

We have a segment called SCRIPT ANALYSIS wherein we read,
discuss, critique new works for consideration for possible
production on our stage in North Hollywood. We recently added
RIPRAP UNIVERSITY tutorials - also free and I notice you are
writing a book chapter by chapter, our first endeavor is to
write a screenplay three pages at a time on video on our web
site. Perhaps that will be valuable to you and your members as
well.

I'll keep the email short, but if you think you or your members
would be interested in this opportunity, please distribute our
flyer to your members and email me with ANY questions that you
may have.

We also post segments of our broadcast on our web site every
week after the show and you can see them at:
http://www.riprapentertain.com/

FLYER is at:
http://www.riprapentertain.com/invitation.pdf

Thank you very much for your time Mike and best of luck and
continued success in your group and endeavors.

Kind regards,

what Alison Croggon wrote:
"In fact, here it predictably goes - Yale bans fake swords on stage in
response to Virginia Tech massacre! A totally insane response, which seems
to be more about making sure art behaves itself than anything else."

Oh boy!  And I was trying to stay out of this discussion!  Mainly because
I already know how much hate mail I'll be getting.  But here it goes.

First off I think Alison you are right on!

Two things I want to add to this discussion though.  The first about class.
The second about guns and why they've been good in my life,
which I know is not going to go over very well.

First part though.  The average age of those killed in this unfortunate,
terrible situation in Virginia are roughly the average ages of those
young Americans killed in Iraq nearly every single day.  WHERE IS
THE PRESIDENT'S MOURNING ON INTERNATIONAL TELEVISION
FOR THEM!?  Oh, that's right, they're just poor and working class
kids (for the most part), and we don't really care enough about them.
They don't have the same structure of importance built around them for
us to actually, and really mourn them.  Hell, we're not even allowed to
see their fucking flag draped coffins!

And what about the HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS killed in Iraq as a
direct finger to America's aggression?  WHY THE FUCK ISN'T YALE
SENDING OUT A PRESS RELEASE TO BAN THE USE OF TANKS
AND OTHER MURDEROUS WEAPONS WORLDWIDE!?  Oh that's
right, because at Yale the poor and working class can only be found
behind the counter in the cafeteria, working.  And they should be
grateful for those jobs!  Right?

If as much attention were given EVERY SINGLE DAY to the war in
Iraq (OUR war in Iraq) as we've been spending EVERY SINGLE
DAY on the massacre in Virginia, we might actually stand a chance
to put an end to this bloody mess!

Why do we choose to mourn so loudly for one and not the other?
Yes I know I've already said I believe it to be class, which I do, I
very much do.  And race too of course.  It's such a racist war we
are in over there.  Do you think France would have allowed us to
invade Poland?  Or some other nice, white place?  They wag their
fingers, but a lot of fucking good finger waving has done, right?

It's terrible, the hypocrisy of caring over here, not caring over there.
Entire families suffer every single DAY in Iraq because YOU and I
continue to pay our taxes like obedient little rodents, feeding this
Death Machine!  YOU and I are such bastards!  Such cowards,
YOU and I are!

I'm terrified of prison.  I'm paying my taxes.  And the suffering, the
endless misery is accounted for by my inaction, my fear, my
inescapable selfishness of not wanting to starve or be jailed.
Do you pay your taxes?  Are you hiding from the IRS?
Good for you, brave soul.

Now another difficult thing to discuss.  After all, Ron Silliman just
wrote on his blog that anyone owning a gun is an idiot.  I'm
paraphrasing, but close.  Well Ron SO BE IT!

It was a rifle that saved my six year old sister's life, and my
ten year old life when our drunken, disgusting step father was
trying to get into her bedroom.  I was on the other side of the
door with that gun.  Door locked.  And he never came through
the door, but if he had, the gun, which was loaded, and safety
off, would have been Plan B to the locked door as Plan A.
I was terrified, but there's no doubt I would have shot him!

And it was a handgun that saved my sister's life a few years
ago when she pointed it at the head of a stalker who broke
down her door.  She was steady and ready to shoot.  And he
could see that, and he took off, and never, EVER bothered
her again!  If my sister did not have that gun, and didn't feel
confident that she could protect herself, that piece of shit man
would have tried to rape and kill her.  He was crazy enough.

Am I saying that EVERYBODY should be able to buy a gun?
Am I on Mister Planet of the Apes Heston's side?  No.  The
extremes can be seen from any side.  It's ridiculous to be
giving guns to minors.  But I'm glad I was given that rifle as
a kid, and taught to shoot it.  There are more guns than
people in my family, by far, and most of those guns are
for hunting.  But I'm a vegetarian now for many years.
And I no longer own a gun.  Haven't for a long time.  But
I'm glad my sister has one.  She's slender, strong, but
knows certain men could overwhelm her.  She's a good
fighter, but why should she have to fight when all she has
to do is point a gun and YELL at him that if he dares to
touch her his pretty little brains will splatter all over her
walls I ask you?

THE PINK PISTOLS are heroes of mine.  I've been in the
closet long enough about my queer heroes.  These men
and women have the slogan, WE BASH BACK!  None of
them as far as I know are out there randomly, wantonly
threatening the general population.  They, like me, are
just sick and fucking tired of being pushed around for no
good reason other than the fact of being queer.

Yes I understand the concerns about the guns in our
country, but at the same time I've actually been in the
situation where a gun was going to save my life if the
lock on the door failed.  And I'm grateful my sister is
a good shot, and unafraid of this world because of it.

Call me an idiot, I've been called worse,
CAConrad

"Japanese paper appears delicate, but it is strong because of its long
fibers. I love it because it has this translucent flimsiness that sort of
defies its truer self. The idea of painting pictures on such paper interests
me even more so because the ink moves across this paper as if it were
bleeding. I think of this work as napkins-images quickly painted, something
to wipe your mouth with after you've been too polite, or maybe even for
coughing up odd nightmares." -Nancy Kiefer

One thing that I've noted, with some discomfort, is the number of
newscasters who refer to this event as "the worst peacetime shooting in
American history." The degree to which people seem able to forget that
this country is "at war," and what the implications of that are is
staggering.

Now available: THAT ABRUPT HERE, poems by Joel Bettridge
59 pp | Paperback | $12.00 | ISBN 0-9773401-1-2
The Cultural Society: http://culturalsociety.org/thainfo

In THAT ABRUPT HERE Joel Bettridge proposes an entirely tender yet
radical new imagination of the elegy: i.e. a blessing underway; a
ceremony in wandering search of its proper and beloved lost occasion.
In the deep-root meaning of the word, these poems are momentous. —
Donald Revell

THAT ABRUPT HERE is as desperate and as alive as a first-time
skydiver. I love it for its manic hospitality, its teary smirk, its
warm and unforgettable hum. This book thinks my heart in. — Graham
Foust

Joel Bettridge's meticulous enumeration of the present is an implicit
argument for poetry as seeing. His phrases are not so much written as
carved into precise optical instruments that draw light from the fine
detail of the daily, which for him extends seamlessly from the most
intimate moments to the most global events. He makes this great range
immediate, and he makes it matter. — Cole Swenson

In connection with Pinsky talking in Slate about Difficult Poetry, I
was off the Poetics List for a long time and I don't know if there has
been any discussion lately of contemporary Easy Poetry.

If you want to see lots of samples of easy poetry [which is the kind
that the Poetry Foundation wants everyone to read, listen to, and buy]
take a look at the archives of the ***Writers Almanac*** [especially
for the last three years] which, in case you don't know, is a five-
minute American Public Radio program hosted by Garrison Keillor, where
he gives biographical info about poets and writers and at the end he
recites a poem. Here in Buffalo it can be heard on WNED-FM 94.5,
Monday through Friday, starting at 6:30am.

You'll find the archives at

Content-Type: text/plain; charset=iso-8859-1

In a review of the movie "300" in the current London Review of Books, Michael Wood writes, "The novelist and the movie-makers are not fascists; only in love with a fascist fantasy, and perhaps even in love only with its picture possibilities." But I wonder: What is a fascist if not someone in love with fascist fantasies?

  Does anyone have any thoughts on whether this distinction can really be maintained or not?

  Think of someone saying, "Albert Speer wasn't a Nazi, he just loved its architectural possibilities."

Dear All, especially in NYC,=20
I'll be in in New York on Friday for a MiPoesias reading with David Lehman =
and Elaine Equi at the Stain Bar in Brooklyn, 7pm, and would be interested =
to know of other poetry events later that evening/night, being a complete =
poetry drone & having no imagination outside that rhyme scheme.  I know of =
the Nuyorican final (but it's the final & I prefer things in their =
off-times!).
Hints & leads welcomed,

Amy Goodman from DEMOCRACY NOW is the only one who is investigating
(with absolute fearlessness she is investigating) how ALL, and I really do
mean
ALL the major news networks in America are conglomerates which actually
OWN weapons manufacturing plants.  It is -- believe it or not -- in the
interest
of the owners of ABC, CBS, NBC, CNN, to wage war.  Shareholders are dancing
the Iraq two-step these days.  And we need to ask ourselves the rather
obvious
questions now about "conflict of interest."  And beyond that, ask ourselves
how
this measures against Jefferson's line "Information is the currency of
democracy."
Hmm, puts a whole new spin on the "currency" of the statement.  But it is
the
JOB OF our esteemed, televised news teams to help us forget.  Help us forget
our daily sins.  Help us forget our daily brutality.  In Philadelphia THEY
RECENTLY
changed the morning news to "Good Day Philadelphia!"  Good Day Philadelphia?
HOW ABSURD!!!!  Of the 10 largest cities in America we rank highest in
poverty.
Literally one in four Philadelphians is living below the poverty line, me
included.
Good Day Philadelphia my ass!

Not much difference between Mel Gibson's
ghastly movie "The Passion (of The Christ)"
and "300". Both rely for their effects almost
entirely on sadomasochistic narcissism. Same
culture of brownshirt pseudomasculinity, camp
interest in military uniforms, obsessions with
mutilation and--the clincher--a hatred of the
other. A breast-plate by any other hang still
guards a totalitarian heart.

"In a review of the movie "300" in the current London Review of Books,
Michael Wood writes, "The novelist and the movie-makers are not fascists;
only in love with a fascist fantasy, and perhaps even in love only with its
picture possibilities." But I wonder: What is a fascist if not someone in
love with fascist fantasies?
Does anyone have any thoughts on whether this distinction can really be
maintained or not?"

Michael Wood is an apologist for the worst.  How is the London Review of
Books
not asking for better insight than that?  That's stunning.  The distinction
can only
be maintained by those who are as lost as he is.

Maybe the novelist, reviewer and moviemakers are suffering from some sort of
collective S&M emotional branding.  An old, good friend of mine for many
years
invited me to this huge Philadelphia S&M bash a few years ago and man oh man
was I in for a surprise.  My friend (won't mention her name) is an African
American
woman, and there she was on the floor, walking on her hands and knees,
naked,
except for a collar which was connected to a leash being held by
her caucasian
boyfriend who was dressed in an SS officer's uniform, complete with
swastika.

As disturbing as this was for me (no one else seemed to mind) I was certain
she
had something in mind, since she was dedicated to seeing her therapist every
week and working her life out.  About six months later she invited me to a
poetry
reading she was giving at a Borders Bookstore out in the suburbs.  The
reading
was in the cafe.  There were all these clean, white, very white, upper
middle
class, well mannered folk with their coffee.  She announced that she wasn't
going to read poems, and instead read from her journals she kept before and
after her therapy sessions.  Wow.  The entire reading was about being
sexually
molested by her father, and how her nazi boyfriend (she referred to him as
an
armchair nazi, which I guess is preferable?) helped her work through her
issues
in the S&M scene, working her down into the most humiliating, lowest
possible
denominator of how she felt about herself.  Her epiphanies about her life,
her
worth, her broken heart and broken spirit came flooding to the surface when
in the middle of these public S&M parties.  She broke up with her boyfriend
with a handshake, thanking him.  Of course the Borders Bookstore customers
were horrified, leaving as fast as they could, leaving just me and two goth
teenage kids seated in the cafe.  It was a strange, beautiful reading.  Her
brave, and odd sense of exploration into herself was a lesson that jumped
the tracks on any kind of lesson usually permitted.

Sometimes I feel that America and England are one big S&M play scene.
Maybe the whole world is.  But our give and take, and the way we hide
everything in the church, or the meth, or the hopes of our fascist leaders
(especially those fascists who hide it the best, like Hillary Clinton), or
the
dumbass movies, make us complicit every single day in upholding this
racist, murderous, insatiable, potentially apocalyptic empire.  Our very
consumption, our endless consumption, drives all of this corruption and
suffering right to the door of every house on earth these days.  300 is a
pep rally.  The extraordinary film THE HOLY MOUNTAIN has moments
where it openly mimics such "fascist fantasy" to expose the soul of our
daily shortcomings for one another.  Where 300 creates a spectacle of
action and effects to stimulate, THE HOLY MOUNTAIN takes it down to
the super absurd, to show us as coming just shy of cannibalistic.  The
genius of Alejandro Jodorowsky is giving you your spectacle and rubbing
your face in it, instead of filling your belly and dazzling you.  Jokorowsky
comes shy of making you ashamed of being human.  Just shy enough of
it to give you hope.

I agree with Barry in that fascism and nazism (and I would add communism)
developed not only a politics but also and ethics and an aesthetics - the
latter playing a significant role in the appeal such movements had. There
is, as Barry seems to suggest, an aesthetic fascination for fascism.
Evidence abounds in the history of 20th-century literature and arts (and it
is not always the "kitsch" side that works). Another point of agreement wit=
h
Barry is on the place of fantasy in the fascist and more generally
totalitarian worldview. A colleague from Kluj in Romania was telling me of
this impression he had during the last decade of Ceaucescu's reign of being
part of a psychotic delusion: even if one kept more or less sane, one
belonged willy-nilly to the insanity of the regime. Even the very suffering
people endured in their everyday life was taken from them and made "unreal"
by a mad propaganda.
However, I think we must be very careful in calling anyone a "fascist".
True,  a fascist is someone in love with a fascist fantasy but not everyone
in love with a fascist fantasy is a fascist stricto sensu (and I believe we
should keep as much as possible to a restricted sense of the term in order
not to weaken it and make it useless for political analysis). A person in
love with fascist fantasies may easily become a fascist, given proper
circumstances. Or, perhaps more likely, she will let things happen that she
might deeply regret having let happen later. But it takes a little more tha=
n
just fascination. Fascism, and nazism were "activist" ideologies. True
enough, they fed on the passive fascination of the many. Active
participation still remains a different matter and each has to be dealt wit=
h
differently.
As for "300", it DOES stink. On the kitsch side of fascist aesthetics...

yeah, it's a creepy film -- but are we critiquing the movie or the
graphic novel? I haven't read Miller's work, but I had the distinct
sense that I was watching a moving-picture version of the comic book (a
term I use because the composition and implementation of all the scenes
was, yes, comic-book- like) ... seemed true to an original text, rather
than something the director dreamed up.=20

was there a coherent political viewpoint? it certainly wasn't true to
ancient Spartan politics (and don't get me started on the gross-out/
tease sequence with the ephors in an impossibly remote temple up some
godforsaken mountain).=20

how many ways can you turn Leonidas' verbal attack on the forces of
"mysticism and tyranny" -- don't the (historical) Spartans, along with
their modern fascist equivalents, partake of both in great heaps in
order to retain their power over the masses? (cf. the enslavement of
Messenia, et al.)

wrote this last autumn, well before I'd ever heard of "300" :

the dentals
the dentifrice
the dentals under the frieze
were thrown into a refuse pit and buried
after the temple was destroyed.
Persians broke their enemies'
teeth on the walls
before they sailed back
to Persepolis.

I started blogging on this, but it seems to me that Pinsky's 1) examples
aren't particularly challenging poems, 2) he leaves some open questions

i believe fascism is in everybody.
fascism is in the playground, at school, at work, and in the bedroom.
the desire to have power over another person, by strength or deceipt.
it is linked to the survival instinct.
it was not born with hitler.
it did not die with hitler.
it is eternal.
how much we allow it to overtake us is what defines us as individuals.
i try daily to contain the fascist in me.

I agree with Barry in that fascism and nazism (and I would add communism)
developed not only a politics but also and ethics and an aesthetics - the
latter playing a significant role in the appeal such movements had. There
is, as Barry seems to suggest, an aesthetic fascination for fascism.
Evidence abounds in the history of 20th-century literature and arts (and it
is not always the "kitsch" side that works). Another point of agreement wit=
h
Barry is on the place of fantasy in the fascist and more generally
totalitarian worldview. A colleague from Kluj in Romania was telling me of
this impression he had during the last decade of Ceaucescu's reign of being
part of a psychotic delusion: even if one kept more or less sane, one
belonged willy-nilly to the insanity of the regime. Even the very suffering
people endured in their everyday life was taken from them and made "unreal"
by a mad propaganda.
However, I think we must be very careful in calling anyone a "fascist".
True,  a fascist is someone in love with a fascist fantasy but not everyone
in love with a fascist fantasy is a fascist stricto sensu (and I believe we
should keep as much as possible to a restricted sense of the term in order
not to weaken it and make it useless for political analysis). A person in
love with fascist fantasies may easily become a fascist, given proper
circumstances. Or, perhaps more likely, she will let things happen that she
might deeply regret having let happen later. But it takes a little more tha=
n
just fascination. Fascism, and nazism were "activist" ideologies. True
enough, they fed on the passive fascination of the many. Active
participation still remains a different matter and each has to be dealt wit=
h
differently.
As for "300", it DOES stink. On the kitsch side of fascist aesthetics...

Faraj Bayraqdar was born in 1951 in Tir, a village near Homs in =20
central Syria. He began publishing poetry while still in high school. =20=

At the University of Damascus, he and a group of friends started a =20
literary journal, but certain texts published in it led to his arrest =20=

and imprisonment for three months. His first collection, You Are Not =20
Alone, came out in 1979 and was quickly followed by two more. He =20
stopped writing in the early 1980s due to commitments in the Syrian =20
Communist Labor Party; his wife, also a party member, was arrested =20
and spent four years in prison. In 1987, Bayraqdar was arrested again =20=

and remained in prison without trial until 1993, when he was =20
sentenced to fifteen years of hard labor for belonging to an =20
unauthorized political association. His imprisonment lasted more than =20=

thirteen years, in three different prisons (the Palestine Division, =20
Tadmor, and Saydnaya). Without his knowledge, a group of friends in =20
Beirut published Dove in Free Flight, from which the poems here have =20
been selected. The book was used, Elias Khoury writes, as =93one of the =20=

instruments of pressure on the Syrian authorities to mobilize =20

to set the poet free.=94 After an international campaign was mounted on =20=

Rebecca Johnson is a doctoral student in Comparative Literature at =20

poetry have appeared in Banipal Magazine and =20
www.wordswithoutborders.com, and her translation of Sinan =20
Antoon'snovel, I`jaam: An Iraqi Rhapsody, is available from City =20
Lights Press.

Born in Beirut in 1948, Elias Khoury is the author of eleven novels, =20
four volumes of literary criticism, and three plays. The publication =20
of his first novel On the Relations of the Circle (1975) entered him =20
into the Beirut vanguard of modern Arabic literature, which was =20
seeking to create new dimensions in the movement of modernism. =20
Khoury=92s commitment to Palestinian human rights began when he visited =20=

a refugee camp in Jordan at age nineteen. Khoury has been an advocate =20=

ever since, devoting his energies to the Palestine Research Center in =20=

Beirut and speaking out in articles, essays, and through his fiction. =20=

Khoury is currently the Editor-in-Chief of the cultural supplement of =20=

Beirut=92s daily newspaper, An-Nahar, and is a Global Distinguished =20

That is a silly belief, in my opinion.
Fascism is a political system,
and one that calls for the tossing away of the sense of the individual,
hence the fasces.

I've read so much about this movie (for and against) that I'm kind of
curious. Part of me wants to know how it's any different from any other
Hollywood action movie where the Bad Guys are aliens (literally or
figuratively), the women get it and the clean American hero wins through
impossible odds, with or without wife intact. They all, from Tom Cruise
down, irritate me beyond measure; especially the WW2 fantasies about how
America saved everybody (eg that U-boat film where they changed what
happened to make Americans the heroes and how it all ties into that shit
about the Great Generation that Bush et al feed off so cynically - waiting
for the US movie on Stalingrad where General Macarthur saves the day). Mind
you, British films/action novels were just the same when Britain had
delusions of empire. Is this really any worse? Or is it just more obvious? I
guess I'll wait for a bored night at home and get it out on dvd.

Genet, a passionate advocate for Palestine among other things and surely one
of the most interesting moralists around, wrote several fantasies around the
homerotics of Nazi glamour. I wouldn't call him a Fascist by any means. It's
a word used rather too easily these days, which is a shame, as Tom says,
because it does describe the efficient corporate-military state.

All best

border guard googled his work.

Andrew Feldmar, a well-known Vancouver psychotherapist, rolled up to the
Blaine border crossing last summer as he had hundreds of times in his
career. At 66, his gray hair, neat beard, and rimless glasses give him =
the
look of a seasoned intellectual. He handed his passport to the U.S. =
border
guard and relaxed, thinking he would soon be with an old friend in =
Seattle.
The border guard turned to his computer and googled "Andrew Feldmar."=20
The psychotherapist's world was about to turn upside down.
Born in Hungary to Jewish parents as the Nazis were rising to power, =
Feldmar
was hidden from the Nazis during the Holocaust when he was three years =
old,
after his parents were condemned to Auschwitz. Miraculously, his parents
both returned alive and in 1945 Hungary was liberated by the Russian =
army.
Feldmar escaped from communist Hungary in 1956 when he was 16 and =
immigrated
to Canada. He has been married to Meredith Feldmar, an artist, for 37 =
years,
and they live in Vancouver's Kitsilano neighbourhood. They have two
children, Soma, 33, who lives in Denver, and Marcel, 36, a resident of =
L.A.
Highly respected in his field, Feldmar has been travelling to the U.S. =
for
work and to see his family five or six times a year. He has worked for =
the
UN, in Sarajevo and in Minsk with Chernobyl victims.=20
The Blaine border guard explained that Feldmar had been pulled out of =
the
line as part of a random search. He seemed friendly, even as he took =
away
Feldmar's passport and car keys. While the contents of his car were =
being
searched, Feldmar and the officer talked. He asked Feldmar what =
profession
he was in.=20
When Feldmar said he was psychologist, the official typed his name into =
his
Internet search engine. Before long the customs guard was engrossed in =
an
article Feldmar had published in the spring 2001 issue of the journal =
Janus
Head. The article concerned an acid trip Feldmar had taken in London,
Ontario, and another in London, England, almost forty years ago. It also
alluded to the fact that he had used hallucinogenics as a "path" to
understanding self and that in certain cases, he reflected, it could "be
preferable to psychiatry." Everything seemed to collapse around him, as =
a
quiet day crossing the border began to turn into a nightmare.

Fingerprints for FBI
He was told to sit down on a folding chair and for hours he wondered =
where
this was going. He checked his watch and thought hopelessly of his =
friend
who was about to land at the Seattle airport. Three hours later, the
official motioned him into a small, barren room with an American flag. =
He
was sitting on one side and Feldmar was on the other. The official said =
that
under the Homeland Security Act, Feldmar was being denied entry due to
"narcotics" use. LSD is not a narcotic substance, Feldmar tried to =
explain,
but an entheogen. The guard wasn't interested in technicalities. He =
asked
for a statement from Feldmar admitting to having used LSD and he
fingerprinted Feldmar for an FBI file.
Then Feldmar disbelievingly listened as he learned that he was being =
barred
from ever entering the United States again. The officer told him he =
could
apply to the Department of Homeland Security for a waiver, if he wished, =
and
gave him a package, with the forms.=20
The border guard then escorted him to his car and made sure he did a =
U-turn
and went back to Canada.

'Curious. Very curious'
Feldmar attended the University of Toronto where he graduated with =
honours
in mathematics, physics and chemistry. He received his M.A. in =
psychology
from the University of Western Ontario. At University of Western =
Ontario, he
was under supervision with Zenon Pylyshyn, who was from Saskatchewan and =
had
participated, along with Abram Hoffer and Duncan Blewett, in the first
experiments with LSD-25.=20
"Zenon told me he had had enough strange experiences, that he had gone =
about
as far with LSD as he wished to go. He still had what was once legal....
Looking back 33 years, I don't quite recall why I decided to accept his
tentative offer. I was 27 years old and thought of myself as a rational
scientist, and had no experience with delirium, hallucination, or =
altered
mind states. I was curious. Very curious. I thought that, like Faust, I
might make a pact with the devil in return for esoteric knowledge."
Zenon gave him 900 micrograms of acid and the surprise of his life, he =
wrote
in the Janus Head article. "Following this initiation, I traveled to =
many
regions many times with the help of many different substances. I took
peyote, psilocybin mushrooms, cannabis, MDMA, DMT, ketamine, nitrous =
oxide
5-MEO-DMT, but I kept coming back to LSD. Acid seemed my most spacious, =
most
helpful ally. While on it, I explored my past, regressed to the womb, to =
my
conception. I remembered, grieved, and mourned many painful events. I =
saw
how my parents would have liked to love me, and how they didn't because =
they
didn't know how. I learned, on acid, to endure troubling and frightening
states of mind. This enabled me, as meditation has done, to identify =
with
being the witness of the workings of my mind, observing whatever was =
going
on, while knowing that I was simply captivated by the forms produced by =
my
own psyche."
After receiving his MA, Feldmar spent a semester in the U.S. at the =
Johns
Hopkins University's Ph.D. program in theoretical statistics. In 1969, =
he
began Ph.D. work with Dr. Charles Osgood in psycholinguistics at the
University of Illinois at Champagne Urbana. He did further Ph.D. studies =
at
Simon Fraser University.

Legal options expensive
Feldmar was determined, in the months after the aborted border crossing, =
to
turn things around. He was particularly determined because the idea of =
not
being able to visit his children at their homes was unthinkable.=20
He contacted the U.S. Consul in Vancouver to protest and was again told =
to
apply for a waiver. When he consulted Seattle attorney Bob Free at
MacDonald, Hoague and Bayless about going through this process, he =
learned
that for $3,500 (U.S.) plus incidentals, he'd have a 90 per cent chance =
to
get the waiver, but it would probably be just for a year, and the =
procedure
would have to be initiated again, any time he wished to cross the =
border.
Each time, he would have to produce a statement saying that he had been
"rehabilitated."=20
He looked into filing suit against the U.S. government for wrongdoing =
but
gave up the idea when he learned that a legal battle with U.S. Customs =
would
cost his life's savings and, with the balance of power tipped so =
extremely
in the government's favor, he would almost surely lose.
Again, he appealed to the U.S. Consulate. The consulate wouldn't return =
his
phone calls, but in this e-mail message to Feldmar, the consulate =
explained
its position.
"Both our countries have very similar regulations regarding issuance of
visas for citizens who have violated the law. The issue here is not the
writing of an article, but the taking of controlled substances. I hear =
from
American citizens all the time who have decades-old DUI convictions who =
are
barred from entry into Canada and who must apply for waivers. Same thing
here. Waiver is the only way."=20

Ensnared by Section IV
"Admitted drug use is admitted drug use," says Mike Milne, spokesman for
U.S. border and protection, based in Seattle. Milne said he could not
comment specifically on the Feldmar case, due to privacy issues, but he
quoted from the U.S. Immigration Law Handbook section which refers to
"general classes of aliens ineligible to receive visas and ineligible =
for
admissions" to help shed light on the clauses that may have ensnared the
Vancouver psychotherapist.
"Persons with AIDS, tuberculosis, infectious diseases are inadmissible,"
Milne said. And then there is Section IV. "Anyone who is determined to =
be a
drug abuser or user is inadmissible. A crime involving moral turpitude =
is
inadmissible and one of those areas is a violation of controlled
substances."
If there's no criminal record, as in Feldmar's case?=20
Not necessarily the criterion, Milne said. You can still be considered
dangerous.

'More diligent and vigilant'
"The level of scrutiny at our nation's borders have definitely gone up =
since
the 9-11 disaster and we are more diligent and vigilant in checking =
people's
identities and criminal histories at our nation's borders."
Milne goes on, "There are three main areas that we have employed since =
9-11
to better secure our borders. First is the number of officers we have
working at our borders. We've doubled the numbers at the border. We've
combined officers from Homeland Security and border protection. We =
brought
in the officers from immigration and naturalization service, the =
department
of agriculture and U.S. border patrol. By combining the expertise of =
those
disparate border agencies into a single agency under a single management
with the single purpose of protecting the U.S. against terrorism and =
other
related offences, it created a more effective border agency. It created =
a
more secure border.=20
"The second thing would be our information systems, our watch list =
systems
are better shared within the U.S. government and between governments,
between information sharing agreements, through Interpol, through =
terrorist
watch list sharing internationally, we have better access for our front =
line
officers to query information systems up to and including public based
systems, including the Internet. Third, we have better infrastructure at =
our
entries. We have cameras in some of our more remote points of entry, =
gates,
lighting, to make them more secure. We do more checks at the borders. It
depends on what level of alert we're at. At certain alert levels we do =
100
per cent identity checks."

War on drugs meets war on terror
Eugene Oscapella is an Ottawa lawyer, who lectures on drug policy issues =
in
the department of criminology at the University of Ottawa. He also works =
as
a policy advisor to a range of government agencies and departments,
including the Office of the Privacy Commissioner of Canada. Oscapella =
sees
the American security system upgrades and the potential uses alarming.
"This is about the marriage of the war on drugs and the war on terror, =
and
the blind, bureaucratic mindset it encourages. Government surveillance =
in
the name of the war on drugs and the war on terror is in danger of =
making us
all open books to zealous governments. As someone mentioned at a privacy
conference I attended in London, U.K., several months ago, all the tools =
for
an authoritarian state are now in place; it's just that we haven't yet
adopted authoritarian methods. But in the area of drugs, maybe we have."

'Ominous omen'
Feldmar was in the process of considering whether to apply for a waiver =
when
he sought help from Ethan Nadlemann, director of the Drug Policy =
Alliance in
New York, whose financial backer is another Hungarian, George Soros.=20
Nadlemann was outraged. "Nobel Peace prize winners, some of the great
scientists and writers in the world have experimented with LSD in their
time. We know people are being pulled out of lines and racially profiled =
as
part of the war against terrorism. But this is a different kind of =
travesty,
banning someone because they used a substance in another country thirty
years ago," he said.=20
In February he wrote Feldmar, "Not that it helps much, but I just want =
you
to know that I have not forgotten you or your situation. I feel =
frustrated
vis a vis the media, and on other avenues, but I am not forgetting. I =
really
think this situation is absurd, and an ominous omen of things to come."
When Feldmar was barred from entering the U.S., he joined the ranks of =
other
intellectuals and artists. Pop singer Cat Stevens was turned back from =
the
U.S. in 2004, after being detained. Bolivian human rights leader and =
lawyer,
Leonida Zurita Vargas was prevented from entering in February of 2006. =
She
was planning to be in the U.S. as part of a three week speaking tour on
Bolivian social movements and human rights. The tour would have taken =
her to
Vermont, Harvard, Stanford and Washington D.C., but she never got beyond =
the
airport check-in at Santa Cruz, Bolivia where she was informed her =
ten-year
visa had been revoked because of alleged links to terrorist activity.=20
'Ideological exclusion provision'
The U.S. Department of Homeland Security denied Professor John Milios =
entry
into the country upon his arrival at John F. Kennedy International =
Airport
last June. Milios, a faculty member at the National Technical University =
of
Athens, had planned to present a paper at a conference titled "How Class
Works" at the State University of New York at Stony Brook. Milios told
Academe Online that U.S. officials questioned him at the airport about =
his
political ideas and affiliations and that the American consul in Athens
later queried him about the same subjects. Milios, a member of a =
left-wing
political party, is active in Greek national politics and has twice been =
a
candidate for the Greek parliament. Milios's visa, issued in 1996, was =
set
to expire in November. The professor had previously been allowed entry =
into
the United States on five separate occasions to participate in academic
meetings.=20
The American Civil Liberties Union, on behalf of the American Academy of
Religion, the American Association of University Professors and PEN =
American
Center, filed a lawsuit this year challenging a provision of the Patriot =
Act
that is being used to deny visas to foreign scholars. They did this =
after
Professor Tariq Ramadan, a Swiss intellectual, had his visa revoked =
under
"the ideological exclusion provision" of the Patriot Act, preventing him
from assuming a tenured teaching position at the University of Notre =
Dame.
It's a suit that attempts to prevent the practice of ideological =
exclusion
more generally, a practice that led to the recent exclusions of Dora =
Maria
Tellez, a Nicaraguan scholar who had been offered a position at Harvard
University, as well as numerous scholars from Cuba.=20
In March 2005, the ACLU filed a Freedom of Information Act request to =
learn
more about the government's use of the Patriot Act ideological exclusion
provision. Cuban Grammy nominee Ibrahim Ferrer, 77, who came to fame in =
the
1999 film Buena Vista Social Club, was blocked by the U.S. government =
from
attending the Grammy Awards, where he was nominated for the Best Latin =
album
award in 2004. So were his fellow musicians Guillermo Rubalcaba, Amadito
Valdes, Barbarito Torres and the group Septeto Nacional with Ignacio
Pineiro. The list goes on.

Cut off from friends
Nine months after being turned back at the border, Feldmar has concluded
that his banishment is permanent. The waiver process is exhausting, =
costly
and demeaning. The David and Goliath aspect of the situation is too
daunting.
This is devastating to his family and friends. "My father was doing =
nothing
wrong, illegal, suspicious, or at all deviant in any way, when he was =
trying
to visit the U.S.," his daughter, Soma, an instructor at a Denver =
college,
says. "In terms of family it really sucks. "=20
It's hard for his friend, Alphonso Lingis, a professor of philosophy at
Pennsylvania State University. "I'm deeply pained by the prospect of no
longer being able to welcome him in the United States," Lingis said. =
"The
notion that he and his work could harm anyone is preposterous. He's a =
victim
of scandalous bureaucratic incompetence by the United States officials
involved in this matter."

'Alchemist's dictum'
When Feldmar looks back on what has happened, he concludes that he was
operating out of a sense of safety that has become dated in the last six
years, since 9-11. His real mistake was to write about his drug =
experiences
and post this on the web, even in a respected journal like Janus Head. =
He
acknowledges that he had not considered posting on the Internet the risk
that it turned out to be. So many of his generation share his experience =
in
experimenting with drugs, after all. He believed it was safe to =
communicate
about the past from the depth of retrospection and that this would be a
useful grain of personal wisdom to share with others. He now warns his
friends to think twice before they post anything about their personal =
lives
on the web.=20
"I didn't heed the ancient Alchemists' dictum, 'Do, dare, and be =
silent,'"
Feldmar says. "And yet, the experience of being treated as undesirable =
was
shocking. The helplessness, the utter uselessness of trying to be seen =
as I
know myself and as I am known generally by those I care about and who =
care
about me, the reduction of me to an undesirable offender, was truly
frightening. I became aware of the fragility of my identity, the =
brittleness
of a way of life.
"Memories of having been the object of the objectifying gaze crowd into =
my
mind. I have been seen and labeled as a Jew, as a Communist, as a D. P.
(Displaced Person), as a student, as a patient, a man, a Hungarian, a
refugee, an =E9migr=E9, an immigrant.... Now I am being seen as one of =
those
drug users, perhaps an addict, perhaps a dealer, one can't be sure. In =
the
matter of a second, I became powerless, whatever I said wasn't going to =
be
taken seriously. I was labeled, sorted and disposed of. Dismissed."

For Anyone in the SF Bay Area this weekend, a collaboration I have
been working on will be performed on April 27th and 28th as part of
ODC's Pilot 50. Entitled Study 2013, the piece involves dance, video,
text and sound in an exploration of the fears and hopes, information
and confusion around the constantly recurring end of the world we
seem to be living through. This condensed version of the piece
features alongside many exciting premieres from local choreographers
and performance artists. We will be showing a variation on the piece
again in May, as part of StreamFest and Counterpulse, all in
preparation for an evening length work some time in the fall.

Cheers,

Dillon



What: PILOT 50
When: Friday, April 27 and Saturday, April 28
Time: 8pm
Where: ODC Theater, 3153 17th Street @ Shotwell St., SF
Cost: $15
How: call ODC Box office at 415/ 863-9834
More: go to http://www.odcdance.org or http://www.pilot50.info

For this, the 50th Pilot, ODC hand-picked eight emerging
choreographers to present.  Damara Ganley and Ami Student explore the
relationship of cultural and personal fragmentation through the lens
of post-holocaust Jewish American heritage.  Michelle Lynch
investigates the space in between intimacy and distance.  Andrew Wass
presents the internal negotiation and struggle between desire and
duty.  Catherine Galasso studies female hysteria and its
transcendence. Lesley Braithwaite presents a character solo somewhere
between the lofty Pavlova and Calamity Jane.  Abby Neitlich Rappoport
and Cara DeFabio engage the audience to interpret and question the
tension and comedy of the End of Times.


Hope to see you there!

For Anyone in the SF Bay Area this weekend, a collaboration I have
been working on will be performed on April 27th and 28th as part of
ODC's Pilot 50. Entitled Study 2013, the piece involves dance, video,
text and sound in an exploration of the fears and hopes, information
and confusion around the constantly recurring end of the world we
seem to be living through. This condensed version of the piece
features alongside many exciting premieres from local choreographers
and performance artists. We will be showing a variation on the piece
again in May, as part of StreamFest and Counterpulse, all in
preparation for an evening length work some time in the fall.

Cheers,

Dillon



What: PILOT 50
When: Friday, April 27 and Saturday, April 28
Time: 8pm
Where: ODC Theater, 3153 17th Street @ Shotwell St., SF
Cost: $15
How: call ODC Box office at 415/ 863-9834
More: go to http://www.odcdance.org or http://www.pilot50.info

For this, the 50th Pilot, ODC hand-picked eight emerging
choreographers to present.  Damara Ganley and Ami Student explore the
relationship of cultural and personal fragmentation through the lens
of post-holocaust Jewish American heritage.  Michelle Lynch
investigates the space in between intimacy and distance.  Andrew Wass
presents the internal negotiation and struggle between desire and
duty.  Catherine Galasso studies female hysteria and its
transcendence. Lesley Braithwaite presents a character solo somewhere
between the lofty Pavlova and Calamity Jane.  Abby Neitlich Rappoport
and Cara DeFabio engage the audience to interpret and question the
tension and comedy of the End of Times.


Hope to see you there!

Hughey's work is centered around perception, and much of its power
comes from her way of abusing perception and toying with the reader to get
a reaction: comic, tragic, or just startlingly peculiar.

Robins' poems are tight, precise accounts of an internal world,
understated, affectionate, and powerful.

Janke's are kinetic rambles through the innards of a rat in a neurology
lab and ending in the stars.

here is a new piece: http://vispo.com/nio/pens/springs5.htm

best to go full screen (F11 key) if you can.

the piece consists of about 20 animations. only four of which are visible,
at any time. the four that are visible, at a given moment, are, as it were,
attached by elastic springs to wherever you click and drag. so when you
click and drag, you drag the animations around via springs. that would be
more obvious if the objects you drag were not animations.

every now and then the screen is made black and it continues from where it
left off, except each 'nib' of the pen gets a different animation.

a poem of algorithms and animations.

an animism.

CA et.al,

I loved CA's response to 300 and his anecdote--I hope you're collecting your stories for print! they're among the richest things that this list has produced of late.  The whole debate over "300" is important (as long as we have it with others who feel otherwise), because these cultural productions clearly do function to grease the wheels of military imperium--as kitschy and over-the-top as "300" is.  CA's story actually reminded me of the debate that I discuss in "Behind the Lines" regarding ways to resist war.  On the one hand,  representations themselves have a imitative (even infective power), which means that merely "representing the horrors of war" can often incite further imitations of it.  On the other hand, a representation that enacts, as Zizek calls it, "living through the fantasy" (i.e. the s/m scenario perhaps), can be a way of defusing or subverting its power.  Zize always references some metal band from Eastern Europe who would employ fascist iconography and cos
t!

M'Work

There are certain misapprehensions in relation to my works in various
fields - music, sound, photography, film, video, texts, media in general.
I am assumed to be a producer bypassed or deflected, that my work refuses
steadfastly one genre or another. In fact, I neither produce masterpieces
nor specific works, and am uncomfortable with the thinking that references
a litany of key objects in my career. Instead, I construct discourses,
albeit with myself - discourses of such a nature that it seems irrelevant
to complete those things that might complete a career - a series for
example, or critical moments. I insist on discourse, because this is the
means of progress, of thinking itself; to stop at the wayside of this or
that thing cluttering up the environment means a waste of energy and a
good deal of the limited time we are all given in the first place. As far
as funding is concerned, I believe that such thought, such discourse,
should be rewarded in particular by granting agencies or good samaritans,
since there is little change of sales or recompense for the creation of
working-through streams of thought occasionally resulting in partial
reconstructions of philosophy, phenomenology, or any other and all modes
of conceiving the world. What is the world, but scaffolding which
constantly is renewed, destroyed, forgotten, abandoned at death, crudely
stumbled upon at birth? To examine this world, to truly occasion studies
and thinking without compromise, I am forced to forgo stases, strange and
familiar attractors - forced to avoid these at all costs, however
seductive they might appear. This is not to say that I remain aloof from
the marketplace - only that I appear deeply unfit for it, and am forced to
search elsewhere for financial support. But everywhere I look, it is the
same story - give me the goods, and I might consider, on one level or
another, rewarding you - but nothing further. There are no gifts in this
life, but only exchanges, and even these come at high psychological cost.
I honestly try to acquiesce; it is useless, tawdry; nothing seems to come
of it - something in my character. Given this, I plod onward, carrying my
sickness with me and an insane desire to believe that reward exists
somewhere through the journey itself, rather than the destination alone.
However, the thrust of this memo is elsewhere - a counter to those who
critique my working as a contamination of site, cite, and sight - those
who are blind not to see value in the difficult motion of thinking among
the ongoing world. This is what I do; I think, give signposts, memoranda,
exempla, and inhabitants of the imaginary, and this, I believe, is the
goal and guise of the true artist, never to rest, never to complete what
is already known, but to search out elsewhere for whatever knowledge might
be gained along the ways.

Susan: "bugged by certain quarters for unclear poetry i took an unclear
poem ..." -- it took me a second read to realize you weren't
implementing some beautiful extended metaphor about grocery shopping &
difficult poetry... was this an unclear poem you'd run across, or was it
one of your own that someone had labeled "unclear"? in other words, was
it a published piece (therefore in some sense "accepted" into
publication) or something in embryo you were working on?

my abiding problem with Robert Pinsky: I want to like him, since he's so
energetic and positive about poetry in the world (at least that's his
shtick), but he always seems to choose the path squarely down the middle
in any argument about poetics -- maybe this is what an excellent
popularizer does, a la Keillor & co.=20

purveyors of easy poetry speak to a large swath of people... honestly,
I'm delighted when I hear the "Writers Almanac" on the radio, since it's
often the only time I'll hear *any* poetry in the course of my day, at
least from the mainstream squawk-box... "easy" poetry is easily sold to
its readers, and its wide audience can consume it for its soothing
quality -- functional in the same way new age/muzak "calms" frayed
nerves -- no rough edges.

but what's to be done with the unmentioned, truly "difficult" work that
nobody with the national prominence of Keillor or Pinsky will address?=20

as Catherine pointed out, Pinsky's "examples aren't particularly
challenging poems...[and] he leaves some open questions about what
'difficult' is".=20

I was disappointed, too -- I thought in this article I was going to see
Pinsky challenge poetry that was more remote from popular. instead,
Pinsky's article chose some pieces that are difficult in a mainstream,
high school English class sort of way (argue if you think this is an
unfair characterization), but largely they are poems *about* being
difficult, not works that *are* difficult. the pieces are easily
comprehended if you "get" what the authors were up to, what the key
tells you if you look at your teacher's edition of the anthology.

this takes me back to my junior college English class, where we spent 45
minutes twisting on the teacher's fork over what Robert Graves' "Down,
wanton, down!" is about, before he (the teacher) spluttered with lewd
delight: "it's a penis!!"

does the key to every poem exist? do we want a key to exist? is a poem
difficult if finding its "key" is impossible on the first read? is a
poem easy if the "key" is left under the doormat? etc. (my take on
postmodern interpretation accepts keyless entry as a valid option.)

"why don't you write something nice?" as my mother used to say...=20

Ray Hsu ::: Tung-Hui Hu ::: Reb Livingston ::: Rebecca Loudon ::: Marc McKee
::: Kathleen Rooney & Elisa Gabbert ::: Craig Morgan Teicher ::: Samuel
Wharton ::: Sarah Wolfson

#1 First Lines:
Say I say animal machine, would it make ::: The teenager's prosthetic limbs
get stolen. ::: the vein in your throat candle blackbody ::: (it felt like
an experiment at first) ::: Birds swing into the milk ::: were writing
letters. Me or you, ::: There is a bruise to your breath, my love, that I
swear you ::: He will want the vulture. He will put on a cotton button-down
::: My ghost walks through the door ::: Who become the parents of the
trespassing ::: A perfect apple exists outside the realm of sense. :::
Recalling a symbolism once fixed and familiar, ::: Just inside the petting
zoo the little goats ::: He writes the usual from Brazil. I know the place
::: The sweat of him ::: All over. Meaning lost or gone. A local idiom that
speaks ::: People who call high school the best years ::: Parachute silk,
iron ore, gasoline, ::: As if they would allow the star ::: The homeless man
is in love with me.

Hi Susan.  Some of my favorite poems are poems I don't completely understand.  I've told my students not to be afraid or dismissive of poetry they don't understand.  If a poem has a beauty to it which can be intuitively stirring, it needn't necessarily be completely understood.  There are poems by Robert Duncan, for instance, which I've loved for many years without completely understanding them.  As for Pinsky, I just read a beautiful translation he did of a poem Michelangelo wrote in his old age.  So Pinsky has the right idea sometimes.  I've also seen and heard some of his own poetry which was pretty good.  Regards, Tom Savage

it is free at the library; most of my online students used library access --
some took courses online because they couldn't afford
paper/printing/xeroxing (15 cents a page in our library? I think)
for assignments; one hopes that some of the Gates education/election money
goes towards making internet education information more readily available

npr said 5M more people below poverty line here than in 2000 -- who knows
what the real figures are, tho

the US government no longer makes it easy for people to access food stamps,
the earned income credit, and other programs, so the real suffering is
somewhat greater than this would indicate

"the poverty line" has unfortunately never been adjusted for the price of
food falling relative to the cost of housing and it is "location
independent" meaning the income is one adult, 3 kids @ 23K? ish? it is some
silly figure which is far more than a full time job at minimum wage earns,
and is the same amount whether you're in a major city or somewhere with a
lower cost of living

All,

So here I am looking at a huge stack of chapbooks & working on the next
review column for Rain Taxi & not that I'm in any way in want of even more
chapbooks but can't help feeling like there are more of these things out
there that I'm missing & that it might be a good time to just float a small
reminder to any one who might have or might be putting out a new chapbook
that the Rain Taxi column is indeed an ongoing thing & it'd be wonderful to
have a chance to consider anything folks might have for inclusion in the
column which as it's housed in a magazine with huge distribution might offer
one the change to have one's work or I suppose mention of one's work reach
outside of those normal channels & I wonder if I should just keep going with
this sentence...

So, send me yr chapbooks...

Following Rules: An Oulipian Reading with Harry Mathews & Doug Nufer

Born in New York in 1930, Harry Mathews settled in Europe in 1952 and has
since then lived in Spain, Germany, Italy, and (chiefly) France. In 1978 he
returned to the United States to teach for several years at Bennington
College, Columbia University, and the New School University. Now married to
the French writer Marie Chaix, he divides his time between Paris and Key
West. When Mathews published his first poems in 1956, he was associated wit=
h
the so-called New York School of poets, with three of whom (John Ashbery,
Kenneth Koch, James Schuyler) he founded the review Locus Solus in 1961.
Through his friendship with Georges Perec, he became a member of the Oulipo
in 1972. The author of six novels and several collections of poetry, his
most recent publications are Sainte Catherine, a novella written in French
(=C9ditions P.O.L, 2000), The Human Country: the Collected Short Stories
(Dalkey Archive Press, 2002), The Case of the Persevering Maltese: Collecte=
d
Essays (Dalkey Archive Press, 2003), Oulipo Compendium (co-edited with
Alastair Brotchie; Atlas Press and Make Now Press, 2005), and My Life in
CIA: A Chronicle of 1973 (Dalkey Archive Press, 2005). Doug Nufer writes
works of fiction and poetry and pieces for performance that seem to follow
odd procedures, even when they don't. His novels include Never Again,
Negativeland, and most recently, a double novel, The Mudflat Man/ The River
Boys. His fiction and/or poetry has appeared in Chain, Fence, Monkey Puzzle=
,
Bird Dog, and The Golden Handcuffs Review. He also performs his work with
choreographer Erin Mitchell and her dance troupe (he speaks/ they dance). H=
e
lives in Seattle, where he runs a wine shop.

Anyone involved with FACEBOOK please read this!
The group "ArabLBTG" is on the verge of being SHUT DOWN
because the Saudi, Egyptian, Kuwaiti and Emirati governments
are insisting that FACEBOOK not allow any queer FACEBOOK
groups which mention, or having anything to do with citizens
of their countries.

Anyone who is a member of FACEBOOK and would like me
to send the link to vote against, and tell FACEBOOK to back
down, please write to me VERY SOON!  Timing is everything,
as this is literally on the verge of happening.  Our swift,
collective actions against this are needed!  Contact me at
CAConrad13@aol.com  NOW, BELOW are some of the
discussions and info from the petition page:

(THIS IS THE DISCUSSION I AM REFERRING TO)
 Violating terms of conduct
Between You and Adminstrator Josh
Adminstrator Josh

10:15am April 24th
Report MessageDear Subscriber,

You have violated the terms of conduct you agreed upon when you signed up
with Facebook.com. Your violations fall in the following criteria:

1. Advertising\spam, you have posted in the group advertisements concerning
a website. You do have the right to refer to websites but not advertise
them.

2. Creating a global group that is not allowed in some regions. Your group
"Arab LBTGAY(Lesbian,bisexual,transexual and gay)" has put facebook in
trouble as we received an official complaint from the Saudi government, the
Egyptian government and other Arab governments that do not want to be
mentioned.

Your Group must be shut down or a new Group with a specified network other
than the two mentioned may be created. We are very sorry as we support any
group but the countries mentioned are threatening to block our server from
their side, therefore please comply.

Thank you for understanding
The Facebook Team

4:15pm April 25th
hey i have a question. i understand it says it must be shut down but is it
possible to make it a"closed group" or i have to make it a secret?

Adminstrator Josh

5:25pm April 25th
Report MessageWell, If you turn it into a closed group you must be more than
sure that no Saudis or Egyptians join the group. This is very hard, but if
you chose to do this we do not mind.

In case of chosing to close the group you will have to kick any Saudi,
Egyptian, Kuwaiti or even Emirati that happens to join or we pick out for
you. Is that fair enough?

The Facebook Team
-------------

(AND THIS IS FROM THE PETITION PAGE)
 The official Petition to prevent Arab LBTG from being shut down.

Dear Facebook users:

We represent the group "ArabLBTG". We are posting this as a plea for your
support in an act of resistance against Facebook's request of shutting down
the group because they have received several complaints from particular Arab
governments. If we do not shut down the group, according to Facebook, we
have to make it a closed group that excludes specific Arab citizens, such as
Saudi and Egyptian. This is not conducive to a queer-positive Facebook
environment, but an exclusivist, discriminatory, racist environment that
threatens our right to free speech.

We would like to encourage everyone to contact Facebook and reject their
oppressive, homophobic request towards a specific minority of the queer
community.

Thank you for all your support
In hopes of victory,

ArabLBTG Admin

we're only "at war" according to our own definition of "war," since war is
with another country, not with "terror," "drugs," "crime," etc.  they want
us to believe we are muscularly and gallantly "at war," whereas we are
actually waging terrorism against the civilian populations of other
countries.  thanks for sending this info about the news conglomerates.
i'll broadcast it about.  goes well with bill moyers' program last night.

In an environment where the Iraqi (i.e. U.S.) government refuses to provide the UN with data concening
the numbers and nature of civilian deaths, Iraq experiences a cumulative Virginia Tech on a nearly weekly basis and has done so nearly every week for longer than we were involved in WWII.

When the media speaks of things like the "worst peacetime ..." when need to remember that on 9/11/2001 we were at peace and we need to parenthetically insert "civilian-inflicted" into most of the statements to make the word "worst" more accurate. How many were killed by the FBI & ATF in the Branch Davidian fiasco at Waco?

At the risk of crossing streams, "facism" and "fascinate" share the same root.

Greetings friends.  I wanted to let you know that we are currently accepting proposals for Articulations, an event organized by Graduate Students in the Theatre Department at the University of Minnesota and open to scholars, students and artists from a variety of disciplines. This will not be your usual "conference" setting, but an interaction with city spaces and a variety of disciplines that we hope will yield some interesting conversations, new thinking and will result in the publication of a journal.

Below is the CFP, minus the ever important Robert Wilson drawing referenced therein, as the list doesn't take attachments.  If you want to see the actual CFP page, please email me at fluffysingler@earthlink.net and I'll send it to you.

Cheers.


ARTICULATIONSentrance

Call For Participants...

Places chosen for their visual quality: light, darkness, views, angles, curves, text. Places chosen for the sounds or silences they produced or that are produced within/around them. Robert Wilson said it best when he offered this image:

Consider this sketch by Robert Wilson. Wilson uses the tricks of perspective to draw the eye into the space he is sketching. As we look forward into the corridor our oblique vision captures images on the periphery, but the periphery is blurry and undefined. Wilson represents this with his black, squiggly lines. The caption at the bottom and the empty space figure off center to the right suggest the activity of the scene: entrance. The empty space figure is entering that abstract site and we as viewers are called to inhabit that empty space and enter the scene as well. Our entrance activates the space. The idea is to create an experience in/at the site without prescribed notions of what that intervention or experience will be. The world is in the object. The site is a citation of the unthought.

Articulations 2007, taking place on October 12 and 13, will experiment with the act of entrance and attempt to investigate the resulting violence of intervention.  We will grapple with, face, grasp at, take on, and struggle through the act of entrance at multiple sites scattered throughout the Twin Cities.

The conference comes into being through the doing of it. It is a conference because performers and scholars with specific skills are called together to perform or enact their individual ways of thinking. It is a workshop in that people convene at a site and work through a specific challenge. In this case, the challenge is to interact with the site and to act within the site.

Please send a short C.V. (no more than two pages) and a 250-word statement in which you describe your research interests and how you believe they correspond to the goals of this conference, as well as any disability accommodations, to George McConnell at Articulations2007@gmail.com by May 30, 2007.

"THE DARKEST PLACES IN HELL ARE RESERVED FOR
THOSE WHO MAINTAINED THEIR NEUTRALITY IN TIMES
OF MORAL CRISIS."  --Dante

Thanks to all of you who back-channeled.  Let me say very
openly here that I disagree that it's not FACEBOOK's fault.
In fact it's FACEBOOK's giving into, with such ease mind you,
policies of fascism (fascism is our word for the week it seems)
that bind both FACEBOOK and these Arab governments
into one.

The tricky thing is that FACEBOOK tries to make this look
like they're being helpful, that they're sorry.  Isn't that sweet?
I mean, it's clear, always clear where these governements
stand on the topic of homosexuality since they behead and
publicly hang homosexuals.  But FACEBOOK wants to appear
the victim.  Well they're NOT!  And by giving in, FACEBOOK
is making the Arab LBTG group the victim.

But ask yourselves this:  If FACEBOOK were asked to shut
down a women's group, or other religious or ethnic group
because these particular governments were unhappy with
their own citizens communicating with them, don't you think
that FACEBOOK would have stood their ground?

Not for one second do I believe FACEBOOK would have
dared agree so easily to shut down other groups.  This is
pure and simple homophobia at work.  Homosexuals are
taking the back-seat once again because of archaic
beliefs that homosexuality is a choice.

The moderator of the Arab LBTG group was right-on when
writing, "We would like to encourage everyone to contact
Facebook and reject their oppressive, homophobic request
towards a specific minority of the queer community."
Meaning pointing the finger at FACEBOOK.

It's not okay, not okay for even a moment for FACEBOOK
to act like their hands are tied.  If indeed they stand behind
free speech, this is their test, and they're failing it.  In my
opinion they've ALREADY FAILED the test for the fact that
they even consider asking the Arab LBTG group to dissolve,
or worse yet, give into a system of profiling Arab members.

But in the age of THE PATRIOT ACT, this sort of situation
seems lukewarm to some.  Well it's not.  It's something we
need to meet head-on, and support this group.

Please consider getting involved.  You don't have to do much
more than join the group.  The growing number of people
joining this group will be enough to MAKE the "FACEBOOK
TEAM" understand their errors.  But this does need to
happen soon, as it's all about to take place, this censorship.

Dearest All,

A friend is putting together a panel of people who have gotten (or are
undertaking)
the MFA/PhD (Creative Writing). If you're interested, please email him.
I've posted
his announcement below. He rec'd his MFA at Chicago & is at Albany in PhD
Poetics
program. He's author of _The Definition of Place_, just out from Main
Street Rag.


Begin announcment:

With PhD Creative Writing programs beginning to emerge in more and more
universities, and the noticeable addition of "MFA, PhD Preferred" to most
listings of academic jobs for creative writers, more MFA'ers are  feeling
the pressure to obtain the doctorate in order to compete in today's
academic job market. This panel will feature PhD students who possess a
MFA, and they will explore the pros and cons of the PhD curriculum after
the MFA. The panel will also address how the PhD affects their writing
aesthetic, and will ultimately analyze if this route is best for the
creative writer.

6. Cautions

--------------------------------------------

Above the world-weary horizons
New obstacles for exchange arise
Or unfold,
O ye postmasters!


1. About the Poetics List

With the preceding epigraph, the Poetics Listserv was founded by
Charles Bernstein in late 1993. Now in its fourth incarnation, the
list has over 1300 subscribers worldwide. We also have a substantial
number of nonsubscribing readers, who access the list through our web
site (see archive URL above).

The Poetics List is not a forum for a general discussion of poetry or
for the exchange of poems. Our aim is to support, inform, and extend
those directions in poetry that are committed to innovations,
renovations, and investigations of form and/or/as content, to the
questioning of received forms and styles, and to the creation of the
otherwise unimagined, untried, unexpected, improbable, and impossible.
While we recognize that other lists may sponsor other possibilities
for exchange, we request that those participating in this forum keep
in mind the specialized and focused nature of this project and respect
our decision to operate a moderated list. The Poetics List exists to
support and encourage divergent points of view on innovative forms of
modern and contemporary poetry and poetics, and we are committed to do
what is necessary to preserve this space for such dialog.

Due to the high number of subscribers, we no longer maintain the open
format with which the list began (at under 100 subscribers). The
specific form of moderation that we employ is a relatively fluid one:
in most cases, messages are reviewed after having been posted to the
list, and difficulties resolved on that basis; however, the listserv
editorial board may shift between this and a pre-review mode which
calls for all messages to be read and approved before being forwarded
to the list. We prefer to avoid this option as it hampers the
spontaneity of discussion that we hope to promote. In addition to
these options, the editorial board will unsubscribe individuals if
they are not, in our opinion, productively contributing to the list or
following our guidelines. We remain committed to this editorial
function as a defining element of the Poetics List.

Please also note that this is a not a general interest poetry list and
information about this list should not be posted to directories of
poetry lists. The idea is to keep the list membership to those with
specific engagement related to the list's stated orientation. The
current limits of the list are 75 messages per day, and a maximum of
four messages per subscriber per day; but these limits are subject to
change withouth notice.

In addition to being archived at through the EPC
(http://epc.buffalo.edu) and at
http://listserv.acsu.buffalo.edu/archives/poetics.html, some posts to
Poetics (especially reviews, obituary notices, announcements, etc.)
may also become part of specific EPC subject areas.

Note also that Roof Books published Joel Kuszai's edited collection of
the Poetics List; this is available from ROOF and also on line at the
EPC.


2. Posting to the List

The Poetics List is a moderated list. All messages are reviewed by the
editors in keeping with the goals of the list as articulated in this
Welcome Message (see section 1).

Please note that while this list is primarily concerned with
discussions of poetry and poetics, messages relating to politics and
political activism, film, art, media, and so forth are also welcome.
We strongly encourage subscribers to post information, including web
links, relating to publications (print and internet), reading series,
and blogs that they have coordinated, edited, published, or in which
they appear. Such announcements constitute a core function of this
list. Brief reviews of poetry events and publications (print or
digital) are always welcome.

We generally do not accept postings of creative work not directed
toward a discussion of poetics issues on the list. The Poetics List is
not a venue for the posting of free-standing, personal poems or
journal entries. However, the Poetics List editor may occasionally
solicit or approve poems for posting on the list.

Also, please note that the Poetics List is not a "chat" list and we
discourage the posting of  very short messages intended for only a few
subscribers.

All posts go out not only to list subscribers but also become a public
part of the list archive on the web. Note that posting to the list is
a form of publication and that by sending your message to the list you
formally consent to such web publication. Posts are currently being
indexed by search engines such as Google. It is not possible for us to
remove posts from the list archive or to control search engine
indexing of these posts.

Subscribers only may post to the Poetics List. Send messages directly
to the list address: poetics@listserv.buffalo.edu.


3. Subscriptions

*For all subscription requests go to
http://listserv.acsu.buffalo.edu/archives/poetics.html.

*To subscribe for the first time click on "Subscribe (join) a List."
Immediately following your subscription to the poetics listserv we ask
that you email poetics@buffalo.edu, subject-line "registration," with
your full name, street address, email address, and telephone number.
Failure to register at the time of subscription will result in
automatic deletion from the subscription roll.

*To manage your subscription (for descriptions of the different
subscription options please see section 3), click on "Subscriber's
Corner."

Subscriptions to the Poetics List are free of charge, but formal
registration is required. All other questions about subscriptions,
whether about an individual subscription or subscription policy,
should be addressed to this same administrative address.

PLEASE NOTE: All subscription-related information and correspondence
remains absolutely confidential.

All posts to the list must provide your full real name, as registered.
If there is any discrepancy between your full name as it appears in
the "from" line of the message header, please sign your post at the
bottom. Subscribers who do not include their full name with each post
will be unsubscribed form the list.

The most frequent problem with subscriptions is bounced messages. If
your system is often down or if you have a low disk quota, Poetics
messages may get bounced, which will result in your subscription being
automatically terminated by the Listserv program and the automatically
generated message telling you that this has occurred will also likely
bounce. If this happens, you may re-subscribe to the list by the same
process described above. One remedy to avoid this happening in the
future: set your list options to "no-mail" and read the list on the
web.

4. Subscription Options

We encourage you to alter your subscription options via the link on
the right side of the screen at
http://listserv.acsu.buffalo.edu/archives/poetics.html. If you would
prefer not to use the web-interface, you may also email
<listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu> the following commands:

*to subscribe to the Poetics listserv send
listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu this one-line message with no "subject":
sub poetics [your Firstname and Lastname]

*RECOMMENDED: if you wish to read the list on our web interface and
not receive any messages sent directly, while remaining subscribed to
the list and so eligible to send us posts, send this one-line message
to <listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu> with no "subject": set poetics
nomail. Note: this option is also useful for temporary suspension of
email service.

*to reactivate Poetics e-mail send <listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu>
this one-line message with no "subject": set poetics mail

* to receive the list in digest form (you will receive the day's
individual posts in one email sent just after midnight EST), send
<listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu> this one-line message with no
"subject": set poetics digest

*to receive posts in the default option (you will receive individual
postings immediately), send <listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu> this one-
line message with no "subject": set poetics nodigest

* to receive the list in index form (you will receive a list, without
the text of the posts, of the subjects discussed each day along with
the author's name and address and the number of lines it comprises;
you can also choose to have the index sent to you in either plain text
or in HTML format with hyperlinks), send
<listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu> this one-line message with no
"subject": set poetics nohtml index --or-- set poetics html index

PLEASE NOTE: do not leave your Poetics subscription in default or
digest mode if you are going to be away for any extended period of
time. Your account may become flooded and you may lose Poetics
messages as well as other important mail. In such cases, switch your
subscription to "nomail" as recommended above.

5. To Unsubscribe

To unsubscribe (or change any of your subscription options), again, we
strongly encourage you to go to the right-hand side of the screen at
http://listserv.acsu.buffalo.edu/archives/poetics.html You may also
may unsubscribe by sending a one-line email to
<listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu> with no "subject": unsub poetics

If you are having difficulty unsubscribing, please note: sometimes
your e-mail address may be changed slightly by your system
administrator. If this happens you will not be able to send messages
to Poetics or to unsubscribe, although you will continue to receive
mail from the Poetics List. To avoid this problem, unsub using your
old address, then resubscribe with your new email address.


6. Cautions

"Flame" messages will not be tolerated on the Poetics List. We define
'flaming' as any post that resembles a personal attack or personal
insult to anyone--subscriber or not. This of course includes racist,
sexist, or other slurs as well as ad hominem arguments in which the
person rather than their work is attacked; in other words while
critique of a person's work is welcome (critical inquiry is one of the
main functions of the list), this critique cannot extend to a critique
or criticism of the person.

The listserv is intended to be a productive communal space for
discussion and announcements; as such, subscribers who do not follow
listserv policy will be removed from the subscription roll.

In enforcing this policy, the editors must consider sometimes
competing interests. The basis for our decisions, however, rests with
our collective judgment about the kind of space we want for the list.

For reasons of basic security, we do not allow pseudonymous
subscriptions. All messages intended for the Poetics List should be
sent in Text-Only format, without attachments. We do not accept
HTML-formatted messages or attached files. As a general rule, keep
individual posts to 1,000 words or less.

Please do not publish list postings without the express permission of
the author. Posting on the list is a form of publication. Copyright
for all material posted on Poetics remains with the author; material
from this list and its archive may not be reproduced without the
author's permission, beyond the standard rights accorded by "fair use"
of published materials.

All material on the Poetics List remains the property of the authors;
before you reproduce this material, in whole or in part, we ask that
you get permission (by email is fine) from the authors. If they give
permission, then we ask only that you say that the post or posts
appeared originally on the Poetics List
(http://epc.buffalo.edu/poetics/welcome.html) on [give date and say:]
Used by permission of the author.

As an outside maximum, we will accept no more than 4 messages per day
from any one subscriber. Also, given that our goal is a manageable
list (manageable both for moderators and subscribers), the list
accepts 75 or fewer messages per day, though these paramenters may be
changed at the discretion of the list moderator.

Like all systems, the listserv will sometimes be down: if you feel
your message has been delayed or lost, *please wait at least one day
to see if it shows up*, then check the archive to be sure the message
is not posted there; if you still feel there is a problem, you may
wish to contact the editors at <poetics.list@gmail.com>.

I can't really come down on easy poetry per se because I doubt that very
many people get into poetry any other way.  We all started somewhere and
lots of people are at the very beginning when it comes to poetry,
including many English teachers who are in it for the fiction.

However, this discussion has given me a simple thought:  wouldn't it be
great if Ted Kooser's weekly column and Keiller's radio thing presented
two poems each time...one easy and one that's a little more challenging.
It would be particularly useful in print with the option for re-reading.

There is now a Facebook group called, "The official Petition to prevent Arab LBTG from being shut down."  (Thanks, Jordan!)  ---->

http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=2373716526


Name:The official Petition to prevent Arab LBTG from being shut down.
Type:Common Interest - Beliefs & Causes
Description:Dear Facebook users:

We represent the group "ArabLBTG". We are posting this as a plea for your support in an act of resistance against Facebook's request of shutting down the group because they have received several complaints from particular Arab governments. If we do not shut down the group, according to Facebook, we have to make it a closed group that excludes specific Arab citizens, such as Saudi and Egyptian. This is not conducive to a queer-positive Facebook environment, but an exclusivist, discriminatory, racist environment that threatens our right to free speech.

We would like to encourage everyone to contact Facebook and reject their oppressive, homophobic request towards a specific minority of the queer community:

Thank you for all your support
In hopes of victory,

ArabLBTG Admin

my experience with poetry was the opposite: junior year HS English
teacher tells us to pick a poem or work of short fiction and write a
research paper on it -- we can pick anything, *except* The Waste Land
(too difficult, too much of a turn-off for young minds, said Mr.
Albertazzi). of course I picked the forbidden fruit just to flout his
commandment, and made off with an A before I was kicked out of Eden (or
Placer Cty. -- my sense of geography remains vague to this day).

so I guess I've always seen difficulty or ease of reception of poetry as
a state of mind, not something concrete.

nevertheless, yeah, something sweet and charming is called for to entice
those not willing to be pummeled with strangeness. the ones looking for
a challenge won't need PR campaigns, I would assume.

compare with classical composers: is Mozart easy and is Charles Ives
difficult? there are some gnarly sections in Mozart's corpus, and Ives
has a lot of elegant, "easy-on-the-ear" pieces... perhaps this indicates
a false dichotomy?=20

I think the challenge new music presents to us, especially in the
Ivesian tradition, is to look at everything as new. If someone's
doing genre work very straight-up, coming at it from listening to
Ives, or John Zorn or Christian Marclay, I'm inclined to say "what's
that genre doing here"? The criterion for me then is not if
something's new, but if looking at it in that way, in the way of
wondering why it is as it is, produces an interesting listen or read.
"New" work rewards looking at what about it is momentous, "old" work
does not. If I read Bernstein's last new book of poetry and ask
"what's he developing, what's he up to" I think I'll get more
interesting answers than if I do the same with Philip Levine's (even
though I like both poets).

Thanks, Peter and Gretchen.

I went to the drug store today for some well never mind. Additionally, I
usually visit the computers section (toy division) of the drug store. They
sell Macs and PCs. I use a PC; don't have a Mac. So the drug store is my Mac
division for testing my work. Of course they also sell Windows machines with
Vista on them, so I see how my work functions under Vista. That's a bit of
an issue these days because I write with Director, and it's kind of
slipping.

I see that 'Spring Poem' looks way different on the Macs, and way different
on PCs with wide monitors. I'll have to fix those problems.

On the Mac, the colors are quite different. Also, currently I'm adjusting
the size of the animations only according to the browser width. My monitor
is 1280x1024. But the monitors in the drugstore are all considerably wider.
Though not higher. So I'll have to size the animations based both on width
and height. Otherwise, the animations are too large and the thing doesn't
behave or look very good. On my monitor at home, 'Spring Poem' suggests
shapes as it sketches. When the animations are too big, the sketches don't
suggest shape so readily. The 'pen' is too wide and high to suggest shapes
with its incremental sketching.

Also, there's some sort of problem with the code of the springs physics
after quite a while. Boing boing boing all over the place too fast. A code
bug of some sort.

Have been fiddling with various parameters I'd like to let the wreader
adjust. Like the animation size. Also, Director has 'inks'. Copy, background
transparent, ghost, not ghost, reverse, not reverse, add pin, subtract,
darken, lighten, multiply, screen, and so on. A few of these look quite
different than the usual. Also, would like to let the wreader adjust the
background color. And the transparency of the animations.

It turns out it isn't too hard to let wreaders import their own Photoshop or
Flash or bitmap files. So eventually I'd like to support that. Mind you, I
find that with most of my stuff, I have all sorts of ideas for interesting
features, as I develop it, but can't implement all of my ideas. And have to
move on at a certain point.

The main idea in "Spring Poem" was to implement a software 'pen' that
consists of various 'nibs' that each hold an image or an animation. I first
saw this in CorelPaint around 1998; I used CorelPaint to make
http://vispo.com/I/ThePen.html and
http://vispo.com/pornomorphs/SexGoddess.html . The Pornomorphs also used a
symmetry tool; the Pornomorphs were just body parts without the symmetry
tool; the symmetry tool turned them into bodies.

I thought it'd be cool to try to make a 'pen' where the 'nibs' were all
attached to the main 'pen' via springs. I looked around and found some Lingo
code by Danny Kodicek that implements springs in 'simple harmonic motion'. I
have a few books that describe the physics, which I'm pondering somewhat
cluelessly. But I don't need to understand the physics to use Kodicek's
implementation of the physics.

The springs are quite long in 'Spring Poem'. You don't see tight motion
around where you click. The springs are loose and long. I'd also like to let
the wreader adjust the length of the springs. And their springyness,
yadayada.

The basic idea is of a 'pen' that sketches visual poems from language.
Either by itself or with the wreader's input.

Once I develop the piece a bit further, I'll post an updated link. Thanks
for your interest.

I know of a poet from out of town who's maybe coming to NY and would like to
put in a reading http://www.icorn.org/articles.php?var=52

I'm Danish. My new collection of poetry, "We Are Here", is published in
Toronto
http://www.bookthug.ca/miva/merchant.mvc?Screen=PROD&Store_Code=apollinaire&Product_Code=2427&Category_Code=BT2006B.

I’m invited for literary festivals in Canada Sept.- Oct.; the program is:
THIN AIR, the Winnipeg International Writers Festival, Sept. 23-30
http://www.winnipegwords.com/about_us.html
Calgary International Writers Festival, Oct. 9th-14th.
http://www.wordfest.com/media_facts.php
Vancouver International Writers Festival, Oct. 16 – 21
http://www.writersfest.bc.ca/

As you see there are some free days 1th-8th Oct. after THIN AIR.  It will
also be possible to do a reading late in October - after Writersfest in
Vancouver.

If this is in your interest I would be happy to go down to NY for a reading
or two.

Best,

"In Custody" might interest many from this list.....its about a forgotten,
sick and ageing Urdu (Islamic) poet,
brilliantly played by Shashi Kapoor, taut and stressed by the daily quarrels
between his two wives,
on whom he is destined to depend for the rest of his life. Poetry and
nostalgia apart, the film focusses on the mysterious and altercating
relationship between the two women.

Riverbend, the otherwise anonymous author of Baghdad Burning - certainly one
of the best, if not the best voices - speaking from the burnt core of this
Bush-Cheney-Rumsfeld-Rice-Wolfolitz-Blair, etc. produced war monstrosity has
left Baghdad along with the other members of her family.  No doubt the
inevitable consequence of barely surviving with 'dire straits.'
Her last piece has just recently gone up on her blog site. I know I will
probably not alone in missing her sense of intimate contact, involvement and
caustic analysis of and with the day to day reality of state of that City.

Hi everyone,

Just letting yall know that my new poetry book MY ANGIE DICKINSON is out fr=
om Zasterle Press and now available at Small Press Distribution:

***************************************

In Michael Magee=E2=80=99s cyber-quatrains, two Dickinsons =E2=80=93 Police=
 Woman and the Belle of Amherst =E2=80=93 meet in the depths of the interne=
t=E2=80=A6and what a perfect pair they make! Employing an oulipo-esque Goog=
le procedure, Magee channels the poetic line through the window of a search=
 engine. His contextual ruptures and pop snippets accumulate and resonate ,=
 continually surprise. My Angie Dickinson is an obsessive, innovative, and =
exciting work.

--David Trinidad

Fifty years from now, when people are writing without irony of "the classic=
s of flarf," one of the works that will turn up on that relatively short li=
st will be Michael Magee's My Angie Dickinson =E2=80=A6brilliant, hilarious=
, deeply conceived, completely serious, with more twists than a pretzel fac=
tory, well written, but still thoroughly flarf. Just for good measure, My A=
ngie Dickinson is also the most ambitious production, design wise, Zasterle=
 has yet attempted. This book is a joy.

Alan,

Absolutely scary!

Do you remember in Kubrick's 2001, one of the astronauts is almost lost
outside the ship, and the ship goes after it. The astronaut looks so near
through the glass (but it is frighteningly far, in another dimension) and
the ship has to take very complicated steps, maneuvers, to reach it?

Is the little figure what you call avatar, the correspondent of "I" in the
web?

Does your piece go on forever, perhaps it should?

Ciao,

Murat

Not only goes on forever, but goes on beneath the surface, above the
surface; there's no respect for boundary. It's almost like filming real
life - camera angles are incredibly important and difficult...

Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; format=flowed

All,

Since I've gotten numerous backchannel inquires, rather than retype &
reiterate individually the same info, I figure it might be of some use for
me to simply post here the information:

If you're interested in having your chapbook considered for review in Rain
Taxi's ongoing chapbook review column, read on:

1) All chapbooks must carry publication dates of 2007, as I finished the
final batch from 06 this weekend.

2) Although one might make a valid argument as to what constitutes a
chapbook, which is fine, and which might be an interesting discussion, I
personally won't consider work that approaches the 50 page mark, nor
broadsheets or broadsides, unless these are folded in such a way as to
create several pages of text.

3) The chapbooks must be "in print" at the time of publication of the
mention. If you do chapbooks in runs of say 15 copies, that's great, rad, &
just what folks should be doing with chapbooks, but send 'em to yr pals &
other poets that you'd like to have read them...

4) I can not commit to reviewing anything sent my way, sorry.

5) Out of the hundreds of chapbooks from 2006 that I've read, if I were able
to give an award, say a crown, for the most exciting one, I would place it
on the head of Farid Matuk, as the chapbook __Is It The King?__ was the
single most exciting one I'd read last year. You should really pick it up
here: http://effingpress.com/

Okay, that's it.

best,
NEG

Here's my address again:

1014 E 10th Ave
Denver, CO 80218

(please call before you come over)

PS: I have two new books out, review copies of which I'd be happy to float
to anyone who'd like--just b/c me yr mailing address...

MAY DAY 2007:
CHICAGO IMMIGRATION MARCH

Join the march and rally for the unconditional
legalization for ALL!
Say NO to border walls and militarization of the
border!

TUESDAY, MAY 1st 2007
*10:00 AM – Rally in Union Park
[Ashland Ave. and Washington St .]
*1:30 PM – March on Washington St .
*3:00 PM – Rally in Daley Plaza
[Washington St. and Dearborn St.]

In 1886, Chicago immigrant workers lead and won the
fight for the 8-hour work day. Today, workers around
the world remember that struggle in May Day
commemorating the Haymarket Martyrs. One hundred and
twenty years later, immigrant workers are once again
leading the struggle for workers’ rights by demanding
the legalization, with full rights, of all
undocumented workers.

Dear GEORGE, hey there!
First, really?  In Philly the library is always filled with (no lie)
homeless people at many of the hundreds of computer
terminals with free Internet access.  It's great that this is
available, but the librarians now resent having to play
babysitter for the free access rooms, which I understand.
Not part of their Library Science degree, right?

And of course the library has suffered, meaning the
ACTUAL LIBRARY of the library, as though it's no
longer about books.  My favorite librarians are the
renegades who rescue books by sending them to
The Stacks for no-lend preservation.  This is because
otherwise these books (many of them poetry) would
be thrown out with the new city policy of getting rid
of books that do not circulate for a year.  When this
policy was first instituted I gathered my friends to
help check out random poetry books (of which there
were thousands, wonderful rare things, like the entire
catalog of Gil Orlovitz for instance, and rare German
poets like Hilda Domin (who is NOT (I'm annoyed to
see) in that new anthology of Modern German poets)
and many other things, OH, like Cid Corman's
GIST OF ORIGIN, but anyway) to keep them from
disappearing, which many had already.  There was
this marvelous book of poems by Philippe Joccottet
which, by the time I remembered it was on my list of
books to rescue, was already gone.

But this is really off the subject.  Oh, right, well George,
if you need me to send you my pay stubs, or something?
OR, if you or some of your rich friends (do you have
rich friends?) are interested, I'd really like to (would quite
seriously like to) start the Philadelphia Poetry Hotel.
Here's the link:
http://PoetryHotel.blogspot.com

And thanks so much for the interest George!
Can't wait for us to get started on the hotel!  OH and
George, if you help fund this we will name one of
the rooms The George Bowering Room.  How's that?
What color should we paint it?  Tangerine?  Violet?
How about Tangerine AND Violet?  Don't you think
Tangerine and Violet should always be written with
the upper case "T" and "V" George?  I believe so!
But we'll have a life-sized photograph of you on the
ceiling over the bed, how's that?  Clothing optional
for the photograph, your choice.  Or maybe you
could be wearing a green suit?  A green suit would
look nice in a Tangerine and Violet room, yes?

Halvard, thank you.

Chaucer also was a great admirer of Boccaccio, though maybe in secret, since
I think only in the 19th century was it discovered that Troilus and Creseyde
was in bulk a translation of Boccaccio's Filostrato (only slightly
gentrified).

Ciao,

Murat

about the readers:

Robert Kocik poet, prosodist, artist, builder, lives in Brooklyn, NY, where he owns and operates
the Bureau of Material Behaviors. Architecturally, the 'missing civic service' is his declared
niche. He is currently involved in the design phases of the Preemptive Peace Place (an agency
devoted to the permanent peace movement) and the Prosody Building (a building entirely attuned to
the prosodic).  His poetry plies what he refers to as 'burst prosody'--perfused by and propagating
all things. His essays comprise the the nascent discipline known as the Sore, Oversensitive
Sciences (SOS). Recent additions to SOS include: The Susceptive System and Stressogony. With
choreographer Daria Fain he has initiated an experiential, aesthetic science named the Prosodic
Body. His publications include: *Overcoming Fitness* (Autonomedia, 2001) and *Rhrurbarb* (Field
Books, 2007).

Overcoming cure. Regardless.
Space is a function of finding
you. Your only exterior
my euphoria. Regardless.

With that with which it can’t be shown...
forming a residue—
a field of rhubarb and zinnias,
the dimensions of the workspace,
a boat-swallowing fish from
water drained from raccoon track.
~ from Robert Kocik’s *Rhrurbarb*


Jonathan Skinner publishes Field Books and edits the review ecopoetics (www.ecopoetics.org),
teaches Environmental Studies at Bates College and lives in Bowdoinham, the tick capital of Maine.
 His *Political Cactus Poems* are available through Palm Press (www. palmpress.org).
