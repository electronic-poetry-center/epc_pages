Lately, for a long time, lately, I have not been putting anything
'artificial' in my ears. In a kind of contrary mode, I guess, when I walk I
relish quiet zones, and/or ignoring the persistence of personal chat,
voices, etc. in my skull.
"Silence" , practiced as such, in the City, is a contradiction of terms,
night or day. But, when I walk, once I put my attention to it, I find it
rich and diverse in sounds. Conversations, jackhammers, airplanes overhead,
cell phones, traffic, etc., etc. The closer I listen, it gets down to a
syllable, vowel, diphthong level. The various volumes, rhythms - the mix of
spiked and flat sounds - take on a music of sorts. Which, in turn, informs
the motion and attention of the walk.

Which is not to negate at all the experience of listening to great music to
either enhance the way of looking at and being with space, or providing the
means to get through a real difficult one. In California, for example,
driving Highway 5 up or down the San Joaquin Valley between from where the
Grapevine meets the Valley and, probably, the Los Banos turnoff, this
stretch can really do you in without 'enhancers.'

Anyway, as a general rule, I take a little vow of silence for the first 15
to 30 minutes of any walk. Amazing what the kinds of sounds it brings across
'the windshield.'

Murat,=0A=0ASorry to take so long to respond to this thread and if hyou hav=

=0A=0ACreeley says:=0A=0A    "The words will become a world, sustaining the=
 occasion of thought...This is not...to find an escape from what problems m=
ay exist in all senses...But in the care with words, a world occurs, made p=
ossible by that care. Williams writes: 'If the language is distorted, crime=
 flourishes. It is well that in the unobstructed arts (because they can at =
favorable times escape the perversions which flourish elsewhere) a means is=
 at least presented to the mind where a man can go on living.'"=0A=0AAnd Ja=
mes Breslin, expounding on WCW's poetics said: =0A=0A    "mental=0Aactivity=
 in most people is conducted primarily at the level of ordinary=0Aconscious=
ness or the ego. The distinctive feature of such life is its tendency=0Atow=
ard a rigid conservatism, a fear of new experience, and a desire to operate=
=0Asafely and fixedly within established categories. Locked within a system=
, cut=0Aoff from fresh experience by the desire for security, the ordinary =
man will be=0Aemotionally and sensually starved; in a real sense, he will n=

less activity will be futile=85his fear of the new, thwarting the=0Acreativ=
e process of renewal, is self-destructive=94  =0ASo I disagree that words a=

I'm with you there, Stephen. I love the song of the city,
and when Lynda and I travel by car we've long been
used to having the radio off (the habit began back in
the days of broken windows and stolen radios, etc.).
So we hear the sound of the car rushing through air,
the whine of tires, varying with the road surfaces, etc.,
even on those long, same-old stretches.

Hal, also a music lover

"Can't stop the dancing chicken."

Tom,

  It is that whole area. I don't think that the people of Sauk Center were very proud of Sinclair Lewis. But it is often that way.
  Yes, I grew up in Sauk Rapids, and I know the garden. It was down the street from where we lived--we called it the rock garden and it was created by a man named Louie Wippich. He was still living when I was a child. St. John's has a beautiful wooded area. I used to take my dogs for a walk to the chapel that is reputedly haunted. But Stearns County is a strange part of the country--we used to say that there was a Stearns country syndrome, based on incest among other things. Now I suspect that incest is not uncommon in many rural parts of the country. Whenever I talk about living here it is  with a kind of ashamed surprise that I am still here after all these years.

two points of interest I know of in that neck of the woods are the Gardens of Eternity (? not sure of the name) in Sauk Rapids, which is one of a scant few visionary art environments I know of in Minnesota; and the St. Urho statue in Menahga (part of the "Finnish Triangle") -- http://www.roadsideamerica.com/sights/sightstory.php?tip_AttrId=%3D11468

worth a visit too: the brutalist St. John's Abbey Church (designed by Marcel Breuer) -- http://www.greatbuildings.com/buildings/St_Johns_Abbey.html

as you can see, I relate to the region in terms of pilgrimage sites -- if it was worth writing about in the 1938 WPA guide (or would have been, had the guide been written today), it's usually something I want to check out.

Tom,
Please don't forget the "heart of the heart of the country" (Stearns County/St. Cloud). Or are we part of the Metro area (almost)? Cuturally, we are almost forgotten.

since most announcements on this List refer to events either in NYC or in Buffalo, I assume they're taking place way out yonder there. still, clearer siting of the events would help me to decide just how impossible it will be for me to attend (more's the pity!).

* to be fair, there are some subdivisions within "Outstate," such as the Range (the Iron Ranges, home of brave miners and Bob Dylan); the North Shore (Lake Superior shore, from Duluth to the Canadian border); the Arrowhead (mostly wild country north and west of the North Shore); an amorphous zone comprising an area centered on Lake Itasca, the source of the Mississippi, including Brainerd, Bemidji -- the Lakeland -- as well as the Red Lake reservation lands and the rich farmland in the northwestern corner of the state; Red River of the North Valley and Lake Agassiz prairielands; the wide, rolling farm country sliding south from Alexandria, along the border with the Dakotas; the Minnesota River Valley (a giant backwards checkmark crossing diagonally through the southern third of the state; and then what I think of as "the toe" of the state, containing Rochester and (guess what?) more farmland.

as I write this all out, it strikes me as similar to L. Frank Baum's description of the Land of Oz -- don't ask me where the Winkies of Minnesota live: they went underground years ago, and didn't leave a forwarding address. (Dorothy/Judy Garland/Frances Gumm was from Grand Rapids about 60 miles east of Bemidji, in case anyone wants to go make a house-call.)

A suggestion:

Each of us seems to be absolutely certain that the locale of her/his event
is obvious. But it isn't. Maybe with all this cyber-everything it would
behoove us to mention what city, village, mountain range, island, nation, or
planet we're talking about--somewhere easily findable on the announcements
of these awesome events.

It ain't "just" the poets. I am on a Buddhist list, and find myself
searching, often in vain, for the actual location of the talk, action. Or
non-action. Whatever.

Just an idea.

Could someone please enlighten me as to the best way to send
books/journals through the mail. The rate change scheme courtesy of
TimeWarner and AT/T types seems fishy. I sent off some smaller sized
packages (6"x8") first class the other day and they ended up costing
about $1.81 a piece. Is this normal? Have the rate changes even gone
into effect yet? I ask those involved with small press publishing (the
good lot of you, I trust) what is the cheapest and most effective way
to send books and magazines out?

participant editors (ie.YOU!), no form or genre will be sanctioned. We
at lil' Norton only ask that work chosen for each volume should be
easily and cheaply reproducible.

Generally, media mail, for which allow a maximum of 2 weeks.
Sometimes first class is only a couple of cents more.It's the weight
of the package (up to 70 lbs) and not the size that makes the
difference (except for oversized packages).

Likewise.

I have a hard time understanding why anyone would want to listen to
music constantly. When a friend got one of the first walkmen I tried
it walking through Greenwich Village--once. It was a trip, but who
wants to trip all the time? And it cut me off radically from the life
around me (which is I guess the purpose--the outside world becomes
entertainment), as if it were a movie and the only reality was what
came through the earphones. I imagine that sense would have worn off
with use, but would I want to create a soundtrack for every experience?

There could be an industry here. How about a hike through Darfur? A
mosque bombing in Iraq? A US family becoming homeless? A plague?
Melting tudra? Call the series "Music To Die With." Humanitarians
could even hand out CDs to the victims.

And there's the matter of safety. Even the safest of cities has its
dangers--best to stay alert in all one's senses.

Hi



I have been unable to receive mail all day. Apparently, somebody accessed my

counting so far).



If you've tried to reach me, please send the message again. Sorry for the

Well I was taught one's relationship to art and creatively should
always be a natural phenomena and definitely not controlled by any
sense of the aesthetic so I agree with Stephen's earlier comment about
poetry's bad aim. Mine is a Buddhist approach I think but it mixes
well with the Breslin quote Paul gave about the danger of seeking
security and perhaps recognizes as aggression what Murat suggests
regarding the placement of language or the pursuit of any particular
thing, whether it's transformative or not. There's no point in picking
the flower. Things don't have to be that complicated. The space within
which things occur, our environment, is a natural one with continuity
and all-pervasiveness so it's actually a matter of not falling into a
comfortable ego-trap of creating separation between you and it,
between medium and oneself. Therefore this thorny question of how to
penetrate into media or otherwise relate to, control, or manipulate
audience or one's access to audiences (as Paul worried about earlier)
is achievement oriented in outlook and maybe should always be prefaced
with a commodification moniker like the word "professional" so we know
the interest is not purely in the arts but rather sensitive to the
economies of consumption which could surround it. I find everything is
already pre-arranged and completed in that kind of art and it lacks
genuineness. It never seems to be able to perceive a blank page or
canvas to work with because everything is always done out of
necessity. The whole idea there seems to be to turn people's heads
which I find a very militant philosophy and which also attracts a
militant congregation. Attempts to expand the margins of poetry or any
art, at least for me, must include a willingness to be open and let
things go; to give up on any efforts to try and impress or excite
people or put on a show for them. Any school-of-thought which teaches
separation between artist and audience, where messages are sent from
one to the other, becomes an exhibition, a competition for the
ostentatious and burlesque. I think we as artists can have more
confidence and insight than that. So it doesn't start with words or
any flash of inspiration or strategy, at least for me, because all
those means seek a desired end, but it is rather a simple embodiment
of both creator and viewer together as-it-happens in an appreciative
sense of an environment of no-categories, inviting expression and
expansion because nobody has any roles to play or fear of wrong moves,
just plain enjoying the marvelous art like a simple tea ceremony.

I never know whether to laugh with near disbelief or cry with the endlessly=
 encountered realization how many fellow citizens really are "not here/hear=
" and with amazement take a kind of tourism tune-in once in a while  to see=
 and hear some of the conventionalized sites/sights/cites "already written"=
 (Leonardo Sciasia) or familiar via their ubiquitous mediated representatio=
ns--of "the world" or "street" or "walking" . . . "people" . . . "land/city=
scapes" . . .     (to be fair,though, i have never had a driver's license--=
and tried a walkman maybe three times and found it a real drag-i kept wanti=
ng to hear the things i saw and touched---and also dangerous--you couldn't =
hear things behind or around you--doesn't seem like the greatest idea in th=
e world--unless you are always somewhere very safe--etc--)    About five ye=
ars ago i got on a bus on which there were only three men already seated.  =
One, a business looking sort--was very importantly very busy on a cell phon=
e--another, a heavy set kid in a heavy metal t-shirt--was perofming ar-drum=
 beats and sining along with his cd player-via-earphones music--and the thi=
rd, a thick set short man with eyes fixed unswervingly on a spot in space--=
was talking loudly to omone only he could see about the immenent arival of =
the end of the world---         I suddenly realized the only person other t=
han the bus driver who was actually "here/hear" was myself--listening to an=
d watching the gestures and pantomimes of this vocalising trio--        Sin=
ce i do most of my art work lierally on and in streets, construction sites,=
 parks, business ditricts, abandoned industrial areas--using rubBEings and =
clay impression spray paintings--it is a further development daily of all t=
he range of one's street and out door experiences wheter in the forests of =
Vermont or living in the streets of big cities--           There are always=
 people, machines, animals, birds--or weathers of all timesof the year--pas=
sing by--for simple surivival one could never imagine not being aware of th=
e sounds around one--or the things emerging which are every found hidden in=
 plain sites/sights/cites . . .          The strange discoveries of the wor=
ld i have read about here and started finding out about in other places--st=
ruck me as perhaps the latest cycle in a recurrent vogue in American cultur=
al history which began roughly in the 1830's--when cemeteries like Mount Au=
burn in Cambridge, MA were being built as simulatenously parks filled with =
beaitufl gardens, a striking tower-topped hill, statues, monuments, mausole=
ums, winding paths, beaitufl epitp[ahs, benches--all forthe contemplation o=
f both nature and the Eternal, the taking in of health giving fresh non-cit=
y air and the taking in of helahty "good" thouhts regarding mortalisty and =
morality.  Aesthetics and ethics were combined with the leisurely stroll--a=
nd--the cemetery /park was used as a kind of bridge betwen the old city and=
 the new suburbs.              This beautiful place, constructed really for=
 "walking" and "seeing" and "hearing" (birds, trees inthe wind, conversatio=
ns not in a crowd, quiet from th horses, carriages, trams of streets)--and =
combing Eternal Rest with Leisrure and Contemplation helthful for body and =
soul--began ironically enough becuase there was no more room in Boston ceme=
teries for the ever increasing population of the dead--as well as their fel=
low citizens above ground growing too numerous for the narrow streted old c=
ity.          In order to get the quick and the dead moving--what better me=
thod than this making of a place combining so many enticing features and so=
 efficiently taking care of the problems of urban "crowding" above and belo=
w ground?          I think that these recurrent vogues and re -discoveries =
of the world --and the ways they are used  for the arts--is something very =
interesting--as it seems to recur--every few decades--and i have begun to s=
tudy it in terms of changes in the technologies of seeing--and also now of =
listening--since the transistor radio appeared in the 1950's--somnething th=
at could be carried with one outside of the car--        That a great deal =
of the world isn't really visible or heard--and when itis, oftenrecongized =
only in the sense that it "looks like" photos of it--or the way it was seen=
 in a film or on tv--and in turn the use of music and talk radio etc--the u=
se of "art" as a "wall" which on the other side has a "life" left behind--t=
hat is revisited nostalgically--and has "specimens" and "artefacts" brought=
 back from it--           In a strange way, the more the availability of ev=
er increasingly sophisticated "vision machines" takes over the ways of peop=
le's own seeing--the less there is seen --or heard--by themselves--of what =
is happening around them--except as something distanced perhaps as in the c=
emetery/park into things "aesthetic" and "ethical"--"good for you"--like "w=
alking is good for you"--                 > Date: Sun, 1 Jul 2007 10:00:28 =

I really do like to multi-track myself. Well, I'm already
multi-tracked--'experience' is being fetishized here--aren't we all? And
differently.
My wife has music in her mind all the time; her problem is that it is
seldom of her choosing. Two of my sons are the same. I never have music
going on so   I use a walkman (that should be ipod but ...). I walk
quite a lot, but usually the same routes. I could probably do them
blindfold. Tf anything the music
sharpens, or renews,  my attention to such overfamiliar scenes by laying
over it an exitement not its own but which then becomes its own.

Dear Friend-o-SUNY,

While another E-Fishwrapper grows in the
dark belly of the SPokenword LAB, (now at its secret Slaughter
location) Lana Ayers and I have cooked up what we think is a delightful
poetry exercise for August. Not completely original, as August has been
3:15 Experiment time for many years, and many others have done post
card poetry. We also have not figured out a catchy name, so we look to
you for that and for your daily participation in August.

Well, here it is in Lana's words:

"The August Postcard Poetry Fest."
  Would you like to get lots of cool postcards with original poems mailed to you in the dog days of August?

  To get 'em, you have to send 'em.

  Here's how it
 works:

  You sign up by email, providing your name and postal address to splabman@yahoo.com.  The first 31 poets to respond are in.

  Then you receive a list by email of names and
 addresses.  Go out to your local bookstore or thrift shop and pick up some cool postcards to send.

  On July 27th, you'll mail out postcards with original poems of your own to the first 3 people on your list.


  As
soon as you receive a postcard from someone else, write a new short
poem, perhaps incorporating something from that postcard, and send your
new poem to the next person on your mailing list on August 1 and continue each August day.

  For
every postcard you receive, you'll write and send a new short poem on a
postcard. Sure, continue the conversation you've been having to the
next person, even if they have not been in on it. We'll settle it all
in the Fall.


  By the end of August, you'll
have a whole collection of limited edition postcard poems by all the
poets on the list. Maybe we'll gather in September to read the best of
these, so try to keep Saturday the 22nd free for a Seattle-area event. If you do sign up, please
be committed to the process, so everyone gets a poem for every day.


Thanks for your interest.

hey list folks,

a student of mine recently sent work to an online journal called
Listenlight and found his work posted to the site in a much revised
version (including new lines added to the poem). I wrote to the
editor there, Jesse Crockett, who said that he felt he had improved
the poems. just wanted to send out a heads up to stay away from this
one.

I have to say that this surprises me, because I've had some work published
in listenlight, and while the editor did suggest some edits, the final
decision was left up to me.

Lisa,

I experienced the same treatment. I thought I may have been the only one wh=
o's poems became "better" once the editor reworked them. I asked the editor=
 to return them to their original state, but I don't believe that change ev=
er took place.

The Washington Post - which seems to be trumping the NY Times all over he
place on coverage of the Executives in Washington - has an interesting one
today:

The Imperiled Presidency Inside the Bunker
A President Besieged and Isolated, Yet at Ease
Bush, Grasping for Answers and Fixated on Iraq, Remains Resolute
http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/07/01/AR2007070101
356.html?hpid=topnews    (!!)

I am particularly drawn to this 'found' moment of 'touch' with a wounded
soldier to whom he is introduced after a speech to students at a school in
Harlem:
.. King, the GOP congressman, introduced him backstage to a soldier injured
in one eye. Bush teared up and asked the young man to take off his dark
glasses so he could see the wound, King recalled. "Human instinct is when
someone has a serious injury to look the other way," King said. "He actually
asked him to take them off. He actually touched the eye a little. It was
almost as if he felt he had to confront it."

Interesting to imagine  what Bush is really 'confronting' here with  the
touch. A 'literal' moment rather than a 'rhetorical' one?  I find the whole
interaction loaded with implication, though it might have quickly
disappeared from the President's personal consciousness. His experience of
Post Traumatic Stress Syndrome will happen after he leaves Office, if then.
However, I  suspect this moment is already making it's way into an opera
score yet to be written.

In this article, for further weird flavor,  Kissinger is also quoted as
saying the President has not asked him to pray with him (as Nixon did when
his regime was collapsing from Watergate et al).

I am afraid we are a long way from the opera or any other form that might
cope with this one.

Yes, I don't rule out - even if I could! - bringing in other means to
intensify or reshape the way of looking. Grass,mushrooms, certain kinds of
music, the accompaniment of a friend with a 'good eye' (or a knowledge of a
history of x place) can certainly bring eye and ear closer into a fresh or
new experience of whatever the space.

I think the issue here is the use of 'ear' devices to block out the
environment. It's the "kill 'em" response I have to somebody driving with a
cell phone at their ear while turning a corner without any awareness at all
that I am in the crosswalk and I have the light - for  the most extreme, but
pretty common example. A dangerous drug those cell phones.

To each in all all in each and in equal parts hello,


  As some of you may know, in a work entitled "Days," I have been making an improvisational audio-photo poem - like the "strips" of "Transverse," some of which are on ubu.com - each 24-hour day so far of 2007. They are part of what somebody calls "phoetry."


I just recently posted a slew to get relatively caught up – being busy with raising children, teaching and phd work – and so thought to post word, thus:


http://www.youtube.com/profile?user=Samtruitt

 Youtube allows for comments, and I would be pleased to read your takes. I can say these are different from "Transverse" in that I am no longer in NYC and so not walking as much and so much of these happen in a state of standing, sitting or driving (though not sleeping yet).


 Many thanks  for looking as you may.
 Sam

Early last month, I received the unexpected gift of a manuscript that I =
thought had been lost. A woman whom I have never meet, an art gallery =
owner in Sausalito, CA., had been storing them. Apparently, some thirty =
years ago, I had given the manuscript to a friend, a young San Francisco =
lawyer, with whom I didn't stay in touch. Now I learned from this woman =
that he died twenty years ago!
=20
All that time she had kept the manuscript, not knowing how to contact =
me. Then, inadvertently, she came across my name on the Internet. What =
kindness, safeguarding for twenty years work of poet unknown to herself!

I've been reading the poems, over one hundred of which, with some =
amazement and light revising, I've decided are worthwhile offering to =
whomever cares to read them:

Paper Kite Press has a new address! As of July 1st, we're officially
in our new studio:

443 Main Street
Kingston, PA 18704
USA

It's a first floor storefront space - nice and roomy (perfect for
readings and workshops) with loads of bookshelves! Since we need some
time to shuffle books and furniture (and paint the walls gallery-white
(hmm, why would we do that?)), we'll be launching into the regular
workshop and reading schedule again in August. Stay tuned!

We've also significantly ramped up the publication schedule - two new
books coming out in the next few months:

Too Bad It's Poetry by Jim Warner

and

Silent Type by Barbara DeCesare

We're constantly receiving manuscripts, and the schedule is filled
through 2009.  Please check out the website for our current list of
titles.

Happy Summer,
Jennifer & Dan

Perhaps in touching the solider's wounded eye El Diablo Bush is, in Stephen=
's words,  "bringing in other means to intensify or reshape the way of look=
ing . . . {for} the accompaniement of a friend  with a 'good eye' . . . can=
 certainly bring eye and ear closer into a fresh or new experience of whate=
ver the space."        The Situationists 40 years ago were writing of "Tour=
s in Other People's Misery" and in the 1930's Walter Benjamin wrote of the =
aetheticizing of otherwise grim scenes attainable via the clarity and clean=
liness as it were of Neue Sachlichkeit images.  There's something oddly lik=
e a form of aesthetic tourism in peopledisconnecting from earphones, automo=
biles, virtual screens and walking about among people, trees,voices, sounds=
, streets, trying to find "new" ways to experience something which they are=
 at the same time just discovering as though a previously unknown realm.  T=
here's something bizarrely and hilariously selfrighteous in a person who ha=
s decided to do without earphones for a little while of an afternoon  being=
 mad at a person on a cell phone.          The distances of alienation prod=
uce  strange discoveries of simulated "presents" covering over what is hypo=
thesized as an "absence" yet is an actuality "hidden in plainsite/sight/cit=
e"--not so much a purloined actuality as one barely acknowledged to begin w=
ith, and so ableto have been dispensed with long ago and forgotten about an=
d left behind.  The world becomes a place whereseeings imposed upon it make=
 invisible what is there and seek to fill the "empty space" with the produc=
ts of a "new seeing".   The problems arise when what is already there begin=
s to be exposed, and to expose itself,in the words of Paul Celan:  "Poetry =
no longer imposes itself, it exposes itself."       And Emerson:  "The blan=
k and ruin we see in Nature is in our own eye."        What begins to expos=
e itself--may not "fit the picture"--and so again remains unseen--"a blank =
and ruin"    Or--it may need to be censored, suppressed . . . colonized . .=
 . which is why no doubt many things remain hidden in plain site/sight/cite=

My work also receieved similar treatment in this issue
of LIstenlight. The "improvement" contains only
(modified versions of) words that appear in my
original, but the similarity to my poem ends there
(few strings of more than one word survived, and the
order is utterly different). The editor hasn't
responded to my emails, which were as good-humored as
I could manage (I find the whole thing so odd that
indignation took quite some time to set in at all), or
replaced the published text. All this without prior
notice that the work had been radically
re-written/collaged (to its detriment, I'm sorry to
say), or that the work had been accepted at all.

Yeah, watch out.

Lisa,

I experienced the same treatment. I thought I may have
been the only one who's poems became "better" once the
editor reworked them. I asked the editor to return
them to their original state, but I don't believe that
change ever took place.

JULY 4th POLITICAL ART ACTIONS: CHICAGO, IL
******************************************************

Feel Tank Chicago and Mrs. Rao's Growl present
The 5th Annual International Parade of
the Politically Depressed & Picnic LAUGH
http://pathogeographies.net

July 4, 2007
The parade will start:
2pm at Gallery 400, 400 S. Peoria.
The picnic LAUGH will start:
4pm in the Art Institute sculpture garden
the north side near the Henry Moore statue.

Come barbecue your sense of defeat.
Marinate it in a delicious concoction
of counter-politics and collectivity.
Stew in alternative emotions!

Wear black (dress depressed), bring your meds, and
bring something colored red to lie down on.
Come help feel and make a political world that
deserves our optimism.

LAUGH will be the picnic after the parade!
This performance has been performed numerous places
and times since the war began. It is based on the
therapeutic laughing circles of India and the
children's game called HA HA HA in which participants
lie on their backs with their heads on each other's
bellies and laugh (til you cry and cry til you
laugh)--this is a laughter that has no punch
line--laughter as protest, as an aerobic workout, as
ceremony, to strengthen our communal ties, for those
who cannot laugh.

thanks for this lisa jesse also wanted to severely edit my wife's work
but at least let us know first used the same theory of improvement must
be her thing
even wanted to change title sweetly insisting  changes would make poem
better and more readable
yuko my wife declined of course
and when yuko refused tho jesse had said how much she loved the work
despite her intense desire to corrupt it  jesse would not publish it
 to change work without asking breaks all the rules  and is wrong

I submitted something to Jesse earlier this year, and he altered it and
posted the piece under his no. 6 edition:

http://listenlight.net/06/lewis/

he did warn me he was going to do this, and I didn't know any better
than to question his choices, though they weren't offensive enough for
me to pull the piece out. below are the two versions, for comparison.=20

is this kind of behavior on the part of editors just not the done thing?
as in, when you submit a poem the terms should be understood as "take it
or leave it"?

fyi, the piece was written in August '05, which is right before I
experienced a stylistic sea-change (e.g., my first encounter with langpo
and the harder forms of avant-garde writing/theory)... so this one was
kind of an orphan and at the time I was communicating with Jesse I was
aware that it wasn't exactly representative of my current work; that is,
I wasn't so turned off by the idea of someone messing with it. now that
I look back at it, I like my version of the piece better.

This is from the head of an administration which for four years censored any
photographs of coffins of dead soldiers arriving home. Perhaps Bush is
trying to catch up (with something which seems finally has caught up with
him).

He has also begun to consult "deep thinkers," a regular Marcus Aurelius.

Maybe the harmed contributors should have taken a harder look at the
potential significance of the magazine's title; the way in which
"Listenlight" might reflect its editor's hand in revising poems 'upward', so
to speak! I mean "Listenlight" does not seem to want to ask its readers to
do any heavy-lifting!

Not to make any excuses for this abuse of editorial power!!

I had a somewhat similar experience with ListenLight--the editor rewrote
sections of my poem, then asked what I thought. I told him I appreciated the
attention on my work, but didn't feel comfortable with the changes. Then he
sent a bizarre email saying that he thought I might not be who I claimed to
be and that he would feel better about publishing my poems the way I wanted
them if I could prove my identity by sending an email from my school
account. I've never published under a pseudonym, so it was a weird
request--I chose to end correspondance. I also later found his blog (which
doesn't seem to be up anymore, or at least is less googleable). There was a
blog entry or two that was actually the editor describing his interactions
with submitters--his edits, their reactions, etc.

Very strange. At least he didn't put my poems up--

wow, this is kind of baffling. I've never had the editor of a poetry journal
ask for revisions-- you take the poem or you don't. Although a situation
where an editor made certain suggestions that one could take or leave seems
like it would be fine, as long as the poem's author was engaged with the
process-- that's more like collaboration. I wouldn't change my poems so that
an editor would print them in a magazine, but I might change them if an
editor I respected offered insightful suggestions that made sense to me.

But for an editor to simply change a poem and print it without consulting
the author is beyond the pale. For what it's worth, I had some poems in
Listenlight a couple issues ago, and one of them did include a minor change:
"wangled" was printed as "wrangled." When I contacted Jesse about the error,
it was corrected immediately, and all my interactions with Jesse were
friendly and aboveboard. But now this... yep. It's a head scratcher.

Jesse's on this list right? Now might be a good time to chime in...

Nah. You'll remember that Jesus put some spit and dirt on a blind guy's
eyes and
restored his sight. Bush is here just indicating his non-ironic sense
of his own
messianic touch.

Changing a poem and publishing changes without the author's consent is
actually a violation of an author's moral rights. Which is to say, it's not
only unethical, but illegal, though it seems a little fuzzy in the US. All
the same, fairly clear in this instance, I would think.

Jesse has taken down the poem published under my name and responded kindly and frankly to my email. Thought I should let y'all know, rather than leave incomplete the account that took shape here yesterday.

Speaking as the editor of a poetics journal, this all seems so
unethical to me.  I hope it's not as bad as it sounds, but I would
never alter a poem even by one space, unless it was with the author's
explicit permission.

Who am I to say that a poem is better if I alter a break or extend or
a line?  I accept the poem or I don't, unless it's a matter of maybe
one questionable word getting it into the journal or not.  I'd like to
hear what Jesse has to say, too.  Hopefully it's a grave
misunderstanding.

the responses to my post asking for suggestions on 'talks to walk by' have
been really cool. thanks for those.

a wee update on that erm enterprise.

i tried it. with music. on a walk.

it was invigorating. it made me want to break out into a jog. but i'm too
stiff. just started walking about two weeks ago. and, unrelatedly, got a
cellphone/mp3 player. hence the query.

invigorating but slightly unnerving because the trail is also for bikes. so,
as some have mentioned, it's a bit dangerous. probably too dangerous to make
a habit of it.

however, not only was it invigorating; it felt good. the music with the
exercise. it was uplifting.

also, interesting how the music extended from horizon to horizon, as it
were. to the point where, upon encountering others, i had to remind myself
that they were not grooving on the music.

i appreciate the points people made about the value of actually listening to
what's going on around you, and the relevance of that point to contemporary
mindscapes. but, you know, even when we're 'listening', i wonder how much
gets through.

oddly, i've found  that an interesting way of listening (on a walk or
whatever) is to record it and play it back later. i've only done that a
couple of times. but the results were very interesting. on hearing it later,
i heard it very differently. one interprets the recording more symbolically.
or i do. i tend to miss that symbolic meaning in the 'immersive' experience.

i suppose it's related to the difference between hearing yourself when
you're talking and hearing yourself via a recording. the latter provides a
different 'point of view' or 'point of audition' than the usual one, gives
us two perspectives, opens the third eye (or ear).

Nice one, George.

Always there waiting for the look-see, an olive branch in one hand, plenty o' arrows in the other, a commonplace book in back pocket while said to be seen standing in a runnel of holy water, this baptismal born again (or another guy passing through the turnstile), his mind full of nightmare and day's terror. For some odd reason, this story makes me think of Dickens' A Christmas Carol.

Nah. You'll remember that Jesus put some spit and dirt on a blind guy's
eyes and
restored his sight. Bush is here just indicating his non-ironic sense
of his own
messianic touch.

I am perplexed as to why someone confident enough to send out work (to be shared ostensibly with the planet) would let a journal such as Listenlight, or any other, "barbarize" their hard work - and am sure some of us who are reading such stories are saddened by news of this kind. I think what has been shared by Lisa and others should provide many with a clear warning. Shame.

I remember once telling someone who asked for my advice that at best an editor might make suggestions here and there, but that ultimately it was for the writer to painfully construct the "personality" of his/her own work, and that the risk is in making another's more like their own. I think Stephen and Allison are "right on the mark," as they say.

In the end, one simply has to be confident and sometimes uncomfortably wait, if need be, for "golden ears" (as Ginsberg said). That waiting, as we all know, is much of what process is ultimately about - and that waiting, I think, sorts out those who are less committed from those who are willing to stubbornly prevail.

histoire. memoire.


life in this parts have been pretty good.
http://www.asondheim.org/histoire.mp4
good life has parted from me.
life has never been good.

you might think more about life if you knew how close i was to death.
i am a walking living death. i am welkin.
i will take my life out like a dog.
you will take your dog out to the desert beyond the desert.

they tackle my parasites and defeat me. my defeat strengthens me.
my defeat strengthens me to defeat me.
death, be my harbinger. an omen of omens, sign of signs.
kings of kings and queens of queens.

my body is run replete with something of no consequence.
i speak to you over the wires.
plates of glass and memories ta'en up and laid to rest.
i rescue you in bitterness for the gall and ferocity of life.

i will gouge my eyes out if you don't.
if you don't gouge out my eyes, i will.
if you don't gouge out your eyes, i will.
you will gouge out your eyes if i don't.

hello earth i am not dead i am not healthy. i am what you say.
life, you are a maelstrom to me.
i will put out my eyes and put out my life.

you will shoot it. then you will shoot yourself.
these words were spoken by a dead man a dead woman.
they live inside of me furiously.
i will defeat myself i will kill myself.

i will give a yes yes yes to life. i will give nothing up to death.
you can see death in their eyes. you can see eyes.
sometimes you wake up and you think; eyes are all i see.
a world of eyes watching death, cultivating the garden of death.

the wires burn; there is the smell of burning flesh.
burning flesh, wires, photography and photography's plates.
running everywhere but where.
the fireflies light up the sightless nighttime sky.

This marvelous book, so light on all its hands and feet, so assured in the =
delicacy of its unwavering precision...BELOVED INTEGER presents its visitor=
s/voyagers with a complex adaptive system of memory and desire, a kind of v=
isible city rich in 'variably negotiated moments of production,' in 'oceani=
c felling,' in 'dialogues in solitude,' in easy energy and hard-earned matt=
er, fearlessly held up to the light, which adumbrates the deepest territori=
es of the heart--Laird Hunt.

This is a book for impossible space.  Beloveds who love each other like thi=
s, for whom both language and distance are erotic, will be met by these lum=
inous poems at all points.  It's a delicious subject--how to speak in the f=
irst place, and how to ask for something in a way that's neither negotiatio=
n nor seduction.  Something else.  Intense expression.  I am trying to desc=
ribe the incredible relationship the writer has to words--phrasing, phoneme=
s, possible verbs.  Michelle Naka Pierce writes to us here, from a dark and=
 intimate architecture lined with peeling gold parchment: the letters, illu=
minated, partially torn and always, always broken off.--Bhanu Kapil

Michelle Naka Pierce was born in Tokyo, Japan.  Currently associate profess=
or at Naropa University, she has taught at Bard College and the University =
of New Mexico.  Her first book Tri/Via (2003) was co-authored with Veronica=
 Corpuz.  Her poems and interviews have appeared in Traverse, Aufgabe, Inte=
rlope, Shiny, Teachers & Writers, Rain Taxi, and Transformations.  She live=
s in Colorado with her partner, the poet Chris Pusateri.

Eric--

  Media Mail now starts at $2.13 for postage under the new rate hike I fought so hard against
  and so many remained complacent about

  therefore, anything below $2.13 for first class is cheaper

  so usually first class is cheaper, for us, always for chaps
  usually for one full length book of 88pgs it is also--
  for anything beyond one book media is always better

  unless you are in the same state in which case parcel post is the best.

  How that is a helpful lowdown--





Be well

Wow. So this has been happening for some time, to
quite a few people.
Thanks, Alison, for the legal tip--I suspected that
that was the case and, though I have no desire to "go
there," it's good to know for sure.

I agree that Tom's original is better than the
"improved" version; that's probably the case with the
work of most people this has happened to.

Has anyone on this list had any similar experiences
with other editors? It'd be good to avoid their
journals as well.

Eek. One worries.

Andy





I submitted something to Jesse earlier this year, and
he altered it and
posted the piece under his no. 6 edition:

http://listenlight.net/06/lewis/

he did warn me he was going to do this, and I didn't
know any better
than to question his choices, though they weren't
offensive enough for
me to pull the piece out. below are the two versions,
for comparison.

is this kind of behavior on the part of editors just
not the done thing?
as in, when you submit a poem the terms should be
understood as "take it
or leave it"?

fyi, the piece was written in August '05, which is
right before I
experienced a stylistic sea-change (e.g., my first
encounter with langpo
and the harder forms of avant-garde writing/theory)...
so this one was
kind of an orphan and at the time I was communicating
with Jesse I was
aware that it wasn't exactly representative of my
current work; that is,
I wasn't so turned off by the idea of someone messing
with it. now that
I look back at it, I like my version of the piece
better.

The nurse knocked at the door. My mother had instructed me to be there,
waiting downstairs in the front room, far removed from the reclusion of
my hermetic lair, to greet her when she arrived. I had not met this
nurse. Her name, Kate, was all I knew of her, but my mother was reputed
to have the best eye in the city for good help. I waited for her to
knock again, but quickly heard the key turn in the door. I stood as she
opened the door and let herself in.

“You must be Kate.”

“Stephen,” she said, resting her satchel lightly on the floor, “hello,”
closing the door as lightly behind her. “I have a key. Your mother gave
me a key.”

She was hired for the full-time care of my father. It was a very good
job for a new graduate, and there were dozens of applicants, though I
had met none of them. My mother had interviewed five in considerable
depth and hired Kate for a good deal more than the typical salary for
new graduates going to work in hospitals, so she may have expected her
work to be more demanding, but she had no more to do here than babysit
my father.

“Where is Dr. Shirov?”

Her precipitous bill of charge was my father the famous doctor.
Apprehensive, nauseous, I paused, standing still, saying nothing,
staring at her like a troll. She smiled as quickly and unexpectedly as
her key had turned in the door, brushing a lock of dark hair behind her
ear and removing her shades, perching them on her head. They were cheap,
her sunglasses, but she was dressed very well, dressed more like my
mother than a new nurse. She smiled again with another disarming gesture
of pursing her lips and arching her brow, “I was told he would be here.”

“Yes, he’s here.”

I stayed in place as she knelt slightly to pick up her satchel,
anticipating the way being led to her work, but I did not move. I wanted
to interrogate her, this happy stranger, but could merely ask why she
was dressed like a lawyer. I felt ashamed, ready to point the way
through the hall to my father and then retreat, yet again she smiled,
finishing with another articulate expression. “It’s my first day on the
job. I was told to dress business casual.”

“This is business casual,” I said, plucking my loose collar with stoic
condescension. “You look like a district attorney.” She offered another
variant of genial smile as I wondered what she had been told about me,
like a basilisk imposing on her. “He spits up like an infant. You’ll
want to keep your suit clean.” She smiled again without strain or
hesitance, jostling her satchel, “It’s in the contract. Your mother pays
for dry cleaning.”

“Right,” I droned idiotically, surprised by her warmth and lively face,
wanting to ask her more questions, wanting to engage her with all the
stupid questions of my witless warmth, charmed by her ease and light,
but anything I could possibly say was already in my own mind a
lugubrious echo. Then she made a quizzical, birdlike darting askance of
her nose, “Stephen?”

I said nothing, still gazing on her from the warmth she gave through
such brief gestures, stalling another moment for my name in her voice,
but a small dot of insight for the plain fact of her being there in
perfect confidence of her skills, excited to start a new job, broke my
gaze. I moved, finally, turning away from her and out of the front room.
As she followed, the metronomic report of her heels against the hard
floor was a calculated pulchritude that quelled my lingering euphoria by
the end of the hallway, opening widely into my father’s den. I looked
without mystique to the young nurse as she appraised my father,
incapacitated. “That’s him,” I said. She glanced half away from him to
murmur some indiscernible question or note surprise in the contrast from
this domestic comfort to the sterilized gleam of an operating room,
where no doubt she had planned through school to start a career,
wondering how tending this lone invalid would make meaningful work,
voicing a few muffled sounds that only the walls could understand.

Soon she would have questions. I did not want to answer any of them. She
had most likely read his large medical file dating from the current
status all the way back. I had not read it, nor had I ever been curious
to learn the greater details of my father’s condition beyond a
summarized remark. And judging from Kate’s reaction, she had read his
file starting from the present, working backwards through the years to
an exponential height of information. It was one way or the other, and
the questions remaining from either vantage were equally predictable.
But I did not want to be rude. “I’ll be in the kitchen for breakfast,” I
said, leaving her there, “first left as you come back,” avowing for her
sake to provide from the kitchen a decent modulation of clattering noise.

Jim,

  I don't think your method is odd at all!  And congrats on getting back to it ...

  Indirectly related to your idea below, I discovered an artist, Janet Cardiff, a few years ago -- she's known for her "audio tours" -- basically, you don a walkman that she's recorded onto and walk the path she's outlined, but it comes complete with her narration and sometimes visual accoutrements.  Here's a link to one description:  http://www.publicartfund.org/pafweb/projects/05/cardiff/cardiff-05.html

  Anyway, you might be onto something there -- you could use that visual talent you have and put it to use through your walk recordings, etc.

  Wait, I found a better description:  http://www.artfocus.com/JanetCardiff.html

  Best,
  Amy

I do this a lot, especially in my parent's neighborhood in south queens: I'=

 adults are gossiping (lots of Italians!) and then I hit Charles Park to gr=

I'd like to reflect a bit on why we believe--and I do too--that our poems can't be edited. Most of the writing I do is art criticism, and all of that is subjected to a fairly thorough editing process. Likewise, I edit for one of the magazines I write for, and I've edited for other magazines in the past, so I have experience of both sides of the relationship. Of course it is assumed that nothing is published under my name that I haven't approved of--although in small ways that assumption is honored in the breach probably more often than I remember, and there are certain specific exceptions: notably, in the magazine world, the title of the piece is an absolute editorial prerogative; esp. with the bigger magazines, the title I give an article is just a suggestion. In my experience, most of the editors I've worked with have helped my writing immeasurably. We sometimes get into serious arguments, and they sometimes annoy me intensely, but even that always turns out to be part of
 the process of making the article better.

  On the other hand, I've only ever had the most tentative suggestions from those who publish my poetry. They share the assumption that to even think of intervening in another poet's work is not something too be done easily or lightly.

  So does this mean that we believe that other forms of writing, such as art criticism, are the rsult of collective effort whereas poetry is a purely individual matter? Does it imply that we have shared criteria for quality in prose writing while we lack any but the most intuitive criteria for poetry? Does this presumed difference between two kinds of writing have any political implications? (For iistance, does one therefore sign up to libertarianism in the act of writing poetry?)

Hi, everyone,

The Towson Arts Collective has a great space for readings and performances =
in the heart of North Baltimore. This fall we're beginning a new reading se=
ries - an extension of the Annual "Cruellest Month Reading Series" that bro=
ught together over 150 people with 12 poets.

I'd like to extend an invitation to everyone who'd be interested in reading=
 for the series. This is my first attempt at contacting anyone. I'm not per=
sonally inviting anyone this time: I think it's necessary to entertain a br=
oader spectrum of poetry since our audience is growing (a mixture of Towson=
 U. and Goucher U. faculty and students, and locals from Baltimore City and=
 County).

If anyone is in Baltimore this fall, please write me. The series will be he=
ld on 3rd Thursdays. We're also curating a Cabaret night on First Thursdays=
 (when businesses and bars stay open later) and film nights on 2nd and 4th =
Thursdays.

The Towson Arts Collective is also available to host workshops: there are t=
wo large galleries plus a drawing studio.

Anyone who's interested in reading for the fall, or wants to make a suggest=
ion, please write me at cacasama@towson.edu

If you're interested in teaching a workshop, please write Brian Truax for d=
etails. His eMail address is towsonframinggallery@earthlink.net


Thanks!

When I do chapbooks I give the author a headsup when they give me a
solicited manuscript that I'll be marking it up pretty heavily, a whole lot
of red ink. And then I'll get together with the author for a few hours to
review the manuscript. All I ask is for the author to explain their choices,
or simply say, at times, that they have no explanation, that that's just
what they wrote. 90% of my queries go away and maybe 10% stick.

I remember one time yrs ago when I offered to publish a friend's work. I
designed and edited the chapbook and then we went over it. Every correction,
every suggestion they said no to, with no explanation. A half an hour into
this process I asked them what the name of their small press was going to
be, because this wasn't going to be a boog book, that I'm an editor, not a
printer.

From Herodutus to Oedipus to Virgil to Dante to Chaucer to Bunyan to the
Wordsworths & Coleridge to Charles Dickens ..... Any number of folks (Lisa
Robertson, Rebecca Solnit, Janet Cardiff (for a good overview) Hamish
Fulton, Johsua Cooper, Richard Long - (let alone folks in other mediums)
people have been bringing 'the walk' on home in a multiple ways (and clearl=
y
there is not a 'singular right way'.)
Jonathan Skinner's 'ecopoetics' journal is a good source of contemporary
looking/listening & making by contemporary poets and writers.

I like your description of interaction with the various forms of trail
transport. Clearly as the petrol runs out, the big collisions in the world
will be between bikers/skaters/walkers and birders! I can see the court
cases mounting!

(Ironically - in terms of a literature - a friend of mine once said, 'the
cell phone is the restoration of narrative' (i.e. "I am at the baggage
terminal where are you now? Close?" Response, "I am just coming off the
freeway and I am practically in the terminal", etc. etc.)

Oh, well, sometimes, for me anyway, if I drop some writerly insistence on
making a work out of everything I do (i.e. From walks and walking) a new an=
d
fresh work  emerges in a form that I would never have prescribed, but in a
form that (retrospectively) was dictated by the 'character' of the space.
Other times it can be the opposite. The imposition of a form or medium make=
s
the content of the walk much more interesting. Take Ron Silliman's Ketjak
and Tjanting for instance where the streets really pop to life - let alone =
a
bunch of other kinds of reflection -  out of the formulation of a strict
adherence to form.=20

Can't help myself from putting in a plug for my own new book, Walking
Theory!

Stephen Vincent's work here preserves and enhances the ancient association
of the foot as measure of the poetic line. In Walking Theory measure become=
s
metaphor:  =B3...foot ever to the ground, image by image, /thought by thought=
,
word by word...=B2 This is the measure of the continuity of a poet=B9s life as
he moves through the days, from the grief-stricken rhythms of the opening
section of elegies to the more expansive tours of the San Francisco
neighborhoods where he lives and works.  Vincent celebrates the beauty of
these familiar landscapes, as well as strange, unexpected and sometimes
mundane details. In a wonderful pun that arises in the midst of the naming
of spring flowers, =B3the dotted eye=B2 suggests the I of linguistic convention
as the seeing, moving body=B9s eye transformed by language. Finally, in this
serious play of words, the poets asks: =B3what can the poem do, walking,
step-by step:=B2 and credo-like responds: =B3witness, suffer, hope.=B2

"calculated pulchritude that quelled my lingering euphoria"? Bait?

Subject: It's a beautiful day in the neighborhood

The nurse knocked at the door. My mother had instructed me to be there,
waiting downstairs in the front room, far removed from the reclusion of
my hermetic lair, to greet her when she arrived. I had not met this
nurse. Her name, Kate, was all I knew of her, but my mother was reputed
to have the best eye in the city for good help. I waited for her to
knock again, but quickly heard the key turn in the door. I stood as she
opened the door and let herself in.

"You must be Kate."

"Stephen," she said, resting her satchel lightly on the floor, "hello,"
closing the door as lightly behind her. "I have a key. Your mother gave
me a key."

She was hired for the full-time care of my father. It was a very good
job for a new graduate, and there were dozens of applicants, though I
had met none of them. My mother had interviewed five in considerable
depth and hired Kate for a good deal more than the typical salary for
new graduates going to work in hospitals, so she may have expected her
work to be more demanding, but she had no more to do here than babysit
my father.

"Where is Dr. Shirov?"

Her precipitous bill of charge was my father the famous doctor.
Apprehensive, nauseous, I paused, standing still, saying nothing,
staring at her like a troll. She smiled as quickly and unexpectedly as
her key had turned in the door, brushing a lock of dark hair behind her
ear and removing her shades, perching them on her head. They were cheap,
her sunglasses, but she was dressed very well, dressed more like my
mother than a new nurse. She smiled again with another disarming gesture
of pursing her lips and arching her brow, "I was told he would be here."

"Yes, he's here."

I stayed in place as she knelt slightly to pick up her satchel,
anticipating the way being led to her work, but I did not move. I wanted
to interrogate her, this happy stranger, but could merely ask why she
was dressed like a lawyer. I felt ashamed, ready to point the way
through the hall to my father and then retreat, yet again she smiled,
finishing with another articulate expression. "It's my first day on the
job. I was told to dress business casual."

"This is business casual," I said, plucking my loose collar with stoic
condescension. "You look like a district attorney." She offered another
variant of genial smile as I wondered what she had been told about me,
like a basilisk imposing on her. "He spits up like an infant. You'll
want to keep your suit clean." She smiled again without strain or
hesitance, jostling her satchel, "It's in the contract. Your mother pays
for dry cleaning."

"Right," I droned idiotically, surprised by her warmth and lively face,
wanting to ask her more questions, wanting to engage her with all the
stupid questions of my witless warmth, charmed by her ease and light,
but anything I could possibly say was already in my own mind a
lugubrious echo. Then she made a quizzical, birdlike darting askance of
her nose, "Stephen?"

I said nothing, still gazing on her from the warmth she gave through
such brief gestures, stalling another moment for my name in her voice,
but a small dot of insight for the plain fact of her being there in
perfect confidence of her skills, excited to start a new job, broke my
gaze. I moved, finally, turning away from her and out of the front room.
As she followed, the metronomic report of her heels against the hard
floor was a calculated pulchritude that quelled my lingering euphoria by
the end of the hallway, opening widely into my father's den. I looked
without mystique to the young nurse as she appraised my father,
incapacitated. "That's him," I said. She glanced half away from him to
murmur some indiscernible question or note surprise in the contrast from
this domestic comfort to the sterilized gleam of an operating room,
where no doubt she had planned through school to start a career,
wondering how tending this lone invalid would make meaningful work,
voicing a few muffled sounds that only the walls could understand.

Soon she would have questions. I did not want to answer any of them. She
had most likely read his large medical file dating from the current
status all the way back. I had not read it, nor had I ever been curious
to learn the greater details of my father's condition beyond a
summarized remark. And judging from Kate's reaction, she had read his
file starting from the present, working backwards through the years to
an exponential height of information. It was one way or the other, and
the questions remaining from either vantage were equally predictable.
But I did not want to be rude. "I'll be in the kitchen for breakfast," I
said, leaving her there, "first left as you come back," avowing for her
sake to provide from the kitchen a decent modulation of clattering noise.

Good question. I'm a professional music and arts journalist by trade, and
quite often see my pieces go to print with minor, once in awhile major,
changes. Often I have approved these changes beforehand and made
counter-changes to suit my editor, but this isn't always the case-- I've
certainly had the experience of seeing a piece of mine go to print in a form
I barely recognize. When I feel like an editor has changed my work in a way
that misses the point, or obscures the point I was trying to make, I feel
irritated-- not because the sanctity of my words has been violated, but
because I would prefer to be involved in the process. I'm always willing to
compropmise as long as I'm involved in the process, and I have some great
editors who can make my pieces "better."

But the "better" in question here relates mostly the market, to which music
and literary criticism are explicitly tied-- i.e. in common review formats,
reviews are linked to release dates, and the position of reviewer is in
large part designed to position one as a consumer's advocate, tacitly
advising what one should or should not spend money on. "Better" in this case
means smoother, with a sturdier structure and more lucid language, more
polished, etc. So to make changes to writing like this doesn't feel
problematic to me, because that writing is already, to a degree, compromised
by market imperatives. Whereas my poetry, which I seldom make money from
(nor do I try to), and which does not bear the responsibility of conveying
something true about a particular subject (one that, at one level, it is
trying to *sell*), exists completely outside of the market. It has no
interest in market imperatives toward lucidity, polish, saleability, etc. In
fact, it works exactly against these imperatives, or strives to. For an
editor to make it "better" misses its point of being a singular incarnation
that has to be contended with for what it is, not another anonymous
smooth-edged pebble in the rock garden of cultural capital.

So for me, it's that simple-- when I'm selling my writing and my writing is
by the nature of its format selling something else, deliberately or
otherwise, it becomes a consumer product and subject to the consumer's
demands-- and the to the editor's, who is paying me. But when it comes to my
poetry, I don't owe anything to anyone-- in fact, it's a sphere I go to get
away from all that.

Barry,

I don't see resistance to the editing of poetry as the point. I think
an editor suggesting edits to a poem or play or piece of fiction or
whatever is absolutely fine. However, to edit the work and print it
with the edits without consulting the author is totally unethical.
There are choices to be made. An editor might accept a work, and then
suggest edits. But since the work has been accepted, if the author
does not agree with the edits, it should be printed as the author
wishes. Or an editor might accept a work conditionally, given the
edits she/he suggests take place. Then, if the author agrees, that is
their choice; if the author does not agree, the work does not get
printed. There may be degrees of either of these acts, but the point
is to have clarity and for the author to approve whatever version of
the work is actually printed. I hope that when your art criticism
goes through "a fairly thorough editing process," that you are
consulted (it sounds as though you are from your description) and
that you have a chance to approve the edits or retract the work; or,
if not, that you have agreed in advance to whatever process is in
place at the journal or press.

As to your question about the criterias for quality, I think we do
see writing poetry as "art" making, and there is a difference between
that and how we see various forms of critical writing (although there
are degrees to our views of any of these forms, and I'm not sure we
should lay "quality" or "value" claims on any of them). But if you
see poetry as art, is there any difference between a journal editing
a poem without consulting the author, and a gallery adding touches of
paint here and there to an artist's painting without consulting the
artist, or taking a chisel to resculpt a stone sculpture in places
here and there without asking the sculptor? And wouldn't that be
rather hideous?

On the other hand, in terms of your question as to "collective
effort," I rather think most of us send our poems to particular
readers and friends whose sense of both poetry and our own work we
trust, for reader's comments and suggestions. We also hear responses
after public readings of our work and may take some of these into
account as we write, rewrite, prepare work for publication, etc. Such
activities work in similar ways to what a painter might do by
inviting other painters or artists or viewers into her studio while a
work is in progress, to talk about the work at hand and listen to
what others have to say about it. Not that all poets or painters do
this, and they may do it in different ways and to different degrees.
But I would think the absolute loner who never listens to anything
but his or her own muse is rather the extreme case.

This FYI below is  not poetry, nor walking, but definitely in the political
air, which seems to be beyond poetry =AD not to mention that beside Libby
walking free, the Brits, Homeland Security here, etc. have tainted with
suspicion every Doctor in the world who happens to be Muslim. Another stake
in the ground for the Cheney/Bush/ wider war on Islam!

Happy 4th of July!!

**

FYI .... A few comments from an online group of Texan politicos in reaction
to Bush's pardoning of Libby ....


From=A0 Harold Cook, the fella who organized the Texas Demos leaving the stat=
e
to try to prevent DeLay's "redistricting":

Good God, first that lovely Paris Hilton girl from a good family, and now
this.
=A0

Could you in good conscience send a guy named =B3Scooter=B2 to the slammer?? I
mean, sheesh, there=B9s only so far you can kick a bar of soap. Wait =AD is tha=
t
why they call him =B3Scooter?=B2=A0
=A0

Plus, the existence and absolute nature of executive clemency IS law, as
stated in Art. II, Sec. 2, of your handy-dandy pocket-sized United States
Constitution (2nd Amendment =B3Right To Bear Arms=B2 commemorative version=8Bthe
one that comes with the free NASCAR limited edition license plate frame).
=A0

What? You aren=B9t carrying a copy of the Constitution with you? Why do you
hate freedom?=A0 President Bush is a great American. He=B9s the decider. He=B9s a
uniter, not a divider. And he=B9s also a multiplier, a subtractor and an
adder.=A0 Scooter is free. Mission accomplished. Long live the Scoot-meister.
Greatest patriot since Oliver North if you ask me.
=A0

You must be one of those Godless commie tree-hugging dope-smokers who
persists in believing that truth and justice have something to do with the
=B3American way.=B2 How cute. Get with the game plan, grandpa =AD that is SO
=B3September tenth.=B2
=A0

The rest of you sissy whiners can do what you want, but I, for one, am goin=
g
to get back to supporting our troops now. Where the hell did I put that
magnetic yellow ribbon gizmo? You=B9re not gonna catch MY ass on that no-fly
list, bucko!





=A0From Michael Sharlot,=A0 U of Texas law School:

Was it an insult to every lawyer and citizen that the Bushites did not
prosecute Sandy Berger who, I am sure you will recall with outrage now as
when it happened, STOLE classified documents from the national archives,
destroyed them and then lied about his conduct, and got off with the loss o=
f
his law lisence?=A0 Why not?=A0 Also, many say Libby lied to cover for Cheney's
plan to further subvert the Constitution.=A0 Why did Berger destroy those
documents?=A0 No outrage?
=A0

Commuting Libby's sentence is an outrage because no President has ever done
such a thing?=A0 Or is it that this use of the admitted Presidential authorit=
y
was unjustified because Libby's crime was unforgivable in any way.=A0 This, I
take it does not apply to Clinton's wholesale pardoning on the last hour of
the last day of his term=A0 Mark Rich's case was, I assume, such a miscarriag=
e
of justice that any President would have pardoned him.=A0 Also, unlike the
Libby case wthere the commutation was an ugly paoff for taking the fall to
protect Chaney, the eminence grise, in the Rich case there was no =A0improper
motive for clemency.=A0 The enormous contribution by Mrs. Rich to the Clinteo=
n
Library was simply a grateful gesture from a devoted wife to the utterly
unexpected merciful action by a President of unquestioned intergrity.=A0 Or a=
m
I mistaken and you were equally outraged by that action?=A0



Jeff Crosby, Illustrator, NYC:

Do not presume to think we thought Clinton's pardons or Berger's handslap
were right.=A0 My question is, are you really saying that, because Clinton di=
d
similar, that it was okay for Bush to let Libby go?=A0 Bullshit.
=A0

Moreover, the outrage is not just about this act but=A0a whole series of acts
by the Bush administration.=A0 In terms of real and potential lawbreaking, th=
e
Bush administration blew past Clinton's 8 years=A0in the first year.


Doug Zabel, Austin political consultant:

I, for one, don't care one whit about whether or not Scooter Libby spends
one day in prison, but I don't understand why Bush would commute this
sentence. There are only three reasons I can think of:=A0 (1) Bush truly
believes the sentence was excessive and he doesn't care that, with 80% of
Americans against a pardon, it might hurt the GOP; (2) the hard-core GOP
base supports a pardon (but Bush isn't running again, so why buckle to this
limited contingent); or (3) Scooter was pissed at being left twisting slowl=
y
in the wind and was likely to spill the beans on the rest of the White Hous=
e
Hooligans.

I vote for No. 3.

P.S. -- I don't remember the Sandy Berger episode quite the way Mike
describes it, but if he was guilty, he should do the time. And I absolutely
opposed Clinton's pardon of Marc Rich. It was simply stupid.=A0 But in neithe=
r
case do I believe the pardons were intended to prevent other misdeeds from
seeing the light of day, and I do believe that's what Scooter's commutation
was about.

By the way, the CIA has recently said that yes, Valerie Plame was a covert
operative at the time of her outing.

this may be a somewhat oversimplified response to this thread, but it seem s
to me that if the author him or herself produces the chap at each step, thot
to note to image to poemz to pages to thread and so forth -- the end result
cannot possibly be what you'd get from a commercial publisher -- it is a
question of focusing from the level of the word thru each level of form that
the physical embodiment of the chap demands -- and i have two of these in
process now so whatever i'm not the expert -- this is not to discount
editing or say that it is inherently, deeply evil, because in some cases the
ideal reader i imagine might emerge from that process and what a significant
kind of thing, but it is to say that the shape of the work or the text is
altered by the commercial production process and the social valences of the
different apparati that process engages, commercial, industrial, interms of
kinds of readers, shelves in bookstores, portals in media, echoes in the
streets and on the fields of corn, and not in all cases is that the best
thing -- if you write to silence, to rupture silence in the process of
production -- not sure .... sometimes yes the issue of audience and the fact
that capitalism exists must be recognized and the overall social good that
depends on that system, but sometimes there is revolution...

Following this discussion has made me glad Listenlght didn't accept
the work I submitted. Apparently the editors didn't think my work was
good enough (or malleable enough) to mutilate.

Generally, I view editing as a 50-50 proposition. Sometimes it helps,
sometimes it doesn't. Its biggest value comes when somebody saves me from
making a complete fool of myself.

While doing music journalism 17 years ago, I did have one particularly
infuriating experience. I had written an article in which I mentioned that
Hartford, Connecticut had a lively jazz scene. The editor changed
my copy to say the scene resembled a Far Side cartoon.

I don't mind corrections being made, or modifications made so that
my piece conforms to "house style." But I do object to the change in
meaning, especially since I was known for speaking my mind and standing
by what I said. I hung out in the jazz clubs in those years and a few
musicians didn't like what I had written before this incident.

I told the editor I don't mind being edited, but that I stand by what I
write and I was extremely displeased with making the changes without
informing me.

It was a commercial paper. I watched a lot of pieces get changed with no
serious reason to complain. I was getting paid. But after that incident,
I wrote one more article and moved on.

I've moved on from Listenlight too.

Good question. I'm a professional music and arts journalist by trade, and
quite often see my pieces go to print with minor, once in awhile major,
changes. Often I have approved these changes beforehand and made
counter-changes to suit my editor, but this isn't always the case-- I've
certainly had the experience of seeing a piece of mine go to print in a form
I barely recognize. When I feel like an editor has changed my work in a way
that misses the point, or obscures the point I was trying to make, I feel
irritated-- not because the sanctity of my words has been violated, but
because I would prefer to be involved in the process. I'm always willing to
compropmise as long as I'm involved in the process, and I have some great
editors who can make my pieces "better."

But the "better" in question here relates mostly the market, to which music
and literary criticism are explicitly tied-- i.e. in common review formats,
reviews are linked to release dates, and the position of reviewer is in
large part designed to position one as a consumer's advocate, tacitly
advising what one should or should not spend money on. "Better" in this case
means smoother, with a sturdier structure and more lucid language, more
polished, etc. So to make changes to writing like this doesn't feel
problematic to me, because that writing is already, to a degree, compromised
by market imperatives. Whereas my poetry, which I seldom make money from
(nor do I try to), and which does not bear the responsibility of conveying
something true about a particular subject (one that, at one level, it is
trying to *sell*), exists completely outside of the market. It has no
interest in market imperatives toward lucidity, polish, saleability, etc. In
fact, it works exactly against these imperatives, or strives to. For an
editor to make it "better" misses its point of being a singular incarnation
that has to be contended with for what it is, not another anonymous
smooth-edged pebble in the rock garden of cultural capital.

So for me, it's that simple-- when I'm selling my writing and my writing is
by the nature of its format selling something else, deliberately or
otherwise, it becomes a consumer product and subject to the consumer's
demands-- and the to the editor's, who is paying me. But when it comes to my
poetry, I don't owe anything to anyone-- in fact, it's a sphere I go to get
away from all that.

May I make a suggestion as an online poetry publisher? Please stop =
throwing stones at this web site. Why are you submitting your poems to a =
site that does not even have guidelines?

Lets move on to the next topic and next time reconsider who you are =
sending your poetry to. Read the guidelines. We (editors and publishers =
the same) spend a lot of time in making sure we make ourselves clear.=20

So stop throwing stones and look at what is in your hand next time and =
give it to a publisher who is clear and is professional.

Have a nice day.

Just wanted to let any interested parties know I have a baby bloglet called
"Joe Brainard's Pyjamas. The link is _http://joebrainardspyjamas.blogspot.com_
(http://joebrainardspyjamas.blogspot.com/) .   Blog focuses on contemporary
poetry and the visual arts mostly but the de rigeur  kvetching will occur.
Recent poems by myself, Cyril Wong, Scott Keeney and  others can be found. Poems
on Rae Armantrout, Robert Pinsky and others abound.  Just teeming it is. I plan
on publishing poetry by others here a lot so hit me  up with some shiny new
poetry if interested. Merci,  Buffaloans

I have no such inhibitions as an editor of poetry, though I would
never publish my revisions without the author's solid agreement. I've
made numerous suggestions about almost every book published by
Junction Press, and I argue hard for them. But only if I've already
committed to publishing, so that the author can feel free to say no.
My interest is always in the poems becoming more the author's, not to
make them conform to my own practice. My authors have for the most
part been pleased with the process.

Then there's the case of a poem I published in my magazine of the
early 70s, Broadway Boogie. I proofread, of course, but then gave the
texts to the authors to proofread again. After publication one of the
poets noticed a typo--a one-letter difference in a word that made it
a different, plausible word. He was furious, and also frustrated that
he couldn't take it out on me, as he'd sgned off on the published
version. What made it worse was that the new word improved the
poem--every time he complained about it someone he trusted would tell
him "you know, it's pretty good this way." Years later, when he
included the poem in a collection, he kept the typo.

I've worked with editors - mostly, but not always, wonderful and generous
people - as a journalist, as a poet and as a novelist. I've also worked as a
subeditor on a daily newspaper, I've been poetry editor for two print mags
and I also edit an internet literary magazine. So I guess I could say I've a
fairly wide take on what it is.

Editing in a literary, as opposed to a journalistic, context is, as far as
I'm concerned, a collaborative exercise. I am incredibly grateful to the
excellent editors I have worked with (and continue to work with) for what
they have taught me about the discipline of writing. A good editor merely
heightens your own consciousness of your work and process. When the
relationship is good - and I have had ones that don't work, because
collaboration is like any other other human relationship, and some fail - it
makes me look a whole lot smarter than I am. I am not precious about my
work: if someone points out a way that it could be better, and I know in my
bones that they're right, I'll always take their advice.

But advice it is, not an order, and even the best and most empathetic
editors can be wrong, or can fail to understand something. From the other
end, it can be a delicate business offering advice to a writer, especially
someone you don't know. It can be misunderstood. The best editors always
know that the final decision is the writer's, and the only time I've ever
been pissed off with an editor was when she made some changes in a book
after I had signed off the final proof. That was crossing a line. Like any
relationship, editing only works under a condition of mutual trust.

If Jesse has been misrepresented here, and has not published work that was
changed without his contributors' permission, he deserves unreserved
apologies. I've no direct knowledge of what has happened, and that may be
the case. But if he has in fact done that, he's crossed that line, and it's
not sanctimonious to say it's unethical.

All best

Alison

Two things:

1.  I think one of the reasons that a lot of people are more willing to let
their prose essays/articles be edited beyond their control is that we tend
to see the subject or ideas of a prose piece as the point, whereas with
poems, the words themselves are the point.

2.  Didi Menendez mentioned the importance of guidelines.  It does seem like
a lot of this mess might have been avoided were there guidelines on the site
saying that people's poetry might be appear in altered form.  Since this
sort of editing seems to violate social norms, it probably is primarily the
editor's responsibility to explain that it will occur.

Communication: it's not just for kinky sex anymore.

In my view, Brian has it nailed, except that in the writing of most of my
essays I do not get paid either.

Lets move on to the next topic and next time reconsider who you are sending your poetry to. Read the guidelines. We (editors and publishers the same) spend a lot of time in making sure we make ourselves clear.

So stop throwing stones and look at what is in your hand next time and give it to a publisher who is clear and is professional.

  Following this discussion has made me glad Listenlght didn't accept
  the work I submitted. Apparently the editors didn't think my work was
  good enough (or malleable enough) to mutilate.

  Generally, I view editing as a 50-50 proposition. Sometimes it helps,
  sometimes it doesn't. Its biggest value comes when somebody saves me from
  making a complete fool of myself.

  While doing music journalism 17 years ago, I did have one particularly
  infuriating experience. I had written an article in which I mentioned that
  Hartford, Connecticut had a lively jazz scene. The editor changed
  my copy to say the scene resembled a Far Side cartoon.

  I don't mind corrections being made, or modifications made so that
  my piece conforms to "house style." But I do object to the change in
  meaning, especially since I was known for speaking my mind and standing
  by what I said. I hung out in the jazz clubs in those years and a few
  musicians didn't like what I had written before this incident.

  I told the editor I don't mind being edited, but that I stand by what I
  write and I was extremely displeased with making the changes without
  informing me.

  It was a commercial paper. I watched a lot of pieces get changed with no
  serious reason to complain. I was getting paid. But after that incident,
  I wrote one more article and moved on.

  I've moved on from Listenlight too.

  Subject: Re: listenlight magazine

  Good question. I'm a professional music and arts journalist by trade, and
  quite often see my pieces go to print with minor, once in awhile major,
  changes. Often I have approved these changes beforehand and made
  counter-changes to suit my editor, but this isn't always the case-- I've
  certainly had the experience of seeing a piece of mine go to print in a form
  I barely recognize. When I feel like an editor has changed my work in a way
  that misses the point, or obscures the point I was trying to make, I feel
  irritated-- not because the sanctity of my words has been violated, but
  because I would prefer to be involved in the process. I'm always willing to
  compropmise as long as I'm involved in the process, and I have some great
  editors who can make my pieces "better."

  But the "better" in question here relates mostly the market, to which music
  and literary criticism are explicitly tied-- i.e. in common review formats,
  reviews are linked to release dates, and the position of reviewer is in
  large part designed to position one as a consumer's advocate, tacitly
  advising what one should or should not spend money on. "Better" in this case
  means smoother, with a sturdier structure and more lucid language, more
  polished, etc. So to make changes to writing like this doesn't feel
  problematic to me, because that writing is already, to a degree, compromised
  by market imperatives. Whereas my poetry, which I seldom make money from
  (nor do I try to), and which does not bear the responsibility of conveying
  something true about a particular subject (one that, at one level, it is
  trying to *sell*), exists completely outside of the market. It has no
  interest in market imperatives toward lucidity, polish, saleability, etc. In
  fact, it works exactly against these imperatives, or strives to. For an
  editor to make it "better" misses its point of being a singular incarnation
  that has to be contended with for what it is, not another anonymous
  smooth-edged pebble in the rock garden of cultural capital.

  So for me, it's that simple-- when I'm selling my writing and my writing is
  by the nature of its format selling something else, deliberately or
  otherwise, it becomes a consumer product and subject to the consumer's
  demands-- and the to the editor's, who is paying me. But when it comes to my
  poetry, I don't owe anything to anyone-- in fact, it's a sphere I go to get
  away from all that.

I think that what is most distressing, and clearly this can be felt in Lisa's email (Let's go back to that email folks!), is that changes were made and lines added to work without the author being informed - and that that author is a student who might not otherwise feel empowered to voice his/her concern. I think that's what's problematic and do not think a discussing on editing habits, however informing, co-habitats the same space as what are Lisa's remarks related to Listenlight. Too, I wonder if by not questioning the ethics of Jesse's behavior, we are in fact giving credibility to a venture and individual many of us do not know well enough to support in this way. If things are so dog-eat-dog and editing as much about an unknown variant's vanity, then I am sorry to any young poet who's looking to be initiated into this field we call poetry. And I do not think this is throwing stones!

It's true, I don't think a discussion about editing "cohabits the same space" as the behavior Lisa reported. In fact, that is exactly why I initiated the new discussion--because I thought it had already been made abundantly clear that just about all of us found this behavior deplorable. That having been established, it didn't seem necessay keep belaboring the point, and I thought it might be better to move the discussion on to some something that we might be able to disagree on, i.e., have an interesting debate about. I certainly didn't mean to suggest that messing with other people's poetry is a trivial matter.

I think that's what's problematic and do not think a discussing on editing habits, however informing, co-habitats the same space as what are Lisa's remarks related to Listenlight. Too, I wonder if by not questioning the ethics of Jesse's behavior, we are in fact giving credibility to a venture and individual many of us do not know well enough to support in this way. If things are so dog-eat-dog and editing as much about an unknown variant's vanity, then I am sorry to any young poet who's looking to be initiated into this field we call poetry. And I do not think this is throwing stones!

I've got no dog in this fight, but this kind of muzzy-headed thinking is amazing.

Moral rights and legal rights are two different things. I agree that changing a
poet's poem without his or her approval is a violation of the author's moral
rights, but unless there's a law against it, it is NOT illegal. Is Alison asserting
there is a law against it? Cite the legal code, then, not the moral right. And
asserting that something is illegal when it is instead unethical is a dangerous
business, because even muzzier-headed people might think it's true.

Furthermore, all this talk of rights and legality and contracts regarding the
publication of poems -- what bullshit. Are there really people so harmed by
how their poems were presented that they sue? Are there really publishers so
harmed by a poem appearing in some other magazine or book that they sue?
Is there so much money sloshing around in the poetry business that people
are at each others' legal throats constantly, wrangling to get the best deal to
make the most money? It's crap. The poetry business is a gift economy. No
one makes any money in it. And if they did, if there were markets for poetry
then all the rules for editing prose would apply, as Mr Howe has suggested
they apply. If you were getting paid for your poems you'd have LESS, not
more, ability to say what got printed, just as when you're paid for a review or
other prose piece, you expect it will be edited for length, content, and they're
likely to change the title. Is that what you WANT in the poetry business? To
get paid enough so that editors can cut your poem, rearrange the stanzas or
paragraphs, have a re-write person add to it, change the title, and so forth?

Get real. The only reason poets can mouth off in such silly fashion is that no
one gives a rat's ass what a poet says or does. Poetry is the medium in which
you have the freedom to say what you please because no one is listening.

I would disagree, though, that  "sturdier structure and more lucid language, more polished, etc."  is merely a reflection of "compromise" with the market. When I do this kind of writing, I do so not submissively or cynically--not as a compromise--but as an exercise in a certain type of writing that has its own value, just as the other sorts of writing that I do, such as poetry, have their own, distinctive values. One could just as easily say that the "market" for poetry (a market in which the payment is not money but mere appearance) values ambiguity, rawness, lyricism, etc., and that anyone who writes poetry with such qualities is "compromising" with the poetry market.

  Also, with respect to my particular field of art criticism, one is not acting as a consumer advocate. Not to say that what we do is unrelated to the market--far from it--but in a different, less direct way. Only a tiny proportion of the readership of Artforum can actually afford to buy art (although of course the publishers might like the advertisers to imagine that the opposite is the case)--many more of them are artists, or even art students, than collectors.

  Speaking of markets, by the way, everyone should read a book by a Dutch economist who is also a practicing artist--"Why Are Artists Poor?" by Hans Abbing, published by University of Amsterdam Press.

I have poetry books to sell and would like to know a good venue or
method for doing so. a garage sale will take care of the other genres
but poetry, ah, not so commercially viable. we're moving and don't have
quite as much storage plus would welcome a few less boxes to haul.
perhaps proceeds can help finance the move  bit, too. the collection
consists mainly of a varied range of contemporary work, quite toothsome.
this is your opportunity to perform backchannel procedures, or you can
dole out the info front channel.
I welcome any clues.

Hello,

We're currently reading submissions for the third volume of "the ixnay reader," a yearly perfect-bound journal. We'll be reading submissions until July 31st. Up to 10 pgs of work can be sent to this email address (ixnaypress@verizon.net) or to our snail mail address:

ixnay c/o McCreary
1328 Tasker Street
Philadelphia PA 19148

The first two issues of the "reader" can be found as free pdfs on our new website, www.ixnaypress.com. Note that the "reader" tends to focus on a relatively small number of writers but gives each writer quite a bit of space.

Any questions? Please drop a line. Thanks muchly.

If you're in NYC, bring 'em down to Unnameable Books: We buy and sell used
and new books, and we like good poetry.

(We're at 456 Bergen St., btw. 5th Ave. and Flatbush, in central Brooklyn.
See www.unnameablebooks.net for more details)

If you're not in NYC, you might have a hard time finding a used bookstore
that appreciates the value of good poetry, but one might be very glad for
your collection...

good luck!  you can try amazon; you might sell one or two books;

you can donate to a local library for a tax deduction -- generally
don't just drop them off -- they'll pitch them or resell them at a
used book sale, donate as a special collection

This is also crap. I made a distinction between journalism and literature. I
write journalism (I am a theatre reviewer for the Australian, a daily
national newspaper) and I do not expect my deathless prose to be published
unchanged as a journalist, sure. That's why I don't have a lot of respect
for it. And I also make my living by writing commercial literature (ie books
that have sold upwards of 100,000 copies) as well as poetry. In those books,
I write what I decide, and the final edit is up to me, just as in poetry. My
right to have final say over the text is covered in the contract. And that's
standard.

Marcus, please don't display your ignorance so boorishly. "Moral rights" is
a legal term, and linked to copyright, as you would realise if you had
followed the link in my email. As I also said, it seems they don't exist in
the US; but they certainly exist - as a legal category - in other places,
and in the US they are covered by copyright.

So who's talking about suing? I wasn't.

Lisa, Andy,Alex, Barry, etal,

I was writing a long response to the question of editing. A section of it, =
I
think, was sent to the list prematurely by mistake. I decided not to finish
writing it. But since the discussion is still going on, here is what I was
intending to post:

"Editing" is the norm in mainstream publications. And if you object to it
you are being unreasonable or unprofessional. There is a logic to that
situation. Mainstream publications need to make money, and their editors do
believe they know what their readerships will find acceptable. The issue ha=
s
little to do with good or bad (though the editor may think it does)  but a
communality of taste.

Since in the publication of a poem profit is not often an issue, the
developed conventions are often different. The choice basically occurs in
the acceptance or rejection of a poem for publication.

I had occasional examples of editorial "input" or "interference" throughout
my writing life, all except for the first one during the publication of
books. My first ever publication of a translation (except in college) was
for a Turkish issue of The Literary Review over thirty years ago. The edito=
r
who had "discovered" me, and thought I would be a great translator,
completely butchered a translation of mine (Cemal S=FCreya's "In Your
Country") of which I was and still am very proud. I remember sitting next t=
o
him, downing shots after shots of scotch, and saying yes to all his
suggestions (no e-mails at that time). I felt absolutely sick. At the
publication of the Eda anthology thirty-five years afterwards, I used my
version. A poet friend of mine, who independently had known the earlier
version, commented what great improvements I had made in the poem in its
re-writing. Well... I told him what happened. The guest editor of The
Literary Review issue started accepting my translations with no changes
within two or three months, after seeing me translate Metin Eloglu's "The
Address of Turkey," which he had believed to be untranslatable. "In Your
Country" has other sides to its editorial history. The Literary Review
version was re-edited, this time by another editor, for The Penguin
Anthology of Turkish Verse, which came out in mid 1970's. My own version of
"In Your Country" also appears in totality in my long poem, "Turkish
Voices," this time its stanzas re-arranged and dispersed throughout the
poem. In this case, "editing" becomes a re-reading, opening the poem to
another, previously unwritten, text.

"Turkish Voices" experienced a greater respect from the editors. Robert
Hershon, the editor of Hanging Loose Press, wanted to publish the poem the
moment he heard me read the first third of it at The Poetry Project in 1990=
.
The "editorial board" kept the manuscript for about three months, at one
point asking me to write a letter explaining the poem. Finally, the board
rejected the poem, saying it was too "chaotic." Of course it was, gloriousl=
y
so; I had spent endless months trying to obtain that quality. (The Hanging
Loose board had the respect not to ask me or offer me to edit the poem.)
Most of the pieces in it have appeared in magazines, The Exquisite Corpse,
World, Trembling Ladders, Talisman, etc., including one third in the web); =
I
suppose the poems in isolation, not as a single poem, give up their quality
of chaos.

My adventures with Hanging Loose editors had been less drastic in the
publication of "I, Orhan Veli" in 1889. Hanging Loose selected about eighty
percent of the Orhan Veli poems I presented to them. They kept the poems
exactly in the order I presented them in the manuscripts. In two or three
poems, the copy editor (I think it was Dick Lourie) changed half a line. I
thought the changes were improvements and accepted them with no difficulty.
The remaining 20% of the Orhan Veli translations not in the original book
were published by Trembling Ladders in Australia ten years ago. The majorit=
y
of the same poems were re-published in the most recent issue of Talisman, i=
n
2007.

When Sun and Moon Press published the translations of Ece Ayhan's "A Blind
Cat Black and Orthodoxies," the editor Douglas Messerli kept the texts of
the translations completely intact. In the four to five page Afterwords,
which I wrote for the book, he removed the subtitles into which the
Afterwards was divided. In my essays, I have the tendency to use subtitles
in critical junctures, often involving an unexpected shift of direction, a
deflection, like the deflection from a stick half dipped in water. The
Afterwords was partially an expository piece, and Douglas felt the subtitle=
s
were unnecessary.

In the publication of "The Peripheral Space of Photography" by Green
Integer, the text was left intact. I remember in two or three places, he
suggested that I re-write the sentence because what I wanted to say was not
clear. I followed his advice.

In these instances, I have tried to show how a trust develops (or must
develop) from the publisher (editor) in the integrity, rightness of what th=
e
writer/poet is doing. In these cases, of course, financial considerations
are less paramount, and, most often, the publisher and editor are the same
person. (In the bigger, mainstream publishing houses, the functions are
split, weakening the aesthetic impulse, the aggressive element of editorial
choice.) Here, I will go even a step further: if a publisher commits to
publish a poet (writer), the commitment must be to all this poet's work,
with no editorial selection.This idea, which may seem strange, has two basi=
c
reasons. First, "editorial selection" implies that a poet's work consists o=
f
individual pieces. In my view, a poet's real achievement is in its totality=
,
the explorations, the obsessions, the solutions which run through his or he=
r
work. In that way, a more powerful poet's "failures" are more interesting
and absorbing and revealing that a lesser poet's successes. Second, finding
a publishing "home" releases a lot of energy for a poet, both chronological
and mental, creating a room of silence "of one's own" in which writing can
more easily occur. The argument that every work, including poems (except
when "first thought is best thought"), needs editing is unconvincing. Most
poets have already edited (by spending endless hours) their poems before
offering them to a publisher. The question is who is doing the editing.

My proposal (I admit, not particularly modest) may first appear to be takin=
g
away power, disenfranchising editor/publishers. The very reverse is true.
The power becomes strategic, rather than technical, focused around an
aggressive choice on the totality of a poet, which is a visionary act,
rather than on individual lines or poems. If one considers historically, on=
e
remembers those editors who made those choices or failed to make them, for
example, Mrs. Shakespeare with "Ulysses" or Maddox Ford, who decided to
publish D.H. Lawrence after having read only the first paragraph of one of
his short stories. Or, one can think of Andre Gide, who rejected Marcel
Proust's "A La Recherche"; I suppose he found the first paragraph of
"Swann's Way" completely uneditable. Or think of "Moby Dick," a totally
"bad" novel by any public standard of that time. In fact, "Moby Dick" is th=
e
eternal bad novel, with all its endless lists and so few, oh so few,
visionary narrative moments. Did the publishers of "Typee" and "Omoo"
publish "Moby Dick" or reject it?

I was planning to bring in a few more points I had on mind, but this is
enough; I have a few other things to do. I am not a scholar. I would like t=
o
know more about the  changing meaning and position of editor (or publisher)
through history. I would appreciate any comments along those lines.

Happy fourth of July, or whatever is left of this decrepit, sad and worn ou=
t
concept.

Ciao,

THE FIRST NOISE


No, it is not the intonation
It is not the rhythm
Not even the meaning.
It is the word by itself
Mouthless.
And who would ever care about
What the poet says?

What matters is the ritual
The metaphor of what we've always been
The memory of the first vocal sound
"the secret language of the birds
of the first day"

Today's man is out of tune
He has forgotten the words.
Someone stammers something
And everyone arrives, it's the ritual
The transition
Memory,
the substitution,
The endless metaphor
What strange analogy is man?

The poet says nothing
But a living being comes out of his throat
Invisible, having only sound
And an ancient music.
We remember then the original sound
The first sound in the world
When the word became blood
And collective food.

With time came verses
But the birds no longer cared about it
The poet speaks, sings or prays
And wants to name the world
In all forms.
He invokes the spirits
And calls the other
"I will people myself with voices," he says,
and turns to his metaphor which is of fire.

But the word keeps silent
The word is the grandfather of the species
The word is sense
It is power and walking stick.

Sanctimony aside, I think all anyone really wanted was to understand what,
on the surface, is an inscrutable and possibly shady situation. Perhaps
there's no intentional shadiness whatsoever, I'm open to that possibility.
As I said, my personal experience with Listenlight was positive. Lacking any
meaningful contribution from Listenlight's editor to this discussion,
though, we've only some startling allegations to go on. A little
transparency might help to dispel those shadows.

Or maybe it's all a wind-up. Now I'm thinking about starting a new poetry
journal called DEUS EX MACHINA-- I'll add a scene where Predator shows up
and decimates everyone/thing with unstoppable alien weapons at the end of
each published poem.

US Copyright law is laid out in title 17 of the US Common Code of Law.
In chapter 1 Section 106, it makes very clear that it is the exclusive
right of a copyright holder to reproduce copies of the copyrighted work
and to prepare derivative works based on the copyrighted work. Editing a
poem and printing the edited version without the author's agreement is a
violation of both rights, hence illegal.

I tried to post this one early yesterday evening, but
it didn't make it through somehow:

I'm sure that's good advice, Didi, and I'll take it in
general from now on.
  I sent stuff in because I liked the writing I found
in the magazine and
  the look of it.

Alex, it's not just Lisa's student. I knew that this
wasn't ok the moment I looked at the magazine, and
immediately wrote to the editor to ask what was up. I
didn't write anything about it here until it became
clear that the lack of response was more than a matter
of his not being able to get online, or some such
thing. If you look at back issues of the magazine,
you'll find some fairly well-established poets
there... the picture of naive and not-yet-empowered
beginners submitting their work to a mysterious online
entity isn't really accurate.

In reply to some of the other comments, most of what
needs to be said has been, but:
There's a major difference between the
question of how we
  think about editing in relation to our poems and the
question of basic
  tact and respect, and it's important not to blur
that difference.

  I love editing--it's a central part of composition
for me, not at all an
  afterthought. When I think the various stages of
editing and rewriting
  are done, I like showing the work to people whose
judgment I trust
  (including some who I know will make suggestions
counter to some
  of my intentions, whose aesthetic doesn't match
mine),
  seeing what they'll suggest, scratch out, scratch
their heads at, or
  appreciate that I hadn't noticed. I take some
suggestions, including
  some counterintuitive ones, and not others.

  My work isn't sacred in any way, but I do spend a
lot of time (on most
  poems, not all) considering it in all its details
from a lot of angles, on many scales. I also assume
that the poetry I read has had the same kind of care
brought to it, even though I know that isn't true in
the case of some writing I love and admire (say,
O'Hara's, which manifests  a different kind of care in
a different method). In any case, I think poets should
be treated as if they've thought about how they want
their poems to be. If someone (maybe anyone!) handed
me a radical rewrite of something I'd written, I'd
probably be interested, or even flattered, before I'd
be
offended. Someone publishing it that way without
informing me
 is a different story, and
can--functionally, not necessarily
psychologically--only add up to disrespect or
thoughtlessness.

The fact that such an act is never acceptable is to be
distinguished sharply from the possibility that the
editor is
an intelligent person with good intentions who cared
enough, in his or her way, to put in the work that
resulted in the uninvited edit.

cheers,

Andy

Jesse never contacted me at all about altering my work, but after reading
this thread and checking the site, I discovered that he has indeed altered
spacing, punctuation and one word change on poems submitted last year. He
didnt even ask, he just changed it and published! Who is this guy?  I cant
help thinking its a bit funny, but I guess its serious if you take this
stuff seriously.

re checking the guidelines etc, its no excuse to not send somebody work
because they dont post guidelines, it just communicates (at least to me)
what type of work to send. In other words, Im not surprised, I didnt send
anything I would consider my best work, just work that had yet to find a
home. But I do appreciate this thread and I dont think Jesse should be
"editing" anything. Seems like he would rather be writing more anyway...

i wonder if someone in the know about darwin and evolution could confirm or
deny the following.

there's an interesting talk by Steve Jones, professor of genetics at
University College London, at http://www.bath.ac.uk/podcast called "Why
creationism is wrong and evolution is right" in which he says that Darwin
got the notion of evolution (insofar as it is 'descent with modification')
from the work of Sir William Jones concerning the 'evolution' of language.

is it true that Darwin got the notion of evolution from Sir William Jones's
work on the 'evolution' of language?

ja?

Hi, all

I'm glad that some people are doubtful; skepticism and tentativity are always good in these situations.

Indeed, if what's been written here about Listenlight were false, it would amount not only to resentful, hostile, unacceptable treatment of another person, but also to libel, and Jesse would indeed be owed a serious public apology.

I'm happy to clear up whatever doubts I can. If you suspect me of hyperbole when I say that the revision of my submission was far more drastic than anything mentioned here (with the possible exception, in a different sense, of the "toon town" anecdote), I can send you the originals and the published version (now removed from the site).

(I can even discuss edits with you, or say why I don't think the rewrite is an improvement, despite the evident care with which Jesse rewrote my poem and that of another contributor).

A brief account of what happened is posted on my blog, and it's pretty easy to verify its accuracy.

I would HOPE, if Jesse (hi, Jesse) were being libeled, or even if someone were slanting the truth maliciously in order to damage his reputation, that he would respond directly, set the situation straight. I assume that the condescending, dismissive, indirect remarks he's posted here indicate that he doesn't contest the accuracy of these reports, but feels that he's in the right. If I thought that I was in the right, but that, given the facts, I had no chance of convincing anyone otherwise, I'd probably stay "above" the discussion as well.

Backchannel me about this if you like.

all the best,

Andy

You were talking about legality and law suits and enforcing the "moral rights"
of people -- and the only way that such private civil enforcement is going to
happen is if there is enough money involved in publishing poetry that there is a
market for it. That means, the only reason to be talking about legality and
enforcement is if there's something other than "moral rights" involved.
Otherwise, if all you're saying is "tsk tsk", well, then, it's just blather.

I live in a city where it's illegal, explicitly illegal, to shoot off a whole array of
fireworks in the city limits, and illegal to drink alcohol in open containers on the
streets or sidewalks, yet last night, there was the councilman, drinking a beer
on the sidewalk, directing the police to block off a street so people could shoot
off fireworks. Lots of illegal things are allowed de minimus and people
republishing poems, or editing them without permission, as well as shooting
off fireworks and drinking beer, are some of them.

The only way that this becomes an issue at law is if you, Alison, or other
individual poets, make it one by suing. Or if some editor somewhere sues you
for failing to properly credit his or her journal if you reprint the poem. So the
moment you start talking about "illegal" you start talking, necessarily, about
enforcement, and the only enforcement in the civil law is people suing each
other. You want to claim now that you said nothing about suing? Then you
have to accept that you said nothing of any interest or moment about the issue
at all.

Further, once either there is enough money to justify legal enforcement in the
poetry business that people _do_ start suing one another, then the editorial
conventions will start to change, and will change, because editors will
demand, and poets who want to be published _and paid for it_ will accede to,
editing poems as they edit prose: cutting things out, adding things in, changing
the title, and so on, to suit their _customer's_ tastes.

I think this topic has pretty well been covered. Just one corrective:
it's unlikely that anybody at the time criticized Moby Dick because
of the occasional lists (the prefatory matter and perhaps three
chapters) and the more than occasional digressions. In those regards
it's thoroughly in the tradition of Fielding and Sterne, both of whom
were universally read: the intrusive, wayward narrator was in no way unusual.

For the sake of mischief, a reminder that no less a figure than Pound
used to revise other's poems and publish them sans consultation. I
would have been furious, but there it is.

So you're talking about "moral rights" that don't exist in the US, but you spoke
broadly as if they applied universally, even though it did NOT apply to the vast
majority of the membership of the list is in the US where US law would apply?

Moral rights and legal rights are different things. Violating the one does not
necessarily violate the other.

This is disingenuous in the extreme. Why bother to talk about what's illegal
and what's not, much less about why, if you are not thinking about or talking
about remedies. What possible difference can it make if something is illegal or
not if you're not interested in the remedies and the process of getting the
remedies, that is, suing?

As soon as you start saying something in the civil law is illegal, you're talking
about suing -- because the state has no interest in the particular disputes
between the parties other than that they resolve their differences within the
civil and criminal laws. The state is not going to enforce your "moral rights" in
copyright law -- you have to enforce them by suing, or they go unenforced.
And unenforced laws are like no laws at all.

So many things to say about this one paragraph of yours. First, you make
your contempt for editing clear by placing the word in quotation marks.

And as someone whose job has been editing at various publications, one goal,
as with all for-profit businesses, has been to, well, turn a profit. The
issue of style and content has always been a good and bad issue, as well as
a readership issue, not one at the exclusion of the other. Hell, if you
write an article for Sports Illustrated on Turkish-American relations it
will be rejected, and a thread that doesn't go anywhere in a movie review
for a local community paper will be edited out, as well it should be.
Editing is also, of course, about style, and publications may adhere to a
greater style guide, AP at most places I've been, but then each place has
their own house style, too.

And Murat wrote again:

The only time in the 16 years I've been running boog where I could see this
holding true was with a lee ann brown chapbook we published in the summer of
1993, a museme. It contained 10 poems, one for each of the nine deities plus
one for their mom. There was a case where if I was going to put out that
chap it would only be with all 10 poems. Every other ms of poems, solicited
and unsolicited, hasn't come to me with an author's instructions that this
is the ms, every poem in this order, or I'll go elsewhere (and it isn't like
I'm only the only micro press in town). As I stated in an earlier reply to
this thread, I think an editor/publisher who gets work and puts it out
without an attempt to red pen it should just call themselves a printer.
Better yet Murat, why not cut out us middlemen, us editors and publishers,
and just put out yr work on yr own, then it'll come out just the way you'd
like, but, more than likely, not as good.

as ever,
david

Joseph Massey made me VERY HAPPY today forwarding a PDF of Ceravolo's long
out of print FITS OF DAWN, made me very very very fucking happy indeed!

You can see the cover on The PhillySound, as well as links to PENNSOUND's
Ceravolo page, which Eric Baus just alerted me to as well.  Go here:
http://PhillySound.blogspot.com

I for one am SICK AND TIRED of the poetry world publishing endless crap and
ignoring the fact that Ceravolo is out of print, except for the selected THE
GREEN LAKE IS AWAKE.  And no disrespect intended to the editors of the
selected, but it doesn't BEGIN to give us the total JOLT that is Joseph
Ceravolo!

Whose cock do I have to suck to get the COLLECTED Ceravolo published!  What
a ridiculous fucking world this is when I see some of the boring shit being
published in mass quantities and NO Ceravolo COLLECTED!

OY!  Makes my bad manners break loose!

With the preceding epigraph, the Poetics Listserv was founded by
Charles Bernstein in late 1993. Now in its fourth incarnation, the
list has over 1300 subscribers worldwide. We also have a substantial
number of nonsubscribing readers, who access the list through our web
site (see archive URL above).

The Poetics List is not a forum for a general discussion of poetry or
for the exchange of poems. Our aim is to support, inform, and extend
those directions in poetry that are committed to innovations,
renovations, and investigations of form and/or/as content, to the
questioning of received forms and styles, and to the creation of the
otherwise unimagined, untried, unexpected, improbable, and impossible.
While we recognize that other lists may sponsor other possibilities
for exchange, we request that those participating in this forum keep
in mind the specialized and focused nature of this project and respect
our decision to operate a moderated list. The Poetics List exists to
support and encourage divergent points of view on innovative forms of
modern and contemporary poetry and poetics, and we are committed to do
what is necessary to preserve this space for such dialog.

Due to the high number of subscribers, we no longer maintain the open
format with which the list began (at under 100 subscribers). The
specific form of moderation that we employ is a relatively fluid one:
in most cases, messages are reviewed after having been posted to the
list, and difficulties resolved on that basis; however, the listserv
editorial board may shift between this and a pre-review mode which
calls for all messages to be read and approved before being forwarded
to the list. We prefer to avoid this option as it hampers the
spontaneity of discussion that we hope to promote. In addition to
these options, the editorial board will unsubscribe individuals if
they are not, in our opinion, productively contributing to the list or
following our guidelines. We remain committed to this editorial
function as a defining element of the Poetics List.

Please also note that this is a not a general interest poetry list and
information about this list should not be posted to directories of
poetry lists. The idea is to keep the list membership to those with
specific engagement related to the list's stated orientation. The
current limits of the list are 75 messages per day, and a maximum of
four messages per subscriber per day; but these limits are subject to
change withouth notice.

In addition to being archived at through the EPC
(http://epc.buffalo.edu) and at
http://listserv.acsu.buffalo.edu/archives/poetics.html, some posts to
Poetics (especially reviews, obituary notices, announcements, etc.)
may also become part of specific EPC subject areas.

Note also that Roof Books published Joel Kuszai's edited collection of
the Poetics List; this is available from ROOF and also on line at the
EPC.


2. Posting to the List

The Poetics List is a moderated list. All messages are reviewed by the
editors in keeping with the goals of the list as articulated in this
Welcome Message (see section 1).

Please note that while this list is primarily concerned with
discussions of poetry and poetics, messages relating to politics and
political activism, film, art, media, and so forth are also welcome.
We strongly encourage subscribers to post information, including web
links, relating to publications (print and internet), reading series,
and blogs that they have coordinated, edited, published, or in which
they appear. Such announcements constitute a core function of this
list. Brief reviews of poetry events and publications (print or
digital) are always welcome.

We generally do not accept postings of creative work not directed
toward a discussion of poetics issues on the list. The Poetics List is
not a venue for the posting of free-standing, personal poems or
journal entries. However, the Poetics List editor may occasionally
solicit or approve poems for posting on the list.

Also, please note that the Poetics List is not a "chat" list and we
discourage the posting of  very short messages intended for only a few
subscribers.

All posts go out not only to list subscribers but also become a public
part of the list archive on the web. Note that posting to the list is
a form of publication and that by sending your message to the list you
formally consent to such web publication. Posts are currently being
indexed by search engines such as Google. It is not possible for us to
remove posts from the list archive or to control search engine
indexing of these posts.

Subscribers only may post to the Poetics List. Send messages directly
to the list address: poetics@listserv.buffalo.edu.


3. Subscriptions

*For all subscription requests go to
http://listserv.acsu.buffalo.edu/archives/poetics.html.

*To subscribe for the first time click on "Subscribe (join) a List."
Immediately following your subscription to the poetics listserv we ask
that you email poetics@buffalo.edu, subject-line "registration," with
your full name, street address, email address, and telephone number.
Failure to register at the time of subscription will result in
automatic deletion from the subscription roll.

*To manage your subscription (for descriptions of the different
subscription options please see section 3), click on "Subscriber's
Corner."

Subscriptions to the Poetics List are free of charge, but formal
registration is required. All other questions about subscriptions,
whether about an individual subscription or subscription policy,
should be addressed to this same administrative address.

PLEASE NOTE: All subscription-related information and correspondence
remains absolutely confidential.

All posts to the list must provide your full real name, as registered.
If there is any discrepancy between your full name as it appears in
the "from" line of the message header, please sign your post at the
bottom. Subscribers who do not include their full name with each post
will be unsubscribed form the list.

The most frequent problem with subscriptions is bounced messages. If
your system is often down or if you have a low disk quota, Poetics
messages may get bounced, which will result in your subscription being
automatically terminated by the Listserv program and the automatically
generated message telling you that this has occurred will also likely
bounce. If this happens, you may re-subscribe to the list by the same
process described above. One remedy to avoid this happening in the
future: set your list options to "no-mail" and read the list on the
web.

4. Subscription Options

We encourage you to alter your subscription options via the link on
the right side of the screen at
http://listserv.acsu.buffalo.edu/archives/poetics.html. If you would
prefer not to use the web-interface, you may also email
<listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu> the following commands:

*to subscribe to the Poetics listserv send
listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu this one-line message with no "subject":
sub poetics [your Firstname and Lastname]

*RECOMMENDED: if you wish to read the list on our web interface and
not receive any messages sent directly, while remaining subscribed to
the list and so eligible to send us posts, send this one-line message
to <listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu> with no "subject": set poetics
nomail. Note: this option is also useful for temporary suspension of
email service.

*to reactivate Poetics e-mail send <listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu>
this one-line message with no "subject": set poetics mail

* to receive the list in digest form (you will receive the day's
individual posts in one email sent just after midnight EST), send
<listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu> this one-line message with no
"subject": set poetics digest

*to receive posts in the default option (you will receive individual
postings immediately), send <listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu> this one-
line message with no "subject": set poetics nodigest

* to receive the list in index form (you will receive a list, without
the text of the posts, of the subjects discussed each day along with
the author's name and address and the number of lines it comprises;
you can also choose to have the index sent to you in either plain text
or in HTML format with hyperlinks), send
<listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu> this one-line message with no
"subject": set poetics nohtml index --or-- set poetics html index

PLEASE NOTE: do not leave your Poetics subscription in default or
digest mode if you are going to be away for any extended period of
time. Your account may become flooded and you may lose Poetics
messages as well as other important mail. In such cases, switch your
subscription to "nomail" as recommended above.

5. To Unsubscribe

To unsubscribe (or change any of your subscription options), again, we
strongly encourage you to go to the right-hand side of the screen at
http://listserv.acsu.buffalo.edu/archives/poetics.html You may also
may unsubscribe by sending a one-line email to
<listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu> with no "subject": unsub poetics

If you are having difficulty unsubscribing, please note: sometimes
your e-mail address may be changed slightly by your system
administrator. If this happens you will not be able to send messages
to Poetics or to unsubscribe, although you will continue to receive
mail from the Poetics List. To avoid this problem, unsub using your
old address, then resubscribe with your new email address.


6. Cautions

"Flame" messages will not be tolerated on the Poetics List. We define
'flaming' as any post that resembles a personal attack or personal
insult to anyone--subscriber or not. This of course includes racist,
sexist, or other slurs as well as ad hominem arguments in which the
person rather than their work is attacked; in other words while
critique of a person's work is welcome (critical inquiry is one of the
main functions of the list), this critique cannot extend to a critique
or criticism of the person.

The listserv is intended to be a productive communal space for
discussion and announcements; as such, subscribers who do not follow
listserv policy will be removed from the subscription roll.

In enforcing this policy, the editors must consider sometimes
competing interests. The basis for our decisions, however, rests with
our collective judgment about the kind of space we want for the list.

For reasons of basic security, we do not allow pseudonymous
subscriptions. All messages intended for the Poetics List should be
sent in Text-Only format, without attachments. We do not accept
HTML-formatted messages or attached files. As a general rule, keep
individual posts to 1,000 words or less.

Please do not publish list postings without the express permission of
the author. Posting on the list is a form of publication. Copyright
for all material posted on Poetics remains with the author; material
from this list and its archive may not be reproduced without the
author's permission, beyond the standard rights accorded by "fair use"
of published materials.

All material on the Poetics List remains the property of the authors;
before you reproduce this material, in whole or in part, we ask that
you get permission (by email is fine) from the authors. If they give
permission, then we ask only that you say that the post or posts
appeared originally on the Poetics List
(http://epc.buffalo.edu/poetics/welcome.html) on [give date and say:]
Used by permission of the author.

As an outside maximum, we will accept no more than 4 messages per day
from any one subscriber. Also, given that our goal is a manageable
list (manageable both for moderators and subscribers), the list
accepts 75 or fewer messages per day, though these paramenters may be
changed at the discretion of the list moderator.

Like all systems, the listserv will sometimes be down: if you feel
your message has been delayed or lost, *please wait at least one day
to see if it shows up*, then check the archive to be sure the message
is not posted there; if you still feel there is a problem, you may
wish to contact the editors at <poetics.list@gmail.com>.

Mischief, eh? Et tu, Mark? But seriously, I had a poem once published
online
in Wired (back in those days, yeah) as an "essay." I shrugged it off.
David
DelTredici once told me that Lenny Bernstein cut some nine minutes
out of
his (David's) orchestral piece called Tattoo, both in performance and in
recording. Bernstein routinely cut several minutes from Roy Harris's 3rd
Symphony, an American Classic. Writers are accustomed to having their
books pulped, thanks to Bill Clinton. What's new? Artists in all
fields are
at the mercy of the commodifiers. The solution? Do it yourself. Write
the
book, print it, distribute it, even review and blurb it yourself. The
way
of the future (and some of the past). Don't you love it? I do.
Thanks, Walt!

David,

The quotation marks does not imply contempt. The marks imply that what is
the norm in mainstream publications is not the only conceivable way of
publishing.What makes so in mainstream is money. There are editors who think
very differently from the way you do, where making money is not their
primary concern. I can name a number in our time.

Here again we come to the issue of a specific market (readership, audience),
which of course makes the prospect of profit possible. Within such a more or
less specified market, the concept of good or bad also becomes more or less
specified, in other words, natural. What I was talking about is a situation
(an it is the situation of poetry as I see it) where this market (audience)
is blurred, undefined, in purely commercial terms, non-existent. Here, the
idea of editorship changes, becomes transformed. If the definition of an
audience is blurred, the absoluteness of good or bad is also blurred -the
latter becoming increasingly an ideal, a trusted goal postponed to the
future. I assume that is what experimentation is. In such a situation, how
does an editor gain authority over the poet? Which you seem to apply.

Once the poet accepts that he or she will make no money out of his or hear
endeavors, this will provide the poet with a lot of freedom. Of course, the
editor has the freedom to reject the work, and the poet to submit it
somewhere else, or to publish it himself or herself (a prattice with a
honorable history).

My point is not statistical but conceptual. Undoubtedly, in the majority of
publications an editorial process occurs; it occurred in mine. Most of the
time, I accepted many of the suggestions without a problem. I did not submit
my manuscripts with a cover letter of instructions either, saying, "this is
the manuscript and its order, take it or leave it or else." But, once the
publisher accepted the work (he may make it conditional on some changes,
which the poet may or may not accept), he basically respected its integrity.
As I said in my earlier post, I believe in the totality of a writer's work,
where shape is very significant. You have sensed it yourself in Lee Ann's
poem.


As I stated in an earlier reply to

Why should "red pen" be what separates  an editor from a printer? Wouldn't
the choice of a writer -one unnoticed or rejected by other publishers- be
the sign of a truly perceptive editor?

To me the idea that editors "improve" the writers' work is very problematic.
I know there is the example of Thomas Wolfe. I don't think most poets are
lazy bums or rube geniuses needing to be rescued from themselves. I wonder
what Alan Sondheim feels about being edited?

I would like also to bring up the issue of The Waste Land, the
quintessential editorial intrusion in modern poetry, no doubt a huge
improvement on the early versions of the poem before Ezra Pound touched it.
On the other hand, as I see it, The Waste Land is an anomaly in T. S.
Eliot's work. The collage structure of the poem had not been used by him
before, and he drops it after the poem. The Waste Land is considered Eliot's
masterpiece, particularly by those who do not very much like his work. My
impression is that among those who have affection for his work, and I am one
of them, the poems which really touch them are Prufrock and The Four
Quartets (the latter being maybe the most disliked work by the opposite
side).

Ciao,

Murat

Jim, here is a link that might help if you haven't already found it.
_http://www.the-scientist.com/2004/12/20/16/1/_
(http://www.the-scientist.com/2004/12/20/16/1/)     It references the linguistic evolution thing re Darwin. A book
that I found  REALLY interesting w/ regard to a revisionist view on evolution
(straight Darwinism seems mechanistic and 19th century) came from an unlikely
source: Arthur Koestler. His Ghost in the Machine, a result of his year spent
in  an interdisciplinary think tank enviroment, questions some of the central
 premises in straight Darwinian evolutionary theory, and offers tantalizing
glimpses of things like recapitulationary evolution (reculer pour mieux
sauter),  and directed evolution of sorts....he gives beaucoup evidence, including
parallel evolutions of mammalian and marsupial species on continents separated
 eons ago. The chapter on homology is particularly beautiful, in a
mathematical sort of way.  Makes you wonder if all that "extraneous"  material in genes
we think are meaningless are really what we think.

He may be pushing it. There was a fair amount of work motivated by
the growing awaremness of similarities between things which
nonetheless had become different over long periods of time. Jones'
observations were one of them. Did Darwin also know Grimm's Law? He
certainly was aware of Lamarck, which posited evolution but got the
mechanism way wrong, and, most important, he carried Lyell's geology
texts with him on the Beagle. Lyell demonstrated the earth's
antiquity and the existence of major transformations from the
accretion of small changes. He almost certainly didn't know Mendel's
work, which he would have found useful.

Every farmer knew about selective breeding--it was in fact a fad in
the 18th and 19th centuries, as witnessed by all the portraits of
grotesquely improbable pigs. Darwin's great insight was that randomly
generated traits within groups of animals in isolation from other
members of their species  would accumulate to the point that the
group would differentiate not just into a strange pig but into a new
species entirely if those traits gave individuals carrying them a
reproductive advantage by helping them, for instance, secure
nutrition or resist predation. The environment, in other words, acted
as the selector from among the available traits.

This didn't come from Jones (whose basic insight had been at any rate
anticipated by a good century) or Lyell or Grimm, and it remains
unchallenged (except for the tweaking of details and an ever more
sophisticated understanding of the genetic mechanism).

a very good poet , artist, musician--has long been neglected while heaps of=
 medioctiry have been monumentalized and canonized--to suddenly bring forth=

 vaguely uneasy--why weren't they told about this person before???--"the bl=

 it--from a nobody a person can become a very important somebody--esp if th=
ey are dead!and who they were and what their work is can be formed in the p=

Marcus, straw men are burning everywhere. Did you read anything I actually
wrote? I wasn't offering an opinion, just stating a commonly known legal
fact, which in fact pertains in America under copyright law. Look it up:
"moral rights" is a legal term. It's printed in the front of my published
books. And, for the second time, no one was talking about suing. It's a good
idea, no, for people to know their rights?

Steve, as the author, you hold the copyright of anything you write by
default.

I have never been an artist who likes tugging my forelock or who feels that
I ought to be so grateful to be published that I will allow my work to be
bastardised for the sake of it; I have withdrawn poems from prestigious
print journals if it seems that changing it against my better judgment is
part of the deal. I do not accept my work being treated with disrespect by
any publisher, and no writer should. And it happens that in seeking to
protect the work as I intend it to be, the law is on my side.

Murat, your idea of editing poetry is roughly speaking my policy at
Masthead. I am responsible for shaping an issue and choosing the work that
will go into it, and I will pick up what looks like typos or mistakes (we
all make them) and very occasionally make suggestions in consultation with
the author; but I feel that if I invite someone to contribute, I do so on
good faith, because I like this work I have asked for. If I accept a poem, I
publish the poem I have accepted, and I prefer to publish a number of poems
by any particular author, to give (however small) an idea of range and
sensibility.

However, I don't agree that in more commercial circumstances editing is
always without integrity or solely driven by commercial considerations. I'm
as proud of my popular novels and take them as seriously as my poetry; in a
funny way, what interests me about both, aside from the obvious desire that
drives any work, is a question of formal intrigue: how possible is it to
subvert generic form without breaking it, say, in the case of writing genre
literature. I've encountered many degrees and means of editorial
interference; for example, my US publisher - in a major but independent
publishing house - is also my editor (an exception, rather than a rule, I
agree, but it does happen) and they've never been anything but respectful.
I've had my rows with commercial publishers (Penguin) and in fact won them.
If I had not been an experienced writer, though, and a stubborn one, it
might have been a different story. I have a lot of thoughts about bad
editing and how deleterious it can be for a developing writer, but I won't
go into them here.

Like Andy, I enjoy editing, self-generated or otherwise, and it's always
been an important part of my process.

All best

Thanks, W.B. I see the article you refer to is available in its entirety at
http://www3.isrl.uiuc.edu/~junwang4/langev/localcopy/newsreport/2004-12-darw
in-meets-chomsky.txt . It begins with a quote from Darwin:

"The formation of different languages and of distinct species and the proofs
that both have developed through a gradual process are clearly the same."

And thanks also to Mark, who points out that the antecedants of the idea of
evolution are various, not simply William Jones's work on the evolution of
languages.

It is of course no surprise that we and language are subject to similar
processes, but there is something beautiful in the historical link between
Darwin's idea of the evolution of species and the evolution of languages.

The study of language has expanded so profoundly in a hundred and fifty
years. Language, in the theory of computation, has about the same role as
particle systems in physics. And, just as twentieth century science was
dominated by physics, so it seems the twenty first will be by studies deeply
involving language. Such as computation, genetics, and other types of
information.

Yet, in most cases, apparently language/information/grammar without a
sentient author.

Fascinating notions of poetry therein.

MIME-Version: 1.0

Hi folks, does anyone know how I would go about contacting Andre Breton's estate about use of his poems and what they'd expect as far as remuneration goes? I've been working on some procedural translations based on a method I developed and had good results with on Rimbaud's Une Saison en Enfer, which I'm hoping to publish through Wet Asphalt press and have no worries about since rimbaud is all public domain.

Anyhow I started toying around with Breton translations because while my French is really pretty mediocre, i'd been so pleased with my Rimbaud results, i wanted to try the technique on my other favorite francophone. Any way, some of my efforts have been better than others, but I just finished work on a translation of L'union libre last night that I'm frankly thrilled with and I'd like to see the light of day sometime before Breton's nachlass becomes public domain in 2042. Any advice from those of you who are real translators as compared to bonehead poseurs like me?

Actually, under the US Copyright law, any work is copyright by its creator

Though we might quibble over semantics, I think we can all agree that

Just out of curiosity, Alison, do you publish your novels under the same name, or do you have a different "identity" when you write them?

MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII; format=flowed

Billowing and sovereignty


(From a letter) " - sometime would like to talk to you about this notion,
the 'smoothed' lifeworld and the 'peering' around corners that I think
constitutes memory and suturing - almost a form of billowing - I think
this could be a useful concept for me. softness embraces both mental
phenomena, mind, and the receiving, receptacle, organizing of things,
identifying of things, surrounding of things, in the personal world and
its extension, i.e. the 'peering' of the personal world. it's difficult to
come to grips with the 'depth' of the real, that lip when classification
is just beginning or just forgotten - when the real seems of a comfort,
presencing ... "

in billowing, the particulate disappears. stratigraphy loses the anecdote
among the sublime. neither singular nor plural. nor something revealed -
it would be easy, yes, to think through the sublime as a matter of revela-
tion, next stop on the mystical train. but there's no vector, no plateau,
no buddhas seated or otherwise, no intentional or contradictory language.

the particular is the particular is asthmatic, urban dis-ease, the body at
war, not with itself, but with differentiation. towards death distinctions
disappear. there is no other side.

"MR. KING [said] [...] The States were not 'Sovereigns' in the sense
contended for by some. They did not possess the peculiar features of
sovereignty, they could not make war, nor peace, nor alliances nor
treaties. Considering them as political Beings, they were dumb, for they
could not speak to any foreign Sovereign whatever. They were deaf, for
they could not hear any propositions from such Sovereign. They had not
even the organs or faculties of defence or offence, for they could not of
themselves raise crops, or equip vessels, for war." [...]

"MR. MARTIN, said he considered that the separation from G.B. placed the
13 States in a state of Nature towards each other; that they would have
remained in that state till this time, but for the confederation" [...]

(from Notes of Debates in the Federal Convention of 1787 reported by James
Madison)

in a state of nature States jostle, states and operators jostle, processes
jostle. nothing speaks unless spoken-to, when something speaking is speak-
ing as spoken-for. from such collusion, collocations, rights arise through
the etic; the emic, interiority, withdraws so that the membrane cloaks
everything except digital transmissions - goods, speech, currencies, move-
ment of men, materiel. in a state of nature, States billow forth, swell,
breathe, engender, Mona Lisa smile.

are songs sung? look, I'm putting forward a myth, not of origins nor of
destinations, a myth of wayfarers, neither mapped nor mapping nor nomadic.
look, I'm writing to you, here, see, in the absolute silence of protocols,
which, along of all the things, processes, states, and operators, are
soundless in the world.

look, she said, did we ever have a government.

Or, to put it another way, we may have entered a period when the
rather imprecise metaphoric identification of all symbolic systems as
language may obscure the profound differences between them.

Hello.

Just wanted to let people know that I recently had a book/CD released
by Narrow House Recordings, There Were One and It Was Two; Annotated
Artifacts from the Doubles Museum. John Berndt provides sound on the
cd.

You can find it here on my website: http://ricroyer.com/therewereone.htm
The webpage has photos from the release event, Baltimore City Paper
review and info about the project.

It will be available exclusively at Normals Books and Records in
Baltimore for the month of July.  After July it will be available at
other places.

Briefly, the piece is about the double in all of its funny, uncanny
and frightening forms. There is a full description on the website.

You will like it. You will. oh you will.

At the moment, we have too much government for the wrong things.  Health care for all should replace the Iraq war and all future wars.  I really liked the beginning of your piece here but when it got into politics, it lowered itself a bit I'm afraid.  The nature of reality will always be more interesting than George W.

Disingenuous again -- you were "just stating" in context, and the context =
made
it an offering of your opinion -- else why speak at all? There was no ques=
tion
about what was legal and what wasn't; the question was what was ethical, n=
ot
what was legal. You dragged the law into a discussion of ethics and, like
Thrasymachus, your opinion is inadequate.

In the civil law if you want to talk about "illegal" you're talking enforc=
ement, and
enforcement means lawsuits. Otherwise you're blowing smoke. If you say you=

were not talking suing, not talking lawsuits, then you were not talking ab=
out
anything worth talking about. There are no copyright cops reading the poet=
ry
magazines, looking for editors who change a poet's words, or looking for
poets who fail to acknowledge the journals a poem has previously appeared
in. When you start talking "legal", whether you're right or wrong, in the =
civil law
you're talking lawsuits, or you're not talking about anything, you're just=

blathering.

Since you insist you were not talking about suing, then I'll take it you r=
ealize
you were just blathering.

This is true -- but it's also irrelevant in a gift economy such as the poe=
try
business. It doesn't matter a whit unless you get hired to write lyrics fo=
r Les
Mis or Candide, or hired to do any writing, for that matter. Then who owns=
 the
copyright matters, sure, and it's good if you get hired to do that kind of=
 writing
that you consult an attorney and get the contract looked over closely. Fai=
ling
that, however, in the gift economy of poetry, all poets really want is to =
get their
poems out into the journals, books, and anthologies. There's no money in i=
t,
and as far as I know there's only been one case in living memory where
someone was publishing someone else's poems as their own by changing the
title and claiming them. Neither are editors unscrupulously minting money =
by
publishing poems and failing to tell the poets. Neither are the poets slyl=
y
getting rich by getting paid for the same poem sent out to journal after j=
ournal.

The whole thing, the whole notion of "legality" in a gift economy, is irre=
levant.
What poets want is credit for having written the thing; what editors want =
is
credit for having published it. Even if a poem is attributed to the wrong =
poet, or
a poem appears in two different journals, or any of that kind of thing, th=
e law
sees it as de minimus, and the law takes no notice of trivial things.

Neither do the poets and editors sue each other, or even threaten it. The
entire discussion about what's "legal" and what's not in the poetry gift
economy is trivial and silly because no poet wants to be known as the poet=

who sues editors, and no editor wants to be known as the editor who sues
poets. It's a gift economy where goodwill is all there is, where there's n=
ot
enough cash value in the dispute to say "Fuck goodwill, show me the money"=
.

Even to talk about what's legal and what's not in a goodwill gift economy =
is to
raise the spectre of lawsuit because it just doesn't matter what's legal a=
nd
what's not in circumstances where the law takes no notice of the matter, a=
nd
would likely regard any lawsuit on the issue as de minimus.

But once you start to get strident about what's legal in the civil law, yo=
u're
talking remedies, you're talking enforcement, you're talking lawsuit -- be=
cause
if you're not, then you're just not talking about any thing significant at=
 all.

The law is irrelevant to the case because you can withdraw the poem and th=
ey
can refuse to publish it -- and that's all there is to it. No question of =
law arises!
No one makes any money worth fighting through the courts about by
publishing poems, from either the writing or the publishing side. And if t=
here
were enough money to fight about, then the editors and publishers would wi=
n,
and you'd have to accept either being edited in your poetry work just as y=
ou
accept being edited in your journalism work, and for the same reasons:
because the editors and publishers claim to know what the audience wants
and how they want it, and they give it to them that way. And if you don't =
want
to let them edit your work as it must be edited to sell, then they'll get =
someone
else to write it -- just like journalism.

You seem to fail to see the important issue here: that the reason that poe=
ts
can say "My way or no way" is that editors have no audience that they have=
 to
pander to for money, and thus no motivation worth speaking of to try to
compel poets to change their work. In short, the sad fact remains that poe=
ts
can say what they please because no one is listening.

Alison,

I do not assign lack of integrity to editors of commercial publications.
They have to do what they have to do, but their interests do not necessarily
correspond to mine. They may do so for completely moral purposes, even
believing they are improving the work. In terms of acceptance by the
readership, the editor may even be right. But I may not be writing for a
maximum number of readership, but for another reason. Perhaps one has
something one needs to say and a specific way of saying it. The way of
saying is as salient as the substance. Given the sacrifices in readership
the poet has usually to make (or is willing to make or risks to make), I
think he or she has the freedom to choose. What I do not like is adjectives
like non-professionalism or capriciousness or naivete or foolishness applied
to such behavior. Sometimes, I myself initiate the query whether the
editor/publisher has an opinion about a specific line or passage, but it is
all do within
a framework of respect.

What you say about genre works is very true, and movies contain many great
examples of that. My quite long post on Hitchcock's movies about two weeks
ago (including the "errors" in them) are partly about this process. I
finished half of a detailed response to Alan Sondheim's final question in
that thread. I did not have  time to finish the rest. I hope Alan did not
mind. I will finish it soon and post it.

Alison, my experience with commercial publication -specifically due to that
split between editor and publisher- was very unhappy. The French
photographer French photographer asked me to write texts for fifteen
photographers of Jews around the world, along with another twenty-four
people. I described the project in greater detail during the thread about
photography I just mentioned. I spent almost a year on those fifteen texts,
spinning the idea of invisibility in photography, speculatively relating it
to the Biblical junction, "Thou shalt not worship graven images." Both the
editor and Frederic were happy and very excited about them.

Then Frederic sold the entire project (two volumes, one consisting of his
photographs and second of photographs surrounded by texts) to HarperCollins.
The latter had other ideas about the project: to sell it as a collection of
"high art" photographs and picturesque commentaries (tea pots, exotic
clothing, etc.). The publication was kicked off with an exhibition at The
Brooklyn Museum in New York next to Rodin sculptures -sadly. through the
inflation, underplaying Frederic's very fine eye.

HarperCollins assigned a free lance editor (one time working at The New
Yorker) to the project. She was a very nice person and a concerned,
sensitive editor, trying to reach a compromise, acceptable bridge between
the HarperCollins editorial board -for whom a lot of this writing (at least
my own) was beyond the pale- and me. She partly succeeded. Six of the pieces
-in somewhat altered forms- entered the book. Six was I think the limit put
by HarperCollins on all the writers. The fact is that what appeared in the
book has nothing to do with I had written. Having already been paid by
Frederic -from another account- a year before, I had no ownership of those
pieces. The spirit of sustained exploration running throug the pieces -and I
think through Frederic's own photos- was replaced by a bombastic, gumutlich
project. In my opinion, that result was inevitable once Frederic Brenner
chose to use a big power mainstream publisher, rather than more modest one.
I am sure he made more money; I also believe the editorial decisions
HarperCollins made, including cutting down the number of text, were right to
bring across "significant Jewish art and culture." I experienced the whole
thing as a disaster. Those pieces are waiting for their place to be visible.

conrad,

let the bad manners fly on this one -- it's really shameful, the continuing
neglect of ceravolo's work. and for all that was excluded from that recent
selected, which now also is out of print. fits of dawn is indeed a wonder,
which only makes one want a collected poems even more. it's can't be a huge
book -- tho i heard a rumor that later in his life he wrote an extensive
series of catholic/devotional poetry -- anyone back this up?

if i had a nickel for every o'hara or ashbery disciple out there i'd gladly
trade it all for a small school of ceravolo and i'd still be richer!

is anyone in contact with ceravolo's wife/estate?

allbests,

It's just that we people from Canada, Mexico, Argentina, Bolivia,
Panama, etc.
wonder how come the people in the US call their one country "America."
Why
not go a little further and call it "The World"? Well, I guess that
does happen--
while watching a baseball game on TV lately, I heard an announcer refer
to the
"World Champion St. Louis Cardinals." This despite the Japanese baseball
team winning the World Championship in a game against Cuba.

I'm not sure what politics you're reading into the text. What was and
still is of interest is the idea of mute/state of Nature political
entities, as if there were inchoate forms that were only capable of
organization within/beneath an Absolute. Bush is nowhere to be found in
the text. On the other hand, Madison's notes are fascinating since they
indicate the phenomenology of birth in a sense - just as the Federalist
and anti-Federalist papers give voice to its conclusion. - Alan

> Disingenuous again --

I am now on three different poetry-related listservs to which Mr. Bales
is, or has been, subscribed. Based on this experience, I've been trying to
work out a drinking game -- for example, the most obvious occasion for
taking a drink is when Marcus accuses someone of being disingenuous. The
problem, however, is that he flings this word around with such giddy
abandon that you could easily get sloshed before the day is half over.
Obviously there are still a few bugs in the system.

Back to trying to find a copy of the Joseph Ceravolo PDF, because I think
"caribou" is more of a word to conjure with than "disingenuous" --

There are many rumors that Ceravolo's wife is the problem.  I've heard this
from several people.  But I've also heard marvelous stories about her from
my friend John Coletti who has been to see her, and she gave him copies of
books, beautiful, rare gifts, and stories, and how nice is that?  Very nice!

What would it take?

What plot to loosen the valve on all that Love?

Has no one any charm left?

Silly, of course!  Much charm to go around, right?!!!!  Hm, well, what's

right?!!!!

Dear publishers:
May we please have your attention? Or at this late hour, must we DEMAND
your attention?!!! With this one, new PDF available for FITS OF DAWN by Mr.
Ceravolo, I've received more than 80 requests, and that in less than 24
hours! And that of course does not include the hundreds of others already
getting it from Joseph Massey and others!

There are so many of us who Love his work. And there are a host of living

You have a fucking guaranteed audience and Love here, so WHAT ARE YOU
WAITING FOR!?

And when it comes out, PLEASE be wise enough to invite Simon Pettet to
read! Simon Pettet's extraordinary tenderness for the work is inimitable,
and literally sets the poems on a track inside the audience straight from
ear to heart. Corny as you may think I am for saying so, it's true.

Be wise, be clear, be the one to chip the ice away, please! Joseph Ceravolo
is a No coffin!

Marcus, since you present yourself as being expert in legal matters, and since you also express disdain for those you see as opining on such matters with inadequate knowledge--perhaps you can clear up a curiosity of mine:

  It seems to me that if poets don't sue, it's because they don't believe they can afford to do so. But let's say a publisher mangled the work I'd entrusted him with in this gift economy of ours, and I decided I could afford to sue (let's pretend I was James Merrill, for instance, only alive)--would I have a case? Or would the fact that I had suffered no financial damage through the misplublication of my work mean that I had nothing to sue for? In other words, do you think I could claim damages just because of the misrepresentation of the work itself, or must I claim some actual or potential financial loss? (Just to make it clear, this is a hypothetical instance.)

  By the way, do you really have to sue to take legal action? Isn't just threatening to sue often enough to get your way?

  Maybe such things happen more in the UK poetry world than the US one. I remember reading an obit of Gael Turnbull which mentioned that early on, he had invited Philip Larkin to contribute to a publication he was editing. Larkin obliged, but when he realized that this was to be an "avant-garde" publication, he had his lawyer send a letter demanding the return of the poems, unpublished--and of course Turnbull did so. Also, I've been told that Ian Hamilton Finlay sued the great Fulcrum Press over an edition of his work that they'd published, and that this was part of the reason why the press folded. However, I don't know that this is true. In an interview in Jacket in 2001, Finlay was asked about this and did not mention a lawsuit:

  "The dispute with Fulcrum Press was quite bizarre. The Dancers Inherit The Party had been published twice, and Fulcrum Press asked if they could publish it again and, after I had signed the contract, they informed me that they intended to describe it as a first edition. But it patently was not a first edition, it was a third edition. At this point I wrote to the Arts Council of Great Britain because they gave a grant to the publisher and I said public money shouldn’t be used to subsidise fraudulent editions. This is very clear and quite simple, but they wrote back to me very rudely telling me to mind your own business, and things like that.
     "So, I wrote to the Scottish Arts Council, which had short-listed the second edition of the book for a prize two years before. They told me that if London says that it is a first edition then it must be a first edition. Then I wrote to the Association of Little Presses and they said something like; ‘You’re selfishly spoiling a good racket’, because you get more money for the first edition! I found all this extraordinary!
      "Then I got the parliamentary ombudsman to make an investigation and he consulted the British Museum who confirmed that the book couldn’t be a first edition. But when they were asked to say that publicly, they refused to do so. The National Library of Scotland, a copyright library which received editions of all my books, also refused to say anything. It is extraordinary that something so clear could be deliberately ignored like this. My position was really quite simple, I didn’t wish to take part in a fraud on the public. But at that time most poets either were published by Fulcrum, or wished to be published by Fulcrum, so they seemed to consider me a danger, and after six years I was completely isolated. Nobody spoke to me anymore, and people were saying ‘it is not nice to fight’ and all this kind of thing.
     "So, then, I went to the Consumer Protection Department which sent the book to Sotheby’s whose expert on literary fraud, a man called Carter, said that it could not be a first edition, took the publisher to court, and got the ruling that I was right. It then took the Arts Council Of Great Britain a further two years to accept the court ruling and to apologise to me. But I was never forgiven, I was always reminded that I did something terrible. The fact that I was proven right counted for nothing at all. What people remembered was that I had cause a lot of trouble to these institutions by asking them to stand up and speak a simple truth. But it was very instructive to me! This was when I first realised what culture is."

Disingenuous again -- you were "just stating" in context, and the context made
it an offering of your opinion -- else why speak at all? There was no question
about what was legal and what wasn't; the question was what was ethical, not
what was legal. You dragged the law into a discussion of ethics and, like
Thrasymachus, your opinion is inadequate.

In the civil law if you want to talk about "illegal" you're talking enforcement, and
enforcement means lawsuits. Otherwise you're blowing smoke. If you say you
were not talking suing, not talking lawsuits, then you were not talking about
anything worth talking about. There are no copyright cops reading the poetry
magazines, looking for editors who change a poet's words, or looking for
poets who fail to acknowledge the journals a poem has previously appeared
in. When you start talking "legal", whether you're right or wrong, in the civil law
you're talking lawsuits, or you're not talking about anything, you're just
blathering.

Since you insist you were not talking about suing, then I'll take it you realize
you were just blathering.

This is true -- but it's also irrelevant in a gift economy such as the poetry
business. It doesn't matter a whit unless you get hired to write lyrics for Les
Mis or Candide, or hired to do any writing, for that matter. Then who owns the
copyright matters, sure, and it's good if you get hired to do that kind of writing
that you consult an attorney and get the contract looked over closely. Failing
that, however, in the gift economy of poetry, all poets really want is to get their
poems out into the journals, books, and anthologies. There's no money in it,
and as far as I know there's only been one case in living memory where
someone was publishing someone else's poems as their own by changing the
title and claiming them. Neither are editors unscrupulously minting money by
publishing poems and failing to tell the poets. Neither are the poets slyly
getting rich by getting paid for the same poem sent out to journal after journal.

The whole thing, the whole notion of "legality" in a gift economy, is irrelevant.
What poets want is credit for having written the thing; what editors want is
credit for having published it. Even if a poem is attributed to the wrong poet, or
a poem appears in two different journals, or any of that kind of thing, the law
sees it as de minimus, and the law takes no notice of trivial things.

Neither do the poets and editors sue each other, or even threaten it. The
entire discussion about what's "legal" and what's not in the poetry gift
economy is trivial and silly because no poet wants to be known as the poet
who sues editors, and no editor wants to be known as the editor who sues
poets. It's a gift economy where goodwill is all there is, where there's not
enough cash value in the dispute to say "Fuck goodwill, show me the money".

Even to talk about what's legal and what's not in a goodwill gift economy is to
raise the spectre of lawsuit because it just doesn't matter what's legal and
what's not in circumstances where the law takes no notice of the matter, and
would likely regard any lawsuit on the issue as de minimus.

But once you start to get strident about what's legal in the civil law, you're
talking remedies, you're talking enforcement, you're talking lawsuit -- because
if you're not, then you're just not talking about any thing significant at all.

The law is irrelevant to the case because you can withdraw the poem and they
can refuse to publish it -- and that's all there is to it. No question of law arises!
No one makes any money worth fighting through the courts about by
publishing poems, from either the writing or the publishing side. And if there
were enough money to fight about, then the editors and publishers would win,
and you'd have to accept either being edited in your poetry work just as you
accept being edited in your journalism work, and for the same reasons:
because the editors and publishers claim to know what the audience wants
and how they want it, and they give it to them that way. And if you don't want
to let them edit your work as it must be edited to sell, then they'll get someone
else to write it -- just like journalism.

You seem to fail to see the important issue here: that the reason that poets
can say "My way or no way" is that editors have no audience that they have to
pander to for money, and thus no motivation worth speaking of to try to
compel poets to change their work. In short, the sad fact remains that poets
can say what they please because no one is listening.

Tom,

Yes, Cerevolo did write devotional poetry towards the end of his life. I
heard passages from it in a reading at The Poetry Project, attended by his
family and many New York poets, memorializing him.

I had wondered why the collected did not include any of this work. My guess
is that the editors preferred the more New York-ish, experimental early
work. I thought those devotional (religious) poems were wonderful, very
moving (written, I think, when he knew he was dying) and was looking forward
to reading them on the page. Once again, however well-intentioned and
loving, one can see the distorting (sometimes censoring) effects of the
editorial process.

Ciao,

and if you are lucky enough to land in that situation, make very sure that the phrase "work for hire" appears nowhere in the contract.

(Three interrelated texts related to memory, billowing, inert)


1. Four Dead in O-hi-o

Several bars of the 1970 song about the Kent State student massacre came
on the radio; I began crying. First, there was the trauma of reliving the
event, already at a distance when it happened; second, there was the
energy and fulcrum of an entire era displayed; third, there was mourning
for aging - May '68 is almost forty years ago; fourth, there's the
imminence of all of this, as if it's happening now, here; sixth, there's
the incontrovertible bar, obdurate time-gap which portends a masquerade of
space; seventh, there's the realization that the bar is sublime if any-
thing is, and in fact the sublime lies within the temporal, not the
spatial, not with due or undue measurement; eighth, there's the integra-
tion of time's granularity with temporal distance; ninth, there's the
issue of internal time-consciousness and its presencing which is always a
form of mourning imminence; tenth, there's the billowing of time which
plays out psychologically in spatial dimensions; eleventh, it's as if one
might say, Oh, if only I could reach out, I would touch Four Dead in
O-hi-o, I would touch the song, the fury, the energy, the habitus, the
communality, the immanence of the burgeoning eco-political, the momentary
lapse in pessimism as against the most pessimistic of wars and bombs one
might consider the flower at the end of a barrel of a gun; twelfth, it's
the ringing of death itself or rather the horizon of death which lies in
any temporal horizon whatsoever as worlds are always already irretriev-
able; thirteenth, it's thinking through the playing out of these irre-
trievable worlds within the organization and granularity of the billowing
of the habitus, as if mourning consisted in watching the world of someone
one loves withering away; fourteenth, it's the recognition that such
withering is the foundation of the cosmos, Bell's theorem notwithstand-
ing; fifteenth, one only has to look at one's own withering, our cat for
example growing thinner by the way, her rounded and more robust form a
memory reconstituted either through video or photography, or, more likely,
through thinking through billowing, through the pleasure embedding all her
gestures in an indefinite and infinite world of spring and summer, which
was inescapably vectored towards this present and beyond, towards her
death which we pray is not immediate, not soon; sixteenth, recognizing
that billowing is a form of comfort, even among starvation, extinction,
torture, a form of comfort within which the smallest things are absorbed
and the temporal sublime appears as if in translation towards the glory of
an inconceivable Absolute; seventeenth, coming to the realization that the
comfort of the world is all the comfort there is, and the awkwardness and
pain of the world, our awkwardness and pain, is all there is as well;
eighteenth, it's as if Four Dead in O-hi-o never happened, it's as if that
energy were stillborn, our memories playing tricks, an accumulation of
subterfuges; nineteenth, yes we are living that impossible dream, impossi-
ble because of the stretch entailed as if implication were the fundamental
operation of the propositional logic; and twentieth, the gestural logics
of the breakdown of distributive laws - it's as if they're holding out
some sort of promise, but then the refrain of the song comes back, there
are bodies lying there, equally stillborn, there is the image of the
student looking up, towards the camera, someone dead and present, present
in the way our own deaths are present even in the most fundamental acts of
speaking, thinking, writing, this.

This is an attempt at a ruse, isn't it?
There isn't really a poet named Ceravolo, is there?
Cera is Spanish for wax.
And volo is kind of Italian/Spanish for I fly.
So we have a reference to Icarus,
a poet figure.

I've set up 3 different wikis over the years, where everything is
editable.  What's interesting to me is that since a history of every
edit/version is kept, people (other than hackers) are generally
thoughtful/respectful of people's work.

Patrick Masterson's and Paul Stephens' collaborative essay 'Spring in this
World of Mad Angels: The Poetry of Joe Ceravolo' is included in a book I
edited entitled Don't Ever Get Famous [Dalkey Archives, 2006], and provides
readers with an overview of Ceravolo's writing (including Fits of Dawn and
his devotional poetry published in INRI and Millennium Dust). I'm certainly
curious to hear what people think of their take on Ceravolo's work.

Perhaps if you were James Merrill but alive and hired good enough lawyers
and determined to sue someone with money enough to make a defense
worthy enough to get it appealed high enough up the appeals process in the=

right appeals courts to make a difference to the way the laws are interpre=
ted in
other jurisdictions, you might be able to help create an interpretation of=

damages to mean something other or more than merely financial damages. It
would be long hard and expensive, though, and still might not work.

The copyright law, and its revisions (which I happen to have worked on as =
an
aide to one of the US Senators on the Judiciary Committee in those years,
with the man who subsequently became Registrar, though I am not a lawyer)
still focuses on the money because it is, after all, still the law, and no=
t a work
of ethics.

So generally speaking, yes, you have to show you were harmed, and harmed
usually means, in the civil law, that there was damage that can be calcula=
ted
in money terms. Even if your reputation is damaged, you have to claim that=
 it
cost you money, because the law is, generally speaking, an ass. It is base=
d on
notions of property and money, and its goal is to balance property and mon=
ey
claims. The famous question by the man who was acquitted of all accusation=
s
is instructive here: "Where do I go to get my reputation back?" Nowhere, o=
f
course. The law does not deal with that.

In a gift economy it's all about reputation, isn't it? The goal of submitt=
ing and
publishing poetry is to create a reputation by writing good poems and gett=
ing
them out there for others to read. Even the folks who start out rich, or w=
ho are
well-off from non-poetry work, are not in the poetry thing for the money, =
and
recognize that they can't sue their ways to the top. We all know that Wilb=
ur,
Fenton, and Collins, for example, got lucky with money in poetry, and then=

worked hard and and smart and stayed lucky. But even you guys out there in=

the postmodernist magical thinking world, even you have to realize that ma=
ybe
it happens once every, what, 20 or 30 years? So what are the odds it's goi=
ng
to be YOU, yeah, you, you personally? Not good, even with that postmodern
magical thinking working for you, eh?

So no one sues anyone in the poetry world. No one even sued when Jorie
Graham and Bin Ramke awarded Peter Sacks top prize in a contest he didn't
enter, unless you count marrying Jorie Graham as entering the contest --
which is a little much even for metaphor, come to think of it.=A0 If there=
 were
going to be a suit in the poetry world, there's a fact pattern that a lawy=
er could
love. Except, instead of suing, almost everyone yawned and said yeah, that=
's
the way it happens, so what. The people whose contest entries weren't even=

read didn't bother to sue, though they'd paid their entry fee. It's just n=
ot
enough money. The damages are the entry fee and maybe the cost of the firs=
t
prize. But even if you count all the costs of publishing a book of poetry =
by a
university press, what can it be, $10,000?, it's still not enough money to=
 get an
attorney good enough to win the suit interested in suing. So no one sued.

Jorie Graham may never be asked to be a contest judge again. Peter Sacks
may be embarrassed to put that contest win on his CV. Bin Ramke is now
retired -- not even in the game any more -- but that's all a matter of rep=
utation,
isn't it, not money damage. Not even the people who are in the best possib=
le
position to sue in the poetry world sue other people in the poetry world.
There's just not enough money to justify it, and at the end, even if they =
win,
what do they have? They have a piddly amount of money, and the reputation
that they sue people over piddly amounts of money. If you ran a poetry con=
test
or a poetry journal or a poetry publishing company and Grebak "Sue 'em!"
Smith submitted a check and a MS, wouldn't you simply return both check an=
d
MS without comment? Of course you would. Who wants to risk dealing with
someone who's likely to cost you enormous amounts of time and energy and
money over something like poetry?

Similarly if the Grebak Journal sued poets for violating its simultaneous
submissions rule, who'd submit to it? Who wants to get involved with
someone likely to cost you enormous amounts of time, energy, and money
over something like poetry?

As for "really taking legal action", yes, you really have to sue to "reall=
y take
legal action" in a civil case. Sure, you can threaten to sue, but that's n=
ot
"really" taking "legal action" in any meaningful sense of the term. It's n=
ot "legal
action" until you pay the fee and file it with a court. Until then it's ju=
st
administrative remedies. That's not to say that a court isn't going to wan=
t to
see that you've exhausted your administrative remedies before suing, but t=
hat
doesn't make administrative remedies that a court is likely to require "re=
ally
legal action" any more than telling someone you'd like to make love with t=
hem
constitutes actual sex. It may be a precursor, but it ain't the real thing=
,
postmodern magical thinking, or no.

Consider this quote you quote in your email:

=A0"Then I got the parliamentary ombudsman to make an investigation and
he consulted the British Museum who confirmed that the book couldn=B4t be =
a
first edition. But when they were asked to say that publicly, they refused
to do so. The National Library of Scotland, a copyright library which
received editions of all my books, also refused to say anything. It is
extraordinary that something so clear could be deliberately ignored like
this. My position was really quite simple, I didn=B4t wish to take part in=
 a
fraud on the public. But at that time most poets either were published by
Fulcrum, or wished to be published by Fulcrum, so they seemed to consider
me a danger, and after six years I was completely isolated. Nobody spoke
to me anymore, and people were saying `it is not nice to fight=B4 and all
this kind of thing.
So, then, I went to the Consumer Protection Department which sent
the book to Sotheby=B4s whose expert on literary fraud, a man called Carte=
r,
said that it could not be a first edition, took the publisher to court,
and got the ruling that I was right. It then took the Arts Council Of
Great Britain a further two years to accept the court ruling and to
apologise to me. But I was never forgiven, I was always reminded that I
did something terrible. The fact that I was proven right counted for
nothing at all. What people remembered was that I had cause a lot of
trouble to these institutions by asking them to stand up and speak a
simple truth. But it was very instructive to me! This was when I first
realised what culture is."

If that's not a clear and concise record of what happens to people who go
outside the poetry business system and try to use the legal system, includ=
ing
Parlaiment, who prompt law suits by others among the other parties, and wh=
o
are ostracised for it, I don't kinow what is. You quote this remarkably de=
tailed
story yourself, and you still ask whether it would be a good idea to actua=
lly sue
someone? Extraordinary!

I ask Alison again, so what do you think you're doing talking about legali=
ty and
legal remedies in this poetry context? Let me quote this bit again:

"The fact that I was proven right counted for nothing at all. What people
remembered was that I had cause a lot of trouble to these institutions by
asking them to stand up and speak a simple truth."

Asking people to stand up and speak a simple truth against their economic
self-interest, against their reputational self-interest, against any kind =
of self-
interest, is deeply problematic. People won't do it without very unusual
circumstances, and even then they resent the hell out of it thereafter, an=
d do
all they can to get back, reputationally ("I was completely isolated. Nobo=
dy
spoke to me anymore, ... I was never forgiven, I was always reminded that =
I
did something terrible."), and they don't forget it.

It's bad advice to tell people in the poetry game to stand up for their le=
gal
rights and to declare that legal right is on this side or that because the=
 people
who make the decisions that enhance or diminish poetic reputations simply
won't tolerate it. They'll isolate anyone who sues them, and why shouldn't=

they? Lawsuits are expensive, time-consuming, and heart-breaking. These
are people who can't even be bothered to respond to inquiry letters and
submissions of poetry for months and months at a time, if at all. They're =
not in
it for the money, and if you use, or advise others to use, the legal remed=
ies
that may be theoretically available to them, it's career suicide within th=
e poetry
game. Don't do it.

Thanks, Dan. Interesting work from Marko, as always.

I found "Gotos" thought provoking. There's more there than meets the eye. We
see lines such as

220 GOTO 220
220 GOTO 140

We're under the impression that we're looking at the code, but the above
implies that the underlying code is different from what we're looking at;
clearly line 220 does not simply say either "GOTO 220" or "GOTO 140".

And if we look at the Javascript in gotos.html, we see that it's written to
generate, ad infinitum, a sequence of Goto statements. Marko has written a
program that presents an imaginary program that implies the existence of a
program to generate the imaginary program.

An interesting code idea.

ps: By the way, you mention Tish in connection with concrete, Dan. But, as
far as I know, Lionel Kearns was the only one from Tish who was involved in
concrete poetry. Tish was not particularly experimental, at least concerning
media, as far as I know.

pss: Concrete, to me, is grounded not so much in the visual as in
consciousness of media and the dimensionality of language and its
manifestations.

Ceravolo is a poet who matters a great deal to me for all the very
little i feel like I know about his work. I remember I had a tremendous
sense of recognition when I first came across some of his poems a year
or so ago, like i'd found a kindred literary spirit i'd never known
about. Which felt a little weird since I was all of ten years old when
he passed on. In particular, his use of repetition struck me as so
similar to mine that I remember wondering if people who were better read
than me had taken it as direct influence. I just checked the Ceravolo
page at EPC, which is where I discovered him in the first place, if i
remember correctly, and there are only a couple of links and then a
collection of four posts from this list from Jordan Davis, Joel Lewis,
Ron Silliman, and Mark Wallace. Pennsound has a bunch of really charming
recordings, but still, not enough to really be satisfying, more like a
really robust appetizer than a full entree. Perhaps what's needed is a
growing clamor of critical appraisal? Perhaps if there was enough of a
steady tide of secondary literature, it would raise awareness of the
disappointing thinness of what's available in print. Maybe those of us
anxious for a collected works should commit to doing something to raise
that awareness, a conspiracy of poets and editors to get his poetry
talked about more and so hopefully increase general interest. It seems
like there could be a lot done to increase the secondary literature
available about Ceravolo's poetry on the web that might bear fruit.

Well, you know, when non-Euclidean geometry was finally recognized, it
involved, among other things, a simplification of our idea of a straight
line. We kept the notion that it's the shortest distance between two points,
but threw out the specifically Euclidean ideas that obscured whole other
geometries.

Not that we no longer know what the Euclidean notion of a straight line
involves.

So too, perhaps, with our notion of what a language is.

Hi Murat

I wasn't saying it was all roses, either. I guess it's about knowing the
context you're entering. It's awful when the machine disempowers you.

Your experience sounds quite a lot like an argument I had about my fiction
with a Penguin editor, which took about six months out of my life and was
deeply stressful. In that case, the difference was that I was the sole
author and had some recourse, although I was heavily pressured and it was
difficult. In the end, I didn't make the drastic changes demanded - which
were all about the "market" but which to me made no sense at all - and I got
a new editor for the next book. Of course, in that case I wanted to write a
commercial book, so ultimately my wishes and my publisher's desires
coincided. My first book of poems was published by Penguin, and that was a
traumatic experience I wouldn't want to repeat. And didn't, although I had
invitations to do so, and I went to a small press instead for my next
collection.

All best

Alison

Hey George, you don't have to explain. I'm from a little colony called
Australia, which might have had moral rights of its own once.

You  are a stickler for accuracy bu not when you quote me.
  I never asked whether it would be a good idea to sue.
  I only asked whether it were possible.
  A good talker, not such a good listener.

Marcus Bales <marcus@DESIGNERGLASS.COM> wrote:

Parlaiment, who prompt law suits by others among the other parties, and who
are ostracised for it, I don't kinow what is. You quote this remarkably detailed
story yourself, and you still ask whether it would be a good idea to actually sue
someone? Extraordinary!

I ask Alison again, so what do you think you're doing talking about legality and
legal remedies in this poetry context? Let me quote this bit again:

"The fact that I was proven right counted for nothing at all. What people
remembered was that I had cause a lot of trouble to these institutions by
asking them to stand up and speak a simple truth."

Asking people to stand up and speak a simple truth against their economic
self-interest, against their reputational self-interest, against any kind of self-
interest, is deeply problematic. People won't do it without very unusual
circumstances, and even then they resent the hell out of it thereafter, and do
all they can to get back, reputationally ("I was completely isolated. Nobody
spoke to me anymore, ... I was never forgiven, I was always reminded that I
did something terrible."), and they don't forget it.

It's bad advice to tell people in the poetry game to stand up for their legal
rights and to declare that legal right is on this side or that because the people
who make the decisions that enhance or diminish poetic reputations simply
won't tolerate it. They'll isolate anyone who sues them, and why shouldn't
they? Lawsuits are expensive, time-consuming, and heart-breaking. These
are people who can't even be bothered to respond to inquiry letters and
submissions of poetry for months and months at a time, if at all. They're not in
it for the money, and if you use, or advise others to use, the legal remedies
that may be theoretically available to them, it's career suicide within the poetry
game. Don't do it.

>legal remedies in this poetry context?

This is boring. But, since Marcus is so insistent, I can't help wondering
why he thinks that copyright does not pertain to poets, unlike every other
creative artist. Of course there is plenty of precedent. Poetry under the
law is not different than any other kind of writing.

Here's the Wikipedia definition on moral rights (you USians are a bit behind
us on that one). Moral rights quite clearly pertain to more than merely
financial considerations.  I am, as I said, bored with this conversation,
and only post this for clarity, for those who might be bamboozled by
Marcus's bizarre arguments.


*Moral rights* are rights <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rights> of creators
of copyrighted <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyright> works generally
recognized in civil
law<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_law_%28legal_system%29>jurisdictions
and first recognized in
France <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France> and
Germany<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany>,
before they were included in the Berne Convention for the Protection of
Literary and Artistic
Works<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berne_Convention_for_the_Protection_of_Literary_and_Artistic_Works>in
1928. While the United
States <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States> became a signatory to
the convention in 1988, it still does not completely recognize moral rights
as part of copyright law <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyright_law>, but
rather as part of other bodies of law, such as defamation or unfair
competition. Those jurisdictions that include moral rights in their
copyright statutes are called droit
d'auteur<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_copyright_law>states,
which literally means "right of the author".

Moral rights include the right of
attribution<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attribution_%28copyright%29>,
the right to have a work published
anonymously<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anonymity>or
pseudonymously <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudonym>, and the right to
the integrity of the work. The preserving the integrity of the work bars the
work from alteration, distortion or mutilation. Anything else that may
detract from the artist's relationship with the work even after it leaves
the artist's possession or ownership may bring these moral rights into play.
Moral rights are distinct from any economic
rights<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_rights>tied to copyright,
thus even if an artist has assigned his or her rights to
a work to a third party he or she still maintains the moral rights to the
work. Some jurisdictions allow for the
waiver<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waiver>of moral rights. In the
United States, the Visual
Artists Rights Act
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_Artists_Rights_Act>of 1990 (VARA)
recognizes moral rights, but only applies to works of visual
art <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_art>.

Marcus,

I am not quite clear what you are exactly arguing against, that in most
cases it is better to let the matter go?

On the other hand, factually, though rare, suing in the poetry world does
occur? For instance, the Bronk estate sued the publisher when the poet was
included in an anthology of gay poetry.

Someone of financial means, in your terms with "a reputation to protect,"
can bankrupt a small publisher if he or she wants to. Therefore, the legal
niceties are important if nothing else for self-protection against such an
attack.

I do not know if your strict distinction between "suing" and "threatening to
sue," that they are completely different, is completely valid. For instance,
the inclusion opf an Auden poem in an anthology has a payment of several
thousands dollars attached to it. If "suing" was a figment of the
imagination, and "threatening to sue" a complete irrelevancy, what would
prevent a publisher to include the Auden poem anyhow?

Obviously, there is a hierarchy of "worth" in the poetry world also, though
the numbers are small time in terms of the wider world. There is also no
doubt that most of us as poets, most of the time, function below the radar
level. This does not mean the laws do not exist, at least in their
preventive power. When I was preparing the Eda anthology of Turkish poetry,
I was under the strict rule not to include any poet where the permission to
publish was not given in writing.

ciao,

Murat

Jim,

Thank you for your comments on Marko's work--often more than meets the
eye with his work.

My intention was no to connect Tish or the other schools/movements
with concrete. Quite the contrary, in fact. I was trying to say that
concrete, while it was in fact for a period of time a school/movement,
doesn't properly belong to that class of objects. It's not a
school/movement like Tish or Black Mountain is. It is a tool to be
used, a way of approaching certain challenges. Approaching them, as
you say, with a "consciousness of media and the dimensionality of
language and its manifestations." This is a working definition that is
in-line with my own.

Regards,
Dan

Subject:      On the reading in NYC Thursday August 2nd
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=iso-8859-1
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

To further elaborate, on Thurs. 8/2 at ACA Galleries, In NYC, 6:00 p.m.

Pavement Saw Press from Columbus, Ohio not only will appear with four readers

but I, David Baratier, will introduce and tell stories about how I chose books by all of the readers such as Simon Perchik who will be the feature, a man who, with Paul Blackburn, created what is currently known as The Poetry Project.

  I read with him back in 2003, which was his last reading in NYC. I convinced him to evict himself from from his cave and substantially emote which is no small thing for this small press champion who has appeared in every press listed in Dustbooks _THE INTERNATIONAL GUIDE TO SMALL PRESSES AND PUBLISHERS_ last year. His previous reading in NYC was over 25 years ago in the early 1970's. Poets who have passed on, such as Charles Olson, William Bronk, Jackson MacLow,  Robert Creeley, David Ignatow, and many others as well as living poets such as James Tate, X. J. Kennedy, Naton Leslie, Donald Baker, Robert Peters and many a more star filled cast have had substantially positive things to say about him. The collection I published, _Hands Collected: The Books of Simon Perchik Poems 1949-1999, which placed his first 17 collections back in print, was nominated for the National Book Award and has went through two editions. His next collection _The Family of Man_, another massive 550
 plus page book, will appear from Pavement Saw Press in 2008. I do hope you take the time to come and see this rare event.

  A poet in NYC, Tony Gloeggler's first full length book was published by Pavement Saw Press. He is an underdog, a narrative poet who has been important enough to escape attention but go into a second edition on the strength of  the word of mouth created by this narrative collection. I would like to say that many accolades brought him to this point but no, only the strength of his poems, and course adoptions, brought him to a second edition of 1000. He has two other chaps out, one won the Pearl poetry prize.

Rachel M. Simon's first book _Theory of Orange_ rankled many and recieved negative notice as a "poet of the moment" from POETRY Magazine while receiving highest accolades from Publishers Weekly. Go Figure. This intriguing first collection is well worth the time, if it matters even Dean Young puts it in the top of his list for 2007. Check it out.

  Daniel Zimmerman's collection _Post Avant_ changed poetry. Even the idea of "Post Avant" stems from this collection which is perhaps why it has become such a staple in the realm of American poetry. With a solid backing, and forward, by Bob Creeley, this is a collection of note that has done well, again, by word of mouth. Preceeded by a collaboration with one of the most important critics of the later 20th century, John (Jack) Clarke, which was then followed by some brilliant process work from various presses and has solidified his improtance. This is his first book after 30+ years in the field.

  So yes, I will introduce them all and tell a bunch of jokes in the process. Probably a bunch of the rumors that have been handed me, it is tough to say. Boy I love jokes. And fabrications for that matter. In the past, personal experience with Brad Gooch, Ann Coulter and Sean Hannity has made the bill but who knows. If you have more poetic threads for me to consider, please backchannel, I would really hate to repeat material.


Be well

I really wish sometimes that the folks in the modern linguistics field
would pay attention to the work that Frege and Russell did on formal
mathematical systems and their subsequent failures to work as an
idealized foundation for natural language as pointed out by Wittgenstein
repeatedly in Philosophical Investigations.

The work of mathematics will never be complete until mathematicians give
up the notion of a perfect formal system and formal realism. The work of
linguists will never be complete until they give up chomsky and stop
looking for the mythical universal grammar.

not that that relates to anything, just i think it's much more
productive to look at the real world than to build models of the world
and look at those as if they were the real world. why would anyone be
surprised when a model failed to account for something? that's the
nature of models.

I'm confused now. The moral rights lined out below offer the same
protections as copyright does. Moreover, US copyright law as it's
currently being jury rigged is on track to be a nightmare of
intellectual property protections for anyone thinking to violate the
rights of copyright holders. At this point, I'm not even sure i
understand why copyright has an expiration date in this country, because
everytime a bunch of work looks like it will be entering the public
domain, congress just extends the lifespan of copyright.

Joe Cerevolo is in every way a master poet

  check out the material available though Spuyten Duvil if you want a written record of it

  If it makes you feel more important even HR still talks of him. If you want to dispute what his wife has done and made available you are an unlikeable fuckhead.

  Go to the main site. Since the rest who would ask you have disappeared, What are you talking about? Absent? yeah right.

Masako's Story; Surviving the Atomic Bombing of Hiroshima
by Kikuko Otake
Ahadada Books, 96 pages,
perfect bound paperback, $15.00
ISBN 978-0-9781414-6-2
Soon to be available from SPD, but contact me back-channel if interested
in ordering, and/or in contacting the author.  More information:
www.ahadadabooks.com

On August 6, 1945, when the world's first atomic bomb was dropped on
Hiroshima, the Furuta family was living one mile away from the
hypocenter.  Five year old Kikuko, her mother, Masako, and her two
brothers barely escaped with their lives.  However, their soldier father
was not so fortunate.  Masako never talked about her family's
experiences on that day and the grim days following the bombing.  Then
one day, Masako started to talk about what happened--breaking a silence
of nearly fifty years.

Written by Kikuko (Furuta) Otake, now an assistant professor of Japanese
in the United States, Masako's story is a bilingual collection of
prose-poetry, based on the true story of her family's tragedy.  The
appendix presents the original Japanese poetry written to capture the
story as her mother said it in Hiroshima dialect.  Moreover, the English
translation is written with an "Objectivist" lineation similar in its
understated power to Charles Reznikoff's "Testimony":

After crossing the Aoi Bridge,
I walked diagonally across the grounds of the Gokoku Shrine
To take a short cut.
Oh.  That ground was filled with hundreds of people with horrible burns
Scattered everywhere.
Many of them were dead.
But those that still lived,
Begged, "Mizu! Mizu o kudasai," in faint whispers.
Soon my way was blocked by their outstretched arms.
One of them even grabbed my ankle, though feebly,
To stop me from running past him.
His burnt skin sloughed off his fingers,
As I pulled from his grip.

Kikuko Otake's Masako's Story is a powerful addition to the literature
of the Atomic Bomb, and yet more evidence that we should all work
together to stop the Nuclear madness.

Dedication

You whom I could not save
Listen to me.
Try to understand this simple speech as I would be ashamed of another.
I swear, there is in me no wizardry of words.
I speak to you with silence like a cloud or a tree.

What strengthened me, for you was lethal.
You mixed up farewell to an epoch with the beginning of a new one,
Inspiration of hatred with lyrical beauty,
Blind force with accomplished shape.

Here is the valley of shallow Polish rivers. And an immense bridge
Going into white fog. Here is a broken city,
And the wind throws the screams of gulls on your grave
When I am talking with you.

What is poetry which does not save
Nations or people?
A connivance with official lies,
A song of drunkards whose throats will be cut in a moment,
Readings for sophomore girls.
That I wanted good poetry without knowing it,
That I discovered, late, its salutary aim,
In this and only this I find salvation.

They used to pour millet on graves or poppy seeds
To feed the dead who would come disguised as birds.
I put this book here for you, who once lived
So that you should visit us no more.

--Czeslaw Milosz, Warsaw, 1945

That it's possible is self-evident -- why ask such a thing? The important
question is not whether you can but whether you should. Just because
someone has a right to do something doesn't make it the right thing to do.

Copyright pertains to poets. I'm asking why you think that poets ought to be
suing journals, and journals poets, over the disputes they have about things
such as editing poems in journals or submitting them simultaneously? What's
the point of urging poets to stand up on their legal rights when that is such an
obviously bad idea in a gift economy where the first time you sue to enforce
your legal rights will probably mean that that's the last poem you ever get
published once word gets around that you're willing to sue journals over such
trivia?

> Of course there is plenty of precedent. Poetry under the

You're in the unenviable position of arguing that people should take de
minimus issues to court. Would you also urge husbands and wives to sue one
another over whether they got sex, or dinner was on time, or no agreement to
go over to the in-laws on Saturday, or the like while the couple still wants to
remain married?

The law has no business, and, thank god, no interest, in settling disputes
between husbands and wives over who got sex or didn't, nor in settling
disputes between poets and editors over who got published or didn't, or who
changed a poem or didn't. It may become an issue if money comes into it,
such as in divorce proceedings or if the poet becomes famous and the poem
is actually worth money to print or re-print, but only then.

Shouting about one's legal rights in a gift economy is a recipe for career
disaster, so I hope no one takes Alison's advice about it. But I'd recommend
Jason's advice not to sign any contracts that contain the words "work for hire"
in them, if you're lucky enough to be offered a contract to write something.

Erm, what are you doing in these dumpsters, David? I take it they've got
home-oriented construction/removal stuff in them, and you're doing
"rubBEings, intermedia and clay impression spray paintings", but I'm not
sure what sort of work that is.

When I visited Dallas, we did a media art gig (on nuclear annihilation) in a
concrete cave. In the bowels of what used to be a big concrete warehouse.
The space was cavernous, dark, and with extrorinarily high ceilings. Some of
the walls had been destroyed with sledgehammers, and the destroyed parts
opened into a yet deeper, near bottomless pit that almost conversed with you
when you spoke into it, so pronounced were the echoes. Visiting Dallas, I'd
expected to meet Nick, but I hadn't expected to end up in the pit. There was
enough concrete dust to kill a tubercular novelist. The textures of the
destroyed portions of the wall reminded me of a cave. It was like a
post-apocalyptic bunker. In any case, it was just so concrete. So urban. So
empty. So evocative, nonetheless. The urban cave is concrete. Harkening not
to a prehistoric past but a post-apocalyptic future.

It's interesting that 'concrete' is often used as the 'opposite' of
'abstract'. As though there could be nothing less abstract than concrete.
All abstraction has been limed away (the reverse of the subliming process
you speak of?). The utter base reality. Utter. Totally without the slightest
hint of even the dimmest glimmer of mentality. The weight of the physical
world. But wait. Concrete dumb and the true exemplar of the insensate
fundament? It is made by people, subject to various chemical processes.
Perhaps, then, concrete as 'foundational'. Concrete is one of the
fundamental building materials and the foundations of buildings are often
made of concrete. The concrete mind, the mind of the child. That is thought
to deal in particulars, not so much in abstraction. Or at least the
materials in which it deals are more fundamental. The materials. The
fundamentals. The fundament.

I don't know why I'm saying this. I have never, at any time, suggested that
anyone sue anybody. Having been sued myself, I have rather stern views about
writers suing people. This is an entirely different issue from knowing one's
rights under the law. A distinction that Marcus seems to have trouble with,
(but then, he has rather peculiar ideas about how the legal system actually
works - I wonder what real world he lives in?); but I hope nobody else does.

And, I promise, no matter what the provocation, I will try to stay schtumm
now.

All best

Note: I apologize my letters come out so jammed, so concretely packed as it=
 were--hotmail changed and on some lists they come out fine and some not.  =
Maybe i should try subscribing via different mail server.Dear Jim:Many than=
ks for your letter and thought provoking ideas and questions---     Concret=
e of course is foundational--and one of the interesting things about that i=
s how easily and relatively quickly concrete actually cracks, disintegrates=
, wears down for a "foundational" material.   Think of potholes, leaky base=
ments, cracked and fragmenting sidewalks . . . one of the pleasures of the =
concrete in the world for me is always just just this--the very cracking, f=
alling apart, imminent collapse, urban decay, all those crumbling concrete =
buildings of the former Soviet Bloc, American Projects, Italian Fascist hou=
sing and train stations--concrete structures the world over which are rapid=
ly becoming the ruins of failed Utopias which seem dimmer today than vision=
s of Atlantis to the hundreds of millions living in --or in the shadows of-=
-their tottering structures and proliferating dusts and debris.    If you t=
hink about it, the closest thing to an actual physical concrete as foundati=
onal is the Roman concrete--after all--their roads, bridges, aqueducts, col=
iseums, theaters--there are a very great many still in  use  today and it  =
seems that footage of disasters in Europe is always showing how the new "in=
destructible" materials have been destroyed, while the Roman structures rem=
ain standing and functioning.  Not only that--as we write here now you and =
i, we are using the Roman alphabet, whether we make concrete poems or pure =
unadulterated gibberish or statements of fact drawn from Sabermetrics regar=
ding Tony Gwynn's career on base percentage (OBP) after the seventh inning =
in night games in San Diego (home) and  away.      The place you describe i=
n Dallas--i have lived in a number of in various versions--in the usa and i=
n paris--and in Boston there were a couple such places that were strictly "=
shooting galleries"--heroin addicts only- the foundation walls alone were c=
oncrete--masses of cracks--leakge and botchy stains on the grey--it was dam=
p so the dust stayed pretty much on the floor--there were the corpses of ma=
ttresses scattered about with  living dead humans lying on them--and theonl=
y water to use for the shooting up was from rusty piepes--the sort of place=
 where it is the eternal now--dictated by the heoin-run metabolism--no past=
, no future--no caves--no apocalypse--no "post" anything--and no "past--we =
used to call it the "non-zone" a friend and i--aka the "nod-zone"--and the =
spectral shoddy rusting remnants of a former Piranesian interior registered=
 as neither interesting or uninteresting on the "non-scale" of "non-emotion=
s"--It is only later, as Burroughs notes also--that one is able to descibe =
or analyze any of these thousands of "non-experiences" as actual happenings=
 with materials of interest and use in making things out of the "non-ness".=
  To bring back from the world of the living-dead.        (Some of my publi=
shed stories have a few places similar toi these in them and working on a s=
eries whcih all take place in and around one massive interior such as you d=
escribe--except not cave-like--being in Boston--more like a collapsed and c=
aving in interior of the old Constitution (is that the right name)--the old=
 battleship in Boston Harbour--imagine that ruined in a battle--and blown u=
p a few stories high--and in winter!!!--)     The physical sense of concret=
e--as opposed to abstraction--is very true--yet what is strange about much =
lnguage in concrete poetry and of course the so -called "material" word in =
Language poetry--is that they quickly become quite abstract--they begin to =
refer more and more to an idea of a pure language than to the foundation of=
 the dirt and blood and junk of human and other existences among things. A =
concrete poem begins to refer only to itself and in doing so becomes not a =
foundation, but an epitome.  It becomes purer and purer and its functions m=
ore and more abstractly functional.  That it is, it becomes a demonstration=
-machine (WCW's "a poem is a machine made of words"--often now of one word)=
--of ways the functions of a letter, word, a bit of grammer or syntax, can =
be "played" with/on.    This isn't so much "foundational " as 'elemental" n=
 the sense of partilces, elements, which go into the creation of a structur=
e, a composition.  "It is not the elements which are new, but the order of =
their arrangement" says Pascal.  To me, concrete poetry is actually much mo=
re related to some aspects of abstract art and also to the early days of th=
e use of tape recorders in the creation of sound poetry.  (Henri Chopin and=
 Bob Cobbing among many others have written some veryeloquent essays on thi=
s period of development in the machine-use of the human voice in a "concret=
e" manner which at the same time is abstract--that is, abstracted from the =
actual voice and, as an element in recorded time on seperate tapes, can be =
remixed and so like Pascal's elements "arranged" in new orders of astonishi=
ng range and effect.  The mult-or Intermedia (Dick Higgins) aspects of conc=
rete are in this abstraction into elements--the elements in the differing m=
edia--sound, film, video, sculpture, words, etc-- broken down to their elem=
ents in terms of the most basic--letters for example as in Lettrisme--and i=
nto basic elements of syntax, grammer--the sound/visual and space/time elem=
ental components.     But is this in itself "foundational"?  It depends on =
one's sense of where the foundations are--if they end here--then they are. =
 Yet if they do not--tthey then extend into the "actual concrete" of the ph=
ysically existing environment.  Bob Cobbing, who began in the 1940's with v=
isual scores which used no lexical signs--worked through the sense of score=
s in concrete sound poetry and arrived at the voice only expressing whateve=
r literally "came to hand".   To me this is the extension of the concrete t=
o the "foundational" of human voice and of as Chung Tzu puts it "Look under=
 your feet!"--that is, the foundation of what one literally is standing on.=
                That is how I came  quite some long time ago to find the wa=
y of working with found materials from the streets and then even more direc=
tly on/with found materials in the streets.  RubBeings and the clay impress=
ion spray paitings and many other equally simple techniques and media--abou=
t at the level of a five year old child--my youngest son is five and easily=
 i would say ahead of me--in so many ways--with these one works directly in=
 contact and with collaboration with the materials themselves--about as 'co=
ncrete' as one can get.  In this work what one is often really detailing, a=
s Cocteau said of the cinema, is "death at work"--decay, deComposition, the=
 falling apart of the foundational as it becomes something other--and parad=
oxically is simulateneously a foundational elment in one's work--there is w=
hat i call  an "anarkeyological" energy at the core of this chnage which is=
 the basis of art according to Basho--the anarchical shiftings and deCompos=
tions and layerings and collapses of strata--"the most beaitufl world is a =
heap of rubble tossed down in confusion (or: at random, depending on the tr=
ansaltion)--Heraclitus.        I have to leave this moment unfortunately or=
 wd try to add a few thoughts--to see some examples of my work and that of =
many others working in all sorts of media--my blogspot ishttp://davidbaptis=

tries--one is re contemporary collage and historcial examples--and the othe=

You quoted the sentence that ends "while the couple still wants to remain
married" -- did you fail to read the final clause? Did you fail to read the
acknowledgment immediately following about divorce?

Of course people go to law about divorce -- because there are money issues
over which they disagree and cannot resolve their differences without
recourse to the law. The question I'm asking, that I explicitly asked Alison, and
now that I ask you, is whether you advocate that the law should be invited into,
as a matter of course, such issues as when a married couple that wants to
stay married has sex, or where they go to dinner, or whether they go to his or
her inlaws over the holidays? Do you advocate that the law should be the
ordinary recourse between poets and editors over whether a poem is good or
bad, or is well- or ill-edited? Are you, really?

The below message is a request for info from Ron Padgett.  Please backchannel your suggestions so that I can forward them all in one email to him.

And thank you for any help on the matter!


The publisher of Joe Brainard's forthcoming THE NANCY BOOK (a collection of his Nancy images, as well as his Nancy writings, with an introduction by Ann Lauterbach) has asked me for the following info, and I'm relaying the question to you, since you know 100 times more about it than I do:

 Names/contact info for various blogs, listservs and sites that have had an interest in or featured Joe's work in particular, New York School work in general, etc. Also, names of on-line literary and art reviews, individual bloggers, etc. who you know and you think would be excited about the book so that they can link to Siglio and/or talk about the book.

 Can you get back to me within the next few days?

 Thanks.

 Ron

Subject:      time-lapse of hanging a show
Comments: To: announce <announce@logolalia.com>
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

Last Thursday night (July 5th) we hung the show "Guns In Loving
Memory" at Test Pattern in Scranton, Pennsylvania (USA). During the
hanging I set up a camera to take a picture every 30 seconds. All went
mostly as planned, except it stopped shooting about a half an hour
before we were really finished. My fault, I let the batteries run out,
though, in my defense, the hanging did take a bit longer than
originally planned (150 pieces is a lotta nails to measure placement
for), and by the time we were done my top mental priority wasn't on
power to the camera.

If you'd like to watch a time-lapse sequence of images that covers
almost the entire hanging of the show, you're invited to view it via a
pair of options at:

http://www.logolalia.com/time-lapse.html

This record of the event would not have happened at all were it not
for the hugely generous help and loan of equipment from my friend and
roommate Dave.

There will also be a 360 degree panorama image of the entire gallery
after the hanging was complete, he's working on stitching those images
together even as you read this.

Thanks also to Conor, Andrea, Jennifer, Helen, and David for all their
help in making the event come off without a hitch. And, of course,
thanks to Test Pattern hosting the event in fine fashion.

Regards,
Dan

I am a sick man. I am a vile man. I think about death too much. I harbor

That's insufficient. That's never enough. Death is the refutation of all.
Death terminates infinitude. Here is death's nonexistent refutation of the

That can't count enough. That's never enough. Death devours data-base and

Death's dreaming which is never enough. Death motivates me. I succumb to

Death muddles me. Death confuses me. Death take me. Death hold me. Here is

It's too confusing. Death rushes me, annihilates me. I will death's
annihilation. Yet does death listen. Nor does death listen. Here is a
nonexistent configuration of death's silence:

It's too noisy. Death crushes me, lacerates me. Death has no bell, no drum, no
whistle. Death writes this. Here is a nonexistent file of death's grip, death's
claw, death's blood, death's bone, my grip, my claw, my blood, my bone:

Raises hand!  Feel free to put me down as one of the Joeophiles.  I love his
poetry as much as I do his art in other media, and am happy to see  Mr.
Padgett is continuing the work of a friendship which he already has  tended so
beautifully with his recent book on Joe! It reminds me of my aunt in  California
using baby oil to clean her sister's grave. That sort of thing always  moves me
tremendously. My blog is _http://joebrainardspyjamas.blogspot.com/_
(http://joebrainardspyjamas.blogspot.com/) .   And I'm psyched about the Nancy book A.L.
is curatin'. Finally, more Joe!   Why it's like "seven minutes with Woody
Woodpecker, seven minutes of pure  bliss!" "Abusing Nietzsche, they descend in
their Joe Brainard  pyjamas..."

Hi, we've re-done our UbuRadio stream using ShoutCast. UbuRadio streams =
audio selected from the archives of UbuWeb. Currently we're streaming a =
few thousands selections and we'll add more soon. You can listen to Ubu =
24/7 on your favorite media player. We had previously tried with QuickTime =
rather than ShoutCast, but had numerous problems. We think this version =
will be much more successful.

Please give it a listen. I'm sending this announcement to a limited group =
to test it out before we annouce more widely. Apologies for any cross-posti=
ng!

While there may be some re-buffering due to net traffic and/or connection, =
please let me know if it seems excessive. Send any other comments as well. =
Thanks!

Some Notes on Language


"The answer is this: war on totality, Let us attest to the unpresentable;
let us activate the differends and save the honor of the name." (Jean-
Francois Lyotard, The Postmodern Explained.)

Watching early silent Shakespearian films on Turner Classic Movies - the
linguistic register transforms into (visual) protolanguage; protolanguage
can literally trace the visible. the earlier films (1899 - maybe 1908)
tend towards special effects constructed as if for the first time; pre-
sence is transformed and protolanguage gives way to wonder.

Agehananda Bharati writes on 'intentional language' in The Tantric Tradi-
tion - this is considered a mistranslation of samdha-bhasa by Alex Wayman
in The Buddhist Tantras: Light on Indo-Tibetan Esotericism; he translates
the same as 'twilight language' as the 'climactics' between darkness and
light. The ambiguity that arises is described by Nagarjuna in his Samdhi-
bhasa-jika who gives such examples as "is the ambrosia (amrta) of heaven,
to be drunk continuously." "is wind, is food, to be controlled." "One
should be convinced, 'these very bones of mine are my ornaments.'" "is
inhalation; and one should stop it from its violent acts." "has avikalpa
nature; also, while the wind is being inhaled there is no recitation."

Wayman states "The twilights symbolized the sensitive points in the
temporal flow when spiritual victory was possible. A special vocabulary
was created to refer to these critical points and called in the Buddhist
Tantras 'twilight language.'" "Nagarjuna's commentary suggests that the
Hevajratantra has given the basic list of 'twilight language.' These are
expressions for ambiguous yoga states, while 'non-twilight language'
refers to states of yoga that are not ambiguous." In English, the phrases
themselves are ambiguous and it's not clear whether the ambiguity
parallels or is equivalent to the ambiguity in the original. It's not
clear where the original lies. The ambiguity in English refuses to resolve
and it is this refusal that constructs an alliance with the inert. The
inert collapses whereas 'intentional language' retains mind. The collapse
is the mirror of the protolanguage of early Shakespearian silent film.

Nagarjuna, in his Letter to King Gautamiputra ("The Letter of a Friend")
states (in relation to the suffering of gods re: samsara):

"Their bodies' complexion becomes ugly, they do not like to sit, their
garlands of flowers wither, their clothes become soiled, and sweat appears
on their bodies - (all of which) never happened before. Just as on earth
the signs of dying foretell man's approaching death, so these five former
signs presage the death and transmigration of the gods dwelling in
heaven."

The summarization of the commentaries states:

"As the signs of death come to human beings, so do they come to gods. When
the time comes for a god to die, these five signs appear.
(1) Though they are usually very beautiful, they lose their great beauty
and become very ugly.
(2) Though they are ordinarily never bored because of their many pleas-
ures, they become bored and do not know what to do. [...]"

(Venerable Lozang Jamspal, Venerable Ngawang Samten Chophel, Peter Della
Santina, translating/editing; the original commentaries by Jetsun Rendawa
Shonnu Lodo, the Venerable Lozang Jinpa and the Venerable Rongton Sheja
Kunrig.)

Gods are bored, besides themselves. They're wandering, useless, used up,
non-intended, not having paid sufficient attention to religious matter.
One might say they're neither here nor there, they drain twilight language
of the climactic. I'd say they're speechless, that their speech is of no
consequence, that they inhabit the silence of the silent film. If speech
participates in representation, digital division between that=which-is and
that-which=is-not, then the gods move into the analogic inert, just as
language becomes nothing whatsoever, and the climactic transforms into
that global warming annihilating all life, reincarnation karma-dharma or
not. Doesn't rebirth require a certain temperature bandwidth, between the
frozen and the plasma? What's happening here? Nothing's happening.

Yesterday, I couldn't stop thinking about Dylan Thomas' poem, And Death
Shall Have No Dominion. I probably wouldn't have noticed Alan Sondheim's
beautiful poem posted last night, had I not noticed all the prompt replies
to the question regarding his quote from Dostoevsky's Notes from
Underground.

Thinking of the Thomas poem yesterday, although I've memorized most of it, I
realized I had forgotten one of the verses, so I listened to it online
today, here:

WITH MORE TINY BOOKS, POETRY FEEDS THE WORLD

Meritage Press (MP) is pleased to announce the second title in its series of=
 Tiny Books that aligns poetry with fair trade and economic development issu=
es affecting Third World countries.=20

MP's Tiny Books initially utilize small books (1 3/4" x 1 3/4") made in Guat=
emala by artisans paid fair wages, as sourced by Baksheesh, a fair trade ret=
ailer. All profits from book sales then will be donated to Heifer Internatio=
nal, an organization devoted to reducing world hunger by promoting sustainab=
le sources of food and income.=20

We are delighted to announce that MP's second Tiny Book is=20

Tom Beckett is the author of Unprotected Texts: Selected Poems 1978~2006 (Me=
ritage Press, 2006), and the curator of E-X-C-H-A-N-G-E-V-A-L-U-E-S: The Fir=
st XI Interviews (Otoliths, 2007). From 1980-1990, he was the editor/publish=
er of the now legendary critical journal, The Difficulties. Steps: A Noteboo=
k is Tom Beckett's first hay(na)ku poetry collection. The hay(na)ku is also=20=
a form that lends itself to minimalism.=20

Dan Waber is a visual poet, concrete poet, sound poet, performance poet, pub=
lisher, editor, playwright and multimedia artist whose work has appeared in=20=
all sorts of delicious places, from digital to print, from stage to classroo=
m, from mailboxes to puppet theaters. He is currently working on "and everyw=
here in between". He makes his online home at logolalia.com. Meritage Press=20=
tapped Mr. Waber to inaugurate the series partly for his work in minimalist=20=
poetry.=20

With Tiny Books, MP also offers a new DIY, or Do-It-Yourself Model of publis=
hing. You've heard of POD or print-on-demand? Well, these books' print runs=20=
will be based on HOD or Handwritten-on-Demand. MP's publisher, Eileen Tabios=
, will handwrite all texts into the Tiny Books' pages and books will be rele=
ased to meet demand for as long as MP is able to source tiny books -- or unt=
il the publisher gets arthritis.=20

This project reflects Meritage Press' belief that "Poetry feeds the world" i=
n non-metaphorical ways. The Tiny Books create demand for fair trade workers=
' products while also sourcing donations for easing poverty in poorer areas=20=
of the world.=20

Each Tiny Book will cost $10 plus $1.00 shipping/handling. To purchase the T=

As of JUly 8, 2007, we have garnered enough book sales to donate funds suffi=
cient to give three-and-a-half flocks of chicks.=C2=A0 Nota bene re chickens=
:=20

"CHICKENS are a real value. Starting at six months, they can lay up to 200 e=
ggs a year =E2=80=94 a reliable source of protein for children who otherwise=
 subsist mostly on starches. Extra eggs can be sold to pay for school, cloth=
es and medicine. And in the vegetable garden, chickens peck at bugs and weed=
s, scratch up the soil and enrich it with droppings."

Isn't that interesting about chickens?!=C2=A0 But we're not that far from "t=
he most giving animal around": -- the goat!=C2=A0 Note bene re goats:

"GOATS: Did you know that more children around the world get their protein f=
rom goat's milk? That's because goats thrive in extreme climates where other=
 livestock can't, and eat grasses and leaves that cause other animals to tur=
n up their noses (or snouts)!=C2=A0 And if it's a Heifer goat, one strugglin=
g family can receive up to a gallon of milk from it every single day. That's=
 more than enough milk not only to drink, but to use to make cheese, butter=20=
or yogurt, plus to sell whatever's left and buy much-needed clothes, school=20=
supplies and medicine.=C2=A0 Although they appear tough and gruff, goats are=
 actually so gentle that it's usually the family's children who regularly ca=
re for them. In this way, goats really do become "nannies;" teaching their y=
oung caregivers all kinds of skills while building their self-esteem. This y=
ear, give the gift that keeps giving, over and over again. It's the best pre=
sent you could give to someone who gives so much to you."

For what it's worth, I knew him back in the day. But I never did understand
what makes "beat" & don't like the term myself.

But does anyone know how to reach Bill Bissett now? I'd like to be back in
touch. Please backchannel. Thanks.  Diane di Prima

bit of literary history...)


Six-toed Hemingway cats can stay, city says

KEY WEST, Florida (AP) -- City officials have sided with Ernest
Hemingway's former home and its celebrated six-toed felines in its
cat fight with the U.S. Department of Agriculture.

http://www.cnn.com/2007/US/07/09/hemingway.cats.ap/index.html

Patches, a descendant of Ernest Hemingway's six-toed cats, is on the
prowl in Key West, Florida.

The Key West City Commission exempted the home from a city law
prohibiting more than four domestic animals per household.

About 50 cats live there.

The house has been locked in a dispute with the USDA, which claims
the museum is an "exhibitor" of cats and needs a special license, a
claim the home disputes.

The new ordinance reads in part, "The cats reside on the property
just as the cats did in the time of Hemingway himself. They are not
on exhibition in the manner of circus animals. ... The City
Commission finds that family of polydactyl Hemingway cats are indeed
animals of historic, social and tourism significance."

It also states that the cats are "an integral part of the history and
ambiance of the Hemingway House."

A USDA spokesman did not return messages left late Sunday.

The cats are descendants of a six-toed cat given as a gift to the
writer in 1935. All carry the gene for six toes, though not all
display the trait.

This is an attempt at a ruse, isn't it?
There isn't really a poet named Ceravolo, is there?
Cera is Spanish for wax.
And volo is kind of Italian/Spanish for I fly.
So we have a reference to Icarus,
a poet figure.

Alan,

"Traces" not only the "visible," but also the "invisible."

That's what I have been trying to say for years, including in The Peripheral
Space of Photography. The wonder of a new language, which also implies the
death of the old.

What you call protolanguage (the inert) is also what is beyond words being
the only language ("that=which-is and
that-which=is-not"). No surprise, for the last year, I was trying to
understand your distinction between digital and analalogical.

Analogical is death, isn't it, death, at least, of a given system
(onelanguage game)
transcending to other media, to other senses (from ear to eye to non
eye/mind's eye, to eda).

When Dostoyesky is saying "I am a sick man, I am a spiteful man, my liver is
diseased," isn't he announcing the birth of a new system, based on a new
ethos (of failure, of death) which of course has withing it the death of the
old?

The refusal to escape this ambiguity, but rather  to embrace this distance,
is what true translation is.

The language of the inert = Melville (his "inert" narrative, "I would prefer
not to") = silence of the audible through seeing (silent movies) = seeing of
the invisible (Bresson, peripheral space) = a sound or movement of the mind
("heard melodies are sweet, but those unheard sweeter") = eda ("play on...).

Agehananda Bharati writes on 'intentional language' in The Tantric Tradi-
tion - this is considered a mistranslation of samdha-bhasa by Alex Wayman
in The Buddhist Tantras: Light on Indo-Tibetan Esotericism; he translates
the same as 'twilight language' as the 'climactics' between darkness and
light. The ambiguity that arises is described by Nagarjuna in his Samdhi-
bhasa-jika who gives such examples as "is the ambrosia (amrta) of heaven,
to be drunk continuously." "is wind, is food, to be controlled." "One
should be convinced, 'these very bones of mine are my ornaments.'" "is
inhalation; and one should stop it from its violent acts." "has avikalpa
nature; also, while the wind is being inhaled there is no recitation."

========================>

What the west calls "twilight language", has been mispronounced as
"samdha-bhasa". It should be spelled "sandhyabhasa". Here is a wikipedia
link on
the Charyapadas (pronounced Char-Ja-paw-dough)
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charyapada

The facts on this page, as far as I can tell, are correct.

The word "sandhya" in Bengali, Hindi and/or most east Indian languages means
"evening", "bhasa" is language.

Thanks

I thought that if I could put it all down, that would be one way.  And next the thought came to me that to leave all out would be another, and truer, way.

Six-toed Hemingway cats can stay, city says

KEY WEST, Florida (AP) -- City officials have sided with Ernest
Hemingway's former home and its celebrated six-toed felines in its
cat fight with the U.S. Department of Agriculture.

http://www.cnn.com/2007/US/07/09/hemingway.cats.ap/index.html

Patches, a descendant of Ernest Hemingway's six-toed cats, is on the
prowl in Key West, Florida.

The Key West City Commission exempted the home from a city law
prohibiting more than four domestic animals per household.

About 50 cats live there.

The house has been locked in a dispute with the USDA, which claims
the museum is an "exhibitor" of cats and needs a special license, a
claim the home disputes.

The new ordinance reads in part, "The cats reside on the property
just as the cats did in the time of Hemingway himself. They are not
on exhibition in the manner of circus animals. ... The City
Commission finds that family of polydactyl Hemingway cats are indeed
animals of historic, social and tourism significance."

It also states that the cats are "an integral part of the history and
ambiance of the Hemingway House."

A USDA spokesman did not return messages left late Sunday.

The cats are descendants of a six-toed cat given as a gift to the
writer in 1935. All carry the gene for six toes, though not all
display the trait.

Subject:      some notes on intention and vaguery
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII; format=flowed

after sondheim

one of the problems with reading ludwig wittgenstein is that he very rarely makes explicit the targets of his investigations. this is bad enough in his early work, and it becomes almost insurmountable in his late period, to the point that one almost needs a knowledge of frege, russell, schopenauer, james, moore, and spengler, as well as a working knowledge of the ideas of the vienna circle to know what he is talking about a lot of the time.

this is not to say that what he is talking about is necessarily something not worth knowing, or that one SHOULD have to know about frege et al in order to understand the points he makes. Rather, this is one facet of the difficulty in reading wittgenstein that he wrote for a very small audience with the prior conviction that he probably couldn't make himself understood anyway, and with the further constraint that he didn't want to offer up anything that looked anything like a theory based on his belief that any such theory is doomed to be nonsensical.

the question that here arises then is what to make of wittgenstein's treatment of intention and vagueness in Philosophical Investigations and Zettel?

The answer is a relatively simple one that must be understood in terms of the movement that wittgenstein prophetically opposed in all of his later work, that is, the Chomskyan school of linguistics and their lynchpin theory of universal grammar.

Whether or not such a universal grammar hardwired into human brains wittgenstein would have held as a question for psychologists and neurologists, and not for linguists and philosophers. Rather, it is the duty of philosophers and linguists to look at the forms of life in which language arises and to see how language is used in those areas. His argument here is not specifically directed against anyone, although russell and his chrystaline formal grammars of logic and mathematics, as well as the scientific materialism of the vienna circale are both specifc targets that he no doubt intended to take aim at.

Rather, what the intention is here is to direct the attention of his reader via his interlocutor at the usefulness, and indeed, the necessity of vagueness for communication. It is vagueness that allows us to use color words, to use indexical expressions, and to shortcut around all manner of terms that if we necessitated rigorous and thorough definitions for, would be completely unworkable. his statement that "we have got on to slippery ice and are unable to walk. for that we need friction, back to the rough ground" is as succinct a statement as possible outlining the need for vagueness in language in order to allow it to communicate anything at all.

further, note that it is vague that the intent here is to challenge such polishers of language, those who would produce idealized, universal grammars, and beneath that, the intent to show how such endeavors are not just doomed to failure and worthless, but that they are actively detrimental to understanding.

There is a point at which the vagueness of a sentence must be accepted as an end and that we must stop polishing it for if we do not it will cease to mean what it vaguely means and begin to precisely mean something else entirely, if it is lucky enough to mean anything at all, which is highly unlikely.

more to the point, however, is the question of intent and how one intends. the idea of intent is a metaphysically garbled one and very difficult to speak about. wittgenstein instead directs us to think about situations in which we use the word. his suggestion is that those uses are what the word and the behavior means and there is an end to it.

House Press came together in Buffalo in 2002 as poets inside and outside th=
e
University of Buffalo started daily and nightly collaboration. That year,
they began a workshop at 149 Lisbon, a reading series at Spot Coffee, minte=
d
the first issue of the magazine Drill, and published their first book: a
four-man collab/collection. Since then, some members have scattered to
Chicago, Brooklyn, San Francisco, Albany, Charlottesville, and St. Louis,
while others have held down the fort. Drill has morphed into String of Smal=
l
Machines (S.F./Chicago), and two other magazines, Spell (Chicago) and Sourc=
e
Material (Brooklyn), have arisen. Meanwhile, House has published over two
dozen books and a half-dozen cds. In addition to poetry and music, they've
worked with prose, street art, book art, and film.

Jason,

Thank you for your acute analysis, without too much hagiography.

The key phrase to me in your passage is: "and with the further constraint
that he didn't want to offer up anything that looked anything like a theory
based on his belief that any such theory is doomed to be nonsensical."

Well, it is nonsensical, and he knows it to be so, since in his universe
metaphysics is nonsense. On the other hand, there is the question: "how can
I go on living without meaning, without killing myself?" Therefore, he has
to act as though there is meaning. I wish someone honestly faces this
dilemma in Wittgenstein's philosophy.

"Vagueness" feels so much like a loophole to me, if he did not feel
compelled to square this loophole.

Ciao,

Murat

Actually, the cats were *not* Ernest Hemingway's cats and are not
descendents of a pet owned by Hemingway. Hemingway raised peacocks as
pets at 907 Whitehead Street and the cats showed up much later. The cat myth
continues to help sell tickets to the house where the polydactyl cats
presently reside, and ticket sales help to maintain the house, so it is all
for the good. I found the cats to be fat and lazy and quite happy and most
of them were spayed or neutered.

guess i'm thinking 'bout the distinction allen makes between the horrible and
the miserable:

"I'm obsessed with uh, with death, I think. Big - big subject with me, yeah. I
have a very pessimistic view of life. You should know this about me if we're
gonna go out. You know, I - I feel that life is - is divided up into the
horrible and the miserable. Those are the two categories, you know. The - the
horrible would be like, um, I don't know, terminal cases, you know, and blind
people, crippled. I don't know how they get through life. It's amazing to me.
You know, and the miserable is everyone else. That's - that's - so - so - when
you go through life - you should be thankful that you're miserable because
you're very lucky to be miserable."

seems this captures the sentiment of dusty's intensifying restatement. amis does
the same thing to 'death' or at least the trappings of thwarted virility,
casting it always in the superlative for burlesque. always. the u-man's
salvation involves a woman from the demi-monde who walks the nevsky or nevsky's
from every elsewehere.

It seems odd to me that the linguists are supposed to be on the side of the philosophers, and not on the side of the psychologists and neurologists.

  If anything, I'd have imagined it would be the psychologists together with the philosophers vs the linguists and neurologists...psychology being to neurology as (a certain kind of) philosophy is to linguistics, maybe. Comments?

Just a minor point - It's very clear what the early work is book; 'das
Welt' is the subject which is then considered in relation to logical
propositions taken in various sets; the Sheffer stroke is the fundamental
process here. I read the TLP when I was 19 and have been with it on and
off since; it's the final statement of a kind of 19th-century strunctural-
ism that appeared in Hertz's mechanics, etc. In any case, yes, it helps to
know Frege and the others - Whitehead as well, but that's true of almost
all philosophy; it's not ab nihilo. To look at Derrida for example, it
helps to know Hegel, Levinas, Sartre, Heidegger of course, etc. etc. Re:
The Vienna circle - here W. pretty much stands on his own although Carnap
can't hurt.

I don't see where W. had the 'prior conviction' you mention but then I
don't remember all the details of his life.

With the Investigations the situation is very different. I don't think the
Principia Mathematica was really detailed there; it was on the TLP, and
already of course the paradoxes of mathematics destroyed the crystalline
order in terms of a constructivist axiomatics - of course you'd have to
believe that proof theory's somehow connected to ontology for the dstruc-
tion to occur.

Your point about universal grammar is really interesting; I do wonder
though if one can make a leap from language games etc. to a probmeatizing
of such a grammar. They're different epistemologies; I don't think (I may
be very wrong here) that universal grammar implies exact meaning and
denotation - if anything it seems to me it would deal with the structures
underlying language games, since, when such a game is played, as it always
is, the participants in a dialog almost always understand implicitly what
is meant. This would be a substructural affair, not an affair of defini-
tion. In other words, I don't think the opposition you set up is really
necessarily there.

From Theodor W. Adorno's "On the Question:
'What is German?' ", discussing the author's decision
to return to Germany in 1949 (quoted passage found on
pages 210-211 of  _Critical Models: Interventions and
Catchwords_ (New York, Columbia University Press,
1998, translated and with a preface by Henry W.
Pickford).  Yep, no paragraph breaks (editors must
have loved *that*!) and I haven't even provided the
whole paragraph. The words with asterisks after them,
as the translator explains in the Preface, are English
in the original.

Very interesting I think, though I wonder about
Adorno's generalization regarding "the almost
universal technique of adaption, reworking and
arranging" that scholarly/philosophical authors in
America had to submit to.


Having said this, I will risk speaking about what
facilitated my decision to return. A publisher,
incidentally a European immigrant, who was familiar
with the German manuscript of Philosophy of New Music,
expressed the wish to publish the main section of it
in English. He asked me for a rough translation. When
he read it, he found that the book, with which he was
already familiar, was "badly organized"* (schlecht
organisiert).  I said to myself that, at least in
Germany, despite all that has happened there, I would
be spared this. A few years later the same thing
happened again, only this time grotesquely
intensified. I had presented a lecture in the
Psychoanalytic Society in San Francisco and given it
to their affiliated professional journal for
publication.  In the galleys I discovered that they
had not been satisfied with improving the stylistic
deficiencies of an emigrant writer. The entire text
had been disfigured beyond recognition, the
fundamental intentions could not be recovered. To my
polite protest I received the no less polite and
regretful explanation, that the journal owes its
reputation precisely to its practice of submitting all
contributions to such editing* (Redaktion). The
editing provided the journal with its uniformity; I
would only be standing in my own way were I to forego
its advantages. Nonetheless I did forego them; today
the article can be found in the volume Sociologica II
under the title "Die revidierte Psychoanalyse"
("Psychoanalysis Revised") in a quite faithful German
translation. In it one can check whether the text
needed to be filtered through a machine, obedient to
that almost universal technique of adaptation,
reworking, and arranging, to which powerless authors
have to submit in America. I give these examples not
to complain about the country where I found refuge but
to explain clearly why I did not stay. In comparison
with the horrors of National Socialism my literary
experiences were insignificant bagatelles. But once I
had survived, it was certainly excusable that I sought
working conditions that would impair my work as little
as possible. I was perfectly aware that the autonomy I
championed as the unconditional right of the author to
determine the integral form of his production had, at
the same time, something regressive about it in
relation to the highly rationalized commercial
exploitation even of spiritual creations.  What was
being demanded of me was nothing other than the
logically consistent application of the laws of highly
advanced economic concentration to scholarly and
literary products.  However, what represents progress
according to the standards of adaptation inevitably
meant regression according to the standards of the
subject matter itself...

hi Murat,
I think this is the fundamental problem of wittgenstein on which pretty much everybody either misunderstands him or goes too far in the direction he was trying to avoid going.

wittgenstein doesn't argue that "life is meaningless" he argues that the class of question "what is the meaning of life?" is is a member is nonsensical. the key distinction here is between nonsensical (unzinning) sentences and senseless (sinnloss) sentences. a nonsensical sentence might still have a use for our form of life, and therefore have a kind of meaning that is different from what is meant by "the meaning of a word." a senseless sentence on the other hand is merely something that doesn't fit in the grammar. like "car water uncomfortably green mayonaise jar." nonsense has a purpose, and it's important to understand that the reason people try to say these things is not because they're stupid or that they're deluded. They try to say these things because it's important what they're trying to say, and a part of our form of life to try to say it. It's just that it's equally important to recognize that in doing so, you're "running your head up against the walls of language."

Again, it's not that there is no such thing as metaphysics, it's that it's not possible to say anything sensible about metaphysics. There's the world, there's us in it, there's our interactions with the world and the world's interactions with itself. There's no way to "go deeper" than that. That doesn't mean there isn't a "deeper" there, but to say there is or there isn't is not to say something that can really be understood except in the most shallow ways. We can, on the other hand, show that there is something there, and in this case language is working more like a finger pointing at a ball, then a sign on the ball that reads "ball". I can say "that, that's what i want to talk about, right there" but I can't go any further than that indexical expression because I have no public grounds by which I can tell if I'm using my words correctly or not. All i can do is stipulate what the correct
meanings of the words are, which is really all that metaphysics boils down to, stipulating the meanings of words and arguing over whose stipulations bear the best fruit, best depending almost entirely on which bullets you're willing to bite and what your intuitions tell you must be the case.

Up to that point, Wittgenstein and I agree. However I don't think he ever went far enough with his mysticism to the point where he realized just how much could be said with nonsense. I always wondered what might have happened if late in life he'd seriously studied the Chuangzi and the Tao Te Ching. Unfortunately I think his cultural and aesthetic biases, growing up in the efete and culturally strangled air of fin de siecle Vienna, prevented him from realizing some of the same things Joseph Campbell went on to realize about the power of myth and folklore. Wittgenstein's remarks on the the golden bough, in which he remarks on Frazier's misunderstanding of magic in other cultures is very much a joseph campbell kind of read on the problems of cultural translation.

I on the other hand am of the opinion that this "showing" of wittgensteins is much more subtle and able to be directed than he was. I think that's what good poetry always does is to point in someway at something that can't be plainly said. that's what devices like metaphor and allusion are for, but in reality I think most of the language arts get there in someway, but poetry in particular has that as it's workspace. Wittgenstein, no fan of modernism in any form, would beg to differ. But then he was also the first to admit that he didn't understand any of it and did not like the world as it was because he could not understand it.

But as to the question of vagueness, i may have done uncle ludwig a disservice in my exegesis. His point isn't that vagueness is better than precision, or vice versa, but that both have their uses, and what matters is the task you have before you and what demands it makes. If you're building a raft out of logs, you can probably eyeball most of your measurements and get things roughly in line with each other, and there's no need to measure down to the sub-micron level. That might be important though if you're building a particle collider, though.

Wittgenstein's point is that sometimes we let ourselves be led astray by a pursuit of precision where no great deal of precision is warranted, and in fact the pursuit of precision will prevent you from getting where you want to go. you end up with a raft the logs of which are exactly the same length, but which nevertheless are full of holes and sink the minute they hit the water.

Protolanguage is actually used (I think the author is Bickerton not sure) to
represent infant's babble before the syntactical 'explosion.'

I use analogical to call forth a number of things - Rosset's idea of the
'idiotic real' or inert, obdurate; the smoothing integration across the digital
or any form of inscription; the 'prior' inchoate of inscription; what remains
of the real after political economy is subtracted. ...

Actually if I remember, the work was a satire on 'What is to be Done' - but the
way you read it is now I think the way we have to read it.

But not the death of the old; I don't personally believe in succession of this
sort.

Brian Welch of the band KORN came for a book signing at the Barnes & Noble
where I work at today (well, it's officially yesterday, since it's past
midnight).

He's recently found Jesus (NOT ANOTHER ONE!) and wrote a book for the
occasion.

While he was signing books and talking with his fans I decided when would be
the best time to ask him my question.  This is the result, which I'm going
to add to my ongoing poem CELEBRITIES I'VE SEEN OFFSTAGE
http://seenOFFstage.blogspot.com

ME:  Hey Brian, with your new religious values what are your views about the
war?
BRIAN:  Ah man, ah, I don't know, ah, I don't think about that kinda stuff.
You know?  Ah.
ME:  But we're in the fourth year of the war.
BRIAN:  Ah, I don't know, ah.  I'm just trying to get my life together.

That's it?  That's all he had to say?  Yes!  That's all he had to say!  His
nation is AT WAR!  His nation has INVADED AND OCCUPIED another nation!

And I was actually hoping to be surprised, and to be proven wrong about
those who surrender to Jesus.  But he's empty, and even while I was
listening to the stupid things he had to say to his young fans about THE
SOUL that KORN has in its music (really?  hm, I don't remember hearing
SOUL!), crap like that, shitty, dumb little small talk kind of shit, but
while I was listening to all of the chatter I was still thinking to myself
that MAYBE, just MAYBE he was just trying to get through the book signing
and had other thoughts to share.  There was part of me that wanted to be
blown away by a beautiful, unexpected world view.

No.  Nothing.  Zippo!  "I don't think about that kinda stuff."  Really?
Wow!

Some super KORN fan woman who overheard me complain to a coworker about how
incredibly disappointing Welch turned out to be said to me, "He's a rock
star!  Rock stars don't have time for such things!"

And I said, "Oh, really?  Have you ever heard of Bono?  How about Patti
Smith?  How about Marilyn Manson, or Sinead O'Conner, or about fifteen other
rock stars who GIVE A DAMN!  Rock stars who constantly talk out against war,
talk out against cruelty, talk about changing this world and making it
better?"

How about John Lennon?

What a bunch of bullshit this Brian Welch is!  There I am at my stupid
little bookshop job making JUST BARELY enough to pay the rent and
electricity, and my tiny bit of tax dollars are going to pay for bullets for
machine guns over in Iraq to kill people.  But Brian Welch is A
MILLIONAIRE!  And his tax dollars are buying truck loads of machine guns for
Iraq!  Is it okay to not know "about that kinda stuff"?

How is it okay for any American to not know about it?

How is it okay for every American to not think about the war every single
fucking day?  This is YOUR war!  This is MY war!  It belongs to us!  This
misery is OUR MISERY-MAKING MACHINE!

WE ARE IN FUCKING OVERDRIVE MY BROTHERS AND SISTERS!  WE ARE KILLING AND
KILLING AND KEEPING A CLOSE LINE OPEN TO THE COFFIN MAKERS TO PREDICT THE
NEXT SHIPMENT!

I'm so disturbed by this guy.  His tattoos and piercings and crazy hair is
nothing more than costume.  He's not radical, not radical in any way at
all.  He's maintaining the worst values of willful ignorance.  And he's JUST
joined one of the most ridiculous religions on the planet!  Worship of a
martyr!  Worship of a suicide!

How deflating the globe seems on the surface of such a pool of greasy
thought.

Maybe I should have asked him what candidate he thinks is best?  Who is he
voting for?  Is he registered?

I wish I owned a KORN CD so I could SMASH it!

ABSOLUTELY FUCKING DISGUSTED!

i'm not sure what you mean, david.

the RubBeings are 'concrete' in the feel of their relation with the
physical. but usually they are also more informed by visual art than typical
concrete, which was usually in closer proximity with the page.

here's a poem by lionel kearns from 1965 called 'Birth of God/uniVerse' (he
abreviates it as 'BoG') that is some 'original digital visual poetry':
http://vispo.com/kearns/bog1.htm . this is from a 1969 book of his called
'By the Light of the Silvery McLune: Media Parables, Poems, Signs, Gestures,
and Other Assaults on the Interface'.

With regard to "the autonomy I championed as the unconditional right of the author," however, check the correspondence between Adorno as an editor of the Zeitschrift fur Sozialforschung and Walter Benjamin as author of "Paris of the Second Empire."

Stephen Baraban <stephen_baraban@YAHOO.COM> wrote:  From Theodor W. Adorno's "On the Question:
'What is German?' ", discussing the author's decision
to return to Germany in 1949 (quoted passage found on
pages 210-211 of _Critical Models: Interventions and
Catchwords_ (New York, Columbia University Press,
1998, translated and with a preface by Henry W.
Pickford). Yep, no paragraph breaks (editors must
have loved *that*!) and I haven't even provided the
whole paragraph. The words with asterisks after them,
as the translator explains in the Preface, are English
in the original.

Very interesting I think, though I wonder about
Adorno's generalization regarding "the almost
universal technique of adaption, reworking and
arranging" that scholarly/philosophical authors in
America had to submit to.


Having said this, I will risk speaking about what
facilitated my decision to return. A publisher,
incidentally a European immigrant, who was familiar
with the German manuscript of Philosophy of New Music,
expressed the wish to publish the main section of it
in English. He asked me for a rough translation. When
he read it, he found that the book, with which he was
already familiar, was "badly organized"* (schlecht
organisiert). I said to myself that, at least in
Germany, despite all that has happened there, I would
be spared this. A few years later the same thing
happened again, only this time grotesquely
intensified. I had presented a lecture in the
Psychoanalytic Society in San Francisco and given it
to their affiliated professional journal for
publication. In the galleys I discovered that they
had not been satisfied with improving the stylistic
deficiencies of an emigrant writer. The entire text
had been disfigured beyond recognition, the
fundamental intentions could not be recovered. To my
polite protest I received the no less polite and
regretful explanation, that the journal owes its
reputation precisely to its practice of submitting all
contributions to such editing* (Redaktion). The
editing provided the journal with its uniformity; I
would only be standing in my own way were I to forego
its advantages. Nonetheless I did forego them; today
the article can be found in the volume Sociologica II
under the title "Die revidierte Psychoanalyse"
("Psychoanalysis Revised") in a quite faithful German
translation. In it one can check whether the text
needed to be filtered through a machine, obedient to
that almost universal technique of adaptation,
reworking, and arranging, to which powerless authors
have to submit in America. I give these examples not
to complain about the country where I found refuge but
to explain clearly why I did not stay. In comparison
with the horrors of National Socialism my literary
experiences were insignificant bagatelles. But once I
had survived, it was certainly excusable that I sought
working conditions that would impair my work as little
as possible. I was perfectly aware that the autonomy I
championed as the unconditional right of the author to
determine the integral form of his production had, at
the same time, something regressive about it in
relation to the highly rationalized commercial
exploitation even of spiritual creations. What was
being demanded of me was nothing other than the
logically consistent application of the laws of highly
advanced economic concentration to scholarly and
literary products. However, what represents progress
according to the standards of adaptation inevitably
meant regression according to the standards of the
subject matter itself...

Jason,

Once again, your post is full of fascinating observations, and I will try to
respond to them tangentially, in spots. Otherwise, we would get entangled
'in the grapevines of language."

"a nonsensical sentence might still have a use for our form of life, and
therefore have a kind of meaning that is different from what is meant by
"the meaning of a word.": What is this meaning of a "nonsensical language"?
Can you (or Wittgenstein) elaborate on that, without being entangled in the
deficiencies of one's own thought? At most, after a lip service, isn't the
exploration of what that meaning is dropped?

"a senseless sentence on the other hand is merely something that doesn't fit
in the grammar. like "'car water uncomfortably green mayonaise jar'": do you
mean a lot of language poetry (or of the post avant kind) is senseless? (O.K.,
just kidding!)

No, Wittgenstein says it's not possible to say anything sensible in
metaphysics, while all he is involved in is metaphysics. That's why we still
read him, while we still consider him trapped in a contradiction ("a theory
doomed to be nonsensical" - a nonsensical performance/poem).

Well, when pointing is not a language, why  such an arbitrary limit? As you
say later, can't poetry basically be a pointing, "a coup de des," in space?


then a sign on the ball that reads "ball". I can say "that, that's what i
> want to talk about, right there" but I can't go any further than that
> indexical expression because I have no public grounds by which I can tell if

Once again, who determined that establishing "public grounds" is the measure
by which one will legitimize the correctness of a language. Linguistic
philosophy basically "proves" something by acting as if mathematics. It
defines a given word in an over-precise, limiting way way. Then it "proves"
that a certain activity within that precise (axiom-like) meaning of the word
is impossible. There is something tyrannical -ideological- in this process,
denying the possibility or the legitimacy of the other (the outside). Since
this branch of linguistic philosophy is an offshoot of logical positivism
(or what I would call fundamentalist empiricism) has a Western ideological
bent to it.

I must acknowledge that Wittgenstein himself never used the trick of
misapplying mathematics, its tautological insular/circular thinking to
metaphysics. As far as I can see, he accepting rather to live within its
contradictions; but very few of his followers showed the same understanding.

The fact is that very few words in a language have fixed, completely defined
meanings. This has little to do with grammar (Chomskian or otherwise), but a
lot to do with the open ended nature of words to change and move in
unexpected directions, assume unexpected meanings (that's what metaphor is),
as they are interacting with new cultural forces. In other words, the
impossibility of a final definition to be given to a word is the linguistic
equivalent of freedom. And imposing such pre-emptive, partly arbitrary
definitions on words is the linguistic, ideological equivalent of tyranny.


All i can do is stipulate what the correct meanings of the words are, which
> is really all that metaphysics boils down to,


No, metaphysicis is to swim in the river of ambiguity, between two shores,
which is what Wittgenstein, among others, does.


stipulating the meanings of words and arguing over whose stipulations bear
> the best fruit, best depending almost entirely on which bullets you're
> willing to bite and what your intuitions tell you must be the case.


What kind of fruit are you talking about? Is it the fruit of pragmatic
usefulness, which I think very often the motive, the assumed norm behind
these analyses? What does intuition tell us about this question?

    Up to that point, Wittgenstein and I agree. However I don't think he
ever went far enough with his mysticism to the point where he realized just
how much could be said with nonsense.

If he acknowledged his mysticism, he knew his whole edifice would fall.
Though he had to practice it without "naming" it, therefore, never
subjecting his own activities to the "rigors of a definition."

"Poetry, I also hate it." Didn't Robert Foreman say something similar about
the theater?

I don't really think that's what Wittgenstein means.  As I see it, he is
referring to the basic ambiguity of language, of words (their implicit
openness), what I have talked about. Of course, spelled out in a "precise
way," he may object to this assertion.


Wittgenstein's point is that sometimes we let ourselves be led astray by a

Was Wittgenstein really such a good boy, a good Viennese (middle class and
pragmatic) or basically insane? Bertrand Russel seems to have sensed this
quality about him the moment he met him at Cambridge. If I remember
correctly, he says [I am paraphrasing], "he was either a madman or genius.
He was a genius." Why not both, that's what the nature of his ambiguity and
fate was: to create a metaphysical poem, maybe his worst fear.

I said to a new person, "I had had this rock band thing" -- by way of  saying
my life had gone out to sea -- but since it hadn't been my rock band  thing,
but someone else's rock band, it took years to realize what I should have
said when I showed up safe on shores of heaven, of home, "that rock band  thing,"
instead of my faults & errors & the need for  religions. The sailors were
living in New York and Madison and Binghamton  -- they had their addresses --
there had not been a sailor in any of the  rock bands in Houston.  There were
guitar players, and as happens with  talent sometimes, the guitar players were
too talented.  There could not be  places for all of them in a single rock band.
 Too many of them were too  talented and their birthdays were May 1 and Oct.
31, 1966.  One was born on  the same day & year as JFKJr.  One was a Cancer
and could overhear  voices.  Korn was one of their bands.  They were mean or
neglectful or  cavalier toward women.  Cavalier was kind of nice.  In fact, I
had myself wishing that the new person could be cavalier, to let there be a door
 ajar to the past.  Instead, the new person was nice and I did not resemble
the me from my rock band thing.  He had been a bodyguard and had met many
famous people -- not famous like my Pulitzer- and Nobel laureates -- famous like
B.B. King -- and had once broken a man's arm who had messed with a woman.
He was telling me this in an Irish public house, and an American with  an
Australian accent, a sea-nymph, was listening to us -- he said she was  rubbing up
on him during the story, but I couldn't see it because she was  on his other
side.  I had dreamt of it, to know that fury (to break an  arm) as he quoted
MacBeth  ...   AMB

I agree with you that everyone should care about the war.  But you were probably wrong to expect a current rock star to have a coherent answer about it or anything.  All such people care about is their careers.  We have to look elsewhere for social, political, and intellectual inspiration.  But so what?  Popular culture is mostly empty and geared to the fools who consume it anyway.  Regards, Tom Savage

SOUL that KORN has in its music (really? hm, I don't remember hearing
SOUL!), crap like that, shitty, dumb little small talk kind of shit, but
while I was listening to all of the chatter I was still thinking to myself
that MAYBE, just MAYBE he was just trying to get through the book signing
and had other thoughts to share. There was part of me that wanted to be
blown away by a beautiful, unexpected world view.

No. Nothing. Zippo! "I don't think about that kinda stuff." Really?
Wow!

Some super KORN fan woman who overheard me complain to a coworker about how
incredibly disappointing Welch turned out to be said to me, "He's a rock
star! Rock stars don't have time for such things!"

And I said, "Oh, really? Have you ever heard of Bono? How about Patti
Smith? How about Marilyn Manson, or Sinead O'Conner, or about fifteen other
rock stars who GIVE A DAMN! Rock stars who constantly talk out against war,
talk out against cruelty, talk about changing this world and making it
better?"

How about John Lennon?

What a bunch of bullshit this Brian Welch is! There I am at my stupid
little bookshop job making JUST BARELY enough to pay the rent and
electricity, and my tiny bit of tax dollars are going to pay for bullets for
machine guns over in Iraq to kill people. But Brian Welch is A
MILLIONAIRE! And his tax dollars are buying truck loads of machine guns for
Iraq! Is it okay to not know "about that kinda stuff"?

How is it okay for any American to not know about it?

How is it okay for every American to not think about the war every single
fucking day? This is YOUR war! This is MY war! It belongs to us! This
misery is OUR MISERY-MAKING MACHINE!

WE ARE IN FUCKING OVERDRIVE MY BROTHERS AND SISTERS! WE ARE KILLING AND
KILLING AND KEEPING A CLOSE LINE OPEN TO THE COFFIN MAKERS TO PREDICT THE
NEXT SHIPMENT!

I'm so disturbed by this guy. His tattoos and piercings and crazy hair is
nothing more than costume. He's not radical, not radical in any way at
all. He's maintaining the worst values of willful ignorance. And he's JUST
joined one of the most ridiculous religions on the planet! Worship of a
martyr! Worship of a suicide!

How deflating the globe seems on the surface of such a pool of greasy
thought.

Maybe I should have asked him what candidate he thinks is best? Who is he
voting for? Is he registered?

I wish I owned a KORN CD so I could SMASH it!

ABSOLUTELY FUCKING DISGUSTED!

There was that Paris Review interview...so maybe the beats were just
able to successfully wishful think bissett in.

Writers at Work: The Paris Review Interviews, Fourth Series, pp
538-572

Poet Aram Saryoyan and Duncan McNaughton accompanied interviewer Ted
Berrigan when he visited Kerouac at his home in Lowell in 1967.

Kerouac: ...You know who's a great poet? I know who the great poets are.

Interviewer: Who?

Kerouac: Let's see, is it...William Bissette of Vancouver. An Indian
boy. Bill Bissette, or Bisonnette.

Hi all,



After a flagrant delay unbeknownst to the public at large, House Press is
pleased to finally release Barrett Gordon's *rainbow-Grey *=97where rubs fr=
om
the street & domicile kiss on a paper noodle, & the nym "Dude" is brought
back; musings on the weathers under & over the town of Frottage.



rubbings and text on paper, 8.5x14

3 double-sided pamphlet broadsides

As well, we've made somewhat more vulnerable(available) the precursor to th=
e
above work. *graverubber* =97taking up the page as interface between living=
 &
dead / writer & writ, "rubber" gets the twist, hatting the page [over the
grave to "catch" the rubbing] like a 'rubber' would, bringing questions lik=
e
what in the "catch" remains to bear? A light touch over a heavy process;
playful, creepy, good for the far-sighted; stone / cran meditations,
sweating off an odd, pseudo-necrophilic binge in the early parks.



grave rubbings on paper, 8.5x14

1 letter / 1 grave

Aside from never believing KORN to
be the authentic article...
just another self-entitled, over-the-hill
grunge act. As for Welch, himself... he's
probably just gearing up to play those
concerts the dumbass Baldwin Brother
is throwing to drag X-TREME sports
kids into the BIG SUNDAY TENT...

Yes, the days of  Phil Ochs and even
RAGE AGAINST THE MACHINE
are long gone (even though Rage seems to
be surfacing again).

I know of no rockstar (or even most movie
stars, politicians or poets, myself included),
who has said: "I want to go and expose every
one of those secret rendition palaces scattered
all over, I want to be at every front, I don't
ever want to be what they call "safe," I want
to be there, I want to join with my so-called
enemies to either turn them (or at least deal with
them directly), I want to understand what is
happening & share my knowledge with as
many as I can possibly reach.

I hear no rockstar saying: "I would wish my life
to turn into one great prayer. One great peace."
It's not in the nature... theirs or in many others.

In the meantime, your blog chastens the phonies
and toasts the true ones more handily than any few
words here ever could... So thanks for it!

Here is an interesting post by Clay Shirky ( http://tinyurl.com/ypecnf ) on
Luddism and a remark by Keen (who wrote 'The Cult of the Amateur'). The
responses to the post (among which is a response by Shirky to some of the
responses) are worth reading also. Basically, the article looks at a common
effect technologies have had on production: bringing the cost down to
consumers; devaluing the goods; and Shirky describes resistance to this as
Luddism.

Here are two related pieces ( http://tinyurl.com/27r9uv and
http://tinyurl.com/2lq6c7 ) by Michael Gorman, author of "Our Enduring
Values: Librarianship in the 21st Century". He rails against Wikipedia and
the devaluing of encyclopedias and education he sees in the digital age.

Here is a new and related piece by Kenny Goldsmith of ubu.com (
http://tinyurl.com/3dz8pn ) called "Writing's Crisis v.1.0". He begins like
so:

"With the rise of the web, writing has met its photography. By that I mean,
writing has encountered a situation similar to what happened to painting
upon the invention of photography, a technology so much better at doing what
the art form had been trying to do, that in order to survive, the field had
to alter its course radically. If photography was striving for sharp focus,
painting was forced to go soft, hence Impressionism. Faced with an
unprecedented amount of digital available text, writing needs to redefine
itself in order to adapt to the new environment of textual abundance."

The piece is related to the others in that, again, it's concerned with
responses to abundance, in this case of writing and poetry.

****************

A couple of responses to Kenny's piece.

Suppose it's true, as I think it is, that the net creates a textual
abundance that devalues the typical output of writers. This is not going
away. Print will not simply reassert itself and re-establish the status quo.
It is an ongoing issue from here on in.

Then things like net art will also be ongoing from here on in. Same with
video art. They aren't over. They continue to adapt to changing technology
and the changing world. The story on them is not finished. Certain strains
of them start and finish quicker than net art itself, or video art itself.

Ken says that the art world fell out of love with net art because it turned
into the province of programmers, not artists. It is of course possible that
someone can be both an artist and a programmer. Surely that's one of the
several large challenges of working as an artist with digital media; the
most fundamental phenomenological observation one can make about computers
is that they're programmable; that's what separates them from previous
machines; that's what gives them their radical flexibility as machines,
flexibility to the point that there is no proof, and probably never will be,
that there are thought processes of which humans are capable and computers
are not. This isn't to say that interesting net art or digital writing
*must* be programmed; there are other issues involved in the changes brought
about by computers and digital networks etc. But certainly
artist-programmers have a radically flexible medium available to them that
is hardly exhausted, and intrepid work will continue both as net art and as
offline work in writing, in other arts, and in syntheses of arts and media.

Whether it is the darling of the art world is of little concern,
particularly if the art world is protective against innovative, imaginative
interlopers; such gatekeeping can only devalue art itself as the province of
thinkers and original creators of art.

In any case, it's interesting how all the URLs above key on the issue of
scarcity/abundance.

I was always told (on the street anyway) that KORN stood for "Keep on running, N____r (an epithet that just had a symbolic burial with a coffin and everything the other day). If this is true, then complaining about ideational content in one of its member's little heads is like complaining that Ronald Reagan's jelly bean jar had too many yellow ones in it.

I once sat with Allen Ginsberg at a bissett reading, oh, way back in
the early seventies,
and Allen heard bill doing his sound, and said he must have learned
chanting from
some Asians. I said actually no, that's bill.

And we all thought it was funny when Kerouac said bill's an Indian.
His dad a judge in Nova Scotia and all . . . .

No, really.
Bill has a place in Toronto
and a place in Vancouver.
For decades when you give him a ride home
he gets you to drop him off on a corner
and take off before he goes to his place.
I used to have an address way up north
where he was a short order cook
but he doesnt do that any more.
It's just that Karl Siegler, is Bill's great champion
and also boss of Talonbooks.

I had a great teacher who told me, when we read _On the Road_, that 'beat' was
short for beatitude. Its funny but I can't seem to find anyone else who wants
to talk about that but I keep looking. What would Bill Bissett consider
beatific I wander?

Well, that is a pretty standard observation. Kerouac said it; a great
number
of writers about Kerouac have said it.

Your rant about that Brian guy is terrific. Good on you.

I didn't know there was a rock band called Korn.

In fact it was just this year that I heard there was a squaresville
poet named Korn.

What's with this Korn stuff?

That guy Brian's phrase "that kind of stuff" etc
is unbvelievably drugged out, TVed out.

Yesterday I heard of some hiphop guy named , or maybe it is a group
named
Bone Thugs,

Got uplifting lyrics, yes, here is the revolution, let's make the world

If you a bitch, me slap you down
And fuck you up with dick
Because the villanous killer

The trigger unloads on your shit

dear list -

my friend, scholar and poet Camille PB (http://elgg.net/cpb/weblog), is
looking to sub-lease her Paris flat during August. it's a good price and
she's eager to help out a needy poet who might need a roof in Paris.

cheers

Hello,
I am willing to rent my flat this August for the whole month. It is located
in the neighborhood of Montmartre, a little further north, in the 18th
arrondissement. Here is a link to the description that I posted to
Craiglist:
http://paris.craigslist.org/sub/370374636.html

Please request more photos.

I will lower the price consequently for people who want to take the whole
month: 700 euros all utilities included + wi-fi/adsl internet + free calls
to the US and the UK (and almost everywhere else).

-- The Concealed Essence of the Hevajara Tantra with the Commentary
Yogaratnamala, G.W.. Farrow and I. Menon, trans., II, 4, Seals

From the Yogaratnamala Commentary:
kollai (Kollagiri): Refers to the Pitha (shrine) of that name.
mummuni: Refers to the Ksetra of that name.
bola ... kakkola (male sexual organ ... female sexual organ): Indicates
the meeting, although they are initially apart, of the yogi and yogini who
are characterized by these two organs respectively.
kibida (hand-drum): Is the code word for the hand-drum.

Farrow and Menon:
kakkola - code word for the female sexual organ
bola - code work for Vajra, the male sexual organ
sandhyabhasa: Tantric Code Language. As examples of sandhyabhasa, the
Hevajra Tantra lists about twenty code words. In the Candrakirti's
Pradipodyotana commentary on Guhyasamaja Tantra sandhyabhasa is one of the
sex ways by which the contents of the tantra are interpreted. The Carya
songs of the Mahassidhas are mostly couched in code lnaguage. [...] This
code system has been discussed by various eminent scholars. Many of the
discussions have been based on the mistranslation of the word sandhyabhasa
and what constitutes instances of sandhyabhasa. In our opinion too much of
little consequence has been written on this subject.

[Sandhyabhasa is intrinsically clear; the authors' use of 'system' in the
definition above, is not. I'd like to think that sandhyabhasa mostly moves
from inscription to abjection; all of this might well be lost in the
descent to English.]

i hadn't heard about kerouac calling bissett a great poet. interesting.

bill has travelled across canada countless times doing readings for forty
some-odd years and publishes one or two books per year with talonbooks. and
many people do indeed think of him as a great poet. yet he has never won the
canadian literary prize. that seems to be controlled by other types of
poets. a pity. for canadian poetry.

the official response seems to be "he's still doing the same old thing he's
done since the sixties." i've heard this from several poets.

in truth, he is and he isn't. at one point, i read about a dozen of his
books ranging from the sixties through the eighties. what i found was that
the books just kept getting better and better. in particular, the books from
the late eighties include erm sort of prose poems, narrative prose poems
that could be several pages long, usually about his life, that were, to me,
the most interesting works and the ones that turned the books into books
rather than collections of individual poems. they are more nuanced and given
to shades of gray and deeper analysis than the lyric work.

yet he never seems to read those sorts of poems in his readings across the
country. his readings are his bread and butter, i think, and he tends to go
with shorter stuff that can be counted on to rouse the audience. that's
probably why many people think he's still doing 'the same old thing'. it's
as though his readings are his job and he rarely messes with the tried and
true at his job.

i organized a couple of readings for him and they were always packed and
high energy. i asked him to read a couple of those longer works at one of
them, and he did, very well; he expressed surprise that i asked him to read
those, said he rarely does, and is rarely asked to do so.

he is appreciated by a young audience in canada, unlike many a poet. it's a
pity for canadian poetry that his work has not been more influential in
canada. he ekes out a living as a poet doing readings and selling his books
but i don't think there has been much financial help to him apart from those
sorts of gigs. yet he's persevered at it for decades.

for years he ran his own press: blewointment.

bpNichol called him "canada's best political poet".

so it's great to see that some of his work is in the chemical brother's
single that topped the UK charts. am looking forward to listening to that
ditty, at some point.

i don't think his talonbooks books make it into the usa much. this seems to
be a problem for canadian publishers in general.

The idea that 19th century photograph--indeed, any photography until very recently--was better than painting at what painting is trying to do is simply ridiculous. Think about color, for a start. Think about scale, and the amount of detail large scale allows for. Any decent hack academic painter in the 19th century could show more about the appearance of things than any photograph could until the current era of the big-scale print (Gursky, Struth, etc.).

  The true immediate difference between the photograph and the painting was (byt maybe no longer is, in the digital era) its indexical quality--the fact that the photographic image seems to be causally connected to what it pictures, to be a trace of it, a vera icona, acheiropoieta, like Veronica's Veil--which painting could never be.

  Here is an interesting post by Clay Shirky ( http://tinyurl.com/ypecnf ) on
Luddism and a remark by Keen (who wrote 'The Cult of the Amateur'). The
responses to the post (among which is a response by Shirky to some of the
responses) are worth reading also. Basically, the article looks at a common
effect technologies have had on production: bringing the cost down to
consumers; devaluing the goods; and Shirky describes resistance to this as
Luddism.

Here are two related pieces ( http://tinyurl.com/27r9uv and
http://tinyurl.com/2lq6c7 ) by Michael Gorman, author of "Our Enduring
Values: Librarianship in the 21st Century". He rails against Wikipedia and
the devaluing of encyclopedias and education he sees in the digital age.

Here is a new and related piece by Kenny Goldsmith of ubu.com (
http://tinyurl.com/3dz8pn ) called "Writing's Crisis v.1.0". He begins like
so:

"With the rise of the web, writing has met its photography. By that I mean,
writing has encountered a situation similar to what happened to painting
upon the invention of photography, a technology so much better at doing what
the art form had been trying to do, that in order to survive, the field had
to alter its course radically. If photography was striving for sharp focus,
painting was forced to go soft, hence Impressionism. Faced with an
unprecedented amount of digital available text, writing needs to redefine
itself in order to adapt to the new environment of textual abundance."

The piece is related to the others in that, again, it's concerned with
responses to abundance, in this case of writing and poetry.

****************

A couple of responses to Kenny's piece.

Suppose it's true, as I think it is, that the net creates a textual
abundance that devalues the typical output of writers. This is not going
away. Print will not simply reassert itself and re-establish the status quo.
It is an ongoing issue from here on in.

Then things like net art will also be ongoing from here on in. Same with
video art. They aren't over. They continue to adapt to changing technology
and the changing world. The story on them is not finished. Certain strains
of them start and finish quicker than net art itself, or video art itself.

Ken says that the art world fell out of love with net art because it turned
into the province of programmers, not artists. It is of course possible that
someone can be both an artist and a programmer. Surely that's one of the
several large challenges of working as an artist with digital media; the
most fundamental phenomenological observation one can make about computers
is that they're programmable; that's what separates them from previous
machines; that's what gives them their radical flexibility as machines,
flexibility to the point that there is no proof, and probably never will be,
that there are thought processes of which humans are capable and computers
are not. This isn't to say that interesting net art or digital writing
*must* be programmed; there are other issues involved in the changes brought
about by computers and digital networks etc. But certainly
artist-programmers have a radically flexible medium available to them that
is hardly exhausted, and intrepid work will continue both as net art and as
offline work in writing, in other arts, and in syntheses of arts and media.

Whether it is the darling of the art world is of little concern,
particularly if the art world is protective against innovative, imaginative
interlopers; such gatekeeping can only devalue art itself as the province of
thinkers and original creators of art.

In any case, it's interesting how all the URLs above key on the issue of
scarcity/abundance.

Jim,

Thanks for this, I'm a longtime fan of Clay Shirky's writing, and find
your own thoughts on digital writing to be among my favorites, as
well. I would add a couple of responses to Kenny's piece, and to your
responses to it.

I think part of the reason the art world fell out of love with net art
is purely economic--like the music industry they are struggling to
find the saleable product in a world of infinite perfect
copying. Scarcity/abundance, as you've pointed out.

I also do not believe that net art is the province of programmers, not
artists. There are likely more programmers involved in net art than in
other forms of art, sure, but there are also many artists who have
found ways of making net art that don't require them to be 50/50
programmer/artist. Collaboration is one method, tweaking/re-arranging
existing code is another, and using complex software to do things for
which it was never originally intended.

There are also very talented programmers who do not identify
themselves as artists, but whose work probably deserves recognition as
art.

Here's more Clay Shirky, a ten minute keynote address, this time he's
talking about love as a predictor of technological success.

http://conversationhub.com/2007/07/10/video-clay-shirky-on-love-internet-style/
He closes with this quote:

"In the past, we would do little things for love, but big things
required money. Now we can do big things for love."

To me, that is very real and massive shift in what's possible for art.

Regards,
Dan

Thanks for your reflections on the relations of the rubBEings to concrete,
language, the physical/mental, conflict, translation, reading, writing,
speaking, and much else. Yes, all these issues do seem to be raised in your
work.

My experience of your rubBEings is limited to viewing the bitmap images of
them on your blog ( http://davidbaptistechirot.blogspot.com ). How big are
the physical pieces, typically? What sorts of materials do you use? You
mention clay and spraypaint.

Also, how do you think of the blog in its presentation of the work? And
versus presentation of the physical objects. How have you presented the
physical works?

Are there ways you'd like to present the works on the net that you haven't
been able to do? Or is the blog the ideal way, for you, to present them on
the net?

ja?

Dan W. is on the money I think, exposing this fallacy that only programmers
are interested in, or make "net art" or that it's somehow exclusively their
domain. And Barry's post refuting "photography creates a 'better' picture,
painting is now done" is right on. If anything it just added a new level of
visual representation for painters to work in separately and make their own, or
to combine with their more plastic creations. And it offered a method of
"holding the image" for those painters who chose to remain painters, and allowed
them to see phenomena they wanted to paint but which were too quick for the
human eye (ex. Muybridge's visual essays explicating fast movement in  living
things). Whenever one decides to write a totalizing theory essay as kenny  g.
has apparently done, you end up with the sort of gross  oversimplifications
we're hearing secondhand here...painting had to go all fuzzy  because photographs
got all sharp....that's just silly....it also implies the  singular purpose of
all painting throughout history was only the attempt to  achieve visual
verisimilitude...whatever that is, if it even exists in a way  which transcends
subjectivity (because my pictures are usually colored by  emotions
anyway)....which again is  preposterous....

This seems to radically contradict the fundamental post-modern notion, of
which unless I mis-read you you are a proponent, that all we know can only be
the result of habit and language -- that post-modern notion that there is no
vera out there for anything to be an icona of.

Shouldn't you be arguing that the painter is a _better_ representer of what he
or she imagines he or she perceives through habit and language than any
photograph could ever be? Isn't the fundamental notion of post-modern
thought that of the Third Umpire in the old joke, "Some may be balls and
some may be strikes, but they ain't nuthin' til I call 'em"?

While I somewhat agree with this statement, I wish to add that there are still many wonderful realistic painters out there who continue to add something to what photography can now provide.  One who immediately comes to mind is the wonderful Yvonne Jacquette.  Anyone who has seen a show of her magnificent paintings understands that there is still room for realistic painting to explore and pursue.

A couple of responses to Kenny's piece.

Suppose it's true, as I think it is, that the net creates a textual
abundance that devalues the typical output of writers. This is not going
away. Print will not simply reassert itself and re-establish the status quo.
It is an ongoing issue from here on in.

Then things like net art will also be ongoing from here on in. Same with
video art. They aren't over. They continue to adapt to changing technology
and the changing world. The story on them is not finished. Certain strains
of them start and finish quicker than net art itself, or video art itself.

Ken says that the art world fell out of love with net art because it turned
into the province of programmers, not artists. It is of course possible that
someone can be both an artist and a programmer. Surely that's one of the
several large challenges of working as an artist with digital media; the
most fundamental phenomenological observation one can make about computers
is that they're programmable; that's what separates them from previous
machines; that's what gives them their radical flexibility as machines,
flexibility to the point that there is no proof, and probably never will be,
that there are thought processes of which humans are capable and computers
are not. This isn't to say that interesting net art or digital writing
*must* be programmed; there are other issues involved in the changes brought

artist-programmers have a radically flexible medium available to them that
is hardly exhausted, and intrepid work will continue both as net art and as
offline work in writing, in other arts, and in syntheses of arts and media.

Whether it is the darling of the art world is of little concern,
particularly if the art world is protective against innovative, imaginative

Marcus,

I love that old joke however misapplied--there are several definitions of "postmodern" (to say nothing of postmodernism) but the particular point you're making has its roots in modernity--specifically phenomenology.

That's certainly one way of reading TLP, and it's very standard from an
analytic philosophy point of view, very much in line with Anscombe's
Introduction to The Tractatus and Russells introduction to the book. It is =
certainly the way that someone with a
commitment to a logical atomism of some kind is going to read it. To that
extent it's a valid interpretation of a very difficult book, and I wouldn't=
 say it was incorrect.

However, I do disagree with this reading. I don't take the subject of the b=
ook
to be the world. The world is mentioned briefly in the opening propositions=
,
from which wittgenstein moves quickly through his peculiar understanding of=
 the nature of facts and on to the matter of what really interests him, and=
 what the actual subject of the tractatus on my reading, and that is the st=
ructure of propositions and what can and cannot be expressed by them. I alw=
ays try to keep in mind a couple of things when reading it: 1.) the comment=
s wittgenstein made about his purpose to Russell while he was a POW in ital=
y and they were discussing either the proto-tractatus dictated to moore Or =
TLP manuscript, i don't recall which, to which russell responded that W had=
 become a mystic 2.) the comments made to non-philosopher friends and poten=
tial editors, particularly his statement that TLP consisted of two parts, t=
he first part containing everything he had written, and the second part eve=
rything he had not written, and the second part being far more important 3.=
) his statements in the introduction that his wondered if only those who'd =
thought similar thoughts would understand him, and the other statement that=
 his purpose was primarily ethical and that he thought he had shown how lit=
tle had been done by resolving the problems of philosophy.

The problem is if you take him at his word here, that the TLP is a ladder t=
o be kicked away when you get to the top, if you understand it, it's very d=
ifficult to say what you understand if wittgenstein is right if what is und=
erstood must be passed over in silence.


> I don't see where W. had the 'prior conviction' you mention but then I do=
n't

reading his letters, he pretty much tells everybody but Frege that they won=
't understand it before they read it. He eventually comes to the conclusion=
 that Frege didn't get it either, and I beleive that he was a little bit ap=
palled at the understanding that Moritz Schlick and Co. seemed to have of i=
t. It's notable that it took Frank Ramsey coming and visiting W in the vill=
age where he was teaching and spending days going over the tractatus before=
 Wittgenstein was able to 1.) recognize in ramsey someone with a mind he fe=
lt worth taking seriously and 2.) from that and ramsey's willingness to fol=
low wittgenstein through his argument in TLP, take seriously Ramsey's objec=
tions and realize that TLP might not be the last word after all. What i thi=
nk it illustrates more than anything is how wittgenstein's personal perfect=
ionism and the attendant sense of superiority that it brought with it was a=
s much an obstacle to Wittgenstein being understood, and to him being able =
to make himself understood, as was the difficulty and strangeness of his su=
bjects.

I tend to read both the so-called "private language" argument, as well as t=
he comments on intention and vaguness both in PI as well as Zettel, and in =
the foundational remarks in PI beginning at PI 13 and picking up steam at P=
I 38 as definitely engaged with the ideas of the logical atomists and the p=
roblems with what russell took to calling "the philosophy of logical analys=
is".

The point of language games is that the function as a standin for a languag=
e so that we can look at a limited case without taking the language holisti=
cally, which is Wittgensteins view of what a language is. There's a common =
error that get's repeated so often by people who really ought to know bette=
r (richard rorty and hilary putnam just to name two prominent examples) tha=
t it becomes taken to be a valid reading of Wittgenstein although it really=
 isn't. The error is to think that wittgenstein considers language games co=
nstituent parts of language, and that what wittgenstein thinks a language i=
s is the set of all language games played by speakers of that language. Thi=
s isn't correct at all. The process of imagining a language game is a metho=
d for trying to liberate the mind from the philosophical dead ends one gets=
 into when we start asking questions about what such and such a word means.=
 To this end it is often necessary to imagine language games that are simil=
ar to ours but with crucial differences. For example, the language game of =
the shopkeeper in PI 1. Nobody actually uses names or numbers or color samp=
les in that way, part of the reason imagining the language game as W descri=
bes it is to show that Augustine's picture of how language works is a littl=
e bit ridiculous. =20

Where the idea of Universal Grammar runs into trouble is due to the fact th=
at it's relatively easy to imagine not only language games which did not fi=
t into whatever framework Prof. Chomsky believes should be the essence of U=
niversal Grammar this week, but that it's equally simple to imagine how suc=
h a language would be taught and how it would be used. And then of course, =
there's the fact that these sorts of languages actually do exist. There's b=
een some popular coverage recently of Daniel Everett's work on Piraha, whic=
h doesn't have either color words or a grammatical structure for recursion,=
 both of whcih are problems for chomsky's UG, since the number of things wh=
ich can be taken as common to all languages is rapidly dwindling.=20

But even so, it should be possible to construct a language that's perfectly=
 intelligible and doesn't have any sort of universal grammar beyond some ba=
sic things that are determined more by the world than they are by anything =
specific about human beings, the presence of subjects and objects in senten=
ces, adjectives nouns and verbs, that sort of thing. And really, this is wh=
at Wittgenstein is getting at with his more obtuse statements about "forms =
of life" and the possibility of translating lionese. The strictures placed =
on our languages aren't grammars, but our grammars are largely determined b=
y what we are and how we interact with the world. Which, I think, is enough=
 to solve the problems that UG is proposed to solve without speculating all=
 manner of root level grammar that is subject to the problems raised by the=
 Private language argument.

I posted this at the Amazon site but thought I should post it here as
well, just trying to get the word out on an amazing "new" book.

Excuse the cross posting (is that what that means????)

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

I think even those of us who love John Wieners' poetry have been taken
aback, in fact bowled over by the greatness of his hitherto unknown BOOK
OF PROPHECIES, written in the 1969-1971 period right after NERVES and
preceding BEHIND THE STATE CAPITOL OR CINCINATTI PIKE, but whatever, we're
all happy now.  Halfway through the book you can trace the mark, so
obivous it feels like an actual physical thing, perhaps a torso in marble
missing an arm or two, where Wieners must have decided that the lyric
style of NERVES, ASYLUM POEMS, etc., just wasn't going to cut it for him
any more and it was time to move onto the "derangements" of his later
style, the accent on language's materiality, the "cut up" effects, the
slide into a slippery first person multiplicity.  It's fascinating just
from a biographical point of view, and in effect what you get is a whole
mini-anthology of two very different strains in Wieners' writing, and this
BOOK OF PROPHECIES provides wonderful example of both styles.

The other night there was a launch for this book at New College here in
San Francisco, and as reader after reader took the stage to read from this
book, we were struck by how many of these poems, which we had never heard
before, had the force and the "click" of what amounts to instant classics.
 They were new to us, and yet we felt we had known them forever.  As it
happens, a few poems will be already familiar to you from this book, as
Wieners published them separately or in magazines and they wound up in the
old Black Sparrow SELECTED POEMS, only now in their full context they make
sense, and accrue a patina or lustre of richness which they lacked before,
appealing as they were in their abandoned state.

The book itself is physically beautiful, and the young Boston-bnased poet
Michael Carr has done a fantastic service by providing this transcription
of a "lost" Wieners notebook--replete with some scans of the actual
holograph--with a fine sensitivity to Wieners' variegated methods of
punctuation, spelling, line break, revision, and so forth.  (At the end of
1991 the notebook itself was bought by Kent State Special Collections in
Ohio, where Carr "discovered" it.)  The poet Jim Dunn, who was close to
Wieners in the final years of JW's life, has written an introduction that
might be a model for this sort of thing, a memoir and an appreciation in
one, in which he doesn't seek to shield the reader from the immense
difficulties of reading Wieners, nor does he romanticize Wieners'
psychological and physical ruin.

"I died no one/ as I once felt I had/ to be someone."  He is the poet oh
heartbreak, and the shadow figure enslaved by the more vigorous and
together figures in his life, like Olson or Creeley, feeling himself
hardly human in his pale remnants of a life.  Both shamed and inspired, as
well, by the superhuman, glamorous Hollywood actresses and female artists
he had glimpsed on screen, or met in "real life," from Jean Seberg and
Barbara Stanwyck to nico and Nell Rice, Grace Hartigan and Phyllis Webb.
A BOOK OF PROPHECIES begins, eerily enough, with the single poem, "2007,"
a Blakean, ecstatic prediction of a moment tragically removed from our
own, his vision of Aquarius in "full flowers" and "music string and forms
of verse controlled symbolism."  The poems don't always work, and a couple
of them dangle sadly into a ludic space, but the best of them are among
the greatest poems Wieners ever wrote, and that's saying something.  At
the launch I read "Sexual Despair," nearly made myself cry out loud with
repressed longing and hardcore sex tension.  "I need you, my little son/ /
to be beside me in bed/ jerking your meat and/ smoking hash-hish/ /What
will the future bring/ this fear ling-/ ers every day."  Well, as you can
see, all I am saying is, this is a signal event for poetry and a rare
opportunity to re-assess the work of an authentic lyric genius.

Even though it's a discussion of painting it ends up back in linguistics, I think....(not saying it's composed of language though, not going nominalist, i still think the world is first..."blind faith?") if we are talking "vera icona," that is.?And back to Wittgenstein we go with the question of ultimate subjectivity...or verifiable objectivity. Even if you use the alleged ultimate verisimilitude of trompe l'oeil as "test case"?(the classic stories from antiquity--pre-urban legends,amusing--of painters so good birds flew to their fruit, or painted monsters frightened people to death) we still only know people are confusing the confected image for the natural image...still doesn't let one know if they are seeing the same thing ...the imagined "same" image"....if my red is your yellow and your yellow is my red, we won't have any problems believing we are talking about?the same things when we speak...even though we aren't...hence, the amusing anecdotes probably spurious about el
 greco's astigmatism...wouldn't he still paint un-elongated figures to match his lenses' deformation? yet it's comforting and generally useful not to think like that if one has a job in the Lebenswelt....but Veronica's Veil was a blood image right? not light? i guess blood is metaphorically standing in for?light here? but no definitive photo of any object exists of course. no such fair realism exists.?"an image is not an object"...wasn't that in a marjorie welish poem...or was that?a crib from Witt or someone she used? so true image?is a misnomer, no??

This seems to radically contradict the fundamental post-modern notion, of
which unless I mis-read you you are a proponent, that all we know can only be
the result of habit and language -- that post-modern notion that there is no
vera out there for anything to be an icona of.

Shouldn't you be arguing that the painter is a _better_ representer of what he
or she imagines he or she perceives through habit and language than any
photograph could ever be? Isn't the fundamental notion of post-modern
thought that of the Third Umpire in the old joke, "Some may be balls and
some may be strikes, but they ain't nuthin' til I call 'em"?

Although I think I reverse-engineered the Welish quote...I think it's the other way around?...."an object is not an image"...or i may be imaging it...i'm not near my books now...seem to recall this being in her book out from the univ of ga., can't think of the name right now....it had a lot of meditations on the image and the art of painting...big surprise considering the source....

This seems to radically contradict the fundamental post-modern notion, of
which unless I mis-read you you are a proponent, that all we know can only be
the result of habit and language -- that post-modern notion that there is no
vera out there for anything to be an icona of.

Shouldn't you be arguing that the painter is a _better_ representer of what he
or she imagines he or she perceives through habit and language than any
photograph could ever be? Isn't the fundamental notion of post-modern
thought that of the Third Umpire in the old joke, "Some may be balls and
some may be strikes, but they ain't nuthin' til I call 'em"?

Barry, Jim,

For the sake of economy of e-mailing, I will combine two responses.

"The true immediate difference between the photograph and the painting was
(byt maybe no longer is, in the digital era) its indexical quality--the fact
that the photographic image seems to be causally connected to what it
pictures, to be a trace of it, a vera icona, acheiropoieta, like Veronica's
Veil--which painting could never be."

Barry, that is exactly what I say In The Peripheral Space, a "thereness,"
which constitutes the underlying epistomology of phptpgraphy, its god, so to
speak. Without that quality the photographic image is meaningless.

The existence of that quality of "thereness" is exactly what Alan Sondheim
was objecting to in my essay, he assering that every photograph is "a
setup," not independently posed.

I would also like to refer to Keckler's "[photography] allowed
them [painters] to see phenomena they wanted to paint but which were too
quick for the
human eye."

Even though on one level a painter can put more details into a painting, a
photograph records things which the photographer "does not see." It is in
that respect that the pose [anything before the lens] is independent, a
record of the "unconscious" of the time/moment the photo was taken, provided
the viewer of the photograph is able to assert, discovers a new way of
looking. The Peripheral Space is about a new way of looking which involves
putting aside the photographer, his focus (which reprents the
"consciousness" of the moment the photo was taken) and developing a dialogue
between the viewer and the subject, the pose.

Digital manipulation does undermine the Platonic essence of thereness which
pre-digital photography, one assumes, contains. It is the virtue of Alan
analysis (which I hate to admit has potency to it but does not refute my
analysis) to point that manipulation of the original pose (not only the
editing in the dark room) was always part of photography. My assertion is
that digital photography revels in this technical prowess and doing so turns
photography into something else.


Jim,

Of course in our day everything must finally confront the reality of the
computer, both in the manifacture/creation of images (from photo op to art,
etc.) to the overwhelming production of information.

First observation: image and information are not the same thing. Image says
nothing but seduces. Therefore, an analysis, a deeper understanding of
seduction must become, in our time, both a political and artistic activity.
(This related partly to another thread in this list on Wittgenstein and
metaphysics, the legitimacy of metaphysics. Metaphysics is indispensable in
analyzing and fighting seduction.)

Information can be true or false, therefore, legitimate (in first analysis)
within the realm of empirical activity. But abundance changes everything.

As far as I am aware, most observations on the abundance the net creates are
approached from the point of view of production -basically how much more
information we have, etc. Relatively little has been said about the crisis
in reception this abundance creates. To use an analogy, a classical legal
trick to obfuscate is to throw everything including the kitchen sink at the
asker for information. I will give one relatively modest example, within the
purview of our own activities. In the early days of blogging, I used to
follow more or less all the blogs I can get my hands on, following in a
intimate fashion the daily thoughts, their ebbs and flows, of the owner of
the blog. Unless specifically pointed to, with rare exceptions, today I
follow hardly any. I do not know how common my experience is; but, in my
case, the abundance of blogs resulted to my reading them less seriously.

The above point is separate from the virtues or defect of the blog as a net
form. One fact is clear. Blogs were not created by poets, but initially by
creators of web sites to attract more visitors. In the poliitical domain,
blogs (and u-tube) turned out to be open, explosive forces with real impact
on political process -a kind of free, mudracking press or 18th century
broadsides. But in poetry, it seems to me, its impact has been towards
insularity or basically authoritarian structures. Why is that so, what does
it say about us as a community or poetry as an activity?

In my view, among poets, the nonluddites which I assume most people in this
list are, there has been a noncritical embrace of every new technological
option thrown in our direction. I am not claiming that one should wish to go
to a pre-lapsarian, pre-computer time; or that all the artistic and
political possibilities the computer offers -and they are mind-boggilingly
many- should not be pursued without "making an automobile in the shake of a
horse carriage." But poetry, at least in my view, should contain skepticism;
that's what wit is. I think that skepticism -at least in matters concerning
the net- does not exist in enough "abundance" among us poets.

Ciao,

Murat

Beginning in the 1860's, Carleton Watkins' mammoth glass plate photographs
in the west announce modernism. Hired by insurance companies to document
mines and other operations, the pictures have a realist factuality about
them that trumped painting, if and when 19th century painting was attempting
to parlay "realism". (Ironically, painters such as Bierdstadt (sp?) would
use W's photographs of Yosemite as a resource to transform into something
romantically grandiose). Watkins is a nineteenth and early twentieth century
anomaly in terms of pictorialist photography - where the photographers were
still trying to get the atmospherics of a painting, often rather badly.

Much of Gursky I do not see as realist at all. Like Beirdstadt, on a
different level, the digital manipulation and redistribution of the pixels
enables him to be much more about music (color, rhythm, etc.) Not quite
Wagnerian, but sometimes close. I am thinking -as one example - of those
Coliseum rock concert images. I once took Gursky to a Rova concert, and he
was right, at home with it. He is quite a music aficionado - jazz et tout.
(Not to take away at all from the influence of classical European painting
on the way he has shaped some of his work).

Anyway, the wrestling match between photography and painting - combined with
market factors - is not going to go away soon. But that's another, parallel
story: Money!

This doesn't really matter to me - whether it's 'standard' or not; I also
have no commitment to logical atomism - in fact, just the opposite.

Well, I'm reading the book differently than you, more like Nagarjuna's
Middle Way. It opens with the world, ends with something akin to
emptiness. Since the subject is announced as 1, since there are only 7
propositions (if I remember correctly), to say it's 'mentioned briefly'
doesn't seem all that relevant to me - it's the foundation of the work,
all that is the case (however one wants to translate it). To just talk
about the 'structure of propositions' it seems to me is to ignore the fact
that this _isn't_ a book on logic, but on the world, there are important
ontological shifts here that in many ware are the core of the work.

Yes and this problem is the core of the book, the world under erasure in a
sense. Here's where the ontological shift is important.

I actually didn't feel the book was that difficult, once the mathematics
was mastered, but then my reading's quite different than yours. Thank you
by the way for the biographical information; I didn't know this.

The philosophy of logical analysis and the PM are very different, unless

I'm not familiar with this work or Piraha - I'd have to know the language
myself to make any sort of comment on it. By the way starlings have
recursion - this came out last year.

Well, I'd have to see such a language; again, I can't generalize.
Certainly language developed in dialog with the world, and as Maturana
says, it's a mutual orientation of cognitive domains; these are also
dialectical. So much depends on the way the world is determinative, if at
all, and for me the jury's out on that...

I misread this to say, "information society" and "dumping down" go hand in
hand.

Yes, all this information that we most often get is dumped down on us. No
fact checking, no editorial shaping in terms of content or design.   Artles=

and stupid, finally. Dealing with it is like changing your kid's diapers
with a full load. =20

Good newspapers are beginning to crash all over the place since nobody (i.e=

Advertisers) want to pay for genuine investigations, editing, etc.

And, parenthetically, who wants to pay for genuine research and sorting out
new insight and info among scholars. I think there is less and less time an=
d
money for folks to divert from the teaching 'assembly line.' Consequently,
one suspects,most text information is old and redux (it's much cheaper to
repeat old facts).

The crisis in reception is being addressed through filtering
strategies. Some are technological (like RSS aggregators), some are
social (like digg and reddit), and some are essentially manual
(boingboing, growabrain), or even nearly private (I haven't left a
chatroom that contains 5-8 of my closest friends for a decade, and we
act as aggregators for each other). I don't think it's a crisis at
all, personally. I'd hesitate to call it a "solved problem" but it's
absolutely being worked on all over the place. A lot of money is being
thrown at it, too, because of how apparent the need for intelligent,
useful filtering the information is.

My experience is quite the opposite. I used to waste a lot of time
uselessly checking blogs for updates. RSS aggregation (I currently use
and like netvibes) alone has easily quadrupled the number of blogs I
keep up on.

I'm not sure what you mean by this, or, I may simply disagree. Blogs
were absolutely created by poets and other kinds of writers
first. They were manually written/coded and too complex for the
average web user to find attractive initially. But then some of those
individuals wrote open source solutions to help automate the processes
for others and that facilitated a level of interest that attracted the
interest of commercial companies like blogger, xanga, livejournal, and
so on, which addressed two needs quite well: benefits of built-in
community (because they pre-dated RSS, which may end up being their
undoing if they're not careful), and WYSIWYG interface (which made it
so my mom could blog).

I think it says more about the software being used than poetry as an
activity. I think it does say something about "us as a community"
though, definitely. The "community" softwares breed vapidity through
encouragement and positive re-enforcement. The latest versions which
incorporate complex tagging are helping to offset the crushing effect
of the way older posts get completely forgotten, so that's a step in
the right direction--but a very new development that will take time to
have an effect. Threaded comments would help a lot, I think,
particularly if new comments into a thread of an old post would bring
that post back to the top (as it does in many newsgroup softwares).

I agree there's been a noncritical response. I'm not so sure I'd say
"embrace" though. And I think it's not clear that most people on this
list are embracing technology at all. They are obviously connected to
the internet, and have access to email or a web browser, but--and I
don't mean this to malign listservs, I'm a huge fan of them--the
listserv is not exactly the latest and greatest way to be a digitally
connected group.

While I wouldn't disagree that there needs to be a healthy level of
skepticism in poetry, and among poets, and encourage others to be
skeptical in those regards, I want to see that skepticism be secondary
to an optimism about matters concerning the net. Let's get EXCITED
about never-before-possible ways to change the world for the better,
first, and then reality check ourselves with skepticism to make
actionable plans rather than starting with skepticism (because it's
needed) and thus dampening the enthusiasm necessary to imagine change
is possible.

There are rock stars who make a point of opening up shows with comments
about war, censorship, and other issues mobbing our senses these days.  CAT
POWER certainly does.  MARILYN MANSON has a lot to say about American
politics at shows, and there's also that impressive interview Michael Moore
did with him in BOWLING FOR COLUMBINE.

But at the same time it's probably true that these are the exceptions.

I believe very strongly that it's A GOOD THING to be disappointed.  Because
it's a good thing to keep going, and to keep asking others how they feel
about war and poverty, racism, homophobia, and other forms of cruelty and
deprivation.

First of all the very fact of being disappointed is evidence of wanting
better.  No longer being disappointed is evidence of cynicism.  And there
are few things worse than cynicism.  My grandmother used to sing a song when
I was kid that had the line, "the cynic and the killer waltz together."
Something to build a young mind around.

Brian Welch is nothing more than a wave of propaganda which continues to
swell and cover us and turn us into cynics, or, not even cynics but people
who have lost empathy.  At least a cynic is working on the platform of
caring enough to be cynical.  Those who have lost empathy are dead before
they are dead.

My disappointments, your disappointments, these things keep our
perspectives.  Brian Welch's asshole life of not caring about this world,
its wrongs, and his being complicit in its wrongs, is a mere gasp on the
train.

Being angry never felt more important,

**The Leader
http://olivejuicemusic.com/theleader.html
The Leader rock out with the dynamic grace of two sonic gymnasts (in formal

bassist Julie DeLano and drummer Sam Lazzara reign supreme over the low end=

**Rachel Lipson
http://www.rachellipson.org
http://www.myspace.com/rachellipson
Rachel Lipson is a Brooklyn-based songwriter who performs her simple, hones=
t
songs on guitar, ukulele and banjo. Born near Detroit, she spent her
childhood building forts with her brother and sister in the living room,
contemplating the dangers of the dark and pizza deliverers, riding horses
and playing with friends. Rachel first picked up a guitar at age 16 and a
few years later, after having moved to New York, began crafting the songs
that would make up her first album, This Way, which she self-released the
next year.
=20
In 2003 Rachel released a 7" with Rough Trade recording artist Jeffrey
Lewis, on Holland's Nowhere Fast record label and self-released her second
album Some More Songs. She toured Europe for seven weeks with Lewis and
Herman D=FCne in the summer, including the Mofo festival in Paris in July. In
the fall, Rachel recorded a new album at Olive Juice Studios in New York fo=
r
the forthcoming release Pastures on Meccico Records, a U.K. label founded
and run by members of Cornershop. Rachel is returning to the studio to
record the first album of her side project, The Scruffles, with bandmate
Jeffrey Lewis.
=20
In the last few years, Rachel has collaborated and performed extensively
with Leah Hayes (of La Laque and Scary Mansion), Herman D=FCne, and others.
She has also played alongside Eugene Chadbourne, Kimya Dawson, Daniel
Johnston, The Mountain Goats, and Refrigerator, as well as twice performing
live on WFMU in New Jersey and on WNYC, a division of NPR.
=20
Rachel Lipson's music combines a sort of radical simplicity and honesty wit=
h
intricately woven narratives. The lyrics seem to have as much to do with
William Faulkner as they do with Woody Guthrie. The music recalls the
earliest folk traditions and yet speaks at the same time to a contemporary
minimal aesthetic. While sometimes the approach is blindingly direct and at
others masterfully oblique, the overall effect is irresistible, one of
invitingly gentle beauty and clarity. (Biography by Blue Bomber Press)

http://www.olivejuicemusic.com/nan.html
http://www.myspace.com/nanturner
Vocally, she's the missing link between Kathleen Hanna and Juliana Hatfield=
,
with a wail matched only by her whisper. The Lucy Ricardo of indie rock, he=
r
zany, goof-ball spirit is cut only by the fierce sexuality of her drumming
style (see Schwervon!). Raised on the outskirts of Olympia, Nan was studyin=
g
theater when the riot grrrl movement seduced her into a life of rock =B9n'
roll. After several years with the power-pop girl band Bionic Finger, Nan
went solo with her jangly, eclectic EP Leg Out, but her one-woman act soon
morphed into the all-girl Pantsuit. After touring the U.K. with their
French-released The Path From the House to the Lawn, Pantsuit has
established itself as a virtual gland of playful melodies, moody sounds, an=
d
old-school feminist ferocity.
=20
Presently, Nan is writing songs on keys and guitar and experimenting live
with a rotating cast of musicians she has coined the One Night Stands. Her
new EP, For Champs and Losers, Version 1, is out now on Olive Juice Music.

The evils of enthusiasm sans skepticism are pretty well
documented--Iraq, anyone? The Third Reich? Manifest Destiny? Need I
go on? How about enthusiasm accompanied by a healthy dose of
skepticism? Otherwise, by the time skepticism gets its turn it may be
too late to reverse the damage.

I  forward this call for papers as one of the journal's editors. Maybe  =
the theme is too visual art specific to interest many members of the =
list; however, please note that proposals NOT on the theme
are also welcomed and that  Reading Room is a journal of 'art and =
culture' and we hope to embrace topics in poetry and poetics--the first =
issue included an essay of mine devoted to autobiography with specific =
reference to Ron Silliman and On Kawara. For this issue we would like to =
have material that is squarely on topic but also material that works =
from a distance from  it.=20

I'd emphasize that the deadline is only for expressions of interest. For =
more information on Reading Room please visit the Auckland Art Gallery =
website below. And feel free to email me.

CALL FOR PAPERS=20

Transcendental Pop=20

Issue 2 of Reading Room explores a paradox within contemporary art and =
culture=92s absorption of Pop. While artists continue to utilise Pop=92s =
method, =91Transcendental Pop=92 identifies a current shift in the =
infamous fascination with the everyday. Arguably, it is Warhol=92s =
defence of surface, flatness and blankness, that has been absorbed and =
referenced by subsequent generations of artists. These characteristic =
qualities have become embedded in art=92s relationship to the everyday =
=96 the =91real=92. In part, this narrow absorption of Pop=92s surface =
has allowed a paradox to occur when artists reinvest surface with =
=91depth=92, the unknown and unquantifiable. We invite an exploration of =
this apparent contradiction, something which has the potential to shift =
the art / life nexus as we know it.=20

Rather than re-examining the effect of historic Pop, this issue =
encourages writers to look at the reception and dilution of Warhol=92s =
own position. Implicit in the topic is =91the legitimacy=92, to use Jeff =
Wall=92s word, of using art to =91put one=92s finger on what makes =
society tick=92. Relevant too, is the =91second-hand=92 reception of =
Warhol=92s America outside centres of global capital (as in the case of =
Takashi Murakami); new uses of the =91enduring moment=92 or =
choreographed =91now=92 in Warhol=92s films (as in the work of Phil =
Collins); and the constructed or recycled material world (Thomas Demand =
or Rachel Harrison). There is scope here to consider key Warholian =
devices, but from perspectives not possible for Warhol, to consider =
artistic positions beyond cynicism or belief.

Deadline for expressions of interest or short abstracts relating to this =
topic extended to 31 July 2007.=20

Reading Room is a refereed journal of art and culture published annually =
by the E.H. McCormick Research Library at Auckland Art Gallery Toi o =

If you just look at the seven main propositions it definitely looks like it's a book about the nature of the world. However, if you look at the amount of commentary given to each of the seven main propositions, then it seems to me that "the world which is the totality of facts" (by TLP 1&2 (which is a really weird idea, i think, once you really get your head around what wittgenstein thinks is a fact)), the ontological issues are given very short shrift compared to the bulk of the book which is commentary on propositions 3 4 5 and 6.

3 introduces the picture theory of meaning, which is fundamental to early wittgenstein's understanding of propositions
4 links the picture theory to propositional signs
5 introduces the idea of elementary propopsitions and discusses how those are founded in the facts of the wordls
6 deals with how propositions are true or false and with their general form

Those discussions take up 80% of the book at least, which is why I think the discussion of propositions and how they have meaning is the real subject of what Wittgenstein is after.

I agree with you though that I think the place he ends up at is a fundamentally metaphysical theory, and I also think that the fact that he ended up there is one of the reasons he felt compelled to revise his work, for which reading I offer the comments he makes about "the author of the tractatus" in PI.

both the target of the PM and logical analysis are finding somesort of foundations for language. it's clear from the remarks on the foundations of mathematics and lectures on the foundations of mathematics (which are fascinating if you haven't read them, btw, particularly the extended debates during the lectures that alan turing was in attendance at) that W was very committed to the idea that mathematics was merely a specialized extension of language that dealt with certain ways of speaking. I think a lot of what W was up to in PI was trying to show that such quests for "foundations" in language by either parsing things out or formalizing everything down to first principles, is a mistaken pursuit that misses something important about the nature of language, and it is the understanding of that missing piece of the nature of language that allows people to stop doing philosophy and come to an
end of their investigations, and to transmute philosopher's nonsense into plain nonsense. I think that Wittgenstein felt he had to come at it from this angle in particular given how little he thought of Godel's incompleteness theorems and the platonism that such ideas led him to.

There was an interesting long article about it in either the New Yorker or the Atlantic Monthly a little ways back. Piraha is a really interesting language though. Apparently native speakers can more or less do away with vowels and consonants altogether and speak in a sort of tonal short hand that sounds like bird song. Everett has some links to recordings of it on his webpage and it's really worth listening to.

Agreed. Still, I feel more or less confident that I'm equipped to invent a language that's missing pretty much anything that's claimed to be universal, and more or less prove it's completeness.

Thanks for the fascinating conversation, btw.

Funny  enough, tonight, the guitarist Marnie Stern, who was the opening act for Animal Collective at the Coronet Theatre in Elephant & Castle, gave a different story about the origin of the name Korn, but I don't feel comfortable in publishing her version on a family-oriented listserv such as this. So (if you have sufficient noise tolerance) go to one of her shows and call out the question to her: "Where did Korn get their name?"

I agree with you that everyone should care about the war. But you were probably
wrong to expect a current rock star to have a coherent answer about it or
anything. All such people care about is their careers. We have to look
elsewhere for social, political, and intellectual inspiration. But so what?
Popular culture is mostly empty and geared to the fools who consume it anyway.

He's recently found Jesus (NOT ANOTHER ONE!) and wrote a book for the

You know? Ah.

BRIAN: Ah, I don't know, ah. I'm just trying to get my life together.

That's it? That's all he had to say? Yes! That's all he had to say! His
nation is AT WAR! His nation has INVADED AND OCCUPIED another nation!

And I was actually hoping to be surprised, and to be proven wrong about
those who surrender to Jesus. But he's empty, and even while I was
listening to the stupid things he had to say to his young fans about THE
SOUL that KORN has in its music (really? hm, I don't remember hearing
SOUL!), crap like that, shitty, dumb little small talk kind of shit, but
while I was listening to all of the chatter I was still thinking to myself
that MAYBE, just MAYBE he was just trying to get through the book signing
and had other thoughts to share. There was part of me that wanted to be
blown away by a beautiful, unexpected world view.

No. Nothing. Zippo! "I don't think about that kinda stuff." Really?
Wow!

Some super KORN fan woman who overheard me complain to a coworker about how
incredibly disappointing Welch turned out to be said to me, "He's a rock
star! Rock stars don't have time for such things!"

And I said, "Oh, really? Have you ever heard of Bono? How about Patti
Smith? How about Marilyn Manson, or Sinead O'Conner, or about fifteen other
rock stars who GIVE A DAMN! Rock stars who constantly talk out against war,
talk out against cruelty, talk about changing this world and making it
better?"

How about John Lennon?

What a bunch of bullshit this Brian Welch is! There I am at my stupid
little bookshop job making JUST BARELY enough to pay the rent and
electricity, and my tiny bit of tax dollars are going to pay for bullets for
machine guns over in Iraq to kill people. But Brian Welch is A
MILLIONAIRE! And his tax dollars are buying truck loads of machine guns for
Iraq! Is it okay to not know "about that kinda stuff"?

How is it okay for any American to not know about it?

How is it okay for every American to not think about the war every single

I agree that plays a part in it. Would a corollary be that if/when net art
shakes its money maker, it's 'back in'? Independent of the quality and
nature of the art itself?

Another factor is the relative lack of suitability of Web art to the
gallery. I rarely bother to submit work to the galleries, these days, unless
I have some connection with the people curating the show because if I don't
have any connection, the work is going to be shown poorly in a corner of the
exhibit. And probably the mouse is blind, the audio sucks, etc. A gallery
show has to deal with the gallery space, but Web art is primarily designed
for the small screen on the personal computer in the den or studio or
wherever on a common computer with an internet connection running a browser.

The net art in galleries does not tend to be Web art running in a browser
but applications that use something other than the mouse/keyboard (such as
sensors, voice recognition, yadayada) on big multiple screens that use the
gallery space and the Internet in ways that people can't experience on their
computers at home.

I guess the difference is that for me it's not q uestion of quantity, but
the overall aim of the book.

If it were only about propositions, it never would have had the impact it
did (and still does); it would have been emptied, I think, by the results
of Godel, Tarski, etc.

Well, I agree with you here; it does depend on what's meant by "the
philosophy of logical analysis" and I was thinking of something far more
formal. Brian Rotman relates to the PI in his radical conventionalism (if
that might be the correct term) as did Alexander Essenin-Volpin.

Mathematics is something else entirely in TLP, though; it reads to me like
a crystall, which in a way explains why the word 'atomic' has been used.
It's also why I think it's the end of a 19th century enterprise, and in a
very real way, the end of philosophy - which is why Badiou is both
fascinating and irritating (to be honest, I read 'in' Badiou; I find the
density overwhelming and the authoritarianism problematic.)

Could you give me the URL?

I'm always suspicious (without having read the article) about a kind of
blanket statement that's often used - Eskimo have X number of words for
snow, Balinesian has no word for art, the Hottentot couldn't count above
three, and there are numbers of language which don't distinguish, say,
between blue and green. That said, the language- or culture-in-practice
does make these distinctions; Hottentot has apparently no difficulty with
large number in situ. So one would have to look at the culture in toto
before making judgments about particular languages.

Hmm, I don't know enough about the gallery world in general to say
with any certainty. I would guess, though, from general life
experience that the art world is similar to other groups I've moved in
and that there are some that weigh the profitability factor more
heavily than others, even to the point of over-riding quality concerns
in some instances, sure, why not? This happens in all fields of human
endeavor I think. While I would wish the art world to be different, I
see no evidence in other related artistic fields to suggest its likely
to occur anywhere.

I do think there are solutions to the "what's the saleable product?"
problem. For example, Java has some very good printing support, such
that a Java application (pardon me for using examples from my own
work, but they are the most familiar to me) like the 5x5 fully
rotatable cube I made for Iowa Review (Web) could be done in a gallery
setting and connected to a high-resolution printer with archival paper
(like a Giclee print) such that a person could interact with the piece
until they found a "shot" they liked enough to buy and a print could
be made from their moment of pause.

Or the right to (getting back to scarcity) show the work first (like
Prince has done with his latest CD in the UK) could be the marketable
commodity. Firstness, debut, original from which all other copies are
made.

But, as you suggest, we want for quality of the work to be the
ultimate determining factor--regardless of saleability. The problem is
that a purely unsalable product cannot be expected to have a long-term
friend in any location where the proprietors pay rent.

Definitely legitimate concerns. I was talking to a gallery owner a few
weeks ago about how the downward trend in cost of flat panel displays
(that can hang on a wall nicely) might be making web art a lot easier
to display in a traditional gallery environment. And then there's
installations like Micheal Harold has done, and others are doing in
Europe that seem to more actively engage both the network and the
gallery space. It seems to me (and I could be wrong in this, I admit)
that other parts of the world are ahead of the US and Canada in their
gallery recognition of digital art in all its myriad manifestations.

I agree that's an accurate picture of the current state of
affairs. Some of that may be connected to a feeling that "why would I
go to a gallery to see what I can see on my computer at home?" The
galleries may figure it makes more sense to put effort/expense into
showing the work that cannot, in any reasonable fashion, be viewed
outside the gallery. Scarcity again.

But check this out. The show I have up now is a series of visual poems
I created by taking rubbings from public monuments. At the opening I
was overhearing someone "explaining" to their date how easy it was to
make them. He was telling her that it's a simple thing to "do fonts
like these" on the computer and then just type out what you want to
say. When I told them how analog the process really was they were
surprised. They'd assumed what I'd done was digital. That suggests an
openness digital work I'd not expected to find in a gallery
setting. But, I'm talking about digital here and you were talking
about web art or net art--things that actively involve the network, or
at minimum interaction.

It's my impression that installation art and interactive art are both
less prevalent than broadcast-only hanging type art in general. So, if
we consider web art and/or net art to be proper subsets of what is
already a smaller subset it's perhaps not surprising how little of it
is being shown. Or maybe the work just isn't compelling enough yet. Or
maybe there's no money in it. More likely, a complex combination of
all these and other factors.

I do believe the prospects are steadily improving, though. There are
more and better opportunities now than there were ten years ago, or
twenty years ago. And I attribute that in no small part to people like
you who have worked so hard over the years to establish its validity.

Regards,
Dan

Please come to Series A in Chicago this coming Tuesday to hear some great
readers.

July 17, 7:00-8:00 p.m.
        Eckhard Gerdes
        Jennifer Karmin with guest readers
         Kathleen Duffy, Erica Mott, Sheelah Murthy,
         Peter O'Leary, Kristin Prevallet,
         and Marvin Tate

The reading will be held at the Hyde Park Art
Center<http://www.hydeparkart.org/>(5020 S. Cornell Avenue, Chicago,
IL)

It is easy to get to the reading on public transportation by either taking
Metra or the #6 bus from the Loop.

BYOB.

For more information, see http://www.moriapoetry.com/seriesa.html or call
312-342-7337.

Eckhard Gerdes earned an MFA in writing from the School of the Art Institut=
e
of Chicago, but not before one teacher threatened to choke Eckhard to death
for producing writing that was too innovative. Eckhard's true teachers have
been the voices he heard through literature=97Brautigan, Patchen, Joyce,
Beckett, Federman, Barth, Jaffe, Burroughs, Acker, Moorcock, Calvino,
Ionesco, and the amazing Arno Schmidt to name a few=97and the voices he has
heard through other art forms, such as Clyfford Still, Picasso, Pollack,
Kraan, Captain Beefheart, Firesign Theatre, Pere Ubu, Stockhausen, Webern,
and, of course, the Doors. These are the voices of the idiosyncratic. They
will be heard long after the weak voices have faded.

He lives near Chicago with two of his sons, Ludwig and Ulysses. His oldest
son, Sterling, is away at college at Georgia Tech. Occasionally, Eckhard
publishes *The Journal of Experimental Fiction*. At times, he writes about
literature for *The Review of Contemporary Fiction, American Book Review*,
and *Electronic Book Review*. His fiction appears in various journals every
now and then. *Przewalski's Horse* and *The Million-Year Centipede* are his
fifth and sixth published novels. Two more, *Nin & Nan* and *The Unwelcome
Guest* are scheduled for fall publication by Six Gallery Press.

Jennifer Karmin is a poet, artist, and educator who has experimented with
language throughout the U.S. and Japan. She curates the Red Rover Series
with fiction writer Amina Cain and is a founding member of the public art
group Anti Gravity Surprise. Her multidisciplinary projects have been
presented at a number of festivals, artist-run spaces, community centers,
and on city streets. Jennifer teaches creative writing to immigrants at
Truman College and works as a Poet-in-Residence for the Chicago Public
Schools. Recent publications include *Bird Dog, Milk Magazine, The City
Visible: Chicago Poetry for the New Century*, and *Growing Up Girl: An
Anthology of Voices from Marginalized Spaces*.

Concerning the issue of financing, Dan, I agree with what you say and liked
the final Shirky quote you highlighted about being able to do big things
with love.

A friend of mine, Jack Saturday, addresses the abundance/scarcity issue
constantly in his work at http://theworldowesyoualiving.org . Not concerning
digital information but other types of abundances created by other
technologies. Concerning food and wealth, for instance. It does seem that
the matter of the creation of abundance is a recurring issue in the history
of many technologies. We live in a world where we create abundance of many
things people need, yet too often they are not available to those who need
them, despite the abundance. On the other hand, when they are made easily
available, the price/value often plummets to the point where the producers
can barely afford to continue production.

Presumably the poetry food chain is different. There never was much money
involved in it. So that that the supply/demand arguments are not quite
accurate concerning poetry. Yet the abundance created by the digital has its
effects in poetry and any art carried through the digital. Not so much
concerning the economics as in shaping directions of the art that deal with
cliche--through any number of strategies from radical avoidance to automated
cultivation/harvest and reprocessing. Though there is effect in the
financial 'economics' as well, such as they are. But I'm thinking more of
'economies of attention' -- I've heard that term used by several people.

God, he was a great writer in?a (seemingly) vanishing lyric tradition. What really blew my mind was the interview at the back of his Selected where you begin to realize the man has invented a private language and personal cosmology based as much on the movies as on the people he met in the flesh...the more you read on in that interview, the more you believe the man is not speaking American English at all, but some language that's rapidly?plummeting past dialect into a new language....although in most cases he seems to translate?his poems' "substrate," written in THIS language, back to American English before releasing it to the world...love the way he transposes pure ancient Greek poems into modern American settings...as in his underworld/subway poem about his mother...so beautiful...

What a great interview, Amy, and what a great name for a blog lol! The cover of your book is awesomely beautiful. It makes me want to put white-out?all over?my body right now! But I'm at work so I can't.??Sigh. Be careful, though, on rooftops with poets who don't appreciate your poetics/artistic theorizing. They can be more dangerous than a moose in rut and they usually have bigger antlers.

b
elieved.html
Although he has appeared in print since 1986, in 1991 David Baratier met th=
e
poet laureate of New York State, at which point the powers of poetry were
bestowed to him in a macabre ceremony. Shortly thereafter he became a full
time poet. Many believe his previous life is fiction. He and his fine lady
Rita, a former model, who has appeared in films such as Traffic, live in th=
e
deep south end of Columbus, Ohio, where his catty-corner neighbors ask to
mow his lawn nightly for $2. He has given featured readings at the Poetry
Project at St. Mark=B9s Church, University of Pittsburgh, DC Arts Center, and
Small Press Traffic, among others. He is the editor of Pavement Saw Press.
His poems are anthologized in American Poetry: the Next Generation (Carnegi=
e
Mellon University Press), Clockpunchers: Poetry of the American Workplace
(Partisan Press), Green Meanies (University of California Press), and Red,
White & Blues (University of Iowa Press). His poetry collections include A
Run of Letters (Poetry New York Press), The Fall Of Because (Pudding House)=
,
Estrella=B9s Prophecies I: Spinning the Wheel of Fortune (Runaway Spoon
Press), Estrella=B9s Prophecies II: An American Fortune in Paris
(Anabasis/Extant), Estrella=B9s Prophecies III: Return of the Magi (Luna
Bisonte Productions), and the epistolary and prose novel In It What=B9s in It
(Spuyten Duyvil). His forthcoming collections include after Celan (Slack
Buddha Press) and Ugly American.

Dr. Benstock is a turntable duo, in the tradition of Christian Marclay and
Philip Jeck. Using Califone and PAC turntables and records found in
Salvation Army bins, turntablists John McDonough and Paul Spencer have
created a number of structured pieces, as well as improvisations,
referencing the entire universe of recorded music. At any given Benstock
performance one may hear the Clash, Berlioz, Sid Vicious, Frank Sinatra, Ar=
t
Blakey, Charles Mingus, Charles Nelson Reilly, Palestrina, self-hypnosis
instructions, Bach, Portuguese poetry, Penderecki, and Van Halen. These
records are mixed as a collage but never haphazardly. They are combined to
make unique compositions in their own right.
=20
Dr. Benstock has been together since 1992. They have played venues such as
ABC No Rio, the Pourhouse, Tonic, the Knitting Factory, SUNY-Stony Brook,
and Collective Unconscious in the N.Y.-metropolitan area, and Caf=E9 Koko in
Greenfield, Mass.

matter editor for Boog City, and teaches English at Kingsborough Community

=20
**The Leader
http://olivejuicemusic.com/theleader.html
The Leader rock out with the dynamic grace of two sonic gymnasts (in formal
attire). Careening through a thousand time signatures and pop genres,
bassist Julie DeLano and drummer Sam Lazzara reign supreme over the low end=
,
with suspenseful rhythmic patterns beneath wickedly clever melodies and
lyrics. It would be math rock if it weren't so soulful =8A yeah.
=20
**Rachel Lipson
http://www.rachellipson.org
http://www.myspace.com/rachellipson
Rachel Lipson is a Brooklyn-based songwriter who performs her simple, hones=
t
songs on guitar, ukulele and banjo. Born near Detroit, she spent her
childhood building forts with her brother and sister in the living room,
contemplating the dangers of the dark and pizza deliverers, riding horses
and playing with friends. Rachel first picked up a guitar at age 16 and a
few years later, after having moved to New York, began crafting the songs
that would make up her first album, This Way, which she self-released the
next year.
=20
In 2003 Rachel released a 7" with Rough Trade recording artist Jeffrey
Lewis, on Holland's Nowhere Fast record label and self-released her second
album Some More Songs. She toured Europe for seven weeks with Lewis and
Herman D=FCne in the summer, including the Mofo festival in Paris in July. In
the fall, Rachel recorded a new album at Olive Juice Studios in New York fo=
r
the forthcoming release Pastures on Meccico Records, a U.K. label founded
and run by members of Cornershop. Rachel is returning to the studio to
record the first album of her side project, The Scruffles, with bandmate
Jeffrey Lewis.
=20
In the last few years, Rachel has collaborated and performed extensively
with Leah Hayes (of La Laque and Scary Mansion), Herman D=FCne, and others.
She has also played alongside Eugene Chadbourne, Kimya Dawson, Daniel
Johnston, The Mountain Goats, and Refrigerator, as well as twice performing
live on WFMU in New Jersey and on WNYC, a division of NPR.
=20
Rachel Lipson's music combines a sort of radical simplicity and honesty wit=
h
intricately woven narratives. The lyrics seem to have as much to do with
William Faulkner as they do with Woody Guthrie. The music recalls the
earliest folk traditions and yet speaks at the same time to a contemporary
minimal aesthetic. While sometimes the approach is blindingly direct and at
others masterfully oblique, the overall effect is irresistible, one of
invitingly gentle beauty and clarity. (Biography by Blue Bomber Press)

Gillian McCain is the author of two books of poetry, Tilt and Religion, and
is the co-author (with Legs McNeil) of Please Kill Me: The Uncensored Oral

=20
**Nan and the Charley Horses
http://www.olivejuicemusic.com/nan.html
http://www.myspace.com/nanturner
Vocally, she's the missing link between Kathleen Hanna and Juliana Hatfield=
,
with a wail matched only by her whisper. The Lucy Ricardo of indie rock, he=
r
zany, goof-ball spirit is cut only by the fierce sexuality of her drumming
style (see Schwervon!). Raised on the outskirts of Olympia, Nan was studyin=
g
theater when the riot grrrl movement seduced her into a life of rock =B9n'
roll. After several years with the power-pop girl band Bionic Finger, Nan
went solo with her jangly, eclectic EP Leg Out, but her one-woman act soon
morphed into the all-girl Pantsuit. After touring the U.K. with their
French-released The Path From the House to the Lawn, Pantsuit has
established itself as a virtual gland of playful melodies, moody sounds, an=
d
old-school feminist ferocity.
=20
Presently, Nan is writing songs on keys and guitar and experimenting live
with a rotating cast of musicians she has coined the One Night Stands. Her
new EP, For Champs and Losers, Version 1, is out now on Olive Juice Music.

Brooklyn. As The Passenger Pigeons (n=E9 The Sparrows), Andrew and Rachel mak=

up the cutest anti-folk duo around! Simple and lovely.

,

**The Actual Feelings
The Actual Feelings are an assemblage of egos, chopped separately and throw=
n
together to make a tasty gazpacho. Their ingredient list is elastic. For
this Fugs tribute they will most likely consist of Steve Espinola, Debby
Schwartz, Heather Hoover, Andy Gilchrist, Andrew Rohn, and Catherine
Capellero, with some cilantro, tomatoes, and peppers. The Actual Feelings
manifesto calls for the immediate release of the complete 1965 Fugs
sessions, including, but not limited to, the out-of-print recordings once
found on Virgin Fugs, Fugs Four Rounders Score, and the alternate,
primitive, Broadside LP release of The Village Fugs. The Actual Feelings
have yet to hear the song "Bull Tongue Clit" and need to at once.

Paul Cama started to play drums at 14, performing all kinds of music from

e
album Slip Behind the Molecule in 1995. Cama also is a singer-songwriter

thing that will never change is their love for the rock. Not Rock & Roll,

When I first moved to Southern California I was immediately struck by
a diffrerent attitude towards irony than I was accustomed to in the
northeast. Irony is rarely practiced by the locals, and often
misunderstood or understood only slowly. Even the mildest irony is
considered a form of extremely hostile behavior. I'm a New Yorker,
and a jew, and irony is deeply embedded in my culture. SoCal felt
more foreign to me than Mexico, where irony is alive and well.

The lack of irony can be a pretty severe disability. Essentially, it
involves being able to entertain two opposed thoughts simultaneously,
a necessary precondition for skepticism and critical distance, and
also the foreseeing of consequences. San Diegans elected one
outrageous crook after another to public office while I was there,
because there's a tendency to accept simple, sincere-seeming
assertions at face value, and candidates who mention complex issues
or solutions that require complex thought tend to be shot down. My
ex-wife, who was from North Carolina, said that it wasn't just
SoCal--that what I was complaining about is most of the US. Hence George Bush.

Here's a local example. Anglo San Diegans voted overwhelmingly for a
ballot proposition to bar the children of illegal immigrants from
receiving any state benefits, like education and health care. It
passed, but was knocked down by the courts. Aside from the obvious
social problems the proposition would have entailed, one would have
thought that the fact that anglo San Diegans live in intimate contact
with illegal immigrants would have been a factor in their votes.When
I talked to my neighbors, who had voted for the proposition, I
learned that it hadn't been. Everyone was aware that the folks who
did the gardening, cleaned the house, and took care of the children
and the elderly were illegal immigrants, but it hadn't occurred to
them that the proposition would impact their children--they hadn't
understood the irony of their position. The intention had been,
apparently, to forbid the children of an abstraction from receiving services.

But what can one expect from people who live in the desert on
sandstone cliffs and soak their lawns until the ground is so sodden
that it falls off the edge?

Optimism is a fine and necessary thing. It's also adaptive, because
without it few would propogate offspring except by accident. This may
be why it's more prevalent among those of reproductive age.

On the other hand, there are already a lot of people for the
available resources. Reproductive irony anyone?

That's an interesting lesson on irony, Mark, probably moreso for folks living in SoCal, and according to your ex-wife, anyone not living in NYC.

  And yet, I don't quite get the connection with your previous lesson on the major tragedies that was unintentionally ironic because it was based on your misreading Dan and myself saying 'skepticism should be secondary to optimism' as a call for optimism "sans skepticism" ---

  In fact, your assumption that we were calling for optimism without skepticism was fabricated and your repeating Dan's phrase for "a healthy dose of skepticism" as your own (see below) compounded the irony of providing a lesson in the world's tragedies because it was intended to persuade us from a position we never held.

Amy:

I wasn't replying directly to your assertion because I thought it
pretty obvious that I was responding to the idea of a temporal
priority for optimism over skepticism, and globalizing for the sheer
fun of it. Apparently I wasn't as easy to read as I'd thought.

When I lived i the southwest I made frequent trips to the big
reservations in northern Arizona. American Indians (many prefer to be
so designated) tend to be like New Yorkers, though more
soft-spoken--they often speak by indirection and with full irony. God
knows they've earned it.

I'm from NoCal -- autobiographical sequence: Marin County, the Gold
Country, Santa Cruz, Berkeley -- there's plenty of irony in all of those
places, and I believe I have a healthy (maybe overbaked) sense of irony.


which I find to be very uncomfortable now that I've settled in the upper
midwest, 'cause most people "don't do irony" around here -- I am
convinced that this was a factor in at least one dismissal, because my
straight-shooting, echt-Minnesotan supervisor could not understand where
I was coming from: after a year, it was curtains for me and my
"foreign-born" ironic attitude.

can't speak for SD, which has struck me as even less of a "location"
than LA, but doesn't Los Angeles have it's own rather tart glaze of
irony?=20

"not from around here"
then where are you from?=20
location. location. location.

The relationship of supply/demand to poetry is indeed very strange.  There is an enormous supply of poetry but very little demand for it.  Outside the community of poets there is almost no demand for it and inside that community, poets tend to be interested mostly in their own poetry and that of their friends only.

A friend of mine, Jack Saturday, addresses the abundance/scarcity issue
constantly in his work at http://theworldowesyoualiving.org . Not concerning
digital information but other types of abundances created by other
technologies. Concerning food and wealth, for instance. It does seem that
the matter of the creation of abundance is a recurring issue in the history
of many technologies. We live in a world where we create abundance of many
things people need, yet too often they are not available to those who need
them, despite the abundance. On the other hand, when they are made easily
available, the price/value often plummets to the point where the producers
can barely afford to continue production.

Presumably the poetry food chain is different. There never was much money
involved in it. So that that the supply/demand arguments are not quite
accurate concerning poetry. Yet the abundance created by the digital has its
effects in poetry and any art carried through the digital. Not so much
concerning the economics as in shaping directions of the art that deal with
cliche--through any number of strategies from radical avoidance to automated
cultivation/harvest and reprocessing. Though there is effect in the
financial 'economics' as well, such as they are. But I'm thinking more of
'economies of attention' -- I've heard that term used by several people.

What about all the people in SoCal who are from New York? Did they
leave irony behind? I rather tend to think there are masses of people
on both coasts who just don't do irony, whereas there are still lots
of others who do.

Jim:
          Many thanks for your excellent questions and for sending the
Shirkey and Kenny G. I wrote a response to the latter and the discussion re
them, below--but first perhaps to answer your questions.
         For persons more interested in the the discussion of the
Cults--feel free to skip this and go straight to where is written in
Caps--"Cult Discussion"

 Regarding your first question re what materials do i work with and in what
sizes do i work--

One of my little maxims for my life and work is "Necessity is the
Motherfucker of Invention".  (The Japan based Mail Art/Visual Poetry journal
KAIRAN published an essay i did with that name abt six years ago.)  Since i
live right about the poverty level on a fixed income for people with
physical disabilities that dictates the limits of materials in many
directions while making them limitless in others. (My back's been broken 3
times plus surgeries on arm and hand for nerve damage, 6 concussions, a
shooting, a stabbing, burning of large area of torso in accident, hip bone
disease growing up, being clinically dead 4 times--a "walking miracle"--they
lay it on thick so you'll feel too good to notice the bad news thay are
about to break to you right away--as to your rewards for being "a living
walking miracle"--as they figure you'll survive somehow on as little as
possible . . . what little may be left of you!---as "you always have so
far"---hence indeed necessity is a motherfucker--and indeed of invention--as
its one's survival as a person that is at stake--)
         I have no training of any kind in the arts and everything i've made
since  a kid has been from things found in the street, junkyards, walking in
the woods (i grew up in Vermont) and then sites/sights/cites of places lived
in Europe.  I'd love to make things far larger than i do--wall sized works
and movies and sound tracks i dream of awake and asleep, have continual
visions of--once in a while i will use a large board to do a mixed media
on--still much smaller than i dream of--but pretty much always just what one
can afford and carry--cheap letter size loose paper and smaller notebooks of
all sizes and types of paper.  A friend gave me some good sketchbooks of
larger sizes and one square shaped--but i use those sparingly since only
have so many.
         Except on rare occaisions use the cheapest spray paints.  Ialso use
various things for transfers, some fairly dangerous ones--high powered
solvents-- as well as the more common lighter fluid and fingernail polish
remover. The material si've worked with have been just about everything you
can think of that one finds al around one--metal, plastics, glass, wood,
stone, brick, dried mud, plants, bones, body parts, whatever it is at hand.
I've also used as "paints" and "crayons" a wide variety of things
found--fingernail polish, model car paints, housepaints, acrylics, water
colors, oil pastels, charcoal, as well as stage blood, berry juices, my own
blood, ashes, unhardened tar, all sorts of found inks and ink pads, mixtures
of paints with other substances, burnt sticks, rusty bolts, you name
it--i've found ways to incorporate the weather into pieces also--letting
rain dampen materials and surfaces and the winds dry them out, while at the
same time blasting the surfaces with an added patina and layering of dusts
and dirts.
        All kinds of things can be used for making notations in color or by
simply rubBEing into a surface--strange things one would never think of--and
used lot of things i didn't know a name for, or quite what they were--just
seemed to have possibilities. I've even used dead insects, butterflies and a
couple times rubBEings of parts of dead birds.


 How do I think of the blog presentation?  And in relation to/with the
physical object?


         I think the nice thing about a blog
http://davidbaptistechirot.blogspot.com
 is one can choose certain pieces to display in relation with one another
and hope with as minimal amount of explanation and/or commentary, persons
wil find the correspondances and interrelationships, the poetry of the
colors, forms, sounds, words if present.  In that sense, one can be making
whenever one wants small visual series-little books or chaps as it were--or
series of poems being presented in relation with the work of others and
other images from the web--fotos and video clips and so forth, music and
dialogue--  I think the use of the blog is really too little explored as a
way of creating a work in itself and have been working along those lines
hoping to find better and better ways of doing this. That's becoming
something of ever more interest to me and i plan to work much harder with,
as i think the possiblities of creating arrangements of writing and images,
sounds, even at the very basic level i have at hand, are very fascinating.
I think of my  rubBEings and paintings pieces often as a kind of movie
happening in the frame of the page--a movie, not a simgle frame..  With the
use of the frame of the blog entry one could make one's own extended forms
of movies--in some of my entries here and there this is what i have been
laying some foundations for, through presentations of series and
arrangements of works which are interrealted by assocaitions and
correspondances rather than the"direct linkings" of the more linear and
conentional kinds usualy empoyed by blogs.
      I would say that one problem with a blog presenation is that the
reproduction, though pretty good, is never really quite the colors one finds
in "natural light"--and also i think it reduces somewhat too much often the
textures in pieces, some much more than others.
       Years ago jw curry wrote that there was at a far extreme what he
called the "Quick 'n' Dirty School" of Visual Poetry which consisted of Bob
Cobbing  and myself.  The Quick 'n' Dirty i think is a way of being open
among the calls of things in a very different way of seeing, hearing,
touching, sounding, performing anything and everything as a basis for and
with "notation".  "Chaos is the score on which reality is composed," Henry
Miller wrote.  There's a kind of "dirt" and noise/sound/utterance/song in
the awareness which one hopes to be able to present and convey to others.
Since the digital filters a lot of this out by its nature, one hopes that
the works are strong enough to "come through" with still some of their
expression and presence intact even in undergoing a processing of smoothing
over and evening out of textures, colors, forms.  I find it very interesting
and a continual inpsiration and spurring on of investigation of various of
the themes that come up at the blog--"aesthetics of disappearnce",
"erasure"  (there's an entry re this which has Rauschenburg's  Erase
Dekooning Drawing along with altered fotos and the erasure and disappearance
of peoples and places--my Indian forebears is what got me interested in this
as it happens in all sorts of ways all the time the world over, and in some
areas like Gaza and Darfur now with an extremity in the intensification of
eradication)
    -Erasure, disappeaarnce, as well as a covering over or
up--camouflage--disguise--trasnlation/mistranslation/distranslation of words
and images from one medium to the next--the disparities in presenting
Quick'n' Dirty on the web are  i find a vast area for investigation and
finding correspondances with all sorts of other manifestations of these
themes.  (Walls are a big theme of mine for example--in many different ways
and relating to the Walls In Israel, Iraq and US/Mexico border.  As well as
walls in the ancient senses of use for murals and grafitti--Walls as immesne
boundary markers, obstacles to communication and understanding and
paradoxically also the sites/sights/cites for attempts to create create
communication/community, peace and understanding.)
         For example, Dan mentioned that at show he has currrently in a
gallery a young person remarked that his pieces looked like they could be
digitally made ones.   This presents an interesting situation, becuase if
the pieces are of the same visual appearance as the digital--then in a sense
instead of being "rubbings" they are erasings, for the physical rubbing
quality of them has been erased in favor of a much cleaner, more "digital
look".  The use of monuments is an interesting form of erasure also, since
monuments are the dominant, centralizing focus point of  public spaces, they
act as an eraser of the visual surroundings, especially the peripheries.
It's a centralizing State form of territorrializion, organization and
control of what is nominally designated a public space but in reality
becomes a kind of  arena for a "captive audience" held hostage by literally
a 'Display of Force"  in the "heart" (playing ever on sentiments) of the
urban or landscape.  You can't really use it agsint itself as no matter what
you do to it or its words and images, they still come out as monument-speak
and paradoxically begin to proclaim a kind of monumentality for the works
and their author.
      Seeing an anonymous monument with its same old message, one can
substitute figuratievly the artist's monument and so it becomes one to
himself.  In effect, nothing has changed in the order of the monument and
what it stands for except that a private person has found a way to profit
from its public existence.  In Revolutions, Wars and the French Commune for
example, momuments are torn down, toppled, destroyed, their dominance of the
public space gotten rid of so that the peripheries may become participant.
(And hopefully not replaced by yet another monument!) Even if a monument
remains, the attention of resistnce and subversion turns away from the
center and moves into the peripheries which are everywhere hidden in plain
site/sight/cite.


 For  your question re physical presentation of the works--


 I shared a Gallery space/show in Milwaukee about four years ago, but as
indicated in the interview with me online Kevin Thurston put up the adress
for yesterday--
http://www.angelfire.com/poetry/thepixelplus/nhdoublewide2.html
--the show featured paintings--and mixed media--and the rubBEings were
inside a large manilla envelope to take out and be looked at.
       (The interview tells a lot more abt physical presentaions and
receptions etc-- none of them in a gallery show exept pieces in much larger
goup shows now and then in Milwaukee in "alternative" spaces.)
       That one gallery  show got a very large and extremely favorable and
foto-accompanied review in the Milwaukee Journal, but since the pieces were
mounted only by large paper clips by decision of the gallery, to be in
keeping with a "Street Punk" look in their terms,  nothing was sold, though
they were really cheap.  I've been in several other group and shared shows
via Mail Art and Visual Poetry exhibitions--over three hundred in about 44
countries--the ones in the Visual Poetry shows get great reviews and all
sorts of people in al parts of the city who have seen them over the last ten
years since i work outdoors al the time love them and have a myraid takes on
them, but again, when it comes to sales i think as i can't afford any but a
very cheap matte backing, they don't look enough like "an art object" in an
official sense for people to say--i got to buy them!!!  (Even one of the
cops recently called on me liked them alot--but i'm not going to give any to
the police and be charged with trying to bribe an officer of the law.! )

 When it comes to selling them--i think if they "looked like"  something
else--if they "looked digital", or more " trained/high art-like" or
bascially more conventionally identifiable and classifiable and had higher
quality presentations which i can't afford--that might easily change, who
knows?  Or again--maybe not chnage at all.  I think that the "packaging" has
a lot to do with it.
        But if i changed things to "look like" something else--they wouldn't
be rubBEings anymore, nor david chirot david chirot, as the physicality of
them and the quick 'n' dirty are really their & my BEing.  It's a way of
being, not a way of appearances. On the other hand, i know i haven't pushed
hard much at all at this yet either, selling, galleries, promotion etc-- for
al the years of work involved--so out of necessity going to have to try
somehow to find a way--if there is one--just to be able to travel outside of
Milwaukee for a change-see my family and friends---or get some pieces of
equipment i'd like to try out--


  Are there other ways I would like to use the net and haven't been able
to--

     of course and very much and very many!!!  As indictaed, i think the
blog entry alone is wide open for invesitigation and exploration--and beyond
that i wd like to work very with many kinds of fotos, video, and sound.
Sound especially as the visual pieces are smultaneously sound scorings--and
performance/dance/event scorings--with video i'd like to try all sorts of
things to do with using found tape, and altering physically the tape
itself--use of in camera editing and of peripherl spaces and lightnings,
speeds of recording movment and time--to get a kind of "quick 'n' dirty"
quality--i've done years ago on film--to use these media in the ways which
interealte with the dirty in terms of low tech, low fi low budget--and find
one's way among these to what i know is "out there/in there"--and from there
to things unknown until found--along the way--just as al these things have
been, slowly finding differnt ways of using materials in conjunction with
thmeselves and myselves and creating what is an Other from these--an uncanny
encounter--i think there are myriads of possibilites within even the most
"junked" and "thrown out" or "used up" net media yet to be found--and as
always that's the area that interests me--what's hidden in plain
site/sight/cite--


CULT DISCUSSION

    Jim--thanks so much for the Shirkey and Kenny G--
 I appreciated the former for the historical information though the analysis
is closer to a comfortable confirmation determined ahead of time to be in
tune with current American views than an opening of some of the very real
Luddite re issues and ideas  actively practised to day--and not just by the
Unabomber--but by many different groups worldwide with differing
philosophies and practices related to this tradition.
       (John Zerzan for example has written some very intersting essays in
this regard, among many others.)
     As for Kenny G--he doesn't make much sense and when in doubt relies on
"received ideas" as though amulets of profound and infinite insight, like
men who stroke their beards to appear "thoughtful".
     Marcel Duchamp said that he wanted to disprove the "received idea"
expressed in the phrase "bete comme un peintre" (stupid like a painter). Yet
that idea persists--to this day a myriad kenny G's suppose that painters,
either terrified or liberated by the camera--fled outdoors and immediately
started painting ever more impressionistically, expressionistically,
surrealistically and abstractly and conceptually--and beyond, back into the
neo-baroque, neo-classicism and neo-dada--and into post this and that or  .
. .
        In other words, painters are stupid and curiously blind to anything
but painting, and the one thing supposedly threatening their art--the
camera.  Paradoxically it buttresses what Duchamp proposed to revolt
against--and supports the formalist traditions in American art criticism and
in poetry in the New Criticism and Language Poetry.  The painted or poetry
"object" gets treated more and more as an ahistorical phenomenon, taking
place only within the discourses of its discipline.  The issues of scarcity
and abundance, skepticism and optimism--comes down to the examples given in
the current discusion--which have to do really with, what are hte
possiblities for various media for giving the producer opportunities to
diversify her/his product line, and for the comsumer to be provided with
that greatest of all freedoms:  the freedom to choose your particular model
within the lines offered by competing producers. It's not unlike being a
laboratory rat offered an ever greater number of avenues in the labyrinth
leading ultimately to the cheese or the electric shock or the latest toxin
being tested.

      Baudelaire is the first to define Modernism, and significantly, in his
"Painter of Modern Life."
     And of great significance and insight into the differences among
painting and the dagurreotype as it is emerging is Nathaniel Hawthorne's
novel THE HOUSE OF THE SEVEN GABLES, which is the first fiction to have as
one of the main charcters a daguerroetypist, who discourses on his art and
trade--as well as containing Hawthorne's own discussions on the natures of
painting/photgrpahy and poetry/prose.  I'm not going to go into anything
from the book as itis one I recommend that people read for thesmelves and
find out about the astonishing goings on in there.  (Murat and I have
discussed this as both are big fans of this work.)
     Painters were already moved outdoors at the dawn of photograph--Courbet
was producing the first great works of Realism concurrent with the
revolution of 1848 and the Secomd French Republic of 1848-51.  Balzac was in
the last stage of his life work, and Baudelaire and Flaubert facing trials
for the realism in their works.  The ideas of Fourrier and Pourdhomme were
being put into practice--by Courbet, among others, a lifelong Anarchist and
Minister of Culture during the Commune --and the Communifest Manifesto on
the horizon.  With the seige of Paris and collapse of the Second Empire in
1870 and the founding and annihlation of the Commune in 1871--painting is
being affected by all these things--and many others--the telegraph, for
example--making "news of developments" much swifter, and the proximity of
cities and movements in the arts, media and society suddenly much closer in
time, along with the ever accelarting and more far reaching
railroads--steamships-making them much closer in spcae. Photography is but
a  small part of the events and media and social forces which are shaping
art as it moves on from Romanticism and Realism towards new ways of
understanding of what its subjects, themes, methods will be.  New types of
quicker drying pigments are invented which also helps greatly with working
more and more outdoors.  And with the widespread destruction of the Prussian
siege of 1870,, the Commune and then the huge reconstruction of Paris, there
is the creation of a much greater panorama of immediately visible bouregois
life and the life of leisurely sundays--parks--and trips to the suburbs and
nearby countryside all now a short train trip away.
     Being in the outdoors more and more and studying natural light--of
course the painter's work is going to be changing, regardless if there is
photography or not, though photography among these others also provides new
ideas and questions for use.  New colors are being introduced into the
palette along with the new pigments--the ranges of tones and plays of light
a painter can express grows broader.  Types of paper become avialable that
were not before, improvements in canvas--and, thanks to the camera, a
greater interest in the study of light in "scientific" terms--the Anarchist
Seurat and Pointillism. The incredible efforts Messonnier put into trying to
be the most exact painter ever of the movements of horses--Muybridge and his
fotos could quickly be an aide in, and show how wrong the painter and
everyone lse's eyes had been in grasping exactly what these movements are
and are made up of when presented as images.
        One of the reasons for the success of Impressionsim was tied to its
ability and interest in depiciting the "brightness" and "light air" of the
Third Republic, founded on the brutal suppression of the Commune.  (In
Bloody Week, the Government killed outright 25, 000 men, women and children,
roughly the number executed during the two years of the Terror following the
Revolution.  Marx in his writings on the Commune is among the first to note
that in the name Secuirty, the Homeland and the "terrorism" of the
"petroleuses" of the Communards--the State practises a Terror of far far
greater magnitude, brutality, extra-legality and inhumanity than the
"terrorists" it has created as the ulitmate Enemy have ever been able to
accomplish, let alone even ever have a chance to, in terms of the sheer
massivness of  force and media at their command alone.)
        In Art and the French Commune Imagining Paris after War and
Revolution Albert Boime investigates the ways in which painting,
Impressionsim especially,  was put in the service of the new Republic as a
way of eradicating all traces of the Commune from not only historical
memory, and physically in the destruction of the entire areas of its
occurrence and their rebuilding as a totally different archietecture and
populace by class, income, taste and education--but from an aesthetic point
of view within art history and in the art market also.  The "soft focus" of
Impressionism isn't due to photography, but encouraged by the countours of
new architectures, new fashions, new shops, new parks, new "days in the
country"--replacing what had been a poverty stricken area of rough, sharp
edges and dark shadows, grimy narrow streets, poorly dressed inhabitants,
dirty trades, smal windowed shops with little bright display space, and no
"local" audience of consumers such as the one that replaced it.
      Impressionism, as well as being a development in painting's history,
is a movement within the bourgoeisifcation, gentrification, of the New Paris
and New Republic.  It' s very interest in, presentation of the delight in,
the plays and impressions of light on colorful surfaces--is a form of
erasure and covering over of the wounds of the blood runnning-streets and
the annihilation of an entire class of persons within a large area of the
city.
          That kind of huge social change alone has effects far more complex
and far reaching in/on/with/for painting  than the simplistic idea that a
camera has suddenly terrified and "freed" stupid painters from their
studios, like so many rats dashing from a sinking ship.
           Photography and painting have done far more for each other than
they have done "against" each other.  There's more of a both/and  than
either/or situation than is generally acknowledged, because of al sorts of
reasons favoring "purity" and "seperation" and "privatization" and
"territory".

            Forgive all this background, but it is to give an idea how
narrow and simplistic a view it is to think of changes in "art" in terms of
the art world solely. "The basis of art is change in the UNIVERSE" (my caps)
the great Haiku poet Basho wrote.  The art world for al its amibitions and
spectacle isn't the universe--or even necessarily part of a great many of
the spheres of action and being just down the street from it . . . Changes
are happening continually all around one and its one's awareness and
partiicpation in relation with them oronly certain areas of them, which is
going to affect what happens to what one does as much if not more as
anything in the art world per se.
           "Scarcity" "abundance"--is saleperson's talk to promote the
latest manipulation of the market.  At any given time the actual amount or
quality of things can be the same--as it was last week last year ten years
ago--the scarcity or abundance is up to those in charge of the
promotion/distribution.   Need a big sale to jump start things a bit?
Suddenly "an abundance of low priced items available".  Market getting a bit
saturated and customers hungry for something new?--Let it slip out that's
there's an alert--that there is suddnely a scarcity of this precious item!!
Better invest in them while you can, for their value will only increase!!
Meanwhile the warehouse holds at al times the same number of the items  as
always, ready to be put out for display and sale as "abundant" or "scarce'
depending on the way things are going.
     Sales slumping?  Create a desire for that "retro" look--ie.e al that
dust gathering stuff in the attics of the warehouse.  Cause the public to be
seized by waves of nostalgia for your old products, kept ready for the ready
made moment.
      Scarcity is when you want to do and make things and you can't--"Almost
every desire of a poor person is a punishable offense," writes Celine as his
Ferdinand is first discovering New York City.  For one reason or another,
the access ot what you want in the way of materials, funds, a place to work
etc--let alone sleep and eat perhaps--when those things are closed
off--that's scarcity.  Not scarcity of the art objects, or the market
audience or gallery space or its converse "problem"--the super abundance of
words--
           "Necessity is the motherfucker of invention" --you walk around
dreaming and sleep dreaming of huge wall paintings, movies, soundtracks--all
impossible--but there is plenty of material all around you and a lumber
crayon and cheapest paper --well, that's going to have to be it--to realize
these and any visions that come along the way--
         The same would go for things like net
art--optimism/skepticism--just more either/or thinking traps--or just wait
until others have gone ahead and when it seems safe--come out and do
it-you'll be perfectly safe and have plenty of optimism---but there will
always be people who do their vision of art--net art--any art-- no matter
what, and have ideas coming from that necessity, inventions of interest and
use pointing towards something outside--of the same old system-- even if
only for a short while before it in turn is made part of the gargantuan
tapeworm motivated maw of the markets and promoters, classifiers, critics,
consumers--
     The net art and other new media arts and ideas are here--it isn't the
market or the medium being used that ultimately determine they're being of
interest--it's the work done by those  artists who are deeply involved with
the necessities of the medium.

            Interesting work by interesting artists/workers is what creates
ultimately, out of their own necessity the developments of media and forms
of art and poetry--the rest of what goes on is most of it production by
professionals-(it's their job, their career)--or amateurs with a gearing
towards or not the professionals--career artists, programmers, poets--who
have to keep the lines of production moving and the shelves welll stocked
with objects for sale--and jobs for everyone from the gallery's  janitor and
secretary to the in-house expert and the owner of the gallery --and from
there to the critic, the academic teaching the subject--the mass of students
learning which examples seem the best to follow--an extending series of
circles expanding --
         People will make rubBEings or net art or poems out of their
necessity to do so--whether or not they "succeed" in terms of the system of
production and consumption who knows--but either way they will not stop--and
so those art forms will continue on into the future--because given a very
powerful energy of endurance in their making--regardless of the attention or
commercial viablity involved--they are there for the long haul--not ends in
themselves but a part of the way--
       This is why i don't believe in yet another
either/or--optimism/skepticism--as being of much use--in terms of "making
art/poetry"-. For the "art/poetry lifestyle" of course they are very much
part of the ways one plays one's part, one's persona or personnae,  in the
social spectacle sphere--
       The kind of "optimism" one finds people advocating is the heady busy
kind you find in gentrifying areas where new entrepreneurialism mixes
socailly in bars and coffeehouses, galleries, cleaned up, better lit, safer
streets with tables on the sidewalks, the bubbly sounds of "a better class
of people" moving in and taking proprietorship and control of a city's
image, expressions, art/society pages.  Because the city as it was has
disappeared, and the city as it is is  in a state of reconstruction as a new
place, the new class moving in can say with confidence that though not long
time residents, they already know, love and celebrate this special (new)
place.  (Not so different than the one left behind perhaps except in terms
of scale--and sheer quantities of money, galleries, shops, business of a
"progressive" kind, and the greater variety of choices of things to buy, to
see, to do, to be had.  All for a price that is considered "worth it." )
      This kind of optimism looks for the things which mirror it--give it
back to itself, in a celebration of itself, its lifestyle, its
proprietorships and real estate, consumer goods,  its arts and poetries,
lesirue activities.    Lots of bouyant, safe art and poetry that has a kind
of ready-to-wear "newness" in its fashion sense proliferates in the scene
and voila--tasty lifestyles of the tasteful and cultured on the move.
      Towards the end of "Bloody Weeek", as the bourgeois and upper class
felt increasingly safe, celebratory and optimistic about the return of
Order, Business and Culture, their favorite restuarants and cafes put their
tables back out in the streets of Paris and their clients could be--and
were--observed sipping exotic drinks, nibbling fine  hors d'ouvres and
watching, a few meters away, the slaughter of men, women and children of the
hated, dirty Communards.
     Nothing like the erotic frisson of of dining and dating at a
fashionable establisment while the "real life drama" of mass murder goes on,
with lots of screams, gunshots, stabbings and the exciting, arousing smells
of blood and gun powder build ingto their Victorious Climax.
      Now there's some fine street theater for you, isn't there!  Too bad
they'll soon run out of people to kill and we'll have to go back to watching
mimes and mountebanks, eh?  But then--the streets will be much safer,
quieter and even a better backdrop for the boundless lifestyles; abounding.
       Skepticism in this context is usally like "cautious optimism" or
"taking a pragmatic approach"--or being "worldy wise".  I tend to be
extremely skeptical personbut it doesn't seem full bodied enough in some
ways. Not enough "robustiousness" as Bob Cobbing would say.  It might be
better to practise robustious pessimism, because that, unlike Optimism and
Skepticism,  has the greatest range of senses of humor--extending all the
way to the gallows--Gallows Humor-- which can turn oddly into a form of
joy--find the childlike "idiot real" present in the most suave and cultured
presentations. In order to survive you have to retain your sense of
disbelief--
     So much of what one sees and hears eveyday is such a complete kind of
outrage--that just goes strolling by--as proud as a peacock and ten times as
regal as the Emperor in His New Clothes--one needs a sense of the Gallows to
find the insanity at the core of it all as something truly hilarious and
horrifically true.
The Brazilian proverb says:
      "When shit is worth money, the poor will be born without assholes."
       and so indeed "necessity is the motherfucker of invention"--

Barnett Newman said that an artist writes when he needs something to read. Likewise a poet. Our aim (never achieved but often more and more so as one grows older) is to supply our own demand.

Thomas savage <tsavagebar@YAHOO.COM> wrote:  The relationship of supply/demand to poetry is indeed very strange. There is an enormous supply of poetry but very little demand for it. Outside the community of poets there is almost no demand for it and inside that community, poets tend to be interested mostly in their own poetry and that of their friends only.

Jim Andrews wrote: Concerning the issue of financing, Dan, I agree with what you say and liked
the final Shirky quote you highlighted about being able to do big things
with love.

A friend of mine, Jack Saturday, addresses the abundance/scarcity issue
constantly in his work at http://theworldowesyoualiving.org . Not concerning
digital information but other types of abundances created by other
technologies. Concerning food and wealth, for instance. It does seem that
the matter of the creation of abundance is a recurring issue in the history
of many technologies. We live in a world where we create abundance of many
things people need, yet too often they are not available to those who need
them, despite the abundance. On the other hand, when they are made easily
available, the price/value often plummets to the point where the producers
can barely afford to continue production.

Presumably the poetry food chain is different. There never was much money
involved in it. So that that the supply/demand arguments are not quite
accurate concerning poetry. Yet the abundance created by the digital has its
effects in poetry and any art carried through the digital. Not so much
concerning the economics as in shaping directions of the art that deal with
cliche--through any number of strategies from radical avoidance to automated
cultivation/harvest and reprocessing. Though there is effect in the
financial 'economics' as well, such as they are. But I'm thinking more of
'economies of attention' -- I've heard that term used by several people.

SD's anglo population is largely northern midwest, so this makes
sense. Also my observation of LA is same as yours--more given to
irony than San Francisco, even. But LA is a world unto itself. I
actually love LA, but consider that a perverse passion. SD is all too
much a place, I'm afraid.

The reason I changed the subject heading was in hopes of stimulating
this discussion, rather than continuing one about the relative merits
of skepticism and optimism about the web. We've got a fair spread
geographically among listlings. Could be informative.

George,

What's at PetCo Park?
Why does that park mean
there is no San Dieg-an irony?

Charles:

There are lots of people from the northeast (not just New York--the
irony belt stretches at least from Boston to DC) in central LA, but
they're a much smaller percentage of the population in the rest of
SoCal, whether San Bernadino, San Diego, San Luis Obispo or Santa
Barbara. The northeast  presence you and I know in San Diego is in
the academic world, an exile community there as elsewhere. I didn't
live in that world. I was usually the only person from the northeast
in any group in which I participated, including several hiking clubs,
the Sierra Club, groups with no built-in regional origin selectivity.

I'm speaking only about the anglo community. I had a lot of friends
in the Mexican community. Very different, more like the near parts of
Mexico, or for that matter NY.

In NY at any rate the folks who don't do irony are in my experience
rare--I'd guess that if they exist they're brain-damaged. It's just a
part of the culture.

Gabrielle:

I lived in France and have spent a fair amount of time in the British
Isles and Italy. I was and remain very comfortable there. Feels a lot
like New York. I think the lack of irony may be really a US regional
phenomenon (with large political and cultural consequences). The
prevalence of irony may depend upon the influence of large numbers of
people with an enduring history of loss that functions as a unifying
myth. Certainly the Irish qualify, as do most Europeans.

But it's also possible--I really don't know and would love to be
enlightened--that there's something specific to the largely Lutheran
culture of the center of the country and its diasporic community in
California, and perhaps to the Protestant south that breeds a
distaste for irony.

Australians (like the Cornish) do a good line in po-faced irony, and so are
constantly offending people, sometimes by mistake. Of course, it's all in
the inflection, and that language is generally understood, but outside the
culture it can get you into trouble. It's very Australian, for example, to
express affection through insult, although sometimes a insult can be an
insult. It's all in the delivery. There's that famous story about Don
Bradman (legendary cricketer and captain of the Australian side). When one
of the Australian team called an English captain a "bastard", the English
captain complained. Bradman went down to the changerooms with said English
captain and said to the team: "Which one of you bastards called this bastard
a bastard?"

My favourite story about Cornish humour was one my mother used to tell,
about an English gentleman who moved to Cornwall and started a vineyard. The
local farmers would hang over his fence and ask how his beans were going. He
could never persuade them that he was growing grapes, and so thought they
were very quaint and rustic; he never realised they were gently poking fun
at him.

Yes, and maybe that plays a role in why I got excited last night by
the phrase "Inherent Contempt" (a power granted congress by the
constitution, that I pray may be exercised before I press this 'send'
button)...

Or as the song puts it:
The void is luggage holds you back
but you return for one last snack
Empty fire's not so wild
demand's a parent, supply's a child
(false glamour lures you here
but you have to pass through it to get better
love will lose its looks
so tonight you want to get inside its sweater)

Or the big number of 'illegal' soldiers with Latino names  who take their
citizenship oaths in the Green Zone - except for those who get killed in
action prior to their promised ceremonial date!  That ain't ironic - that's
just tragic.

Hey, Garrison Keillor is just plain tough to work for,
but I think he's fired some non-ironic,
echt-Minnesotans, too, and even some Danes.  (Garrison
ain't all that echt anyway, even if he can name all
the counties by memory.)  Maybe you'll have better
luck if you start hanging out with some guys from the
Iron Range.  There's some guy from Hibbing who knows a
thing or two about "irony," donchya know?

perhaps various interesting images


These might be of interest; the first series contains more accurate ren-
ditions of images I put up a few years ago. The Koran is difficult to
photograph; it's small and delicate and tightly-bound. It's illuminated
with gold-leaf and from the early 19th-century and as usual we're broke;
I'm trying to auction it through Sotheby's or Christie's. I'm constantly
amazed at the physical labor and craft that went into it. I've never felt
comfortable owning it; it's a museum piece. The other three images are
half-exercise/camera-testing and playing around, but they're of interest I
think:

As any self-respecting zinester knows, harkening back to the days of
factsheet five, there is no apostrophe preceding zine, because no zinester
would ever consider a zine a partial, or little, magazine, but instead an
entity in and of itself.

Content-type: text/plain; charset="US-ASCII"

A packed upstairs City Lights Poetry Room, and a lovely, generous, tender,
witful, wizened 'go through' of the just recently out, ABOUT NOW, Collected
Poems (National Poetry Foundation), 798 pages of good paper stock, and,
delightfully unsquished typography. A book that breathes, as in the case of
Joanne, it is only right that it do so. What a satiric intelligence - aimed
as much at herself as at the beings that inhabit the local spaces where -
among much, much else - the righteous and self-important are destined to get
mirrored, turned slightly, if not fully upside down, and (usually) released
with a wit-spank.   Whether it be Spicer, Duncan, the 'boy scout beatniks',
or the world of Buddhist practice, the comedic is alive and well. "The
Dharma Committee" papers, and bulletins are probably the best and most
hilarious/counter-pomp inside account we will ever get of the 1959 North
Beach 'wars' and other associations among the Beats, Spicer, Duncan et al.

"Jack Spicer organizes Zen singing at The Place."

(Not that Spicer did not have an odd-ball humor, I suspect this is a Joanne
invention. Actually several pieces on Spicer)

"The Dharma Committee has a handshake and a sign which members cannot
divulge. If they do they have to sit in a lotus position for 25 minutes and
think about Jack Kerouac."

"It was suggested by Robert Duncan that we all write
Cock Poems for the next class.  Splendid!"

Along and among the social and personal wit - let alone the cracker-jack
quick insight & intelligence - there is a radiance and warmth here where the
person does not take herself off-puttingly serious, while the language, well
"that" is seriously and continuously at play.

And a kudu for Michael Rothenberg for being a strong editorial shoulder in
getting Joanne's work into the public eye .

And a big thank you to Joanne.

It's the big new baseball stadium down by the docks.
It is a lot like an amusement park.
It is full of volunteers who are terrifically proud and happy.
It is Southern California's orgasm.
And it is named after a canned dog food.

Hi Everybody,

Just wanted to post these two little announcements about Hex Presse
and Womb. Apologies for cross-posting.


Hex Presse : A Micro Press for Poetries by Women
the print companion to ~*~WOMB~*~ {www.wombpoetry.com}
* games * chapbooks * puzzles * poetry *
http://www.daphnomancy.etsy.com

Hex Presse, the print companion to the online journal WOMB POETRY, is
a feminist press dedicated to the publication and appreciation of
writing by women. Hex Presse publications are multi-media and
eclectic. In addition to publishing handbound limited-edition
chapbooks by contemporary poets, Hex Presse also publishes games and
visual/tactile/manipulative poetic materials. Hex Presse games and
manipulatives are often based on, sourced from, or inspired by the
work of women writers. The goal of these materials is to create
alternative ways of engaging/reading/experiencing writing by women.
Hex Presse is interested in presenting text as multi-dimensional,
plastic, playful, concrete, mutable, improvised, cooperative,
collaborative, and interactive.

New from Glossolalia:
"KATOWICE" featuring Marcus Slease
"CHANDETAN" featuring "LH Michelle" and "Microsoft Sam"

Marcus is one of my favorite poets, and his manuscript *Godzeenie*, excerpts
from which comprise the vocal portion of KATOWICE, is some of his best, most
elemental work yet. The line "the sound of a mirror filmed backwards"
terrifies me for reasons I can't even begin to describe. Needless to say,
this is a scary one.

CHANDETAN sounds innocent, even cheery, at first blush, yet has evinced
insanity-inducing qualities at the couple-minute mark. Like the proverbial
frog in the pot, you might not realize that you're irrevocably bonkers until
it's too late. Use with caution.
Download or stream them both here:

Best,
Brian

It sounded like a different kind of sex reference.

Subject:      why this probably isn't written well
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII; format=flowed

It's July 13 going on July 14 2007. Today I did absolutely nothing. I ate
some grapes and played harmonica terribly. Last night I had a panic
attack, that was a mess; I checked out the symptoms on the net and that
was good enough for me. My heartrate was only 80 but my chest was tight
and pounding. Today I found out my triglycerides are down to 220 and
cholesterol at 199 which is okay. I read two versions of the Hevajra-
tantra, Sanskrit and Chinese, in translation and answered an inquiry from
Christie's who wanted me to redo the jpegs of the Koran under 600k and
they couldn't open any of them with the URL until I sent them under 600k
as attachments. I watched too much soccer, Bolivia beaten by Brazil in
1997 Copa Americas - Brazil was playing dirty but with a final score of
3-1 no one could argue. This is already badly written. Maybe it's Copa
America. I finally understand football (soccer) offsides. Went with Azure
and a friend back to the Tibetan shop for two more tantric works. Slept on
and off all day because the panic attacked basically wrecked me; I haven't
been able to do much else. I've had these attacks rather frequently in the
past couple of weeks as I try to figure out my futureless future. The lock
broke on our inner door in the building and I traded four bags of books
for $56 as well as the Encyclopedia of New York, an Erle Stanley Gardner
novel, and yet another book on things cyberspatial. Albert Ayler was on
the radio and I heard a rumor that he was murdered back then. It would
have been his 71st birth- day. I took a photograph with my Canon and the
24mm lens - the inside of a cafe. Found out that Flatbush meant a wooded
plain in the original or something like that. I've been thinking about
intentional language but doing nothing about it. The net said, well some-
thing I read said that panic attacks can be accompanied by overwhelming
feelings of devastation and doom. I'm waiting for the arrival of a Canon
8.1 megapixel A630 camera which might bring me needed resolution over my
Sony FSC-717 which has only 5.1. The Canon doesn't have image stabiliza-
tion. I've been using the Sony with full manual, including ISO. I'm
thinking more about Thomas Ward, who wrote in 1842 under Flaccus. The
place is far too humid and I looked at a brochure of Pocono homes. I had
Turkish coffee at lunch with Azure and my friend; we talked about reincar-
nation and ontological shifts. I've wanted to do something creative, and
you might think this is it, writing through the back door, so to speak,
but it's not. This morning I had to turn Bush's voice off the radio. I
think it might be a different model name than FSC-717. I realized I like
Roxy Music and traded a book on the evolution of invertebrates into the
second-hand bookstore, as well as a book on nuthatches. I gave the cat a
long pet; we've been worried about her after her third operation. I don't
understand the excitement over Beckham; it didn't work with Pele, or
rather worked for a little while, that's all. More soldiers and some Iraqi
policemen died today; it was on the radio. I also don't understand the
Regency period. I've got to work on our dance performance stuff - Foofwa's
publicity materials arrived two days ago. The mail today brought abso-
lutely nothing. I don't understand Will Ferrell or that kind of slapstick.
I was able to write something more for Sue on cyberstuff and the wilder-
ness and answered another interview question about the music I did in the
60s. The cat's trying to drink my coffee. Feeling guilty about not working
enough on Leonardo; I'm having a hard time concentrating. I'm sad about
trading or selling off books but we're heavily in debt. My new HIP doctor
called today about the sleep clinic; she seems terrific. The old one lit-
erally disappeared. I read some more in Delacroix' journals. Coffee is
great. I kept waking up in the middle of the night; it was miserable.
There was a dream of connectors coming apart and together on the side of
something. I weigh 162 again, far too much, it's depression or stress or
lack of sleep. Soccer is my meditation savior. I'd work for a while and
then sleep and then wake up unbelievably frightened with my chest cold and
tight, my heart pounding, my arms trembling. I think this is why I did
nothing today, and my harmonica playing was awful; I'm in no shape for
doing anything. We're trying to get the cat to eat more.

It's the big new baseball stadium down by the docks.
It is a lot like an amusement park.
It is full of volunteers who are terrifically proud and happy.
It is Southern California's orgasm.
It is named after a canned dog food from China
  And only sold to US residents.

Stephen,

Thanks for the report on the Kyger reading.
Good to hear something of it.


But "a kudo" ?

conrad black, a former media magnate, was convicted today in a chicago court
of obstruction of justice and three counts of fraud.

by 1990, his companies ran over 400 newspaper titles in north america; he
was also the owner of the telegraph group in britain. black was originally
canadian but forfeited his citizenship to be in the british house of lords.

black was not prosecuted in canada. it was the usa justice system that got
him.

for all the problems with the justice system in the usa, it must be said
that rich frauds such as conrad black stand more chance of being prosecuted
in the usa than they do in canada.

JENNIFER KARMIN is a poet, artist, and educator who
has experimented with language throughout the U.S. and
Japan. She curates the Red Rover Series with fiction
writer Amina Cain and is a founding member of the
public art group Anti Gravity Surprise.  Her
multidisciplinary projects have been presented at a
number of festivals, artist-run spaces, community
centers, and on city streets.  Jennifer teaches
creative writing to immigrants at Truman College and

AAAAAAAAAAALICE is a multivoiced text that intersects
language, place, and (mis)communication with
a 1963 Japanese textbook, travels through Asia, and
Alice in Wonderland.  Mirroring Werner Heisenberg's
Uncertainty Principle, the sequence and time relations
of the poems create unlimited permutations intended
for reading, sound, and performance experiments.

KATHLEEN DUFFY's interdisciplinary artwork includes
community-based performance, writing, installation,
and the repurposing of familiar objects. She has
published internationally, often performing poetry and
teaching workshops in New York, Portland, Buffalo, and
Chicago. In 2001, Kathleen co-founded the public art
group Anti Gravity Surprise to forge alliances with
other artists, activists, community groups, and the
general public. She earns her keep as the business
manager at Links Hall and a concert production
assistant at the Old Town School of Folk Music, and
happily serves as president of the board for the Dill
Pickle Food Co-op.

ERICA MOTT is a performer, director, and deviser whose
work is particularly inspired by observation of her
immediate environment through materials,
improvisation, butoh inspired movement and
site-specific performance.  Erica has performed
locally with Synapses Arts Collective, Storybox, Blair
Thomas and Company, Redmoon Theatre, and Local
Infinities Visual Theater.  She was the artistic
director of the MUKA Project in Johannesburg (South
Africa), the founder/director of Collect4 in Exeter
(England) and is currently the administrative
coordinator at Links Hall.
http://www.ericamott.com

SHEELAH MURTHY is an artist and licensed professional
massage therapist who works with installation, video,
performance, and the cusp between these mediums.  Her
projects deal with issues of culture, representation,
global appropriation, and the power play that informs
them. Currently, she lives with her daughter, husband,
dad, and cat in Chicago while working for 5 employers
(Columbia College, the School of the Art Institute of
Chicago, Chiropractic Chicago, YMCA, Exhale Spa) all
whom influence her solo practice and collaborations
with Mrs. Rao's Growl and RATIO.

PETER O'LEARY lives in Berwyn and teaches at the
School of the Art Institute of Chicago.  His most
recent book is Depth Theology (Georgia, 2006).  He is
the literary executor for the late poet Ronald
Johnson.

George,you must be referring to my misspelling, "kudu"??  Actually I prefer
the change in the vowel to a "u:, the sound of it. "Kudo" always sounds
related to cooties or a sappy voiced radio guy vaguely congratulating
somebody for pulling off a good March of Dimes on a rainy day.

Back in reality  I should say I was really wanting to draw attention to
Michael Rothenberg's accomplishments with the Penguin series - the Meltzer,
Dorn,Whalen, Kyger, and several other Selecteds that he has managed to bring
together. It is unlikely that any other major Press would have picked them
up (such as FSG, Ecco, Wesleyan, maybe UC Press). Joanne, at least, for a
larger public, was not big on any body's radar. Michael must have had real
persuasive power, or a very good connection with a Penguin inmate, to bring
that series. (Penguin, I understand, measures sales in pounds, not by the
number titles sold!)

However, I would - if I could - owe an apology to the folks at the National
Poetry Foundation who edited the work and brought out this volume. Linda
Russo wrote the Introduction, but I do not know if she had a larger hand in
the edition, of which I suspect there must have been many folks, in order to
get these 800 pages together! But the book gives not accounting of the names
of the responsible editorial staff  editorial labor, nor the typographer or
printer. Beats me why those folks were not given public credit - I suspect
it was more sweat than bucks that paid for much of the labor here - except
for the printer.

I think we should, at least, praise all of them in their anonymous absence!

Alan Sondheim,

Are you any relation to Stephen Sondheim ?
'Glossolalia !- The Musical !'

Date:    Sat, 14 Jul 2007 01:02:15 -0400
From:    Alan Sondheim <sondheim@PANIX.COM>
Subject: why this probably isn't written well

It's July 13 going on July 14 2007. Today I did
absolutely nothing. I
 ate
some grapes and played harmonica terribly. Last night
I had a panic
attack, that was a mess; I checked out the symptoms on
the net and that
was good enough for me. My heartrate was only 80 but
my chest was tight
and pounding. Today I found out my triglycerides are
down to 220 and
cholesterol at 199 which is okay. I read two versions
of the Hevajra-
tantra, Sanskrit and Chinese, in translation and
answered an inquiry
 from
Christie's who wanted me to redo the jpegs of the
Koran under 600k and
they couldn't open any of them with the URL until I
sent them under
 600k
as attachments. I watched too much soccer, Bolivia
beaten by Brazil in
1997 Copa Americas - Brazil was playing dirty but with
a final score of
3-1 no one could argue. This is already badly written.
Maybe it's Copa
America. I finally understand football (soccer)
offsides. Went with
 Azure
and a friend back to the Tibetan shop for two more
tantric works. Slept
 on
and off all day because the panic attacked basically
wrecked me; I
 haven't
been able to do much else. I've had these attacks
rather frequently in
 the
past couple of weeks as I try to figure out my
futureless future. The
 lock
broke on our inner door in the building and I traded
four bags of books
for $56 as well as the Encyclopedia of New York, an
Erle Stanley
 Gardner
novel, and yet another book on things cyberspatial.
Albert Ayler was on
the radio and I heard a rumor that he was murdered
back then. It would
have been his 71st birth- day. I took a photograph
with my Canon and
 the
24mm lens - the inside of a cafe. Found out that
Flatbush meant a
 wooded
plain in the original or something like that. I've
been thinking about
intentional language but doing nothing about it. The
net said, well
 some-
thing I read said that panic attacks can be
accompanied by overwhelming
feelings of devastation and doom. I'm waiting for the
arrival of a
 Canon
8.1 megapixel A630 camera which might bring me needed
resolution over
 my
Sony FSC-717 which has only 5.1. The Canon doesn't
have image
 stabiliza-
tion. I've been using the Sony with full manual,
including ISO. I'm
thinking more about Thomas Ward, who wrote in 1842
under Flaccus. The
place is far too humid and I looked at a brochure of
Pocono homes. I
 had
Turkish coffee at lunch with Azure and my friend; we
talked about
 reincar-
nation and ontological shifts. I've wanted to do
something creative,
 and
you might think this is it, writing through the back
door, so to speak,
but it's not. This morning I had to turn Bush's voice
off the radio. I
think it might be a different model name than FSC-717.
I realized I
 like
Roxy Music and traded a book on the evolution of
invertebrates into the
second-hand bookstore, as well as a book on
nuthatches. I gave the cat
 a
long pet; we've been worried about her after her third
operation. I
 don't
understand the excitement over Beckham; it didn't work
with Pele, or
rather worked for a little while, that's all. More
soldiers and some
 Iraqi
policemen died today; it was on the radio. I also
don't understand the
Regency period. I've got to work on our dance
performance stuff -
 Foofwa's
publicity materials arrived two days ago. The mail
today brought abso-
lutely nothing. I don't understand Will Ferrell or
that kind of
 slapstick.
I was able to write something more for Sue on
cyberstuff and the
 wilder-
ness and answered another interview question about the
music I did in
 the
60s. The cat's trying to drink my coffee. Feeling
guilty about not
 working
enough on Leonardo; I'm having a hard time
concentrating. I'm sad about
trading or selling off books but we're heavily in
debt. My new HIP
 doctor
called today about the sleep clinic; she seems
terrific. The old one
 lit-
erally disappeared. I read some more in Delacroix'
journals. Coffee is
great. I kept waking up in the middle of the night; it
was miserable.
There was a dream of connectors coming apart and
together on the side
 of
something. I weigh 162 again, far too much, it's
depression or stress
 or
lack of sleep. Soccer is my meditation savior. I'd
work for a while and
then sleep and then wake up unbelievably frightened
with my chest cold
 and
tight, my heart pounding, my arms trembling. I think
this is why I did
nothing today, and my harmonica playing was awful; I'm
in no shape for
doing anything. We're trying to get the cat to eat
more.

Oddly enough; I'm no relation as far as I know, and this is mutual; he
doesn't seem to be a relation to me. On the other hand my great aunt Tess
told me we were related to Houdini, Ehrlich Weiss; I'm not sure it's true
but I chose to believe it - and on the other hand again, Houdini has yet
to ackknowledge it.

Alan Sondheim: Philosophy

   'How to begin philosophy, how to begin the process of philosophizing,
   an activity, a form of labor, the philosopher and the production.
   Whether the philosophy is cast asunder, whether it is interpretable,
   that is, translatable; whether it remains intrinsic to the act of
   philosophizing, therefore bound. If bound, whether it is of the
   substance or thing or continuity of its creation, or whether it is of
   some other substance, some other, cast asunder; whether the
   production is one with its production; whether the producer is one
   with the production. Here beginning without return, without recourse
   to the return, beginning in the sense of an act of writing
   designating this particular production which is named "Philosophy."'

Alan Sondheim's books include the anthology Being on Line: Net Subjectivity,
Disorders of the Real, .echo, Vel, Sophia, Orders of the Real, and The Wayward
as well as numerous other chapbooks, ebooks, and articles. His video and film
have been internationally shown. Sondheim co-moderates several pioneering email
lists, including Cybermind, Cyberculture and Wryting. Since January, 1994, he
has been working on an "Internet Text," a continuous meditation on philosophy,
psychology, language, body, and virtuality.

Sondheim's work is trans-media; his emphasis is on writing, theory, and
digital performance.

Thank you, and you're quite right. Actually, JB Bryan is given credit
for design on the copyright page, and in the list of illustrations.
The cover image is from his collection. Betsy Rose of NPF did a lot
of the  production work at NPF. Burt Hatlen got us some grant support
from the NEA. But, yes, lots of sweat-equity. I'm not naming
everybody either, but a couple of us worked very closely with Joanne
over two years or more--Ben Friedlander helping with selection and
ordering, and I going through line by line with Joanne, via e-mail
mostly. We're not exactly anonymous--we know who we are, and Joanne
knows. The last section of the book, and the title, come from the
broadside called Night Palace, #96 in my Backwoods Broadsides Chaplet
Series, still available @ $1.00. I have sets of all 100 titles @
$100., if anyone's interested.
	I urge you all to take a look at the Kyger Collected--it really is a
beautiful book, inside and out--a huge accomplishment for her, and an
honor for those of us who worked on it with her.

However, I would - if I could - owe an apology to the folks at the
National
Poetry Foundation who edited the work and brought out this volume. Linda
Russo wrote the Introduction, but I do not know if she had a larger
hand in
the edition, of which I suspect there must have been many folks, in
order to
get these 800 pages together! But the book gives not accounting of
the names
of the responsible editorial staff  editorial labor, nor the
typographer or
printer. Beats me why those folks were not given public credit - I
suspect
it was more sweat than bucks that paid for much of the labor here -
except
for the printer.

I think we should, at least, praise all of them in their anonymous
absence!

Hi there, I want to let you all know that my impressions of Art Basel
38 are on line now at FANZINE,

www.thefanzine.com

It's called "Diary of a Nobody," and it's quite long so give yourself
a little time.

The second thing is more for people who live here in San Francisco or
who happen to be visiting tomorrow (Monday the 16th),

I will be part of the local launch for FROZEN TEARS III, the latest
volume of the UK art/writing/theory journal organized by British
artist John Russell,

http://www.frozentears.co.uk/frozen_tears_3/index.html

We are having this at SF Camerawork on Monday between 5 and 7.  Doors
shut at 6 so if you are coming, come before 6 pm.  Camerawork is at
657 Mission Street, second floor, right around the corner from
SFMOMA.  I'll be reading, Donal Mosher will be showing a slide
presentation of some of his work in FTIII, and there will be a band
playing, the re-united WINDOW WINDOW.  Check it out!

Finally, this is for people who may be visiting San Francisco within
the next month or so.  At Rebecca Miller's exhibition at Hideo
Wakamatsu Tokyo (in the Mission at 563 Valencia Street at 17th), the
highlight is a beautiful portrait of me and Dodie Bellamy as we were
on our 21st anniversary earlier this month.  Miller has dressed us in
the neo hippie regalia of Kate Moss and Pete Doherty and I have never
looked better.  This show will be up through August 4 and is part of
the Mission Art Walk sponsored by San Francisco's Intersection for
the Arts.  It's great for people who like to walk around San
Francisco--like you, Stephen Vincent, and who knows, there are
probably others.

Thanks everyone,
xxxx Kevin K.

I think that you might be right. But we don't need the sound of "kudo,"
I think, because there is no such word.

You are right again. It is something to be thankful to Penguin for (and
I am not
plumping for my publisher. they have done lots of my prose but no
poetry). I was
just the other day writing something about those wonderful Penguin
books of
translated poetry back when I was a tyro. We had the Garcia Lorca,
Rilke,
Rimbaud, etc. The original poem printed on one page and a prose
translation
on the facing page. I can expect that Penguin will expect to make money
out of
their Kerouac books, but you are right--they won't out of those others.
if they
are getting some grant in aid, that implies another place to say thanks
to.

This came to me from another poet.

Passing it on in the hope/belief that all good wishes   beneficent thoughts
are effective on some level.

I performed with him once & remember his strong energy & good heart.

Hi all,

This is the only email I will send regarding this topic. Thanks in =20
advance for listening because I think this is important. Please pass =20
this on, to anyone who may be interested in this information/topic; =20
thank you.  I am in no way professionally associated with this =20
business, however, I am concerned about the "health" of Artisan Works.

They call themselves "The place where art lives" and, if you have ever =20
been there, you know they tell the truth. This warehouse-sized gallery =20
space is beyond beautiful, amazing, exciting, intriguing... but I am =20
concerned because a friend has told me they had to reduce their hours =20
and are struggling due to a lack of funding. What can you do about it?

Well, if you have never been, you should try to go... at least once! =20
Once may not be enough , to see everything on display. I see new items =20
every time I go there. It is one of my personal favorite places to go; =20
if I had the choice between  the Albright-Knox in Buffalo, Memorial =20
Art Gallery in Rochester, or Artisan Works, I would choose Artisan =20
Works. It would be a tough decision, depending on current exhibits at =20
the galleries, but AW's eclectic mix is a winner.

Artisan Works' collections range from the visually absurd, to the  =20
beautiful classics, to  really interesting original ideas in art. Some =20
are so original that I recall them individually, months after seeing =20
them last. These varying types of art hang or sit side-by-side. There =20
is "stuff" hanging/sitting/etc... everywhere! Some of the artists may =20
be in their studios while you are there. Volunteer workers may greet =20
you when you enter, and offer directions if you want to see something =20
specific. There is a Frank Lloyd Wright room which is pretty amazing. =20
I recall an indoor fountain and lots of sculpture. Rooms upstairs are =20
full of photos. A rooftop garden offers a unique "getaway" for events =20
and such; outdoor sculptures surround. Too much to note here...

I AM INSPIRED TO WRITE prolifically whenever I visit this lovely place.

I will openly acknowledge that this is not the only struggling =20
creative nonprofit business. However, their sudden struggle is a =20
surprise situation and they are a truly unique space within the city =20
of Rochester.

I've pasted below some information, as well as links to their site, if =20
you choose to consider Artisan Works. Their admission is now $12, =20
possibly due to the funding issues, but I added up the cost for a =20
family of five to visit ONCE... and it is the same price as a =20
household MEMBERSHIP! There are only three in my family, but I am =20
going to get a membership. I want to spend more time at Artisan Works, =20
and I can't do that if they can't make it.

What about you? Will you consider a membership? Students can be =20
members for $30. You can get a household membership for twice that =20
amount (two adults and all resident children 18 & under). Two-year =20
memberships are discounted even further. Let's show Artisan Works how =20
much we love their mission, and the gracious way they have filled... =20
their giant available space... with art of every kind and support for =20
every artist...

Smiles!!
Very Sincerely,

thanks for the support, Herr Petermeier -- I knew I was up shit's creek
early on in this job when I was hauled into a big auditorium and shown a
10 minute "fireside chat" given by the U of M president, where he
browbeat the willing new hires with expressions like "We must maintain
STRONG INTERNAL CONTROL" -- the scene strikes me as something worthy of
a sequel to "1984".

haven't had the pleasure of working for GK, though he has baked cookies
for my wife -- is that ironic or just weird?=20

Hey, Garrison Keillor is just plain tough to work for,
but I think he's fired some non-ironic,
echt-Minnesotans, too, and even some Danes.  (Garrison
ain't all that echt anyway, even if he can name all
the counties by memory.)  Maybe you'll have better
luck if you start hanging out with some guys from the
Iron Range.  There's some guy from Hibbing who knows a
thing or two about "irony," donchya know?

What's a poet for, George, but shadings and inventions, new constructs and
such!

By the way, an authoritative source informs me that there absolutely false
or invented in Joanne Kyger's Dharma Committee accounts. Jack Spicer did
convene an appearance of the Zen Singers on Blabber Mouth Night at The Place
on Grant Street. For further info, consult all of the DC reports in the
book.

QT: Queer Readings at Dixon Place
presents a reading by the very wonderful

ROBERT GL=DCCK + LAURIE WEEKS
Tuesday, July 17

Doors at 7 PM / Reading at 7:30
Part of HOT!: The NYC Celebration of Queer Culture
at Dixon Place: 258 Bowery, 2nd Fl, b/w Houston & Prince

I go outside and see the teeth of an iron rake extending past the edge
of the shed. Brutal teeth of the rake sharp music against the sky. I'm
covered with water, standing suddenly in the road and next to me on
its sizzling liquid surface light shimmers dimly and yellowly twists.
Raindrops swarm up from the street, illuminated in the headlights of a
car. Down the road a team of men, vague black shapes in front of a
pickup, run the chainsaw beneath a streetlamp.
--Laurie Weeks, "Robins"

To destroy an image, show it by example how delicious one's own blood
is. With pride I list the inadequacies, the toilet's vile blue water,
my laziness and envy, the woman pulling her collar over her jacket
lapel, sting of a light wind, distant corporate thrum, checkered
landscape, deviations of some river, light beginning to cluster along
its banks.
--Robert Gl=FCck, "Batlike, Wolflike"

  As some of you may know, in a work entitled "Days" I've been making an improvisational audio-photo poem ("phoetry") - like the "strips" of "Transverse," some of which are on ubu.com - each 24-hour day so far of 2007. I just recently posted a slew to get relatively caught up and so thought to post word, thus:


http://www.youtube.com/profile?user=Samtruitt

 Youtube allows for comments, and I would be pleased to read your takes. I can say these are different from "Transverse" in that I am no longer in NYC and so not walking as much and so much of these happen in a state of standing, sitting or driving (though not sleeping yet).


 Many thanks  for looking as you may.

 Sam

There are many articles on line--the easiet way to find them is to type in
search for Mahmoud Darwish--
and you will see "top news stories" for him--
i have eletronic intifada but wasn't yet in that--so check there again--
(they have very good cultural coverage, reviewers of all the arts, books,
etc)
also the Israeli papers on line if not listed among the "top news"--
it's most interesting to read the accounts in the various different
countries' papers--

Pieces on "Pieces of Air in the Epic", by Brenda Hillman: Barbara Claire Fr=
eeman, Editor.

"The generic convention of the book review is monologic; however nuanced an=
d subtle, the constraints of the form typically allow the inclusion of only=
 one perspective. This collection of short texts on the poems in Brenda Hil=
lman's Pieces of Air in the Epic intends first, to present a kind of collec=
tive 'book review,' that is, a form of writing about poems that demands a p=
lurality of individual voices; and second, to provide a forum in which poet=
s respond to and explore a particular poem." - B.C.F.

Subject:      Dmitry Prigov, RIP
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

I posted this on my blog today, in memory of Prigov:

Eugene Ostashevsky sent me an email yesterday with news of the passing of a great poet, artist, and cultural laborer, Dmitry Prigov.  One of the great innovators and tireless experimenters of his generation, Prigov's massive poetic and artistic output (he once promised to write 25,000 poems) has yet to receive full acknowledgement or readership in the United States.  As far as I know, the only full-length collection of his poems to appear in English has been <em>Fifty Drops of Blood</em>, translated by Cris Mattison and published by Ugly Duckling Presse.  In honor of his life and work, I'm posting a few Prigov poems I translated a few years back.  Tomorrow, I'll post an interview of Prigov that I did in 1996, versions of which appeared in <em>COMBO</em>.  He was electrifyingly intelligent, hilariously gesticulating, and humanely generous to me, a young American stuttering his Russian and misunderstanding the scope of his project.

Some Prigov poems:

1.

In Japan I would be Catullus
And in Rome I would be Hokusai
And in Russia I am the same guy
Who would have been
Catallus in Japan
And in Rome, Hokusai.


2.

The plumber goes into the winter yard
He looks: and the yard is already spring.
It's the same way as with him now--
He was a schoolboy, and now he's a plumber.

And the farther the more--farther is death,
And before that ripe old age
And before that, and before that,
And before that--as is now, a plumber.

3.

In the cafe of the house of Literators
Poliseman drinks beer
Drinks in his usual manner,
Not even seeing the literary workers

But they all look at him.
Around him it is light and empty
And all of their different arts
In his presence don't mean anything

He represents life,
Appearing in the form of Duty.
Life is short, but Art is long.
And in the battle Life wins

4.

Here is the Poliseman standing in place
Watching everything, remembering
Everything around and here is his pride
The ambulance dressed all in white flies up to him
Raises a fan of spring splashes
Hands entwined they're walking together
The heavens above them melt
The ground disappears in this place.


5.

It's not important the recorded milk production
Cannot be compared to the real milk production
Everything that's recorded is recorded in the heavens
And if it will come to be not in two or three days
Nevertheless it's really important when it will
And in some high sense it's already come true
And in some low sense everything will be forgotten
And it's nearly been forgotten already

The following were recorded on a Casio or other small keyboard (with built-in
rhythm and minimal bass) a few years ago; I recently found the tape and added
echo. 3 has some slow and moody 1 is furious and fast 2 is a continuation of 1
4 is fast-melodic. They're sections of a continuous 20 minute improvisation.
I'm really happy with these - not only what I was able to do on the keyboard,
but the surge of the music, tsunami. (This might have to do with an ongoing
interview I'm doing about the music I did in the 60s. I think the Casio is from
the late 90s. Apologies for the slightly large size of the mp3s but it's
necessary; there's too much going on to cut back on the bandwidth.) Then
there's buddhist immediately following (text).

Well, that's not exactly the title but for those who have the time to watch
this ... it's a very interesting  discussion about impeaching BOTH Bush &
Cheney. The people in the  discussion are Bill Moyers, John Nichols (the
Nation magazine) and  Bruce Fein (Constitutional Lawyer, academic and very
conservative -  worked for Reagan and is associated with both the Enterprise
Institute and the Heritage Foundation) .... and they ALL agree that
impeachment would be the proper course of action.

Dmitri Prigov, 66; artist and influential poet of the post-Soviet era
 From Times Wire Reports
July 17, 2007

Dmitri Prigov, 66, an avant-garde artist and poet considered one of
the most influential writers of the post-Soviet era, died Monday in a
Moscow hospital, the RIA-Novosti news agency said.

Prigov had been in intensive care since a heart attack July 7.

A prolific poet, Prigov's work has been widely published since the
late 1980s, but he was perhaps best known in the West for his live
performances, which incorporated visual and musical elements.

He and his close friend, Lev Rubenstein, were leaders of the so-
called conceptualist school, which arose in unofficial Soviet art in
the late 1960s. They were believed to have been the first in Russia
to regard performance as an art form.

Until he fell ill, Prigov was planning to return to the ideals of his
youth and participate in a performance in which he would sit in a
wardrobe as it was hauled up 22 flights of stairs at Moscow State
University and read poems all the way to the top, the Moscow Times
reported.

Oh sure. Lots of people have. You can Google PEN awards and find the

Please be advised that, all other rumors to the contrary notwithstanding, esteemed poet Sekou Sundiata is as of this writing (Tuesday morning, July 17, 2007) still fighting the latest battle for his life. Yes, he is in a hospital, he does remain in a coma and on life support, and, yes, he's still in critical condition. But he's still with us and still fighting back!

Yesterday, an eeg was performed on him and sometime today or tomorrow a cat scan will be underway.

As best as I could gather, on or about Friday, July 6th, Sekou suffered a mild heart attack, and on Sunday, July 8, he was doing well and walking about. Six days later, on the morning of Friday, July 13th, he was released from the hospital and returned home. That night, roughly after 10pm, he was hit again, this time more seriously. He was taken to Brooklyn Hospital and eventually transferred to a hospital in Westchester County, where he remains in relatively stable and critical condition.

You may contact me: Louisreyesrivera@aol.com for further updates.

Later. Louis.

Minutes ago, I spoke with a representative from Sekou Sundiata's family and the family wishes for me to let you know that, despite what has been circulating on some parts of the Internet, Sekou is "alive and maintaining."

While it is true that Sekou is very ill, he has NOT made his transition. He is alive. The family asks that your prayers and thoughts be toward his health and speedy recovery.

Please stay tuned for updates from the family via "Put On BLAST!" Feel free to forward this message in an effort to cancel any rumors you may have received.

Please be advised that, all other rumors to the contrary notwithstanding, esteemed poet Sekou Sundiata is as of this writing (Tuesday morning, July 17, 2007) still fighting the latest battle for his life. Yes, he is in a hospital, he does remain in a coma and on life support, and, yes, he's still in critical condition. But he's still with us and still fighting back!

Yesterday, an eeg was performed on him and sometime today or tomorrow a cat scan will be underway.

As best as I could gather, on or about Friday, July 6th, Sekou suffered a mild heart attack, and on Sunday, July 8, he was doing well and walking about. Six days later, on the morning of Friday, July 13th, he was released from the hospital and returned home. That night, roughly after 10pm, he was hit again, this time more seriously. He was taken to Brooklyn Hospital and eventually transferred to a hospital in Westchester County, where he remains in relatively stable and critical condition.

You may contact me: Louisreyesrivera@aol.com for further updates.

Later. Louis.

....does anyone know if Randall Potts is alive and well...he's a poet who
had a book out through O Books a few years back and published in mags like Five
Fingers Review. I saw an obit for a Randall Potts in Philly area I think it
was  dated June, 2007. Potts was in Frisco at the time of the publications I am
 speaking of....no malediction on a namesake but hope it wasn't  he...

Thanks, Kevin--

It IS long, but it is fun, too.
And isn't Basel a cute town?
I know mainly the part that isn't hilly, the other

Poet Prigov Dies=20
MOSCOW (AP) =97 Dmitry Prigov, one of the most influential poets of the
post-Soviet era, died early Monday in a Moscow hospital, the RIA-Novosti
news agency reported. He was 66.
Prigov had been in intensive care since suffering a heart attack July 7. =

He and his close friend Lev Rubenstein were leaders of the so-called
conceptualist school, which arose in unofficial Soviet art in the late
1960s. They were the first in Russia to see performance as a form of =
art.

Hi folks,

  I am creating a section for our Multicultural America course at the university that takes a comparative look at the experience of individuals from multiple ethnic and other diverse groups in the US attempting to publish their literary work.

  The course includes a service learning component.

  If you know of resources that I should be aware of, such as political analyses of  publishing history, or have suggestions for service learning opportunities (you may even know of an organization that could provide an online service learning experience?), please let me know.

  Thank you very much,

Dear Friends,

As a lot of you know, all the artists and arts organizations at the
Steinfeld Warehouse have to move out by July 31. We are having a sale
to help with our futures. This is not a "yard sale" or "moving sale"
as you might normally think of it. Rather, it is an art sale &
poetry/fine art book sale, with some definite bargains to be found,
but also with a sense that we need you to come and buy works to help
us with expenses we are encountering -- generally, the spaces to
which we are moving are two or three times more expensive than the
marvelous Steinfeld Warehouse studios.

So, if you'd like to find great paintings by Cynthia Miller, Betina
Fink, Elizabeth Criger, Laura LaFave, and Mary Theresa Dietz, amazing
handcrafted furniture  by Brian Kelly, Robert Robles & others at the
Alamo Woodworks, photography by Joseph Labate, and books from Chax
Press, please come!

As to the poetry and fine art books by Chax Press, you will encounter
savings of more than $200 on at least one handmade book, and of $100
on another, as well as a lot of $11 to $16 books on sale for $10, and
a few $8 books on sale for $5. Bargaining is encouraged on purchases
of 5 books or more.

Come to buy!  and pass the word on to serious art & poetry & book buyers!

THURSDAY JULY 19 from 4:30 to 6:30pm
SUNDAY JULY 22 from 3 to 5pm
101 W. 6th St. (west of Stone, east of Granada, at corner of 9th
Ave., with sale at 9th Ave. entry)

Thank you,

Charles Alexander

  Prigov was a monumental poet, also a fine graphic artist, whose writings before and after the end of the Soviet Union were equally wonderful.  I translated his long list poem "During me" (Pri mne) in Skanky Possum several years back -- I would recommend that as a somewhat different side from the writings Philip provides below.

  I heard Prigov read back when I lived in Moscow (it was probably 2001), a work with musical (taped) accompaniment about "the Englishwoman and the Russian revolution," a spectacular performance.

  another loss.

From: Philip Metres

Subject: Dmitry Prigov, RIP

I posted this on my blog today, in memory of Prigov:

Eugene Ostashevsky sent me an email yesterday with news of the passing of a great poet, artist, and cultural laborer, Dmitry Prigov. One of the great innovators and tireless experimenters of his generation, Prigov's massive poetic and artistic output (he once promised to write 25,000 poems) has yet to receive full acknowledgement or readership in the United States. As far as I know, the only full-length collection of his poems to appear in English has been Fifty Drops of Blood, translated by Cris Mattison and published by Ugly Duckling Presse. In honor of his life and work, I'm posting a few Prigov poems I translated a few years back. Tomorrow, I'll post an interview of Prigov that I did in 1996, versions of which appeared in COMBO. He was electrifyingly intelligent, hilariously gesticulating, and humanely generous to me, a young American stuttering his Russian and misunderstanding the scope of his project.

Some Prigov poems:

1.

In Japan I would be Catullus
And in Rome I would be Hokusai
And in Russia I am the same guy
Who would have been
Catallus in Japan
And in Rome, Hokusai.


2.

The plumber goes into the winter yard
He looks: and the yard is already spring.
It's the same way as with him now--
He was a schoolboy, and now he's a plumber.

And the farther the more--farther is death,
And before that ripe old age
And before that, and before that,
And before that--as is now, a plumber.

3.

Not even seeing the literary workers

But they all look at him.
Around him it is light and empty
And all of their different arts
In his presence don't mean anything

He represents life,
Appearing in the form of Duty.
Life is short, but Art is long.
And in the battle Life wins

4.

Here is the Poliseman standing in place
Watching everything, remembering
Everything around and here is his pride
The ambulance dressed all in white flies up to him
Raises a fan of spring splashes
Hands entwined they're walking together
The heavens above them melt
The ground disappears in this place.


5.

It's not important the recorded milk production
Cannot be compared to the real milk production
Everything that's recorded is recorded in the heavens
And if it will come to be not in two or three days
Nevertheless it's really important when it will
And in some high sense it's already come true
And in some low sense everything will be forgotten
And it's nearly been forgotten already

Many deep thanks to Igor Satanovsky for his excellent piece re Dmitry
Prigov, included in this post--

Dmitry Prigov was also interested in and created many
hyperauthorships--among them,  as  hypothetically posited by Mikhail
Epstein, being that of Araki Yasusada.

First of all, Elisa, Irwin and I are laboring hard over the second issue
of absent. It really, truly, is coming out soon. Look for a last-minute
intervention by Kent Johnson!

Secondly, I am in New York until the 23rd; I would love to make contact
with any poets in the area (I hear there are a few) who want to knock back
a few beers or, alternatively, alert me to good readings (I seem to have
come when a few series have taken Summer hiatus.) Please backchannel.

Thirdly, I am struggling to pull together enough resarch to go on the job
market in October, but did find the time today to post a new essay to
rhubarb is susan -- the defeasible pause:

All the best,

Dear Friends and Colleagues,

It is with deep sadness and the heaviest of hearts that we inform you that
Sekou Sundiata, the eloquent and much loved poet, performer, artist activist
and educator, passed away this morning July 18, 2007 at 5:47am at the age of
58 due to heart failure.

Sekou Sundiata fell ill earlier this month as he was preparing for the
European premiere of his latest epic music/theater piece, the 51st dream
state, at the Stimmen Festival in Germany. In early June he performed,
blessing the boats, at the Spoleto Festival in S.C. and delivered a keynote
presentation at the 13th Annual Pedagogy and Theatre of the Oppressed
International Conference in Minneapolis. He leaves behind a full schedule of
performances, community residencies and keynote speeches.

Mr. Sundiata's untimely passing is a profound loss not only to his family
and innumerable friends, colleagues and students but also to all of the
individuals and communities whom he touched and changed through his
performances, music, writings, public talks, interviews and conversations.

Mr. Sundiata is survived by his wife, Maurine (Kazi) Knighton, daughter
Myisha Gomez, stepdaughter Aida Riddle, grandson Amman and his mother
Virginia Myrtle Feaster, two brothers William and Ronald and lots of nieces,
nephews, aunts and uncles. Cards can be sent to Maurine at 296 Stuyvesant
Avenue, Brooklyn, New York 11221. Donations in memory of Sekou may be made
to the National Kidney Foundation at 30 E. 33rd Street, Suite 1100, New York

Our Wonderful Picture of the Month!


What happens when the image of a text becomes the archaeology of the text
itself? Let's find out in this wonderful image by Alan Sondheim. He says:
"I took this with a Canon 630 set on flash and automatic. The image is a
shelf in my local bookstore, full of works connected with "theory" and
other intellectual pursuits. But everyone knows that books like knowledge,
decay, and I thought, how can I hasten the process? I experimented with
many filters and pencil bandwidths, finally settling on an ideal transfor-
mation, in which a few of the titles like Doubt are just barely visible. I
hope to continue in this vein; the best thing about digital photography is
that no one needs to shoot your failures, and there are so many successes!
I'd advise anyone to just keep their eyes open, to shoot what they know,
and to shoot as many images as possible. You'll find that one golden one
in the mountain of dross, but it's always worth waiting for. And with
digital, you can just shoot and shoot and shoot! It costs almost nothing
to make mistakes, but takes a great deal of editing and creative energy to
find that one perfect image, the one that dreams are made of." We are sure
that Alan will continue to make these "perfect images," and we will all
enjoy them. This is a far cry from our Sunset Composition we began with,
just a few months ago! http://www.asondheim.org/thelatest.jpg

Darwish blasts Palestinian factions
http://archive.gulfnews.com/region/Middle_East/10140108.html

07/18/2007 07:08 PM | Agencies

Gaza City, Gaza Strip: The world's most recognized Palestinian poet, Mahmoud
Darwish, delivered a stinging tirade against rival Palestinian factions on
Sunday in his first public appearance in decades in the Israeli city of
Haifa.

The reading by Darwish, known as the "Palestinian national poet," came a
month after deadly battles between rival Palestinian factions Fatah and
Hamas last month in the Gaza Strip, claiming dozens of casualties.

The factions subsequently formed separate regimes. One is run by militant
Islamic Hamas in Gaza, while the moderate Fatah formed a government in the
West Bank.

Darwish, 66, who was born in a village near Haifa, described the Gaza
infighting as a "a public attempt at suicide in the streets." He spoke to a
packed auditorium in the Israeli port city. The recital was also broadcast
live over Arab satellite television.

"We became independent," Darwish said mockingly. "Gaza became independent of
the West Bank, and for one people, two countries, two prisons."

Darwish said bitterly the two governments made the possibility of creating a
Palestinian state "one of the seven wonders of the world."

Darwish also directed barbs at Israel, blaming the Jewish state for not
taking advantage of a historical chance at peace.

It was Darwish's first poetry reading in Haifa since he left the port city
in 1970 to study in the former Soviet Union.

While Haifa is city known for its coexistence among Jews and Arabs, it was a
flourishing, mostly Palestinian, town before Israel won the 1948 war that
followed its creation. Most of its original residents fled or were forced
out in 1948, and the town, nicknamed "the Bride of the Sea," looms large in
Palestinian literature.

Since 1970, Darwish only briefly returned for personal engagements.

He joined the Palestinian Liberation Organization, living in different Arab
countries. He resigned from the PLO in 1993 in protest over the interim
peace accords that the late Palestinian leader, Yasser Arafat, signed with
Israel. Darwish moved to the West Bank city of Ramallah in 1996.

His poetry has been translated into more than 20 languages, and he has won
many international prizes for his work.

NEW AT TINFISH PRESS

I.

ABOUT LOOKING initiates a new component to Tinfish, featuring writings
on art. The first installment is by Jaimey Hamilton on DRAWING TO
REMEMBER, a project by Dana Forsberg. Forsberg's work is also featured
at this site: drawings of the artist and some of her friends by a police
sketch artist. As Hamilton writes of the project: “Each portrait is more
than simply a translation from memory, but a result of the frustrating
experience of trying to translate a mental and seemingly more 'private'
image into a more 'public' one. This comes across in viewing the series
as well. We are left with the 'evidence' of each describer’s unique
perception and are drawn into comparing one portrait to the next as we
move down the row, experiencing the portraits as if they were a police
line-up, looking for the tell-tale differences in each version of the
subject.”

Hamilton's research concerns the intersection of contemporary
subjectivity, commodity culture, mass media, and the visual arts in a
global context. Hamilton is an Assistant Professor at the University of
Hawai'i at Manoa - Department of Art and Art History.

My goal  in creating the readings at Austin's Coffee and Film in Winter Park, Florida (near Orlando) was to give all types of poetry a place of expression. I didn't want it to become another coffee house/ open mic. Orlando has a growing poetry community and for central Florida that's a good thing.

Adam Byrn Tritt and Donnie Darkhorse were brave enough to be our first features.
Brave, because we have had a year of just  Open Mic


They did not disappoint!

So what makes his poetry good, then? As a poet he consulted not so much with his mortal texts, but with his heart, personal muses, and the Gods.

Yesterday, I posted my (unpublished) interview on my blog, www.behindthelinespoetry.blogspot.com with Dmitry Prigov, taken in 1996. It illuminates Prigov's project, first and foremost, but it also provides a glimpse into the landscape of Russian poetry, art, and culture from a postmodern perspective. Prigov's postmodernism was not a desiccated version of Western postmodernism; it was entirely his own, and, for this young writer, completely eye-opening and generative. On a political note, one of the prophetic moments in the interview is when he discusses how the new "other," the new enemy for Russia that would replace the "capitalist," will be "the Chechen." He says: "I think that the enemy has shifted to the Muslims--they will now be accused of being the devil."

Death seems everywhere this morning.  The wonderful Sekou Sundiata and the superb tenor Jerry Hadley whom I reviewed (my first review, actually) in the opera The Great Gatsby and who thrilled me in his unforgettable performance in Stravinsky's Rake's Progress.  At least Sundiata died by natural causes.  Hadley shot himself in the head.

Dear Friends and Colleagues,

It is with deep sadness and the heaviest of hearts that we inform you
that
Sekou Sundiata, the eloquent and much loved poet, performer, artist
activist
and educator, passed away this morning July 18, 2007 at 5:47am at the age
of
58 due to heart failure.

Sekou Sundiata fell ill earlier this month as he was preparing for the
European premiere of his latest epic music/theater piece, the 51st dream
state, at the Stimmen Festival in Germany. In early June he performed,
blessing the boats, at the Spoleto Festival in S.C. and delivered a
keynote
presentation at the 13th Annual Pedagogy and Theatre of the Oppressed
International Conference in Minneapolis. He leaves behind a full schedule
of
performances, community residencies and keynote speeches.

Mr. Sundiata's untimely passing is a profound loss not only to his family
and innumerable friends, colleagues and students but also to all of the
individuals and communities whom he touched and changed through his
performances, music, writings, public talks, interviews and
conversations.

Mr. Sundiata is survived by his wife, Maurine (Kazi) Knighton, daughter
Myisha Gomez, stepdaughter Aida Riddle, grandson Amman and his mother
Virginia Myrtle Feaster, two brothers William and Ronald and lots of
nieces,
nephews, aunts and uncles. Cards can be sent to Maurine at 296 Stuyvesant
Avenue, Brooklyn, New York 11221. Donations in memory of Sekou may be
made
to the National Kidney Foundation at 30 E. 33rd Street, Suite 1100, New
York
NY 10016. Details regarding funeral arrangements will be forthcoming.

We have attached here some additional information about Sekou Sundiata
and
his work. Please feel free to contact us for further information.

In the words of Sekou,

All of a sudden.,

excerpt from the 51st (dream) state by Sekou Sundiata:

What if we were Life
Or Liberty
Or the Pursuit of something new?
Between the rocks below
and the stars above
What if we were composed by Love?
And what if we could show
that what we dream
is deeper than what we know?
Suppose if something does not live
in the world
that we long to see
then we make it ourselves
as we want it to be
What if we are Life
Or Liberty
and the Pursuit of something new?
And suppose the beautiful answer
asks the more beautiful question,
Why don't we get our hopes up too high?
What don't we get our hopes up to high?
High!

Repeating message below: I had neglected to say that for this event
only, 10% of all sales proceeds will go to Habitat for Humanity!

Also, for those who can't be here, this weekend I will post a way for
you to participate in the Chax Press part of the sale via mailing a
check to buy items. I.e. I'll post a list of books available for $10,
books available for $5, handmade fine art books for sale at varying
prices ranging from $30 to $1,200.

Thank you!

Dear Friends,

As a lot of you know, all the artists and arts organizations at the
Steinfeld Warehouse have to move out by July 31. We are having a sale
to help with our futures. This is not a "yard sale" or "moving sale"
as you might normally think of it. Rather, it is an art sale &
poetry/fine art book sale, with some definite bargains to be found,
but also with a sense that we need you to come and buy works to help
us with expenses we are encountering -- generally, the spaces to
which we are moving are two or three times more expensive than the
marvelous Steinfeld Warehouse studios.

So, if you'd like to find great paintings by Cynthia Miller, Betina
Fink, Elizabeth Criger, Laura LaFave, and Mary Theresa Dietz, amazing
handcrafted furniture  by Brian Kelly, Robert Robles & others at the
Alamo Woodworks, photography by Joseph Labate, and books from Chax
Press, please come!

As to the poetry and fine art books by Chax Press, you will encounter
savings of more than $200 on at least one handmade book, and of $100
on another, as well as a lot of $11 to $16 books on sale for $10, and
a few $8 books on sale for $5. Bargaining is encouraged on purchases
of 5 books or more.

Come to buy!  and pass the word on to serious art & poetry & book buyers!

THURSDAY JULY 19 from 4:30 to 6:30pm
SUNDAY JULY 22 from 3 to 5pm
101 W. 6th St. (west of Stone, east of Granada, at corner of 9th
Ave., with sale at 9th Ave. entry)

Thank you,

Charles Alexander

Dear friends-

I am trying to build a primer based on American slang abbreviations, popular
acronyms, brands, and nicknames, so that I can teach my kids the alphabet in
a "relevant" way.  I've posted what I have so far on my blog:

http://belz.wordpress.com/

You'll see that I have accounted for everything but R and W, and i'm hoping
that you (being poets and poet-types) can help me fill in the blanks.  I
still have questions about Z and H, and there are a couple of other fishy
ones. I'm open to all suggestions.  I'm trying to come up with the *right*
list, as in, the most recognizable.

The rule is that each entry should be its letter followed by a
single-syllable word, with the stress on the initial letter. I'm open to
phonemes (as in "wi-fi" for Y, "Jay-Z" for J) but would prefer single
letters ("P-funk" for p).

Please help. Thanks-

Aaron

 find out how to get permission to publish images of a few pages of the=
 poem. This poem is collected in _Europe of Trusts_ published by Sun & Moon=
 Press. I know that the Sun & Moon Press is no longer in business and the=
 papers are archived in the Mandeville Collection, but it sounds like I=
 need permission from Douglas Messerli. Is this true? Does anyone know how=
 to reach him? Is it sufficient to get Howe's permission?

From www.bootstrapproductions.org . SPD also has it ( www.spdbooks.org ).
How about the chapbook Kidnap Notes, apparently put out a few years ago by

I know that the Sun & Moon Press is no longer in business and the papers are archived in the Mandeville Collection, but it sounds like I need permission from Douglas Messerli. Is this true? Does anyone know how to reach him? Is it sufficient to get Howe's permission?

I've seen numerous postings suggesting we check out people's literary blogs

but when i recently sent in a little note suggesting that folks might be
interested in checking out my blogs on lit topics I did not see it posted

I admit I may have overlooked it but I think it did not get through the
big monitor in the sky...if that's what happened well...here it is
again...

Just in case. . .

To further elaborate, on Thurs. 8/2 at ACA Galleries, in NYC, 6:00 p.m.

Pavement Saw Press from Columbus, Ohio not only will appear

but I, David Baratier, will introduce and tell stories about how I chose books by all of the readers such as Simon Perchik who will be the feature, a man who, with Paul Blackburn, created what is currently known as The Poetry Project.

  I read with him back in 2003, which was his last reading in NYC. I convinced him to evict himself from from his cave and substantially emote which is no small thing for this small press champion who has appeared in every press listed in Dustbooks _THE INTERNATIONAL GUIDE TO SMALL PRESSES AND PUBLISHERS_ last year. His previous reading in NYC was over 25 years ago in the early 1970's. Poets who have passed on, such as Charles Olson, William Bronk, Jackson MacLow,  Robert Creeley, David Ignatow, and many others as well as living poets such as James Tate, X. J. Kennedy, Naton Leslie, Donald Baker, Robert Peters and many a more star filled cast have had substantially positive things to say about him. The collection I published, _Hands Collected: The Books of Simon Perchik Poems 1949-1999, which placed his first 17 collections back in print, was nominated for the National Book Award and has went through two editions. His next collection _The Family of Man_, another massive 550
 plus page book, will appear from Pavement Saw Press in 2008. I do hope you take the time to come and see this rare event.

  Tony Gloeggler's first full length book was published by Pavement Saw Press. He is an underdog, a narrative poet who has been important enough to escape attention but go into a second edition on the strength of  the word of mouth created by this narrative collection. I would like to say that many accolades brought him to this point but no, only the strength of his poems, and course adoptions, brought him to a second edition of 1000. He has two other chaps out, one won the Pearl poetry prize.

Rachel M. Simon's first book _Theory of Orange_ rankled many and recieved negative notice as a "poet of the moment" from POETRY Magazine while receiving highest accolades from Publishers Weekly. Go Figure. This intriguing first collection is well worth the time, if it matters even Dean Young puts it in the top of his list for 2007. Check it out.

  Daniel Zimmerman's collection _Post Avant_ changed poetry. Even the idea of "Post Avant" stems from this collection which is perhaps why it has become such a staple in the realm of American poetry. With a solid backing, and forward, by Bob Creeley, this is a collection of note that has done well, again, by word of mouth. Preceeded by a collaboration with one of the most important critics of the later 20th century, John (Jack) Clarke, which was then followed by some brilliant process work from various presses and has solidified his improtance. This is his first book after 30+ years in the field.

  So yes, I will introduce them all and tell a bunch of jokes in the process. Probably a bunch of the rumors that have been handed me, it is tough to say. Boy I love jokes. And fabrications for that matter. In the past, personal experience with Brad Gooch, Ann Coulter and Sean Hannity has made the bill but who knows. If you have more poetic threads for me to consider, please backchannel, I would really hate to repeat material. It looks like I will be forced to read some of my own material but my main reading will be the next eve, so do come and see that as well as I will be offering a weak primer to spotlight them'all for this.


Be well

Work
  by Dan Boehl
  Winner of the Pavement Saw Press Chapbook Award
  Paper Trade: ISBN 978-1-886350-69-4
  28 pages, $6
  431 copies

  These poems first appeared in: LIT, Poetry East and Redivider.
  Here is a scintillating sample of our answer to "ultra-talk" poetry:


  Cube, or
  7 Complete Strangers of Widely Varying Personality Characteristics are Involuntarily Placed in an Endless Kafkaesque Maze Containing Deadly Traps

  Able to take only so much hip-hop and databases,
  I get some coffee and shoot-the-shit
  with the co-workers there. Times like this
  I think about that movie Cube.
  The best-worst movie I have ever seen,
  it’s about these people who wake up in a giant cube.
  Frantically they run around the cube’s identical rooms
  discovering each other
  and getting bloodbathed by unforeseen traps
  set by an unseen boss. It’s a test. If they work together
  they live. They fall into the regular
  character types: the soldier, the clown, the babe.
  Only the autistic guy lives.
  He actually likes the work of not getting
  bloodbathed. Tomorrow, I’ll be
  somebody's boss. But today
  I can confidently count on myself
  as someone I would like.

Dear Friends and Colleagues,

It is with deep sadness and the heaviest of hearts that we inform you
that Sekou Sundiata, the eloquent and much loved poet, performer, artist
activist and educator, passed away this morning July 18, 2007 at 5:47am at the
 age of 58 due to heart failure.

Sekou Sundiata fell ill earlier this month as he was preparing for the
European premiere of his latest epic music/theater piece, the 51st
 dream state, at the Stimmen Festival in Germany. In early June he performed,
blessing the boats, at the Spoleto Festival in S.C. and delivered a
keynote presentation at the 13th Annual Pedagogy and Theatre of the Oppressed
International Conference in Minneapolis. He leaves behind a full
 schedule of performances, community residencies and keynote speeches.

Mr. Sundiata's untimely passing is a profound loss not only to his
 family and innumerable friends, colleagues and students but also to all of the
individuals and communities whom he touched and changed through his
performances, music, writings, public talks, interviews and
conversations.

Mr. Sundiata is survived by his wife, Maurine (Kazi) Knighton, daughter
Myisha Gomez, stepdaughter Aida Riddle, grandson Amman and his mother
Virginia Myrtle Feaster, two brothers William and Ronald and lots of
nieces, nephews, aunts and uncles. Cards can be sent to Maurine at 296
 Stuyvesant Avenue, Brooklyn, New York 11221. Donations in memory of Sekou may be
made to the National Kidney Foundation at 30 E. 33rd Street, Suite 1100, New
York NY 10016. Details regarding funeral arrangements will be forthcoming.

We have attached here some additional information about Sekou Sundiata
and his work. Please feel free to contact us for further information.

In the words of Sekou,

All of a sudden.,

Tel: 646-602-9390

excerpt from the 51st (dream) state by Sekou Sundiata:

What if we were Life
Or Liberty
Or the Pursuit of something new?
Between the rocks below
and the stars above
What if we were composed by Love?
And what if we could show
that what we dream
is deeper than what we know?
Suppose if something does not live
in the world
that we long to see
then we make it ourselves
as we want it to be
What if we are Life
Or Liberty
and the Pursuit of something new?
And suppose the beautiful answer
asks the more beautiful question,
Why don't we get our hopes up too high?
What don't we get our hopes up to high?
High!


Be well

Can you use a soundfile--a hiphop group--actually a group that uses hiphop
rhythms to play with, has sampled my voice to use as an instrument in one of
their pieces. Shd they send it for another issue?

Thank you, Ruth. Very kind & unexpected.

The list is much revised and, I think, close to its final form--
http://belz.wordpress.com/

However, I still perceive needs at H (HD is OK, but...), R (R2?), and W (WB
seems to need a definite article to make it complete).   H Bomb, for
instance, is better than HD, but since F-bomb is on the list I'm hesitant
to, eh hem, pull the trigger.

Also I'm thinking of subbing U-Haul for YouTube and J Lo for Jay-Zee.

Eventually this will be published in the New Yorker with a clever blurb for
each entry, so get your opinion in while you can!  Email me at
aaron@belz.net if you have ideas.

Thanks,

Aaron

Sekou Sundiata Dies at 58; Performer of Text and Sound

By MARGALIT FOX

Sekou Sundiata, a poet and performance artist whose work explored slavery,
subjugation and the tension between personal and national identity,
especially as they inform the black experience in America, died on
Wednesday in Valhalla, N.Y. He was 58 and lived in Brooklyn.

The cause was heart failure, said his producer, Ann Rosenthal. At his
death, Mr. Sundiata was a professor in the writing program of Eugene Lang
College of New School University.

Mr. Sundiata’s art, which defied easy classification, ranged from poems
performed in the style of an oral epic to musical, dance and dramatic
works infused with jazz, blues, funk and Afro-Caribbean rhythms. In
general, as he once said in a television interview, it entailed “the whole
idea of text and noise, cadences and pauses.”

His work was performed widely throughout the United States and abroad,
staged by distinguished organizations like the Brooklyn Academy of Music
and the Spoleto Festival U.S.A. Among Mr. Sundiata’s most recent works was
“the 51st (dream) state,” an interlaced tapestry of poetry, music, dance
and videotaped interviews that explores what it means to be an American in
the wake of 9/11.

His other works include “Udu,” a staged oratorio about slavery in
present-day Mauritania, with music by Craig Harris; “blessing the boats,”
a one-man show, autobiographically inspired, about Mr. Sundiata’s
experiences of heroin addiction, a debilitating car crash and a kidney
transplant; and “The Circle Unbroken Is a Hard Bop,” a collaboration with
Mr. Harris about black Americans coming of age in the 1960s.

Writing in The New York Times in 1993, D .J. R. Bruckner reviewed a
production of “The Circle Unbroken” at the Nuyorican Poets Cafe:

“This is a remarkably smooth work, its complex stories and ideas bound
together by the vivid, memorable poetry of Mr. Sundiata. And in one
tornadic scene, the poet lets the audience hear all at once the range of
his vocabulary and voice: Mr. Sundiata becomes a young, crazed homeless
man on the street, and in eight minutes pours out a torrent of grief,
humor and shrewd insight that leaves one simply astonished.”

Mr. Sundiata was born Robert Franklin Feaster in Harlem on Aug. 22, 1948;
he adopted the African name Sekou Sundiata in the late 1960s. He earned a
bachelor’s degree in English from City College of New York in 1972 and a
master’s degree in creative writing from the City University of New York
in 1979.

He is survived by his wife, Maurine Knighton, known as Kazi; a daughter,
Myisha Gomez of Manhattan; a stepdaughter, Aida Riddle of Brooklyn; his
mother, Virginia Myrtle Singleton Feaster of Kingstree, S.C.; two
brothers, William Feaster of Belleville, N.J., and Ronald Feaster of
Manhattan; and one grandchild.

Mr. Sundiata, who performed with the folk rock artist Ani DiFranco as part
of her Rhythm and News tour in 2001, released several CDs of music and
poetry, including “The Blue Oneness of Dreams” (Mouth Almighty/Mercury
Records) and “longstoryshort” (Righteous Babe Records). His work was also
featured on television, on the HBO series “Def Poetry” and the PBS series
“The Language of Life.”

George Bush is scheduled for a routine colonoscopy, according to his

Cheney will declare war on the world.

You heard it here first.

This is the view from my desk which is neither in Paris nor the Black
Forest; it faces nothing but bleak development, projects, urban wasteland
scheduled for drastic over-development, still opposed by Develop Don't
Destroy Brooklyn (DDDB) in what is increasingly appearing to be a losing
battle. How can one expect literature from such blight, nature pushed out
to the limit, pigeons with missing toes resulting from frostbite, squir-
rels huddled in backyards along with jays and almost invisible mourning
doves? Everything protects itself; humans are the dominant species and
everything, including other humans, is prey.

So don't can't expect literature, only theory crippled by screams and auto
accidents; you can't expect proper grammar and spelling - those literary
matters - in the face of screeching cars and sirens.

I just talked with CJ Laity who runs Chicagopoetry.com and wrote the
article.  He was there.  This really happened, around 10:30 Friday night.
The event was scheduled to go on for several more hours.

We can only hope the Poetry Foundation will raise a stink about it

Subject:      Uselessness of Monoculture
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII; format=flowed

Uselessness of Monoculture


I will call 'monoculture' anything before the advent of the Internet - in
particular artworks, literature, theater, dance, etc. etc. This culture is
characterized by the singular; even when dispersive anatomies are present,
they are always in opposition or subtext to traditional thought. The mono-
lith is always present and accounted-for. The monolith is either station-
ary or process- movement- oriented, always static or dynamic; its elements
cohere, separate, are born to die, to be reborn again. This is the culture
of the traditional university but it is also urban culture, street-corner
culture; it is the culture of history and historiography, of the encyclo-
pedia and the expert and think-tank. Monoculture resolves, whether towards
resolution or irresolution; it is possessed by narratological impulse, by
development and the compass. Monoculture is not necessarily unary; there
is multiplicity and the nomadic, beneath the stars, within it. Monoculture
blinds us to the world; it is the World that is all the case. It is the
culture of gas, liquid, solid, electrostatics, electrodynamics, special
and general relativity; it is the substance of quantum mechanics insofar
as action may be defined as action or verification at a distance. In sum,
it is our sum, our summation, our accountancy of the world and of our-
selves, and it is useless, as the result of an Internet that is neither
singular nor plural, neither present nor absent, neither coherent nor dis-
persed; I will call 'Internet' what has corrupted monoculture, tended
towards its demise. I am not implying that 'Internet' in fact or fiction
signifies anything, that the name means; it may, in fact or fiction, be
characterized imprecisely by insigification, spews, abjections, blurs,
avatars, nothing at all.

For the change that has come about within and without the tangled skein,
holarchy of networkings, is of the plasma or swarm; it is Wolfram's
science, not Hertz's. Thinking through social sites, collaborative facting
and fictioning, wikipediatry, avatars of avatars, bots and phishing, what
comes clear is lack of clarity, lack of clarity's epistemology. This is a
fundamental transform to the extent that anything is fundamental at this
point; it sweeps away, for example, plots and allegories, bureaucracies
and governments, minds and bodies. Think of pre-Internet novels - novels
of modernism or post-modernism, of constructed and conceptual weavings, of
characters or lack of them. And television, theater, cinema, follow suit;
one is locked into farther time, father time, to diegesis, to an unravel-
ing that characterizes experimental film as well. Neither film nor paint-
ing are linear, but both participate in a locking-down of perspective, no
matter what openings, contusions, are on the horizon.

Lacan, Gardner, even Bateson presaged multiplicities; in Wolfram the swarm
is simultaneously organized and disorganized. Lacan never went far enough;
there was that reliance on language, no matter how shifted. It comes down
to this: When I read a novel, I don't recognize myself, the 'times,' any-
thing. When I watch a show on television, there are actors, people, or
animated actors. They're moving through familiar antiquated monolithic
space, proscenium or deep space - it makes no difference; there's always a
perspective. Perspective invades novels, stories, the world of monolithic
writing - on the other hand, try assigning a vanishing-point to MySpace or
even Facebook. Even Second Life, which tends towards classical perspec-
tive, falls apart on the edges where the simulacrum of physics is turned,
churned upside-down. One doesn't recognize (oneself or others) in Second
Life because recognition is already a problem; everything moves within the
aegis of Bell's theorem.

Consider photographic apparatus: begin with camera obscura, that one-to-
one allegory of the real - through Daguerre, view cameras, stationary then
moving then Edgerton. Cameras dissolve into swarming components; now com-
ponents themselves disappear as cameras transform into light-sensitive
holarchies, networked or independent, under whose or what control? The
image ends up everywhere and nowhere at all; no longer is it allegory -
which has long since disappeared - but the stuttering of the fragment
which no longer is in need of suture or extension. You can watch family
trauma, physical and mental abuse, on the morning talk shows, but whose
families? whose abuse? whose perspective? It doesn't need to end up on
YouTube; YouTube provides its own violence, its own parameters of liter-
ally unfathomable streams. Videos are removed if found, if from copy-
righted material; everything gets through, leaks. But leaks from nothing -
the culture, non-monolithic, Internetted, leaks without transmitters,
receivers, leaks without channels, or leaks from traditional channels,
only to be churned back, lost in brackish protocol.

Code, programs, codes, protocols, reference one another, are increasingly
open-sourceless; scratch the surface and no one's there, nor beneath the
surface - all those dead-ending projects on SourceForge ending up maybe
somewhere else, maybe vaporware, the languor of the name. Languages embed
languages; soon they'll be without physical foundation for all intents and
purposes, perfectly floating signifiers shattering against subroutines and
useful or useless misuses. (The world doesn't end either with a bang or
with a whimper; there is no world to end.)

This confusion is on the ground as well - in some places, Harry Potter
really is a witch; children suffer as a result. It doesn't take electron-
ics; it takes nothing more than extinctions, overpopulation, global cli-
mate change, weapon distribution, religious fanaticisms, starvation,
desertification - the unsupportive world. Radiations swirl around the
farthest villages; there are unheard broadcasts, music, news, exhortations
to the perfect religious life, promises of vacated paradises. These places
or spaces are the future of the novel; language dissolves without signifi-
ers, without that place where the sememe holds, however tenuously. It's
here that home is found, in the bombing of the home, categorization of
flora and fauna, ethnic cleansing. Online real explosions transform into
hacking, thousands, millions, of MySpace friends, hundreds of millions of
blogs, billions of Wikipedia pages hardly ever under contestation. Yes,
it's all true. Yes, none of it is.

Monolithic culture prepared the battlefield inhabited only by the wounded.
Monolithic culture developed the technology of multiplicity and the plasma
- a multiplicity of multiplicities, never stationary enough for analysis,
never moving enough for a coherent dynamics to emerge. It's a memory to an
extent, to the extent that memory is encapsulated in fast-forward media
already forgetting what was loosened in the habitus.

This is all electronic, all colonial, all nanobot, this isn't your fath-
er's monoculture, your mother's multiplicity, your father's multiplicity,
your mother's monoculture. Capital seeps everywhere as do heat and water;
island nations are disappearing in the Pacific, Atlantic not far behind.
Think of this as the anxiety of diminishing power; surely, not only is the
world out of control, but control is as well. What happens to feedback in
chaotic domains? One likes to think fecundity, fractal, but in the real this
holds only so long before 'things' bottom out in rust and tumors.
Monoculture is always waiting in the wings; as networks decay and data-
bases turn useless, big iron will descend upon the world. But this is far in
the future, a future so defined that no one will see it, no one will inhabit
it. Instead of now, we are pre-sent, always in a state of arrival; there are
endless tracks, monorails, they go nowhere, sink in dust, desiccation.

This is all electronic, and as technology miniaturizes, improves, perhaps
these skeins will continue, sheathed, to exist, transmit, transform, no
matter what. Then the scenario simply holds longer. Consider: There are no
species. There is no real life, no organic life, no artificial life, no
patented life, no constructed life. There is network life and one hopes
that the remnants of wilderness (which are not to be deconstructed) remain
that way, that enclaves succeed where management hasn't. Consider: There
are no persons; there are couplings, situations which grow increasingly
small and temporary, imminent decisions. Consider: Immanence has disap-
peared, if it were every anything more than mythos; it's replaced by the
Facebook contact, as enunciations are replaced and replicated by 'What I
am doing now.' Consider the usual: We are all audience; none of us are
watching; we are all watching; there is no 'we.' It's the latter Lacan has
missed; there is nothing to talk about. These essays themselves are thin
sheaves, interspersions; they carry the dim light of the dusk into the
dusk. 'Beyond' means absolutely nothing; time is indicated only by the
stoppage of death. What is a store if not a mouse-click or twitch? What is
a body if not blown to pieces by a car-bomb? On a certain undefined level,
these are identical. Perhaps an economic level. Perhaps in the poetics of
disappearance.

To be in pain, slaughtered, wounded, is two-fold, interior, exterior. The
former stops everything; it is unthinkable, unbearable. It is always other
even when ourselves. The color of time disappears without witness. But
exterior - this requires transmission, a receiver, political economy, some
means of noise control. The receiver must be receptive, must orient itself
towards the message; otherwise the message remains noise, death. The
receiver must have space place for reception, a moment off the network
which in the very real, idiotic inert real, may be what has brought her to
this moment. But the receiver is already dissolving and a hundred-thousand
new novels are being born, and they are not novels, nor histories, but
software biographies perhaps. Rather than monoculture, monolith, let us
say multlathe, uncontrolled or multiply-controlled lathes refashioning,
refiguring, configuring, what we are reading that was once literature.
There is great exhilaration, great promise; multilathing, in its bypassing
any and all absolutes, is always in process of permanent deconstruction.
Think of the school essay, modified, bought, sold, dated, outdated, online
and offline, assembled, reassembled, spell-checked, recreated, plagiar-
ized, written on demand, printed on demand, behind wikipediatry, related
to class, gender, sex, race, nation, religion, handedness, all or none.
Think of the essay reader, the recipient, following through with programs
designed to weed out the copy which is always already a copy, hacking his
way through the sememe looking for miscreants, passing results to and from
university and institutional databases, listening softly to the YouTube
song, exchange of draft letter on Gmail, or just listening to Ipod Itunes
with her Ii. The whole world is steganographic, embedded, uninterpretable,
piecemeal, exchanged.

So for better or worse monoculture is dead; it grew on foreign soil, is in the
process of recession. To what? To the corners of vulnerable data-bases and
technologies, conservationists, those disappearing from the present. The future
were there, pre-sent, and it's why novels and paintings and just about anything
before 1985, say - _not_ 1968 - is inconceivably quaint, something for school
credit, nothing more. We need an ethnography of our own pasts presented as
disappearing cultures or archaeologies written in the unreadable, spoken in the
unspeakable; it is here that our bodies once reproduced and never reproduced in
the continuing acceleration of images - of someone or other or no one at all.

(I'm not good enough; I'm not smart enough: You may think this is tempora- ry
or not-me, not-I, that this is elsewhere, of an other, an other genera- tion,
place space, time, time before death. This is not the bicylist who was injured
on the corner of Fifth and Bergen three days ago, but this is her/our interior,
her/our political economy, what comes about in the midst of architecture and
physics. I want to talk about the pleasure of novel- reading, Harry Potter and
other accelerants, and their fan- and enclave- existence. I want to talk about
radiations and dusts and their dispersions and what they carry from prions to
nanogarbage to pollutions to sex to early deaths from bullets and asthma. I
want to talk about mash, I want to perform djay vjay Vday vdday. I want to be
you or someone. Rimbaud knew he was splitting up. The last of the obscene has
passed, the obscene is al- ways passing: the ob-hack fractured and visible. The
last of the discourse too.)

Yeah, I was there too... I heard the reason the cops shut it down was there
were people selling booze on different floors, and they didn't have a liquor
license. The Zhou B. Center (www.zhoub.com) has their own bar / cafe where
they sell alcohol, so Zhou B. must have their own license. The question is
whether the people selling beer etc. on the 2nd & 3rd floors had a license.
It's one thing if you go to an event like a gallery opening and they've got
the free wine & cheese, but you need the license if you want to sell it...

Maybe cops have two mandates: keep up public safety, and generate revenue
for their employer (in this case the City of Chicago). I don't think a bunch
of poetry & zine aficionados who are having a good time, celebrating
literature, and who may be blotto or sober or somewhere in between are a
threat to public safety. But illegally selling booze gives cops an
opportunity to bust a place, and then the city slaps the venue with a fine.
The cops get patted on the backs from the lieutenant or whoever.

If the problem was they didn't have the proper liquor license, I wonder
whose fault it is: Zhou B. Center or the Poetry Foundation. If this was the
problem, personally I blame the Poetry Foundation because they might have
been the event's biggest sponsor. They should've known better. They
should've understood the public codes for that, and they should've been
overseeing the event.

I don't think John Barr, the Poetry Foundation's President, was there. Some
of you may have read this article that came out in The New Yorker earlier
this year:
http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2007/02/19/070219fa_fact_goodyear. Ruth
Lilly was the one who gave the Poetry Foundation $200 million several years
ago. The Eli Lilly & Co. make Prozac; maybe Eli Lilly & Co. reps could've
been there on Friday to give the cops Prozac so they could've just chilled
out.

Did the cops bust the event because the Printer's Ball was disrupting the
public? I didn't see any of that. I did see some dudes in their underwear
and goggles playing electronic music, but that's not like Jim Morrison in
Miami in 1969 when he allegedly pulled his pants down.

It was amazing to see how many people and literary organizations worked
together to make the event happen. Also, there was an impressive list of
Printer's Ball Readings that have happened over the past month, leading up
to last Friday's event at the Zhou B. Center. I'm looking forward to next
year's Printer's Ball.

I just talked with CJ Laity who runs Chicagopoetry.com and wrote the

The event was scheduled to go on for several more hours.

We can only hope the Poetry Foundation will raise a stink about it

This e-mail is for CA Conrad.

I woke up this morning thinking of Merle Hoyleman.

Went to Google.

Other than Jonathan Williams, your listserve note makes me think I am one of the very few living who
knew Merle face to face. Can this be?

I published Asp of the Age, printed it in Toronto.

I expect your issue of the magazine regarding Merle has been published by now and I'd be interested
to see it. It is unlikely that I'll be able to offer anything for publication because despite visits in
Pittsburgh, this morning I don't have much memory of things discussed. But the interest is there.

Must be something in the air. I've just published a little book called GEORGE ORWELL'S FRIEND:
Selected Writing by Paul Potts. A reworking of my introduction is in arcpoetry magazine--the latest
issue, devoted to "shamefully neglected or forgotten Canadian poets."  www.arcpoetry.ca

As it happens, Jonathan Williams is one of the few people to write something about Potts in the last
several years. But then again, Jonathan often focused on the neglected and forgotten long before the
rest of us knew that they existed. Anthony Carroll wrote a memoir fairly recently in (I think) London
Review.

And thinking of the N & F, I realize that another poet I published who should not be forgotten is
Pittsburgh's Haniel Long (born in Rangoon to missionary parents, died in Santa Fe).

In any case, please let me know this has been received and how your search for Merle turned out. If
there are specific questions, I don't mind digging back, if I can help.

NOTE: Merle self-published an edition of 25 signed and numbered copies of LETTERS TO
CHRISTOPHER in 1970.

Witih good wishes,

Ronald Caplan


THEN I FOUND THIS, which speaks to the above:

this is an idea i had about a year ago for a magazine celebrating obscure poets i'd like more folks to
know about, but it kind of went nowhere with the first issue. the first poet was supposed to be a
feature of Merle Hoyleman. she's really amazing, and maybe i'll share some of her poems on the Philly
Sound blog, but it's impossible to use her for the WHATEVER HAPPENED TO THE POET? magazine,
mainly because everyone who knew her is already dead, and there's not even anyone out there who
has read her poems, it seems. James Laughlin knew the most about her. Jonathan Williams knew her,
but doesn't have too much to share, except that she would call him in the middle of baseball games
and talk about the "Scum," her paranoid collective she seemed to focus on a lot. New Directions gave
me permission to reprint her Christopher Letters Poems and maybe that's what i'll do, here on the
blog, soon. they're really brilliant, lost treasures.

Hey People!
For those of you on the list who haven't checked out my compilation of
classics from the archives of the legendary Trojan Records, one of my
favorite magazines, Wired, did a great overview of my Trojan Project -
after all, it's the record label's 40th Anniversary! For Jamaican music 40
years is a really really really long time! Imagine Def Jam in 40 years...
Hard to think about, eh? The mix that I did was part of a series Trojan
Records has set up. They asked Johhny Greenwood, the guitarist for
Radiohead, and Fatboy Slim to also do selections and remixes. Look out for
that too!

Anyway, I wanted to let you all know about a couple of things: The Wired
Magazine feature is really solid, and it even has a slideshow of classic
old school album covers.

On the same tip I remixed a classic Bob Marley track "Rainbow Country" for
the upcoming "Roots, Rock, Remixed" compilation that the Marley family
commissioned for their record label "Tuff Gong." I just wanted to let the
list know - it's on a downtempo party tip, but hey... It's perfect for
summer. The album will be out in a bit. All I can say is you heard it here
first! Check it!!!

------------------------------

And last but not least, for the www.myspace.com/djspooky community, I
wanted to let everyone know about a great festival of digital media coming
up. It's called Indian Electronic Music Festival, and me and and the
legendary Talvin Singh are doing a track for the compilation that
accompanies the festival. You can preview the track at
http://www.myspace.com/djspooky. It's called "Satyagraha" after Mahatma
Ghandi's philosophy of non violent resistance to all forms of oppression.
We're going to do a remix contest to help raise awareness about the
festival - more on that in a bit. This summer, my main focus has been my
art projects, and I'm not really dj'ing that much at the moment 'cause I'm
in the studio working on my next album. During the interim, check out the
Wired Magazine article!

I'm just writing from my studio to say what's up, and to wish y'all a happy
Summer. President Bush is still up to his bullsh*t, the war ON Iraq is
still going on, and the world is heating on up. But hey... Music helps
bring awareness of it all.

aiightt!

in peace,

[Please forward this on to interested parties, post on blogs,
etc....small presses survive on word of mouth!]

Dear Friends,

Atticus/Finch is honored to announce the release of its tenth
chapbook, Patrick F. Durgin’s _Imitation Poems_. For most, Durgin’s
name will need little introduction: as editor of Kenning for nearly a
decade, he’s played an inestimable role in the cultural production of
some fantastically important work, and, as a poet, Durgin writes some
seriously taut and careful little numbers. I’ve admired his work for
years, and when a Durgin volume did not materialize in said years, I
decided to make one myself. When you see it, I’m certain you’ll be
glad I did! These poems promise to knock you back into your chair and
then onto the ground, and then they promise to roll you around and
around on the ground until you’re dizzy and exhausted and just want to
go to bed.

And to commemorate this, our tenth-book-anniversary, we’ve finally
added Pay Pal to the website! Stop by (www.atticusfinch.org) to view
an image of the cover and read some sample poems, and then buy
Imitation Poems for eight dollars (!) with the click of a button! And
if you’ve been meaning to purchase a copy of John Taggart’s
_Unveiling/Marianne Moore_, you should buy that too before the handful
of copies in existence disappears with the click of a Pay Pal.

OR, if you prefer to do it the old fashioned way, write me a note, cut
a check for eight bucks (made payable to Michael Cross) and mail it
here:

Atticus/Finch Chapbooks
c/o Michael Cross
State University of New York at Buffalo
Samuel Clemens Hall #306

And finally, just in case your curious, forthcoming from Atticus/Finch:

Taylor Brady and Rob Halpern, _Snow Sensitive Skin_ (Fall 2007)
C.J. Martin, _Lo, Bittern_ (Winter 2007-2008)

Content-Type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII; delsp=yes; format=flowed

Hello People!

I just joined the list and wanted to let you all know about a new
media haiku poetry project I have been working on since 2005.

'Haiku Trader' is a new media poetry / performance artwork that began
in 2005. The art work as such utilises the social network myspace as
a virtual collaborative space investigating the theme of distributed
creativity and aesthetics. Practically speaking, what this means is
that the work is not 'limited' to this profile but must be
conceptualised as the network it involves progressively over time.
This network can be explored through the virtual traces left as haiku
'comments' throughout the myspace community.

Haiku Trader is accessible at this url:

http://www.myspace.com/rhizomantik

Rhizome artbase listing for Haiku Trader:

http://rhizome.org/object.php?41160

Whilst Haiku Trader is a public profile, I also maintain a private
project that is only accessible to MySpacers who join as a 'friend'
of Rhizomantic. Rhizomantic as a private profile investigates
distributed poetry in relation to the art life blur. Accessible at
this url:

http://www.myspace.com/rhizomantic

I hope to connect with others interested in digital poetry, haiku,
haiga, and distributed authorship on this list.

Cheers,

Leon Tan

now i like the subliminal kid as much as the next guy. IMHO, as a musician and sound artist he resides in the same rarified air as geniuses like "scratch" perry, harry partch, glenn branca, iannis xenakis, and hugh lecaine.

that having been said, what does this Vivendi advertising spam that the list saw fit to forward to my inbox have to do with poetry?

The Amazon Review Project is a collection of fictions written in the
form of Amazon customer reviews.  In spring, 2007, for a seminar in
first person fiction at San Francisco State, I assigned a number by
Kevin Killian's Amazon Reviews and asked students to develop their
own fictional characters through a series of Amazon reviews.  Their
amazing reviews, as well as an introduction by me, are now on line at
Fanzine:

www.thefanzine.com

The reviewers are:

Tom Andes
Renato Escudero
Michele Hayes
Jim Nelson
Megan O'Patry
Radhika Vyas Sharma
Lee Stegner
Maria Suarez
Jasson Flick

  The Annual Transcontinental Poetry Award by Pavement Saw Press

  All contributors receive books, chapbooks and journals equal to, or more than, the entry fee.
  Please mention this to your friends and all others who might be interested!

  Electronic and mailed entries must meet these requirements:
  1. The manuscript should be at least 48 pages of poetry and no more than 70 pages of poetry in length. Separations between sections are NOT a part of the page count.
  2. A one page cover letter. Include a brief biography, the book's title, your name, address, and telephone number, and, if you have e-mail, your e-mail address. This should be followed by a page which lists publication acknowledgments for the book. For each acknowledgement mention the publisher (journal, anthology, chapbook etc.) and the poem published.
  3. The manuscript should be bound with a single clip and begin with a title page including the book's title, your name, address, and telephone number, and, if you have e-mail, your e-mail address.
  4. The second page should have only the title of the manuscript. There are to be no acknowledgments or mention of the author's name from this page forward. Submissions to the contest are blind judged.
  5. There should be no more than one poem on each page. The manuscript can contain pieces longer than one page.
  6. The manuscript should be paginated, beginning with the first page of poetry.

  Each year Pavement Saw Press will publish at least one book of poetry and/or prose poems from manuscripts received during this competition. Selections are chosen through a blind judging process. The competition is open to anyone who has not previously published a volume of poetry or prose. The author receives $1000 and five percent of the 1000 copy press run. Previous judges have included Judith Vollmer, David Bromige, Bin Ramke and Howard McCord. This year David Baratier will be the judge; past students, Pavement Saw Press interns and employees are not allowed to submit. All poems must be original, all prose must be original, fiction or translations are not acceptable. Writers who have had volumes of poetry and/or prose under 40 pages printed or printed in limited editions of no more than 500 copies are eligible. Submissions are accepted during the months of June, July, and until August 15th. All submissions must have an August 15th, 2007, or earlier, postmark. This is
 an award for first books only.

  If you wish to send via regular mail your manuscript should be accompanied by a check in the amount of $18.00 made payable to Pavement Saw Press. All US contributors to the contest will receive books, chapbooks and journals equal to, or more than, the entry fee. Add $3 (US) for other countries to cover the extra postal charge. Do not include an SASE for notification of results, this information will be sent with the free book. Do not send the only copy of your work. All manuscripts are recycled and individual comments on the manuscripts cannot be made.

  If you wish to submit electronically, you should send $25.00 via paypal to info@pavementsaw.org. We will then send you an e-mail confirmation as well as where to e-mail the manuscript. Electronic submissions need to be sent as PDF files or as word (.doc) files. Other formats are not accepted. The extra cost is to cover the paypal fees as well as the time, labor, ink, and so on, to print out your manuscript. In addition to the prize winner, sometimes another anonymous manuscript is chosen, if enough entries arrive. This “editors choice” manuscript will be published under a standard royalty contract. A decision will be reached in November. Entries should be sent to:

  Pavement Saw Press

  P.O. Box 6291
  Columbus, OH 43206

  All submissions must have an August 15th, or earlier, postmark or paypal payment.

I met that Subliminal Kid since I was his interpreter when he got over to
Italy. I anyhow think that the mail he forwards once or twice a year to the
Buffalo is one of the many he is sending out to advertise his work. He
therefore will never read your or my words, Jason. I guess that what you are
writing is for us to read.
I have no answers to your question.

I like this short piece very much.  I don't have an mp3 player so I can't hear the rest of it, unfortunately.  Nevertheless, if breathing is the body's violence it is also many other more positive things, as well, including, one might say, it's life force.  Regards, Tom Savage

job but not =E2=80=9Cdisabled enough=E2=80=9D to be protected by the ADA. P=

ADA RESTORATION ACT TO BE INTRODUCED JULY 26TH

AAPD (American Associatiom of People with Disabilities) has been working wi=
th a broad coalition of disability organizations who have helped Representa=
tive James Sensenbrenner (R-WI) draft the ADA Restoration Act of 2007, whic=
h would enable Americans with disabilities utilizing the ADA to focus on th=
e discrimination that they have experienced rather than having to first pro=
ve that they fall within the scope of the ADA=E2=80=99s protection. With th=
is bill, the ADA=E2=80=99s clear and comprehensive national mandate for the=
 elimination of discrimination on the basis of disability will be properly =
restored. Majority Leader Steny Hoyer (D-MD), who played a leading role in =
passage of the ADA in 1990, will be an original co-sponsor, but we need mor=
e Representatives to sign onto the bill when it is introduced to show the b=
ipartisan support and importance of this measure.

Your help is urgently needed to garner support and passage of the ADA Resto=
ration Act of 2007. Call your Representative today and ask him/her to co-sp=
onsor the bill. Sample Telephone Message for Use BEFORE JULY 26 seeking ORI=

Olive Juice Music is a D.I.Y. label, studio, and mail-order distributor
based in New York City and interested in helping people who are in the
developmental stages of trying to do something with their art. Olive Juice
Music is not a traditional record label. The artists associated with Olive
Juice take an active part in how their music is produced, financed, and
marketed. They in turn receive more of the profits gained from the sales of
their records directly, which is how it should be. The strength of Olive
Juice relies upon the active participation of its members to share resource=
s
and help promote a communal spirit among everyone involved as well as
claiming responsibility for taking their art to wherever they would like it
to go.

http://boogcityevents.blogspot.com/

Boog City is a New York City-based small press now in its 16th year and Eas=

and Lawrence Ferlinghetti among others, and theme issues on baseball,
women=A9=F6s writing, and Louisville, Ky. It hosts and curates two regular
performance series--d.a. levy lives: celebrating the renegade press, where
each month a non-NYC small press and its writers and a musical act of their
choosing is hosted at Chelsea's ACA Galleries; and Classic Albums Live,
where 5-13 local musical acts perform a classic album live at venues
including The Bowery Poetry Club, CBGB's, and The Knitting Factory. Past

Broumas, Kim Stafford, Barry Lopez, Kenneth Hanson and Gary 	Snyder.

  	This exhibition celebrates the 35th anniversary of Copper Canyon
Press and contains numerous books, broadsides, 	manuscripts and
correspondence borrowed from the press, the John Wilson Special
Collections, and other collections.

Anyone familiar with or former friends with Armin Landeck, the artist?

  One of the folks I am friends with thru lucasfilm says he is quite something and I just have no readily available info. Except for having seen a few prints from the thirties and a few works in museums I know little. Anyone privy and willing to inform me?


Be well

Bored for a moment I looked up a few of our books on Abe Books
  some are listed for $350.

  What a bizarre thought as I wonder where my next
  filled gas tank will come from.

  I feel like I feel after talking to Will Alexander for too many hours.
  (by the way, why has no one talked about _Sunrise in Armageddon_
  or any of the other more recently released material?)

  Somebody want to sell me copies of Chris Stroffolino's first book Oops, or Doug Goetsch's Wherever you are?

It's good to BITCH!  Whenever someone tells me it's not good to bitch I
think of something to bitch about as soon as possible!  It's healthy, it
makes space for better things in your mind, right?  So feel free to bitch
about your own experiences of being a poet who was fucked over, it's good to
air these things out.

There are a few incidents that I'd like to cover on this topic of being
fucked over as a poet, but let me start with the most recent one.

Will Esposito invited me, Frank Sherlock, Ish Klein, Ryan Eckes, and Abbi
Dion to have our poems about animal cruelty included in a Philadelphia
gallery recently, organized around the evil Pennsylvania Amish and their
puppy mills.  It seemed great!  We were excited!  And Will and Abbi put
together a beautiful handmade book of our poems to be displayed in the
gallery.

A couple weeks ago the gallery had a rather large private party with lots of
wealthy patrons and local political figures (including Michael Nutter who is
running for mayor, and there was also a liaison from the governor's office
in Harrisburg).  We poets were invited to bring one guest, and to read our
poems.  Once again, we were excited, right?  It's a party!  We get to read
at a party!  Reading at a party sounds like a great thing, right!?

Well, the woman running the show met us and made a bit of a face.  Were we
that bad?  Are we that crazy looking?  I don't usually think we are, but
maybe I'm biased?  But then again my guest was a six and a half foot giant
lesbian poet named Janet Mason who got drunk a little too fast and told this
woman that she especially LOVED the little cheese-filled pea pods because
they looked like fairy vaginas.  Maybe that did it, who know?  Frank
Sherlock had his pink machine gun shirt on.  Who knows?  The drunker Ish and
Abbi and I got the more glitter we applied to our faces and cleavage.  But
we weren't horrible people, clearly, just having fun for fuck's sake!  Can't
we have fun!?

Must we sit as still as possible?  But they were serving LOTS AND LOTS of
FREE cocktails!  How can you POSSIBLY explain handing out as many free
cocktails as people want to drink and expect those people to sit as still as
possible?  If you've got cocktails, and glitter, and friends, it's a fun
night.  Just shut up and have fun, GEESH!!

Will went up to the woman running the show more than once, and she kept
making these weird "OH NO" faces when she walked away from him.  She kept
telling him "later," "later, you'll read later."

"Later" and "Maybe" means No with this class of pricks.  Where I come from
no one has time for such games and just says NO!  The working class NO
should be a university class.  Call it "HOW NOT TO BE A LYING ASSHOLE 101."

But it was really irritating, all this!  Oh, we can't have THE POETS at the
microphone!  We have REAL people here tonight!

Yeah, and those REAL people were drinking lots and lots of martinis, just
like the poets were doing!

Man, and I was looking forward to badmouthing the Amish to a large audience
FINALLY, the Amish being a group of fascists I grew up near and have hated
for many years.

At the end of the night I tried to get the microphone to work but it had
been disabled, JUST IN CASE!

So we read our poems out on the sidewalk to one another, and to the jazz
musicians who were also not happy about the way they had been treated at the
party.  That jazz trio was SUPERB by the way!  They did old standards, but
with a flippant kind of sting!  NICE!

I'm glad to have been part of the gallery show because the subject of animal
cruelty is something I care deeply about, but it was ridiculous to fear us
at the microphone.  WE WERE ONLY GOING TO READ THE POEMS THAT WERE ALREADY
SITTING ON A PODIUM FOR EVERYONE TO READ ANYWAY!  Well, actually I also
wanted to complain at the microphone that they were serving chicken and crab
cakes.  Puppies are cute and sweet, but chickens and crabs deserve to die?
I'm not judging meat eaters, especially because when I ate meat I ate enough
of it for one lifetime, but it's wrong to have a benefit about animal
cruelty and have little bits of animal roasted and toasted and stuck on the
ends of fancy sticks.  Well, and I did also want to call the Amish nazis at
the microphone FINALLY!  I've been waiting to do that all my fucking life!

Listen, all I'm saying is DON'T FUCKING INVITE POETS AND EXPECT A TEA
PARTY!  Unless of course it's Billy Collins or Sharon Olds, both of whom
seem content sitting as still as possible and boring the shit out of any
room that wants to fall asleep.

notes on code:

study of huddling http://www.asondheim.org/huddled.mp4

Major modality:
Relationship between modeling and codework:
mapping within the subtext/substructure of the metric.
Visual modeling: Visual as thetic  - modality of happenstance (i.e.
modeling becomes dependent on the physiology of visual bandwidth).
Aural modeling: Visual with similar field, different spatial modality.

How is the thetic (is that the correct word?) in relation to ideality?
Does political economy depend on visual/aural physiology?

Scanning as doubled text: coded software / parameterization of the real
tending towards results which are residue (separate the results from the
structure). But within the phenomenology of the real, the results and
structure are inextricably tangled.

Motion capture (mocap) - see scanning. In scanning, the static object is
standard; in motion capture, the dynamic object. Think perhaps of the
latter in terms of a second-order differential - doubled modeling of
changes (1. through mocap; 2. through 'accelerated modeling').

The results: the 'code carapace' or chiten - Barrier/revelation code.
(Older work: The relation of consciousness to structured systems: what are
the manifestations of those systems?) Code as armor.

Seeing and hearing seem 'tawdry,' unable to sustain the abstracted or
philosophical weight placed upon them. To see or hear text philosophically
churns on transparency; everything else stumbles. We turn to writing
because it gets away from us to the extent that it's also reflective of
deep abstraction, alien-code (all code is alien).

All code is alien because it calls from elsewhere - or rather, doesn't
call at all; it's as if someone created it, it's as if it wasn't created,
not a bit of it.

Which is the fundamental phenomenological status of code: some of it is
created, but some of it isn't.

  The why's are below.   Quick easy info here though – your ONE (pain-free) PHONE CALL will absolutely count:


  THE HONORABLE GOVERNOR BOB RILEY
  State Capitol
  600 Dexter   Avenue
  Montgomery,  Alabama 36130

  No time left to write!!
  Call:   (334) 242 7100
  Fax:     334-353-0004

  Calling is a very easy process.  Call (334) 242-7100.  Tell the person answering who you are, where you live, and say something like ** "Please count me as having called to ask the Governor to halt the execution of Darrell Grayson." ** They WILL count you and you will find them courteous.  They will not engage you in argument, nor will they expect or need you to elaborate.  That is best handled in writing.

  FAX: 334 242 0937
  Website: http://www.governor.state.al.us
  Email form: http://www.governor.state.al.us/contact.htm

  Darrell "confessed" but, confessions are not always what they seem (http://phadp.org/falseconfessions.html).

   ~

  DNA evidence is available which has never been tested.  Darrell Grayson, facing execution, has been denied the right to have DNA testing.

   ~

  Darrell Grayson, as a young, poor, African-American, was convicted by an all-white jury.

    ~

  Darrell's trial attorney had no experience in capital cases.  He  practiced divorce law.

  BIO:

  Darrell B. Grayson was raised in Montevallo, Alabama with eleven siblings in a single parent household. He dropped out of school in the ninth grade.  At age 19, and with no prior criminal history, he was convicted and received the death penalty from an all white jury.  He has been on Death Row at Holman Prison in Atmore,  Alabama since 1982.  After some years of severe depression, which he describes as spending flat on his back, the death of his mother brought about the decision to better himself. He began to write commentary and poetry and received his GED and Associate Science degree. In 1994 he became active in Project Hope to Abolish the Death Penalty, an organization founded and operated by Death Row inmates. In 2000 he became its chairman.  He edits and assembles Wings of Hope, the Project Hope newsletter, with primitive equipment in the prison.

  Darrell Grayson's poetry, which he describes as "a contagion of insecurities," has appeared in Axis of Logic, Right Hand Pointing, The Dead Mule, Wings of Hope, and elsewhere. He has written three chapbooks of poetry from prison.

   ~~

  DARRELL GRAYSON'S STATEMENT  --
  http://dalewisely.googlepages.com/darrellgraysonexecutionalert

  After 20+ years on death row and acceptance of guilt, I came to question my participation in the crime of which I was convicted and for which I received the death penalty. My family, friends and acquaintances had never believed it, as I had no prior criminal record or reputation for violence.

  Six years ago my belief in my guilt was shaken because a witness who had been with my co-defendant, myself and another individual that night, came forward to state unequivocally that I could not have committed the crime as I was passed out cold on the floor due to drugs and alcohol. Furthermore, the statement from the witness that my co- defendant had borrowed my jacket that night when he left and committed the crime, explained how jewelry belonging to the victim had supposedly been found in my wallet, which I always kept in my pocket. I was not present when the police found the jewelry.

  It had never made sense to me how I, a non-secretor, could have my blood type identified from the semen. The Innocence Project determined that the tests used by the State would not have been able to identify my blood type, nor would they have been reliable. The argument made by the State that I could have ejaculated twice did not coincide with my sexual history, which told me that when under the influence, I would not even be able to ejaculate once, let alone twice. My total inebriation has never been in question.

  In the eyes of my attorneys and the state my guilt had largely rested on my "confession" and that I never retracted it. I did not retract it because I have no knowledge of that night. Hindsight tells me that my confession was due to questionable evidence and suggested scenario presented to me, a suggestive personality, psychological intimidation with good cop/bad cop tactics and my debilitated physical and emotional state due to substance withdrawal.

  [Continued in detail here -- http://dalewisely.googlepages.com/darrellgraysonexecutionalert ]

  ~~

  Richard Bell, Darrell's original trial attorney, has written the Governor with an excellent summary of the injustices associated with this case.

  "...there is great question as to whether Darrell Grayson did, in fact, commit this crime.

  Darrell Grayson was caught in the trap of poverty and was unable to present his defense to the jury in this case. As I once stated to the Supreme Court during oral argument, the method of funding or lack thereof in this case was tantamount to having my hands tied behind me..."

  -from Attorney Richard Bell to Gov. Riley, July 16, 2007

I don't know if this can be validated, but Ginsberg quoted Kenneth
Rexroth as saying the following:=20

"writers are terrible people,
you don't want them in your house"

I think I'd turn that around and say that it's sanctimonious,
cloth-eared art gallery types who are the terrible people -- the turds
in the punchbowl, as it were.

on a semi-related note, I have an ongoing argument with my non-poet
friends that the "Garrison Keillor" phenomenon does not really promote
the appreciation of most poetry, just makes it safe for squares (i.e.,
Billy Collins or Sharon Olds, et al.) -- not that there's anything wrong
with safe poetry, but it sounds like this vernissage featured art
intended to push the envelope -- big-time social and artistic
disconnect, apparently.

Safe poetry, dangerous poetry, I've never understood why people don't simply find poetry fun to read. Something to do, I guess, with high school. I didn't like poetry in high school, but I didn't like much of anything in high school. The problem, i think, is too much lame, middle brow poetry--

                                           It's all kids hear.
                                           Post Columbine kids are unlikely to give a shit about anything
                                           Billy Collins has to say.
                                           I get fed up with poets, especially the ones with talent who do little to challenge themselves.
  The Billy Collins/Linda Pasten's of the world.
  They know what they're doing, and they're comfortable doing it.
  They've done what they do for so long, it surprises me that they're not bored sick by now.
  But they've found a comfort zone.
  Who'd want to risk all of that comfort?

I live in a small midwest community and have just about given up trying to have poetry readings because people are not interested, and yes, this is Garrison Keilor country (really truly--he started his radio show in this county), and there is a certain kind of safety that most people (generalities, generatlies, I knoew) only can relate to--the drunken students who roam the bars downtown and the few criminal elements that live here are the only ones that kick up their heals and get down. I miss the idea of craziness, and perhaps even the reality of craziness. Sigh.

  It's good to BITCH! Whenever someone tells me it's not good to bitch I
think of something to bitch about as soon as possible! It's healthy, it
makes space for better things in your mind, right? So feel free to bitch
about your own experiences of being a poet who was fucked over, it's good to
air these things out.

There are a few incidents that I'd like to cover on this topic of being
fucked over as a poet, but let me start with the most recent one.

Will Esposito invited me, Frank Sherlock, Ish Klein, Ryan Eckes, and Abbi
Dion to have our poems about animal cruelty included in a Philadelphia
gallery recently, organized around the evil Pennsylvania Amish and their
puppy mills. It seemed great! We were excited! And Will and Abbi put
together a beautiful handmade book of our poems to be displayed in the
gallery.

A couple weeks ago the gallery had a rather large private party with lots of
wealthy patrons and local political figures (including Michael Nutter who is
running for mayor, and there was also a liaison from the governor's office
in Harrisburg). We poets were invited to bring one guest, and to read our
poems. Once again, we were excited, right? It's a party! We get to read
at a party! Reading at a party sounds like a great thing, right!?

Well, the woman running the show met us and made a bit of a face. Were we
that bad? Are we that crazy looking? I don't usually think we are, but
maybe I'm biased? But then again my guest was a six and a half foot giant
lesbian poet named Janet Mason who got drunk a little too fast and told this
woman that she especially LOVED the little cheese-filled pea pods because
they looked like fairy vaginas. Maybe that did it, who know? Frank
Sherlock had his pink machine gun shirt on. Who knows? The drunker Ish and
Abbi and I got the more glitter we applied to our faces and cleavage. But
we weren't horrible people, clearly, just having fun for fuck's sake! Can't
we have fun!?

Must we sit as still as possible? But they were serving LOTS AND LOTS of
FREE cocktails! How can you POSSIBLY explain handing out as many free
cocktails as people want to drink and expect those people to sit as still as
possible? If you've got cocktails, and glitter, and friends, it's a fun
night. Just shut up and have fun, GEESH!!

Will went up to the woman running the show more than once, and she kept
making these weird "OH NO" faces when she walked away from him. She kept
telling him "later," "later, you'll read later."

"Later" and "Maybe" means No with this class of pricks. Where I come from
no one has time for such games and just says NO! The working class NO
should be a university class. Call it "HOW NOT TO BE A LYING ASSHOLE 101."

But it was really irritating, all this! Oh, we can't have THE POETS at the
microphone! We have REAL people here tonight!

Yeah, and those REAL people were drinking lots and lots of martinis, just
like the poets were doing!

Man, and I was looking forward to badmouthing the Amish to a large audience
FINALLY, the Amish being a group of fascists I grew up near and have hated
for many years.

At the end of the night I tried to get the microphone to work but it had
been disabled, JUST IN CASE!

So we read our poems out on the sidewalk to one another, and to the jazz
musicians who were also not happy about the way they had been treated at the
party. That jazz trio was SUPERB by the way! They did old standards, but
with a flippant kind of sting! NICE!

I'm glad to have been part of the gallery show because the subject of animal
cruelty is something I care deeply about, but it was ridiculous to fear us
at the microphone. WE WERE ONLY GOING TO READ THE POEMS THAT WERE ALREADY
SITTING ON A PODIUM FOR EVERYONE TO READ ANYWAY! Well, actually I also
wanted to complain at the microphone that they were serving chicken and crab
cakes. Puppies are cute and sweet, but chickens and crabs deserve to die?
I'm not judging meat eaters, especially because when I ate meat I ate enough
of it for one lifetime, but it's wrong to have a benefit about animal
cruelty and have little bits of animal roasted and toasted and stuck on the
ends of fancy sticks. Well, and I did also want to call the Amish nazis at
the microphone FINALLY! I've been waiting to do that all my fucking life!

Listen, all I'm saying is DON'T FUCKING INVITE POETS AND EXPECT A TEA
PARTY! Unless of course it's Billy Collins or Sharon Olds, both of whom
seem content sitting as still as possible and boring the shit out of any
room that wants to fall asleep.

Thanks very much for putting this out there.

Like the others who have replied so far, I experienced absolutely no
complications
on the phone with the governor's office.  The call took probably 30
seconds, max.

While Kyle and Cuneiform are on a roll here, I also recommend Bill Berkson'=
s
recent book, Sudden Address - a selection of Bill's various lectures that
often 'address' the intrigue of where painting and poetry cross mediums in
that often difficult to address 'conversation'.   Where often the makers of
text are blind to painting and makers of visual work are blind to text, it'=
s
great to have someone (eyes/ears - paintings and books) working the
transept. =20
Also a lovely edition, the typography, design. It's also nice to have
another press aspiring to have great production values without being weirdl=
y
precious or de luxe, but with a focus on being publicly accessible and
affordable. Not that Kyle is alone here, but he's obviously doing his
homework and/or worked with good mentors among makers of books.

I thought that both of you would be good people to tell about the two
job openings we have on poetryfoundation.org=97one for a journalist and
the other for a serious poet who can also write and edit prose. We're
looking for a journalist to be the associate editor and the poet to be
the archive editor. Here are links to the job descriptions:

In the flurry of JC activity last month I noticed that
the poem "Transmigraion Solo" over at the official JC
site - http://www.josephceravolo.com/poems.html#trans
- uses the word "there" in the fourth line:

TRANSMIGRATION SOLO

See the black bird
in that tree
trying out the branches, puzzled.
I am up there with you
puzzled against the rain
blinking my eyes.

But in his book the word is "here."

TRANSMIGRATION SOLO

See the black bird
in that tree
trying out the branches, puzzled.
I am up here with you
puzzled against the rain
blinking my eyes.

I want to believe the book is right, since "here"
provides a jump to the poem that is more typical of
JC's unorthodox style. Or, I guess, the jump is
already there in the last line. But "here" makes it
sooner and more pronounced. Less SoQ if you will.

Anyone know for sure the intended word?

              Grayson

MONTGOMERY - Governor Bob Riley issued the following statement on Thursday about the scheduled execution of Darrell Grayson: There has been much attention focused on the convicted killer, but seemingly ignored has been consideration of his victim, Mrs. Annie Laura Orr. She was a defenseless 86-year-old woman who lived alone and died a horrifying death almost 27 years ago. The killer's own numerous confessions, his own trial testimony where he himself admitted guilt, and the overwhelming physical evidence left a jury no doubt he perpetrated a cruel and monstrous crime upon a helpless elderly woman.
 Despite his multiple confessions and the physical evidence, the convicted killer filed several appeals after his conviction. All were denied by state and federal courts.  His convictions of burglary and murder have been upheld at each level of the appellate process.
 No new evidence has come to light that would warrant either a reprieve or a commutation. DNA testing would neither prove nor disprove this killer's guilt. He was convicted of burglary and murder, not rape and murder, so legally DNA testing would not exonerate him even if there is no DNA evidence that he raped Mrs. Orr. Non-DNA evidence of the convicted murderer's guilt, however, is abundant. Barring intervention by the U.S. Supreme Court, this execution will go forward as scheduled.

more.  Adults Need Quality, Interesting, Creative,
Critical Educational Opportunities Outside of the Job
and the Academy!  You are invited to join a discussion
with a panel featuring representatives of local
educational initiatives committed to cultural learning
for adults in Chicago. These organizations and
projects operate outside of traditional paradigms such
as ESL/GED and professional skill development. We hope
to highlight a range of important work happening in
the city and encourage new participation in those
efforts where it is appropriate. Additionally, by
showcasing innovative cultural education for adults,
we will gain a better sense what possibilities are
currently available to adults seeking stimulation
outside of traditional educational settings and better
understand what this means for all of our efforts and
our city.

**Saturday 8.4, 11:00am**
How We Move Workshop: Meredith Haggerty & Lavie Raven
How We Move will be a workshop in movement and how it
relates to social movements. The workshop leaders have
been brought together by the University of Hip Hop,
which has been doing movement education in the city

more information.

How We Make a Pedagogical Sketchbook
w/ Stockyard Institute
The Pedagogical Sketchbook began as an obsessive
compilation of ideas and lessons, that stood in stark
contrast to the typical offerings most adolescents
were exposed to in their school art space. The project
which now includes an audio curriculum is growing as
artists, thinkers, map makers, socialites, ex
students, construction workers, priests, addicts and
ideologues to name only few have joined in making
contributions to what will be presented as a new high
school art textbook. The project will be published on
demand and developed as an online resource. One copy
of the project will be sent to every high school art
department in Illinois. factory07 @ gmail.com.
Jim Duignan is an artist, educator and activist and
drives the collaborative artist project Stockyard
Institute. Duignan directs Visual Arts Education at
DePaul University in Chicago and works as an advisor

How We Peoples Make a People's Atlas of Chicago
w/ Daniel Tucker/Dave Pabellon aka The Speculators
Free Food Day
12-3pm
Calling all mapmakers, radical historians, informal
researchers and citizens with good memory!
How can we use maps to remember? What do we want to
remember? Notes for a People's Atlas presents maps of
the blank outline of the political border of the city.
For this event we will get together and look at a map
archive that was created on a recent trip to Zagreb,
Croatia by AREA Chicago editors Daniel Tucker and Dave
Pabellon. The other map archive is AREA's ongoing
collection of Chicago maps by local artists,
educators, students and activists. Please come and add
your map to the archive! Because maps are never
finished and only tell part of a story. Because they
are visual tools for sharing with others. Because they
can be produced by many people and combined together
to tell stories about complex relationships. Because
power exists in space, struggle exists in space, and
we exist in space. Because we cannot we know where we
are going if we don't know where we are from.

How We Think Walking Tour: In Honor of John Dewey
11-1pm
The philosopher John Dewey (1859-1952) fought for
"civil and academic freedom, founded the Progressive
School movement." A resident of Chicago's Hyde Park
neighborhood, Dewey published one of his most
important works of educational theory "How We Think"
in 1910. The study deals primarily with the concept of
thought training, and its place in school
environments. Today we will have a walking
presentation and discussion about Dewey's impact on
the field of education and visit some important sites
in the neighborhood where he lived and worked. Contact
factory07 @ gmail.com if you know a lot about Dewey
and would like to help lead the tour.

**Wednesday 9.5, 6-8pm**
How We Celebrate Peoples History
w/ Josh MacPhee of JustSeeds
Come Hear About One Amazing Effort To Make Hidden and
Radical History Public! It Is A Street Curriculum!
The Celebrated People's History poster series is an
on-going project producing posters that focus around
important moments in "people's history." These are
events, groups, and individuals that we should
celebrate because of their importance in the struggle
for social justice and freedom, but are instead buried
or erased by dominant history. Posters celebrate
important acts of resistance, those who fought
tirelessly for justice and truth, and the days on
which we can claim victories for the forces of
freedom. These posters are posted publicly (i.e.
wheatpasted on the street, put up in peoples' home and
storefront windows, and used in classrooms) in an
attempt to help generate a discussion about our
radical past, a discussion that is vital in preparing
us to create a radical future. The project has also
built a loose network of artists interested in
creating radical public art as well as showcased the
work of lesser known artists that want to create
culture that is functional, carries a social message,
and doesn't get buried at the bottom of the heap of
the mainstream art world.
http://www.justseeds.org/artists/celebrate_peoples_history/.
 Josh MacPhee is an artist, curator and activist
currently living in Troy, NY. His work often revolves
around themes of radical politics, privatization and
public space. His second book Realizing the
Impossible: Art Against Authority (AK Press, co-edited
with Erik Reuland) was just published. He also
organizes the Celebrate People's History Poster Series
and is part of the political art collective
Justseeds.org.

**Saturday 9.8, 1-3pm**
How We Build
Come discuss the state of architecture/design
education. Where has it been and where is it going? We
often discuss the ways in which the built physical
environment affects us, but how does it get built in
the first place? What is the relationship between
architecture education and the built environment? How
does what gets taught to children, adults and
professionals impact the designed world? And how can
we rethink it? To get involved in the discussion
contact Charles Vinz charles.vinz @ gmail.com or just
show up!

**Saturday 9.15**
How We Make a Disorientation Guide to Our University
w/ Local University Activists
1-3pm
In recent years many students and professors have
turned their research interests towards the university
itself. They have considered how to translate the
activism and critique that is generally encouraged and
supported when projected outward on the world, into a
more inward practice that identifies the particular
political economy of today's university system. What
role and responsibilities do universities have in the
urban spaces they inhabit, in the knowledge economies
they facilitate, in the concepts about which they
produce research, and the contracts they receive and
provide? Today we will work with students from several
local universities, including Northwestern and
University of Chicago, to talk about one of the works
in the Pedagogical Factory exhibit which displays such
self-critical research about the US academic system in
the form of a "Disorientation Guide" to UNC Chapel
Hill. We will use this work as a starting point to
discuss the possibilities of creating similar
initiatives in Chicago academic contexts. Get in touch
with factory07 @ gmail.com if you are interested in
participating.

**Saturday 9.22**
How we use AREA Chicago as a pedagogical experiment
and also move towards an independent political and
cultural education network in Chicago.  In this final
event of the series we will reflect on the work and
conversations of the Pedagogical Factory Exhibit and
the programs of the How We Learn series. We will look
towards the upcoming "How We Learn" issue#5 of AREA
Chicago and make plans for using the project in new
and different ways as a freely distributed curriculum
about critical culture in Chicago. Come and
participate in the discussion and perhaps we will all
build a school together. Topics to be discussed might
include: Militant research, public curriculum, the
limits of popular education, the drawbacks of critical
pedagogy, and school versus the street, the street
versus the art gallery, the page versus the screen,
and why binary relationships have gotten us down. A
short presentation about the past/present/future of
AREA Chicago will be followed by group discussion and
brainstorming. Please come with the best old ideas or
the new fresh ideas.

**Unless otherwise noted**
All events will take place at HPAC /Wednesday events
start at 6pm and Saturday events start at 1pm-3pm/ All
events are 2 hours long/All events are in Gallery 1.
The Art Center is easily accessible by public
transportation: Take the #6 Jackson Park Express to E.

The Governor's statement is a precis of the State of Alabama's December =
2006 response to Darrell Grayson's petition for STR DNA testing.  That =
document is merciless.  Whether DNA testing might prove Darrell Grayson =
innocent of rape, or implicate a third unidentified party, is considered =
moot.  Because he is sentenced to death for burglary and murder, whether =
or not he committed rape is considered irrelevant by the State today, =
though a conviction that he did indeed commit rape surely informed the =
severity of his sentence.  Surely, especially in the case of a developing =
technology (and Grayson has been in prison for 27 years, since he was 19, =
I think), there should always be a right to testing.  And there should =
always be a right to exonerate a person convicted of any crime he or she =
did not commit, and they should have this satisfaction before they die. =

As to the surreal experience of calling the Governor's office to request =
that the State of Alabama does not kill a man today, well, that's reality.

>>> amyhappens@yahoo.com 07/26/07 3:25 PM >>>
MONTGOMERY - Governor Bob Riley issued the following statement on Thursday =
about the scheduled execution of Darrell Grayson: There has been much =
attention focused on the convicted killer, but seemingly ignored has been =
consideration of his victim, Mrs. Annie Laura Orr. She was a defenseless =
86-year-old woman who lived alone and died a horrifying death almost 27 =
years ago. The killer's own numerous confessions, his own trial testimony =
where he himself admitted guilt, and the overwhelming physical evidence =
left a jury no doubt he perpetrated a cruel and monstrous crime upon a =
helpless elderly woman.=20
 Despite his multiple confessions and the physical evidence, the convicted =
killer filed several appeals after his conviction. All were denied by =
state and federal courts.  His convictions of burglary and murder have =
been upheld at each level of the appellate process.=20
 No new evidence has come to light that would warrant either a reprieve or =
a commutation. DNA testing would neither prove nor disprove this killer's =
guilt. He was convicted of burglary and murder, not rape and murder, so =
legally DNA testing would not exonerate him even if there is no DNA =
evidence that he raped Mrs. Orr. Non-DNA evidence of the convicted =
murderer's guilt, however, is abundant. Barring intervention by the U.S. =
Supreme Court, this execution will go forward as scheduled.

Well, I'm glad for all the support for this topic, but I really wish those
of you who back-channeled me would tell those stories you told me to
the List, as everyone else would like to hear them as much I did.

There seem to be so many incidents of being fucked over as a poet in my
life, but I'm sad to report (very sad actually) that in most cases it was
from other poets.  At least one of whom is on this List.  No, two of them
actually, one was sort-of a friend, the other I never trusted.  I don't feel
the need to Out scoundrels since I live by my grandmother's advice that the
honest man's best revenge is patience.  Besides, they both have new books
out this year, and I don't want to be accused of cock-blocking another
poet's publishing joys.

Instead let me talk about being fucked over a few years ago by The Blue Rose
Moon Theater Company.

The director and producers were looking for material on Elvis for a big show
they were putting together for the Philadelphia Fringe Festival.  I answered
the call for submissions and gave them pages from my forthcoming book
"advanced ELVIS course" and they enthusiastically used all the pages I gave
them.  That made me happy of course!  I had never seen my work performed on
stage before so it was very exciting for me!

There were two other writers, but the bulk of the lines, the stage-settings,
costumes, acting, etc., came from my pages of text.  For some reason I
couldn't make opening night, but I knew all the shows had sold out, and it
was getting great press and feedback.  On the second night I showed up in a
terrific mood to a packed house, all chairs filled, and some folks were even
sitting on the floor.  But yet there were no programs.

I asked the director where the programs were.  He said that the programs had
several typos in the one actress's bio (the one playing Priscilla Presley),
and that they weren't using them because she threw a major tantrum about the
typos.  NOT USING THEM!?  The programs were the ONLY place where the names
of the writers appeared.  We had not been mentioned in the newspapers, or
online, or anywhere.  We were literally invisible to the outside world, but
that didn't bother me, as I was certain anyone who went to the show would
see who we were in the program.

Were the programs handed out on opening night I asked the director?  No.

It had been reported, and told to me personally that the mayor had attended
that opening night show, as did the police commissioner, both of them major
Elvis fans.

Who was taking credit for all this?  The actors, and director, and
producers.

Yet ALL THE WORK they were doing made them mere satellites to orbit the work
of the writers.  To say the least my terrific mood ended.  If these people
knew how to write they would have done so themselves!  And I was suddenly
feeling crazy with anger!

The director and I had a screaming match, and I was told later that some of
the audience thought it was part of the show, yelling about Elvis, the
mayor, the vain actress playing Priscilla.

I demanded that the programs be handed out or that I was going to make a
scene.  I was already making a scene the director said, so it was too late
to NOT make a scene.  Fine then, I'll make a BIGGER SCENE!

Finally he gave in.

The programs were brought out, and with them came the actress in her
Priscilla costume to take a shot at yelling at me.  She really DID NOT care
that the writers were being ignored.  It blew my mind that these people
simply didn't care.  The injustice I felt, and yelled about feeling
penetrated none of them.  It was STUNNING to witness this level of
selfishness.

Finally the director instructed someone to hand out programs to everyone in
the audience.  When I opened the program we three writers were mentioned by
name, period.  Nothing else.  I don't remember the names of the other two
writers because I didn't keep the program, the only place where our names
appeared.

The bios we writers had submitted to the director had been cut at some
point.  The actors had paragraphs explaining every fucking school they
had ever attended, and their awards, etc., etc., oh boy I was angry.  What
was the point of the program to me with no information?  We writers were
truly made invisible.  And the other two writers had been there the night
before and -- TO MY HORROR AND DISAPPOINTMENT -- didn't make a fuss about
there being no program handed out.  There's nothing worse in a situation
like this than being only one of three who actually gives a damn!  This is
another reason I don't remember the names of the other two writers because I
feel they were chumps the both of them, not caring, and not making the
program be handed out the night before!

What a rotten bunch of people!  But they did a good job on stage with the
material.  Although I have to say that the material I wrote was writing I
worked very hard on, believed in, continue to believe in.  They on the other
hand were simply acting, and it was clear it didn't mean much to them, just
another job.  Just another ping for the point system of a resume.

Later the director e-mailed me and I told him to NEVER contact me again.  He
had a pain of guilt, or something, finally, and I told him the guilt was
probably good for him.  The guilt was real I told him.  He wasn't needing to
act the part, he was it.  And good luck in Hell.

Oh, and they sold out every single show, made a pile of money, but we
writers saw none of that either.

Did we have a contract?  No.  That's the problem of course when we don't
know about these things.  But for some remarkable reason I expected honesty
and fairness from actors.  What a dope I was.  I should have known better
having dated actors.  My least favorite people next to terrorists are
actors.  Actors should only date one another, otherwise they are only
interested in polluting the rest of our souls.

Despite all this circus of the other two cowardly writers, the dishonest and
selfish acting company, etc., my poems keep coming.  That's the real beauty
of this world.  The real payoff.  And of course I know better now than to
trust so much.

Were you supposed to be entertainment, or part of a program?

Was this a "literary evening" or a "fundraiser"?

I don't know, in my experience a lot of these things change during the
event, especially if the planner doesn't have a lot of experience, or
thought that the poetry would be entertainment like the band (although
there seemed to be aproblem with that as well), or planned a program
but realized that people were giving more money just drinking and
eating fairy vaginas or whatever.  Hey, at least it wasn't a "no host"
bar and you thought ahead and brought glitter.

Tinfish Press's “Send a Book to a War Criminal” Drive

Tinfish Press has just published a chapbook by Sarith Peou, titled
CORPSE WATCHING. This book of poems details Peou's experiences under the
genocidal Khmer Rouge regime in Cambodia. Please see
http://tinfishpress.com/corpse.html for details.

I decided to send a copy to former Secretary of State and Nobel Peace
Prize Laureate, Henry Kissinger, whose actions were largely responsible
for the Khmer Rouge's coming to power in 1975.

But I want everyone to have this chance. Send $10 to Tinfish Press (less
than the usual price of $12) and we will send a copy of the book to the
war criminal of your choice with a personalized card to say who's
responsible for sending it along. There are many such war
criminals—choose one or more. If at all possible, please track down
their addresses for us.

I was telling CA's story of the Animal Rights event for a friend last
night, and he summed it up with:=20

the Left screwing the Leftover

does that fairly describe what was going on? were the organizers/
attendees what you'd call "institutional Lefties," or was I wrong to
paint such a picture?=20

(please don't take the epithet "Leftover" as a put-down: my friend was
trying to draw a distinction between innovative artists and the
politically progressive but socially more conservative sponsors)

my image of the event was that the poets were too wild-eyed and
expressive for the organizers to comfortably include them (which is the
fault of the organizers for not getting a handle on who they were
inviting, their work and the energy they would bring to the event).=20

I love the image of the poets and jazz musicians meeting up outside for
their own party: did anyone take pictures?=20

What is the National Execution Alert?
 The National Execution Alert is a monthly news bulletin that highlights the stories of death row inmates scheduled for execution in the current and coming months.

  How do I respond to the Alerts?
 NCADP's action center now provides direct links to e-mail governors, legislators, and state leaders. We encourage all subscribers to use this system to voice their concerns about pending executions.

  Also, the State Alert pages include contact information for major newspapers and local affiliates.

Activist are so uptight. & poets just want to have fun. Maybe if the organizers had managed to land Peter Singer, get him wasted, everyone would have left the party feeling fine.

Tom and Catherine:
Catherine first:
Well, I see what you're saying, but we were supposed to read, had been
invited to read.  And what I wound up reading was the body language of the
host.  She knew what she was doing, meaning she wanted to X us from it, and
did.  And she never once came to say anything like, "whoops, sorry," etc.,
just this constant, "you'll read later" shit.  Very passive-aggressive in
the fashion of the guilty coward.  And yeah, we had fun, but it was still a
bunch of bullshit.  She clearly did not want us at the microphone.  And yes
it was a fundraiser, but for me it was an awareness night, and we poets had
things to say that NO ONE else who took to that microphone had said.  But
Will and Abbi made a nice looking book, which people did pick up and read,
so, that's good.  And I had fun, but I was still pissed off, as were others.

Tom:  yes, I think you're right on about getting the frame of who these
people are.  They are indeed that heavy branch of the Left enclosed into
their own closed-circuit vision.  Too much to jeopardize, which is exactly
why we poets were uninvited with lies and a disabled microphone.  I'm not
paranoid, just observant.  But those peach martinis were superb!  And no way
am I offended by you saying the Leftovers.  It's exactly right, and the
quietly, covertly conservative Left is banking on a lot of folks who don't
want the boat to rock, and to allow, support, and perpetuate the lie that
everyone is invited.  It's the Hillary Clinton fireworks so many buy, like
many of us bought her husband's lies his first time around.  I bring up
Hillary because one woman had a "Hillary for President" button on at this
affair.  It was pinned to a very expensive looking suit she will probably
wear to a tea party with the Daughters of the Revolution.  But the open
support for Clinton summed up the room for me.  I expect such people to want
someone like Clinton.  Hillary and Bill have done an EXCELLENT job at making
all the right gestures into the wind about how much they care.  Hillary and
Bill have made it A-OKAY to pretend to care, or maybe they were riding a
wave of this behavior already in motion?  But the tyranny of our time and of
our country is found in the remarkable UNSAID about what's ignored.  If
there are people in the future I'm sure they will be clear about everything
we protected to maintain the worst things imaginable.  The possible
people of the future will see the Clintons (for example), really see them,
because if there are people in the future I'm POSITIVE they will not have
the luxury of our time where so much effort was put into pretending to
care.  Our selfishness makes the future almost impossibly honest.

The images of the Koran here are gorgeous. I have
appreciated the Bhaga MP3 also..one listens, is

Hi all,=20
=20
and sorry, this is a botany question.
When I first arrived back in Oakland, I moved in to my friend (artist) Eric=
 King's old place. He left me many useful things. In addition, he left me a=
 plant, a peace lily, that sat in a dark corner for 2 years (out of my igno=
rance). I thought it was a green leafed plant and was happy with that.I hav=
e since named the plant *Oscar* [it's the only other living thing in my stu=
dio, so I thought a name was appropriate] and haved transplanted it to my n=
ew place where it sits in the window and sunlight.It seems to be doing grea=
t. At the moment it has a less than a half bloom, which it has had for four=
 days now, that is half bloom not going to full bloom. I didn't know this p=
lant bloomed.These are my question, how long does a peace lily take to full=
 bloom?=20
=20
Have the cloudy mornings recently affected Oscar's decision to bloom?Is the=
re something [not expensive] I can do to usher the bloom?Some of you must b=
e botanists or plant knowledgeable.

Sound like Oscar really needs some friends...

I haven't grown peace lilies but I have several hundred other species
growing in my house.  Light, temperature, humidity & transplant shock
are all going to factor into answering your question.  A shot of fish
emulsion will jumpstart the flowering process but why not sit back &
enjoy a slow bloom.  Or set up a webcam & sell tickets.

This blue thunder and its
agonizing tributaries forks
before me when i
smoke my way home
Predictably it rains nasal stitches
on mary’s red umbrella
until I walk into a sign that says
no outlet
I wonder where
the ends of lines go
I didn’t mean to hurt anybody
Laughing the other
side of my nose
to garbage piled behind some
houses i see and of sudden
torrents land slowly easy
pouring down

This may open up some kind of debate about the politics of Venezuela, etc.,
but that's fine with me.  What I want to say is that the documentary my good
friends at the Global Women's Strike have produced and directed called
VENEZUELA:  JOURNEY WITH THE REVOLUTION, is very important.

It's been playing on Philadelphia PBS, and while I only use my television
for the news, THIS IS NEWS!  The importance of this documentary I feel is
that it shows you the people we only hear about, read about.

There are friends of mine in Philadelphia (one of them Cuban) who get into
screaming matches with me over Chavez and Venezuela's Bolivarian
Revolution.  What I've noticed is that their main argument is always that
I'm naive, I'm being lied to, I'm buying it.  And when my friend Mary
Kalayna of the Global Women's Strike went down to Venezuela last year for
the World Social Forum and I interviewed her about it, my friends who like
to get into screaming matches with me over this topic told me SHE WAS naive,
being lied to, etc.  And said too that Chavez probably MADE all the people
she spoke with say the things they did, to trick her, to lie and fool her.

Well, THIS documentary happens to be important BECAUSE if the Venezuelan
people in the film are acting, they should all win awards!  SEEING THESE
PEOPLE really seeing them, seeing their body language, seeing their care,
seeing how they are FEELING cared for, well, it's just nothing short of
infectious, that warmth, and I want it.

Seriously, I want it in my life, in your life, that system of care and
collective strength.

There is a scene in a soup kitchen / homeless shelter.  The people running
it make it clear that they DON'T want people to continue eating and living
there.  That the goal is to find out what happened to each
person brought them there, and to solve the problem, get them on their
feet.  Get them medicine if they need it, etc.  It's very complicated, the
jobs in the shelter, but the people working there seem to be dedicated and
motivated, and are making progress.  In Philadelphia I've spoken with people
who work in the shelters (a city where (I'm not making this up) one quarter
of the population lives below the poverty line) and they tell me (one of
these people is a coworker of mine) that it's almost impossible to get these
people on their feet and out into the world because the city is so
expensive, and jobs impossible to find, especially for some of these people
who are in the conditions they are in.  In Philadelphia it seems that the
shelter workers are doing the best they can with terrible resources, and can
only manage to maintain the situation, meaning they can't possibly invest in
progressing these people into new lives so much as they can just provide
food and shelter.

And in America, a country with the wealth we have it's shameful to see so
many people whose needs are not being met.

There is a young man being interviewed in the documentary who is a member of
the queer branch of the revolution, and it's AMAZING to see the T-shirt he's
wearing, which has a quote from Chavez's own mouth about how homosexuals ARE
part of the revolution, and important at that.  My president in my own
country has actually said that he thinks we queers are making a choice to be
queer.  So has presidential candidate Hillary Clinton.  Meanwhile here's
this man in Venezuela saying that IT'S VITAL to reach out immediately to
those most in need in the queer community, and that being the transgendered
people and the queers of African descent.  Wow!  That was beautiful to
hear!  And in Philadelphia when a black drag queen is murdered the police
write it off as an accident, literally do so, and move on.

There's another scene in a health clinic with a doctor that just blows my
mind, makes me so happy.  And another scene with Nora Castaneda, president
of the Women's National Bank who is behind the heart of the revolution
getting out to the poorest regions.  And the documentary points out that not
everyone has been helped yet, but shows how and where they have so far been
able to, and how and where to intend to go next and move everyone forward.
It's an amazing thing to see what that country was when American corporate
interests had control, and what it looks like now, and what they intend to
do next.  It's beautiful.

If you could make the effort to see this film you would give yourself the
opportunity to make clearer judgments about Venezuela, whether you feel good
or not about what's going on down there.

If you go to the PhillySound and scroll down, you'll soon see a post about
the documentary with links to the Global Women's Strike, etc., and there you
will be able to find a way to see the film.  I hope you do.  And I hope you
let others know about it.

This is important, very important, and thank you,
CAConrad

David Chirot, we poets who were going to read were NOT drunk until it was
clear we weren't reading.  The poet I mentioned, Janet Mason, who got
drunkest fastest wasn't a reader.

It became clear to me, and clearer and clearer that the woman running the
show wasn't going to let us read.  And I wasn't going to interfere with Will
Esposito's attempts to make this happen.  This was something he had worked
hard at, and was trying to get us up there, but was being shot down.  It
wasn't my place to get in the middle of that out of respect for my friend.
Also he wasn't asking for my help anyway.

After a little while it was pretty fucking clear we were getting the block
and the chop.  And WHY NOT party at that point!?  Oh, and I make it a point
to NOT drink until after I've read.

Besides, who says we can't give a fine reading with a few drinks under the
belt?

Oh, and when I say that the mic was disabled don't assume that wires were
unplugged.  This thing had been cut off from the other room, trust me.  This
gallery is a very sophisticated set up as it was the former home of the MTV
Philadelphia Real World Show. And what a bunch of assholes they were.  But,
my point being that that microphone was down and not about to go up.  But I
read a poem from the podium anyway, but the only ones who could hear it were
my other poet friends and only because they came in close.

Oh well,
CAConrad

Aren't the Cuban people friends of Venezuela?

That's a great article.

Sue Mingus' "Tonight at Noon" is an engrossing read, & Gene Santoro's bio
about Mingus, entitled "Myself When I Am Real," is fantastic. On a related
note, Vladimir Simosko & Barry Tepperman's "Eric Dolphy: A Musical Biography
& Discography" is also a great book. There's a story in there about a Mingus
Big Band concert, w/ Dolphy, at Ann Arbor's Once Festival, back in 1964. At
the end of the Bob James Trio's set, James threw a brick through a piece of
glass. Sounds like something Hugo Ball might've done.

Here's Mingus' lyric for "Fables of Faubus":

Oh, Lord, don't let 'em shoot us!
Oh, Lord, don't let 'em stab us!
Oh, Lord, don't let 'em tar and feather us!
Oh, Lord, no more swastikas!
Oh, Lord, no more Ku Klux Klan!

Name me someone who's ridiculous, Dannie.
Governor Faubus!
Why is he so sick and ridiculous?
He won't permit integrated schools.

Then he's a fool! Boo! Nazi Fascist supremists!
Boo! Ku Klux Klan (with your Jim Crow plan)

Name me a handful that's ridiculous, Dannie Richmond.
Faubus, Rockefeller, Eisenhower
Why are they so sick and ridiculous?

They brainwash and teach you hate.

Hey George, thank you for asking me to clarify that.  Well,
many Cuban-Americans don't like Castro.  My one friend who likes to scream
at me (she and I have a fine time!  it's all good, we laugh after it's over)
comes from that very brand of bourgeois family Castro kicked out of Cuba
and sent to Miami.  But yes the Cubans in Cuba are fast friends in a larger
political family kind of way with Venezuela.  Castro sent thousands of
doctors to Venezuela.  And the standing army in Venezuela actually works
(this is kind of incredible) hands-on in the deep rural villages, building
health clinics, soup kitchens, etc.

Just the other night Amy Goodman showed four young American women who had
graduated from medical school in Cuba, and they were SO AMAZING TO LISTEN TO
THESE WOMEN!  They were excited about coming back to the states to help the
poor!  OH MY GOD!  There are SO MANY medical students in the area where I
live and work and they're such assholes most of them.  It's like they use me
and other service industry folks as some kind of testing ground for their
future lives of shitting on other poeple.

By the way I'm not sold on Castro, nor his legacy.  He's done some pretty
fucked up things, as I'm sure we're all aware.  But Chavez, so far, seems to
mean what he says.  And I hope he continues to do so.

CA,I have liked most of what I have heard about Chavez, also.However, I'm just wondering if anyone can tell me more about claims that Chavez is closing off political dissent. From my perspective, that is almost always bad, but perhaps I am missing something. Or perhaps our media is only giving us a very small piece of the picture.
Thanks.

Hey George, thank you for asking me to clarify that.  Well,
many Cuban-Americans don't like Castro.  My one friend who likes to scream
at me (she and I have a fine time!  it's all good, we laugh after it's over)
comes from that very brand of bourgeois family Castro kicked out of Cuba
and sent to Miami.  But yes the Cubans in Cuba are fast friends in a larger
political family kind of way with Venezuela.  Castro sent thousands of
doctors to Venezuela.  And the standing army in Venezuela actually works
(this is kind of incredible) hands-on in the deep rural villages, building
health clinics, soup kitchens, etc.

Just the other night Amy Goodman showed four young American women who had
graduated from medical school in Cuba, and they were SO AMAZING TO LISTEN TO
THESE WOMEN!  They were excited about coming back to the states to help the
poor!  OH MY GOD!  There are SO MANY medical students in the area where I
live and work and they're such assholes most of them.  It's like they use me
and other service industry folks as some kind of testing ground for their
future lives of shitting on other poeple.

By the way I'm not sold on Castro, nor his legacy.  He's done some pretty
fucked up things, as I'm sure we're all aware.  But Chavez, so far, seems to
mean what he says.  And I hope he continues to do so.

I too am saddened by the death of Ingmar Bergman.  I have scenes from The Seventh Seal playing in my head right now.  No one made better films than he did both at his peak and after.  I saw many of them, including Sarabande, his last film, which was wonderful.  After he stopped making films, he returned to the theater.  Every couple of years, he brought his company to the Brooklyn Academy of Music.  I'm sorry I never saw any of their productions, particularly one of a play by Schiller.  Also, of course, his movie of The Magic Flute, probably the best film of an opera ever made.  Regards, Tom Savage

I often feel this way, too.  Still, literature or at least poetry keeps coming.  Whether from Brooklyn or the Lower East Side of Manhattan where I am located.  Somehow we transcend our surroundings partially by incorporating them with a certain detached perspective which both brings our environment closer to us but keeps it from overwhelming us as well.  It's almost a paradox that this happens but fortunately for us, it goes on regardless of what we may think about it. Anyone for a concurrence concussion rather than a fracture?

Thanks for the news.
  However, I have to say that, despite the fact that I want to like Chavez, I happen to know from a friend with 30+ years on a very small farm in Venezuela that Chavez is no hero nor are things improving at all for the average citizen despite the rhetoric.

  Best,
  Kimber

Yes, on reading the list of "five" Pasolini was who I thought about. And
Fellini was who I questioned. . .  in the long haul.

Myself, I'd keep Fellini for 8 1/2 and Satyricon, if I didn't need to
make room for Visconti. Godard and Kurosawa are givens. And if
limited to five (assuming we're talking about the post-Renoir
generations) I'd add Almodovar and Wenders. Never had much interest
in Bergman, tho his later films redeem the earlier ones for me.

Yep. Remember what happened during the flood of New Orleans?
Fidel offered to sent medical crews to help out.
Said he would send all their own food and housing,
no expense to the USA.

I expect that neither Fidel nor his allies are ideal critters.
But Cuba and Venezuela are certainly spearheading the current leftward
turn of
South America. I don't know, for example, how much the typical USA
newspaper
or television news will cover what is happening in Uruguay or Ecuador,
but Chavez is certainly one of the hopeful signs that Latin American
countries can start to
escape control by US military and industry.

Subject:      on our earth, the killdeer
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII; format=flowed

on our earth, the killdeer

we are on earth for such a shorttime, we have no more than a picture.
the picture is what we think of when we say, 'the way things are.'
just yesterday or tomorrow, something new, perhaps a bee.
the bee pollinates a flower shortly after our death.
there is a storm somewhere.
just now, i am beginning to understand the alarm calls of the killdeer.
the ghost of a shorebird, the feint, the run, the back and forth.
everything, everyone, lives in a different world.
i can say this because the image is always a sad image, the image is in
mourning for our death.

http://www.asondheim.org/killdeeralarm.mp3

like neural signals, the killdeer calls are a mix of analog and digital
phenomenology - their frequency is very narrow, and the repetitions of
standard (most likely territorial or display) calls are easily comprehen-
ded - at least they appear to be (the cry of the killdeer is easily iden-
tified) - on the other hand, there are temporal processes, non-standard
pitch and repetition, which present information, in this case alarm based
on distance, degree of threat, etc. - as far as i can tell - which means
nothing at all - on the sample you hear both calls and responses and the
changes within individual calls as well.

Although he has appeared in print since 1986, in 1991 David Baratier met th=
e
poet laureate of New York State, at which point the powers of poetry were
bestowed to him in a macabre ceremony. Shortly thereafter he became a full
time poet. Many believe his previous life is fiction. He and his fine lady
Rita, a former model, who has appeared in films such as Traffic, live in th=
e
deep south end of Columbus, Ohio, where his catty-corner neighbors ask to
mow his lawn nightly for $2. He has given featured readings at the Poetry
Project at St. Mark=B9s Church, University of Pittsburgh, DC Arts Center, and
Small Press Traffic, among others. He is the editor of Pavement Saw Press.
His poems are anthologized in American Poetry: the Next Generation (Carnegi=
e
Mellon University Press), Clockpunchers: Poetry of the American Workplace
(Partisan Press), Green Meanies (University of California Press), and Red,
White & Blues (University of Iowa Press). His poetry collections include A
Run of Letters (Poetry New York Press), The Fall Of Because (Pudding House)=

Dr. Benstock is a turntable duo, in the tradition of Christian Marclay and
Philip Jeck. Using Califone and PAC turntables and records found in
Salvation Army bins, turntablists John McDonough and Paul Spencer have
created a number of structured pieces, as well as improvisations,
referencing the entire universe of recorded music. At any given Benstock
performance one may hear the Clash, Berlioz, Sid Vicious, Frank Sinatra, Ar=
t
Blakey, Charles Mingus, Charles Nelson Reilly, Palestrina, self-hypnosis
instructions, Bach, Portuguese poetry, Penderecki, and Van Halen. These
records are mixed as a collage but never haphazardly. They are combined to
make unique compositions in their own right.
=20
Dr. Benstock has been together since 1992. They have played venues such as
ABC No Rio, the Pourhouse, Tonic, the Knitting Factory, SUNY-Stony Brook,
and Collective Unconscious in the N.Y.-metropolitan area, and Caf=E9 Koko in
Greenfield, Mass.
=20
**Tony Gloeggler
Tony Gloeggler was born, lived, lives, and expects to die in some part of
NYC. He manages a group home for developmentally disabled men in one of the
suddenly too cool parts of Brooklyn. His first chapbook, One On One, won th=
e
Pearl Poetry Prize, and Jane Street Press put out My Other Life. One Wish
Left (Pavement Saw Press) recently went into its second edition.

poetry, in 2006. He is an associate editor for Fulcrum Annual, printed
matter editor for Boog City, and teaches English at Kingsborough Community

=20
**The Leader
http://olivejuicemusic.com/theleader.html
The Leader rock out with the dynamic grace of two sonic gymnasts (in formal
attire). Careening through a thousand time signatures and pop genres,
bassist Julie DeLano and drummer Sam Lazzara reign supreme over the low end=
,
with suspenseful rhythmic patterns beneath wickedly clever melodies and
lyrics. It would be math rock if it weren't so soulful =8A yeah.
=20
**Rachel Lipson
http://www.rachellipson.org
http://www.myspace.com/rachellipson
Rachel Lipson is a Brooklyn-based songwriter who performs her simple, hones=
t
songs on guitar, ukulele and banjo. Born near Detroit, she spent her
childhood building forts with her brother and sister in the living room,
contemplating the dangers of the dark and pizza deliverers, riding horses
and playing with friends. Rachel first picked up a guitar at age 16 and a
few years later, after having moved to New York, began crafting the songs
that would make up her first album, This Way, which she self-released the
next year.
=20
In 2003 Rachel released a 7" with Rough Trade recording artist Jeffrey
Lewis, on Holland's Nowhere Fast record label and self-released her second
album Some More Songs. She toured Europe for seven weeks with Lewis and
Herman D=FCne in the summer, including the Mofo festival in Paris in July. In
the fall, Rachel recorded a new album at Olive Juice Studios in New York fo=
r
the forthcoming release Pastures on Meccico Records, a U.K. label founded
and run by members of Cornershop. Rachel is returning to the studio to
record the first album of her side project, The Scruffles, with bandmate
Jeffrey Lewis.
=20
In the last few years, Rachel has collaborated and performed extensively
with Leah Hayes (of La Laque and Scary Mansion), Herman D=FCne, and others.
She has also played alongside Eugene Chadbourne, Kimya Dawson, Daniel
Johnston, The Mountain Goats, and Refrigerator, as well as twice performing
live on WFMU in New Jersey and on WNYC, a division of NPR.
=20
Rachel Lipson's music combines a sort of radical simplicity and honesty wit=
h
intricately woven narratives. The lyrics seem to have as much to do with
William Faulkner as they do with Woody Guthrie. The music recalls the
earliest folk traditions and yet speaks at the same time to a contemporary
minimal aesthetic. While sometimes the approach is blindingly direct and at
others masterfully oblique, the overall effect is irresistible, one of
invitingly gentle beauty and clarity. (Biography by Blue Bomber Press)
=20
**Nan and the Charley Horses
http://www.olivejuicemusic.com/nan.html
http://www.myspace.com/nanturner
Vocally, she's the missing link between Kathleen Hanna and Juliana Hatfield=
,
with a wail matched only by her whisper. The Lucy Ricardo of indie rock, he=
r
zany, goof-ball spirit is cut only by the fierce sexuality of her drumming
style (see Schwervon!). Raised on the outskirts of Olympia, Nan was studyin=
g
theater when the riot grrrl movement seduced her into a life of rock =B9n'
roll. After several years with the power-pop girl band Bionic Finger, Nan
went solo with her jangly, eclectic EP Leg Out, but her one-woman act soon
morphed into the all-girl Pantsuit. After touring the U.K. with their
French-released The Path From the House to the Lawn, Pantsuit has
established itself as a virtual gland of playful melodies, moody sounds, an=
d
old-school feminist ferocity.
=20
Presently, Nan is writing songs on keys and guitar and experimenting live
with a rotating cast of musicians she has coined the One Night Stands. Her
new EP, For Champs and Losers, Version 1, is out now on Olive Juice Music.
=20
**The Passenger Pigeons
http://myspace.com/rachelandrew
Andrew Phillip Tipton met Rachel Talentino in Savannah while working at The
Gap. A common love for catchy melodies, Carole King, and boys led them to
Brooklyn. As The Passenger Pigeons (n=E9 The Sparrows), Andrew and Rachel mak=
e
up the cutest anti-folk duo around! Simple and lovely.
=20
**Lauren Russell
Lauren Russell is now at the mercy of an idiopathic need to enter language
and manipulate it. Her poetry has appeared in Boog City, The Recluse, and
Van Gogh's Ear, among others. She is writing an experimental novella.

**The Actual Feelings
The Actual Feelings are an assemblage of egos, chopped separately and throw=
n
together to make a tasty gazpacho. Their ingredient list is elastic. For
this Fugs tribute they will most likely consist of Steve Espinola, Debby
Schwartz, Heather Hoover, Andy Gilchrist, Erica Simonian, Andrew Rohn, and
Catherine Capellero, with some cilantro, tomatoes, and peppers. The Actual
Feelings manifesto calls for the immediate release of the complete 1965 Fug=
s
sessions, including, but not limited to, the out-of-print recordings once
found on Virgin Fugs, Fugs Four Rounders Score, and the alternate,
primitive, Broadside LP release of The Village Fugs. The Actual Feelings
have yet to hear the song "Bull Tongue Clit" and need to at once.
=20
**Paul Cama
Paul Cama started to play drums at 14, performing all kinds of music from
jazz to blues to pop. He plays jazz in a big band in St. James. He was in
the folk rock Americana band Nylon & Steel from 1989-1997. They released th=
e
album Slip Behind the Molecule in 1995. Cama also is a singer-songwriter
guitarist and occasionally play solo gigs. He is playing drums in the impro=

vintage films in the tradition of silent movies. They will be releasing
their first full-length DVD/CD later this year.

has gone through a lot of changes through the past couple of years, but one
thing that will never change is their love for the rock. Not Rock & Roll,
but crack rock. So far, Huggabroomstik has been content playing shows in an=
d
around NYC, but they dream of making it all the way to Nashville.

This is odd, but this posting made me think yet again of something
troubling. I knew about the bees dying off in such numbers...last I checked  there were
several theories, none of them proven...(anyone know if that's been
convincingly explained yet? did i miss sequelae?)  and have empirically  witnessed
this scarcity...but I've been spooked because we've had no lightning  bugs all
summer...I am East Coast....Pennsylvania...they're usually lighting the
neighborhood up every two seconds...anybody hear anything about this? I'm  near a
river and a stadium (a few miles upriver) and I know they spray  the river area
for mosquitos and such, but in past years no lightning bug  (or glowworms as
some call 'em) effect was seen...maybe it's just in this  area...are your lawns
lighting up?

Diane Di Prima voted for Pasolini too.

	Pasolini could indeed displace anyone from the list, perhaps Godard.
He was a good poet too which leaves me a soft spot. Same stands true for
Tarkovsky. In fact, Bergman at some point in his career expressed deep
admiration for him, saying something like cinema didn't exist without
Tarkovsky. Kurosawa said the same about Ray. One could profess to include
Antonioni too. There are other greats who had a much shortlived career.

The body of work, its richness, topical range, the power to create brilliant
human documents, the courage to experiment with the apparatus and the craft,
the condition in which they made films - all these factors counted for my
Magic 5.

	It requires a lot of guts to discount someone like Ray. If you've
seen "The Chess Players" (Shatranj ki Khilari) or "The Lonely Wife"
(Charulata) or "The Hero" (Nayak) you'd know. What makes him even greater is
the aspect ratio (defined as the ratio of the final footage to the initial
amount shot) of his films. He maintained an aspect ratio of 8 over his
entire film career. This means for every 8 feet of film he shot, 1 foot made
it into the final cut. That's the lowest aspect ratio one could think of
when it comes to the acclaimed. Kurosawa had a ratio of 400, Hitchcock 265,
let's not even try to think of Spielberg. Even the Nouvelle Vague directors
who stood for cheap film-making couldn't even dream of making such small
budget films. Ray was a gifted commercial artist and used that skill to
prepare detailed drawings of every single frame, every single movement
within the frame. He was a perfectionist who would sometimes rehearse his
artists for about 20-25 times because they couldn't get some Bengali or
English accent correct. He was an exceedingly talented musician and composed
his own music. In many of his films he wrote the story, the screenplays,
dialogs, did the casting himself, wrote and composed the music, designed
sets/garments and finally directed the film. I don't know of any other film
director who managed so much himself.

	Truffaut, back in 1956 at the Cannes film festival made a statement
which he might have felt really sorry about for the rest of his life. He
tried his very best to swallow his once spoken words. He left the theatre in
the middle of the screening of Ray's "Song of the Little Road" saying, " I
have no interest in the life of an Indian farmer".

	As for Fellini, I would emphatically argue if Satryicon was his best
film. How could we forget La Dolce Vita, 8-and-a-half, La Strada, Ginger and
Fred! I thought very few handled the modern classic narrative like him. Very
few wrote a human document like Fellini or Ray or Kurosawa.

	We all have our own favorites but all of my magic 5 are "high",
really "high". They can be displaced but not discounted.

	Anyway, here we are to remember Ingmar Bergman, an equally stunning
artist.

sure. maybe we could do a POETICS TOP-12 or TOP-15 when all the raised hands
have been counted. no has said - Truffaut by far! Or Eisenstein (maybe not
Kalatozov for his low low turn over). and as poets, how could we forget
Jean Cocteau ? Or Alain Resnais.

The thing with Fellini is this: my parents know shit about art, but whe it =
comes to Fellini, they equate his films with their daily lives (they're for=
eigners). It's the only thing they can relate to with me. I think Fellini t=
ook the absurd, the extravagent, and made it my parents'.

I'm from Kingston (Wilkes-Barre area) and we've noticed the same thing on
and off - but then they return. In our area the rabbits, skunks, and
possums have disappeared; herons have increased, as have certain kinds of
spiders. I think at least to some extent this might have to do with global
warming, but I'm not certain. - Alan

you guys forgot Antonioni, and now he's dead...=20

died on the same day as Bergman -- so why did the news media hold off
reporting it?



NYT * July 31, 2007
Michelangelo Antonioni, 94, Italian Director, Dies
By RICK LYMAN

Michelangelo Antonioni, the Italian director whose chilly canticles of
alienation were cornerstones of international filmmaking in the 1960s,
inspiring intense measures of admiration, denunciation and confusion,
died on Monday at his home in Rome, Italian news media reported today.
He was 94. He died on the same day as Ingmar Bergman, the Swedish
filmmaker who died at his home in Sweden earlier Monday.

"With Antonioni, not only has one of the greatest living directors been
lost, but also a master of the modern screen," said the mayor of Rome,
Walter Veltroni. His office said it was making plans for Mr. Antonioni's
body to lie in state on Wednesday, Reuters reported.

Tall, cerebral and resolutely serious, Mr. Antonioni harkens back to a
time in the middle of the last century when cinema-going was an
intellectual pursuit, when purposely opaque passages in famously
difficult films spurred long nights of smoky argument at sidewalk cafes,
and when fashionable directors like Mr. Antonioni, Alain Resnais and
Jean-Luc Godard were chased down the Cannes waterfront by
camera-wielding cineastes demanding to know what on earth they meant by
their latest outrage.

Mr. Antonioni is probably best known for "Blow-Up," a 1966 drama set in
Swinging London about a fashion photographer who comes to believe that a
photograph he took of two lovers in a public park also shows, hidden in
the background, evidence of a murder. But his true, lasting contribution
to cinema resides in an earlier trilogy - "L'Avventura" in 1959, "La
Notte" in 1960 and "L'Eclisse" in 1962 - which explores the filmmaker's
tormented central vision that people had become emotionally unglued from
one another.

Why are we playing a numbers game instead of discussing Bergman?  For the record (?), any list of great filmmakers without Renoir and Carne is woefully incomplete.  Anyway, of the postwar generation, a new death has to be recorded today.  Michelangelo Antonioni died early today or yesterday.  The last film I saw of his, called Passenger or The Passenger, was wonderful.  Regards, Tom Savage

my friend Jennifer Mulligan will be in New York from the evening of August

consider going to?

i'll probably send her with some above/ground press publications for

LOL...those are great! Reminds me of the uproar the candy cigarettes caused in years past. At first, I thought it was going to be some bad taste?thing where they only released books by authors who died of lung disease or something...like we'd see ray carver, thomas bernhard, etc....although maybe it's a marlboro "manly man thing" since i see ernest hemingway, joseph conrad...but i think their mommas had em both in dresses when they wuz little, no?

I was just in Alabama and saw enough lightning bugs to warm my heart and cause my four year old son's eyes to widen as we captured a few of them in jars.

  As for killdeer, I know nothing other than one made an appearance in a recent poem of mine.

  As for the bee death, CCD, colony collapse disease, is a new phenom.  We have only recently begun commercial beekeeping at such a rate.  So, we don't really have enough data to know one way or the other.  I have several friends who study bees; they are not alarmed.  We have exchanged some e-mails about it.  Here are some highlights of recent news stories.

  rest assured:

  A 13-year-old's award-winning essay suggests the die-off comes from feeding them too much corn syrup and trucking them long distances to pollinate crops

  Researchers puzzled at the sudden drop of honeybees

  But with the discovery of a 100-million year old bee, I seriously doubt that humans could have a lasting impact on the bee:
  http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2006/12/061209083342.htm

  However, if it meant giving up cell phones, which would go first, the phone or the bee?

  Of more concern, I read that global warming will bring a decline in human males.

  A good place to end this message.

I was not clear and I apologize. I put Man Ray into doubt because he is an
artist par excellence for me, and that could go even beyond cinematography.
Why not Pasolini as well? Because for me his cinema is better than his
writings and his paintings.

On a second thought I do not like that "beyond." What I might use is
"distinct from" cinematography. His versatility tended more towards the arts
rather than cinema tout court. This is the way I see Man Ray, probably not
as you do.

Swedish daily Dagens Nyheter had a special today about Ingmar
Bergman, with two of the articles translated into English. One is
written by one of Sweden's more prominent theater critics, Leif Zern:

Love and Daemons
See http://www.dn.se/DNet/jsp/polopoly.jsp?d=2712&a=675578

Then there is an article by the Bergman biographer Maaret Koskinen:

Death has wrapped its large mantle around Bergman
See http://www.dn.se/DNet/jsp/polopoly.jsp?d=2712&a=675560

Many have emphasized Bergman's visual genius (achieved in
co-operation with Sven Nyqkist) and his great interest in music, and
that his greatest love actually was the theater, not film - but I
think one aspect that is seldom mentioned is the special rhetoric,
the very special verbal flow articulated through his actors, e.g.
Erland Josephson and Gunnar Bjornstrand, and of course Max von Sydow.
But also the famous "Bergman women" sometimes excel in these almost
breathless verbal outbursts.

There is a similarity here with another Swedish director, Hasse
Ekman, who also had a very special talent for a sort of smooth
eloquence, but Bergman's characters (think  Erland Josephson in
"Scenes From a Marriage") are mostly ironic, sarcastic, bitter or
just lost in this world, while Ekman was always elegant and made even
misery seem somehow endurable through his mere voice and timbre.

I think this use of voices and voice quality together with often very
non-oral literary utterances have not attracted as much attention as
I think they should. Bergman used his actors as a composer chooses
instruments for a piece of music. Somebody wrote the other day that
Bergman managed to deal with all these existential topics without
being pretentious. I think he was very pretentious - but he got away
with it beautifully, partly I believe through this very special use
of certain actors and their marvellous, not to say idiosyncratic,
diction.

John Cassavettes, yes!   Someone already wrote Akria Kurosawa, yes?

  Anything Krystof Kieslowski.

  Dare I throw Chris Marker into the mix?  And Wim Wenders?

Here's my son Zon's photos of a baby killdeer that's living on the
roof of our old school.  Still doing fine despite hawks & owls
everywhere.  These were just shot a few weeks ago.

As for bees, here in the organic world, I know of almost no one who

is not true for the big commercial growers who truck semi loads of
bees across the country...

Rupert Murdock has absorbed The Wall Street Journal into his polymorphic media conglomerate.  Let's see ...

I can hardly contain my glee --
open the Journal; on page three
to my great surprise --
in front of my eyes --
Anna Coulter au naturally!

Incidentally, can we stop the filmamker count before we start listing James Whale and Roger Corman (both of whom I admire, ok we can see how this gets silly).

I just watched L'ECLISSE for the 5th time (I wrote a piece on it; be =20
out soon), but love the inexplicable actions of THE PASSENGER and =20
L'AVVENTURA.

Haven't watched Bergman since last year (AUTUMN SONATA); will return to =20=

him, "my first film love".  I think PERSONA was the first I saw of his, =20=

at the Brattle Theater in Cambridge, MA.  My film school.  I remember =20=

one particular evening, at the end of a failed love affair that hadn't =20=

quite ended, I watched three Bergman films (WILD STRAWBERRIES was one) =20=

in a row.  But sadly, I've always attempted to watch THE SEVENTH SEAL =20=

late at night, and I've always fallen asleep.  He taught me about =20
light, dark, silence and the layered frame (I think someone said =20
something about his depth of field, or some suchness).

Bergman's women...and Woody Allen's, Godard's, Cassavetes', Fellini's, =20=

etc...it's more than amazing, what these women have done for film, in =20=

film,  made visible, palpable...in an expression of the inexpressible =20=

(to quote Blonde Redhead, a propos a Vitti), from director to actor.  =20=

didn't a book on Monica Vitti just come out?  I remember reading a =20
review in BookForum, I think.

My "Indelible Imagemakers" list, in no order, hella long, and really, =20=

it could change tomorrow, and well it should; there are at least 20 =20
filmmakers for my every mood.  As for the top whatever, and voting, =20
etc?  Not interested.  I'll leave that to some academy.  These folks' =20=

works haunt, mark, stay with me, and I keep returning, seeking them out =20=

for more:

Antonioni
Bergman
Jean-Pierre Melville
Alain Resnais
Renoir
Fellini
Almodovar
Kubrick
Godard
Kurosawa
Cassavetes
Sembene Ousmane (died last month; was also a novelist)
Bela Tarr
Coppola
Ozu
Jacques Rivette
Billy Wilder
Charles Burnett (and not just for KILLER OF SHEEP)
Satyajit Ray
Flora Gomes (and all the overlooked "African New Wave" filmmakers of =20
the late 80s -early 90s, along with the "Hong Kong New Wave")
Otto Preminger
Shohei Imamura
Tsai Ming Liang
Chris Marker (I dare!)
Scorcese
Luchino Visconti
Stanley Kwan
Claire Denis
Oscar Micheaux
George Cukor
Chantal Akerman
Nancy Savoca
Fassbinder
Spike Lee
John Sayles
Apichatpong Weerasethakul  (let's see, 10 years from now, what's up)
Tarkovsky
Agnes Varda

It's all so intertextual!  That's what makes the ongoing conversation =20=

of cinema so interesting to me.  And why the list, really, means =20
nothing.  But I couldn't help it!

About to watch Pasolini's MAMA ROMA, and Theo Angelopoulos' THE WEEPING =20=

MEADOW; some buyer's on point at the Brooklyn Public Library.  I also =20=

really liked Bertolucci's BEFORE THE REVOLUTION.

Peace and light to the spirits of Igmar Bergman and Antonioni as they =20=

pass through this world to the next, and much thanks to them for =20
leaving so much of themselves, and their vision, with us.

Prose is like a window; fiction is like a door.
But it is not uncommon that he who should come in through the door
jumps in through the window.

I've seen a surprising amount of lightning bugs in Chicago this
summer. And Chicago has been unaffected by the bee colony collapses
which I gather has been a problem in other parts of the country.

So, we don't really have enough data to know one way or the other.  I have several friends who study bees; they are not alarmed.  We have exchanged some e-mails about it.  Here are some highlights of recent news stories.
