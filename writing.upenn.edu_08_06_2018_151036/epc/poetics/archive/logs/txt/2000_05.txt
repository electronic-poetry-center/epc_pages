Subject:      Eloquence, a ramble
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

I've been enjoying this thread on eloquence, though I admit to frequently
resorting to exhausted rapid late night skimming of the list writings,
always promising myself I will get back to a more thorough read someday
(knowing all this is documented makes such rationalizations easier,
although it is good to remember that while later reviewing is possible,over
time it seems less and less likely). So to say something right now... Some
poets and artists I know claim to be avoiding eloquence, (or was it
elegance?) but lets face it, anyone can resort to it at moments when
convincing and attracting others to one's arguments or ideas seems
necessary. It is hard to imagine eloquence in our period without at least a
trace of irony or self-effacement. I've found edifying what some have said
on this list recently about 1st and 2cd generation New York school poets in
regards to eloquence. I am thinking aloud here, and I've already apologized
for my waning late night energies, but may I ask the question if it is
possible to be funny and eloquent at the same time? Perhaps this is what is
meant, or was once,meant by "wit." But such moments are rare and brief,
under any circumstances.There is, of course, a lot of humor in Ted
Berrigan's poetry ,but always a litttle bit of eloquence beautifully braced
by humor, as in Sonnet XLIV: "The withered leaves fly higher than dolls can
see    A watchdog barks in the night   Joyful ants nest in the roof of my
tree   There is only off-white mescaline to be had"  Anyway, I've been
wondering when I would feel impelled to jump into this fizzy thread, and Mr
William Austin's comments about Derrida and Freud have done it. Hear, hear!
True, I get a bit sleepy now trying to read Derrida's latest book on
"resistance"(not Freud, for professional reasons) but, come on, who wasn't
more than a little impressed by Derrida's early writing about Husserl, or
for the matter,at least some of the Grammatology? O.k., everything wilts a
bit after 30 or more years, even Roland Barthes. So, maybe it isn't  only
anti-intellectualism in this case (though I agree with Mr. Austin that
there is plenty of that here in US-land) perhaps it is also that a steady
exposure to someone's eloquence over a long period of time, say that of
Jacques Derrida,brings about a need for a reaction with some sarcasm or
humor as a brace, or distancing mechanism to allow fresh ideas some space
to breathe. But why try to eliminate one by means of the other? As William
Austin implies,this may be the reflex of fashion, not necessarily sound
critique.

Very best wishes,
Nick Piombino

 One of the most enfuriating rules is the
prohibition against paraphrase.  In other words, all paraphrases of
Derrida's thought that detractors (and even defenders)  come up with are
said to be simplifications, or caricatures.  This may be true in many
cases! But part of intellectual argumentation is the ability to say "so
what you are saying is that..." etc...  You can do this profitably with
Wittgenstein but not with Heidegger or Derrida.
endquote

In that one definition of a random sequence is that it cannot be expressed
by any sequence shorter than the original, this interesting prohibition
suggests that Derrida's texts are random. Those hundred thousand monkeys
better look to diversifying.

I don't particularly like this definition in that it does not address the
question of the process by which the sequence is arrived at, i.e. 1, 1, 1,
1, 1, 1,  etc. by this light is non-random, yet it is conceivable that the
sequence could represent throws of a die. And whether the throw of a die is
random is ...

PART ONE
        that's quite an apt  phrase:  "the rhetorical simulation
of a lack
of
eloquence"

        a common saying in Northern New England:

        "don't speak unless you improve on silence"

PART TWO:

        (which sadly betrays the promise of the last line of Part One)

        (btw: "rhetorical simulation of a lack of eloquence" brings to
mind Method Acting--the "inarticulate" roles of Brando, Dean
etc--contrasted to/with the earlier proto-Method of Montgomery Clift, who
for a variety of reasons, cut his lines--prompting one writer to
pronounce:  "Montgomery Clift uses silence like no other actor")

        Jonathan Mayhew makes a very interesting point re the "rhetorical
simulation of a lack of eloquence"
        that is, he reminds of that, for many,  hoary old spectre of the
"authentic"
        (which, if one is to assume there are simulations, presumes an
        original)
        there is a difference between Gandhi fasting, and the millions who
starve without choice
        Gandhi did fast to call attention to the starving, and that in
turn is different from one who diets, and so on, into the hall
of mirrors of simulations
        (still, millions starve)


        it brought to mind the fate of two friends during the Vietnam War
        Era

        One, a very articulate and bi-lingual sculptor, who was obsessed
by the idea that painters/sculptors are thought of as inarticulate, when
drafted decided to try an old Mafia trick:  to feign insanity.
        (Note:  in french there is a phrase, "bete comme un peintre".
Marcel Duchamp once remarked in an interview that his work was driven by
wanting to make a refutation to this phrase, "stupid like a
painter".Stupid implying a lack of verbal eloquence, an inarticulateness
in the face of xprssing ideas.)
        My friend ended up spending months under psychiatric observation,
living
on chewed
newspapers and howling a quasi-Artaud speech until he actually nearly did
go mad.
        Fortunately, he was released and returned to his art work.
        Later he wrote poetry in a loosely structured invented language,
though for this he still used the Roman alphabet.
        He also made thousands of drawings of small forms suggestive of a
script from an unknown language.

        The other friend, a sanitation worker and truck driver, who was in
fact inarticulate--he had trouble framing his words-- and stuttered when
excited, was drafted and reported for
testing, physicals and so on.
                When the test results came back a week later, my friend
was insensed.
        The army had determined that he was deaf.
        He was classified 4F.
        Instead of being relieved, my friend was furious with the army.
        "Stupid ********!"
        Apparently, during the hering test, drftees wer to listen for a
sound, and upon hearing it, press a button that they had, and another if
they had not.
        My friend had gotten the directions confused and pressed the
button for have not each time he heard a sound.

        In the Kurosawa film The Hidden Fortress, a hunted princess is
disguised as a mute peasant.
        The two fools who are part of the wanted party are discussing,
while the leader--Toshiro Mifune--is away,  stealing her animal carrying a
concealed load of gold.
        The two men are speaking nervously in hushed tones.
        One of them suddenly realizes this and says they may speak freely.
        The other asks why.
        His companion replies  "People who can't speak can't hear".

        From the back row, a hand goes up and a voice asks:
        "Do people who rhetorically simulate a lack of eloquence
rhetorically simulate a lack of hearing?"

PART THREE

        (if we are to have a syllogism, or an Hegelian synthesis)

        a poem by Bob Cobbing, from the collection bob jubile (New River
Project:  London, 1990  "texts selected by bob cobbing & jennifer pike")

        IF HE KNEW WHAT HE WAS DOING, HE WOULD DO IT BETTER!

        Sockless in sandals,
        gibbering his wares
        in unintelligible shrieks and hisses,
        a "poet" merely disrupts
        the solid, sensible business
        of the night.

        the people hear gibberish;
        Poets !   how can nothing be said
        with all that noise ?

geez, carolyn---a question i can answer, i think, though i'm not on a
hiring committee... i make it a policy to make such matters public...

i started here last fall at u of colorado at boulder at $42K annually... i
think full-time non-tenured lecturers might make around $30K (not sure yet,
and i'm not sure whether they teach a 3/3---i'm on the enviable 2/2)...
adjuncts in english are being paid $4K per course...

best,

I made tapes of all the panels - the readings didn't run through a PA board,
so our rather crude recording setup wasn't up to the task. But there's
something like three hours worth of panel presentations and discussion. I'll
be bringing up availability and reproductions at our board meeting this
weekend, and I'll be sure to let everyone know what the status of the tapes
is as soon as the board (and the participating writers - I'm sure we'd like
to get permission) comes to a decision.

Thanks to Maria and Aldon and the others who have posted to the list or
backchanneled with this question. It's gratifying to see this level of
interest out there in what was said.

All best,
Taylor

Dear Bay Area Listpersons,

  I've been appointed writer-in-residence in CCAC's new MFA program for the
2000-
2001 academic year. I'll be commuting weekly from San Diego. Most weeks I
expect to be in the Bay Area Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday nights. I'm
interested in renting a studio apartment, a "mother-in-law" cottage, or even
a room in someone's
house. I'm aware that rents in the Bay are astronomical now - but I can only
pay up to around $750 per month. I may be able to get into visiting faculty
housing starting in January - but I need to line something up for the time
from late August to mid-December. If you think you may know of something in
Oakland, Berkeley, Albany or San Francisco, please please contact me.

Yours sincerely,

  Rae Armantrout

Thank you.  That's Entertainment...and That's informative.

It could only be topped by the interview he gave Jim Lerher ( I almost said
Tom) on last night's NEWSHOUR...where he spoke about "faith-based
partnerships", ones having "nothing to do with the separation of church and
state".

Bst,

"open the gates".
.
.
open the gates, characterizes the phenomenology.
tear down the gateposts: i am sick, stumbling.
fill the postholes; there are signs and fields.
erase the signs - now space stumbles into space.
space is gone space, suddenly, nikuko and izanagi.
do not fear, they say, things will soon be halted.
wider and wider, there is no language for this.
memory loses itself; beyond memory, memory.
beyond loss, loss: that tiny little thing..
of the darkest thing, encode, replies izanagi.
of the darkest, coding, says nikuko.
code heaving, its cunt thrust open.
izanagi goes away, nikuko brings signs to humans.
time takes signs away.

I think this is right on, Steve, and very nicely put. The idea of a
_parallel_ subject, we can see that in lots of poems, as you say, and it
might be worthwhile figuring out exactly how that works. Probably a lot of
our favorite poems do this. You know what particularly irked me about
Perelman's sloppiness here (& he does better elsewhere in this book) was
the singling out of one element in the scene described in this poem and
identifying it (projecting an act of identification onto WCW, that is) with
a single element of Williams' poetry. That's what I tried especially to
mock in my first post. It's just cheating to apply an interpretative rule
so selectively, skip over everything in the poem you don't have a ready
analogue for in the poetry, not bothering to see what in the poetry (poetry
being the hidden subject) really ought to be represented, etc. Bad
technique. Of course, there will be the odd hit because sometimes the
writer will just cram in something having in mind some particular extra
content picked up this way, so there will be a little part of the work that
does follow a different scheme of representation from the rest. This is
exactly _not_ the kind of poem you're talking about Steve. At least it
seems to me you're describing a doubling that takes in the whole work, and
thus can't be isolated say to a single word doing double-duty. And if we
like these kind of double poems particularly, we might raise some doubt
about the other pile-it-on method, and that makes Perelman's "method" here,
the simple-minded overinterpretation of individual elements, especially
troubling since it can only pick up the weaker less interesting way of
doubling content.

I think it would be really helpful to understand how the parallel subject
is suggested & how understood because an awful lot of poetry these days
seems to be written to achieve this effect but also muting or obscuring (or
effacing or putting _sous rature_ ;-) the "primary" subject, so that you
have only suggested content. Which I guess is also in a similar way
obscured or effaced. Maybe this is related to other indirect methods, I'm
not sure & I'd rather not jump the gun. In some ways this reminds me of
Hemingway (read a lot of Hemingway just last year & it turns out he's a
hell of a writer), and maybe Hemingway as a sort-of ultra-flaubert, but
anyway his deliberate presentation of externals all geared to giving you an
experience of the internals, if you know what I mean. (And of course Papa's
poetics is explicitly based on erasure, knowing what to leave out.) _The
Sun Also Rises_ is pretty remarkable in this respect: you go along, we went
to the hotel, we had dinner, we went back to the hotel, we went to the bar,
we went to lunch, we went to the bar, on & on like this but then gradually
in the second half or maybe the last third of the novel you realize
something is happening, and you can really fel the buildup of emotion to
the big scenes, and all that. I thought it was pretty remarkable. Now--
this is very different from the poet/roofer kind of thing, but I wonder if
there is some technical similarity. (And of course the Williams written
around the same time more-or-less and without a similar camera-like
directness & absence of explicit editorializing, so in fact "Fine Work ..."
might just be an oddly hemingwayish poem & to that degree not esp.
characteristic, I dunno. Anybody talk much about Hemingway & Imagism?)

More fruitful than any of that is your idea of _enactment_, and I'd rather
understand more about how that works than just about anything probably. We
do largely know it when we feel it, I think, and maybe that's about all
we'll ever know. Thanks, Steve

Pat

This I like: my name TWICED into a Subject-Header.  The spelling of
TWICED was a mistake I'm keeping.

Nice to know Guy got work in your publication.  And that you agreeze
with just about everything I said.  I agree back with the possibility
that standard mainstream narrative can, at its best, equal almost
anything else in poetry.  The problem is all the people in positions
of surface power that believe that's the only kind of poetry out
there, except retrograde neo-formalism, and over-hermetic langpo.

Meanwhile, here's an update on Kostelanetz's Dictionary of the
Avant-Gardes--with my apologies for mentioning it to everybody,
apparently, at this discussion group except you and David Chirot, and
maybe one or two others: Amazon finally has it properly priced at $75.
That shouldn't be out of the reach of your local library, folks.

Following the threads here on poetry criticism; read Kristin's piece with
interest.

Just recently I published a negative review of Linda Gregg's new book; it
took a certain amount of courage, I think, to do so, since it's always
easier to be caught liking something bad than to not recognize something
good. Additionally, if you write a bad review, the people who will
(inevitably) disagree will take it personally, not to mention the poet
herself (not that Gregg will care about what I write.)

Why can people be so receptive to criticism "face to face" (either in a
workshop-esque situation, or in a personal interaction) but have so many
problems with negative reviews? Partly, I think, it stems from the
publicity of such an endeavor.

Given that so many critics are poets themselves, or people who, as Kristin
puts it, are interested in socializing with poets, what can we do to
recreate the "disinterested" state of mind that allows for criticism to
proceed accuretely?

I'm not sure that we need to highlight the presence of culture or school
in criticism (doing so with Gregg, someone who's lived pretty well outside
the mainstream in any sense of the word, would have been fruitless.) It
seems to me that what's more important is freeing the critic to take
whatever tack seems necessary in the case of a particular poet.

Perhaps anonymous review? I envision a system by which identities of
reviews are kept in escrow from all concerned (the publishers of the
journal in question as well as the reading audience -- it wouldn't be too
hard to have the computer itself check whether or not the reviewer was
reviewing himself.) Would this eliminate some of the problems in question
and allow us to focus on other issues?

Such a system works in the scientific world (anonymous peer review.)
Would it work in the poetry world?

Aldon's right -- fashion is a poor of index for determining what one ought
to read or not. Rumors of Derrida's demise are greatly exaggerated anyhow,
driven by the same avaricious trendiness that vaulted him to the top of
academic reading lists. The work will survive, no matter. This reaction
seems to me aimed more at the pieties erected around portions of his early
work by the Yale Decons et al. The later Derrida fully merits attention  --
and is receiving it in a very engaging way from such interlocutors as John
Caputo, for one.

DOUGLAS OLIVER (1937-2000)

THE WORK of the poet Douglas Oliver remains an anomaly in late 20th-century=
 English poetry. Spanning 35 years, it reveals a contrary nature; erudite,=
 self-taught and dignified, defiantly old-fashioned if not Blimpish. He was=
 a poet, but no less a novelist; lecturer, journalist and translator -=
 exilic researcher, inventor of forms. His writings investigated the=
 instability of language, pitched against the language of political and=
 social upheaval, grief and human vulnerability. While possessing an English=
 register, often formal, his poetry works in larger contexts. The Infant and=
 the Pearl (1985), his most celebrated poem, satirised the reductive values=
 of Thatcherism.

She was wearing
a pearly suit, not silver-rose
pink, since sadly we seemed to be sharing
a black and white world. But the bearing
of the front passenger meant a man for
the media
to deal with delicately: a Joseph for
dreaming
and descrying dreams in the eye of his
leader.

Oliver was born in 1937, in Southampton, and brought up in Branksome, next=
 to Bournemouth, the youngest of three children. His Glaswegian father was=
 an insurance manager. Home was Browning Avenue, a dilapidated 19th-century=
 cliffside estate built for Sir Percy Shelley, son of the poet. Robert Louis=
 Stevenson, who wrote Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde in Bournemouth in the 1880s,=
 became one of Oliver's heroes, an instructor in "how to wrestle with the=
 presbyterian background in a way which restores honour to the parents".=
 Stevenson's house (Shelley's manor), King's Park, where Douglas and his=
 brother Brian watched boxing matches, and Christchurch harbour, where he=
 studied sea and shore birds, were childhood haunts. The immediacy of=
 childhood never left one, he believed, and was used by boxers, priests and=
 politicians to gain power over their opponents' identity. He researched=
 such vocations avidly; they were his prey but he was also subject to them.=
 Bournemouth School, a grammar, was not happy for him and he did not stay=
 beyond O levels. Following National Service as an RAF accountant, he went=
 into journalism, first in Coventry, then in Cambridge, where he became a=
 staff reporter on the Cambridge Evening News. His first wife, Janet Hughes,=
 a primary schoolteacher, whom he married in 1962, is memorialised in the=
 opening phrase of his collected poems, "You know I'm working Jan." They had=
 three children, Kate, Tom and Bonamy.

The poet J.H. Prynne, responding to Oliver's review of his second book,=
 Kitchen Poems (1968), welcomed Oliver in Cambridge to a new clan, poets=
 with shared empathies and raucous night lives. Oliver is remembered as a=
 ferocious and unprincipled player of the board game Diplomacy; sharp at=
 poker too. He researched in philosophy, witchcraft and theology, but=
 remained a journalist, with a privately disturbing family life.

Oppo Hectic (1969; from "o poetique"), his first book, was published by=
 Andrew Crozier's Ferry Press. Ferry would consistently publish Oliver=
 between 1969 and 1985. Oppo Hectic's 24 poems and discrete pieces fused Pop=
 Art, post-Victoriana ('Flesh-blue birds / two men sit on / khaki rocks /=
 eating birds gannets . . . Guillemot fry-up / with guano and dry seaweed=
 fuel . . How long a feast? dodo bell-name remorse / laughter peals / more=
 guillemot guillemot') and domestic poem into something both erudite and=
 witty. The wit verged on satire, came naturally and was not played for=
 laughs.

So my
word, love, attaches to the lining of
his oyster mouth; we'll let him
prosper it. Then Tom
will announce, one day: My father's
dead. You're my father.?

Tom, who was born with Down's Syndrome, died before his second birthday in=
 1969. His presence became a constant motif, centring around the notion of=
 'harmlessness' in many of his father's subsequent books. In the Cave of=
 Suicession (1974) was set in Suicide Cave, an abandoned lead mine in=
 Derbyshire's Peak District. Oliver slept there for many nights over a=
 period of months to achieve proximity to his subject, which drew in his=
 dead son. Cave was reproduced as he had typed it in the dark, mistyped, the=
 typos subverting a razor-sharp narrative, creating working contrasts=
 between surfaces and their durability.

A Now write for me the story of a man who acts so badly that I cannot be his
oracle, who lives with these failures w don continually reminding him of=
 what
he cannot do; and then write me the tale of how he yet does something worthy
of me.
Q How shall I write this?
A By living it; that rule has not changed.

Oliver's first novel, The Harmless Building (1973), was set in a town on the=
 south coast of England, one late August afternoon, the twin objects of=
 Donald's ambition were both asleep, the baby in the carrycot upstairs in a=
 room of that Georgian museum building, and Uncle Richard in an armchair in=
 his Victorian house only a mile or two away. A train crashes. The=
 idiosyncrasies of a dysfunctional family are portrayed through bereavement=
 and catastrophe. This colourful work, its frequent incidents owing more to=
 concepts of sixth sense and premonition than the subconscious, also=
 deferred to French Structuralism. Oliver was fluent in French, having left=
 Cambridge for Paris to work as translator for Agence France-Presse in the=
 late Sixties. Stylistically, The Harmless Building prefigured the early=
 films of Peter Greenaway:

In the park, late-abed seagulls circled overhead, calling ? Jacques Lacan,
Jacques Lacan?, without giving further details.

Oliver returned to England in 1972, to Brightlingsea, where he read=
 Literature at Essex University. He was offered a post there on his=
 graduation day having achieved the most distinguished BA in the=
 university's history. He taught part-time for five years, becoming close to=
 the critic Herbie Butterfield and, important to the latter part of his=
 life, two poets from New York, Ted Berrigan and Alice Notley. He composed=
 The Diagram Poems (1979) in Essex from syndicated reports on the Tupamaros=
 guerrillas in Uruguay, empathising with the Robin-Hood-style bandits. He=
 cast a searching light on the indistinct politics of revolutionary violence=
 and its barbaric suppression.

The early 1980s were marked by nervous illness, of which psoriasis was only
one manifestation. This period saw a rekindled interest in boxing, in
counterpoint to Jainism (the respect of every living creature, a belief to
which he devoutly kept). Peter Ackroyd, when at The Spectator, would=
 despatch
him to Italy to review boxing matches. In 1982 he took a lectureship at the
British Institute in Paris, teaching French pupils. Exhausting ferry=
 crossings
each weekend back to England and further work that took him as far as Haiti
and Grenada strained his marriage and separation ensued.

The Infant and the Pearl was based on the 14th-century alliterative poem=
 Pearl. He created a somnambulist voyage in a car with Margaret Thatcher and=
 various cabinet ministers. Melancholy, deftly rhymed, seeing further ahead=
 than the drive, Infant is more than an allegory on power:

The hills, though, were free, free of
disorder,
hills of privilege, of prerogative
governance,
a regime arising from the ruins of order:
lording it over the lean shires; once
the same Britain, now they were
Britain's border.

In 1987 Kind, his collected poems, was published, dedicated to his son. In=
 the same year his correspondence featured in Iain Sinclair's novel White=
 Chapel, Scarlet Tracings. Earlier published work featured in A Various Art=
 (also 1987), an unusually precise anthology which paved the way for a new=
 readership, and, three years later through Sinclair, his editor at Paladin,=
 Three Variations on the Theme of Harm. Nineteen eighty-seven was=
 significant, too, for his renewing his friendship with Alice Notley. Her=
 husband, Ted Berrigan, had died four years earlier. Oliver and Notley=
 married. They settled in New York. His later work evokes the friendship=
 with her sons Edmund and Anselm Berrigan, today also poets.

Oliver worked as a computer programmer in a cancer hospital and as a contact=
 tracer for HIV patients. Penniless Politics (1991), set in New York, was a=
 photocopied text Sinclair, as 'Hoarse Commerce', published in 150 copies=
 and received unusual attention for a fugitive publication. 'What was the=
 shock like,' asked Howard Brenton in The Guardian, reading T.S. Eliot's The=
 Waste Land when it was published in 1922? I think I know. I've just read=
 Douglas Oliver's epoch-making long poem Penniless Politics. I never thought=
 I would read anything like it in the 1990s. Penniless Politics sets the=
 literary agenda for the next 20 years. Further media coverage followed, and=
 Bloodaxe, not known in 20 years for recognising experimental poetry,=
 reissued the book in 1994.

In 1992 Notley and Oliver settled in Paris, where Oliver resumed teaching at=
 the British Institute. Three years later they both read at Mike Goldmark's=
 'Return of the Reforgotten' event at the Royal Albert Hall in London=
 alongside Allen Ginsberg, Sorley MacLean and Denise Riley. From 1996 to=
 1998 Penguin, Talisman in the United States and Etruscan Books published=
 variants on Oliver's ongoing projects. The Shattered Crystal, still to be=
 published in full, partly derives from his friendship with Gis=E8le Celan-=
 Estrange, the Romanian poet Paul Celan's widow. Oliver read this on his=
 final visit to England ? at the London festival For the Locker and the=
 Steerer in March last year. A handful of rich, yet sparse, works like 'Well=
 of Sorrows in Purple Tinctures', 'The Oracle of the Drowned', 'The Heron'=
 and the sequence 'What Fades Will Be' also retain an evanescent quality=
 where phrases and cadences flicker much like the ghosts Oliver became=
 increasingly haunted by.

Douglas Oliver was emotionally telepathic, gentle and almost devout. He was=
 generous with his time and his advice; he did not believe there were no=
 answers, but neither did he insist upon them. He was publicly supportive of=
 writers half his age like D.S. Marriot and Helen Macdonald. He researched=
 the run-down banlieues of Paris for his novel cum autobiography Whisper=
 Louise,a dialogue with the 'Red Virgin' of the Paris Commune of 1871,=
 Louise Michel. Last month Brian Oliver proof-read Whisper Louise's final=
 chapter, while his brother's body gave way to cancer. His last walks in the=
 city he loved were walks to stave off pain. His last four months showed=
 courage and concern for others, as he lay in bed in his and Alice's one=
 room unable to stand because so much of his spine had been cut away. I=
 retain an abiding image of Doug Oliver, when I last saw him in December,=
 psoriasis bleached out of his face by chemotherapy, ever blackbird-like;=
 surrounded by books, papers, collages and coins. His last book, A Salvo for=
 Africa, reflecting from a purely European perspective on the future of=
 Africa, some 10 years in the gestation, was published four weeks ago.

Milton Kessler, Poet and  Professor of English at SUNY-Binghamton (since
1963),
died April 17, 2000 at the age of 69.

His books included:
The Grand Concourse (Binghamton, NY : MSS paper book, 1990)
Sailing too Far (New York:: Harper and Row. 1973)
Woodlawn North, preface by Elizabeth Bishop (Boston : Impressions Workshop,
1970)
A Road Came Once, frontispiece by Ben Shahn (Columbus, Ohio State University
Press, 1963)

Milton Kessler has a poem in "The Final Issue" of Sulfur (45/46), which is
just
out. Here is an excerpt:

Walk to the epicenter of leaves on grass
struggle to keep carrying heavy bones
as I must each biblical day
        far from any bench
and without breath   Exhale   Expire
.....
I failed to find help in the tools of poetry. When asked
   what was wanted,
        fell into deafness--rain.
    Pain became
             frozen reason

To make up for the years without you, reader, I hug
        suffering and illness
which comfort me like the shoulders of a sweet roll
                                           at Reznikoff's
.....
How can I leave you, reader, just having found you again
in your corner-seat, empty pages shaking.

But I have an appointment with sleep.
No rimes left for subway souls.
.....

I was asked over the week-end by people who could attend only part of the
Russian/American poetry festival if I would provide a general summary of
the readings and discussions for this listserv. I agreed, but too
hastily, because in fact there was too much happening and too many people
involved to make a quick summary. I hope it will be enough to say that the
festival involved not only a great range of American poets (from Jackson
Mac Low to Samuel Menashe) but also the greatest range of Russian poets
ever to read together in the United States. There have been several
earlier festivals of Russian poetry in San Francisco, here at Stevens, and
elsewhere in the past decade, but they have generally included only poets
who began publishing in the 1980s or before. Also these festivals have
mostly not represented either women or gay writers adequately. The
Russian/American poetry festival this past week-end, therefore, included
very strong representations of younger poets, women poets, and gay poets
as well as poets who do not come from St. Petersburg or Moscow (most of
the Russian poets known to Americans are from one of these cities, and
this distorts the picture considerably). I hesistate to begin naming poets
and describing individual readings for fear of overlooking others or
misrepresenting the occasion. I would only add that there were some great
discoveries for us -- truly wonderful readings by Polina Barskova and
Galina Ermoshina and Alexandra Petrova and Yaroslav Mogutin and Dmitry
Volchek and Dmitry Voddenikov and . . . . And there's the problem.
How can you begin to describe the work of poets like Barskova and
Voddenikov who are as yet unknown to most of us? Most of the people
who read will be represented in John High's _Crossing Centuries_, but it's
also necessary to hear the language in order to know how large an edge the
Russians have over us. They are _very_ good! The only thing perhaps will
be to have another festival, and bring them back, and not have so many
things happening at the same time.

Hello fellow listees,

Saw this in the new John Lebow catalog, this real overpriced bookseller in
New Hampshire. Wonder who has commissioned him to do the sale, or where he
got a hold of it. Here's the description as it appears:

358. O'Hara, Frank. Meditations in Emergency. Grove Press, NY, 1957
Slipcase is somewhat worn and beginning to split at the rear joint. Except
for being lightly faded the book is fine. Only ninety copies of the entire
edition were hardbound, with fifteen containing drawings by Grace Hartigan.
However, most of the fifteen had the drawings removed by Grace Hartigan's
husband, who failed to renegotiate with the publisher. He removed the
remained of the drawings and sold them separately. This is copy fifteen,
which has had the drawings removed. However, it is signed and numbered by
O'Hara. Additionally, this copy belonged to "Beat Poet" Anne Waldman, who
later presented it to her husband, poet Lewis Warsh. A nice association with
the Beats who were influenced by P'Hara. Rare in the smaller edition.
$3,500.00 (yes, that's correct).

Madness,
david

right, someone dies, the discussion turns to anthropology, then it gets
really personal, x replaces y.  the telephone book is rewritten.  there was

This is completely on a lark, but I have a great and immediate need for
someone fluent in written Arabic and hopefully very familiar with
Egyptian contemporary culture. A variety of writing experience wanted,
but we can discuss that more in detail later. Oh, and you need to live
in the U.S. (preferably the east coast). This is for a short term (one
month, maybe more) gig.

So there is probably one person out there at most that comes close to
fitting the description. If you are that one person, please contact me
backchannel as soon as possible and we can discuss in greater detail
(best if you can include phone number and a time I can contact you).

If you know that one person and they are not on this list, please put
them in touch with me.

I wish I had posted this a week ago.

Isnt it rather a dynamic, where one person's authenticity causes others to
become authenticized, including the original person as his/her utterance
moves him/her from the true site of authenticity, the private mind, into
his/her alienated social self? The authentic is a private matter, I dont
see it can be agreed-upon w/o betrayal of what it means. Did the Earth move
for you, too? Yes, but it all depends upon what you mean by Earth, and
move. Did you enjoy my body? Uh, yes...was that what it was?--did you enjoy
my simulated orgasm? Until you said that, yes [which just might constitute
an authentic moment]....

Hello all,

FYI, from a recent piece an old friend of mine wrote in the SF Chronicle.

as ever,
David

Poet Allen Ginsberg penned much of the poem ``Howl'' at a now-demolished
cottage on Milvia Street in Berkeley. The site was unmarked until recently,
when the school across the street, the Arts Magnet Elementary School, built
a commemorative poetry garden. A plaque will go up later.

As part of the ongoing critical concern in and out of the academy with
the intersection of word and image, this one-day conference and roundtable
specifically questioned the application of language to visual imagery.
Of particular interest were the techniques by which we invent a specific
language to represent abstract imagery. The conference was thus about how
to relate to the abstract and how to describe that relationship.

I think Bowering's intent was to display his frustration with the
misspelling of Baraka's first name "Amiri," not to find out who Baraka is.

Once I wrote that I would be in "SF" and George (who lives in that one city
that people across Amerika know well by those two letters) posted, "Where is
SF?  Santa Fe?"

I think these actions display Bowering's idea of having fun, or his idea of
giving editorial advice, or his idea of penance, or something along at least
one of those lines.  Or heck, maybe it's just merely an e-reflex.

As someone who was there, I couldn't agree more with Edward Foster: it was
a very diverse and rich event, and the socializing that ensued was also
very interesting. Pity that Ivan Zhdanov didn't make it to Hoboken - a
major poet and an old friend whom I haven't seen for years. Wasn't he
denied his visa? What a shame! But other excellent people did make it!

Internet Philosophy and Psychology -                              May 00


(Because of my mother's death, this hasn't been sent out in a while. The
Internet Text is being issued on a cdrom in June, by Railroad Earth in
Atlanta; the cdrom will include audio, video, image, and other files as
well.)

This is a somewhat periodic notice describing my Internet Text, available
on the Net, and sent in the form of texts to various lists. The URL is:
http://www.anu.edu.au/english/internet_txt/ which is partially mirrored at
http://lists.village.virginia.edu/~spoons/internet_txt.html. (The first
site includes some graphics, dhtml, The Case of the Real, etc.)

The changing nature of the email lists, Cybermind and Fiction-of-Philoso-
phy, to which the texts are sent individually, hides the full body of the
work; readers may not be aware of the continuity among them. The writing
may appear fragmented, created piecemeal, splintered from a non-existent
whole. On my end, the whole is evident, the texts extended into the lists,
partial or transitional objects.

So this (periodic) notice is an attempt to recuperate the work as total-
ity, restrain its diaphanous existence. Below is an updated introduction.

-----

The "Internet Text" currently constitutes around 100 files, or 4000 print-
ed pages. It began in 1994, and has continued as an extended meditation on
cyberspace, expanding into 'wild theory' and literatures.

Almost all of the text is in the form of short-waves or long-waves. The
former are the individually-titled sections, written in a variety of sty-
les, at times referencing other writers/theorists. The sections are inter-
related; on occasion emanations appear, avatars possessing philosophical
or psychological import. They also create and problematize narrative sub-
structures within the work as a whole. Such are Julu, Alan, Jennifer, and
Nikuko, in particular.

The long-waves are fuzzy thematics bearing on such issues as death, love,
virtual embodiment, the "granularity of the real," physical reality, com-
puter languages, and protocols. The waves weave throughout the text; the
resulting splits and convergences owe something to phenomenology, program-
ming, deconstruction, linguistics, prehistory, etc., as well as to the
domains of online worlds in relation to everyday realities.

Overall, I'm concerned with virtual-real subjectivity and its manifesta-
tions, in relation to various philosophical issues. Recently I've been
working with body issues such as sickness, health, and death, as well as
a phenomenology of cancer; I've also been exploring issues of exhibition-
ism and the ontology of transparency. (See file lj.)

I have used MUDS, MOOS, talkers, perl, d/html, qbasic, linux, emacs, Cu-
SeeMe, etc., my work tending towards embodied writing, texts which act and
engage beyond traditional reading practices. Some them emerge out of per-
formative language soft-tech such as computer programs which _do_ things;
some emerge out of interferences with these programs, or conversations
using internet applications that are activated one way or another. And
some of the work appears from collaboration, for example with Barry Smylie
(flash) or Azure Carter and Foofwa d'Imobilite (video, dance).

There is no binarism in the texts, no series of definitive statements.
Virtuality is considered beyond the text- and web-scapes prevalent now.
The various issues of embodiment that will arrive with full-real VR are
already in embryonic existence, permitting the theorizing of present and
future sites, "spaces," nodes, and modalities of body/speech/community.

It may be difficult to enter the texts for the first time. The Case of the
Real is a sustained work that may be of help. It is also helpful to read
the first file, Net1.txt, and/or to look at the latest files (lf, lg, lh,
li, lj, lk) as well. Skip around.  The Index works only for the earlier
files; you can look up topics and then do a search on the file listed.

The texts may be distributed in any medium; please credit me. I would ap-
preciate in return any comments you may have.

I should mention you can find my collaborative activities at
http://trace.ntu.ac.uk/writers/sondheim/index.htm and my conference
activities at http://trace.ntu.ac.uk - both as a result of my virtual
writer-in-residence with the Trace online writing community. The last
trAce project, the Lost Project, is at http://trace.ntu.ac.uk/lost/ .

Or you may remember him as Leroy Jones, or you may remember him as Imamu --
but given George's prodigious feats of memory, I believe he was wondering
who this "Amira" is, since it's neither Amiri nor Amina --

Nicole Brossard
Co-sponsored with the Master of Arts in Writing at the University of San
=46rancisco

Nicole Brossard is one of the world's greatest writers and the most
influential Canadian novelist of her generation.  An innovative poet,
stylist, essayist and feminist, she's the author of the poetry collections
Daydream Mechanics, Lovhers, Typhon Dru, Installments, Musee de l'os et de
l'eau; and the novels Picture Theory and Mauve Desert, and the nonfiction
essay The Aerial Letter.  She lives in Montreal (Quebec) and she has won
the Governor General's award twice for her poetry (1974, 1984) and Le Grand
Prix de Poesie de la Foundation les Forges in 1989 and in 1991.  Early 2000
should bring the publication of "Installments," translated by Erin Mour=E9
and Robert Mejtels.  Brossard hasn't been to San Francisco in fifteen
years, since the epochal "Women and Words" conference at San Francisco
State, and since then she has only grown more goddess-like and divine.
Don't miss this rare theophany, on the highest hill of San Francisco-where
the angels touch ground--and don't forget, it's not at our usual space,
it's at USF.

Can anyone help me with background for the idea of "purifying the language
of the tribe?"  Who first came up with the phrase?  What's the historical
backdrop for the idea and the context for its utterance?  What do you
think are the implications?  Sources in which this idea is discussed would
be appreciated.

Thanks for your help!

I wasn't able to attend, but I heard from a friend that David was a smash hit at the Phoenix Theater reading in Petaluma CA with his famous "5 minute reading."  I also heard that L. Ferlinghetti "read" completely from memory and was wonderful.  (Sorry I couldn't make it David!  I was thinking of you though!)

This sounds right, but I think it's really misleading. Now I may have
gotten this wrong & maybe not all of my examples were well-chosen, but I
don't think you can describe the one I start with, various performances by
Van Morrison, as a "rhetorical simulation of a lack of eloquence". If that
describes Michael Palmer's work, which I also mention, okay. But Elizabeth
(I think) disagreed w/ my characterization of his work as ineloquent at
all, and I think she's basically right in the sense that the distinctions
blur around his work. Which is just fine by me. I think you can still say
that you _don't_ have here an old-fashioned sort of aspiration to
high-sounding eloquence. If you can't really decide whether this work is
even articulate exactly, then we at least have something in some sense new.

Okay, the other problem I have w/ yr remarks here is the classifying of
_people_ as articulate or inarticulate. That's just wrong on its face. I
never suggested that Van Morrison, say, is an inarticulate _person_. In
fact I began by pointing out how appealing the range of his performance is,
running a gamut from inarticulateness to a sort of musical eloquence. It's
not _him_. It's the utterance from moment to moment, and the point I would
head for is that sometimes it's harder & sometimes it's easier. To say what
must be said. What you call articulate people can find themselves
tongue-tied now & then. And sometimes powerful & moving expression can come
from unexpected sources or at unexpected moments.

Comments: To: Randolph Healy <suantrai@IOL.IE>

Thanks for the reply.  But of course Derrida can be paraphrased.
Norris has done a pretty good job with certain aspects of D's
methodology. as have others.  I agree we're working with difficult
texts, but when has that stopped us?  High modernism is difficult:
Eliot, Pound, Stevens.  So are the neo-modernisits: language poets.
Plus surrealists, symbolists, etc.  And most of us get Derrida
in translation, so that compounds the difficulty.  Part of the problem
is  that those boys we used to call the Yale School recast Derrida
in their own image.  Derrida is neither a nihilist nor a relativist.
His target is language in the same way the target for Quantum
physicists is the subatomic level.  Come back.

TWO POETS:


     KEVIN LARIMER   and    RACHEL BLAU DUPLESSIS


KEVIN LARIMER is an editor at POETS AND WRITERS. He recently graduated from
the graduate writing program at Iowa. He writes realy cool poetry and he
doesn't
stay out too late. He lives with John Colletti. He's friends with Katy
Lederer, editor of the Poetry Project Newsletter and Explosive! He chooses
his friends like he writes, with care and precision.


RACHEL BLAU DUPLESSIS is an essential element in the construction known as
L-A-N-G-U-A-G-E Poetry. She teaches at Temple University where she's wowed
and nurtured many of the up-and-coming, exciting new writers, e.g. Dave
Baratier, Chris Stroffolino, Maggie Zurawski, Pattie McCarthy, Dan Bouchard,
Chris McCreary, Yolanda Wisher, among many others. If you know any others
please add to this list.


*************************************************************************
LAST READING David Kirschenbaum and Daisy Fried, both very tall, showed off
their stature at Highwire.

David read from a tiny chapbook, Lately, Poems, among other work. David is a
tremendous presence, not only does he write poetry but he publishes booglit
magazine along with various chapbooks. He showed off the sort of charm that
one must possess to be so productive. His poems were musical and referred to
the many special poeple in his life. There is history in his work.

Daisy Fried showed off the chops that won her Pew last year. She captivated
the audience with her delicate and sensitive verse. I must admit that
earlier that day I stopped into Dirty Franks to say hello to a friend and
ended up there for 4 hours after about a dozen kamikazes and beers to
follow. I was feeling like the Huncke I imagine scribbling on napkins in the
Chelsea Hotel by the time Daisy went on, so my memory is foggy but I
remember that I enjoyed it.

I'm just reading "After Babel" by Steiner, and by a spooky coincidence, I came
across this assertion:

"Where language is fully used meaning is content beyond paraphrase"

The thought occurred to me is this: given that assertion, how do we know that
Derrida's language is "fully used"? One of the tools that might be used to
determine this, is to paraphrase the language as a waystation to a fuller
understanding. In my work, I constantly come across large chunks of code which I
have to debug, and to do this I have to understand what the code is doing;
however, a full understanding usually comes about by discovering "how it works"
- I usually have to paraphrase the code, either by writing it as pseudo-code or
a higher-level abstract, before going on to fully understand and debug the
program.

#  In that one definition of a random sequence is that it cannot be expressed

Derrida must go through an awful lot of typewriters :-)

Hi Bob!  Most academics with clout are consumed by their own
specialties.  They sort of have to be if they're going to plant
in their neck of the woods.  The downside for us is that such folks
have  no interest whatsoever in the contemporary scene, especially
if their specialties involve previous centuries.  Only the really
really famous ones like Vendler and Perloff feel confident, or
feisty, enough to broaden their scopes.  Can the same sensibility
that is devoted to Keats give equal attention/appreciation to visual
poetry?  It's possible, but rare.  There is also the nasty fact
that most academics--hell, most people--simply don't like radical
violations of narrative structure.  They like what they like and
there's not much we can do about that.  In that sense they're not
unlike us.  To boot, it's not really the job of the academy to
champion new forms, is it?  The academy is more like a serious
of roadblocks that force the new to earn its way.  Once the doors
are opened, profs will interrogate and preserve.  And we do have
a foot in the door.  Give it time and vp will cross the
threshold.

Review of Baraka & Taylor at the Poetry Project

        Since Harry Nudel's account of the Baraka/Taylor reading in NYC last
week was at least a little incomplete (and maybe unfair to the point of
being offensive) I wanted to present a (re)view (defense?) of some of what
else went down at that event, since both these poets have taught me to write
(and right) the scales...

        The reading was in the sanctuary of St. Marks Church, about 80% full
at the outset (a thoroughly mixed crowd, btw), probably 250-300 people on a
grim (wet & cold) night weatherwise.  Nice setting:  downstage huge tropical
plants from Hawaii, leftover from Easter, fresh roses by the podium; plenty
of serious and engaged folk in the audience.  After Ed Friedman's intro,
Baraka began as he often does, by demanding the production of revolutionary
journals and theaters.  On the pulpit, he begins by reading part one of
ALLAH MEAN EVERYTHING (see http://www-ec.njit.edu/~newrev/v2s4), which held
the audience spell-bound.  He continued by reading a series of shorter
poems, including "Pilgrims Progress" (where both god & the devil are
addressed as "motherfuckers"), and "Lo-Ku's" ("the african-american version
of haiku", e.g. "you can pray all day/and get no answer/but dial 911 and the
devil will be there in a minute"), all interspersed with AB scatting.  He
read his elegy to Stokely Carmichael, a poem for Newark (humming along with
riffs from a Stevie Wonder tune), and - perhaps the highlight of his set - a
new piece called "A MODEST PROPOSAL FOR GIULIANI'S DISPOSAL (IN FORTY ONE
VERSES WHICH ARE ALSO CURSES)".  To give you an idea of what these curses
consist of, here's the first few:

        Gather all the people Giuliani has hurt
        They should slap him forty one times
        With forty one sticks, forty one bats,
        On his bald head or across his hat.

        Let 41 wolves attack him and a poison
        Snake wrap him
        Forty one coils around his neck
               Then let these animals bite and infect
        Him
               Until he shows humans he
               Respects them
        Run him over with a police car 41 times
        Let the people he framed choke him
        And put him on a box covered with Lime

        But don't nobody kill him
        Keep him alive, every morning at 4 am
        Wake him up and start again

        Forty one blood tests
        Forty one needles
        Forty one pills
        Forty one enemas
        Forty one baths
        Forty one questions
        On Forty one pads
        Asked by 41 psychopaths.


        The piece went on, vigorously and viciously, for some time, and is
one of the bravest poetic rants I've ever heard, central to location and
cultural circumstance (Ginsberg would be proud).  Baraka then finished with
a poem ("Between Red & Ultraviolet"?) which ends "we is/we is/we is/we" &
massive applause.  It was an enthralling performance in the Negritude-plus
vein, in itself comparatively well worth the price of admission ($3 for
Poetry Project members).  & Imagine the perceived magical synthesis the next
day when we hear that the mayor has cancer!

        After a longish break, Cecil Taylor began, customarily, without
introduction.  The reading, according to John Fiske (recording engineer) was
57 minutes, about 2/3 the length of one of his musical sets (though it did
seem longer than that).  Cecil's poetry, which is musical but in a way much
different than Baraka's, is not everyone's cup of tea, for sure.  His
writing is unusually stylized, and is tedious to some (several of my most
respected friends who know his work planned in advance to split early).  So
what?  It's a demanding city.  Those who stayed were definitely moved,
changed - some submerged in contemplation or reflection, others lapsed into
dreamlike grinning states through the calm, steady barrage of image and
sound.  "Negative capability", the willingness to go along for the ride
(suspension while listening/processing, submitting to the poetry), plus
various degrees of patience and interest always absorbs me in the experience
of Cecil's use of language, the scientific and artistic themes and mastery
embedded in it.

        On this occasion, everything in the poem did have to do with
vibration (of one form or another, esp. music as vibratory essence), and
language, or as he said,  "the prosthetics of sound" (and thus the power of
it).  His perspective on the unions sounds can create is immense, and (to
me, a musician for 20 years) inspiring.  So to read later that it was a
"poem out of H.S. chemistry book" really made me wonder if Nudel and I were
in the same room that night, or if Nudel went to a really special high
school.  I don't recall any sections on or continuous connections to Monk's
Rhythmaning, Candello's architecture, or poets dancing etc. in any of my
teenage schoolbooks.  Cecil may go into a drone during readings, but also
sings, chants, moves within it to a heightened grace (OK, not for everyone).
The language is very intricate, gathering forces and spirits to exalt "the
power of utterances/as system/as meaning."  He fried our circuits with them.

        Since he was speaking of vibratory essences, I shouldn't have been
surprised when, after 30 minutes or so, cell phones began to ring.  Half the
audience was visibly agitated because of the reading's duration; there was
restless commotion in the back.  Others traveled about in the space of the
poem and moment.  An artist was sketching.  When Cecil sensed people's
impatience, did he stop?  Hardly:  A false ending, followed by a sigh of
relief from the beleaguered, was followed by more poetry.  Cecil kept going,
lightly prancing behind the podium!  By the time he quit, the audience was
1/3 of what it had been.  I had a feeling that some people were disappointed
that Baraka and Taylor hadn't performed together, as a local entertainment
magazine (Time Out) had implied.  Hmm.

        So much, and enough...

COLLECTED NOT SPEWED, a reverse reading of synthetic poetry, featuring the
work of Elana Abernathy, Humera Afridi, Joe Ahearn, Ray Bianchi, Brian
Clements, Ilex Fenusova, Michael Puttonen, John Richards, and Kristin
Ryling, will be held June 28, 7:51 PM, at the McKinney Avenue Contemporary
in Dallas.

This is a "reverse" reading since, rather than the poets standing up and
reading their work, the work will be posted on the walls and the audience
will be free to roam from poem to poem and read what they want. Note also
that rather than paying to get in, the audience will be paid for coming!

Free t-shirts will be given away and a toaster oven will be raffled.

Synthetic poetry is a new method and style of poetry writing which should
be almost completely dead by Wednesday, June 28 at 7:51 p.m.

Camille Roy
Melissa Wolsak

"Brilliant and horny as William S. Burroughs with his consciousness way
raised" (Girlfriends magazine), Camille Roy makes a welcome return to Small
Press Traffic.  Her books include Swarm (fiction, Black Star Series), The
Rosy Medallions (poetry and prose, Kelsey St. Press) and Cold Heaven
(plays, O Books).  Her work has appeared in numerous anthologies, including
Best American Erotica 1995 (Simon & Schuster), The New Fuck You: Adventures
in Lesbian Reading (Semiotexte), and Moving Borders: Three Decades of
Innovative Writing by Women (Talisman House).  She lives in San Francisco
and teaches creative writing privately and at San Francisco State
University. She is a founding editor of the online journal Narrativity (at
http://www.sfsu.edu/~newlit/narrativity) and her work is available online
at http://www.grin.net/~minka.

Again Small Press Traffic introduces to Bay Area audiences an important
talent, as Vancouver's Melissa Wolsak gives her debut reading in San
Francisco.  Discover the secret of this quintessential poet's poet, the
woman about whom insiders have been whispering for years.  Her work is an
engaging blend of Language-based materiality and a lyric strain that's
fresh as breeze from the sea.  Her first book, The Garcia Family Co-Mercy
(Tsunami Editions), was one of the great masterpieces of the
1990s-startlingly original and marvelously rigorous. Now there are two new
works, An Heuristic Prolusion, from Friends of Runcible Mountain, and the
ongoing long poem "Pen Chants, or nth or, 12 spirit-like impermanences."
At home in Canada she works as a metalsmith-like the Lord of the Rings!-and
her poetry is equally worked, jewel-like, magical.

Subject:      Desperate for Wieners! =p (the joke was there!)

Hi everyone,

  Yep, you guessed it: newbie here. I'm taking a poetry class at Chabot
College in Hayward, CA, and our instructor is Benjamin Hollander. For the
last project of the class, I am to do a presentation on the poet John
Wieners (sp?) and am having an exceedingly difficult time finding material
on him. Mr. Hollander pointed out two books (_707 Scott..._, _Cultural
Affairs..._), however I'm out of cash at the moment and none of our local
libraries have them (including University libraries), so I'm basically
S.O.L. What's worse is that the project is due on the 16th of this month,
and I have an English essay on Kafka's _The Trial_ due on the same day, for
the same instructor, in a different English class. Naturally, then, I'm
quite pressed for time.
  But of course, I'm not just going to present you all with my life's story,
so let's get down & dirty. I've been browsing all the messages on this
Listserv thingy and have a few questions regarding them.

1) I don't recall if I heard Mr. Hollander correctly--is John Wieners still
alive? If so, is there any way I can get in direct contact with him?

2) Can anyone provide me with a list of Wieners' books or books about him,
and if possible, ISBNs and/or locations of places I can get ahold of them?

3) If Wieners is still around (which I'm hoping!), is he scheduled to read
anywhere in the world in the future?

4) Any idea how I can get ahold of that Kevin Killian's Mirage #4 (whatever
that is), the issue dedicated to Wieners?

5) Lastly, if John Wieners is still around, then what's his mental/physical
condition as of now? I read in a 1997 posting that he was diagnosed with
schizophrenia.

  For any and all help I thank you in advance! I will most definitely credit
you in my presentation.

I have reconfigured the Poetics List archive www interface
such that the default display is now by date in reverse
chronological order (i.e., most recent message first)
rather than by topic. The options to sort by author and
topic remain in place, as does the search engine.

     One additional change: text is now displayed in a
proportional rather than a mono-spaced font. I don't think
this last will cause any problems, and it certainly leaves
the archive more pleasing visually.

The Poetics List archive is available at

<http://listserv.acsu.buffalo.edu/archives/poetics.html>

Subject:      Eloquence, a ramble
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

The new issue of Contemporary Poetry (Spring 2000, Volume 41, Number 1)
features an interview with Charles Bernstein. This very interesting
interview covers an array of topics, including quite a bit on eloquence, as
it happens.

"Q. What kinds of values, then do you see yourself examplifying as a poet
and critic?

  A. (Charles B.): I have an interest in bringing into poetry-I'm not sure
it's my taste- things that seem clumsy or awkward, and also that seem
overblown, purple passages, and so on. I like that aspect of Hart Crane,
for example. Most days, I have an aversion to tightly bound, aestheticized,
very tasteful poetry. OK, but to say that is already for me a highly
reflected aesthetic view. Partly, it's a reaction formation regarding my
inability or unwillingness to see myself as being assimilated within a
"high" culture of refinement. So rather than try to write poetry that makes
it seem I'm aiming for this sort of thing, as has often been the case with
poets, I'm trying to assert the beauty in a lack of grace; of
disgracefulness, you might say, but often in a highly elaborate, possibly
even refined way....One of the best examples I can give in Jerry Lewis in
The Nutty Professor....So I do have a taste for the asymmetric and the
off-balance, the spastic, which in my work is very often transformed into a
rhythmic element (flat-footed, lost in rime), taken as material to spin in
different ways, oscillate, create shapes that give these dis-positions a
buoyancy and a lightness that they don't necessarily have when you're
feeling awkward or stupid or inept. So there is a transformation involved
there- the poem as Rube Goldberg malapropism machine.

  Q. Are there other poets whose work demonstrates this awkwardness or turning?

  A. Well, somebody  I think is one the most elegant poets  of the time is
Michael Palmer. Palmer has a gracefulness, a fierce poise in his writing ,
which I like and admire. But what interests me about his work is the
loathing he has for the merely elegant- that is a very powerful undertow in
his writing....I think of Larry Eigner and Hannah Weiner especially, but it
is there in much of Jackson Mac Low, or, in a very different way, Ted
Berrigan. It's there in Susan Howe's stuttering and Bruce Andrews's
wobbling, Tom Raworth's velocity and Leslie Scalapino's (dis/re)
orientings. And, more recently, I think of the ways that Stacy Doris or
Juliana Spahr are working outside of poetic diction."

Chris,

Thanks for this detailed and even-handed account.

For those, like myself, who read of this performance from a distance
and wished we could be there, or who are otherwise interested in
Cecil Taylor's poetry as it's performed (though admittedly the
dimension of overdubbing brings in another sense of performance),
check out Chinampas, on Leo Records (or, if you're not up to the full
hour of unaccompanied poetry (well, some small percussion),
Tzotzil/Mummers/Tzotzil, which brackets an ensemble performance
featuring, a.o., Leroy Jenkins and Carlos Ward, between shorter
segments of the Chinampas sessions). Also, a look at Fred Moten's
essay on Chinampas in Dee Morris' _Sound States_ anthology might be a
useful starting point. And, unfortunately, something of an endpoint,
as there's little else I've been able to find on this aspect of his
work.

And of course, his "Sound Structure of Subculture Becoming..." text,
printed as liner notes to the Blue Note recording _Unit Structures_
(1966) is a classic  that ought to be read by everyone investigating
connections between jazz and writing, and researching African
American cultural poetics from the 60's on.

By the way, many recent recordings -- past decade or so -- will
feature several minutes of poetry, either as intro or sprinkled
throughout. It's a measure of the inability of the "jazz" industry to
deal with Taylor's "articulation, in every sense of that word" (to
echo C.S. Giscombe from a totally unrelated context) that most of
these recordings undermike the vocal portions of the performance to
the point of inaudibility. His set with the Art Ensemble of Chicago
on their Dreaming of the Masters suite dedicated to Monk stands out
as an unusual instance of recording engineers giving his voice the
equal weight it ought to have in the ensemble texture of such a
performance.

Thanks again,
Taylor

originally, he changed his name from Leroy Jones to LeRoi Jones, then from
LeRoi Jones to Imamu Amiri Baraka, then, since "Imamu" is an honorific for a
high priest, he pared down to Amiri Baraka.  Always a first and last name.

It is difficult to take William James Austin's generalities about academics
seriously. I'm happy to say I know & have known plenty of academics who
specialise -- even specialise in past centuries -- & maintain lively
interests in contemporary scenes.  How they score in terms of really really
famous I wouldn't presume to know.

Layne Russell, that is-- to whom,many thanks. But far from being famous,
this poem can't be known to most Listafarians : it's a performance piece, a
5-minute meditation on the 5-minute span so popular, and so often violated,
at these monster readings. The reading, in an old theater whose music
programs are popular with youth of all races, was a benefit to raise money
towards its renovation. It was preceded by an address by Mr. Garrett of the
NAACP, who, though also under the 5-minute stricture, bravely ignored it to
give us--whether brown, pink, yellow, black, brown or white (a key point of
his)--an unanticipated history of civil rights in the USA, which, I am
told, ran for some twenty minutes. His was the act I followed, and because
my piece declares at the outset that it will not take any longer than the
announced  moiety of time, and because it is clearly frivolous, I suppose
the audience welcomed it, and gave it more credit than it merits.
   Ferling's by-heart performance of some poems from _Coney Island of the
Mind_,  Far Rockaway accent and all, was impeccable and a welcome trip down
memory lane for your reporter, who first heard these works 4 decades since.
It was scrupulously and precisely five minutes long, and he steadfastly
refused the general demand for an encore, though he said to me later that
he simply hadn't heard it.  Many and various, and mostly local, were the
poets to be heard. I regret that I can't report on Sharon Doubiago, Julie
Reid and Terry Ehret, among others whose luck it was to read later on the
roster; exhaustion prevented my staying to the end. The place at the outset
appeared to be full, so a bit of money must have been gleaned from an
audience that was generous to a fault. As one who sat in its stalls for Van
Morrison and braved its mosh-pit for Jimmy Clift, I hope that the Phoenix
fends off the developers who would tear it down & put up something more
profitable (leastwise, to them) in its place.   David.

John Wieners:
Selected Poems 1958-1984, Black Sparrow press ISBN 0 87685 661 X
Cultural Affairs in Boston, Black Sparrow ISBN  0 87685 738 1
Hotels, Angel Hair Books, 1974 (xerox)
Behind the State Capitol or Cincinnati Pike, Good Gay Poets Press, 1975 ISBN
0 915480 00 X

There is also a short sequence called "from A Waiter Out of a German Hotel"
(7 poems) in O/blek 10.  There probably also has been other magazine
publication of more of Wieners' more recent work that I'm unaware of;
however, the above constitutes an oeuvre substantial enough on wch you might
base your presentation.

John is still very much alive.  I talked with him briefly several weeks ago
on Columbus Avenue in Boston; he is at times not particularly talkative, tho
my understanding is that this is not always the case.  I asked if he was
writing, and he said no.  I later asked someone close to him if John was
writing, and he answered in the affirmative, without hesitation.  So.  Safe
to say, I think, that John may be often reticent toward a public view of his
current activities, and so maybe also not the best source for information
viz yr presentation.  Nevertheless,

you could trying calling.  I don't have the number, tho I'm fairly certain
it's unlisted - try Boston area information; his address is 44 Joy Street,
Boston.


I have a copy of a portion of the Wieners issue of Mirage - some dozen
essays, poems &/or "statements, the most significent among wch are pieces by
Charles Shively and John Wilkenson - wch I am willing to xerox and send your
way.  Ditto the short collection (approx. 10 pp) "Hotels" (above).  Most of
John's earlier books are collected in "Selected Poems" (there are also two
substantial interviews w/ John at the back); "Beind the State Capitol", his
magnum opus (200 pp) - parts of wch appear in the "Selected" - is, he once
sd., to be read as a single long poem.

I believe Wieners to be THE political poet of our era.  His work makes clear
that in a time when desire finds its most useful social placements in the
material analogies of basically industrial or mechanical (re)production,
individuals find their own paths toward satisfaction blocked by the mutual
rise of identifying proper nouns based on the accumulation of power (the
fascinating [root, fasces, same as fascism] glitz of "reputation",
Hollywood-style) against which the activating verbs of choice through which
one lives out each their daily lives may become inoperative to the extent
that any attempt to exist outside the ordinal realm of this same
grammatical/theological/political/industrial strain (ie., preordained
"policy") produces images of somatic activity perpetually incommensurate
with an more proportionate image of the human body and being held thus
within such (at times desperate) clutchings.  While this constitutes only a
limited, single strain of Wiener's corpus, it nevertheless in my own view,
lies very much at the center of his work.
There is much more to say about this, but, for the nonce, this is all I have
time for.

If you wld like copies of any of the available materials delineatred above,
email your postal address, and I'll try to get these in the mail to you muy
pronto.

Best wishes, and good luck with your project,
Stephen Ellis

DANIEL SPOERRI: Le Cabinet Anatomique

May 11th to June 10, 2000

Reception for artist: Wednesday, May 24th, 6:00-8:00

Exhibition Catalog Available

Emily Harvey is proud to present a
series of new works by Daniel Spoerri: assemblages for
which Spoerri has found his starting point in a suite of original
surgical lithographs from l839 by N.H. Jacob, a student of Jean-Louis
David. He "completes" these exquisitely drawn illustrations with
carefully overlaid objects.  This group of works is the third (and
currently final) part of a larger series entitled Le
Cabinet Anatomique.


Spoerri is an inveterate collector of the most curious expressions of
human creativity, retrieving such objects, as he retrieved the original
graphics to which he applied them, from Europe's various flea markets.
The works are small in scale and display an eerie, jewel-like
precision; and though the images are often cruel, they are presented
with great equanimity.


The exhibition is accompanied by an illustrated catalog on Le
Cabinet Anatomique published by the Emily Harvey Gallery with
a text by the art critic Otto Hahn, translated and introduced by Henry
Martin.


Born in Rumania in l930, Daniel Spoerri is one of our era's most
versatile  talents: in addition to being a visual artist, he has also
been a dancer, choreographer and theater director, as well as the
editor of a magazine of concrete poetry. He  moved from Switzerland  to
Paris at the end of the l950s where he became connected with the group
of the Nouveaux R=E9alistes: Yves Klein, Jean Tinguely, Arman and Martial
Raysse. In l962, he also took part in the first Fluxus Festival of New
Music, in Wiesbaden. In l968 he opened the Eat Art Gallery in
Dusseldorf, which produced and presented edible works of art by
contemporary artists.


The l960s were the period of his first tableaux pi=E8ges
or  "snare pictures," in which chance arrangements of objects, on
tables or in drawers, were "snared" and fixed into permanent place
exactly the artist  found them. These works were followed by "false
snare pictures," in which the composition had been thoroughly planned,
even while creating  the impression of having been determined by
chance.


The notion of chance as a guiding principle of Spoerri's work was
succinctly formulated by the little book which he published in l962,
entitled La Topographie anecdot=E9e du hasard
(republished in l966 by The Something Else Press in the English
translation of Emmett Williams asAn Anecdoted Topography of
Chance) in which he records all the objects found on the table
of his Paris hotel room on October 17th, l961 at 4:17 p.m., also
evoking the memories they subsequently brought back to him.


Later phases of Spoerri's work were guided by mottoes or titles such as
detrompe-l'oeil(undeceiving the eye), pi=E8ges =E0 mots (word traps), or
pi=E8ges =E0 hommes (man traps), all of which can be seen as variations
on the "snare picture,"  in the sense that the artist exacerbates the
literal meanings of images to the point  finally of derouting them into
absurdity.


Daniel Spoerri currently lives and works in Tuscany, Italy, on a farm
in the town of Seggiano, where he is constructing a monumental
sculpture garden that includes the work of many of his friends, in
addition to his own.


Daniel Spoerri will be present for a reception Wednesday, May 24. This
occasion marks his first visit to the United States since l975.

Word wrap seems to have been turned off - the Poetics List messages now
stretch out to the right in a politically dangerous manner. Or is that just
my computer losing its wrappers?

Just as we were preparing to install gro-lights & slip a little spirulina
into everyone's drink, New York hit 80 degrees under blue skies today.
While delighted to shed the Seasonal Affective Disorder we'd so
meticulously cultivated over the past month of snow & rain, we're equally
concerned that nobody spends too much time working on their tan before the
summer even begins.

Might we offer a respite from the sun's ruthless rays & a place to slake
your thirst, a respite we call THE ZINC BAR SUNDAY NIGHT READING SERIES.
You won't find a higher SPF than here at the underground Moroccan bar in
New York's Underground Moroccan Bar District.  & you won't find readings
more compelling than these.

Why look -- Here's the month at el zinco, coming atcha:

SUNDAY MAY 7: DONNA CARTELLI + ELIZABETH YOUNG
SUNDAY MAY 14: ELINOR NAUEN + MAGGIE DUBRIS
SUNDAY MAY 21: EILEEN MYLES + BILL LUOMA
TUESDAY MAY 23: RELEASE READING FOR LUNGFULL! MAGAZINE ISSUE 9

Your hosts are trapped in the bodies of Douglas Rothschild & Brendan Lorber.

All readings are at 6:37pm & will run you $3 -- with the exception of the
LUNGFULL! release.  That's $5 to get in & another $5 if you want a copy
(you save $3 off the cover price).  Also, things will start cooking about
6:00pm on that night & the reading itself swings into action at 7:00pm.

The Tuesday night release of LUNGFULL!  Will feature these fine poets:
BRUCE ANDREWS
ANSELM BERRIGAN
GEOFF BOUVIER
ALBERT DESILVER
MARCELLA DURAND
CLIFF FYMAN
BILL KUSHNER
KAREN WEISER
DANA STEVENS
FERNANDO PESSOA

Zinc Bar is at 90 West Houston between Laguardia & Thompson.

If you want more information, Brendan's at 212.533.9317 or
lungfull@interport.net & Douglas, he's 212.366.2091.

Wishing you only the best of moods,
on behalf of Douglas & everyone at Zincateria
I remain your big zero,
Brendan Lorber

PS:  I'm forever misplacing my copy of the Double Happiness reading
schedule, hosted this month by Prageeta Sharma & Kristin Prevallet.  So
you'll know who's reading there when I pester you for the names later on, I
thought I might give you the skinny on that series as well....

A note to announce "Transgressing Boundaries and Strategies of Renewal in
American Poetry", a poetry conference to be held at the Universidad de
Salamanca, Spain, this month.

The conference covers a lot of interesting material featuring numerous
important European scholars. A number of poets and critics close to this=
 list
are also involved. Most of the sessions are in English. If anyone is in the
area, you may wish to attend! Otherwise, a read of the topics for this
conference is interesting indeed.

For more information, the URL for the conference is
http://www3.usal.es/english/conference.html

Appended is the conference program for your convenience.

Subject:      derrida
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

I think the reason some of us have rejected Derrida is nicely expressed by
Stanley Cavell, discussing JD & Austin, roughly thus: for Austin (as for
Wittgenstein) the metaphysical represents something like a flight from the
ordinary, and is essentially delusional; for Derrida (as for Heidegger) the
ordinary is a flight from the metaphysical and is essentially delusional.
Some of us no longer believe in the hermeneutics of suspicion, no longer
believe that everyday life, all art, culture, politics, everything, is
shaped by ideology (metaphysics of one kind or another). That is the
fundamental difference between Wittgenstein and Derrida.

While Wittgenstein & Austin on the one hand, and Heidegger & Derrida on the
other have a similar conspiracy-theory sort of appeal (like Nietzsche,
showing you what's really going on, and incidentally now you don't actually
have to read Kant or Husserl or whoever), my guys only claim that a very
small group of people carry on a very odd & pointless, muddled sort of game
(philosophy) whereas the other guys claim that this is the most important
stuff in the world and those of you doing Theory are doing the most
important work there is, that you are unmasking all of human history, etc.
etc.

That's the thumbnail. I should say Cavell's presentaion is markedly more
sympathetic to Derrida than I'm being, or at least more interested. Those
are the broad strokes of Why I Don't Read Derrida Anymore, without getting
into quibbles about his methodology, what it is, what it isn't, and so on.
(Although I do have a few quibbles.)

Especially in this theory-laden age, I think this has implications for
poetics, but I'm not clear yet on what they are. A lot of the terms here
seem to resonate with terms from romantic-era poetics (imagination vs?
reality, ordinary language, etc.) and that seems likely to muddy the waters
-- or maybe it'll help us finally settle accounts with Romanticism, who
knows...

A Note: Here at Fence we had underestimated a recent surge in the ranks of
our subscribers and so are left with only a small quantity of copies in our
store-room. So I encourage you, if you're interested in this issue, to go
out to your local bookstore, be it independent or Barnes & Noble, and buy
it there. (B&N takes a huge proportion of our print-run; if/when it doesn't
get bought they trash it. So please trash your principles for just a few
minutes and buy it there if you can't find it elsewhere.)

That said, Fence can also be ordered on our website, at
http://www.fencemag.com, and at SPD's website: http://www.spdbooks.org

Subject:      Re: purifying the language?
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain

The source for this is Mallarme, in a preface to an edition of his poems as
I recall. Eliot uses it later in _Four Quartets_  -- "Burnt Norton" I
believe it is -- to drive home a point about the high calling of the English
poet. For TSE, this was a decidedly imperialistic project which differed
from Mallarme's no less elitist, but nevertheless different, aim of creating
distance between the Symbolists and the bourgeois neo-Parnassians or whoever
they were. I'm sure others on the list can a more historically detailed
account.

When I interviewed Ron Sukenick a few years ago he remarked that maybe the
job of the writer now was to muddy up the language of the tribe, i.e. take
it back from the homogenizing, single-gauge forces of consumer culture. To
resist absorption, as Bernstein would put it.

>>>One additional change: text is now displayed in a
proportional rather than a mono-spaced font. I don't think
this last will cause any problems, and it certainly leaves
the archive more pleasing visually.<<<

But haven't people submitted poems, or snippets of poems, or hopes toward
poems, etc. that have depended on mono-spacing for visual measurement?
Here's another question: do the Sondheim poems "belong" in any other font
than mono-spaced computer text?

isn't it strange that we still use the language of published printed poetry
to describe poetry that is spoken/performed in public.
surely 'sounding' of poetry might be more appropriate than 'reading' of
poetry.
but sounding is even inadequate in capturing the feel of a live event.
the look of the poet, their identity, personality, the venue they perform
in, the nature of the audience, the ambient "noise"(from coffee machines,
bars, clinking cutlery, background discussions about football, etc..), the
presence or absence of alcohol, the presence or absense of amplification
equipment, the time of day; the context of the reading.

has anyone attempted to write in or develop a language to ctiticize or
theorize about performance poetry?

Ah, I should have been clearer: the option remains to revert
from a proportional to a non-proportional font. I have only
changed the default mode of display.
     As to the format of Alan's poems, this, too, is a very
good question. When some years ago I published -Jennifer-,
a section of his works, on nominative press, I found that
indeed only a sans-serif font would do. In that case I chose
Arial; in this I would recommend the non-proportional font.
Of course, one shouldn't forget that, of the 800+ people
now reading this message (or not), it's conceivable 600 of
you are reading it in something other than the 9-point
Monaco in which it was typed.

[for any in the san diego area this weekend]

"Poetic Visuals: Text and Texture in Art and Visual Poetry"
with guest artists and writers:

Bibiana Padilla
Heriberto Yépez
Carlos Adolfo Gutiérrez Vidal
Aida M. Mancillas
Alex Donis
and moderator Joel Kuszai

The art and poetry forum brings together six artists and poets working
actively in San Diego, Tijuana, Los Angeles and Mexicali. This year's event,
including poetry readings, art display, web-based installations, and panel
presentations, provides a community forum for the discussion of visual
and literary arts in the context of cross-cultural exchange and cross-genre
influence. San Diego in the 21st century is a meeting ground for
disparate cultures whose art in many cases reflects the meeting of aesthetic
ideas and forms in addition to the meeting of cultures and languages. The
panel for this year's event calls attention to this convergence, with
working artists representing a wide assortment of genres, aesthetics,
languages, and modes of delivery, but at the same time sharing an interest
in the relation between text (language) and texture (visual image).
The forum will address the issues of recognition, comprehension and
distribution of experimental art in a region (Southern California and Baja)
rife with conventions of division and segregation. Also, the forum will
ask how art and poetry as modes of social exchange operate within and beyond
larger social, political, artistic and linguistic conventions, as well as
how art and poetry can negotiate conventional divides
and initiate dialog across cultures, languages, and practices.

Hi All,

I'm going to be teaching a Craft of Fiction class again in the fall.
It's sort of a hybrid between a lit class and a writing workshop--for
MFA students.

Last time I taught this, I did Epistolary Form, and many on the
poetics list were very generous with suggestions.

This time I'm thinking of centering the class around Description--and
in a broader sense, looking at the translation of the material world
into the abstraction of writing.  I want to look at tactics for
privileging/muting various senses.  Also want to look at ways of
defamiliarizing the sensual world.  Want to look at ways in which
"we" categorize physical details (thinking Susan Stewart and Mary
Douglas).  I'd like to look at small portions of a wide range of
texts, from the most conservative to the experimental.

My questions are rather vague at this point since I'm still
formulating this, but suggestions about any of the following would be
helpful:

1.  Any pertinent issues/topics that would broaden this discussion.

2.  Theoretical writings on the topic that are fairly accessible.

3.  Any primary (prose-ish) texts that you think do
interesting/surprising things with description.

4.  Writing exercises to stretch students' conceptions of description.

This is a lot, and I have many ideas myself, but if anything comes to
mind, please share your thoughts with me.

Best,
Dodie

Two books I can recommend and in which, I think,
the matter has been significantly, if only newly
broached:


-Sound States: Innovative Poetics and Acoustical Technologies-
with Compact Disc / ed. Adalaide Morris
Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 1997

Despite that this collection deals predominantly
with technology-as-machine (rather than, say, the
construction of the ear), very strong readings of
poetry-in-performance and recorded poetry are to
be found throughout. Of especial interest is Nate
Mackey's article "Cante Moro," which explores the
relation of the New American Poetry to Lorcan
duende, flamenco, and, briefly, jazz.


-Close Listening: Poetry and the Performed Word-
ed. Charles Bernstein
New York: Oxford University Press, 1998

Perhaps more directly to the point of kz's query,
this collection contains solid forays into the
theory, practice and history of the poetry reading
as a Euro-American genre(s). Peter Middleton and
Jed Rasula both provide excellent critical histories
of the reading form; Maria Damon a considered analysis
of the open-mic reading and the poetry slam; Dennis
Tedlock remarks on a poetics of verbal polyphony. The
"closest" listening/reading I recall is Middleton's
excellent if brief analysis of John Ashbery's reading
at the 1985 Cambridge Poetry Festival.

Middleton: "Instead of thinking of the poem as
something that moves around being variously
interpreted, read aloud, published in different
forms, and generally provoking distinct
interpretations, we might be better to think of
it all as a large heteroclite entity, that mixes
texts, people, performances, memories, and other
possible affinities, in a process that engages
many people, perhaps only briefly, over a long
period of time, whose outcomes are usually hard
to see, and which has no clear boundaries, not
the page, the reading, the critical study."


And, of course, I myself am writing an essay on
the performance of poetry, slated as yet to appear
nowhere, but which will include at least two close
analyses and a number of near-misses. But more on
this point momentarily.

cheers, Chris

Yep, and their taste in "contemporary poetry" ranges, as more than one
of them has declared, "from Wilbur to Ashbery."

BANGSLAP reading, right in the kisser (postmodernism ain't as vicious). Ron
Silliman finally graced our presence, and, serendipitously, Mr. Greg Fuchs had
appropriately flattering quotes built into his introduction for Rachel. KEVIN
LARIMER, the man from New York whom Greg spoke so highly of, delivered an
introspective set flavored with the melancholic & elegiac. Blue is a good way
to describe it, as Greg did in his introduction. Also, Greg continues his
valorization of rock and roll as a legitimate cultural reference point. Of
Kevin, a woman remarked that she had never heard a spoken voice so beautifully
integreted with the poetry it was speaking. RACHEL BLAU DUPLESSIS wowed
another adoring crowd as she read forom two of her most recently published
DRAFTS (I forget the numbers). These pieces embody the  thought-creative
process trasferred to the page. The mind grapples with the world, its
intangible uncertainties (Time, for instance), notices mispellings of words
during the writing process, follows the subconscious rewrites to their
suggestive conclusions. The intellect is formidable, the observations close,
the relevance incalculable. It was a satisfying meal, which we chased with
several aperitifs at the local pub. (Note: the account in the last e-mail of a
mid-afternoon Herbert Huncke drink-a-thon was penned by my esteemed colleague,
not me!) Phew, these things get longer and longer...

Yes, thanks, Maria, good suggestions.  I was remembering this morning
reading some text that discussed the intense descriptiveness of the
bourgeois novel originating from the rise of tourism as a past-time.
It was quite a while ago and I can't remember where I read this.
Does this sound familiar to anybody?

Thanks.

Among the materials I have taught or plan to teach:

Alain Robbe-Grillet, -Snapshots- and -For a New Novel: Essays on Fiction-
   [especially "Nature, Humanism, Tragedy" and "From Realism to Reality"]
Gertrude Stein, -Tender Buttons-
Franz Kafka, various journal entries, fragments and short stories
Elias Canetti, "Cemetaries" in -Crowds and Power-
Lyn Hejinian, -My Life-
Walter Benjamin, "A Berlin Childhood" in -Illuminations-
Theodor Adorno, "All the Little Flowers" in -Minima Moralia-
Rosmarie Waldrop, -The Reproduction of Profiles-
Kathy Acker, "My Death My Life by Pier Paolo Pasolini" in -Literal Madness-
Raymond Chandler, -Farewell, My Lovely-
   [in this, the disjunction between subject matter and the tone
    or the terms of description]
and (blush) your own little book -Hallucinations-
   [useful to initiate a class project of brief writings]


Something I've been working with in my composition classes
is the interplay between (loosely) description and speculation,
the presentation of surface-sense and the assumptions or projections
that position necessitates - the difference between, say, what
Robbe-Grillet once thought he was doing, and what Canetti does
when he tries to uncover the "secret satisfaction" one supposedly
derives from visiting a cemetery. I've found Kafka and Stein,
also Rosmarie Waldrop useful for challenging the binary, i.e.,
the idea of description as anything other than a sort of
programmatic speculation. Chandler, too, could be useful in
making evident what is smuggled in under the guise of the
descriptive - perhaps with Tina Darragh's "Raymond Chandler's
Sentences" in -Striking Resemblance-. I'd like to teach
Freud's case study -Dora- in the same vein, but I don't think
my students would go along with it.

This is likely too elementary to be of any use; whereas, if
I can get my students even to understand, let alone challenge
the opposition between description and speculation - or to debunk
the notion of objectivity when, as frequently happens, we talk
about an article from the student newspaper - I feel that I'm
doing quite well. Of course, some of my students have never
read a novel before they come into my class - and a few of
them probably still haven't when they leave. This, by the
way, isn't sneering: most of my students come from western
New York, where, after years of right-wing de-funding of
public education and community services, it's a wonder they've
learned to read. I do my best to present them with relatively
difficult materials and to work through those materials with
them; some of them hate it, but the pay-off is that at least
one kid each semester seems to be shocked and interested to
find there's anything - as Ambrose Bierce says - beyond the
Land of the Magazines; and a few more may discover that
questions are as important as answers.

Check out the novels of Jonathan Bayliss - Prologos, Gloucesterbook and
Gloucestertide, all of wch have incredibly detailed description, esp. the
first.  They've all three been published by small houses, so don't know how
readily available they might be on the west coast, but if you're interested,
let me know and I'll send you whatever, publishers' names, ISBN numbers, or
perhaps an address through which some copies might be unearthed or
de-warehoused.

Dear Dodie,

Descriptive writing is my favorite kind, I have come to believe. My models
are as follows:

In his novel White Mule, William Carlos Williams convincingly describes the
consciousness of an infant during a thunderstorm.

James Schuyler -- poems like 'February'  but even fantastic
narrative/descriptions like 'Milk'. Also, of course, his art writings in
'selected' format issued by Black Sparrow: see his piece on Joe Brainard,
see in that his paragraph on the work called 'Prell.'

John Clare - a predecessor.

Elizabeth Bishop, poems & prose, ditto.

Whitney Balliett -- the only writer I know who can tell you about the music
he's heard the night before, how it sounded, how it was played, like a
sportswriter (Red Smith, AJ Liebling) on a game. & it's jazz, one-time,
improvised music. Any collection of his New Yorker pieces will do --
American Musicians is one. I like the piece on Sid Catlett, 'Big Sid."

John McPhee -- the descriptive journalist, par excellence. Start with the
latest piece on shad fishing (it doesn't matter what you or he write(s)
about, tell your students that!) in NYorker, go back to the classic Oranges,
dip into the geology books (now under one cover).

William Bartram. Travels. Naturalist's writings should be included; Thoreau,
Darwin. . . Pliny?

Sei Shonagon's Pillow Book.

Jennifer Bartlett's self-portrait in The History of the Universe.

MFK Fisher on eating.

Robert Smithson. Monuments of the Passaic. Mirror Travels in the Yucatan.

Read Donald Judd on Barnett Newman in Judd's Complete Art Writings 1959-75.
I can send you this if you can't find it. Judd's art writing is all
description with wonderful flatfooted opinionating as garnish.

Fairfield Porter is a good describer, too: Art in its Own Terms (Zoland). &
Baudelaire in his salons, & Diderot in his salons,  & Henry James The
Painter's Eye.

Edwin Denby. Two books: Looking at the Dance and Dancers, Buildings, People
in the Streets (these you can find in pb. now & then in used books stores --
but selected writings now in print from Yale is OK. Prime essays: 'Three
Sides of Agon,' 'Dancers, buildings. . .,' 'Balanchine Choreographing'. Then
there are lots of short reviews. Have students read in Dancers, Buildings
lecture the part of about Do you see the city you live in. . . the momentary
look of Sixth Avenue and. . .?

Raymond Chandler - first page of  The Big Sleep, essential.

Ronald Firbank  Prancing Nigger and The Flower Beneath the Foot; Alain
Robbe-Grillet  The Voyeur, The Erasers &c. (how does Towards a New Novel
read now?).

Kerouac - the sketches (like one about a vent pipe) in Visions of Cody. All
of October in the Railroad Earth (& play them the recording "But it was that
cut of cloud above the old SP alley, 3rd & Townsend. . . ." on a boom box
while you stand there of an afternoon).

Does anyone write convincingly about sex (excepting of course yourself)?
Bataille at the end of Story of the Eye. Auden's The Platonic Blow, in
rhyme, I have a copy. The dry hump in subway scene in Black Spring by Henry
Miller. Anais Nin? Hejinian/Harryman? (too precious, probably) DH Lawrence?
Read Duchamp's note on Large Glass given to Maria Martins, page one, bottom.
Please tell me if any man or woman has really written a description, not an
emotive address, on/of fucking. Have you (even)?

Good luck, Dodie. I wish I could take your course!

Bill

yes, actually, now that I look back at past publications, there was, at
least in spelling.  I guess the downplay was in the removal of the "Imamu",
but others may know far more than I.
There's so much of his work that I haven't read...

   This is the 2nd male poet, remember to forget Robert Hass, who like Reagan was perfecto for the Prez role... is perfecto for the role of poet lauriate, rugged charming professionally oily, rite the post alzheimer Reagan...the other woman ended her poem "your words are but shadows you leave but i cannot follow...

   I was sitting where i could hear best so i really couldn't see..to the query whether anyone was hot?...Jimmy D mentioned Ashberry..there was a lotta of Sylvia Plath and Even more Liz Bishop..a poem he couldn;t remember...


        The UNBEARABLES set up the alternate reading at K...in was in memory of Stanley Kunitz and the life of poetry...a big 300 pound black security guard made 'em stop...no poetry permit..Michael Carter read a good poem...Bonnie Finberg, Sparrow who was even in the N.Yorker...etc..etc...

Perhaps an auto message to the sender like "Your message dated...is in HTML
format and therefore cannot be forwarded to the list.  Please reformat your

save you the unnecessary work of reformatting messages and sending constant

MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII

my humble critique of Derrida:

I have yet to see a sensible argrument mounted against
Derrida's evaluation of the metaphysical tradition.  What I have
read are vague resistances aimed at what can only be described as
a caricature of Derrida and deconstruction, written by those who
clearly have not read him extensively and/or do not understand
what they have read. (W.J.A)

honey would you care to rectify my Derrida? (get him back on course) I
guess I missed the point - but then I guess we all did. (W.J.A excepted)

you know to know how to love him no matter what he does - I guess because
knowing what you do is more important than what you do.

you know I'd have to get up on my metafisyxs to get down with you boys and
I guess I should do it properly ... thoroughly ... get in your know but
then I'd rather be getting down with supplementary Cixous and reading
Derrida like Derrida reads his daddy Lacan.

Hello Dodie -

Along with Proust, Balzac and Henry James - masters of detailed
description, each word an essential pearl ... [a mastery
 few have the patience for I admit, but ...] - in particular I'm
thinking of Balzac's sublime descriptive passage in the beginning of
"The Wild Ass's Skin'].
There's a very good book called 'Writers on Artists' edited by Daniel
Halpern [ISBN: 0865473404,Publisher: North Point Press]
I'm not sure if it's what you're looking for, but Rilke on Cezanne's
work is breathtaking "Letters on Cezanne" [ISBN: 088064107X,Publisher:
Fromm International Publishing].

When did he drop Imamu?  I saw him read in '94 and the program / ads still
read Imamu Amiri Baraka.

Hi Dodie -- I'm mildly surprised Jack Kerouac hasn't showed up in this
thread. "Visions of Cody" specially has a number of long descriptions of
cafeterias & diners which are easily extractable from context.

Subject:      Steve Benson - 20 February 1990

Content-Type: text/plain; charset=iso-8859-1

I want to query the list about a reading
given by Steve Benson at Segue in NYC, on
20 February 1990. I'm sure that some of
you must have attended - I gather it was
something of an event, as, introducing
SB three years later at the Ear Inn,
James Sherry says "I never know quite what
he=B9s got up his sleeve. I=B9m still talking
about a reading he did several years ago
at Segue Space." - And says it with more
enthusiasm than is allotted the usual
introduction.

I have a cassette tape of the reading in
hand - but what an inadequate medium this
turns out to be, as I can hear SB writing
or scribbling as he reads, shuffling
papers, folding and even tearing them,
perhaps stapling things together or to
something else. A myriad of activities
attended with much laughter. At the end,
SB mentions that there are a good number
of rubber bands left over if anyone
wants them - !?

Now, what I want to know is, what is going
on at this very performative reading? Perhaps
more specifically, I'm interested to hear
from those of you who were there, or perhaps
at readings given by SB contemporary with
this one - in other words, to access the
"oral" tradition. Reading reports ten years
after the fact, if you like. If even a few
of you could generate some discourse or a
description - of the paper tearing, of Benson's
style and manner of reading more generally,
etcetera - that would be tremendously helpful.
I notice that much of what he does seems to
be improvisatory, but with some basis in
his published texts; at one point, he
says something about accomodating prior
works to the present situation.

What follows is a little snippet of SB's
remarks improvised during the reading,
which I've partially transcribed from
the tape. I've only given a small portion,
because I don't think I can do them justice
here, and in typeface, even with Benson's
very moving manner of speaking still
ringing in my ears. Not, at least, without
providing a substantial context, which
would be impracticable in this message.

thanks, Chris

Steve Benson at Segue, 20 February 1990:

And meanwhile there=B9s going to be language or
opportunities to speak that are strategically
and repeatedly avoided, and when you have a
climate like the sort of, um, revision, revamping
of the national consensus on what=B9s appropriate
in public discourse that, you know, we=B9re struggling
over and wondering how much to get worried about
it - um, I went to the movies the other night and
was seeing an avant-garde film where there was a
huge finger - at the point it was draped in cellophane
- and it made me completely aware how there was no
penis in this film and yet it was full of of phallic
instruments, as it were, that were like probing and
prodding huge - It was very close up and pools of
ink and paste and oils and water and stuff were
being shoved around by fingers and brushes and pens,
and so I wondered like is this film in effect
participating in a kind of metam- not metamorphos-
symbolizing the penis, in this case, and taking it
out like th- it=B9s not it=B9s in circulation because
it=B9s being represented, and therefore we don=B9t
need to talk about it? It seemed like there was a -
safe thing.

Hi Dodie,

In "Explosive Magazine" #7 -- Tim Griffin's "A Criticism" would be
interesting/fun to use in a discussion of the limits of description (or
language? or interpretation?). Perhaps. And anyway it is hilarious and
exasperating and wonderful. If you don't have it I'd be happy to send
you a copy for persual -- let me know backchannel if interested.

WRITING EXERCISES AND EXPERIMENTS FROM MICHAEL BOGUE

Some of the following experiments are one’s I have
done myself, to varying degrees of success, some I
have yet to do and some I will never do.  Let me know
how they work for you.

1) Mix stanza forms     -  sestina+villanelle=?  -
haiku+sestina=? -  pantoum+sonnet=?
2) Write prose poems of exactly 50 words each – no
more, no less.
3) Use a word processor and randomise a large amount
of disparate texts.  Divide each page into 4-5 columns
vertically, but read it off hoizontally.  Use a
hi-liter on promising lines.
4) Write letters of complaint to large corporations in
verse form.
5) Write slanderous gossip about yourself.
6) In your journal, write what you would like to dream
about before you go to sleep, then write what you do
dream about as soon as you wake up.
7) Translate your, or someone elses, poems into
another language and back again using a computer
translator.
8) Use a scanner and deliberately set a low
recognition scale to scan your poems into a computer.
9) Each day of the week focus on a single colour of
the rainbow.
10) Write listening to another poets recordings, try
to write opposite from them.
11) Do objects poems via Neruda.
12) Use the OED to find obscure words for your poems.
13) Alternate “I remember – I forget”
14) What is your favourite insect?
15) Complete a poem in screenwriting format.
16) What is in your refrigerator? Go door-to-door to
complete strangers houses asking to look inside their
fridges and write of what you see. (DO THIS AT YOUR
OWN RISK!)
17) Make a poem incorporating comments from your
school report cards.
18) Use your daily horoscope in the newspaper.
19) Write haiku on foggy, dusty or steamed windows.
20) Write haiku on post-it notes - leave them in odd
places.
21) Re-edit TS Eliot’s “Wasteland” from the original
via Pound.
22) Write a personal’s ad via Ginsberg.
23) Write a sequence of poems set half in dream and
half in reality along two columns and at some point,
switch columns.
24) Write a double monologue via Ashberry.
25) Create some new jump rope songs and teach them to
children.
26) Write spontaneous prose via Kerouac using a
computer.  Turn off the screen and don’t look at the
keyboard.  GO!
27) Sleep deprivation – fasting – drumming – dancing –
abstinence – sensory deprivation
28) Use Magnetic Poetry™ to create an epic poem.
29) A line from every section of the paper into a
poem.
30) Unpredictable reverberations of the psyche.
31) Avoid the most overused words of your own work –
even similes.
32) Propose a non-mythological alternative to the
theory of evolution in couplet form.
33) Create a surrealist, absurdist poetry based board
game.
34) Short meditations on each of the Major Arcana
Tarot.
35) Daily journals focusing on different materials,
nylon, plastic, glass, wood, etc.
36) Create a manifesto and repudiate it later.
37) Sestina using a different word appealing to each
of the five senses, plus the name of your
province/state’s capital as end words.
38) Standard operating procedures.
39) 1002 ways to beat the draft via Tuli Kupferberg.
40) What famous poet (living or dead) would you like
to take a swing at and knock flat on their ass? Would
you take a shot at their jaw? Gut? Liver?
41) Write a pantoum with lines taken from travel
brochures.
42) Dreams of animals
43) Your plea to the parole board.  Use statistics

1) Don't join the academy. No tenure. No grants. No
cushy workshops for MFA students.
2) Get 'em while they are young and make 'em drop out
of school. Kindergarten is not too early.
3) Zero tolerance for "anti"academic poets who are
"running around looking for love" (Allen Ginsberg)
4) Nothing wrong with academics, some of my best
friends are academics. But would you want your
daughter to marry one?
5) Get a real job, one that isn't too demanding.
Stripping is good if you've got the body for it. Or
find a wealthy patron who plans on leaving you an
inheritance.
6) Poetry is as cheap as it gets, the grants really
ought to go to visual artists who could use the money.
7) If you do wake up and find that you have been
co-opted by the Academy, create a scandal that will
get you out of your situation and insure yourself
legendary status.
8) Do not send your poems to university journals.
Small magazines are good, but zines are better.
9) Go on welfare, the best art grant ever invented. As
long as you have your library card you can have all
the resources you need.
10) Keep a copy of "Anxiety of Influence" by Harold
Bloom by your bedside table. Better than a
tranquiliser to help you get through those sleepless
nights.

Well, that was fun!  Nothing like a little ad hominem to avoid the issue.
I don't know who "we all" are who missed the point.  I'd
still appreciate a logical  argument (hell, I'll take a rambling rose) that
debunks
D's own.  Am I wedded to D?  No.  I'm wedded to logical argument. Surely
"we all" can do better than that tired American anti intellectualism that
leads
to parochial descriptions like "french poodle theories" (The Small Press
Review).  By the way, Lacan's daddy is Freud; Derrida's nearest relative is
Heidegger.  Derrida and  Lacan? Distant cousins at best.  Honey.

My guess is that he dropped the honorific as part of the shift from Black
Nationalist to Third World Socialist - which was, what, mid 70s? My
chronologies are muddled today.

But some cultural organizations and writers with a Nationalist tendency
continue even today to preface his name with "Imamu," despite his own avowed
preference.

When did he drop Imamu?  I saw him read in '94 and the program / ads still
read Imamu Amiri Baraka.

***What you should know to be in love with a poet
(with apologies to Gary Snyder)***

All you can about the preparation of Ramen Noodles,
the names of deceased poets you don't give a shit
     about,
the name of your neighborhood drug dealer.

the poet's sick senses,  with a paranoid yet eloquent

     mind.

at least one kind of traditional bullshitting,
rhetoric, politics, The Celestine Prophecy,
philosophy.

coffeehouses,
hives of scum and villainy, as Obi Wan Kenobi might
     say.

kiss the ass of the book publishers and eat Kraft
Dinner.
be fucked their filthy cocks (if they have one at
all).
fuck all the posers and poetic wannabes,
        who imagine their shit perfum'd and golden.

kinky games, musty used books, old cigarette butts,
the purvursion of 2 for 1 Tuesdays at Adults Only
     Video.

bordom, long dry hours of bordom while your lover is
caught in the fever of the muse.

the wild freedom of being broke, poverty
silent, involuntary incarceration, solitary

fake dangers, gambling addiction, sherry hangovers
leading to the edge of death.

>>... i'd recommend folks who hyperdescribe, like proust or...<<

Maria, I am a little fascinated by your use of the verb "hyperdescribe", particularly in relationship to Proust. Do you use it in the sense of "dismissivley gratuitous"?  It could be true that Proust was "hyper" in the nature of his compulsiveness to descriptively respond to any number of things or events within the incredibly range of his memory or the present. On other hand I don't think of most of his descriptive writing as gratuitous or indulgent in the manner of an ornament gathering tourist. To the contrary I find his descriptions, (clause by clause, sentence by sentence) as a means to unveil and get to the core of one issue or another. In cyber terms, if Proust's work is looked at as a portal, he puts most search enginges and web-sites to shame. I believe Kerouac also shared this kind of descriptive impulse with Proust.
(By the Proustian way - and I was ready to be disappointed - I really liked the new Proust film by the Brazillian director)

Cheers,
Stephen Vincent

Dodie --

I second Rilke's letters on Cezanne, as well as Bill Berkson's suggestions
of E. Bishop, MFK Fisher, and Fairfield Porter.  In fact, I've always found
art criticism interesting for the challenges it presents to description.  I
would add Ashbery's "Reported Sightings."

I would also add Joseph Mitchell's essay "McSorley's Wonderful Saloon" from
his collection Up In The Old Hotel (Vintage 0-679-74631-5), an essay so
vivid I feel like I have been to there.

And also, Marcus' speech from Act II Scene IV of Titus Andronicus.  The
stage direction reads "Enter...Lavinia, her hands cut off, and her tongue
cut out, and ravish'd."  Marcus comes upon her, and his speech is a great,
if horrifying, example of the limits, the inability of language to describe
anything so terrible.

Hope this helps.

Check out the novels of Jonathan Bayliss - Prologos, Gloucesterbook

Jonathan's books can be ordered from The Bookstore (yes, that's the name) in
Gloucester, MA.  (978) 281-1548.

I'd like to echo Stephen's comment on description in _Prologos_,
_Gloucesterbook_ and _Gloucestertide_.  Jonathan uses meticulous, dense
descriptions of place, process, social relation, history to conjure an
alternative world (of word) parallel to our own; that is, Jonathan's
imagined Gloucester (& U.S.) illuminate--in very specific ways--the other,
lived-in, Gloucester (& U.S.).  In these books as in others mentioned in
this strand description often reaches the level of virtuoso performance.

Of additional interest to the list, the books contain sketches of many
members of Gloucester's artistic community, veiled with slightly altered
biographies, including an Olson-like Ipsissimus Charlemagne.  Thank you
Stephen for putting me in mind of Jonathan's work once again.

Hello, Listees.

A colleague proposed today that a person couldn't qualify as a poet,
or a poem as a work of art, unless one could point to other works
of similar or greater value by the same writer. I tried, briefly and
unsuccessfully (after 7 hrs of grading) to dissuade him from this
horsechesnut.
Next time I see him, I plan to inquire his opinion of Chidiock Tichbourne's
single, affecting lament for himself the evening before his stature
adjustment by ER I's ax-whacker, but I wonder if anyone can
suggest some perhaps more persuasive examples of poets
known by a single poem (a short one: I tried a few long ones, but he cited
Poe's horseball that poems over 60 lines really combine shorter poems).
No haiku, please; no limericks or clerihews; nothing about puppies.
No returns without SASE. Reading fee: whatever you think right.

I think it would be interesting to try and track down descriptive
passages that don't end up describing the author, or challenge your
students to the task.

re hyperdescriptive and the above, I find myself going the other way and
trying to find a baseline for description, maybe because the
hyperdescriptive is so much about the writer or at least the writing?
Anyway, I keep thinking about things like driver's licenses and other
proscribed/formulaic shorthands that we all accept as descriptions. What
is the written analog of courtroom sketches (a defined/stylized/agreed
upon vocabulary)?

Old Grammars, New Contingencies
A Poetry Writing Workshop Considering Obsolescence and Newness in Method
With Lisa Robertson, 6 Tuesdays, 7-9pm, June 6-July 11 2000, $120
At the Kootenay School of Writing, Vancouver, BC

"The obsolete exists so strangely side by side with anarchy and newness."
-- Virginia Woolf

This workshop assumes the curious imbrication of style and subjectivity, of
convention and potentiality.

If, after Raymond Williams, poetry is "the process and the result of formal
composition within the social and formal properties of language", the
specific circumstances of this composition include an apprehension and
redeployment of the historical tropes that at least partially constitute and
limit any writing. History is not a dead letter, but an infinity of
energetic nodes awaiting reactivation. The subject, as it arises in the
temporal simultaneities and unlawful cohabitations of the writing process,
is radically unfixed. In this workshop we will test the extent to which the
historical is the necessary territory of the new.

We will read work by Gertrude Stein and Aristotle, Erin Mouré and Alexander
Pope; John Ashbery and Rousseau; and John Clare. Each week we will discuss
the work of workshop participants in relation to assigned compositional
exercises.

The workshop is geared towards practising writers with some previous
engagement in textual problems, pleasures and procedures.  Limited to 10
participants.

Please email statement of interest and/or writing sample to <lisar@lynx.net>.

I recall seeing a book called "The Describer's
Dictionary" but I have no inkling as to who wrote or
just how useful it is. I do remember it contained
descriptions from many fictional sources divided into
categories. Looked useful. Check out Amazon.com.

sometimes literature is such an enormous gift that one is glad to be
alive.


he takes on a pupil. a young man comes to him and he asks his name. the
young man gives his name, the same as that of the teacher. the young man
learns quickly; he is condescending, always wary. rumors develop in the
community. the teacher, who has always been morose, teaches the pupil
everything he knows. the teacher remembers similar events in his own
youth. the community begins to fall apart; there are two men with the same
name. the teacher banishes his pupil. that night, he begins to laugh.

such is the retelling of the story from Martin Buber, For the Sake of
Heaven.

what can be taught the bearer of the name? already worlds have been
created and destroyed. there is nothing to teach, nothing transcendent but
the sign which both carry. the gift of teaching ourselves, the gift of
nothing to teach.

you may know that the name of the teacher is Rabbi Jaacob Yitzchak, the
son of Matel, and the name of the student is Jaacob Yitzchak, the son of
Matel.

65 pps, paper   $8.00

now available from Hog Oil Press, 927 Rhode Island St, Lawrence, KS  66044

Poet and critic Stephen Ellis had this to say about previous publications by
Jim McCrary:

"There's a watchful, alert element that runs through all of McCrary's work:
its expression often takes a sarcastic nay sardonic twist yet the language
remains homen, to the point and too the bone.  It is the simplicity of
McCrary's verse that astonishes......"

Previous publications include:  West of Mass (Tansy); And/Or (eg books);
Recollection (Texture); Edible Pets (Tansy).  He lives in Lawrence, KS with
his wife Susan Ashline and continues working at the Estate of William
Burroughs as Office Manager and Archivist.

        aren't we sort of admitting

        of our work?



        Dear William,


        by basing the world as only market place you seem to forget what
poetry is and what it serves. In some ways the market place is all of us no
matter how confining an infinite space that is. This placing of poetry into
an index based upon sales is dangerous stuff. It is was a true marker
Jewel's _A night without Armor_ outdoes even our most successful poets. So
what does that infer? Jewel's going to save our soul with her quaint ruffly
posey just because a group of dull sixteen year olds find her words to be
thought provoking.
        Make no mistake there arfe always higher order rules in operation,
even when lower order is on strike. Poetry has no economies of scale! The
world does't need poetry! Some of us find it to be indespensible, an opiate
there for it takes on a greater elastisity. Poetry is not insulin. Poetry is

Would you rather Keats today or

Fundamental Concept in Poetry

        Study of Poetry involves estimating and valuing future emotional
flows
from stimulus provided at the writing from poet functioning in turn as
intermediary agent for said poem, creating in the self a manifold, of sorts,
to bear upon a reader at any given moment in the future a similar or greater
emotional prominence ... etceteras!

        The timing of these emotional flows are random and uncertain due to
taste
of and prevailing social conditioning of reading audience to individual
reader.

        The amount of these future emotional flows is uncertain

Poetry is not same as Accounting, not same as Finance

- Finance tries to maximize value, not accounting profits
- Accounting and Economics de-emphasize time and opportunity cost
- Accounting strives to measure and express historical events
- Finance looks to the future using data from the past

To achieve harmony

There must be at least one despicable inflow
and
one outflow of stuffed wonderfill (sic.)



you must compare emotion flows from similar points in time
How to compare?
POETRY AS AN INVESTMENT

Future emotional value
amounts to poem as investment
to grow after one or more periods earning some given rate of interest

Basically all this means is that if you put poetry under your mattress or
buy into thought as investment, you will earn and your investment, over
time, will grow.

First, how much poetry will you have after 1 year?
You'll still have your Keats and you'll be able to eat from it tomorrow

earn interest on that amount at 8%

After three years of course you will have
Keats x (1.08) x (1.08) x (1.08)

You begin to see a pattern here!

FV= PV (1 + i )^N
· FV = Future Value of poem read today
· PV = Present Value of poem in front of you
· i = the emotional rate per period
· n= the number of compounding periods

Note: Every timeline must have an inflow and an outflow.
That means one of these factors (PV,FV or i) needs to be negative.
(Look at it from bank perspective
Elliot's folly

So - can you make a decision now? Which do you prefer?
suppose we compare both amounts today rather than
10 years from now.

HOW WOULD YOU CHOOSE YOUR WORLD ?

When you compute future values, you're asking questions like:

        How to free a muse
        Nothings going to change my world

[Timeline]

Present value calculations enable the poetry
one needs to be deposited today
in order to have a target emotional amount n years from now.

Present Value becomes the value today of future emotions
discounted at some interest rate calculation

future value is just the opposite.

The process is of computation and the interest rate used is called the
discount rate

So, if you want to know
how much you have to invest today
to reach a life like Thoreau

look at the problem this way:

We know that for every poem we read today, we will earn annually on those
emotions

Suppose you invested in Keats today
would you expect its themes to haunt
your lungs those 10 years over

At what annual interest rate would you be earning?

Before performing calculations,
intuition should tell us something

                        Multiple Emotion Flows:

All emotions compound thereby forming a construct discounting periods are
not annual interest rates are usually quoted on an annual basis, but you
need to know how often interest actually compounds to make correct
calculations ...

Continuous Compounding:

Banks, Libraries, and other academic investing institutions often quote
continuously compounded interest in which the compounding period is
infinitely large.
Can't use former calculation when m = infinite!

A perpetuity is a special case in poetry
        that all authorship strives
It is a stream of thought
bound to incidental words seeking       finding         becoming
constant
continuing forever
tenderly                        down hallways

Since a perpetuity has an infinite number of meaning
we cannot easily compute its value by discounting Keats one measure

The formula simplifies to a formula as such:
e APR -1
(e = 2.718 - basis for natural logs)

InflaTioN iNcreAseS cost oVEr TiMe

Something that costs $100 today may cost $103 next year.
If you invest your poetry at 8% interest rate your poetry grows by 8%.

If, however, inflation averages 8% over that same period,
you have not increased your power by 8%,
you have just kept pace with inflation.
If you had not invested your poetry
and instead kept it under the mattress,
your words can buy 8% less
at the end of the year due to inflation.

So it is important to invest your poetry
to at least keep pace with inflation

at a minimum
and beat
if possible
inflation
As time goes on,

Time turns its back
on Maturity.

upon lesser criteria are decisions made

The woman is a model of the poem she represents

        There are no words for her only color

The woman is a model of the image she represents
Her voice travels on, or above, as music

        thus she is muse or the muse, herself
                or iconographic woman in guise of muse

the setting suns shatters over this pond
Virga blossoms water vapors for simple
dispelling clouds breathing fire, blushing
lumps of flesh reflecting this pond

a girl shed jeans for the guise of water nymph
(and I blushed for intruding upon her seeing herself
naked for herself deliberate for sex without dirty old
sex

The woman is a model trying to represent the world she is modeling

        The model means nothing         for it is only a model
        the world has weather patterns we see as seasonal beauty

        art cannot portray the world it lives in
        Therefore freedom is a muse kicking leaves

The muse is a vice seeking a vocation calling its voice music

when words collide ... the trumpet brings the wall down
a poem too defends music

                        and I am at your feet and I want you so badly I will
wait until you come
to eat blood from my veins and be drunk on life

** Call the Theater for reservations: 415-863-9834 **

We're closing our season with an evening that should not be missed by
anyone who cares about poetry.  *  ROBIN BLASER's readings in San Francisco
are legendary.   *  With his great friends Robert Duncan and Jack Spicer,
as a young man Mr. Blaser was at the heart of both the Berkeley and the San
=46rancisco Renaissances of the 1940s and '50s.  *  Since the mid-60s he's
made his home in Vancouver, British Columbia.  *  His collected poems, The
Holy Forest, is a primary text of our poetic era, a mystery work that
enacts the randon=E9e, a quest both romantic and "after the modern" that
wanders off at the same time in search of the real and the deeply
imaginary.  *  He will be returning to town following the world premier by
the Berlin Staatsopfer under conductor Daniel Barenboim of Sir Harrison
Birtwistle's newest opera, The Last Supper--with libretto by Robin Blaser.

*  Music, refreshments, and festivities will follow, so stay for the party. =

THE MoMA PICKET LINES: AN OPEN LETTER TO THE ART COMMUNITY FROM THE
PROFESSIONAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE STAFF OF THE MUSEUM OF MODERN ART

May 3, 2000

Dear Friends and Colleagues:

As many of you might already know, the Professional and Administrative
Staff Association of The Museum of Modern Art (PASTA-MoMA) is currently
on strike after a substantial majority of its members voted to reject
the Museum's final contract offer. To clarify the reasons for our
current actions we would like to introduce some of the issues at stake.

We, the Museum's curators, librarians, archivists, registrars,
educators, editors, conservators, and administrative staff, are asking
for a fair contract. Negotiations began seven months ago and have now
broken off, and we feel that we have yet to see good-faith bargaining
from the Museum. The issues in contention are basic ones, including a
modest pay increase and the security of our healthcare coverage.

The current starting salary for some 40 positions at the Museum is
$17,000 per year, and the median salary of all PASTA members is less
than $29,000. We have asked management to raise minimum salaries to
$20,000, but it has refused to make any increase over $17,510. We have
asked for a first year 5% across-the-board increase with 4% for
subsequent years, which was also refused. The salaries of nonmanagement
MoMA staffers are sufficiently low that each percentage point of pay
increase for all 250 employees in the bargaining unit costs the Museum
only $70,000, a sum it often earns in a single day through the sale of
admission tickets alone.

As for healthcare, the Museum has asked the union to forfeit its right
to negotiate with management over any changes to the healthcare package
that management may propose during the life of the contract=97a right that
is granted to unions by U.S. law. This proposal, if the union accepted
it, would effectively allow the Museum to cut back the staff's
healthcare at any time and to any degree without consulting PASTA as to
what the healthcare priorities of its members might be. The Museum has
denied that it intends to reduce the healthcare package, but it has not
made clear to us why, in that case, it wants the union to give up its
healthcare negotiating rights.

There are currently five other unions at MoMA, which represent functions
of the Museum including security, art handling, and housekeeping. Of all
the unions, PASTA has the lowest base pay, average pay, and median pay.
We are also the only union in which membership is purely optional, a
weakness that management has used to try to divide us. These facts merit
the attention not only of the Museum's management and our Board of
Trustees but of the art world at large=97all the artists, teachers and
professors of art and art history, all the professionals and trustees of
other museums and not-for-profit organizations, all the writers and
critics, and anyone who believes that art is a vital part of society.

We ask you to consider the ethical questions at hand. We are not on the
picket lines outside MoMA merely to discourage people from entering the
building. In fact this is a position that many of us find
extraordinarily painful and one that runs counter to every impulse that
brought us into our profession in the first place. We feel that we are
here to defend that profession's integrity. We are asking the Museum to
acknowledge our commitment and our contributions with something other
than words. Like any other field that exacts dedication and rigor,
museum work is a profession, not an intellectual hobby.

In a recent memo to the Museum staff, Glenn D. Lowry, Director, stated:
"We are determined not to let the strike interfere with MoMA's mission."
However, every professional staff member on the picket line plays an
essential role in shaping and preserving that mission. The quality of
the exhibitions, the catalogues, and the education and membership
programs at the Museum depends on us from conception to realization. An
exhibition on the scale of Making Choices, which just opened, could not
have been mounted without the extraordinary contributions of union
members working hundreds of hours of overtime without compensation. The
level of achievement at MoMA is disproportionate to the salaries and
security offered to its professional staff.

A principle is at stake. It is in the best interest of all who champion
art to speak out and urge the Museum to address these issues now. We
invite you to join our picket line. We ask that you send a letter or fax
to Mr. Lowry (212-708-9744) and to Agnes Gund, President (212-708-9415).
Most importantly, we appeal to you to help end this strike by
encouraging management to return to the table and negotiate in good
faith and with due respect for the Museum's professional staff.

Sincerely,
PASTA-MoMA/Local 2110

Hi All, Dodie your class sounds fabulous, what about Djuna B?
Did others receive Kenning's Cunning issue I think it is truly a feat of the
editors Patrick F Durgin, Renee Gladman, Jen Hofer and Rod Smith (whose term
submodern is beloved by me). They call it a descriptive checklist of
tentative politics, I call it a mobile document of participatory spatials
with things like Taylor Brady and Tanya Hollis's translucid commutes set to
location's sturdy tumble (and Joey, the college artist who sits by the town
art window of our town with his art, on the sidewalk), Sarah Jane Lapp's
transmutation of filmic portraitized sugar; all set astride "each plastic
visionary hope chest" (Yedda Morrison) and still room for "stock epithet[s]
of the nineties" (John Kinsella) not to mention "the first ancient
description of chronology" (Alexey Parshchikov) --

hard boiled novel:  what people really take most notice of is the
descriptions--and not so much the dialogue and plot--of course, he himself
had a lot of trouble with plots, so this may have been to cover a
weakness)

        some examples:

        Gray's Anatomy description

        Most Wanted Poster description

        Fashion description

        Life Drawing description

        Cubist Description

        Obituary Description

        Vita Description

        First Impression Description

        Rear view Mirror Descritpion

        Framed by Window Description

        Memory Description

        From a Photograph Descritpion

        From a Sound Recording a Visual Description

        Over Heard from Other Side of Aisle or Booth Description

        Back of the Head in a Theater Descritpion

        Shoes/Feet under Passing Subway/Bus/Car Description

        Occupation Description (Describe a person not in terms of
'character" but the character of the profession as evinced by dress,
mannerism,s gestures, tone of voice, facial expression . . . )



        Viewing Description (Open Coffin)

        Morgue Descritpion

        and so on---

        the same can be done, in varying ways--with landscapes, streets--

        These exercises can be used to think on questions such as what
does "capturing a person/landscape" mean . . .

        What is the purpose for use of descritpion?
        How does this effct what is used in/for the descritpion?

        It's relation to/with cataloguing?  With defining "types"?

        Parts of description in relation to/with the whole:  allegorical,
figurative, metanymocial, metaphorical, metaphysical etc.

        Figure Drawing & Figure of Speech


        Techniques from cinema, video, radio, sound recording, strobe
lighting, other lightining can be used.
        (Close-up/medium/long shot.  Montage.  Jump shot editing.  Slow
motion.  Black and white/color.  Silent/loud.  Voice over.  Direct
sound--its effect on notation to indicate tones, level of sounds . . . )

        Relation of the shape of the descritpion in words to its shpae in
sound, and in visual layout on the page.


        Direct Description:  i.e. the object/person seen at moment and at
same time described, notebook in hand.

        Memory Descritpion:

        Five Minutes Later--A Day Later--A Week Later etc.

        memory of the Memory Descritpion, using one's own previous memory
Descriptions, from Memory.

        Or from going over them again.


        These are a few examples.

        If one has to take steps to NOT be an academic poet,(or
anti-academic poet),  one must be
more interested in what KIND of poet one is presenting oneself to be (or
act, act out) than being a poet.

        The tyranny of appearances leading to the dictatorship of
descriptions?

        The image of being a poet and being a poet . . .

        And many have committed suicide . . .


        (Contributing to the image of being a poet, or of not being
permitted to be a poet . . . ?)

        (Or not wanting to go on being a poet or image of a poet?)

If you don't believe a science, don't misquote it

---

Will fuck for books, no weirdos

--

Is there nothing this bull market can't do?

---

Yet

            what if there's a perfectly natural
form, and God wants us to kiss it and talk dirty?


--

Many parts
of the distribution apparatus are
edible.

--

Not the right analogy
Not the right time to be getting all maudlin
I'm going to say something to you students and then disappear
Your names have luggage
I wouldn't dream of allowing you to leave here alive
Not the appropriate comparison
My job is to suggest the boilerplate sucks
But I want to be a liberal student
Of the art of war
Dressed well
Starving to death
Raised by _swans_
Dashed against holograms
Because the strain of living a lie becomes studded with the opals of minor
    aristocracy
Chinning my person
That's what's wrong with American education goddammit
Nobody has lips anymore
All everyone wants to do is rub money on their genitals
Hey I'm no exception
You get used to it
Actually it's not that bad
I'm training imaginary insects to eat away at my vocabulary

---

To become unhinged is to admit, finally, the existence of hinges.

---

It is necessary to fracture the logics of identity
without however becoming a burden on one's friends.

It is useful to raise welts on the unconscious hide
of metaphor, so that we can have fun.

It is important to get on television and stay there.

--

cops on ostriches swinging hams

---

Class violence at the level of the seedling.

--

Easier to fill out a form that's already replaced you.

I'm comfortable with my attention span.

            They look like

Emergency fire exits but actually


                They're weapons.

There is no such thing as American poetry

That PSA was so dense with information that we needed to separate it from
the next PSAs!

Spend Mother's Day sanely and safely with ELINOR NAUEN & MAGGIE DUBRIS at
the Zinc Bar this Sunday. Elinor claims she will be reading from Some
Other Floozie (alt. title So Late Into the Night). Quoth EN: "If my long
poem about Derek Jeter [whom she met this Tuesday], traveling, love (OK,
well, sex) & other adventures isn't draw enough, come for my
co-reader, the ineffable MAGGIE DUBRIS, who will read from her
astonishing &
beautiful new work, "Toilers of the Sea" (a collaboration with none other
than Victor Hugo)." The Zinc Bar, 90 West Houston (just west of La
Guardia Place) & DOWNSTAIRS, under the weird fur store.

BOOK PARTY for TEN PELL BOOKS on May 20th at 7 pm. Free admission AND
refreshments.

Bob Creeley Breakthrough

This is going well today
I mean the fingers typing
and the face smiling
and the breath going in and out

like a nice girl on a date
who for the first time removes
her blouse, but your heart

is pounding so hard you
can't actually
see anything
except a mental
image
of Robert
Creeley

--Bob, go away
so I can see this girl and do
whatever it is I'm supposed to
do. Your linebreaks
are making it
impossible!

--Ron Padgett, from _The Blind See Only This World: Poems for John
Wieners_, ed. by William Corbett, Michael Gizzi, and Joseph Torra.
Granary Books/Pressed Wafer, 2000.

[Party for Ron Padgett tonight, Thursday, at Teachers & Writers, 5 Union
Sq. West, 7th floor, 6-8 pm]

If accepted into the Vancouver Videopoem Festival, all successful
entrants will receive an honourarium, depending on receipt of funding.

Last year the Vancouver Videopoem Festival was the first Videopoem
screening event ever held in Canada. This hybrid genre, videopoetry, has
received little attention in our country despite being a creative field
of growing interest for Canadian artists since the 70’s. Vancouver’s own
Edgewise ElectroLit Centre Society is hosting this  annual event where
the cutting edge of this medium is explored and presented. Work from
Canada and beyond will give local audiences a survey of the
accomplishments in videopoetry in the last 20 years.

The Edgewise ElectroLit Centre is a nonprofit society whose mandate is
to exploit communications technology to widen the audience of Canadian
poetry and to give poetry, multimedia artists and youth the opportunity
to use, learn, and create with this technology. Videoconferencing and
online publishing are the major technologies that we work with. Our
electronic magazine can be viewed and heard at <www.edgewisecafe.org>.
Poets featured with audio include Adeena Karasick, Wayde Compton, bill
bissett and Sheri-D Wilson. Funding for our programs is received from
The Canada Council for the Arts, The BC Arts Council, The City of
Vancouver, Embedded Spaces, Dowco Computers, and Communicopia.

Co-produced with Video In Studios. For more information, please contact

dodie ,
 i think this is what was mentioned earlier-

Grambs, David. _The Describer's Dictionary: A Treasury of Terms & Literary
    Quotations for Readers & Writers_. ?:Norton. 1993.

also, for great short descriptions have a look at Canetti's _Ear
witness: fifty characters_ funny and inspiring each character gets a
little over a page. my favourite is The Name Licker.

i think someone mentioned Kafka i find Robert Walser's (an influence
on Herr K.) short fables exquisite and challenging. there is an amazing
one about laughter that i might just type up for this list if i can find
it. actually, i'm always promoting walser. that name a gain Robert Walser.

I guess it's time I broke out of my lurking, at least
a little bit.  Hi to everyone out there I know and
haven't been in touch with (Joe, there's been a letter
to you half finished in my notebook for months now).
I haven't done very well with the transition to
corporate life, I've lost the patience to read all
this email after spending the entire day at my
computer.  The nature of my company has turned my
attention span to nothing.

Anyway, back to my reason for posting again.  I ran
across Jerome Loving's bio on Whitman last night.  I
know this was probably all talked about already, but I
hope one (or 30) of you give me recommendations about
this book.  I decided to save my thirty bucks for at
least an evening and went on to the discount rack
instead.

Best,
Eryque

I'd love  a copy of this growing list of descriptions.  Maybe you could
"frontchannel" the list of everything contributed when the thread runs
out?

How about the Shield of Achilles ekphrasis in The Iliad and
Auden's poem of the same title as well, as a pair.

NoSprayNewz #13
May 11, 2000
PO Box 334, Peck Slip Station
NYC 10272-0334
(718) 670-7110 (No Spray Coalition hotline)
www.NoSpray.org

Hi Folks,

In a decision that will have far-reaching impact, the Environmental
Protection Agency this morning announced that it has reclassified =
Malathion
-- the insecticide mass-sprayed from helicopters last Autumn all over =
New
York City -- as a "suspected carcinogen."

This is an important victory for environmental activists. But don't =
applaud
yet. The City still plans to spray pyrethroids (Resmethrin, Sumithrin,
Permethrin) and other dangerous insecticides, some of which are also
cancer-causing, and all of which are extremely dangerous to people with
allergies, asthma, and immune compromised conditions. And we in the No
Spray Coalition plan to stop them. [See tomorrow's message for Update on
Lawsuit]

The pesticide containing resmethrin being used in NY City is
called Scourge (TM). It is 18% resmethrin, 54% piperonyl
butoxide and 28% inert ingredients. Piperonyl butoxide makes
the pesticide more effective by preventing insects from
detoxifying resmethrin. Piperonyl butoxide has also been
classified by the Environmental Protection Agency as a
possible human carcinogen. Manufacturers are not required to
disclose the inert ingredients, although they may be toxic too.=20

As environmental lawyer Matthew Chachere writes: "Nice to know how
effective Rudolph Giuliani's Health Commissioner, Neal Cohen, has been =
in
protecting public health. First he is the only health professional in =
the
City to testify in favor of the Vallone/Giuliani lead poisoning bill =
that
was rammed through the Council last summer; and then his department =
sprays
much of the City with a carcinogen."

Meanwhile, the City is tripping all over itself in its rush to defend =
its
actions. The NY Daily News (5/11/00) writes that the city never would =
have
used malathion to battle disease-carrying mosquitoes last summer if =
there
was even a hint the pesticide might cause cancer, Mayor Giuliani said
yesterday.

"We were told it was one of two safe possibilities that had been used =
for
many, many years," Giuliani said, anticipating that the Environmental
Protection Agency will declare malathion carcinogenic today.

"We were told it was safe in emphatic language by state authorities, the
federal authorities," he added. "Of course we wouldn't have used it if =
we
had been told anything different."

Stop everything. Hold the presses. Here's what Giuliani has said,
repeatedly, in response to our testimony at press conferences, community
boards and City Council hearings, letters to his office, requests for
information, Notice of Intent to Sue, radio and tv interviews, etc:
"There's absolutely no danger to anyone from this spraying. ... There =
are
some people who are engaged in the business of wanting to frighten =
people
out of their minds." (Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, Newsday, 9/14/99)

The City and the Office of Emergency Management STILL refuse to set up a
hotline for the thousands of people who'd gotten sick from the pesticide
spraying, or who will get sick from future sprayings, should we not =
succeed
in preventing them.

Last October, Mayor Giuliani also said that he'd been sprayed =
repeatedly,
with no ill effects.

This April he announced he'd been diagnosed with prostrate cancer, which =
is
one of the possible "side-effects" of contact with malathion.

The Daily News story went on to say: "For years, critics have warned =
that
malathion is a neurotoxic chemical that can attack the central nervous
system and cause respiratory, gastrointestinal and=20
neurological problems. While most authorities called the chemical safe,
spraying in Tampa left 200=20
people hospitalized with dizziness, nausea and flu-like symptoms."

Too bad the corporate media did not headline that story while the =
spraying
was taking place. Let's make every effort to get them to raise the hue =
and
cry over spraying us with Pyrethroids and other dangerous insecticides =
as
well.

No Spray Coalition

"It is impossible to refute a statement made in a poem: poetry is by =
nature
true and affords blanket protection to anything one wishes to say in =
it."

Clark Coolidge
On The Nameways: Volume I
Hard Press Books

Like Ashbery in his recent "Girls on the Run," Coolidge indulges in
fantasies of serious play among grownups, creating, in this long series of
short poems (for which there will, presumably, be a Volume II), a landscape
in which words themelves become characters, suggest psychological
dimensions, and in the end depart having pleased, perverted or deceived: "In
the Land of Oo Bla Dee / stooping distance from the Renal Tailpiece / wore
the uniform to the very edge / clasping of the mudguard // Progress
Hornblower was a liar [...] // But there's a lowline limiter / and Jimmy
Semester is lifting it / riffs and breaths all hauled away / a general
snuffing a total rolling / just no end to these shifting witnesses [...]"
("A Roll of Candy Dueling," 42)  There is something that is not so much
anti-intellectual but defiantly slap-happy about the way Coolidge uses
language, and it's not because he always quite sure what he's doing (as he
freely admits): "The Pillgollick has soiled himself again / stop fishing for
end rhymes / would you paint beer cans? / I laugh at myself in Backwardsland
/ is there a brain at the end of this line? / Tsathoggua!" ("Dashiell
Gorky," 64).  If the Americans could not be given credit for having invented
Surrealism, Coolidge proves that the basic premises of automatism --
separated from an overdetermined Freudian symbolism and/or card-carrying
Marxism -- still thrum as the undertone to our collectively scrambled,
consumerized and even infantalized consciousnesses, as he takes his
digitized bee-bop prosody -- there's a touch of Kerouac here though the
method is clearly Burroughs-paranoic -- to the people in witty, electric
doses: "The Indian on the penis / the sign of the only stable seating / in
this country // BRAP / but it seemed like to me it wasn't / as hot as it had
been / the porcelien fart had a flame embossed [...] / an umbilical wallet
it was / the engine on my father's hands / (bent)."  ("Kink," 13)   The
cumulative effect is of hearing a quirky, jazz-suffused, horny, literate,
art-induced, troubled, lazy, friendly, rhythmically polyglot, Stein-bobbled,
cranky and constantly energized mind-at-play, scribbling and scrambling
through several poetic registers while watching the television and keeping
an eye on the kids.  Fans of Coolidge might be disappointed that On the
Nameways doesn't extend beyond the exciting, nearly hallucinogenic writing
of his earlier collections of short poems, such as Solution Passages and
Sound as Thought, or that the depth of his imagination rarely goes as deep
as in his classics At Egypt or The Crystal Text, and at times doesn't rack
up its effects the way it could -- the more minimal poems, for instance,
suggest the early, objectivist Creeley, but Coolidge fails to go for the
kill with a stunning finish -- but for newcomers to this important American
poet, this is a grood, mostly entertaining, place to start.

Miles Champion
Three Bell Zero
Roof Books
68 pp.

Each page of this young English poet's first stateside collection
(Compositional Bonbons Placate was published by Carcanet in 1996) is
brimming with the conflicts of intentionality and chance, design and
improvision, or perhaps simply work and fun, but not in drawn-out
meditations so much as by well-honed linguistic breaks, taking the project
of the Surrealist explosion of the veils of reality to the level of the
word.  Champion takes his lead from the American Language poets, and his
poems sometimes resemble, page for page, works by Bernstein, Di Palma,
Andrews and Coolidge, but his attention to this heritage -- for him an
overseas import rather than "native" -- operaties as an engaged criticism of
the slumberingly conservative nature of English poetry in the century of
modernism.  But rather than take "innovation" as his guiding principle,
Champion creates an entire culture or sensibility that, for all of its
completeness and, at times, lyrical coherence (the metrical regularities of
the quasi-narrative "Clovis," for example, greet aesthetic closure at every
step), strikes always in the other direction, or as many "other" directions
as can be contained in these careful, spare poems: "Signs the ever / Water &
wine to form an oblong cut-off / Or baffle at social what's / That is, in
Hegelian terms, the scarf cigar / A man is than made / I think ex-Parisian
liver suit or difference / Perfumes the harder focus / Road or dog brains
rise / Light is eat / You is in pellet-type pole / The clearing colour sort
of adding the twig / & I found a kind of digital dried dill / Stick [...]
(untitled, 15)  Champion rigorousness, adeptness with staccato meters, and
learnedness measure up against any in the Language camp, especially during
their "heroic" phase, but because he doesn't cling to the principle of
author as originator, or even copyrighter, of his words or works -- such
that a Romantic or individualistic strain creeps in (this has affected a
number of second-generation Language poets) -- he is able to focus on the
central, universal concern, which is to make readers see and hear words.
His near-utopic faith in this project can bring on a Symbolistic,
quasi-religious undercurrent: "The nod / dis- / members the / tactile / echo
of / a solipsistic / gesture.  Diffuse / summa-.  I / mean, to / provide you
/ with layers.  (Target / fit / mists.) I / was in / the twenty- / four-hour
/ metaphor, laundering / an intense / & crystalline / hush."  ("Finishing
Touches," 45)  However, for all of his graceful maneuvering among the most
difficult postmodern practices, the spirit of community always peeps through
in the generous imagery and the sheer pleasure in perfoming language:
"Candour disposes the lustre / tinctures for what chance / the person's
mount or invisible taipliece / free brochurettes impressing the indefinite
fold [...]" ("Poem," 66).  Though a slender 68-pages long, the poems in
Three Bell Zero will remind everyone of what it felt like to read poems for
the first time, with excitiment and a sense of belonging and purpose.

Stephen Rodefer
Mon Canard
Hard Press Books

Author of books as diverse as a celebrated, idiosyncratic translation of
Villon (under the pseudonym of Jean Calais, Pick Pocket Books, 1968) to the
spellbinding Four Lectures (1982), recognized by many as a distinctive
masterpiece of Language writing, Rodefer has never been one to fit easily
into a method or recognized "voice" -- indeed, into a stable reputation.
His most typical form of writing, as exhibited in several small-press books,
has been the quick, elegant improvised lyric inspired by the writing of
everyone from Olson to O'Hara, Baudelaire to Stein, Verlaine to Patti Smith,
which is why this new selection of longer, more cumulative poems is
especially welcome.  In Mon Canard, Rodefer returns again to the large
canvas of Four Lectures, as each of the book's six poems explore
exhaustively a distinctive style: the short, linked prose poems (a la
Rimbuad's Illuminations) of "Daydreams of Frascati:, the Williamsesque
three-step in "Erasers" (which even sounds like "Asphodel" at moments) and
the more acrobatic "Arabesque at Bar"; the projective, satiric apostrophe in
"Answer to Dr. Agathon"; the high-flown erotic pun-machine in "Mon Canard";
and -- in a sort of wicked inversion, signifying his embattled relationship
to Language poetry itself -- the quasi-constructivist stanza of Barrett
Watten in "Stewed and Fraught with Birds."  This isn't to say that Rodefer
is derivative; on the contrary, he needs these forms to reign in the various
tones of address (mostly ecstatic, but often meditative and conversational)
that he exhibits and which, one senses, society will never be entirely
pleased with: "The ligaments / of your phraseology / will eventually get /
put to some truth test or other // and you'll be lucky / if anyone reads /
it with a big guffaw / or sneezes" ("Stewed," 114).  This poet, like the
modernists he most admires, and as distinct from the determinations of
postmodernist gesture, is railing for a concept of value when the old,
stable ones have vanished, mating duende with the suave anarchic
undercurrents of parataxis.  As a result, his use of reference resounds with
the need to shore up history and knowledge against personal dissolution: "I
am come to your cartop Ajax, waxing toward an invitation to an opening in
some hedgerow.  Our Leninist principles have toppled, to become fabulous and
Sylvan once again.  We are the last metaphysical activists in American
nihilism.  We demand a Pope from the Bronx."  ("Daydreams," 10)  Rodefer
presents something of the classic, Kafkian "description of a struggle" that
is rarely seen anymore since the paranoic has overwhelmed avant-garde
writing and deleted the agonic persona, it seems, entirely.  While some of
the poems, like "Mon Canard," broken into 14-line "sonnets" but without
their closures, can be faulted for a metrical repetitiveness and lack of
progression, the gesture of the effort can be appreciated for erecting
particular reading challenges when least expected -- i.e. in the course of
libidinous play and rhetorical directness.  I like the graphic page a lot.
Mon Canard presents in large strokes the depths to language and, most
importantly, the range of human feeling -- from the dark to the bright, the
indulgent to the ascetic -- that only a a poet-as-dedicated-free-radical can
provide.

Laura Moriarty
Nude Memoir
89 pp.
Perfect-bound
ISBN: 1--928650--07--4
Krupskaya

Something of a spiritual autobiography, a pragmatist's enunciation of
feminist issues of the body and love, a screenplay for a never-to-be-made
film, a sort of ambient wash (in the spirit of Stein), and a "poem including
history", Moriarty's latest book is a mature exhibition of the powers of
late modern, and perhaps early "new modern," writing.  The poem starts with
what would appear to be the central theme, a reflection on the use of the
nude in art and as metaphor, deriving from the privileged male gaze on the
female body: "The nude is given / The nude is not a woman / Who displays a
tendency to be naked / An artist keeps the whole game in mind / From her he
learns / Replaced by physical presence / "With eyes shut like a bride..."
(7)  This relationship -- often portrayed as one-sided in feminist writing,
but here complicated by the fact of Moriarty's power as an artist and
creator, and hence not a spokesman for the "victim" -- is torqued and turned
throughout the early sections, as gender roles are troubled and estranged:
"Diana puts together supsension systems beginning at 5 a.m.  Energy. Apollo.
The male nude.  The female worker.  Automobile.  Moves and comes to rest.
Potential movement.  The machine.  'Eyes shut like a bride..' (Adorno)
Stumbling into position.  Precision.  Accountability.  Exhaustion is the
steel of her eyes.  She is a real woman.  Paradise."  (11)  Themes
intermingle with no obvious regularity throughout the work, as it dips into
reflections on Duchamp's The Box of 1914, slavery in Haiti, Buster Keaton,
Nietzsche ("Supposing truth is a woman," from Beyond Good and Evil),
Moriarty's relationship to the late poet Jerry Estrin, and a figure called
"Kim" who could be a stand-in for Theresa Cha or Myong Mi Kim ("Her name was
Kim.  She was named for the war."), whose works -- part history, part
autobiography -- Nude Memoir resembles.  Like Pamela Lu's Pamela: A Novel,
Nude Memoir has a sort of fugal quality in its relationship to names, with
figures and ideas reappearing at later moments in the work, troubling the
relationship to normative narrative though the urge for anecdotal telling is
very strong.  But unlike Lu's book, which more clearly narrative, Moriarty's
writing is a sort of a quasi-paratactic shorthand which often breaks into
"poetry," linebreaks and all, and is perhaps weakened by a sense of stasis
that one senses after reading too many clipped, telegraphed sentences,
though she offers occasional commentary on what is happening: "Terrible
grammar. The spelling of the murderess.  Portable like poetry.  Her notebook
of lies.  A convoluted spirit invading itself like a false idea of the soul.
She stole from her victims.  They all became writers.  To say about her.  To
restate the obvious.  The disappointment.  The injury comes after pain.
Followed by long scrolls of fiction.  Women move through it.  Frantic
hieroglyphs.  Nothing moves fast enough.  Was she a mother or a monster?"
(45)  Perhaps this disembodied, somewhat monotone cadence is the most honest
way to create a poetics that avoids the masculinity or orientalism of a
single, judging perspective and the Faustian urge to horde knowledge, and
the low-intensity of Moriarty's writing, like ambient music, is pleasurable,
textured and full of detail and insight such that one is pulled along in
reading the book with trust and affection.  It is an advancement on the
modes of postmodern writing in that it is not troubled by a need to rise
above it's reader with top-down channelings of superior knowledge and
radical ideology (though knowledge and ideology are present), but rather
engages the reader in a competant, compelling and intelligent play of
meaning and language.  As Moriarty writes: "Commentary is what she provides.
In the form of an amused silence."  (72)

   Writing contains anarchy, breathes it out. I used to
   think "I bring chaos wherever I go" was a bad thing.
   I'm sorry about the neurosis part. You'll just have
   to get used to it. (I'm jealous of your objectivity.)
   The neurosis is a gloved hand that reaches up to
   cover my face.

   There's something strange inside me, a shadow figure
   with a wisp for a body, a brushstroke body, and face
   a hypnotic spiral. And feeling far apart from space.
   I quickly lose interest in my pubic hair, which hurts.

Image is inevitable and matters. It does matter what
"kind" of poet one chooses to become. Would you trust
your brain surgery to someone who didn't care what
"kind" of surgeon they were?
It seems to me, though as always I could be wrong,
that most "non"academic poets are all too quickly
tamed by the Academy. It is not simply a matter of
image - although image does matter, otherwise why
would I spend so much time in front of the mirror
before conducting a poetry reading? - but one of
hypocrisy.  This seems a uniquely North American
issue.
As for suicide, far more psychiatrists and police
officers commit suicide than poets. Once you have been
co-opted by what is often called "The System" it seems
to reduce your chances of survival.
What I was saying - with tongue firmly placed in
cheek -  in my list of ways to avoid becoming an
Academic poet is that we should allow ourselves other
options.
Much as was done in all the preceeding centuries of
human life on this planet.
As for myself, I still haven't settled the issue in my
own mind. Nothing gets one the jobs one needs in this
culture like that little piece of paper that says
"degree".
I am considering two options.
The first is going the learning distance route, which
may help me avoid many of the "politics" and allow me
to maintain a level of independance.
The second would be to get a degree in something
totally unrelated to poetry, literature or english.
Perhaps even a general liberal arts degree. Charles
Olson was on to something when his poetry lectures
were about archeology.
I am disturbed at just how easily the various
movements are digested into "The System" (the
Surrealists, the Beats, the New York school, LANGUAGE,
multiculturalist).
Yet at the same time I cannot lie. I want my poems to
last forever. I want my name to be a shining light of
pure inspired genius to all that follow. I don't even
want to have to work at it. Hey, its my ego and I can
do as I please with it.
The only hope it seems I might have of having my poems
survive until the end of time would be in the dusty
halls of academia.
Already I hear the howls of protest.
"Do it for the art! Love of poetry should be your only
motivation!"
It is.
It isn't.
I suspect that my poems, unpublished and known only to
a few, are as much a project of ego as anything else.
I'll never be a movie star, so hey, I'll be a poet.
I am not playing games. Poetry is not therapy. It has
not made me a better person. It will never make me
wealthy, sexy or have minty fresh breath.
All the great movements of poetry, the "best minds of
my generation"(Ginsberg) began as a reaction against
the Academy.
The "official verse culture" (Bernstein) that I can
barely read without nodding off and then I play the
game of "Count the MFAs" on the contributors page.
As for me, I dropped out of high school. I used to get
low marks because I would cut classes to read in the
library books that were of interest to me. I work in a
job that makes just over minimum wage with many people
who have university and college degrees. I often have
their level of knowledge. I do not have their crushing
debt loads.
The MFA programs have become a pyramid scheme. Poets
teaching poets to teach poets. Eventually, it will
collapse.
I intend to leave the pyramids to the slaves.

***********************************************
>>If one has to take steps to NOT be an academic
poet,(or anti-academic poet),  one must be more
interested in what KIND of poet one is presenting
oneself to be (or act, act out) than being a poet.
The tyranny of appearances leading to the dictatorship
ofdescriptions?
The image of being a poet and being a poet . . .
And many have committed suicide . . .
(Contributing to the image of being a poet, or of not
being
permitted to be a poet . . . ?)
Or not wanting to go on being a poet or image of a
poet?)

Dodie--Sounds like a wonderful premise for a course, and people have
already made a lot of great suggestions, many of which resonate with me.
I too remember the baby in *White Mule*, some of the (usually bad) sex
in Henry Miller, and many passages of great Benjaminian topography.  I
also think of Geertz's "Notes on the Balinese Cockfight" as, among other
things, a masterpiece of description, and i've never forgotten the
amazing phenomenological record of a sunset in Levi-Strauss's *Tristes
Tropiques*, which runs to seven or eight pages.  And of course the whole
tradition of 18thC & 19thC landscape poetry and painting is relevant,
along with the highly influential notion of the "picturesque" out of
Gilpin, etc.  Along these lines, Wordsworth wrote a prose "guide" to the
Lake country that's still in-print for tourist-use today.  In the
American vein/grain, so much Thoreau comes to mind it wld be difficult
to choose--but I guess I might take the stunning "sand-foliage" passage
from the "Spring" chapter of *Walden*.  Also much Whitman.  Taking a
quite different tack, there's the whole literature of description-as-
"testimony"--thinking here especially of Reznikoff, both *Testimony* and
*Holocaust*.  So there's a few off the top of my head--and I've just
realized that for some reason i didn't mention any women.  Stein's
*Tender Buttons*, already mentioned, wld definitely have my vote, as wld
Hejinian's *My Life* as a kind of follow-up.  Also many marvelous
passages in Virginia Woolf, as, for ex.,
the tide-pool as microcosm in *To the Lighthouse*, and many, many poems
by Lorine Niedecker. Etc Etc

I hope you'll post your syllabus once you've gotten it together.

I have never seen a "logical argument" that shows why Derrida is right
either. Mostly it's just appeals to his authority ("As Derrida has
shown...").  Derrida does not really proceed by logical argument either,
but by an assertive rhetoric. You have to first believe that there is this
monolithic thing called Western Metaphysics that somehow remains the same
thing over many centuries, kind of everywhere and nowhere at once. Is it
in our brains? Are there people (non-Western presumbably) who don't have
it?  Is it in our language?  Are there languages that are more or less
metaphysical?  These are not rhetorical questions:  I'd really like to
know!!  If we can't answer questions like this, what is there to debate
logically?

As far as anti-intellectualism:  it is just as anti-intellectual to accept
Derrida without understanding the philosphical background (of course, no
one on this list would do this, but I have seen it done many times) as it
is to reject him because he doesn't convince you.

Are we talking about ekphrasis now? then dont forget the Philostratus'
"Imagines", the big collection of descriptions (ekphrases) of paintings &
sculptures, or Vasari's "Lives" or Bellori's "Lives" of artists, full of

show "Democracy Now" will run excerpts from A MATTER OF LIFE AND DEATH,
a reading by actors and comedians in Los Angeles on the occasion of
Mumia 911, the National Day of Art to Stop the Execution. Edward Asner

dodie,

perhaps a look at something more lighthearted? -- like Turgenev's
'The Portrait Game.' Parlour game where one player produces a
drawing, and the other players write short accompanying character

The gag-men said to the Biograph Girl, we got to get some Keystone Cops,
half the extras are on a break, the Fall Guy ran away with the Script
Girl, and we have a film to make! The Continuity Girl called for Kelly
L'Impossible, more Sex Appeal than BB. The Foley made the horse carry her
in, Continuity said, it's a silent film. See The Silent Film by Sidney
Sheldon. What makes this film so special? Absolutely silent, filmed in
Victor Sound, a single Foley Hoofbeat Enlivens the action. One waits for
this marvelous sound of a Hoof against stone, which is when Kelly L'Im-
possible comes into the Studio. The gag-men are Astonished by this Make-
believe, One can only Wonder how Beckett's Film ever Survived such
Astonishment.

La Divine, one of the true Bathing Beauties of the Celluloid World, stars
in Dolly-Shot, a short Moving Tribute to L'Impossible, known as The Film
Within the Film. L'Impossible stars Marmel d'Estoire, best known for her
Trilby to Svengali's Edison. Dolly Shot is shot in Cinerama, temporarily
expanding the Aspect Ratio of The Silent Film to fulfill Dolly-Shot. One
can only Wonder how Gance's Napoleon ever Survived such Cinemagic!

See !!!!!THE!!!!!SILENT!!!!!FILM!!!!! at a Theater Near you! Travel to a
Theater Equipped for Sound! You will not be Disappointed.

Subject: m&r..recieved wisdom or nepotism revisited


It takes a paricularly black/withered heart to criticize a review of a
beloved blind buddhist monk's poems by the bright energetic young
scion of berrigan son. Let's have a go...Lead review Poetry Project
Newsletter Feb/March 2000...Anselm Berrigan on Philip Whalen..

Given the speeding up of stuff, it now only takes 21 years..for the
avant-garde to harden into the blood squeezed academy..Whalen's
cultural patter...tho sometimes wonderful...often is tendentious,
tedious and buddhist blah blah blah..."There's not an owl in the world
who thinks or knows/ I am an owl"...get the double verb as  if
reiterarting banality to no real effect is.....if the owl can;t think
he can't know and if he can't know he can't think..but if the poet can
blather he can blather on...

If Mr young Berrigan would just stick a sharp object into his elder's
heart he might find some blood there...it's a tough spot in a tough
family bizness...let me quote once more.."There's a tendency in
literary circles to overplay the importance of lineage and influence
of a long-standing trend that perpetuates the myth of writer-as-figure
looming over time as well as ordinary lives.  Whalen's tones are
utterly resistant to creating such authority..."

If he would have just added the 'non' to resistant we'd be on common
ground. Force is useful in the present...unforce, as the Buddha
teaches, goes a long way further....between the shout and the joke
there is only a difference of temperment and intelligence...beware of
those of who want what;s good only for you...it's like fighting with
air and colored water..

The teen age hacker programming the dream..the rapper sputtering
ebonics...the electric word outside this cultural exchange...welcome
the future, e-poet them vowels......DRn..

I tried to take notes in class today but got distracted by squirrel climbing
tree. Below are notebook entries. Can someone else fill me in? I wasn't paying
attention, the discourse was not very exciting tho Teacher thinks he or she is
being funny.

1) Brief book reviews are interesting subjects to criticize

2) Irony & humor: only a jerk would do this, but it's fun (ergo funny) so....

3) the "avant-garde" is something that hardens and can be squeezed (like
toothpaste)

4) Stuff "speeds up", is worth watching; axe ground against academy is grounds
for poetry chat

5) Buddha: new figure of influence to cause "anxiety"

6) "DRn"-- I didn't catch the name; can you spell it for me?

"So please trash your principles for just a few
minutes and buy it there if you can't find it elsewhere."


Rebecca Wolff said this a few days back and I've been mulling it over, it
stuck in my head as an unintentional articulation of the crux of a paradox
between pragmatism and idealism/utopianism.  A paradox from which (from
where?) I tend to fall on the (perhaps more untenable) side of the
utopianism.  For me, the very choice of a certain kind of poetics--that may
be favored here--as a fall on the side of hopefulness and deliberate
naivity.

I think the "do what you have to" of Rebecca's plea is a  popular sentiment
these days but it still strikes me as oxymoronic--the notion of a small
break from a principle.  Like taking just a little drink or a little job for
a big internet company (as I do).  It was odd for me to be politely
entreated to do so here on this site (despite its many frustrations for me
through the years, those off-hand comments that sound so archaic and yet
there they are).  That is, to take a break from ideology/commitment to an
ideal, when so much of the culture is demanding we do this all the time in
order to just pay the rent.

And this particular principle happens to be my devout vegetarianism. So,
until this city once again supports small stores and working class business
(affordable commercial rents, uninflated by superstores), I'm going to be a
stickler even if it makes me an backward-looking idealist.  In other words,
I'd rather go without.

As a brief follow-up to that thread, I've appended below
(with the permission of the writer, Anna Reckin) what I
think is a lovely, brief attention to Fanny Howe's
reading here in Buffalo this last April, with also some
mention of Robert Kocik's appearance the previous month,
and that of Miekal And and Liaizon Wakest at the digital
poetries panel at the New England MLA - held this year
in downtown Buffalo, in the snow.

A carefully paced, plain, almost matter-of-fact quality to Fanny Howe's
reading: often three stresses a line, clearly marked. Many monosyllabic
words, especially at the stresses; and their slightly off-beat
irregularity gives it a taut/torqued feel, a tension between inevitable
and striven-for. I don't have enough notes of examples (feel
self-conscious about taking notes OF poems as they're read, though
writing with/against them, or drawing (sketching Kocik's exquisite
wooden triple helix while he spoke about "fit" - that sculpture a
paradigm for the poem, a twisting-out and also balance) or making notes
of what the writer says "outside" the poems seems different somehow)
and I can't read some of those I do have. The following quote moves
on a step, perhaps, from what I seem to be saying:

    "and concentrate on the consciousness the sea comes out of"

- here a reaching towards those four stressed monosyllables at the
end, a kind of resolution of the variations that both settles and
twists outwards?

I was fascinated by her gestures, which she stopped every so often as if
suddenly self-conscious of them: tip of right-hand finger and thumb
pressed together and moved outwards (left to right, as in reading, but
also away from her), pointing the stresses. Pointing, perhaps, to that
other text, running along in time with her voice, but invisible to the
audience. (I don't think anyone had a book, was following on?)

An aid to herself, in her reading, as some people sway or pace back
and forth (Miekal And at NEMLA doing this, weaving his phantasmagoria
of cybertext and cybersound (mediated by Zon!) and finally walking
round us, bringing us in that directly . . .) but also expressive to
us - hence my feelings of being disconcerted when she cuts herself
off? The finger and thumb-tip together give the effect of precision,
but also make a symbol for hand holding pen or pencil?

And sometimes, especially when the vowel sounds were more open ones
("eehh" or "eye"), or when there seemed to be a kind of opening movement
in the poem, the wrist turns and the hand opens and moves up a little in
an outward gesture.   "A circular turn" and the hand draws a little
circle.

She reads sitting down, behind a table. It's not always easy for me to see
her. Each line is pinned up, carefully, by its stresses, then let to
float away.

Dodie et alia,

This has been one of the better threads in some time. Lots of good
suggestions. Whenever I've done anything around this issue in a classroom
setting, I've always tried to tease out a distinction between de/scription,
of which I most definitely approve, and de/piction (attempting to make the
writing itself disappear so as to render the referred world shimmering with
presence) around which I have a much more problematic relation.

Melville & Kerouac's Visions of Cody are for me key acts of description. As
is the essay "Sunset" in Levi-Strauss' Tristes Tropiques (an extended
attempt to describe a single sunset to unveil the constructedness of the
linguistic process). That, in fact, is the text I ultimately return to,
though I'm not certain if it's currently in print.

Bravo also to the person who suggested Ponge's Soap, though I'd've
recommended Notebook of the Pine Woods myself.

works of non-fiction, and anthologies.

The first is the long awaited first volume of
THE PIP ANTHOLOGY OF WORLD POETRY, VOLUME 1 edited by Douglas Messerli

Influenced in part by Jerome Rothenberg's and Pierre Joris's groundbreaking
20th century poetry anthology in two volumes, POEMS FOR THE MILLENNIUM: A
BOOK OF MODERN AND POSTMODERN POETRY, publisher-editor Messerli began in 1995
to edit his own international anthology. Enthused by the range and vast
numbers of wonderful poets writing in all languages, Messerli determined
to pubilsh three volumes of about 1,200 pages each. But as his research
cont8inued, he came quickly to realize that even a project this vast--
one of enormous expense and a near-impossible commitment of time and
resources--would not sufficiently reveal the panopoly of world poetry in the
20th century. Messerli began publishing more international poetry through
his presses Sun & Moon and Green Integer, and in 1998 he founded the Project
for Innovative Poetry with an advisory board of major international poets
and critics to explore ways to publish world poetry in English. To achieve
the publication of his omnibus anthology, he decided to publish two volumes
(containing 20 or 21 poets) each year until he had completed his task. He
now foresees this series to comprise about 50 volumes ultimately.

The first (now available) contains work by Rafael Alberti (Spain), Ingeborg
Bachman (Austria), Ruben Dario (Nicaragua), Gunter Eich (Germany), Gunnary Ekelof
(Sweden), J. V. Foix (Spain), Angel Gonzalez (Spain), Jorge Guillen (Spain),
Hagiwara Sakutaro (Japan), Hayashi Fumiko (Japan), Frigyes Karinthy (Hungary),
Artur Lundkvist (Sweden), Jackson Mac Low (USA), Osip Mandelstham (Russia),
Joao Cabral de Melo Neto (Brazil), Henri Michaux (Belgium), O. V. de Milsz (Lithuania/
France), Agnes Nemes Nagy (Hungary), Amelia Rosselli (Italy), Rocco Scotellaro (Italy),
and Takahashi Mutsuo (Japan).

Each volume contains biographies on each poet, as well as a listing of books in the
original language with city and publication date, a listing of translations, and
a fairly large sampling (4-10) poems of each poet.

This series will attempt to show what Messerli sees as "an energetic and often
uncontrollable beast of language upon whose back the reader is taken to worlds
that exist only in thinking itself."

Finally available is
READINESS / ENOUGH / DEPENDS / ON by Larry Eigner

A few months before his death in February 1996, the great American poet, Larry Eigner,
contracted with Green Integer to publish a new work of poetry. Edited by Eigner's
friend Robert Grenier, READINESS / ENOUGH / DEPENDS / ON has been long awaited by
the growing readership of Eigner's poetry. It is a work that gracefully accepts
death, and, by virtue of its very testament to the life around, eiterates Eigner's
continual engagement with life.

Dear Listafarians,

Tom Clark's review of my book HOTEL IMPERIUM appeared in the San
Francisco Chronicle yesterday (May 14).

It's also online, although line breaks in quoted poems are lost in the
web version:

http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2000/05/14/RV62156.DTL

A few excerpts for those without web access:

"With a bright humor and a sharp, critical intelligence that have
attracted notice ... 'Hotel Imperium' ... brilliantly deconstructs and
reconstitutes the cultural myths of the Nixon-to-Reagan decades.

"The complication and beauty of Loden's comic writing is in the nuances
and gestures of meaning expressed in her word choices, tones and
implications. Here, in her poem 'The Death of Checkers' ... is an
example of Loden's carefully angled and modulated verse--clean-hewn and
economical throughout, yet generously elaborated at all the right
moments...

"Boldly invading territories where most 'art' poets seem to fear to
tread, Loden exploits her subjects' history, politics and pop culture,
subtly deploying them to express displaced concerns, tricking out these
shopworn icons in attitudes and urgencies that are very much of the
moment...

"Loden's strength as a poet, then, is this sort of subversive conversion
of kitsch into starkly lit truths of history...

"Good poems can still offer the best kind of cultural criticism,
as Loden's do, articulating our deep and simple responses to the icons
by which history will define us."

Following Ron's lead on de/scription - de/piction
        I wd add that in the classroom the problem of writing a description
of a painting (or other "visual" artwork) is what counts as description --
in other words the problem of constructing a written description comes down
to a question of what are the protocols for the description.  What are the
protocols for the descriptions of poems wd also be interesting to discover.
        There is a range of answers beginning with the most compact -- a
title (as in an inventory) -- then an extended title --  then a summary (as
in summaries of periodical articles, or of books) -- & then the kind of
description that is more openly linked to an analysis & discussion of
values.

While poetry is a vague style, a motion/motor/
monstratium, I have chosen to ally myself with the
Huns, the barbarians at the gates, in order to hasten
the immanent Messiah.
To wit, I have therefore projected my sexual
organisations upon a huge uberbomb filled with the
confetti of every poem ever penned, poems obtained by
the telepathogenic tachyon travel device that scans
history and futurity for all poets and records all
there works, places them in alphabetical order in mass
data bases and printed off on dot matrix dominatrix
printers in alphabetical order to avoid New
Historicist error and all names erased with each poem
being given an equal footing. Good&bad make no
difference whatsoever.
I intend to blow my PObombs over the Earth blanketing
each area of the earth equally realising most of them
(80%) will be lost to the oceans, the rest will mostly
blank uninhabited areas, tundras, deserts, woodlands
and urban disaster areas in the wake of 90s
downsizing.
Perhaps 1% of 1% will be discovered. Perhaps 1% of one
1% of those will be appreciated. Less than 1% of 1% of
those will be understood or worth appreciating.
The End is Nigh.  The Age of the Poem is at hand.

Thank you, Rachel. This has been bugging me too. Do publishers not have any

Folks might be interested in L. Scalapino's take on Whalen in her
newish book whose name I am characteristically blocking.

Meanwhile Mr. B. does seem to not understand the owl, which is a

Contact: Pat Davis of Leonard Peltier Justice Coalition,
202-518-7781

News Advisory:

Nobel Peace Laureate Rigoberta Menchu will join acclaimed
author Peter Matthiessen, Amnesty International representatives
and Ernie Stevens of the National Congress of American Indians
to press the United States government to grant parole and/or
clemency in the case of Leonard Peltier.

They will speak at a press conference scheduled for 10 a.m.
Wednesday, May 17, at the Washington, D.C. offices of
Amnesty International, 600 Pennsylvania, SE Washington D.C.
Peltier is a Native American leader who has been
incarcerated in the United States for 24 years, following
his highly controversial conviction for the murder of
two FBI agents. Despite disturbing evidence of FBI
misconduct in the case, including the coercion of witnesses,
the intentional use of false evidence and the concealment
of a key ballistics test reflecting his innocence, Peltier
has been denied a new trial and is long overdue for
parole. He has been recognized by numerous human rights
organizations, religious leaders and Nobel laureates as
one of the United States' few political prisoners.
Domestic and international pressure is mounting for his
immediate and unconditional release.

The press conference will be followed by a congressional
briefing from 2-4 p.m., May 17, Rayburn House Office Building,
Room 2358, sponsored by the offices of U.S. Rep. John Porter
(R-Ill.), co-chairperson of the Congressional Human Rights
Caucus. The witnesses will include survivors of the Pine
Ridge Reservation "Reign of Terror," which took place
from 1973-1976. During this period 64 Native American
members and supporters of the American Indian Movement,
or AIM, were murdered on the reservation. Despite a
massive FBI presence at the time, there was no adequate
investigation and no charges were ever brought for these
killings. Menchu and Native American leaders from the United
States will also speak on the case.

Just want to send a brief post to celebrate the quite extraordinary reading
some 35-40 of us attended the other night at Small Press Traffic/New
College. Camille Roy, announcing she would be reading a 'pot-pourri' of
poems and prose pieces, began with an apparently autbio recollection of
working in a massage parlor, but just where we feared (or throbbed for) a
True Confession, adroitly took us away from that into a series of
writings/musings on resistance in a complicit society,--may she forgive my
abstraction if that wasn't where the details pointed. Also, at this point
in the evening, either I was having mike-trouble, or the mike was.I lost
some of the words. When towards the close she fetched us back to the
massage parlor,  it was a shock to be brought back to what I at least had
forgotten, the point of outset, and to see how the various writing in
between, was informed by that outset and its conclusion. This was a bold
venture, this casting of such different poems upon the waters of an
audience's attention, so all the more elation as one then perceived the
gamble romping home.  I regret I dont have the title of what she was doing;
perhaps Kevin Killian could help here?

Even or especially poetry readings are visual affairs, and Camille Roy's
outgoing, strong-bodied blonde beauty found a fine match in the next
reader, Melissa Wolsak of Vancouver. Reading from her long poem "Pen
Chants," she was never still, slow-dancing at the rostrum with serpentine
grace as she unwound her remarkable series of words and phrasings, a
dark-haired, sibylline presence, heartful voice somehow encouraging the
witness to stick with it as line yielded to line and a world where subject
is followed by predicate was occluded by moment upon moment of language. We
had been told in the Killian/Bellamy intro that Wolsak is a jewel- and
gold-smith by trade, so maybe that is why I came to regard this writing as
a matter of great tensile strength inlaid with gems---words either
neologisms or Latin, Greek or of other dispensation, that, inviting
contemplation, diverted the quest for continuity. I think this considerable
tensile strength is due to its refusal to conclude, except that each phrase
was conclusive. More telling, maybe, to repeat what someone said to me
afterwards : "It was like a prayer." And that reminds me that Wolsak's
poetics essay, _An Heuristic Prolusion_ , concludes :"For me, the urgent
question is..'do we have a prayer?'" "Pen Chants" is the answer to that.

A friend's body was found in March. To the discoverers--his co-workers
(itinerant, migrant grooms and horse-walkers, stall cleaners, horse-shit
shovelers at the back-stretch of Pimlico; other homeless junkie
alcoholics
among them)--they knew he had died in the night or early morning because
they had seen him earlier in the evening.

To the Police, the indeterminacy of cause relegates the case to the
homicide
detectives who interview the living and wait upon the prophecy of the
"medical examiner".

Forensic pathology is more severe than its televisual clichés.
"Identify"
the body. Determine cause. Because the evidence of the rendered body too
was
indeterminate, small bits of brain and liver are shaved off and sent to
the
laboratory. An aural and written record are matched to the exercises
upon
his body. It is more than the epistemology of journalism. Thinner,
harder.
More than the epistemology of the late-imperial archive of all our
administrative accounts. A balance of bureaucratic inertia, untoward
efficiencies of language, proliferating meaning production, a
weightiness
that sustains desiccated souls and other superorganics of history and
sadness. A buttress to belief in prosody with no need for its erasure
for
the aperture of discharge, the vomitory, will neatly and precisely hold
our
beliefs while we take our leave.

A death certificate was issued. Needs the signatures. Lethal Toxicity of
substances. Heroin and alcohol and prescription anti-psychotics, no
romance.
Nothing more for narrative sake, for he was a known vagrant. Foul play
ruled
out.

49 years old. He used to paint and do donald duck imitations at great
length. That's it. His mother wanted him buried with his father. So we
took
the ashes to Burlington. Not an embalmed heart nor a reliquary.

Description mourning: Warren.


****

Another describing thought today upon returning from the southeast coast
of
iceland and reading Halldor Laxness' _The Atom Station_: The beautiful
NATO
radar array now frames my view of the North Atlantic from of the ruins
of
the meditation rooms that the Irish monks who preceded the Norse left
north
and east of Hofn.

David Cameron and Jo Ann Wasserman will be reading at Blue Books this
Wednesday, May 17 at 7:30. Blue Books is part of the New College of
California and is located at 766 Valencia Street between 18th & 19th
Streets. Oh, and that's in San Francisco.

David Cameron (that's me) is nearing completion on a complete false
translation of Charles Baudelaire's Les Fleurs Du Mal. Forty of these false
translations have been published previously in two collections, Flurries of
Mail and Dirty Mom. In honor of this reading he and Brenda Iijima have
collaboratively published a limited edition book of Brenda's photographs an=
d
David's false translation of Baudelaire's sequence Le Voyage.

Jo Ann Wasserman=92s work has appeared in journals including The World, Grand
Street, and Blue Book. From 1992-1997 she worked in multiple capacities at
the Poetry Project at St. Mark=92s Church, including curating the Wednesday
Night Reading Series. Wasserman=92s chapbooks include what counts as proof
(Sugar Books) and we build mountains (a + bend press). She is the managing
editor of How2, an online journal of innovative writing by women.

Chances to see 9x9 characters recently featured in the 9x9 comic book,
6,500:

1) TODAY, TUESDAY, MAY 16TH:  Camille Roy, Gene Truex, Anne Stone, Craig
Foltz, Yael Schonfeld, Laura Walker, Steve Hemenway, Cassandra Bramucci,
Cheryl Burket, Denise Newman, Candace Moore, Tim Kahl, Daniela Koromza
and Katie Degentesh read at the release party for the Spring/Summer '00
issue of Fourteen Hills at SFSU's Poetry Center (Humanities Bldg., Room
512), 7 pm.

2) TOMORROW, WEDNESDAY, MAY 17TH: David Cameron and Jo Ann Wasserman
read from their poetry at Blue Books, New College, Valencia at 18th,
7:30 pm. Come. There will be singing. Plus a special guest appearance by
a cartoon character whose degree of American fame disqualified him from
publication in 6,500.

3) JUNE 4, 2000: Reading for people who don't want to traverse Fourteen
Hills in order to celebrate Fourteen Hills. Many of the same readers as
listed in (1) will appear at A Clean Well-Lighted Place for Books (601
Van Ness, 5 pm).

4) JUNE 27, 2000: Jan Richman, editor of the forthcoming Issue #3 of
6,500, reads at Blue Books/New College with the visiting Ray Gonzalez.
That'll probably start at 7:30 pm too, but it's only May 16th now, too
early to judge -- we'll check on the progress of global warming and get
back to you with an update in mid-June.

Dear friend of savepacifica,

No news this time, just an urgent request for funds for the Pacifica
freelancers' strike fund, which supports the production of the strikers'
weekly newscast, Free Speech Radio News.

After a geneous outpouring of support after the strike began January 31,
donations have tapered off, and there is now so little money in the fund
that the existence of Free Speech Radio News past the month of May is in
jeopardy.

Funding a quality newscast takes money: in addition to supporting striking
reporters, we have to pay for studio rental and production costs, tape and
CD duplication, satellite rental fees, overnight mailing fees,
long-distance phone bills, etc.

Please make your check out to Friends of Free Speech Radio, and mail it
to: "Freelancers' Strike Fund," c/o Friends of Free Speech Radio, 905
Parker St., Berkeley, CA 94710.

Better yet, become a Free Speech Radio News sustainer by sending a monthly
contribution of $10, $20 or more. If you'd like us to send you a reminder
notice each month, just let us know.

Thank you on behalf of 42 striking Pacifica freelance reporters.

        THE PICKLE JAR
 "The Pickle Jar" is a performance troupe made up of five students in the
New York University graduate Creative Writing Program. In addition to their
work as writers and teachers, The Pickle Jar develops performances based on
the poems of the Late, Great Ones.
This afternoon's performance, the first of many they have developed,
imagines a party of poets from across time taking place at Emily
Dickinson's house in Amherst, MA.
Each of the poets--Sappho, Sylvia Plath, Emily Dickinson, Ted Hughes, and
Rumi--speaks only in poems, lines, and fragments of their own poetry. This
slam won the Dead Poet's Slam contest at the Poetry Olympics at the
Brooklyn Brewery this past November.

Individual Biographies:
        Corie Herman is a performance poet from the New York City area; she
considers Sappho one of the most important "figures" in feminism as well as
poetry. That is why she has manifested her as a drinking, smoking,
leather-vinyl wearing sexy mamma.
        Amelia Wentworth built her own house out of slanted wood and called
it truth. She listens to the gospel of the crickets every night.
        Jason Schniederman is one of the most sought after porn stars in
the business. The son of migrant workers, he is a pathological liar.
        Jaymie ScottodiSantolo's Sylva Plath is electric, riveting and
simply sex. Come see her hair grow licks of fire, her mouth erupt in
poetry, herhand clench over Ted Hughes' balls...
        Kazim Ali is an activist, painter, and tantric totem. He imagines
Rumi as his (bare-chested, glitter-smeared, belly-dancing, smoldering)
ancestor. In previous lives he's been Eros, Garbo, and Ephraim of "The
Changing Light of Sandover" fame.
        Much More Poetry plus Open Reading & Food & Drink Galore!

        Does this mean there are to be VI other sessions in Long Beach next
week, and if so, can you list these also? I realize these -could_ have
taken place in previous yeArs, but at the same time, a conference that
lasts only an hour and a quarter sounds unlikely.


>3:30-4:50 a.m.


      These hours would suit me....I'm not sure if the custodians will want
to hang around to lock up afterwards.

Below is a new review from the Buffalo News of
Charles Bernstein's REPUBLICS OF REALITY.

Douglas Messerli, Sun & Moon Press

A strong focus on the language

By R.D. POHL
Special to The Buffalo News 5/7/00


"It's not my/ business to describe/ anything. The only/ report is the/
discharge of/ words called/ to account for their slurs," writes Charles
Bernstein in "Have Pen, Will Travel," one of the concluding poems in
"Republics of Reality: 1975-1995," his latest collection of work
published just last week by Sun and Moon Press.

Description of a perceived world "out there" has never been the
principal concern of Bernstein's poetry, which he prefers to call
"polyreferential" with respect to the way its language engages a range
of possible readings. Instead his focus has been on the particularity of
language itself, its sheer physicality and "animalady" (a Bernstein
coinage) as well as how it colors, shapes, and orders how we experience
and think about the world.

"Love of language," he writes in this volume's "Palukaville," "excludes
its reduction to a scientifically managed system of reference in which
all is expediency and truth is nowhere."

"Republics of Reality" consists of a compilation of eight of Bernstein's
previously published chapbooks or limited edition publications now long
out-of-print, plus a ninth section (called "Residual Rubbernecking")
which appears here for the first time in book form.

Despite weighing in at a hefty 374 pages, this volume represents only a
portion of Bernstein's total oeuvre during the period in question. Not
included are all the poems contained in his longer, better known
collections with larger publishers (particularly Sun and Moon Press)
including the volumes "The Sophist" (1987), "Rough Trades" (1991) and
"Dark City" (1994) upon which rest his current reputation as perhaps
this country's leading advocate for literary innovation and a
language-centered approach to poetics.

But for readers who know Bernstein principally as a writer-critic,
teacher and scholar (he is the David Gray Professor of Poetry and
Letters at the University at Buffalo and directs UB's Poetics Program),
this volume presents a fascinating overview of the first two decades of
his prolific career, particularly the early work which played such an
influential role in the evolution of so-called "language" poetry in
North America. (Bernstein co-founded and co-edited the magazine
L3DA3DN3DG3DU3DA3DG3DE with colleague Bruce Andrews from 1978 to
1981.)

>From the minimalist, serialist approach of "Sentences" in his first
collection "Parsing" (a remarkable poem that retains a certain vestigial
narrative thread: it's about sickness, insecurity, and fear masquerading
as boredom) to the more radical experiments with sense, syntax and
spelling in prose and mixed forms in the collections "Shade," "Poetic
Justice" and "The Occurrence of Tune," one can almost discern an
exploratory arc in Bernstein's work. If at first he appears to
whimsically deconstruct most of the familiar elements of poetic form, he
subsequently relocates the presence of language in a poem's most basic,
irreducible phonemes.

Several of the poems in "Poetic Justice" engage in a high playfulness
that suggests new ways of thinking about how a poem can be organized.
"Electric" gets startling comic effects out of punning, clever wordplay
and improvised upper and lower case shifting: the typographical
equivalent of a malfunctioning Caps Lock key on a typewriter. "Azoot D'
Puund" is written in an invented language that looks like a hybrid of
Chaucerian English (is the reference to Ezra Pound?) and Afrikaans.

One of more notable surprises of reading through this volume, however,
is the degree to which Bernstein's writing since mid-1980s has
gravitated towards recognizably lyrical forms. At least in the work
represented here (the collections including "Resistance" (1983), "The
Absent Father in "Dumbo' " (1990) and "Residual Rubbernecking") he has
consistently introduced familiar rhythms and even occasional rhyme
schemes into his increasingly musical work.

This is not to suggest that his work is any less subversive, however,
since the shift seems designed at least in part for comic and satirical
purposes. Nor has his syntax become any more specifically referential.
Reading or listening to one of Bernstein's poems still reminds one of
Ludwig Wittgenstein's famous remark about language occasionally "going
out on holiday": the rules of grammar and reference seem a bit relaxed,
but everyone's having a ball.

Still, when he begins a poem like "Bulge" ("The reward for/ love is not/
love, any more/ than the reward/ for disobedience/ is grace. What/
chains these/ conditions severs/ semblance of/ a hand, two/ fists, in
pre-emptive/ embrace with/ collusion") even if the sense of the poem is
complex, disjunctive, and replete with possible meanings, its rhythm and
form evoke lyrical feeling.

Contrast this to a decidedly anti-lyrical excerpt from "The Taste is
What Counts" from Bernstein's "Poetic Justice" (1979): "More than I
pretend, choppiness, its mass, a revolt against it. Complication beyond
the box they require pervades like the world it makes. The purposiveness
of the sensations a clear mirror. Glimpse immediately flashing formed
with a passing knowledge that becomes your whole life reflected. Still
empty the waves turning, movement to become an opacity as lap or
imprint." In "Autonomy is Jeopardy," Bernstein, who does not typically
write for a specific voice (and indeed rejects the idea of constructing
an "authentic" narrative voice in principle) creates an alter ego whose
fears correspond to those of the reader, and quite possibly to those of
the poet himself. "Poetry scares me," he writes, "I/ mean its virtual
(or ventriloquized)/ anonymity no protection, no/ bulwark to accompany
its pervasive/ purposivelessness, it accretive/ acceleration into what
may or / may not swell. Eyes demand/ counting, the nowhere seen
everywhere/ behaved voicelessness everyone is clawing/ to get a piece
of. Shudder/ all you want it won't/ make it come any faster/ last any
longer."

...announcing:


T H E   P O E T R Y   O F   P E T E R   R I L E Y

a special issue of _The Gig_ (#4/5; Nov. 99/Mar. 00)


232pp, perfectbound: inside are an interview with the poet; poetry
(including Riley's "Llyn in the Rain, September 1998," a new work mixing
prose and verse); thirteen essays on Riley's work; and a bibliography.

Contributors: Tony Baker, Sarah Clair, Lorand Gaspar, John Hall, Peter
Hughes, James Keery, Peter Larkin, Tony Lopez, Tom Lowenstein, Peter
Middleton, Mark Morrisson, Simon Perril, Peter Robinson, Keston Sutherland,
Keith Tuma and Nigel Wheale.

*

Peter Riley, born in 1940, is the author of over two dozen books of poetry,
including _Lines on the Liver_, _Tracks and Mineshafts_, _Distant Points_
and _Snow Has Settled [....] Bury Me Here_.  His work has appeared in the
anthologies _A Various Art_ and _Conductors of Chaos_, and his selected
poems, _The Gravel Paths_, will appear from Carcanet.  Riley's work is
grounded on a deep knowledge both of the modernist poetries of the present
and of the literatures of past centuries, and it reflects the author's
knowledge of other languages, his travels, and his interests in archaeology,
geology and music.  Its voice often meditative but always urgent, Riley's
poetry is both uncategorizable and of the highest distinction.

From Peter Riley's _Author_:


IN MANUS TUAS

            for John Sheppard


Gendering touch that gathers
and cups like a boat on the
rotting sea because I tendered

All I am to your safety.  Then we are eye
to eye, heart to purpose, bent
forward in the western wind

That blows over the hard and
blanched ground towards an idea
of work as shelter.

The children raised there will blow
this distance to anthills, and hand
themselves to aerials

And hunt themselves to equity
in an undertree light loud with one
mutual cry--of succession

Dying to a rich suture of the future.
Deep then in the oily mulch a
smouldering hope, a patient ear

To another's woe and a door behind the snow.
How it seals the film of spring,
where we ride forth in company.

channelings, murmurs


subterranean domains of the imaginary -
word islandings of interrelations apparently crossing indo-european
roots.
poetry operates, not through the surface of words, but through their
islandings.
each of the lines below represent a close-knit family of usages.
their indo-european origins tend to wander from the islands.
the measure of all islands is the measure of culture.
poetry is motivated by the measure of culture and swimmings.
other languages are similar - look at the wildly disparate kanji for
romaji words of similar meanings and pronunciations.
we can call all of these satellite sememes.
i say: language, poetry, has no center, nothing beyond the sememes and
their interrelated streamings.
there are many more than the below; some of the examples may seem far-
fetched; one has to look beneath the surface oneself.

wiggle jiggle giggle waggle jaggle gaggle haggle (see below also)
skitter scatter stutter spatter sputter
flitter flutter pitter-patter mutter
bog sog fog nog quagmire slog
bump dump lump sump mump hump jump rump
ill spill kill pill
nub bub lob sub grub hub / mud dud flood cud
bangle jangle slang bang rang clang
bick(er) flick lick / kick / stick pick dick (around)
swagger haggle jagged ragged wagged fragged
worn torn forlorn mourn morn shorn fear
squash swish swash awash quash smash splash dash flash flush
root rote mood soot foot hut fruit
rough stuff gruff tough snuff
edge ledge nudge judge ridge fledg(ling)
stew rue mew mewl
carry tarry hurry dally (?) lull (?) rally sally tally
swim sweat swell(ing) swine swoon
mount fount bount(iful) haunt taunt (?) pounce (?)
little whittle spittle fiddle (around) middle riddle
harken earth art hearth forth (go) froth murk mark (?)

in some cases, suffixes suffice for the determination; in others, how-
ever, the means are literally subterranean. these associative word com-
plexes point to more than history or origin; they resonate across issues
of being and its metaphysics.

Hi Everyone,

In about two weeks I'm going to officially publish the next Readme (#3),
which is still under construction, but before I do that, I wanted to put out
a last call for anyone who maintains a literary website: I've got about a
dozen entries so far (plus interviews with Alysia Abbott, who runs
steveabbott.com, and Briank Kim Stefans, who does arras online), but would
love to include more, if possible. If you maintain a site, and want to write
up something about your experience (or theories, or goals, etc.), please get
in contact with me. If you know someone who maintains a site who might be
interested, please forward this message along. Though this is all very much
still in progress, you can take a look, if need be:

Subject: Call for Peltier's Parole: Press Conference

Friends,

Below is a press advisory for a Washington DC press conference that will be
held this Wednesday, May 17th to call for Leonard Peltier's release through
parole.  The press conference will occur just hours before the Congressional
Human Rights Caucus hold a briefing on the Peltier case.  Please forward
this information to your local media sources.  Thank you.

In solidarity,
the LPDC


Press Conference to Call for Leonard Peltier's Parole
12 May 14:30
Press Conference to Call for Leonard Peltier's Parole

Contact: Pat Davis of Leonard Peltier Justice Coalition,
202-518-7781

News Advisory:

Nobel Peace Laureate Rigoberta Menchu will join acclaimed
author Peter Matthiessen, Amnesty International representatives
and Ernie Stevens of the National Congress of American Indians
to press the United States government to grant parole and/or
clemency in the case of Leonard Peltier.

They will speak at a press conference scheduled for 10 a.m.
Wednesday, May 17, at the Washington, D.C. offices of
Amnesty International, 600 Pennsylvania, SE Washington D.C.
Peltier is a Native American leader who has been
incarcerated in the United States for 24 years, following
his highly controversial conviction for the murder of
two FBI agents. Despite disturbing evidence of FBI
misconduct in the case, including the coercion of witnesses,
the intentional use of false evidence and the concealment
of a key ballistics test reflecting his innocence, Peltier
has been denied a new trial and is long overdue for
parole. He has been recognized by numerous human rights
organizations, religious leaders and Nobel laureates as
one of the United States' few political prisoners.
Domestic and international pressure is mounting for his
immediate and unconditional release.

The press conference will be followed by a congressional
briefing from 2-4 p.m., May 17, Rayburn House Office Building,
Room 2358, sponsored by the offices of U.S. Rep. John Porter
(R-Ill.), co-chairperson of the Congressional Human Rights
Caucus. The witnesses will include survivors of the Pine
Ridge Reservation "Reign of Terror," which took place
from 1973-1976. During this period 64 Native American
members and supporters of the American Indian Movement,
or AIM, were murdered on the reservation. Despite a
massive FBI presence at the time, there was no adequate
investigation and no charges were ever brought for these
killings. Menchu and Native American leaders from the United
States will also speak on the case.

POETRY CENTER 2000
The Poetry Center & American Poetry Archives
presents

a reading & celebration of Robin Blaser's 75th birthday
ROBIN BLASER
Thursday May 18, 7:30 pm, $5
Special Location
@ ODC Theater (17th & Shotwell)
San Francisco

** Call the Theater for reservations: 415-863-9834 **

". . . the neighbors have a wooden robin--very still
'til the wind hits--wooden, whining wings--
events--a weather vane--weathecock of
the way the wind flows--fane or fana
of thought--vane of a congress of such
birds--vaned attempt--to see directions--
for the love of destination--new fountain
the smoke of art . . ."

We're closing our season with an evening that should not be missed by
anyone who cares about poetry.  *  ROBIN BLASER's readings in San Francisco
are legendary.   *  With his great friends Robert Duncan and Jack Spicer,
as a young man Mr. Blaser was at the heart of both the Berkeley and the San
=46rancisco Renaissances of the 1940s and '50s.  *  Since the mid-60s he's
made his home in Vancouver, British Columbia.  *  His collected poems, The
Holy Forest, is a primary text of our poetic era, a mystery work that
enacts the randon=E9e, a quest both romantic and "after the modern" that
wanders off at the same time in search of the real and the deeply
imaginary.  *  He will be returning to town following the world premier by
the Berlin Staatsopfer under conductor Daniel Barenboim of Sir Harrison
Birtwistle's newest opera, The Last Supper--with libretto by Robin Blaser.

*  Music, refreshments, and festivities will follow, so stay for the party. =
 *


THE ODC THEATER
is located at 3153 17th Street at Shotwell in the Mission District
cheap, secure parking in the lot across 17th;

Submissions are now open for the autumn issue of Riding the Meridian.
The issue will not have a theme, per se, but we do plan to explore the
intersection between art and literature on the Web, and the precedents
for such.  Our roundtable discussion will explore the opportunities and
challenges our new medium faces, while the 'male version' of our
Progressive Dinner Party, "Jumping at the Diner" will present a survey
of web specific hypertexts and hypermedia by men working in English.

Original, previously unpublished work is being sought in several categories:

1.  Hypertext and Hypermedia

2.  Digital art works

3.  Kinetic and Concrete poetry

4.  Classic text work

To submit hypertext, hypermedia, digital art, kinetic or concrete
poetry, please send a url where the work can be viewed on the web with a
brief description of the work and a short bio.

To submit text poetry, please send up to four previously unpublished
works in the body of an email message with a short bio.

In addition, any articles on technical concerns writers and artists face
when creating work for the Web would be appropriate for this issue.
Please send a brief query letter if you wish to write on any technical subjects.

Address all submissions/queries to editor, Jennifer Ley,
jley@heelstone.com and include the words "Meridian Submission" in the
subject line.

Listmates, Let me urge you to read and act upon what is appended to this post.

Let me also take the opportunity to footnote the quatrain I posted several
days since. When I headed it "Berkeley Geek Theater" and wrote

  I met death the other day :
  He wore a face like Castlereagh.
  I met Death the other night :
  Ladies and gentlemen, Madeleine Albright ,


I was referring to grad ceremonies that had taken place at UC Bkly's Greek
Theater, where a convocation was addressed by M.Albright, who publicly
stated recently that if the sanctions against Iraq resulted (as the U.N.
says they do) in the death of 5,000 Iraqi children, the sanctions were
worth these deaths. About that number gave M.A. a standing ovation.

To their credit, protesters kept up a barrage of "Shame!" throughout, for
which they were dragged off by State Dept police. Living in the KPFA radio
range, I forget that not everyone has access to such information--and
beyond doubt, M.Albright is among those who look forward to the day when
KPFA can broadcast no more.
  I suppose, given the efficency of censorship-by-corporate-media in the
USA, more of you are aware that the first couplet of my quatrain is by
Shelley, than of Albright's callous admission and dismissal of her
genocides. Except there is still the Internet.....

that should have read 500,000 Iraqi children; the 5,000 refers only to the
audience that gave M Albright a standing ovation. Apologies. David

1. Important Development in Mumia=92s Legal Case
2. Attack on Clark Kissinger and Frances Goldin

1. Important Development in Mumia=92s Legal Case
In response to a request by Mumia=92s legal team, Judge Yohn has granted
permission for the defense to file a supplemental brief on the issues
raised by the recent Supreme Court decisions on the Effective Death
Penalty Act (the two Williams v. Taylor cases). This is good news.
The defense team has until June 2 to file this brief, which cannot
exceed 15 pages. The prosecution has until June 23 to reply. It means
that the first hearing in Mumia=92s habeas petition before Judge Yohn will
be not be until after June 23.=20
(posted May 17, 2000, by Clark Kissinger)

2. Attack on Clark Kissinger and Frances Goldin
Below is a letter from attorney Michael Tarif Warren concerning an
outrageous attack on two people who have been at the center of the
movement to stop the execution of Mumia: Clark Kissinger of Refuse &
Resist! and Frances Goldin, Mumia=92s literary agent.=20

Dear friends,

In the last few weeks, a very serious attempt by the government to
stifle the movement for justice for Mumia Abu-Jamal has unfolded. This
is a tribute to our effectiveness, but it also demands that we
vigorously respond.

I am asking you to join with me in signing the attached statement which
will be published and forwarded to the appropriate federal court judge.
Please send permission to attach your name to me at 580 Washington Ave.,
Brooklyn, NY 11238, or phone or fax to the numbers above.

Those who wish to contribute to the cost of the appeal may also sent a
check made out to Frances Goldin, at 305 E. 11th St., #26, New York, NY
10003.

Let=92s keep the voices defending our political prisoners on line and
fighting.

Sincerely,
Michael Tarif Warren

WE PROTEST

We are writing to protest a serious attempt by the federal government to
cripple the work of some of the staunchest supporters of Mumia
Abu-Jamal. Clark Kissinger, organizer of the national leadership
conferences for Mumia, Frances Goldin, Mumia=92s literary agent, and
several others have been sentenced by a federal magistrate to a fine and
one year supervised probation.

Ms. Goldin and Mr. Kissinger are forbidden to associate with felons
(i.e. Mumia) and cannot leave their federal court district in New York
City without the permission of a probation officer for one year. In
addition, they are required to be employed at a regular job (i.e. no
full-time volunteer work for Mumia), they have to surrender their
passports, submit to visits to their homes and offices by probations
officers, list all persons they are in contact with who have been
convicted of a crime, and turn in detailed financial records every month
on where their money comes from and how they spend it.

These Orwellian restrictions were imposed as the result of a peaceful
protest and civil disobedience action last year at the Liberty Bell in
Philadelphia. Ninety-six people were issued summonses by Park Rangers
for "failing to obey a lawful order." This infraction is not even a
misdemeanor. It is classified as a "petty offense" and is equivalent to
a traffic ticket. Yet everyone who refused to return the summons
pleading guilty and paying the fixed fine =97 and who had the temerity to
ask for a trial =97 was given one-year supervised probation in addition to
the fine.

In addition, Mr. Kissinger=92s wife has been served with a subpoena to
produce all her financial records for the last ten years and to testify
before a federal grand jury. This is a giant fishing expedition by
federal agents, that further exposes the role of the federal government
in attempting to execute Mumia and silence the movement in his defense.

There are two principles worth fighting for here. The first is the right
to have a trial. Mr. Kissinger, Ms. Goldin, and the others were given
the one-year probation as punishment for asking for a trial. The second
is that the government has no right to restrict key organizers and pry
into their private associations and finances.

These judicial actions are an outrage and are clearly aimed at "shutting
down" anyone who works effectively for Mumia. The progressive forces in
this country cannot surrender the right to a trial, nor can we tolerate
the attempt of the government to "ground" those working for Mumia.

The imposition of these judicial restrictions and subpoenas on leading
activists and their families serves no purpose other than to chill the
first amendment rights of those who have been most effective in bringing
Mumia=92s case before the public. We demand that they be stayed at once,
and overturned by the appeals court.

The complete program for the 2000 ALA conference is
available on the Web at:

http://humanities.byu.edu/ALA/2000_Program.htm

And, of course, the panel on which I am appearing is
scheduled for 3:30 to 4:50 PM (I did a copy and paste off
the program -- it was their error, I swear).

There doesn't appear to be a great deal of presentations
on the poetry side of things, but there are other
intriguing panels on such topics as "proletarian
literature" and "black masculinities." Have a look for
yourself.

That's better. "Depiction," as I understand it, involves painting (and to a
certain extent, vice versa); it is the procedure in pictorial art analogous
to that of description in writing. Neither depiction nor description have
anything necessarily to do with transparency, though obviously you can try
to make it "so real you could reach out and touch" the thing thus
represented. The "de-" in both cases bears the connotation of either "off"
or "of," or then again, "from." I prefer "off" (writing "off" something
perceived or imagined, as a point of departure, a motif) or "from" ("I
painted --  or wrote? -- this from life"). Thus, to prefer description over
depiction seems a piece of nonsense -- unless of course you just don't like
painting.

Urged on this a.m. by Anselm Hollo's adroit, ever-alert, corrective spirit.

Amen.

If I listened to their broadcasts (I don't, tho that
may change) I'd support them by buying whatever they
may advertise during their broadcast, assuming it had
any value to me. The advertisers would then pay the
company, the company would then pay the employees. Any
of the individuals engaged in these transactions are
free to walk away from them at any time.
What does this have to do with poetry? Glad you
enquired.
Do I get money or credit for poems I don't write, no
matter how noble the reason for not writing them?
Not bloody likely.
Maybe I'll go on strike as a union of one and wait for
everyone on this list to send me big fat cheques!
Don't worry, I'll even give you reminders every day to
send me those blank cheques, because I know you have
many things to think about, and these things can slip
your mind.

Send yr money (I'll take cash, cheque or money order)

I'll be sitting by my mailbox waiting for the

huge protest marches and Gene
Hackman played me in the Holly-

Did this give anyone else the creeps?  I know Verse editors are on list, but
"upload and we''ll charge your credit card the entry fee"?

What are audio rights? "Audio production"?  Is someone besides me going to read
my work into RealAudio? That's a prize?  How much are they paying authors of
books for "digital rights"?  Their existing texts are largely in the public
domain -- what should anyone pay them $5.00 for Spinoza's _Ethics_ when they can
get it any number of places for free?

Should I start deeply encoding my name into all of my poems (as everyone should
do with corporate work)?

        In spite of  its great vitality and richness, Australian poetry remains
little known in the United States =96 a fact especially deplorable since a
close look at the current Australian poetry scene may reveal a healthier
model than either our own American or the British. While the
English-language poetries of the Northern Hemisphere are largely divided
into isolated camps and aesthetics, all rife with our cherished "politics
of poetic form," the Australians are having fun. There are no poetry camps
down under and no aesthetic antagonisms. A lot of very different things are
going on, but Australian poetry as a whole exhibits a harmonious,
pluralistic oneness: the issue of "correct form" is dead and a formal
anarchy rules.=20
        John Kinsella's work is imbued with precisely the kind of holistic energy
that such a neurosis-free "cultural politics" tends to release. A selected,
Poems 1980-1994 reveals a stylistic diversity that unabashedly spans the
presumable extremes of "lyricism" and "avantgarde," "formalism" and
"experimentalism," or, in Les Murray's more authentic phrase, between the
Athenian and the Boeotian poles of the Autralian poetic imagination.
        Kinsella exemplifies the modern process whereby poetics are naturally
evolving into and fusing with metapoetics. The emphasis is not so much on
form as on the metapoetic statement. The mechanism that conveys the
statement is the interplay between the idiosyncratic, personal vision, and
the careful concealment of the lyric I, the avoidance of the personal or
emotional statement. This discontinuity, the obstruction of Romantic
"organic form," is one of the salient features of Kinsella's aesthetic. A
personal vision is presented quasi-objectively, as if from outside =96 a
quality that might give it the firmness of true myth, were it not for the
explosive derailments of traditional discourse in the more experimental
sections of Kinsella's work. These, however, are accomplished without the
loss of vividness or coherence:

                Swift overload catapulting
                recrimination
                the largess culminating
                cinema papers boys-own-annual-ing
                from post office to mailbox
                and bicycle-clip braces
                on the maligned bull-terrier's
                teeth: an island of green
                reticulated sucked into the soft pink
                of the suburb...

        The evanescence of  the lyric self is echoed by the features of that
perpetual doppelganger of the mind, the landscape, which happens to be
predominantly the harsh, rural and flat landscape of Western Australia,
filled with friable and fluid substances (water, smoke, sand, dust, salt).
Its reconceptualized map stretches throughout Kinsella's writing,
narrative-representational and experimental alike; it links his diverse
aesthetics, reconciling transparence and opaqueness, the iconic view and a
kaleidoscope of visions. Some of the most moving parts of the book are
about wild and domestic animals, and a few passages may go a long way
toward turning the reader into a vegetarian.
        A part of Kinsella's apparent intention is to destabilize the reading
process, to yank firm ground from under it. The erudite poet is well tuned
in to current Anglo- and  Francophone literary theory. Whether or not one
agrees with the poststructuralist, skeptical schools of thought, it is
interesting to observe their feedback as practicing poets use them in
constructing their own aesthetics. Kinsella's Genre, dedicated to Jaques
Derrida, may be seen as an aesthetic validation of deconstruction. It is in
a genre beyond genres: not a forest of symbols, nor even of floating
signifiers, but a glowing fusion of discourses, prosaic and poetic,
literary and critical, authored and "found," comprising a large but finite
number of plots and ideas, all wedged and twisted into a labyrinthine
structure, chopped up and rejoined by way of fragmentation and montage, all
interrupted and resuming in cycles, but retaining an intelligible pace
throughout the volume, some reaching a moment of closure and some not. The
graphic presentation is important: the whole work consists of lines
identical length, about two thirds of the page width, and without a single
line or paragraph break =96 an almost perfect rectangular solid of text.
Poems, narratives, letters, cover letters, erotic scenes, critical analyses
are all mixed up here, stripped of any stable context and yet each endowed
with a phenomenal continuity. Subjects range from Western cultural
hermeneutics to South Asian politics, from a poacher hunt the last
Tasmanian tiger to (fictional) psychedelic experiences, from animals to
Language Poetry, from art to science to social issues. The overall effect,
paradoxically, is not an impassable aporia, but effervescent and memorable
discourse.
        Visitants, his latest volume of poems, is vintage Kinsella, but with some
new features, one of which is a somewhat greater lushness of verse and
perception, and often a greater thematic density within a single poem.
Along with ideas of otherness and alienness (the "visitants" are
quintessential "aliens"), the book explores various divisions within
humanity: class, sex, age, authority, party, property, belief, ethics, etc.
One of the central concerns is superstition and faith in the occult =96 a
phenomenon that is not subjected to any overt criticism but presented in
Kinsella's "quasi-objective" style, like emanations of surreal possible
worlds admitted into the radically contingent quiddity of existence.
        While in much of Kinsella's writing there appears to be an impulse toward
unsettling the habitual norms of discourse, his experimentalism is
refreshingly synthetic and constructive, rather than obscurantist or
dissociative. It is a rebellion against the fixed possibilities of reading
which nevertheless remains eminently readable. Kinsella's poetic intellect
may be a school unto itself, but is little concerned with the conventional
schools and camps of poetry, simply because it has far better things to do.

Anomalous Parlance 5: Bad Infinity by Susan Clark, with a talk: "as lit x"
Sunday May 28th 2pm
Kootenay School of Writing
201 - 505 Hamilton Street
Vancouver BC
$5/$3

Susan Clark reads from her Levinasian long poem Bad Infinity and delivers a
talk "as lit x".

Clark's previous books include Believing in the World: a reference work
(Tsunami 1989) and the manuscripts Suck Glow, Theatre of the New World of
the Time, and Mutability Lyrics.  "hyster.pom" appears in West Coast Line 24
(1997-1998); an excerpt from "The Verge" in Raddle Moon 17 (1998); and
"Gether" in The Gig 3 (1999).  She edits the journal Raddle Moon.

A series of Clark's hand-made books -- Excess Flesh, Three Tea Books, "she
spat apolitically / a primitive rule", Double Hula Book for ladies, "his
only assent was his function", and Mélancholie -- will also be on display.

...

Every capitalization dials
where we are up

A name plaque round the memorial side
where the area "gently but regularly rises to the middle"

I was so sure it meant that I
even though even
it mistook its instructions in time

Welcome.

(from "Tied to a Post -- essay in abstraction" -- from Bad Infinity)


Because inquiry as Lack addressing Fullness hopelessly from its sheer
proscenium just highlights the drool -- the big sticky on stage, flailing,
lit, forgotten and forgetting [i.e. perfect] -- the encyclopaedia is
secretly modelled -- like language -- on the religio-romantic concept of
Devotion which makes it all better by proposing then necessitating an
infinitely postponed salvation to clean up the mess.

(from "Gether" -- from "the Agglomerative" -- a classifying section of Bad
Infinity)

BAD INFINITY is the fifth of six events in the Anomalous Parlance series at
KSW, curated by Aaron Vidaver.  Upcoming participants in the series include
Christine Stewart (June 25).

"If I listened to their broadcasts (I don't, tho that
may change) I'd support them by buying whatever they
may advertise during their broadcast, assuming it had
any value to me. The advertisers would then pay the
company, the company would then pay the employees. Any
of the individuals engaged in these transactions are
free to walk away from them at any time.
What does this have to do with poetry? Glad you enquired."

KPFA is a community based radio station, which means that there are NO
advertisements, not even of the non-advert kind familiar to all from PBS,
NPR and CBC. In fact, it was KPFA and the Pacifica Radio Network that first
thought up the idea of listener sponsorship.

I personally got sucked into listening on the Xmas of my 12th year when my
mom gave me a transistor radio that had FM on it (we're talkin' '58 here)
and literally heard Dylan Thomas reading A Child's Christmas in Wales that
day while bowling. I'd already missed the early shows by Jack Spicer, but I
certainly heard David Gitin's great series with tapes of Olson and the like,
and later Clark Coolidge's similar series.

Many of the rules as to what can (and cannot) be heard over the radio and
when derive from the work of KPFA, specifically from a court case that
started because of the broadcast of Allen Ginsberg reading Howl.

In the American Tree, originally hosted by Kit Robinson & Erica Hunt, was a
radio program before it was a book.

And Jack Foley has done a lot of good stuff in more recent years.

So this has indeed everything to do with poetry,

PS, you could make the same case for comtemporary music, esp. with the great
folk music shows (that's what Spicer had, by the way), plus the work of
Charles Amirkhanian, Henry Kaiser, Opal Nations, Chris Strachwitz, Charles
Shere et al.

Or news coverage, or or or.....

Filliou:  poet, mail artist: "the Eternal Network" . . . performance
artist--


Press Release from 871 Fine Arts:

"Robert Filliou: Poet and Artist (1926 - 1987)

871 Fine Arts is pleased to present an exhibition of the French
Fluxus artist, Robert Filliou.

A charter member of Fluxus, Filliou was born in 1926.  He
emigrated to the United States in 1946 where he attended UCLA.
After graduating with a masters degree in economics in 1951, he
became an American citizen.

The concept of play is at the core of Filliou's work.  Ephemeral
in nature, mired in word play, his pieces are almost always
concerned with the problem of creativity itself and with new ways
to foster it.  He participated in many "street events" and
happenings after he returned to Paris in 1959.  Deeply affected
by the social and political upheavals of the late 1960s, his
artistic work followed the concepts of creative and intellectual
play laid out by the intellectuals in the revolutionary
environment of  Paris in the 1960s and '70s.  Indeed, the idea of
play became a symbol of revolutionary protest.

One of his more interesting pieces, "The Hand Show" clearly
demonstrates Filliou's concerns.  It is a series of  photographs
of artists' hands.  It addresses the unlimited number of
possibilities that lie within the hands of artists.  for Filliou,
these possibilities are endless and inherently valuable for
society.

Another piece on view in this exhibition is "The, A Novel Robert
Filliou" 1976, a shallow cardboard box cut out in one corner to
accommodate a smaller box, with the title scrawled on each.

For Filliou, art was serious play and he dedicated his life to
reconsidering what the world would be like if people were allowed
to play, to dream and to create.

This exhibition will be on view from April 6th to July 8th."

I suggest Writing and Difference, Of Grammatology, Disseminations for the
answers to all  of your questions.  The arguments, pretty damn logical, are
there.  As for Western Metaphysics, Derrida's point is no more complicated
than this:  philosophy in the west has always proceeded from some version
of absolute ground, i.e., a priori structure, as does all logical argument.
It is
this refusal to interrogate the center/first principle (obvious or concealed,
as in
the case of Wittgenstein, both early and late) that raises suspicion.
Derrida's
logic is to use the machinery of logic, but to push it as far as it will go
(not
stopping at some provisional source).  He has always admitted that we are
trapped within the metaphysics of language and cannot write outside of those
borders.  All I'm asking is, if D can deconstruct all "sources" (and he can
and
does as many as are possible in a limited lifetime), then anyone who opposes
him better mount an argument that demonstrates that these sources/first
principles
(or at least one of them) are self identical.  Because that's what it will
take
to debunk Derrida.  Really, D is an ontological atheist in opposition to the
philosophers of faith (a priori believers).  It is always the responsibility
of those
who propose the existence of god/source/center/self-identical first principle
to prove their case.  For example, if D can show that the self identical
cogito
is not, in fact, self identical, then it's up to Descartes to prove
otherwise.  Of
course language participates in the metaphysical tradition.  The ground for
meaning, and therefore meaning itself in any absolute sense, is forever
deferred.
But language encourages us to accept what is provisional as absolute in order
to accept some sense of determinacy without which we could hardly get along.

This is apropos of "description" in an expanded sense, perchance.

Once, in the environs of Wheeler Hall in the mid 80s, I was talking to
Robert Pinksy about this-and-that poetics, and I was ranting in hyperbolic
style about Bob Dylan being a kind of Blake for our time, refiguring
"Jesus the Imagination" in a time of imperial blight and so on.
Pinsky looked at me wryly, a bit baffled, and said, "Dylan is somebody I
never got into.  I never really thought of him as a poet."  I was amazed
by this comment, and begin to wonder (as I often do) if I knew what poetry
is anymore.  But I never lost my amazement towards B Dylan, and his latest
Nietzschean attack on his own deepest belief structures and pieties in
"Time Out of Mind" and "Things Have Changed" from "Wonderboys" soundtrack
only confirms the scope, depth, and generic visionary quality of his work.

The only comment I ever read that comes close to describing the way Dylan
writes and composes. "teaches" (lord knows he is hyper-diadactic), and
describes via a liberated notion of digression, metaphoric leaping, and
tonal/imagistic/linguistic free association, can be found in Deleuze, who
wrote:

"As a teacher I should like to be able to give a course as Dylan organizes
a song, as astonishing producer rather than author.  And that it should
begin as he does, suddenly, with his clown's mask, with a technique of
contriving, and yet improvising each detail.  The opposite of a
plagiarist, but also the opposite of a master or a model. A very lengthy
preparation, yet no method, nor rules, nor recipes."

Dylan is not a workshop poet, his voice is rough and meandering, he never
would become poet laureate or model of mastery, but it seems to me that
what he writes and sings is poetry at the core of the Pax Americana and

mouth harp.

I am not sure I am describing "description"here, but this does have
something to do with poetic syntax as resistance to domination.

        I agree on the creepy-ness of this. Whoever is in charge of this I
hope a special place in hell opens its gates for you. A ten dollar reading
fee uploaded from a credit card??? I am warry of most contests but this
seems a special style scam designed for the back pages of P&W or Railyard
Poet. Who are you and why have you come??? What does a $3000 poem look like?
Oh no matter because it will not be my poem anymore since I give you the
rights to it even if I do not win. My unpolished response to
PublishingOnline.com resolves around a violent act occuring in the normal
course of love making.

Small Press Traffic Reading
Friday, May 26, 2000, 7:30 p.m.
Kit Robinson
Lisa Samuels

Kit Robinson has recently done readings in Detroit, Buffalo, Philadelphia,
New York and England, but there's nothing like Small Press Traffic to bring
out the best in this uniquely American poet.  His latest book, Cloud Eight
(collaborations with Alan Bernheimer), is new from Sound & Language. Others
include Democracy Boulevard, Balance Sheet and Ice Cubes (all from Roof
Books), and titles from such noted small presses as Zasterle, The Figures,
Potes & Poets, Chax Press, Whale Cloth and Tuumba.  His translation from
the Russian of Ilya Kutik's Ode on Visiting the Belosaraisk Spit on the Sea
of Azov is available from Alef Books.  If there were some secret plot to
make a DNA sample of William Carlos Williams, and re-animate the kindly
doctor of Paterson, NJ, into a computer-based, Language-oriented,
simulacrum of a great poet, Kit Robinson would step out, tall and lanky,
from the Petri dish of our fondest hopes.

Lisa Samuels has published two poetry books, LETTERS (Meow Press, 1996) and
The Seven Voices (O Books, 1998).  She earned her Ph.D. from the University
of Virginia in 1997, publishes work on twentieth-century poetry and
poetics, and teaches creative writing and literature at Eastern Michigan
University.  She guest edited an issue of Modern Language Studies (1997, on
"Poetry and the Problem of Beauty") and edited (with an introduction) a
reprint of Laura Riding's Anarchism Is Not Enough, forthcoming from
University of California Press.  Like Laura Riding, Lisa Samuels is smart
as the devil and knows more about the enticements and enhancements of
reception theory than any mortal should.  Through a compostial alchemy, her
writing transforms the basic parts of speech and the parts of the body into
a pronomial paradise.  We're all implicated in the Samuels inquisition.

   How does or can Derrida prove that language exists? What Austin requires
of other metaphysicians also applies to Derrida? Why should Derrida get an
exemption from the necessity of "proof" of basic faith -in his case,
language? Once this privileged exemption is not granted, Derrida becomes like
every other metaphysical thinker and must be treated as such -critically.

   Derrida's assertions about the primacy of language are a priori
assertions, which the reader may or may not chose to accept. They are not
subject to disproof because they were never proven. The most radical
criticism of them is refusing to accept them, refusing to enter and share the
world view they imply, they invite. By this act completely new vistas open
before us.

something mute, suffocated discord, collapsed lungs and bridges   if not
that something else   something unutterable   living on the tip of the
blade   beneath, everything sliding upon the earth   plastics and
microchips   walking out in the street it occurs, just a small stone will
end my world   my body's impossible keeping   to reach anything one has
to use the whip   this switch moves something completely out of sight
the more one learns, the smaller the gains, the less the future   like
great teeth, a future being   that also passes   sooner or later, viruses,
claws, cracked gourds, clouds and never any sun   the comet, the comet,
the plague, the plague   easements   one has to be blind to things, to
being   being's muteness   at night, i try to sleep, i think, asteroid,

Filmophobe


Personne n'est parfait.

Who is an intellectual in this culture? Who speaks for whom? What is the
role of theory? What does it mean to be engaged? What does it mean to
destroy?

Bougie

Who is excluded by what means? Who owns the words I speak? What does it
mean to be locked out? What does it mean to starve? What does it mean to
dream of dying?

Vedette invitee

What do we do to crash your language? What does it mean to steal your
words? How can we shut you up and force you to listen? Why do you think
you have any answers at all? Beyond your cash, why do you think you
have the right to exist? Why do you think you even know the questions?

Le regard

How can we stop your look at the surface of the skin? How can we make
ourselves invisible? How can we violate your robbed speech? How can we
destroy so that we may speak?

Silence, on tourne!

Don't tell me when to speak. Your academy is alive and well. It will die
only with destruction. You will hear only when you are destroyed, when the
blood screams in your ears.

Ecran divise

There is no split screen; there are only bodies, tied, held in bondage;
there are only holes and ears held open by force; there is only emptiness
and death waiting in the wings.

Deux ou trois choses que je sais de

You talk as if we were stupid. You talk in our absence, fill our bodies
with words as if you were the revolution. You stifle any revolution, flay
our bodies in revolt, wear our skins. You are only good in our disguise.

Film-catastrophe

This film is a catastrophe. The extras remain outside. You brush the hair
out of each other's eyes. You have eyes only for each other. You fuck
power, not bodies. You believe in truth on the bodies of others.

Film de route ou d'errance

You travel safely from assignation to assignation. You pride yourself in
your set speech, your appearance. You ignore the road-kill. We place wires
across the road, you will catch us in your headlights, you will be
devoured.

Sequence

You will continue forever. The wires are a trick in the emulsion. They
catch nothing. You continue to speak; in our worst dreams, we do not dream
of your destruction. That is our calling: to applaud you. In our worst
dreams.

Fin d'un enchantement, le retour a la realite

You are broadband, you are almost real. The film has come to a close; the
theater has burned, there are no replacement parts. At the table, destroy,
she said; no one listened; someone disconnected.

                         SAHARA DATE

    Cincinnati, June 2000   /   Ralph La Charity

                   a poetics & music cycle
                      in three movements


        1st Movement / Elegies & Street Songs :

                  "Down To See in Shifts"

  SaS Chant / Crosstown Clipper / Jesse's Bell /
  Attle Chee Attle / Doug's Ode / Lump o' Dough /
  Old Ones / Ellie in Hot Pants  / Bars o' Pocatello /
  But For The Grace / Yerba Jose / Bob o' You Bet


     2nd Movement / "What're sharks if the drum's
                            a woman ?"

        "Two-Faced Marvels in Bicker Mode"

     ... a sequence of 12 poems paired & squared;
    a poetics dialectic via 5/4 time vs. 6/8 time ...


3rd Movement / Glanced Revelation & Resolve :

     "Awash on Eerie & Fiery Meres"

    The Teaching / 16thal / Friendly Fire /
    Tonguing Crooked Ample / Ring of Bird /
    Ballad of the Night Cove / Whale Song II /
    Do Sweetly Doom Askew / My Am Easy

=====================================================

SAHARA DATE will be performed in its entirety at 8PM on each of three
consecutive evenings:

Saturday, June 3, 2000, at Volk Gallery, 214 E. 14th St., Cincinnati
(369-0474);
Sunday, June 4, at Base Art Gallery, 1311 Main St., Cincinnati
(851-4421);
Monday, June 5, at York Street International Cafe, 8th & York,
Newport KY  (921-9039).

Music for this work was originally composed by guitarist & playwright
James Quilligan, of Philadelphia PA, who will be joining Mr. La Charity
for this series of performances.  Additionally, members of the
Cincinnati jazz collective, SaSemble, will be participating:  Richard
Williams, flamenco guitar; Jack Walker, sax & flute; Anne La Charity,
sax; Mr La Charity, congas.  All members will also play light
percussion. The dancer Mickey Morgan will be joining the company the for
performances on Sunday and Monday.

SAHARA DATE is an original blend of music & poetry which Mr. La Charity
has been developing since he first began delivering poetry while
simultaneously playing congas in 1992.  Although he considers SAHARA
DATE a work in progress, its slow maturation to its present level of
musical & poetics complexity marks an artistic breakthrough.

Just a quick note to let y'all know that this week's Mappings
includes tracks by the recently much-discussed Cecil Taylor (his
poetry, not his piano playing) as well as other work based in text or
the voice by composers Kyle Gann (Kenneth Patchen text), Joan La
Barbara (Kenny Goldsmith text), Jackson Mac Low, and Joseph
Zitt/Jonathan Matis. So have a party in RealAudio.

Once upon a time there was an ostrich.  It gave its address as London, =
Ontario, though it was hard to tell if that address was for real because =
there's not much sand up there and this particular ostrich had its head =
buried *way* deep in the sand.  In its deeply buried and worried head, the =
ostrich grappled with the question of what the fate of dissident radio =
workers in distant California, thousands of miles from the lone and level =
sands of Ontario, had to do with poetry.  Wasn't KPFA just the noise an =
ostrich made when he was spitting the sand out of his beak?  But sadly =
enough, the ostrich couldn't get its head out of the sand long or far =
enough to consider the possibility of a radio station not beholden to =
corporate sponsors ("You mean they don't advertise stuff I can buy on =
their station?  That's pretty weird").  Nor to seek the widely available =
body of information about KPFA's recent history.  Nor to learn of KPFA's =
decades-long history of arts broadcasting, and a commitment to poetry that =
could be well articulated by Jack Foley, Hank Lazer, David Bromige, and =
many other human beings whom the ostrich did occasionally e-ddress through =
a mouthful of sand.  But the ostrich's head stayed mostly in the sand =
while gleeful federal agents were fucking it from the other end and =
chortling over their luck because federal agents love nothing as much as =
they love ostriches, and our ostrich never did figure out what any of this =
had to do with poetry.  And it spluttered spitefully and sandfully about =
freedom of assembly and freedom of dissent and freedom of thought and =
freedom of lawyers to represent their clients and freedom of and freedom =
of and its poems were put on probation and never allowed to leave the =
house and it choked on its repressed words and on all that sand and it =
died and it still never did figure out what any of this had to do with =
poetry.

Dear Friends,

We are delighted to report that the second of our Paul Celan
books, THREADSUNS, translated by Pierre Joris is now available.

One of Paul Celan's most important books of poems, THREADSUNS
follows the Sun & Moon Press publication of BREATHTURN, which
received international critical acclaim. Consisting of 105
poems, arrange in five cycles, THREADSUNS was composed between
September 1965 and June 1967. If BREATHTURN was the opening gambit
of Celan's "turn," the entry into the late work, then THREADSUNS--
the volume that may have received the least amount of commentary
and analysis to date--may be said to be not only an extension or
continutation of the previous volume, but the full-blown realization
of Celan's late work.

The book is available, with pre-payment by check or money order,
at a 20% discount if ordered directly from Sun & Moon. ($13.95
less 20% = $11.16 plus $1.25 postage)

Send check or money order to

                    Sun & Moon Press
                    6026 Wilshire Boulevard
                    Los Angeles, California 90036

We also would like to announce that POLYVERSE, by Lee Ann Brown is
is now back in print. That also can be ordered at a 20% discount
($11.95 at 20% discount = $9.56 plus $1.25 postage)

And we remind you of REPUBLICS OF REALITY by Charles Bernstein
($14.95 less 20% = $11.95 plus $1.25 postage)

Thanks.

For those of you who publish Web literary magazines, words from the wise:
David Walker's column, from the Sydney Morning Herald:

________________________________________
This week, a reminder that print-trained designers need to throw away their
preconceptions when they start working on the Web.
A new study contains good news for anyone who believes in the importance of
a Web page's text. It also highlights the sharp differences between Web
pages and other text media, such as newspapers and books. And it should
send a warning message to anyone who has spent money on the sort of fancy
Web design that emphasises slick, beautiful, bandwidth-hogging graphics.
The study comes from the US-based Poynter Institute, which for many years
has studied the ways that people read newspapers.
Many such studies rely on what people say they do - a notoriously
unreliable technique. But Poynter has made great use of "eye-tracking"
studies, literally taking little movies of people's eyes as they move
across a page. Strapped into this equipment, users look like victims of a
particularly messy Borg assimilation. But the equipment lets the Poynter
Institute researchers find out what users really do. Or at least what they
really do when they're wearing half a pound of head-mounted video equipment.
When Poynter has studied newspaper readers, it has found that photos and
graphics catch the eye first. That's why newspapers like this one have been
slowly increasing the proportion of space they devote to photos and
graphics. They turned to the Web to study readers of online news - people
who visited news-related sites at least three times a week.
The Poynter Institute found its Web research subjects shared one unexpected
characteristic. When they went to news sites, they read text before they
looked at photos or other graphics. "Briefs or captions get eye fixations
first, by and large," reported the Institute on its site (www.poynter.org).
"The eyes of online news readers then come back to the photos and graphics,
sometimes not until they have returned to the first page after clicking
away to a full article." This is exactly the opposite of the behaviour
Poynter has seen in many years of newspaper eyetracking studies.
It would be dangerous to assume from this study that all Web users work
this way. Web news sites use graphics more sparingly than many other types
of sites, and the study subjects were by definition enthusiastic online
readers.
No, what's most fascinating about the Poynter study is simply that an
audience that behaved one way when exploring printed documents could behave
quite differently on the Web.
In other words, Web design assumptions based on print media experience can
lead you to exactly the wrong conclusion.
A great deal of Web site design today seems informed by a print media
sensibility. Many of today's Web designers cut their teeth in print design.
They're trying to prompt Web site visitors with elaborate and subtle
graphical clues, the sort that they believe work in print design. You can
find surprisingly little evidence that this approach succeeds.
The evidence certainly points to the conclusion that many Web site visitors
navigate and gather information by reading words, not looking at pictures.
The Poynter study adds just a little more depth to what we already know.
Words paly a key role in communicating with your visitors.
You have to use the right words, of course. Web site users don't want long
essays; they tend to be pursuing very specific needs. In Jakob Nielsen's
words: site visitors don't read; they scan. They want pointed snippets of
information. They will likely keep their visit brief: the Poynter subjects
averaged six minutes per site.
Why are so few Web design firms touting their expertise in Web copywriting?
Why do so few companies seem to care about using words that will engage,
instruct and prompt their users into action? Is it because they don't know
how to do it, because they don't care about results, or because none of
their clients are smart enough to ask?

Subject: Down with Conferences




I just had to withdraw from another damn conference - where I was slated
to speak - because I would have had to pay registration, travel, and
accommodation.

I am fucking poor. I am sick of being fucking poor. I am 57 and there are
no teaching jobs out there for me - or much else for that matter. I make
do with part-time work, but this can't compete with people who are teach-
ing and get disbursements etc. for travel and conferences.

Conferences are becoming a great filter, defusing radicality or harness-
ing it to the academy. The middle class or upper middle class or privi-
leged grad students get to associate with one another, share theory and
ideas - and the public or the poor are just simply kept out and excluded.

I understand that conferences have to make a bit of money, but if one is
invited to speak on a panel, surely they should at least waive fees. AND
THIS SHOULD BE BUILT INTO THE ORGANIZATION OF THE CONFERENCE FROM THE
BEGINNING.

But it's not and people like me - and there are others - are simply kept
in the ghetto, where if we're really lucky, we might be able to afford the
forty dollar paperbacks containing some of the conference proceedings.

I don't know if this is the same elsewhere, but at least in the United
States, the academy has succeeded in isolating itself in this fashion,
keeping people like me out, ensuring that intellectual discourse is econ-
omically purified, class and race bound for the most part.

I would like to see these conferences - in their present form - destroyed.
They do real harm to thought; like the Internet's eternal use of the words
"radical" and "revolutionary" they ensure that people like me are spoken-
for, and silenced. I can write all I want on the Net, but god forbid I
have something to say to academics _as an equal._

This isn't a minor issue, at least in Amerikka, where divisions are so
subtle that people elsewhere think we're thriving - they obviously haven't
been in my neighborhood -

> Derrida's assertions about the primacy of language

Do not exist. Or rather, were not made by him. I
suppose one could argue that there exists a body of
assertions which could be called "'Derrida''s
assertions about the primacy of language", but the
authorship of these is somewhat multiple: the NYRB
would appear to be responsible for a good many of
them.

In _Of Grammatology_, there's a discussion of the
primacy of language within structuralism - but it's a
critical discussion, mostly geared towards displacing
and interrupting the "linguisticism" Derrida finds in
the ascendant in the social sciences. He writes that
the "PROBLEM of language" (my caps) has "invaded...the
global horizon of the most diverse researches and the
most heterogenous discourses", and describes the
"inflation of the sign 'language'" as a "symptom" of a
"crisis" within a "historico-metaphysical epoch" (an
"episteme" with knobs on).

That symptomatic reading is of course contestable, but
it amounts to a strategic bracketing together of a
number of fairly well-attested phenomena - the rise of
structuralism, its recourse to Saussurian linguistics
for a model of the sign which then became a model of
cultural intelligibility, and so on - in order to
determine their common "horizon" and - crucially - to
*problematize* it. This is rather the opposite, I
think, of "asserting" the "primacy of language": it
would tend to undermine such assertions.

In any case, "plus d'une langue" is, according to
Derrida, deconstruction's "watchword".

What passes for dissidence has become cant, dogma and
the Church of Resentment.  I am not left, ipso facto I
am right. I am not right, ipso facto, I am left. I
choose not to accept the honors of a government that
has none to give. Emily Dickinson had poems that never
left her house, yet I never found her to "choke on
repressed words." Anyone not towing the Party Line -
left or right or somewhere north of Albequerque - or
expressing doubts about the subversion of the artist
by governments, whether by censorship or giving them
grants (carrot and stick) is struck down by both
sides.
If poets unionised, who would even notice? Poets not
writing for a few years would probably not make much
of a ripple in our culture, tho that could just be the
result of living in a city indifferent to the point of
hostility to its literary community.
Wherever my head may or may not be (as pointed out in
a cliched image) it is not worried. The poems come,
whether bidden or no. They are read by those who
needed to read them, and ignored by the masses. I see
no great reason it should be otherwise.
As for my remark about Mumia, it was along the lines
of "what if"... I have little doubt the man should be
set free.  But still, a writer must NOT allow
him/herself to censor a single thought.  I wish to
bring into question what can and cannot be known
through legal channels. What WOULD happen if someone
was guilty of a crime and was set free as the result
of well meaning individuals? Extremely damn unlikely,
to be sure, given any government's propensity to shaft
anyone they set their sights upon, but an interesting
notion nonetheless. What if INCONTROVERTIBLE proof
came to pass that a particular individual - whom many
have latched their political hooks into - was in fact
guilty? At which point does truth, social justice and
activism become a form of faith? If you cannot accept
possibilities, even unlikely ones, then you display
less imagination and open mindedness than a typical
scientist.
Not pretending any answers, just offering up some meat
for debate. You can decide if it is hamburger or
steak.
I have written and published many poems with a
political center to them. I work in my city as a
literary co-ordinator (without pay, lest anyone think
me a selfish, hypocritical bastard) working to improve
the community of work that is done. I have even
(GASP!) worked for Greenpeace. I found them to be
about half noble crusaders, half self-righteous jack
asses. Much like myself!
But I also belong to a generation that has inherited
the so-called revolution of the sixties. It has made
me hungover from all rhetoric. I see first hand the
way government money is spent - granted it is probably
less money than is spent on senator's perks - on art I
wouldn't even give a second glance.
My eyes are wide open and clear. I just don't think
that governments exist to solve all of our problems.

Two new wonderful publications just out from The Figures...




Clark Coolidge
On the Nameways Vol 1
$12.50

Preface

I began writing these poems in an empty moment
when I thought maybe I'd run out and had no more
to do. Snap. I found lines coming to me on waking
in the morning, insisting I follow them into odd
short poems, strange to see, indicating what I
knew not. Eventually I began writing them while
watching movies (from Hopalong Cassidy Enters to
Last Year at Marienbad) on satellite TV, a practice
reminding me of DeKooning drawing with his left
hand, Guston pen in hand watching the Watergate
coverage, and of course Kerouac scribing his Blues.
The point? Freedom. An overcoming of the obstacles
erected by any conceptions of the poem. A glee here
I hadn't felt since writing the first poems of my own
(1965). A casting off into the day's winds, feeling
light and lit, knowing I still have a long way to go,
a lot more to lose.

--Clark Coolidge

Stephen Rodefer
Mon Canard
$12.50

What makes  this book so captivating is Rodefer's ability to
orchestrate the most  eclectic range of tones and discourses: he
balances a Poundian inclusiveness with an unerring musical discipline.
Thus he achieves harmony of form  without sacrificing the "huge
looseness" (in Henry James's phrase) that makes his writing so
distinctly American. This intellectual  voracity, combined with a
democratic enthusiasm for the common tongue,  gives his poetry its
depth and breadth and brilliance. A major poet.

Interesting study, John.  I wonder how it applies to e-poetry and e
prose pieces that contain graphics and will be starting to appear, I'm
sure.  I think another point that could be made also, though, is that
I'm sure print newspaper readers' habits changed from the days of the
first papers.  One of the roles of web media, certainly, is to train the
viewer.

your generation (and mine) also is the product of misinformation and

development & maintenance/250 interest on military expenditures & retirement
pay for former military) is approximately $520 billion, about half of the
annual budget.  whereas total social spending (of which arts expenditure is
but an ash in a solar flare) is if i remember rightly well under under 10%
of the annual budget.

the senator's perks are paid for mostly by "private donations." :0

governments (or at least the us brand) seem to exist to loot your pocket (or
whatever you have that you find valuable) by forcing you to hold it out
while you face the guise of a protective parental leviathan, such a nice
kindly face.  ahh what a myth, this "state of anarchy" crap.  leviathan has
a flute these days, and apparently he does play a catchy tune, at least here
in amerika.

i will say at least the dutch constitution has welfare written into it, so
there might be something more redeeming about gov't over there, but they are
certainly not solving every person's problems over there either.  but fair
warning, i could be slipping into cant dogma or god forbid (no pun intended)
that ever-so-jealous realm of the untermensch, resentment.

thanks for your candor.  it is refreshing.

What passes for dissidence has become cant, dogma and
the Church of Resentment.  I am not left, ipso facto I
am right. I am not right, ipso facto, I am left. I
choose not to accept the honors of a government that
has none to give. Emily Dickinson had poems that never
left her house, yet I never found her to "choke on
repressed words." Anyone not towing the Party Line -
left or right or somewhere north of Albequerque - or
expressing doubts about the subversion of the artist
by governments, whether by censorship or giving them
grants (carrot and stick) is struck down by both
sides.
If poets unionised, who would even notice? Poets not
writing for a few years would probably not make much
of a ripple in our culture, tho that could just be the
result of living in a city indifferent to the point of
hostility to its literary community.
Wherever my head may or may not be (as pointed out in
a cliched image) it is not worried. The poems come,
whether bidden or no. They are read by those who
needed to read them, and ignored by the masses. I see
no great reason it should be otherwise.
As for my remark about Mumia, it was along the lines
of "what if"... I have little doubt the man should be
set free.  But still, a writer must NOT allow
him/herself to censor a single thought.  I wish to
bring into question what can and cannot be known
through legal channels. What WOULD happen if someone
was guilty of a crime and was set free as the result
of well meaning individuals? Extremely damn unlikely,
to be sure, given any government's propensity to shaft
anyone they set their sights upon, but an interesting
notion nonetheless. What if INCONTROVERTIBLE proof
came to pass that a particular individual - whom many
have latched their political hooks into - was in fact
guilty? At which point does truth, social justice and
activism become a form of faith? If you cannot accept
possibilities, even unlikely ones, then you display
less imagination and open mindedness than a typical
scientist.
Not pretending any answers, just offering up some meat
for debate. You can decide if it is hamburger or
steak.
I have written and published many poems with a
political center to them. I work in my city as a
literary co-ordinator (without pay, lest anyone think
me a selfish, hypocritical bastard) working to improve
the community of work that is done. I have even
(GASP!) worked for Greenpeace. I found them to be
about half noble crusaders, half self-righteous jack
asses. Much like myself!
But I also belong to a generation that has inherited
the so-called revolution of the sixties. It has made
me hungover from all rhetoric. I see first hand the
way government money is spent - granted it is probably
less money than is spent on senator's perks - on art I
wouldn't even give a second glance.
My eyes are wide open and clear. I just don't think
that governments exist to solve all of our problems.

 the International Concerned Family & Friends of Mumia Abu-Jamal
 organization  (ICFFMAJ) this summer.  We are a international
organization fighting for justice and freedom for Mumia Abu-Jamal.
We have many ICFFMAJ offices  throughout America and in many
other countries.  The organization was  started by the MOVE
organization here in Phila. PA and Pam and Ramona Africa are the
coordinators of the movement.  The headquarters of ICFFMAJ is
here in Phila. and we are in need of a individual who would be able
to work in the ICFFMAJ headquarters office full time for a month
or more during summer.   We are in desperate need of someone to

keep up the office.  With Mumia's court hearings coming up
things are getting more and more busy and crazy.  We need
someone to stand by Pam and support her.  If you are interested in
 volunteering at our office please call 215-476-8812 or 215-476-5416.
You can e-mail us back at ICFFMAJ@aol.com.

Roots,  Mos Def And Others For Mumia

 *Mark your calenders for June 3. That is the date when some of Hip
 Hop's most talented players will come together for a benefit concert
 at Hunter College for Mumia Abu-Jamal and victims of police
 brutality. The show's line up includes, Mos Def, Wyclef Jean, dead
 prez and Black Thought of The Roots. The following week The Roots
 head on out to the SF Bay Area to do another benefit concert for
 Mumia. It's called 'Bringing Mumia Home' and will feature a number of
 Bay Area performers including Dwayne Wiggins of Tony Toni Tone. This
 will take place at the Berkeley Community Theater on June 10th.

 For those who haven't been following the Mumia case. He's a former
 Black Panther, writer and award winning journalist who has spent the
 past 18 years on Pennsylvania's death row. He was convicted of
 killing a police officer after coming upon a scene in which his
 brother was being severely beaten by police. During the ensuing trial
 there were many who believed that the trial was distorted and crucial
 evidence that would've shed a different light on the outcome was
 disallowed. Mumia's case has drawn International attention with the
 demands that he be given a new trial. When looking at the larger
 picture, Mumia has come to represent the problems that many have with
 the rapidly expanding Prison Industrial Complex. Last week there was
 a regional March here in SF to bring attention to the Mumia case and
 more then 15 thousand people showed up. For more info on Mumia check
 out his website http://www.mumia.org. As for the upcoming 'Bring Home
 Mumia Show at the Berkeley Community Theater show  call 510-848-6767

 Update on Court Attacks on Mumia Activists (5/23/00)

 As many people have now heard, all the people who pled not guilty off the
 demonstration and CD action at the Liberty Bell in Philadelphia, last July
 3, were convicted an sentence to a $250 fine, $25 to the restitution fund,
 and one year of supervised probation. Supervised probation for an offense
 equivalent to a parking ticket is unheard of, and shows how much the Mumia
 movement is beginning to sting the government. It also represent punishmen=
t
 for the "crime" of asking for a trial.

 Those sentenced so far include Clark Kissinger, Frances Goldin, Jane
 Jackson, Paul Magno, Kim Lamberty, Mitch Cohen, and Joe Brown. The only
 other case that we know is still pending is Marcy Gayer. The conditions
 imposed on those sentenced requires them to report monthly to a probation
 officer, fill out a monthly report on their personal finances, and submit
to
 visits at home and at work by probation officers. They are further
forbidden
 to associate with convicted felons (i.e. Mumia), are require to be
employed,
 have to surrender their passports, and are not permitted to leave their
home
 federal court districts without permission of their probation officer. In
 short, the conditions are similar to those imposed some years back on
banned
 persons in apartheid South Africa.

 Needless to say, this attack is not going to deter those fighting for
 justice for Mumia. In fact, anger over these outrageous actions is going t=
o
 inspire even more activity for Mumia. Jane Jackson, an older woman confine=
d
 to a wheelchair, has been on a hunger strike to protest her treatment by
the
 courts.

 Six of those listed above have now filed notice of appeal and asked for a
 stay of sentence pending the appeal. The government has submitted a long
 brief to the appeals judge opposing any stay. People wishing to demand a
 stay and argue for overturning the convictions may write to the appeals
 judge, Hon. Bruce W. Kauffman, U.S. District Court, 601 Market Street,
 Philadelphia, PA 19106. Judge Kauffman's fax number is: 215-580-2281.

NEW MEDIA ATTENTION REFLECTS GROWING MASS ACTIVITY IN
SUPPORT OF MUMIA ABU-JAMAL'S DEMAND FOR A NEW TRIAL

The growing number of mass actions and confrontations, from the
Antioch College commencement activities to the mass rally in Madison
Square Garden on May 7, have prompted increased media attention on
Mumia's case.  It is noteworthy that the New York Times, which has
been particularly silent on Mumia's struggle, carried a major article by
Francis X. Clines in the Week in Review on May 21.  The article that
leads with a streamer "Killer or Victim?" puts Mumia's case at the
epicenter of the countrywide raging controversy on concerning the
death penalty.

The article states in part, "Mr. Abu-Jamal's cause, in any case, is
clearly flourishing. . 6,000 believers in Mr. Abu-Jamal gathered earlier
this month in Madison Square Garden in Manhattan.  And thousands
more demonstrated in European capitals, blocking some Paris
intersections.  When a five-member French delegation showed up last
month in Philadelphia with 50,000 protest signatures, their path had
been blazed by Francois Mitterrand's widow Danielle, who visited Mr.
Abu-Jamal in prison.  His cause has drawn sympathy from movie actors
and world leaders, from Ed Asner to Nelson Mandela, Amnesty
International joined the call and citing 'a pattern of events that
compromise Abu-Jamal's right to a new trial.'"

The New York Times article continues, "'It's probably the biggest
international mobilization since the Angela Davis case,' said Leonard I.
Weinglass, an experienced leftist advocate who is handling the appeal
for Mr. Abu-Jamal."

The New York Times article concludes "Even so, with the Abu-Jamal
case now entwined with the capital punishment issue, his supporters
expect a pending court decision to galvanize both causes, whether a
new execution date is set or a new trial is ordered. 'We're persisting,'
said Pam Africa, who directs the Abu-Jamal web site.  'This can only
get bigger.'"

In addition to the New York Times article, the New York Amsterdam
News, the Harlem-based African American weekly known throughout
the United States, carried the headline "Thousands Cheer Mumia" on
its front page May 11 with a cover photo of Abu-Jamal.  The
Amsterdam News coverage of the May 7 Madison Square Garden event
was a major breakthrough.

Mumia Abu-Jamal supporters are planning to pack the courtroom when
Mumia comes to court for what they hope to be an evidentiary hearing
sometime this summer.  Monica Moorehead, a coordinator of the
Millions for Mumia/International Action Center, stated that the growing
movement in support of Mr. Abu-Jamal will bring thousands of
supporters to protest at the Republican Convention on July 30 to August
2 and in Los Angeles at the Democratic Convention on August 13.

** INTERNATIONAL SUPPORT **
ABOLISH THE DEATH PENALTY!

From: moviment graffitti <movgraff@hotmail.com>

Living on the death row!

 The death penalty is still with us. Barbarism is still with us.  The state
 continues to kill in several countries like the USA, Turkey and China.
 While we condemn the death penalty everywhere, we cannot but note the
 hypocrisy of those who preach the values of human rights to the entire
world
 and than deny the basic right to life to the victims of legalised state
 murder. In 1999, the US a state killed 99 people.  It is even more worryin=
g
 that the Republican Presidential candidate Bush is a notorious supporter o=
f
 state murder.  The case of the innocent O'Dell, who was defended by the
 Pope, is still in everyone's mind.  When the justice system is pervaded
with
 racism the state's arbitrary power to kill becomes even more dangerous. On=
e
 has to keep in mind that although 12% of the U.S. population is black 50%
of
 the two million U.S. prisoners are black.  Moviment Graffitti would like t=
o
 publicise the cases of three prisoners on death row.

 Presently, a 49 year old man named Bennie E. Demps is on Death Watch, with
a
 scheduled execution date of May 31, 2000.  He was convicted and sentenced
to
 death for the 1976 of killing a fellow prisoner.  At the time of his
 warrant, Mr. Demps was waiting for a ruling that would allow for an
 evidentiary hearing based upon the surfacing of previously concealed
 documents.  Documents which could prove his innocence. Governor Jeb Bush,
 George Bush's brother signed this fourth death warrant on Mr. Demps knowin=
g
 that an appeal was still pending, and aware of the fact that there was new
 evidence which would exonerate him of this murder conviction. The followin=
g
 is an extract of an appeal written by Demps himself:

 "Quite simply I am innocent of this crime and have spent the last 22 years
 accumulating the necessary evidence to prove,
 that various Department of Correction prison officials, did indeed
 manufacture this case. The reason being they perceived me as having
 "escaped" the death penalty when in June 1972 the US Supreme Court struck
 down the death penalty commuting my sentence to life".

 Gary Graham (Shaka Sankofa), another prisoner on death row is segregated o=
n
 Texas Death Row since 19 years and, considering that his present age is 36=
,
 it is immediately obvious that he has spent on death row the longest part
of
 his life. Sankofa was just 17 years old when he was arrested and charged
 with capital murder--a violation of many international laws that no one
 under 18 should be sentenced to death. The prison where Gary is segregated
 is a maximum security unit where men that have been sentenced to death liv=
e
 like in a concentration camp.

 Since he was arrested in 1981, Sankofa has steadfastly proclaimed his
 innocence of the murder of Bobby Lambert outside a grocery store. His case
 garnered national and international support in the early 1990s. That's whe=
n
 Sankofa finally received adequate legal representation. Investigators
 uncovered what Houston police and Sankofa's original lawyer never did--tha=
t
 ballistics evidence proved his gun was not used in the murder. They also
 found that Lambert was a known drug dealer and gunrunner and was set for
 trial in Oklahoma. Most important, six eyewitnesses agreed that Sankofa wa=
s
 not the killer.

 To this day, no court has ever heard all this new information that was
 uncovered a decade after Sankofa was sent to death row. Republican
 presidential candidate Bush who signed his death warrant, has already
 "killed" a mentally ill man, a battered woman and  a person who was a
 juvenile at the time of his arrest. Bush has 128 executions under his belt
 and 20 more scheduled for this year.

 The third and more publicised case is that of Mumia Abu-Jamal  a former
 radio journalist in Philadelphia during the 1970s.  He was known as "the
 voice of the voiceless" on Philly airwaves. He was also President of the
 Association of Black Journalists in Philadelphia. In December of 1981,
Mumia
 was shot by a Philadelphia cop and almost died when he intervened in a
 street incident where his own brother was being beaten by the same cop. Th=
e
 police officer was also shot and killed, and witnesses saw other men run
 from the scene. When more police arrived, they beat Mumia before taking hi=
m
 to the hospital, and he was immediately charged with murder. As a
well-known
 radio reporter, he was a leading critic of police violence against the
 minority communities of Philadelphia.
 Mumia was given an unprepared court-appointed attorney who was later
 disbarred. When Mumia tried to represent himself, the judge barred him fro=
m
 most of his own trial. The political motivation of the prosecution was mad=
e
 clear when the prosecutor, arguing for the death penalty, read
revolutionary
 quotations from an interview with Mumia published ten years earlier.
 A worldwide movement has grown in the last few years demanding a new trial=
=2E
 The world's leading human rights organisation: Amnesty International has
 called for a new trial in the case of Mumia Abu Jamal on the basis that hi=
s
 original trial was deeply flawed.
 "This is not about an issue affecting the life of just one man. This is
 about justice -- which affects us all. And justice, in this case, can only
 be served by a new trial," Amnesty International said.
 Moviment Graffitti appeals to all people of good will to write letters of
 protest against the death penalty to the Maltese U.S. Ambassador:
 Her Excellency the Ambassador, The Embassy of the U.S.A. Floriana.

Dear Friends,

The FBI is continuing their misinformation campaign against Leonard Peltier=
=2E
Their letters are still popping up in papers accross the country. However,
many of our responses and letters are being printed as well.  Below is a
good rebuttal written in a Denver paper by Prof. Morris.  Please continue t=
o
keep an eye out for the FBI's letters and be sure to send us copies in the
mail.  If the FBI has not submitted anything in your paper, you can still
submit a letter of your own before they do.

Please keep up phone calls to the White House, Congress, and Reno.  Don't
forget to organize phone banks to Janet Reno's office on June 9th and let u=
s
know if a vigil is being planned on June 11 in your region.  We cannot let
them obstuct Leonard's chances of receiving long overdue justice this year.
Thank you.

Solidarity,

Published Monday, May 15, 2000 in the Denver Rocky Mountain News:

Speakout section

Truth must lead to pardoning of Peltier
by Professor Glenn Morris

In reporting the FBI's lates campaign to defame imprisoned American Indian
activist Leonard Peltier (April 22 article, "FBI fights to prevent a pardon
for Peltier"),the Denver Rocky Mountain News repeated several factual error=
s
and pieces of FBI disinformation that deserve correction. At the outset, it
should be stated that Leonard Peltier has now spent 23 years in federal
prison for crimes that he did not commit. His convictions on the charges
that he murdered two FBI agents were secured through perjured affidavits an=
d
testimony, exculpatory evidence was concealed by the FBI, and a judiciary
has consistently ignored truth and justice in the case.
Peltier's case has been examined by some of the finest legal minds in the
world, with the respected human rights organization Amnesty International
(AI) concluding that Peltier should be released immediately. AI has been
joined in its plea for Peltier's freedom by millions of others, including
Nobel Peace Prize laureates Nelson Mandela, the late Mother Teresa, the Dal=
a
i Lama, Rigoberta Menchu and Desmond Tutu. In the article reprinted in the
News. some of the scurrilous tactics of the FBI's smear campaign were
revealed when the FBI continued to suggest that Peltier had  attempted to
kill other police officers in Milwaukee prior to the 1975 Pine Ridge Indian
Reservation shootout that left one Indian and two FBI agents dead. The FBI
omits the fact that Peltier was acquitted of all charges in the Milwaukee
case. It also neglects to mention that the case was fabricated by two
Milwaukee police officers who set Peltier up, in their own words, to catch
"a big one for the FBI."

Today, given revelations in such cases as Rubin "Hurricane" Carter, the Los
Angeles police department's Rampart Division scandal, and Denver's own Mena
case, we know that the capacity of police agencies (including the FBI) to
railroad innocent individuals for political or racial purposes, is virtuall=
y
boundless. As documented in Peter Matthiessen's award-winning book, In the
Spirit of Crazy  Horse, the FBI attempted to conceal its own ballistics
tests which excluded Peltier's purported gun as the one that killed the FBI
agents. Before the 8th Circuit Court of Appeals, the U.S. prosecutor
admitted to the court that " we can't prove who shot those agents." Later,
on CBS' 60 Minutes, the same prosecutor, Lynn Crooks, defended his and the
FBI's conduct in the Peltier case, claiming that he didn't think that "we
did anything wrong, but I can tell you, it don't bother my conscience one
whit if we did." Such is the nature of "justice" in the Peltier case.

Despite the FBI's attempts to spread lies about Peltier and his trial,
people of goodwill should examine the facts for themselves. Those who are
persuaded by truth and justice will join the international call for
presidential clemency for the most renowned political prisoner in the Unite=
d
States, Leonard Peltier.

Five posts from “DRn” have appeared here this month, with a subject line
beginning “M&R”. They haven’t been very interesting or informative. I
responded
to one: the one attacking Whalen and A. Berrigan.

I thought that would be the end of it. The writer (I still don’t know if “DRn”
is the same person as the e-mail address indicates: “Harry Nudel
nudel-soho@MINDSPRING.COM” presents him/herself as someone on the margins
of the
poetry world (or “scene”what a stupid word), attacking crusty old stalwarts
who
have “made” it, taking swings at the reputations of “respectable” poets and
“alternative” or avant-garde alike. Oh, how radical!

Well, there is something admirable about this on the surface. You think
someone’s out there standing up for their aesthetic, fighting for what they
believe in (however low or sexist the posts come across as), and so on.

But it’s not so. Maybe you all knew this already. Maybe the joke’s on me. The
aesthetic stance has a currency conversion rate. Nudel’s a literary mosquito.

For example, he writes (5/1/00) “At the Church...Baraka is almost
finishing...and seeing no reason to pay 7 dolllars...we wait for
half-time...”

Does this say struggling artist or big cheap guy? Won’t pay to hear poetry
reading. I know people who painfully part with money at poetry readings. Some
of them really need it. The next thing should have given me more of a clue:

Nudel: “Finally in....I think whether to get Baraka to sign some stuff...but
since I have circa 20-30 signed Baraka's & am computing the odds as to who;s
going to kick off first”

Twenty to thirty signed books can only mean two things: a very serious fan of
the writer or a book dealer. Whether Nudel is a fan of Baraka or not is not
interesting to me. He is a book dealer tho; a “rare” book dealer, worst kind.
Read on.

[Aside: “kick off first”? standard thought process of the rare bookseller?]

Harry wouldn’t pay 7 bucks at St. Marks. If anyone in the audience who didn’t
have multiple signed copies of Baraka’s work and wanted one, they would
have to
pay a lot for them. (Let’s back up. If Baraka was signing books that night,
they’re probably all set.)
But what can Harry offer them?

Baraka, Amiri Imamu RAISE RACE RAYS RAZE
NY Random House 1971 1st Edition, Fine in About Fine D.J., SIGNED and dated
1978
Price: US$ 175.00

Ouch!

Baraka, Imamu Amiri AFRIKAN REVOLUTION
New Ark Jihad 1973 16mo, brown wrappers, Fine 1st Edition, an 8 page pamphlet
Price: US$ 30.00

That’s $3.75 per page.

Jones, Leroi THE DEAD LECTURER
NY Gove 1964 1st Edition, Fine in VG price-clipt D.J.,INSCRIBED at a later
date
as Baraka
Price: US$ 300.00

I love the “INSCRIBED at a later date as Baraka.” At some “later date” Harry
Nudel (or similar kin) slipped past the collector at the door of the poetry
reading and significantly increased what had probably been only a modest
"investment". Probably got some free wine and cheese in the deal as well.

When we next hear from Nudel (5/8/00) we see he’s been attending something or
other with a real bad attitude and taking down lots of names but not taking
any
prisoners. Oh, gotta get me to New York!

Of attendees he writes: “a bunch of women...the usual variety of commercial
vanity publishers..Knopf, Farrar&Co, New Directions,...[whom he was eyeing for
Advance Copies no doubt],  Robert Pinski, Mr. poetry lite...rd the shirt
poem....”

Pinsky? Poetry lite or no, Nudel is looking to pick up $150 for the
following:

Pinsky, Robert AN EXPLANATION OF AMERICA
Princeton U.P. 1979 1st Edition, Fine in About Fine D.J.with a smidgen of
soil,
Review Copy with slip (H24-5) . Book # 1828

Nudel lets another slam loose on the Buff list, but in the Nudel Books-list
there is a quite more moderate tone.

Buff list: “This is the 2nd male poet, remember to forget Robert Hass, who
like
Reagan was perfecto for the Prez role... is perfecto for the role of poet
lauriate, rugged charming professionally oily, rite the post alzheimer
Reagan…”


Nudel Books:
“Haas, Robert FIELD GUIDE
New Haven Yale 1973 Stiff wrappers, 1st Edition, about Fine. Book # 1600
Price: US$ 20.00”

I love it when book dealers write that a book has “stiff wrappers.” It really
fetishizes the commodity. And there’s no doubt that Harry is really getting
off
on these prices. For example:

"Haas, Robert LETTER
Buffalo Slow Loris Press 1971 4to, a Broadside, vg+, stains on verso, limited
to 200 copies. Rare, I haven't seen another copy in 25 years.
Price: US$ 375.00"

You see, there are stains on verso. That’s code, people, code!

Nine days later, Nudel posts again. This is the sharpest (and most morbid)
take
on the contemporary “scene” he gives us yet. It is titled “M&R...we have come
to bury the dead....”

Part anti-book catalog rant against Stanley Kunitz, it concludes:  “Prob.
drinking and dating his students....why can't we just bury the dead in stiff
academic gowns and let them molder forever...DRn...”

While Stanley molders, you can pick up a copy of his TESTING TREE (NY:
Atlantic, 1971, first edition) for a mere $115. It is, the dealer writes,
“fine
in glassine.” Now THAT’S poetry.

Also available, is Kunitz’s THE TESTING TREE (NY: Atlantic, 1973) which is
ALSO
a first edition, as well as signed by the Moldering One’s dead hand, and if
you
hand $45 into the hand of Nudel it’s all yours.

[Not a bibliographer, but confused on the cataloging above. Something about
adding “The” to the second First edition makes it brand new all over again?]

More stiff wrappers are found around Whalen’s SEVERANCE PAY, which is a great
book, but I know it can be found for less than $20. Especially since the
bookseller here omits his opinion that Whalen’s writing is often
“tendentious…cultural patter” or that admirers might try sticking a sharp
object into the author’s heart in search of blood.

Just a nutty bookseller? Ignored? Wandering lower Manhattan with hurt feelings
for a failed poetry career?

Nudel has 7 books by Ted Berrigan for sale with a value (HIS value) of almost
$40,000 dollars.

Nudel: I think you’re a vampire.

At some event-or-other in May, Nudel laments: “The culture wars continue apace
but one thing this panel is sure to agree on is that I WON'T be the next
winner
of 100 Grand TANNING prize...you can put money on that..”

Or you can spend it at 135 Spring Street; Harry Nudel books.

Subject:      Re: Fw: Down with Conferences

I agree that this is a problem -- a class/privilege issue
that permeates all of intellectual life. I am off to the
American Literature Association conference tomorrow. To
their credit, as a "independent scholar" (i.e., someone
not affiliated with a university) I only had to pay $10 to
register for the conference. But as the poster below
notes, there are travel and accommodation costs which I
must bear in order to be allowed the privilege of
presenting a paper and participating in the kind of
"community" and opportunity which a conference can
provide.
For those in the academy, I think the kind of
institutional support one gets for these things varies
widely, depending on how wealthy the institution with
which one is affiliated. So, yes, this can be a situation
where those with privilege get more privilege and so on
and so on, getting the kind of opportunities vital to
creating an academic career, should one choose to do so.
I don't think the answer is to abolish conferences (though
I understand the kind of frustration the leads to that
conclusion.) Rather there should be a mechanism where fees
can be waived for those who can't afford to pay. Yes, this
is a lot work, but would contribute to the overall
vitality and dare I say, "diversity" of presentations.

A plea from a list reader who nearly always gets his mail at work - Please
don't send messages with MS Word attachments. I might be willing
(grudgingly) to accept the possibility of a macro virus or two at home
(friends send me work like that all the time, I get a new virus every few
months). But when it's a matter of possibly bringing down the whole network
here in the office, I'd rather not be the one explaining that "I just have
to have my poetry announcements."

Just to be clear - this one scanned clean just now, and I'm certainly not
trying for a tone of accusation here. But copying and pasting into the body
of an email should only take an extra few seconds, and saves us all the
risk.

anything by any of the confessionals --lowell, bishop, plath, sexton,
snodgrass, etc. "Kaddish" is a masterpiece in this vein.  i also sometimes
think of "America" as one side of a dialogue between an older jewish couple
trapped in an unhealthy symbiosis --that's where much of the humor comes
from, the intimacy and the "yr getting on my nerves again"  tone.

Liz,

What comes to mind most strongly are not *poems* but novels-- specificially
Janey's incestuous relationship with her father in Kathy Acker's _Blood and
Guts in High School_, and Leopold & Molly Bloom in _Ulysses_.  As for
POETRY: Rimbaud's "Poets de Sept Ans" for starters and (although it's a play
it is still poetry) King Lear.

damaged life


someone dies, it's a movement of the lips: language of tune or song,
language of truth. for when someone dies, there is the sign of speech,
and that is about it. and when this happens, there is always an absence,
always one less shadow to contend with. and you will try and bring back
that shadow in as many ways as possible, fill in the outlines, until the
world outside begins to change as well. and when that happens, there
will be no place for the shadow, there will be nothing but emptiness,
and for a while there will be images and things and names. and then the
images and things and names will disappear as well, and you will know
all of this because you will be on the cusp of the shadow. you will see
someone slipping away into the shadow. you will see the shadow growing
faint, but you will not see the background coming forward, as if there
were translucency; instead, there will be a faintness, and the buzz of
the world everywhere, louder and louder, as if you are being drowned.
and for you the world will consist of such drownings, you will be gasp-
ing for the sound of air, for the pleasure of a breath. and you will
know at this very moment that the cusp is permanent, that the world is
constituted by such cusps, that, for you, the world rasps against
itself, that this is the nature of the world. for something familiar is
gone forever, and the new things that appear around you are increasingly
uncanny, on the other of the fantasm; it is as if they were intent on
corroding whatever has been real. and it will be their triumph in the
very long run; there will be only fantasms and then there will be
nothing at all, and no deaths, not even slow churnings. but you cannot
imagine that, so you will continue to sing the language of truth, as if
this language, this singing, were a consideration, and you are dreaming
when you think, as long as there is breath. but what the world is, what
the world always is, is louder and louder, and increasing buzz. and
there is no room for thinking the death for which you are witness; there
is buzz alone, and nothing can be thought, not now, not forever. (i will
think of this when i write this, when i send this missive to you, as a
flood of words, as a memorial to an other time, as a memorial to times
in which deaths occurred, which seemed to be remembered.)

I would like to thank Dan Bouchard
for taking the time to criticize these several posts
by Harry Nudel.  Having had the strange sensation
that a response to these completely damaged and
bilious posts would only feed into some strange
and provocative instinct on the part of Dr. Nudel,
I chose not to post a response. Both Dan's response
and Chris Funkhouser's updated review have made me feel differently.
It is best to immediately check even the most obvious and
desperate of cheap shots.  Thanks to you both.
And so, let me check in briefly. Having chosen
Amiri Baraka's reading at the Poetry Project
and Anselm Berrigan's review of Philip Whalen's _Overtime_
as targets for this silly and insidious e-needling
just reinforces how completely out of touch
this Dr. Nudel must be.  Both the reading and the review
were brilliant....No question....This (ahem) criticism is
just laughable.

Sent: Wednesday, May 24, 2000 12:45 PM

Subject: Rad Lit Crit and a Whole lot of Money


Five posts from “DRn” have appeared here this month, with a subject line
beginning “M&R”. They haven’t been very interesting or informative. I
responded
to one: the one attacking Whalen and A. Berrigan.

I thought that would be the end of it. The writer (I still don’t know if
“DRn”
is the same person as the e-mail address indicates: “Harry Nudel
nudel-soho@MINDSPRING.COM” presents him/herself as someone on the margins
of the
poetry world (or “scene”what a stupid word), attacking crusty old stalwarts
who
have “made” it, taking swings at the reputations of “respectable” poets and
“alternative” or avant-garde alike. Oh, how radical!

Well, there is something admirable about this on the surface. You think
someone’s out there standing up for their aesthetic, fighting for what they
believe in (however low or sexist the posts come across as), and so on.

But it’s not so. Maybe you all knew this already. Maybe the joke’s on me.
The
aesthetic stance has a currency conversion rate. Nudel’s a literary
mosquito.

For example, he writes (5/1/00) “At the Church...Baraka is almost
finishing...and seeing no reason to pay 7 dolllars...we wait for
half-time...”

Does this say struggling artist or big cheap guy? Won’t pay to hear poetry
reading. I know people who painfully part with money at poetry readings.
Some
of them really need it. The next thing should have given me more of a clue:

Nudel: “Finally in....I think whether to get Baraka to sign some stuff...but
since I have circa 20-30 signed Baraka's & am computing the odds as to who;s
going to kick off first”

Twenty to thirty signed books can only mean two things: a very serious fan
of
the writer or a book dealer. Whether Nudel is a fan of Baraka or not is not
interesting to me. He is a book dealer tho; a “rare” book dealer, worst
kind.
Read on.

[Aside: “kick off first”? standard thought process of the rare bookseller?]

Harry wouldn’t pay 7 bucks at St. Marks. If anyone in the audience who didn’
t
have multiple signed copies of Baraka’s work and wanted one, they would
have to
pay a lot for them. (Let’s back up. If Baraka was signing books that night,
they’re probably all set.)
But what can Harry offer them?

Baraka, Amiri Imamu RAISE RACE RAYS RAZE
NY Random House 1971 1st Edition, Fine in About Fine D.J., SIGNED and dated
1978
Price: US$ 175.00

Ouch!

Baraka, Imamu Amiri AFRIKAN REVOLUTION
New Ark Jihad 1973 16mo, brown wrappers, Fine 1st Edition, an 8 page
pamphlet
Price: US$ 30.00

That’s $3.75 per page.

Jones, Leroi THE DEAD LECTURER
NY Gove 1964 1st Edition, Fine in VG price-clipt D.J.,INSCRIBED at a later
date
as Baraka
Price: US$ 300.00

I love the “INSCRIBED at a later date as Baraka.” At some “later date” Harry
Nudel (or similar kin) slipped past the collector at the door of the poetry
reading and significantly increased what had probably been only a modest
"investment". Probably got some free wine and cheese in the deal as well.

When we next hear from Nudel (5/8/00) we see he’s been attending something
or
other with a real bad attitude and taking down lots of names but not taking
any
prisoners. Oh, gotta get me to New York!

Of attendees he writes: “a bunch of women...the usual variety of commercial
vanity publishers..Knopf, Farrar&Co, New Directions,...[whom he was eyeing
for
Advance Copies no doubt],  Robert Pinski, Mr. poetry lite...rd the shirt
poem....”

Pinsky? Poetry lite or no, Nudel is looking to pick up $150 for the
following:

Pinsky, Robert AN EXPLANATION OF AMERICA
Princeton U.P. 1979 1st Edition, Fine in About Fine D.J.with a smidgen of
soil,
Review Copy with slip (H24-5) . Book # 1828

Nudel lets another slam loose on the Buff list, but in the Nudel Books-list
there is a quite more moderate tone.

Buff list: “This is the 2nd male poet, remember to forget Robert Hass, who
like
Reagan was perfecto for the Prez role... is perfecto for the role of poet
lauriate, rugged charming professionally oily, rite the post alzheimer
Reagan…”


Nudel Books:
“Haas, Robert FIELD GUIDE
New Haven Yale 1973 Stiff wrappers, 1st Edition, about Fine. Book # 1600
Price: US$ 20.00”

I love it when book dealers write that a book has “stiff wrappers.” It
really
fetishizes the commodity. And there’s no doubt that Harry is really getting
off
on these prices. For example:

"Haas, Robert LETTER
Buffalo Slow Loris Press 1971 4to, a Broadside, vg+, stains on verso,
limited
to 200 copies. Rare, I haven't seen another copy in 25 years.
Price: US$ 375.00"

You see, there are stains on verso. That’s code, people, code!

Nine days later, Nudel posts again. This is the sharpest (and most morbid)
take
on the contemporary “scene” he gives us yet. It is titled “M&R...we have
come
to bury the dead....”

Part anti-book catalog rant against Stanley Kunitz, it concludes:  “Prob.
drinking and dating his students....why can't we just bury the dead in stiff
academic gowns and let them molder forever...DRn...”

While Stanley molders, you can pick up a copy of his TESTING TREE (NY:
Atlantic, 1971, first edition) for a mere $115. It is, the dealer writes,
“fine
in glassine.” Now THAT’S poetry.

Also available, is Kunitz’s THE TESTING TREE (NY: Atlantic, 1973) which is
ALSO
a first edition, as well as signed by the Moldering One’s dead hand, and if
you
hand $45 into the hand of Nudel it’s all yours.

[Not a bibliographer, but confused on the cataloging above. Something about
adding “The” to the second First edition makes it brand new all over again?]

More stiff wrappers are found around Whalen’s SEVERANCE PAY, which is a
great
book, but I know it can be found for less than $20. Especially since the
bookseller here omits his opinion that Whalen’s writing is often
“tendentious…cultural patter” or that admirers might try sticking a sharp
object into the author’s heart in search of blood.

Just a nutty bookseller? Ignored? Wandering lower Manhattan with hurt
feelings
for a failed poetry career?

Nudel has 7 books by Ted Berrigan for sale with a value (HIS value) of
almost
$40,000 dollars.

Nudel: I think you’re a vampire.

At some event-or-other in May, Nudel laments: “The culture wars continue
apace
but one thing this panel is sure to agree on is that I WON'T be the next
winner
of 100 Grand TANNING prize...you can put money on that..”

Or you can spend it at 135 Spring Street; Harry Nudel books.

Slid from the kitchen shelf;
My mother's countenance
Could not unfrown itself.

The hand that held my wrist
Was battered on one knuckle;
At every step you missed
My right ear scraped a buckle.

You beat time on my head
With a palm caked hard by dirt,
Then waltzed me off to bed,
Still clinging to your shirt.

The command line prompt needs no help form you^^^^^^^rom you. There is

it is there that you may enter tenxt, m^^^^^^xt, may finger-dance upon
your keyboard. From that moment on, it is a sis^nisiter. It^^^^^^^^ter.
It is a sinister because it is neither below nor adjacent; it may be
anywhere; it may be upon the movement of the arrow keys, or the
enter/return key; it may be nowhere at all; it may lock itself up; it
may close itself down. But just for aninstant^^^^^^^ instant, there you
are in control.^^^^^^^^^ cont-rol^^^^^^^^^ cont- rol. For example, if
you enter dir *, then you will have a directory and another command

h^will have a dash ed line to fill, you will have a noose around your
neck, clso^^osing in a^on you, you will have the alphabet at your
disposal, one letter or^^at a time. Or you may enter yes at the prompt,
watch the high-speed scrolling and your inability, for the most part, to
stop it, until you carsh yo^^^^^^^rash out of the machine or switch to
another screen. Yo^^Or you may enter kill -0 or some such and find
yourself out of the program altogether, exiting, with nowhere to go but
reboot or re-enter, depending on your rakig. ^^^^^nking.

You may find yourself at the top of thepage, a^^^^^^^ screen, and you

=E0=E0=E0 =E0 re-enter, as if you had just been killed in a MUD, another fo=

movement of the fingers, you f^will find ou^^yourself speechless,
thoughtless, imageless, in a continuous state of nervous movement,
excitation, looping the language back through the mind, looping in and

Now I'm not one all that comfortable with the binary distinction between
"major" and "minor" poets but Charles Bernstein his one of the most
significant poets of our day and one of his primary subattitudes has been a
visceral antipathy towards Romanticism. But has anyone heard him reading from
the libretto to his new opera on Walter Benjamin, from which he read at the
Poetry Project on May 24. The libretto seems excessively Romantic. It
includes a dialogue between Benjamin and Holderlin on the living the dead,
interogations of Benjamin by spirits, and an epilogue by Benjamin's/Klee's
"angel of history." An opera, writes Adorno in his essay "Bourgouis Opera"
(in _Sound Figures_) includes the employment of song to overcome alienation
and return the subject to nature, also a Romantic impulse. Music, he says,
must compose with a hammer as Nietzche wrote with a hammer, and the composer
of the opera, a section of which I heard, who writes in the serialist
tradition Adorno championed, certainly does compose with a hammer. (funny
Adorno and Benjamin intersecting here). Anyhow, when I mentioned this to
someone, he responded that Bernstein was affecting for effect, not really
embracing Romanticism. I'm not so sure. Is this another sort of Romanticism.
How sincere is Bernstein? What does this say about sincerity, Romanticism?
Anyone who has heard from the libretto care to comment (Brian you were there)
-- has Papa Bear embraced his arch-enemy?

Right on, Kathy!
How was the conference (since you'll probably be back by the time you read
this...)

I'm surprised that the existence of "independent scholars" is recognized at
all, and quite happy that the ALA can see over the wall/beyond the tower,
etc.  Independent scholars and self-determined gatecrashers serve as
"outreach workers" because they often take information from these events to
areas underserved or outright ignored by academe.  The ways in which I have
made my way into expensive conferences are myriad and, if I may so myself,
quite creative.

I agree with Kathy that conferences should not be abolished, even just
academic ones, but I do feel that their fee structure needs to be
redesigned, and efforts at dissemination need to be more creative and
continuous.   The trickle-down from academic reviews to more popular can
take years, resulting in unfortunate dumbing down as well.

Here's one by Philip Larkin, assuming that dysfunction is the norm, with
others following, not by Larkin.

THIS BE THE VERSE

They fuck you up, your mum and dad.
They may not mean to, but they do.
They fill you with the faults they had
And add some extra just for you.

But they were fucked up in their turn
By fools in old-style hats and coats,
Who half the time were soppy-stern
And half at one another’s throats.

Man hands on misery to man.
It deepens like a coastal shelf.
Get out as early as you can.
And don’t have any kids yourself.


Marianne Moore, "Silence" (Complete Poems 91)

John Yau in _My Symptoms_, starting with the title poem and those around it
(prose poems).  Also some prose in _Hawaiian Cowboys_, esp. "Family Album"
(opening sentence: "I like to watch a woman undress, while my brother likes
to wear women's dresses")

Timothy Liu (gay son, ineffective father, domineering mother & stepmother)
from _Say Goodnight_ (Copper Canyon, 1998):
"Crepuscule with Mother" and the next three
from _Burnt Offerings_ (Copper Canyon, 1995):
"Thoreau"
"Men Without" and the next two

Kyoko Mori, _Fallout_ (Tia Chucha, 1994) quite a few poems, as I remember
(Japanese heritage, distant and abusive father, wicked stepmother)

Title poem (and other interconnected poems) from David Mura's _The Colors of
Desire_; check _After We Lost Our Way_ also.

PB Shelley's or Blake's reading of Milton (see Harold Bloom)

CALLING ALL POETS, BARDS, AND BILLIONAIRES
TO SF BAY FOR SUBLIME TRANSNATIONAL TASK, "A Colossal Rhetoric":

A Colossal Vision for San Francisco Bay
--by Lawrence Ferlinghetti
San Francisco Chronicle, April 30, 2000

            The New Colossus Not like the brazen giant of
                        Greek fame, With conquering limbs astride
                        from land to land; Here at our sea-washed, sunset
                        gates shall stand A mighty woman with a torch,
                        whose flame Is the imprisoned lightning,
                        and her name Mother of Exiles. From her
                        beacon-hand Glows world-wide welcome;
                        her mild eyes command the air-bridged harbor that
                        twincities frame. ``Keep, ancient lands, your
                        storied pomp!'' cries she With silent lips. ``Give
me
                        your tired, your poor, Your huddled masses
yearning
                        to breathe free, The wretched refuse of your
                        teeming shore. Send these, the homeless,
                        tempest-tost to me, I lift my lamp beside the
golden
                        door!
                        Emma Lazarus, the author of the above poem
inscribed on
                        the Statue of Liberty, was born in New York City
of
                        Sephardic Jewish parents in 1849. In 1883 (in
despair
                        over the bloody massacre of Jews living in Russia,
which
                        forced many to flee for their lives and come to
                        America), she wrote ``The New Colossus.'' It was
first
                        used to raise money for the construction of a
statue to
                        bear the full title of ``Liberty Enlightening the
                        World.''
                        ``The brazen giant of Greek fame'' was no doubt
the
                        Colossus of Rhodes, a statue to the sun god Helios
that
                        was one of the Seven Wonders of the
World. According to
                        legend, it straddled the harbor at Rhodes in the
Aegean,
                        with ships passing between its legs, but it was
actually
                        on a promontory overlooking the harbor. (Among
colossi
                        of later times, there's the Great Buddha at
Kamakura,
                        Japan, and two figures of Christ in South
America.)
                        People today have mixed reactions when they read
this
                        chestnut of a poem, especially when they get to
the part
                        that begins, ``Give me your tired.'' Lazarus wrote
her
                        stirring sonnet when America was young and the
continent
                        still full of great empty, fertile spaces. Today
one
                        wonders how many Americans would like to change
the
                        opening lines to read: ``Don't give me your tired,
your
                        poor, your huddled masses.'' What verses might be
                        forthcoming if we were to call for a completely
revised
                        version of her poem to be inscribed on the statue?
                        With surging overpopulation putting enormous
pressures
                        on all nations of the world, with huge battles
over
                        immigration in all the Western democracies, our
own
                        doors are not nearly as open as they used to
be. It
                        takes a year and a half to get a first appointment
with
                        a U.S. immigration officer, and that's after
filling out
                        an application that would strain the literacy of
many
                        Americans.
                        Someday there may be a world without borders,
given the
                        transmigration of cultures, which is the
inevitable
                        result of the electronic revolution. The Internet,
                        e-mail, fax, the cell phone and multinational
                        corporations have small respect for national
boundaries.
                        And while political borders still exist, human
ones
                        don't, so that we have mass culture ``in transit''
                        between countries such as the United States and
Mexico
                        (artist Guillermo Gomez-Pena exemplifies this).
                        But until the advent of the borderless world, what
about
                        a new Statue of Liberty on Alcatraz Island in San
                        Francisco Bay to herald our new age? The original
statue
                        cost $800,000. Our new colossus might be made for
a
                        billion, give or take a Silicon Valley millionaire
or
                        two. Perhaps some newspaper or TV station would
like to
                        undertake the campaign?
                        I would envision a new colossus exactly as large
as the
                        one in New York harbor, standing a full 305 feet
above
                        the water, facing outward to the Pacific basin and
                        making San Francisco the symbolic Western gateway
to
                        America. What better way to remain a
``world-class''
                        city?
                        I would also envision myriad poets and sculptors
and
                        architects proposing their visions for such a new
                        colossus, with everything from old-fashioned
rhymed
                        verse to rap poetry, from conventional figurative
                        sculpture to postmodern abstraction and
                        ``site-specific'' conceptual art.
                        What might be the message of a new poem to be
inscribed
                        on it? And what gesture would the new statue be
making?
                        Would it have raised fists in a defensive stance,
or
                        even carry an automatic weapon ready to shoot?
                        Or should it still extend welcoming arms to the
hordes
                        of new immigrants yearning for freedom from
tyranny and
                        poverty? (The parallels with the 1880s are
striking.)
                        And would the figure of the new statue be male or
female
                        or unisex, black or white or brown, to truly
represent
                        our 21st century ethnicity? And might we further
                        enlighten the world by calling it a Statue of
Liberty
                        and Equality?
                        Such, such are the joys, the inspiring
opportunities and
                        the poetic possibilities in such a colossal
vision.
                        Lawrence Ferlinghetti preceded Janice Mirikitani
as San
                        Francisco's poet laureate.

Other ideas on this thread:

Larkin's poem beginning "They fuck you up, your mum and dad." (Though was it
here a few years ago that someone wrote of their suspicion that Larkin had
in fact written "They muck you up..." and surfed the wave of a typo into
literary history, or something fairly close to that?)

Another from the gamey-smelling hinterlands of the mainstream, Roethke's "My
Papa's Waltz," which, little patience as I have for his work, succeeds (if
you want to call it that) in giving me the willies after repeated readings.

Many of the domestic narratives from Reznikoff's first five or so books, as
ordered in the Black Sparrow Collected Poems.

Plath is obvious, but do it anyway.

Mina Loy's "Anglo-Mongrels and the Rose" - long, hard-to-find, difficult -
depends on your interest in pedagogical perversity.

Oscar Wilde's Salome (not a poem, but worth a look)

Since someone else mentioned novels - Kafka, Kafka, Kafka; Proust, Proust,
Proust. This is almost the equivalent of clinical literature on the subject.

And, skipping back a bit, the Odyssey (a too-literal commitment to the ideal
of fidelity can be dysfunctional too, as recognized in my grandmother's
habit of reading to me from the Odyssey [old lefties tend to have fairly
conservative maps of the high-water marks of culture] and always stopping
short just before the slaying of the suitors. For years, I thought the poem
had a sort of ambiguous fade-out of a happy ending. Just think of the bills
for meds and therapy a 20th century Telemachus would run up).

Of course, the farther away from the 19th and 20th century bourgeois family
you get, the more you're dealing in anachronism, a kind of imaginative
projection of a contemporary category onto historical realities that don't
really fit the bill. But it seems to me that fronting this kind of cognitive
dissonance could be half the fun, and a good way to get at what exactly we
mean by an adjective like "dysfunctional."

I just got "volunteered" to run a poetry slam in my
area. I have never been to one. I have never seen one
(except once on TVOs Imprint) and am completely over
my head. Any practical info anyone might care to toss
my way on the nitty-gritty of poetry slams would be
most appreciated. Thanks!

Agreed on the confessionals.  Also, Yusef Komanyaka's poem about his
father's hands.  Check out Molly Peacock.  She says she uses form because
she's writing about such intense abuse stuff that she needs a way to
contain it.  Most notable of all probably, Sapphire's "American Dream."
Dorothy Allison also has a book of poems, "The Women Who Hate Me" that is
in the same vein as her novel "Bastards out of Carolina."

your students will probably be familiar with the movie _trainspotting_,
yes?  and some, hopefully, with the book?  irvine welsh recently
published a novel in the UK calleed _malibu stork nightmares_, which
deals very richly with a profoundly dysfunctional family.  the prose is
all gnarled and spattered and really beautiful, too.  not for kids of all
ages, but checkitout.

what happens when there's a door fee for a reading anyway?
well, let me think for a minute here--
i know it varies, depending on the situation,
but maybe, just maybe...
some possibilities:
maybe the reading poet(s) might get paid.
maybe the reading poet(s) might get paid enough to cover their travel
expenses, shd they have any.
maybe the place holding the event gets some money for rent, going to things
such as facilities/equipment maintenance, upgrades to facilities/equipment,
payment to maintenance personnel, compliance w/ever-changing bldg codes,
etc...going to the continuation of the venue's viability as site for future
readings.
maybe the person/foundation/individual organizing the event gets some money
to pay for publicity, postage, paper to print on, a desk in an office, a
chair, a lightbulb, etc.
maybe the person/foundation/individual organizing the event gets some money
to pay for future events, or for programs that don't receive funds, or to pay
off bills incurred from another reading not so well attended.
maybe the person/foundation/individual organizing the event might pay someone
a little bit for time spent putting together events. it might buy that person
meals, pay rent...you know, the things a job, a paycheck can do for a person.
so maybe $7 for a reading isn't so much after all.

I understand from the below message that the heat on the Yugoslavian
students resisting the Milosevic government is going to increase
significantly in the next few days.

Please take a moment to voice support for the students of Yugoslavia and
their Otpor (Resistance) movement by visiting
http://www.vispo.com/TheFist/Students.html where you can copy one or several
of various graphics of THE FIST, their graphic of Otpor, and put it on your
Web site.

The student Web site is at http://otpor.com . There is considerable
information, and graphics, available there.

Supporting the students by putting THE FIST on your site and linking the
graphic to http://otpor.com (or wherever you wish to direct people to
express their support also) is something useful we can do rather than
bombing them.

Regards,
Jim Andrews

Just one more question. Is there any support campaign or activity on

your website. The moment is certainly now. The serbian government is going
to crack down on the students in the coming days using a new

Philip Larkin wrote the quintessential dysfunctional family poem, which is
brief enough to quote here in full. Its title is "This Be The Verse":

They fuck you up, your mum and dad.
They may not mean to, but they do.
They fill you with the faults they had
And add some extra, just for you.

But they were fucked up in their turn
By fools in old-style hats and coats,
Who half the time were sloppy-stern
And half at one another's throats.

Man hands on misery to man.
It deepens like a coastal shelf.
Get out as early as you can,
And don't have any kids yourself.



You can find this in Larkin's Collected Poems or in High Windows.

Hi -- although I'm not sure it is to whom I am responding...

But I just read this article, and will quote the last three paragraphs for
those who won't go to the page.  This ending follows a well-written
description of the recent pier collapse and thought-provoking speculations
about negligence by owners and L&I.  (Further thoughs below...)

                  Meanwhile, I'm thinking about this
                  lemming-like mentality among Americans
                  preferring nightclubs to poetry. What if crowds
                  flocked to poetry readings instead of
                  nightclubs? But how can poetry compete with
                  piers falling into the river? It can't. Although
                  Emily Dickinson said poetry is when you feel
                  like the top of your head is about to blow off.
                  And Ezra Pound said poets are the antennae of
                  the race. And someone else said to be a poet
                  means to go through life with one less skin.

                  The big coincidence? Before he started reading
                  his poetry in that church basement the night the
                  pier fell into the river, Aaren Yeatts Perry, the
                  poet, educator and human-rights activist,
                  reminisced how far back we go. "Remember that
                  time we were in your living room on
                  Rittenhouse Square around 1984, putting
                  together the pages of that literary magazine
                  called Heat?"

                  Heat and Club Heat. Get it? Synchronicity. It
                  gives me chills just NOT thinking about it. I
                  don't know what it means. Maybe that poetry
                  makes connections between unlikely things.
                  Check it out sometime. It sure beats the
                  alternative. And that's as much as I know right
                  now.


I also want to quote, this from an essay/talk Jack Spicer (thanks M) gave
in 1949, the first time he publicly asked the question, "Why is nobody
here? Who is listening to us?"

(after starting out with the common complaint of unintelligibility...)

"What this audience [read: the Club Heat audience] has found is not the
intelligibility that it had modestly asked for, but that greater boon that
it did not dare to ask -- entertainment... The truth is that pure poetry
bores everybody.  It is even a bore to the poet... Live poetry is a kind
of singing.  It differs from prose, as song does, in its complexity of
stress and intonation... Today we are not singers.  We would rather
publish poetry in a little magazine than read it in a large hall.  If we
do read in a hall, we do not take the most elementary steps to make our
poetry vivid and entertaining.  We are not singers.  We do not use our
bodies.  We *recite* from a printed page."

People go to nightclubs to meet/interact with other people and to lose
themselves in (thus re-encountering) the experience of their bodies.
Your average poetry reading is stiff as a corpse in comparison.  If
our antennae are so great, why can't we pick up on the most basic of human
needs?  Our lives are being taken over by the written word:  who needs
more of it?  (Emily Dickinson didn't spend so much time on the e-mail.)
(And I include "recitations" among the written word.)

I don't want to dismiss Ms. Polak's very good questions or her suggestion
to check it [poetry] out sometime.  All very good.  (And I wasn't at the
poetry reading on May 18th that she mentions.)

I just want to say, in response to a lacking audience for poetry:  I'm
bored, too.  I've spent my entire adult life encouraging people to "check
it out," but I'm beginning to question what I've been saying with such a
blind faith.  I myself see that there is a poetry reading, and though I
may have spent all day reading poetry, more times than not I think, "Geez,
I can't sit through this tonight.  I'd rather eat dinner with Mike."  I,
too, need a return to my body which poetry is increasingly unable to
provide.  (Please, please, note your exceptions and support them.)

Jack didn't figure it out, either, the audience question.  His last poem
addresses itself to Ginsberg:  "I don't see how you do it.  One hundred
thousand university students marching with you.  Toward / A necessity
which is not love but is a name."  We don't really want the lemming-like
crowds, do we?  We want individuals to lose the crowd and realize their
own humanity.  We won't do this by suggesting other heros, new names, new
cliffs to throw themselves from.  We might do this by losing the little
lemming inside of each of us, vigilantly losing it, pervasively, in every
aspect of our life and art.  And by continuing to love poetry, to read,
write, and live poetically -- instead of worrying about what audience is
there to recognize, and name, Poetry and Poets. (We might even notice more
people around us if we quit making them into such an Audience.)

Love -- and poetry -- is that which will not name itself.

Naively yours,
Shawn

or, for that matter, a clockwork orange involves a dysfunctional family,
take yer pick, film or book.  the film, unlike the book, provides no answer,
no solution (and seems more believable).

I agree that poets need support, but do not you think this is just a bit
unsympathetic?  not everybody has an extra dollar, or can afford $7, no
matter how much they would like to attend.  some people are so poor it is
hard to imagine how poor that is if you are not nearly so poor.  poets can
use fiscal support perhaps, but some poets cannot afford to provide such
support, even if it is (only?--a relative term) $7.

no one ever said no fees should be charged.  someone suggested that people
relax those fees for those who sincerely cannot pay it.

my suggestion is that in general such fees be reduced (eliminated?) and
replaced with the request of donations.  if you are the poet and you need to
be reimbursed by your audience, why not just ask the people for the money
directly, personally, after the performance, or better, before the
performance?  especially if there are travel fees and the like.  ask for a
donation.   don't have the door people do all the 'dirty' work.  solicit
donations before the performance, etc.

what happens when there's a door fee for a reading anyway?
well, let me think for a minute here--
i know it varies, depending on the situation,
but maybe, just maybe...
some possibilities:
maybe the reading poet(s) might get paid.
maybe the reading poet(s) might get paid enough to cover their travel
expenses, shd they have any.
maybe the place holding the event gets some money for rent, going to things
such as facilities/equipment maintenance, upgrades to facilities/equipment,
payment to maintenance personnel, compliance w/ever-changing bldg codes,
etc...going to the continuation of the venue's viability as site for future
readings.
maybe the person/foundation/individual organizing the event gets some money
to pay for publicity, postage, paper to print on, a desk in an office, a
chair, a lightbulb, etc.
maybe the person/foundation/individual organizing the event gets some money
to pay for future events, or for programs that don't receive funds, or to
pay
off bills incurred from another reading not so well attended.
maybe the person/foundation/individual organizing the event might pay
someone
a little bit for time spent putting together events. it might buy that
person
meals, pay rent...you know, the things a job, a paycheck can do for a
person.
so maybe $7 for a reading isn't so much after all.
or maybe $7 is a lot for a reading, but it's better than having no readings
at all.
if people stay outside, refuse to participate--your venues dry up.
don't go to readings? no readings. don't buy books? no books.

This message seems to be anonymous, so I don't know the source of the
writer's grievance. But as the organizer of an upcoming conference, I'd
like to say a word or two in response to this message.  One form that
paranoia takes in America is the assumption that other people are
"getting away with" something, reaping some sort of benefits that are
unjustly denied to others.  So I thought the members of this list might
like to know a little more about conferences--how they are funded, and
what makes them possible.

Yes, we are asking the panelists at the forthcoming National Poetry
Foundation conference ("The Opening of the Field: North American Poetry
in the 1960s") to pay a registration fee.  If we waived the fee for all
panelists, we'd receive virtually no income from the conference
whatsoever, in that at least 80% of the people who come to such
conferences are on the program.  And if we didn't receive some income
from the conference, we couldn't put it on.  We ran deficits of $5,000
on each of the last two NPF conferences, even with the registration
fee.  This year we're hoping to break even, but will probably end with
another (smaller) deficit. Where does the money go?  Primarily, the
University of Maine itself charges NPF a fee for the use of the
campus--even though NPF is a part of the university. (If we moved the
conference to hotels, the cost would soar. We've been able to keep
costs at NPF conference relatively low, as compared with several other
conferences I've attended, by running them during the summer on the
campus.) And we provide help on travel costs for featured speakers,
although we don't come near to covering their full expenses.  In
addition, we have hundreds of miscellaneous expenses--van service for
participants, printing costs, advertising and promotion, etc.

So: it costs us money to run these conferences.  And in addition, the
staff of NPF has, by the time the conference is over, contributed
hundreds of hours of their time to making the conference happen. This
time isn't exactly uncompensated--we're on the university payroll. But
much of it is in fact overload time--I've been spending an average of
at least ten hours a week over the last year working on this
conference, as part of my 60 or 70 hour work-week, which has included
teaching my normal load of classes, trying to keep up with my editing
responsibilities with NPF, and various other administrative
responsibilities.  I and others here at NPF have contributed our time,
not  because we see an opportunity to profit from the naive, or because
we "have to" under the terms of our employment.  We do it because we
want to create a space where people who care about poetry can come
together face to face (electronic communication DOES have its
limitations) to share their passion.

Conferences like ours are made possible by the fact that people with
connections at universities can usually get at least partial support
from their home institutions to cover travel costs and registration
fees. Yes, this means that people without such connections must wing it
on their own.  I'm sorry about that fact--and our anonynmous
complainant is correct when he suggests that this system tends to
separate the academic world from those outside that world. In another
time or place, maybe the government could fund such events, and make
them free to all.  I've applied three times for funding from NEH to
support NPF conferences (at the cost of upwards of 100 hours of my
time, to prepare the proposal), and have been turned down every time.
The people on the NEH review panels have, its seems, never heard of, or
are actively hostile to, the poets we're interested in.

So our correspondent wants to see all such conferences "destroyed."  I
must admit that I feel personally attacked here. Yes, there are
problems in the system.  But is simply destroying what we've got, with
all its limitations, the way to solve these problems?

What do you mean by "subattitudes"?  As a reader of Bernstein's work, I'd
say that his overt attitude towards Romanticism, per se, has been much more
complex than any wholesale pro- or con-

In particular [on the Blake tip], see
http://www.thing.net/~sabina/valentine/bernstein.html

I can't speak to the libretto, not having seen / heard it, but I suspect
there's much happening there with persona, and thus it'd be a slippery
slope to evaluate the author's attitude toward Romanticism (which carries
multiple and really very complex strictures vis-a-vis "authenticity" or
"sincerity") from that.

        We ought to be careful, I think, not to misjudge a complex engagement with
something as a complete disengagement.

Announcing them & calls for papers/presentations on list helps -- I have been to
a few wonderful local conferences (just listening, not even eating very much
cheese) because of this -- thanks, thanks.

Knowing that you have to pay your way if your paper is accepted is an important
piece of knowledge I only relatively recently learned -- it's all paid for in
many other industries -- and the higher ed industry doesn't make much use of
video conferencing or broadcast yet.

P.S., MLA has an independent scholar prize, but I think you need to publish a
critical work with a major press to win.

sometimes i write like a child with tension just beneath the surface
i will write complexly simultaneously defending and revealing the face
sometimes i save each and every keystroke and return them as text
sometimes i check the content of my text for spelling
i will automate myself on irc and look at the mirrors of everyone else
sometimes i check for diction and statistics of styles
once in a while i will set all caps or small letters
i will use a program called julu to help me when i'm at a loss
i will use programs with the display function to fill things out
sometimes i will rake my older texts with grep looking for lines
sometimes i will use sed for complex and continuous substitutions
once in a while i will build upon layers of substitutions
once in a while i will use programs such as hangman for content
sometimes i will use eliza for psychoanalytical interaction
once in a while i will use my own derivative for sexual psychoanalytics
every so often i will use old computer-card reproduction programs
the text-based game adventure lends itself towards performativity analysis
i will enter talkers alone or with avatars for metaphysical studies
i will use the review command or archie or gopher for archaeologies
i will build simple objects in moos confusing object numbers and names
sometimes i will use ytalk for reproduction of body image in textual form
html and dhtml give me the opportunity for text and image based html-body
javascript lures and seduces the viewer into psycho-liminal content
images present the edges of things as if they were interiors
i will use qbasic programs to examine the contours of measuring
i will use gimp or photoshop to reveal the internal tissues of the world
i will use shell scripts to reorganize texts into new revelations of shame
i will speak through programs begging for questions and answers
i will play textual games if they reveal whatever is left of truth
i will reprogram a mud to reveal the mad interiors of speech and phenomena
sometimes i will create disturbances on email lists or newsgroups

sometimes i see my face embedded in the face of the other; it is like a
plaque or medallion embedded in the face of the other or like a cartouche
bringing to mind discrepancies; it is like an emulsion half-developed or
it is like the breakdown of any conceivable methodologies; or like a decay
or dissolution of applications and results; a disturbance which refuses to
resolve; a constant reminder; the forgetting of a name passing in the form
of a body; something else, i can barely remember, on the tip of my tongue,
something of lips

Dear all,

        The publication I co-edit, the Harvard Review of Philosophy, is
coming out in around a month (if we're lucky.) As with last year, we'll
probably have a good amount of "overflow," once we send to subscribers and
bookstores, and so anyone who would like a free copy should e-mail me
(backchannel) their snail mail address. I did this last year, and there
was a good amount of response; people, please don't forget to send your
address!

        Last year, we had a long poem by Jan Zwicky; this year, we were
trying to get Anne Carson, but to no avail, and so there's no poetry, only
prose and two interviews, one with Alexander Nehemas, and one I did with
Cora Diamond. Those with money to spare are encouraged to subscribe, or to
encourage their local University libraries to subscribe ($6 individual,
$10 institution.) If you pay an extra $10, I and the rest of the staff
will sign the issue with a big felt tip marker.

        We're also always looking for submissions, most often in
essay/academic form; I confess that the mainstream philosophy community is
failing somewhat to represent in the field of aesthetics, so if any
critics on the list are interested in writing, please get in touch.

I received the following SPOON Announcement, which some of you may be interested
in.

---------- Forwarded message ----------
-0700 (PDT) From: ecampeau@nupedia.com To:
owner-postcolonial@lists.village.virginia.edu Subject: Seeking
Contributors For Open Content Encyclopedia

====================================

A major new encyclopedia project, Nupedia.com, is looking for informed
and enthusiastic people to help direct and construct an "open content"
encyclopedia, planned to become the largest general encyclopedia in
history.  Articles will be peer-reviewed and carefully copyedited by
means of a growing network of mailing lists.  The project has
significant financial support, and its leaders and owners are committed
to a years-long, intensive effort.  Among the project's leaders, the
excitement level is high.

In constructing this encyclopedia, we intend use the special
opportunities of the internet and hyperlinks to include articles written
at varying levels of generality and specialization.  (Programmers may be
interested to know that the articles will be encoded in XML format.)

We are in need of well-qualified writers, editors, and peer reviewers in
all areas, and will be doing searches for subject area editors.  At
present, we have about three dozen Ph.D.'s, M.D.'s, and other
highly-trained professionals who have generously volunteered their time
as Nupedia editors and peer reviewers.  Most of these people are also
advisory board members who help shape Nupedia policy and procedure.  We
are all committed to creating an open, public, academically-respectable
institution.

What does it mean to say the encyclopedia is "open content"?
This means that anyone can use content taken from Nupedia
articles for almost any purpose, both for-profit or non-profit,
so long as Nupedia is credited as the source and so long as the
distributor of the information does not attempt to restrict
others from distributing the same information.  Nupedia will be
"open content" in the same way that Linux and the Open Directory
Project (dmoz.com) are "open source."  As has been the case with
those projects, we plan to attract a huge body of talented
contributors.

Indeed, since making our initial press release in March, over 1500
people from around the world have signed up as Nupedia members.

Because Nupedia will be open content, it will be in a
freely-distributable public resource created by an international
public effort.  It is not an exaggeration to say that your
contributions would help to provide an international public a
free education.  We believe Nupedia is, thus, a project worthy
of your attention.

If you want to join us or stay apprised of the progress of Nupedia,
please take a minute to go to the Nupedia website at
http://www.nupedia.com/ and become a member.  (Becoming a member is
quick, easy, and free.)  Please consult
http://www.nupedia.com/steering.html for details about steering
committee positions and consult http://www.nupedia.com/policy.html for a
draft statement of Nupedia editorial policy.

Best regards,
Larry Sanger, Ph.D. expected May 2000 Philosophy, Ohio State
Editor-in-Chief, Nupedia.com
San Diego, California

P.S. If you wish to help promote this project -- something we
would greatly appreciate -- please do forward this announcement
to any *appropriate* forums and to colleagues you think may be
interested (including your local/departmental mailing lists and
newsgroups).  Or, if you would rather that Nupedia make the
announcement on a forum you frequent, please just give us a
pointer to the forum and we can take it from there.

further on my work -


my work is not about avatars; it is not about jennifer, julu, nikuko. my
work is not about sex or sexual objects. my writing floats through beings
and sexualities, floats through different worlds with different physics,
different neurophysiologies. my work is about the interrelationships among
the symbols employed to comprehend, elucidate, live within, the world -
and the consciousness which receives, transmits, and is constituted to
some degree by such symbols. my work exists between the symbolic and the
imaginary/fantasmic/uncanny - on one hand, protocols, etiquette, and pro-
priety - and on the other, those very openings occasioned by avatars, sex-
ualities, issues of dreamed bodies and bodies dreaming, trance-states,
virtual subjectivities, electronic existences.

(the work is not pornography, titillation, stories, parables; it is not a
narrative of avatars or epistolary novel; neither of course is it what i
say it is, or is not.)

i am writing this in response to someone's kind backchannel response con-
cerning my last textual posting - that it is difficult to pin down what
these texts are, from what occasions they emerge, towards what horizons
they move, however haltingly.

consciousness moves, trembling, against great forces and happenstance; the
asteroid, cancer, death, takes it all out. we exist and write/create with-
in the meantime, meanwhile. and within this interstice, we inhabit phenom-
enologies as if there were futures, eternities, truths. i write towards
and against these futures, eternities, truths; i write as if there were no
tomorrow, or as if we were always already inhabiting tomorrow as fantasm.

i want to move towards and across, beyond the other, as if the other were
a lure or possibility. i want to write into the void, where texts and
images fall into space emptied of everything, including purity. and I want
to see what happens in these non-domains; what types of perception and
consciousnesses are possible; what the limits of the human, the animal,
the organism, are; what may be said about the future of philosophy and the
philosophy of the future - the textual body and the body of text - the
state of the chiasm and partial objects, interpenetrations; what can be
created when language is reconstituted, transformed, beneath the signi-
fiers of technology, sexuality, capital, and so forth. i want to move into
spaces that dis/comfort or exhilarate me, spaces that keep the sense of
wonder alive, space that - at least for me - are new, and always beyond
what i am able to accomplish. i want to see vistas, be vistas, see ...

towards these ends i write daily into areas that both carry my signature
and abandon it. i want to abandon, as much as possible, the foreclosure of
ideological theorizing or a tendency towards the specificity of style or
genre; what i want to do, i can't possibly accomplish, i keep writing ...

Mime-Version: 1.0

Ramez,

I attended Bernstein’s performance at the Poetry Project, and rather than
look at it as Romantic affect for effect or a simple turnabout to a more
traditional approach to poetic content and form, I see it, in many ways, as
a paradoxical enactment of Bernstein’s long-standing project of shuffling
and disprupting genre and the reader’s or listener’s expectations. As you
noted, the main piece from which Bernstein read was a libretto. By
performing this piece in the venerable Poetry Project, Bernstein necessarily
called into question assumptions concerning the boundaries of poetry and
music, spoken word and song. Though the performance had fewer surface
disruptions than his readers might expect (though it was not without
these—which occurred in the sometimes farcical voicings of characters, the
explosively Dadist poem for Jandl, and the call-and-response piece ("What
time is it now?") with looped recording of the automated voice saying the
time), on a conceptual level, it was similar to his genre-bending a-poetic
poems and his poem essays. Bernstein brought "opera" from the concert hall
to the Poetry Project, and I think the metaphysical and poetic nature of the
writing itself might obscure this gesture—and make it seem like merely a new
(for him) poetic style. Even if it were merely that (and who knows, except
maybe the poet himself), I still think the gesture was strikingly bold, and
radical if viewed within the very context you mentioned—Bernstein’s
long-standing antithesis to traditional, Romantic verse. Clearly, if
Berstein hadn’t upended your (and my) expectations of what his poetics
entailed, we wouldn’t be writing about it—but would have seen one more
disjunctive reading by a Language poet. At this point, I would contend,
Language-inflected styles of radical parataxis, deliberate flatness (or
edginess), the appropriation of multiple, disparate styles, and the violent
refusal of closure are as codified—and expected—as any tropes or gestures of
Romanticism or the late American I-epiphany in nature, memory, or the
garage. So, for Bernstein to perform a piece that intensively investigates
traditional "poetic" issues of time, loss, and mortality is to take a major
risk—and cut against what most people, and particulary his admirers, expect
from him. I very much respected the risk-taking element of this performance,
though I suspect that I would be less interested in talking about it if it
hadn’t been so disarmingly powerful and moving. It wasn’t what I expected,
but I was very pleased to hear it. So, while I think the performance was
disruptive of expectations of genre and Bernstein’s poetics—these issues are
secondary to the power of the performance. Ultimately, I don’t care if what
anyone performs in 2000 corresponds with his or her writings of 1979, 1990
or 1999. Who wants any poet to stop taking chances? To end with a cliché
(via Emerson): Consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds.

Dear 23 list members in England and environs:

From Sept. 10 to Dec. 20 of this fall, I will be leading the University of
Hawai'i's Study Abroad program in English to the global city of London to
teach two smallish seminars at Thames Valley University:  one on the
postcolonial literatures of contemporary UK and the rise of cultural
studies work like ''ain't no black in the union jack'' and Stuart Hall's
global/local dialectics to deal with this multicultural and postcolonial
transformation of UK cultural poetics; and another on American writers in
London and Paris (like Stein, Jack London, and Hemingway and the nasty
travelogue-maker, Paul Theroux) and their ongoing romance/representations
of these cities (with site-specific treks built into both courses).

My wife, Mari, and I are looking to rent a one to two bedroom flat in some
area of London for this time frame that is (A) close to Ealing or Notting
Hill; or (B) near a subway line closer to downtown London or a suburb that
would make the twice-a-week commute to class do-able.

If anybody on the list would like to arrange an equitable exchange with us
for our 2 bedroom condo with huge swimming pools, racquet ball courts,
weight room, car etc. in the Hawaii Kai suburb of Honolulu, that would be
very possible too.

So if you are interested in this, please let me know with some specifics
via email or give me a call to Hawai'i at (808) 9563050 [o]/3964153 [h].

Somebody told me Homi Bhabha has a lovely flat in London, but I am not
sure I can afford it or am postcolonial enough in that regard. But who
knows.. Regards, Rob Wilson

One of the funniest passages in modern poetry is in Thomas McGrath's
_Letter to an Imaginary Friend_, where he's rooming with "the family
Peets" and going to LSU.  He's a border, an outsider, more or less,
viewing a highly fucked-up family. The passage lasts about a page and a
half, is somewhere in part I or II, and is a great portrayal of serious
dysfunction with a comic edge.

David

I prefer to see politics as one strand,  a single pole
in poetics, rather than as the whole shebang. Saying
all poetics is politics is as irrelevent as saying all
politics is poetics. As for $$$, I would just like to
know whose in it for the money, anyway? Even the dozen
or so in North America who live on the money they make
from poetry don't make what they are worth. My poetry
is so valuable that, if people had to pay for it, no
one could afford it. "No poetry friends just biz"? My
poet friends are all as broke as I am.

    The point is, there are poets in every school and genre whose work is no=

    For example, at the faculty reading some of Susan's translations were of=

whom I was trying to persuade that poetry is capable of building community,=20
of being exchanged and viewed as products of fine art, of being inhabited as=

poetry for them; that we should go out with our green spiral notebooks and=20
read the first thing we whipped off on the pot during the car adds between=20
game shows.  He's saying, partly, that if your poem lacks one of those=20
elements, the craft goes lacking.  And yes the audience will disappear.

Does anyone know what the origin of Derrida's expression
'toujours deja' ('always already') is?  According to a couple of
French-speakers I've asked, it doesn't sound idiomatic, and
it isn't in my Larousse Lexis.  I've just seen a quote from
Heidegger, in English, that leads me to conjecture that
Derrida took it from him, perhaps (mis)translating
'schon immer', but I haven't got the Heidegger text in
German (Wegmarken, 2nd ed., p. 419: "Thinking and
poeticizing must in a certain way go back to where they
have always already been...").

Assuming that it isn't just a magisterial, sui generis
coinage...

Thanks.

Clemente's Images
by Robert Creeley
Backwoods Broadsides Chaplet Series, #50
Ellsworth, ME
cost: $1.00

"Clemente's Images" is a Robert Creeley study in rhyme: near-rhymes,
repetition rhymes, semantic rhymes, antonym rhymes, synonym rhymes,
consonance rhymes and traditional rhymes. The 25 poems, each consisting of
three couplets, refer to works by Francesco Clemente which appeared in a
recent New York retrospective at the Guggenheim Museum. Although there is
undoubtedly a great deal to say about the relationship between Creeley's
poems and Clemente's images, I am going to concentrate here on the poems
themselves, and one formal instance of them, at that.

In Poem 14, Creeley sandwiches a full rhyme between two near-rhymes. Here is
the poem in its entirety:

He is safely put
in a container, head to foot

and there, on his upper part, wears still
remnants of a life he lived at will--

but, lower down, he probes at that doubled sack
holds all his random virtues in a mindless fact.

If we were to take "in a container" out of the first couplet, we are left
with a series of trochees which reads somewhere between an elegy and a
nursery rhyme. The near-rhyme between "put" and "foot," of course, calls
attention to both words and gives the reader an opportunity to ask questions
about that slanted relationship. What I first notice is a certain
forcedness. We normally say "head to feet" when describing something in its
totality. But, Creeley, is calling for us to look at this awkwardness in the
rhyme. Some thing, or something, cannot be easily placed in a container,
despite the fact that when the previously excluded prepositional phrase is
added back to the couplet, we have the cadences of everyday speech. With
"head to foot" (the sign of some attempt at totality) excluded, another,
another incongruence begins to appear between the casualness of the syntax
and the content of the short sentence. It is not a thing being put into a
container, but a man. And when "head to foot" is returned to the foot of the
couplet, I cannot help but think of standing at the foot of a coffin.

But there is yet another twist. With the return of totality to the couplet,
there is the macabre sense of the body being in parts, with the head next to
the foot. There are other suggestions as well. A new body (the "he") is
placed head to the foot of another body in a mass grave or the speaker of
this unheroic couplet is describing an action that he has taken, or
witnessed.

The sense of division continues in the second couplet which focuses on the
"upper part" of the man. This half of a man, now an empty container, wears
"remnants" of his life upon his chest. Presumably, these are military
ribbons. Although I have not seen the Guggenheim retrospective, I am
familiar enough with Clemente's work to know that he has painted a number of
portraits of dictators with chestfuls of medals which they wear at their own
will and which they use to display a terrible iron will. Now, they are the
will of a man who fractured and broke others and who has only become a still
oneness at his death. But what appears in the rhyming of "still" and "will"
as some sense of closure is, in fact, belied by the simple em-dash which
extends the second line and disrupts ever so slightly the full rhyme in
sound, suggesting that what we hear and see are not the same.

The third couplet moves to the lower part of the man, the site at which
there are no longer parts, but a doubling. We are now where Blake has
been -- showing us how the repression of sexuality extends beyond the body
of the one repressed to the body politic whose members are probed, crushed,
maimed, killed and tortured in the name of purity and virtue. The near-rhyme
of "doubled sack" (the rhyming words must also be doubled here) and
"mindless fact" is an immensely powerful evocation of these horrors.

Each of the other 24 poems in this chaplet is equally masterful in their use
of various rhyming practices. As just one more example, consider the last
words of Poem 23's couplets: like/time, mind/found, and alone/one. These six
words alone form an intriguing shell.

speaking of movies, I just saw The Virgin Suicides, which though flawed
structurally and having a bit of 'blame it all on the bitch mother' kind of
thing, does raise a lot of good issues, among them, how lame are the cliches
being offered to high school students by their youth-nostalgic parents.  I
mean, how could anyone take a star-studded, sequined-decorated gymnasium
homecoming dance seriously after the release of the movie Carrie?

Before the discussion and expose on mr. nudel ensued, i'd started on
this poem, spurred by the qupotation that begins it. not that the poems
is about him, but that it served as a spark. i tend to write by building
energy from observations and relfections, then need some phrase or
experience (be it quote, song, bumpersticker, movie, etc) to set loose
the flow.

every action requires a reaction,20
to reach a new state, to redefine the borders and laws existing in the
realm i pass through20
daily / nightly/ as the urge weaves
catching the bus using quantum routes97
it will be at one of six streets sometime during the hour,20
(and if you find the bus you probably don92t know where its going)

like biting into an electron without knowing what element its dependent
on, orbiting the center20
that died 2000 years ago, as if gravity left in 1492 and we havent
realized it yet, in 1776, 1984
the meter is built by a mind who knows what it wants to meter

i packed up my bags
i went looking for a place to hide, a way to connect, a hide to pull in
hundreds of channels, forgotten rituals20
from isolated villages who worshipped icons made of rotted wood, who
grew termites as pets20
to create icons and provide the nitrogen rich pulp theyd slather over
their naked bodies during hot summer sun


coming from a hundred years in the past to find the family farm paved
over with an abandoned mall
going two hundred years in the past and finding you know nothing of
value, cant recreate any future products or remember enough particular
history, maybe win some bets on presidential election, assuming survival
& freedom
with strange clothes and no money, with a disproportionate body and a
funny way of talking

a body with how many channels, each possible acupuncture point a
broadcasting tower, a kilobyte of memory unskeining from the portion
your burger simulates, protein pounded wafer thin, cow chip technology
transformed by the esters in overheated rancid oil from we92re not sure
what source,20
something hyperdrogenated or if you cant eat it you can wax your walls

everything that gets old must be reinvented, reengineered, rediscovered,
reexamined into something it wasn92t, missing what weve never tasted,
remembering what has never been
til we can teach dna to lie97we92ve already learned to confuse it, or
to be fooled by its seeming innocence20
in fitting in, as if its not already making plans for transformation
strawberry fish, peanut tomatoes, rockets powered by soybeans


we92re are looking at the possibility of mass transit as a destination,
the wildlife on the subways, the chance to hunt fugitives who we pay to
ride the rails across town, rehabilitating targets bringing you 21st
century catharsis
at Disney92s Inner City Experience97role with the dice and you wont
crap out, its all natural
but contained, time release heroin slows the targets down, hiring the
people who could never work20
at the other parks-- not squeaky enough, stray hairs, random piercings,
ask too many question,
don92t want to flip burgers--with a side contract to mental health
agencies for placing paranoids20
somewhere theyre right97the tourists ARE out to get them

it92s a question of how much you can melt away and still be human, here
in post cultural Americo,
the rich are used to inter breeding, swallowing the occasional sport, at
least with the rich in charge20
we won92t lose fucking, fucking dominance, the FDA, the IMF,20
get along little netheads, bait for the masters,, corroding our own back
yards,20
our houses compost faster than our bread,



we could connect by being smaller and faster, less in the body, more on
the unmetered waves, so much clarity passing through a non existent
conduit-- turn left just before you black out, like a prayer you can
utter20
a millisecond before the artery bursts, that jump in a crashing plane,
the fearlessness20
of being shocked out of your body into your self: growth is in the
rebound,20
then discussing denying folding back in and leaving alone
the time waiting has bits of song and dance, experiments in conjuring
food from intentions, visualizing20
what the body is hungry for, accepting bad luck as the result of
something someyou once did:
take the guilt and pass it through, take the black and filter to gray,20
letting go all you can so92s to sprout antennae and alleys, encouraging
erosion and wind,20
the circulation of the seemingly solid, the circulastory system,
beginnings of sections:
fast fuel, slow burn, chocolate creating its own neurons, cannibalizing
cannibinol,20
we are when we eat, eating like a leaf, like a bed sheet left to dry in
the jungle,20
compost at the north pole, barcoded cockroaches emitting cookies when
theyre found and scanned
we know so much we need to sell, can crate so many scenarios, crate the
vacuum
just before the product appears, like the minutes of burning desert in
Lawrence of Arabia
just before the intermission sends stampedes to the fountains and soda
counters


but what can you give us
that92s worth what we92ve already taken from you
