 *PRESS RELEASE & ANNOUNCEMENT: "POETS ON ADOPTION"*
*[Please feel free to forward]*
For more info: GalateaTen@aol.com


*POETS ON ADOPTION*

Poetry: it inevitably relates to -- among others -- identity, history,
culture, class, race, community, economics, politics, power, loss, health,
desire, regret, language, form and genre disruption, love ... as well as the
absences thereofs.

The same may be said about Adoption.

You are invited to visit POETS ON ADOPTION (
http://poetsonadoption.blogspot.com) to see how poets with adoption
experiences mine the intersections of poetry and adoption.  Their varied
experiences, meditations and poems powerfully bring forth an *urgent* poetics
in an educational context.

POETS ON ADOPTION will be updated over time as more poets send in their
contributions.  You are invited to peruse and spread the word about the
blog's Call for Participation at
http://poetsonadoption.blogspot.com/2011/03/call-for-participation.html .

The inaugural issue presents the following poets below on adoption. We hope
this site engages you, and welcome your comments,

 Eileen R. Tabios

It seems that any real consideration of the value of the poet/poetry is nul=
lified=2C in an oddly paradoxical way=2C by the prices of each garment list=
ed glaringly under each image. These prices seem to get in the way of the c=
elebratory=2C whimsical image being attempted by the photographers=2C desig=
ners=2C and editors. I wonder why the editors of O thought it was necessary=
 to list these. Don't they know poets don't make any money? It's almost tau=
nting=2C in that way. It's an odd convention in the fashion world anyways=
=2C no? And what does this convention tell us about how that world operates=
?=20
In that issue of O=2C the editors and writers do seem to be looking at poet=
ry as a therapeutic enterprise=2C as something that requires inspiration to=
 do. It seems=2C Mairead=2C that they're taking it more seriously than Joel=
 might be=2C although their purported goal is celebration. It's natural=2C =
in any case=2C for those who operate in a field to want to protect it and p=
reserve it. This does seem a bit of a pop culture intrusion into a field th=
at gains its vitality from its otherness=2C for better or for worse.

By the way, the Sonia Delaunay exhibit currently at the Cooper Hewitt I fou=
nd to be fantastic. Her pattern books for fashion can be read as straight u=
p(and horizontal) constructivist. She also collaborated - in the exhibit -=
=A0 with Blaise Cendrar on the famous flattened scroll poem, Transberrian E=
xpress (not accurate title).
To expand the pleasure and contrast go to the Madison St. Gagosian exhibit =
of 6 great Malevich paintings - Delaunay and M are clearly kissing Russian =
aesthetic Revolutionary cousins. They are both up beat w/ the spirit and ho=
pes of that time.=A0 The Americans who were influenced by Malevich at the G=
agosian (& why not Delaunay, too, Mr. Gagosian?) are, no matter how great, =
in many respects are kind of a dour postwar bunch.=A0=20

Jay Millar=A1=AFs BOOKTHUG has just published my visual poem Prose of the
Trans-Canada:

In 1913 Blaise Cendrars created his monumental Prose of the  Trans-Siberian=
,
a milestone in the history of artists books and visual  poetry. When the
intended edition of 150 copies was laid end-to-end they  measured the same
length as the height of the symbol of Parisian  Modernity, the Eiffel Tower=
.
Prose of the Trans-Canada responds to  Cendrars=A1=AF legacy in a 16=A1=C8 x 52=A1=C8
visual poem. When all 150 copies of this  limited edition are placed
end-to-end, the resultant length is the same  as the symbol of Calgarian
Modernity, the Calgary Tower.

=A1=B0A towering moment in beaulieu=A1=AFs on-going exploration of letraset as a
medium for concrete poetry, Prose of the Trans-Canada, issued as Moments
Cafe No. 8, is published in a strictly limited edition of 150 copies printe=
d
on matte polypro film and available for order here:

http://bookthug.ca/proddetail.php?prod=3D201114

Check Bridge Street Books. Ask for Rod Smith. Or get Buck Downs on facebook. He runs the Big Bear reading. Also, go to the Busboy and Poets page, or look for Holly Bass on facebook. & another: The Library of Congress has an excellent noon poetry series, and one doesn't have to be a poet Laureate to read there. Hell, I've read there and have had friends who have read there. But overall, the Bridge Street Books bookstore reading is by far the best. Recently, Cole Swenson and Charles Bernstein have read there. & of course, Rod Smith.

Hi,

Is anybody running a reading series in the D.C. area? or have any contacts
with folks who are?

In May I'll be reading in Boston with Bill Corbett and then at the Poetry
Project in nyc and will be continuing down to D.C. to check out the Philip
Guston exhibit ROMA up at the Phillips Collection.

Guston is a central part of my first book recently published by Post Apollo:
http://www.postapollopress.com/GUSTONBOOK.html

I'd love to do a reading in the D.C. area while I'm there but haven't been
able to make contact with anybody down there. Any assistance is appreciated.
Please backchannel.

Cheers!

Patrick

 9, 2011=0A=0A=0A=0A=0AWhat looked like a literary prank - a cardboard cuto=
ut of Langston Hughes snatched from Busboys & Poets last week - has turned =
into full-blown debate about the D.C. poetry scene.=0A=0A=0A=0A"I took it,"=
 Thomas Sayers Ellis told us Tuesday. The=0AWashington native, poet and ass=
istant professor of creative writing at=0ASarah Lawrence College said he gr=
abbed the life-size cutout of Hughes=0Aas a protest - because he doesn't th=
ink that the restaurant/performance=0Aspace pays poets fairly for their pub=
lic readings.=0A=0A"You would think that an establishment that makes as muc=
h money as=0ABusboys would have set in place a reading series with a respec=
tful pay=0Ascale for writers," Ellis said. The restaurant gives poets a ven=
ue, but=0Ait also profits from their talent. The literary community, he sai=
d,=0Adoesn't know if Busboys is the "good guys or the bad guys."=0A=0A=0ACo=
uld be that the restaurant is a victim of its own success: It's a commercia=
l enterprise and=0Aa hangout for writers. The rookies are happy to appear a=
t all, while=0Asome of the bigger names (who command large appearance fees =
from=0Alibraries and universities) believe they should share in the wealth.=
=0A=0A=0AOwner Andy Shallal told us he pays a monthly salary for=0Athree po=
ets-in-residence (one at each of the restaurant's locations) as=0Awell as $=
50 each to a host and featured poet at three weekly readings.=0A"We have re=
gular gathering with poets and writers to discuss how we can=0Abecome more =
supportive of their craft," he said. "I think we've done a=0Alot to enhance=
 the poetry community in this city."=0A=0A=0A"I have no issue with Andy mak=
ing money," said poet Kyle Dargan,=0Aan assistant professor of literature a=
t American University. There's=0Abeen "some grumbling" among D.C. poets abo=
ut the $50 payments:=0A"Peanuts," he said, compared to Shallal's revenue fr=
om the weekly=0Areadings. While he doesn't condone the theft of Flat Langst=

cutout? Ellis told us he knows its=0Awhereabouts - but he isn't telling. So=
me critics (including Ellis)=0Aweren't happy about the image of Hughes as b=
usboy and thought Shallal=0Ashould have picked a more distinguished photo.=
=0A=0AShallal disagreed: "We have exposed Langston's poetry to thousands=0A=
of people - his birthday is celebrated with the greatest of honor and=0Afan=
fare." He said Ellis has never approached him with any complaints,=0Aand, i=
n any event, it's a poor excuse to steal the cutout.=0A=0A=0AAnd yes - if i=

--------------------------------------------


June 2008: Refocussed List Policy
In line with our editorial focus, we do not automatically post
submissions but select those we think are most useful for sustaining
this online community. We appreciate all submissions, but will be more
selective in what we choose to post. Queries for contact info,
messages intended for just a few subscribers, messages that are not on
topic, "flame" messages, and free-standing personal poems or journal
entries will, in general, not be forwarded to the list.

1. Posting to the List

Our aim is to support, inform, and extend those directions in poetry
that are committed to innovations, renovations, and investigations of
form and/or/as content, to the questioning of received forms and
styles, and to the creation of the otherwise unimagined, untried,
unexpected, improbable, and impossible. While we recognize that other
lists may sponsor other possibilities for exchange, we request that
those participating in this forum keep in mind the specialized and
focused nature of this project and respect our decision to operate a
moderated list. The Poetics List exists to support and encourage
divergent points of view on innovative forms of modern and
contemporary poetry and poetics, and we are committed to doing what is
necessary to preserve this space for such dialog.

The Poetics List is a moderated list. Posts are limited to list
subscribers. All messages are reviewed by the editors in keeping with
the goals of the list as articulated in this Welcome Message. The
listserv is intended to be a productive communal space for discussion
and announcements; as such, subscribers who do not follow listserv
policy will be removed from the subscription roll.

Please note that this list is primarily concerned with discussions of
poetry and poetics. We strongly encourage subscribers to post
information, including web links, relating to publications (print and
internet), reading series, and blogs that they have coordinated,
edited or published, or in which they appear. Such announcements
constitute a core function of this list. Brief reviews of poetry
events and publications (print or digital) are always welcome.

The Poetics List is not a forum for a general discussion of poetry or
for the exchange of poems. Queres for contact info, messages intended
for just a few subscribers, "flame" messages, and free-standing
personal poems or journal entries will, in general, not be forwarded
to the list.

Also, please note that the Poetics List is not a "chat" list and we
discourage the posting of  very short messages intended for only a few
subscribers. Personal queries and off-topic submissions will not be
posted.

Send messages directly to the list address: poetics@listserv.buffalo.edu.


2. About the Poetics List

Above the world-weary horizons
New obstacles for exchange arise
Or unfold,
O ye postmasters!

With the preceding epigraph, the Poetics Listserv was founded by
Charles Bernstein in late 1993. Now in its fourth incarnation, the
list has over 1500 subscribers worldwide. We also have a substantial
number of nonsubscribing readers, who access the list through our web
site (see archive URL above).

Due to the high number of subscribers, we no longer maintain the open
format with which the list began (at under 100 subscribers).

Please also note that this is a not a general interest poetry list and
information about this list should not be posted to directories of
poetry lists. The idea is to keep the list membership to those with
specific engagement related to the list's stated orientation.

In addition to being archived through the EPC and at the UB Listerv
archive, some posts to Poetics (especially reviews, obituary notices,
announcements, etc.) may also become part of specific EPC subject
areas.

Note also that Roof Books published Joel Kuszai's edited collection of
the Poetics List; this is available from ROOF and also online at the
EPC.

3. Subscriptions

*For all subscription requests go to
http://listserv.acsu.buffalo.edu/archives/poetics.html.

*To subscribe for the first time click on "Subscribe (join) a List."
Immediately following your subscription to the poetics listserv we ask
that you email us at poetics.list --at -- gmail.com, subject-line
"registration," with your full name, street address, email address,
and telephone number. Failure to register at the time of subscription
will result in automatic deletion from the subscription roll.

*To manage your subscription (for descriptions of the different
subscription options please see section 3), click on "Subscriber's
Corner."

Subscriptions to the Poetics List are free of charge, but formal
registration is required. All other questions about subscriptions,
whether about an individual subscription or subscription policy,
should be addressed to this same administrative address.

PLEASE NOTE: All subscription-related information and correspondence
remains absolutely confidential.

All posts to the list must provide your full real name, as registered.
If there is any discrepancy between your full name as it appears in
the "from" line of the message header, please sign your post at the
bottom. Subscribers who do not include their full name with each post
will be unsubscribed from the list.

The most frequent problem with subscriptions is bounced messages. If
your system is often down or if you have a low disk quota, Poetics
messages may get bounced, which will result in your subscription being
automatically terminated by the Listserv program and the automatically
generated message telling you that this has occurred will also likely
bounce. If this happens, you may re-subscribe to the list by the same
process described above. One remedy to avoid this happening in the
future: set your list options to "no-mail" and read the list on the
web.

4. Subscription Options

We encourage you to alter your subscription options via the link on
the right side of the screen at
http://listserv.acsu.buffalo.edu/archives/poetics.html. If you would
prefer not to use the web-interface, you may also email
<listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu> the following commands:

*to subscribe to the Poetics listserv send
listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu this one-line message with no "subject":
sub poetics [your Firstname and Lastname]

*RECOMMENDED: if you wish to read the list on our web interface and
not receive any messages sent directly, while remaining subscribed to
the list and so eligible to send us posts, send this one-line message
to <listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu> with no "subject": set poetics
nomail. Note: this option is also useful for temporary suspension of
email service.

*to reactivate Poetics e-mail send <listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu>
this one-line message with no "subject": set poetics mail

* to receive the list in digest form (you will receive the day's
individual posts in one email sent just after midnight EST), send
<listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu> this one-line message with no
"subject": set poetics digest

*to receive posts in the default option (you will receive individual
postings immediately), send <listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu> this one-
line message with no "subject": set poetics nodigest

* to receive the list in index form (you will receive a list, without
the text of the posts, of the subjects discussed each day along with
the author's name and address and the number of lines it comprises;
you can also choose to have the index sent to you in either plain text
or in HTML format with hyperlinks), send
<listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu> this one-line message with no
"subject": set poetics nohtml index --or-- set poetics html index

PLEASE NOTE: do not leave your Poetics subscription in default or
digest mode if you are going to be away for any extended period of
time. Your account may become flooded and you may lose Poetics
messages as well as other important mail. In such cases, switch your
subscription to "nomail" as recommended above.

5. To Unsubscribe

To unsubscribe (or change any of your subscription options), again, we
strongly encourage you to go to the right-hand side of the screen at
http://listserv.acsu.buffalo.edu/archives/poetics.html You may also
may unsubscribe by sending a one-line email to
<listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu> with no "subject": unsub poetics

If you are having difficulty unsubscribing, please note: sometimes
your e-mail address may be changed slightly by your system
administrator. If this happens you will not be able to send messages
to Poetics or to unsubscribe, although you will continue to receive
mail from the Poetics List. To avoid this problem, unsub using your
old address, then resubscribe with your new email address.

6. Cautions

In moderating this list, the editors must consider sometimes competing
interests. The basis for our decisions, however, rests with our
collective judgment about the kind of space we want for the list.

All posts not only go out to list subscribers but also become a public
part of the list archive on the web. Note that posting to the list is
a form of publication and that by sending your message to the list you
formally consent to such web publication. Posts are currently being
indexed by search engines such as Google. It is not possible for us to
remove posts from the list archive or to control search engine
indexing of these posts.

For reasons of basic security, we do not allow pseudonymous
subscriptions. All messages intended for the Poetics List should be
sent in Text-Only format, without attachments. We do not accept
HTML-formatted messages or attached files. As a general rule, keep
individual posts to 1,000 words or less.

Please do not publish list postings without the express permission of
the author. Posting on the list is a form of publication. Copyright
for all material posted on Poetics remains with the author; material
from this list and its archive may not be reproduced without the
author's permission, beyond the standard rights accorded by "fair use"
of published materials.

All material on the Poetics List remains the property of the authors;
before you reproduce this material, in whole or in part, we ask that
you get permission (by email is fine) from the authors. If they give
permission, then we ask only that you say that the post or posts
appeared originally on the Poetics List
(http://epc.buffalo.edu/poetics/welcome.html) on [give date and say:]
Used by permission of the author.

Note: Private correspondence via email and letters are always =A9 the
author and may not be reproduced in whole or in part without the
written permission of the author. As a general rule, we will not
publish posts that include such material unless they indicate that
permission has been given.

We request that posters limit the number of posts they send to the
list on any given day. Given that our goal is a manageable list
(manageable both for moderators and subscribers), the list accepts 75
or fewer messages per day, though these parameters may be changed at
the discretion of the list moderator.

Like all systems, the listserv will sometimes be down: if you feel
your message has been delayed or lost, *please wait at least one day
to see if it shows up*, then check the archive to be sure the message
is not posted there; if you still feel there is a problem, you may
wish to contact the editors at <poetics.list@gmail.com>.

7. Flaming
"Flame" messages will not be tolerated on the Poetics List. We define
'flaming' as any post that resembles a personal attack or personal
insult to anyone--subscriber or not. This, of course, includes racist,
sexist, or other slurs as well as ad hominem arguments in which the
person rather than their work is attacked; in other words while
critique of a person's work is welcome (critical inquiry is one of the
main functions of the list), this critique cannot extend to a critique
or criticism of the person.

In every institution I know, a poem = zero papers. In other words, they
don't count in the quantification of academic output.

I've never encountered this sort of equivalency measure.  In departments I'v=
e known of, there's a general notion of how much publishing one should do (a=
lways a book for tenure) but no sense that one of one thing equals however m=
any of another.

Dear Friends of Big Bridge,=20

=20

I am writing to you about 100 THOUSAND POETS FOR CHANGE. This is an =
event I have begun to organize on Facebook and I am now bringing to =
those of you who are not using Facebook.=20

=20

100 THOUSAND POETS FOR CHANGE is a community action event scheduled for =
September 24, 2011, which will include readings, demonstrations, and =
concerts  happening simultaneously throughout the world in the name of =
poetry and change. We have been working on this project for only two =
weeks and the response has been inspiring. So far over 12 countries and =
25 cities have volunteered to organize an event.=20

=20

Below, I am posting information on 100 THOUSAND POETS FOR CHANGE as it =
appeared on Facebook.  I talk about "change" and "organizing" to give =
you some general ideas on how this event can work.  If you are =
interested in organizing a local group, please contact me by e-mail: =
walterblue@bigbridge.org, or join us at Facebook at =
http://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=3D106999432715571, and "friend" =
me. In a couple of weeks I will be putting up a 100 THOUSAND POETS FOR =
CHANGE blog for this event where each local event will have its own =
event page with event information, and poems, journals, photos, videos =
from events around the world.=20

=20

Please read the info below and if you have any more questions please =
feel free to contact me here at Big Bridge.=20

=20

Thanks for join us!

Best,

100 THOUSAND POETS FOR CHANGE

=20

Time: Saturday, September 24 =B7 11:30am - 11:30pm

Location:The event will takes place in many cities, at the same time and =
date, outdoors, and of course it will be televised.

=20

Created By Michael Rothenberg, Terri Carrion

=20

Do you want to join other poets around the USA and across the planet in =
a demonstration/ celebration of poetry to promote serious social and =
political change? If so sign up here and let's see if enough people are =
serious about an event like this. If enough people join this, then we =
can work on specifics, times, dates, descriptions, coordinate and make =
it real. This will be a good place to gather names and contacts for =
regional organization. Please post comments and ideas.=20

MORE ON 100 THOUSAND POETS for CHANGE: UPDATE, MARCH 27, 2011

=20

There is a lot of information developing on this event. If you read some =
of the wall posts on the Facebook event pages you can stay current. But, =
people do have two major questions.

=20

1) What kind of a change are we talking about?

2) I want to organize in my area. How do we begin to organize?

=20

"What kind of CHANGE are we thinking about?"

=20

The first order of change is for poets, writers, artists, anybody, to =
actually get together to create and perform, educate and demonstrate, =
simultaneously, with other communities around the world. This will =
change how we see our local community and the global community. We have =
all become incredibly alienated in recent years. We hardly know our =
neighbors down the street let alone our creative allies who live and =
share our concerns in other countries. We need to feel this kind of =
global solidarity. I think it will be empowering.

=20

And of course there is the political/social change that many of us are =
talking about these days. There is trouble in the world. Wars, ecocide, =
the lack of affordable medical care, racism, the list goes on.

=20

It appears that transformation towards a more sustainable world is a =
major concern and could be a global guiding principle for this event. =
Peace also seems to be a common cause. War is not sustainable. There is =
an increasing sense that we need to move forward and stop moving =
backwards. But I am trying not to be dogmatic. I am hoping that together =
we can develop our ideas of the "change/transformation" we are looking =
for as a group, and that each community group will decide their own =
specific area of focus for change for their particular event.

=20

"I want to organize in my area. How do we begin to organize?"

=20

100 Thousand Poets for Change will organize "participants" by local =
region, city, or state, and find individuals in each area who would like =
to organize their local event.  Just let me know if you want to be an =
organizer by sending a message to me directly through Facebook, or to my =
e-mail: walterblue@bigbridge.org.

=20

If you are an organizer for your community this means that first you =
will consider a location for the event and begin to contact people in =
your area who want to participate in the event. Participation means =
contacting the media, posting the event on the web, in calendars, =
newspapers, etc., reading poems, performing in general, supplying =
cupcakes and beer (it's up to you), demonstrating, putting up an =
information table, inviting guest speakers, musicians, etc., organizing =
an art exhibit, and documenting the event (this is important, too), and =
cleaning up, of course.

=20

Organizers and participants will create their own local event as an =
expression of who they are locally. Do they want a candlelight vigil or =
a circus, a march or a dance, do they want absolute silence, a group =
meditation on a main street; it's up to the local organization.  =
However, groups should be sure to hold some part of the event, if not =
all of it, outdoors, in public view.  The point is to be seen and heard, =
not just stay behind closed walls. It is also important that the event =
be documented.  Photos, videos, poems, journals, paintings! =
Documentation is crucial.  The rest of the 100 Thousand Poets for Change =
want to hear what you have to say about change and enjoy your creativity =
too! The documentation will be shared through a blog/website that I will =
set up, a blog/website where groups can share and announce event =
information, as well as post photos, videos, poetry, art, and thoughts. =
But an event doesn't have to involve tons of people. It can be just you =
(the organizer) and your pet, on a street corner, with a sign. Just let =
me know what you are planning! Every effort counts!

=20

Each local organization determines what it wants to focus on, something =
broad like, peace, sustainability, justice, equality, or more specific =
causes like Health Care, or Freedom of Speech, or local environmental or =
social concerns that need attention in your particular area right now, =
etc. Organizations will then come up with a mission statement/manifesto =
that describes who they are and what they think and care about.  When =
the whole event has taken place all the mission statements can be =
collected from around the world and, I hope, worked together into a =
grand statement of 100 Thousand Poets for Change.

=20

That's quick, off the top of my head, summary of where we are now with =
100 THOUSAND POETS FOR CHANGE.

=20

Thank you for joining us!

=20

Best, MR =20

"A superb poet and great inventor of poetry, Charles Bernstein
dazzlingly invents the essay for poetry: professing in a gorilla suit
and white tuxedo.”—George Lakoff

“This is a smart and invigorating book that triumphantly demonstrates
Charles Bernstein’s goals and values. Those who want satire, those who
want earnest discussion, those who want information, those who want to
get a sense of personality, those who want theory, those who want
entertainment, even those who wish to be confirmed in their beliefs and
those who wish to nurse their resentments, will all find something
here.”—Daisy Fried

“I regret to inform you that Charles Bernstein’s Attack of the Difficult
Poems is highly unsuitable (not suitable) for National Poetry Month. Not
suitable for acceptance by the publications of the Modern Language
Association or its affiliate, the Annual Convention. Not suitable for
readers under the age of five. Not suitable for endorsement by the Paris
Review. Not suitable for your average television sitcom. Not suitable
for tenure. Not suitable for free distribution. Not suitable for
variations in the ontological condition. Not suitable for readers of
generic poetry. Not suitable for the MFA. For everyone else:
priceless.”—Tan Lin

Charles Bernstein is our postmodern jester of American poesy, equal
parts surveyor of democratic vistas and scholar of avant-garde
sensibilities. In a career spanning thirty-five years and forty books,
he has provoked us with writing that is unafraid of the tensions between
ordinary and poetic language, and between everyday life and its
adversaries. Attack of the Difficult Poems, his latest collection of
essays, gathers some of his most memorably irreverent work while
addressing seriously and comprehensively the state of contemporary
humanities, the teaching of unconventional forms, fresh approaches to
translation, the history of language media, and the connections between
poetry and visual art.

Applying an array of essayistic styles, Attack of the Difficult Poems
ardently engages with the promise of its title. Bernstein introduces his
key theme of the difficulty of poems and defends, often in comedic ways,
not just difficult poetry but poetry itself. Bernstein never loses his
ingenious ability to argue or his consummate attention to detail. Along
the way, he offers a wide-ranging critique of literature’s place in the
academy, taking on the vexed role of innovation and approaching it from
the perspective of both teacher and practitioner.

 From blues artists to Tin Pan Alley song lyricists to Second Wave
modernist poets, The Attack of the Difficult Poems sounds both a battle
cry and a lament for the task of the language maker and the fate of
invention.

I think it depends upon the specialty. If the person is teaching in an MFA =
program then 5-7 creative works a year would be the norm. Whereas if the pe=
rson is a professor of Victorian Literature, only an academic article or bo=
ok would be counted.

Dear poets/publishers=2C
I'm teaching a graduate course next semester on the practice of the book re=
view. We're going to look specifically at poet's first books=2C books publi=
shed from January to July of 2011. Along with a survey of outlets for revie=
ws=2C review strategies=2C etc=2C each student will end up writing and atte=
mpting to publish about eight book reviews (from 250 words to 2=2C500 words=
). This is all to say=2C depending on enrollment=2C all of the books I'm go=
ing to teach will get between 10 & 25 reviews.=20
I'm putting the syllabus together over the course of the next few months an=
d would welcome any review copies you might be willing to float my way. I h=
ave a few books in mind=2C but I'm really open and would like a wide sampli=
ng of the field.=20
Again=2C I'm just looking for poet's first books published (or forthcoming)=
 between January and July 2011.=20
Thanks much=2C

Yes, I am.  Essays or poetry?

I have been having some very serious issues with creating posts for my =
poems & poetics blog. As many of you know, many of the posts require =
specific line breaks, paragraphing and other formatting. For some =
reason, Blogger has been erasing all formatting and turning certain =
posts into large blocks of unbroken text. This occurs - sporadically but =
more often than not -- when I publish the post or have it scheduled for =
later date. When I return to check, the formatting is gone and =
attempting to correct it has proved futile: when I return hours later, =
the formatting is still gone.=20

=20

It was suggested I try a different browser, but that has not helped. Has =
anyone had this problem? I'm becoming a little desperate as it's hard to =
keep up with the blog while on the road - as at present -- and the =
constant correction of posts is incredibly frustrating as the changes do =
not remain.

=20

If you have any suggestions or can point me in the right direction, =
please email to jrothenberg [at] cox [dot] net or to my assistant Amish =
Trivedi at amishius [at] gmail [dot] com.=20

Thank you for any help you can give. The blog, as always, can be found =
at poemsandpoetics.blogspot.com.

Hi=0A
=0AI live in Japan tho originally from the U.S.=A0 I applied to teach a gra=
d course in American poetry in Tokyo at a private japanese university.=A0 A=
t that time I had published a number of books of poetry as well as well ove=
r a hundred poems in journals etc but was told tho it was nice that i was "=
creative" they wanted to see somebody who had published academic articles a=
bout poetry.=A0 Fortunately I had a few of those and that got me the job (v=
ersus my poetry publications which I viewed personally as more important an=
d more "elite" in that they were often published in more competitive places=
--and=A0 were far more numerous).=0A
=0AAt my current full time job (i have a tenured associate professor facult=
y position in Japan), publications are ranked by type versus content, e.g. =
book, book chapter, journal article, newsletter article, textbook author, t=
ranslator, and various forms of "other" which include poems, papers given a=
t conferences, artistic presentations (e.g. an art exhibit, poetry reading,=
 etc.).=A0 So a book counts for more than an article etc.=A0 Nobody checks =
the content of what we do, more the quantity.=A0 However to be promoted to =
full professor publications aren't enough, a lot of administrative work don=
e for the school especially helps one get promoted.=A0 Because my workload =
is already too high in my opinion, I have successfully avoided promotion to=
 full professor (that would increase my workload further so I don't wish to=
 be promoted) tho ive been eligible numerous times.
=0AAt a different university somebody actually read what i wrote before hir=
ing me.=A0 in fact that is not necessarily unusual here in Japan--people ma=
y actually read what you wrote before being hired but "academic" publicatio=
ns may be judged more important than "creative" ones like the example above=
.=A0 Once you get the job, tho, nobody may actually read anything you do an=
d will just judge you by the number of works or the status of the publisher=
.=A0 Unfortunately=A0 at my current university publications are not conside=
red so important for promotion tho at other Japanese universities teachers =
may be more encouraged to do research and publications may carry more weigh=
t.=A0 Some schools may not want researchers who will prefer to do research =
(or write poems) rather than various grunt work expected of teachers done f=
or their institutions.=A0 In Japan the grunt workload for a university teac=
her can be substantial.=A0 I don't know how it compares with other countrie=
s
 but probably compares unfavorably.=A0 Yet an american uni prof told me som=
e public universities ask teachers to do a million tasks that are neither t=
eaching nor research.=A0 If that's the case, it would be similar to some un=
iversities in Japan including my own.=0A
=0Awe don't really have degrees in creative writing in Japan however so tha=
t may be significant too?=A0 i myself teach literature (poetry exclusively)=
=A0 plus unrelated subjects (gender, pedagogy, etc.) for students majoring =
in american and british studies at a national teachers college.=0A
im curious about how poets are valued at different institutions abroad so t=
his thread interests me quite a lot.

=0Ai wanted to also inquire about time off for writing 4 poets working as t=

=0Ai find that to be very difficult working as a uni teacher in japan.=A0 t=
he vacations are very short and full of administrative tasks.=A0 sabbatical=
s at my university are only a few months and only partial (you still have t=
o come in to the uni for some things) and you can't resign for several year=
s after if you do it and you take a pay cut during it etc.=A0=A0 to find ti=
me to write you must be extremely resourceful:-)=0A
=0Aim hoping to get in a position where i could survive financially on part=
 time work in order to write and study more.=0A
=0Awondering what it is like elsewhere.=A0 a uni teacher has more free time=
 than a businessperson that's for sure however in japan and more freedom ov=
erall of course. =A0(the job market for uni teachers has been difficult her=
e for some time due to an economic recession and low birth rate)=0A
=0Aif i get promoted ill have more courses and administrative work so the w=
ay thus far ive avoided promotion is to turn in my promotion paperwork late=
 (after the deadline) every year. that way my name gets removed from the li=

curious about how it works in other countries for poets=0A

That's a really cool idea, and it is sort of similar to a course I taught at
Antioch LA a while back (I got the NBCC involved); I was able to get
donations of books from presses for the first iteration, and I was able to
hook up several students (and they, me, BTW) with various publishers of
reviews, esp. online and in zines -- the reviews do get published, which is
exciting for everyone involved.  For the second iteration, I also allowed
eBooks, and THAT is something that can hold down student costs and lead to
surprises.

Plz keep posted,
Catherine Daly

Jerome,

Changing browsers won't help. You need to change your content management
software for your website. You need something better than blogger.

You may wish to go with Joomla, or a locally installed version of wordpress.
Of course, to do that, you need your own site hosting and domain name, but
that will only cost you about five bucks a month. Write me off-line, and I
can point you in the right direction.

Thanks,

Bill

Dear Buffalo Poetics Listees ...

Cordite Poetry Review 35: Oz-Ko is a special issue showcasing new poetry
from Australia
and Korea. Check out the first stage of the issue here:

http://www.cordite.org.au/content/poetry/ozko-envoy

It's called 'Oz-Ko: Envoy' because it features twenty new poems by
Australian poets and is intended to act as an envoy or advance party
introducing what promises to be a vast issue filled with poetry in English
and Hangul, features, articles, photo essays and other ephemera.

Subsequent stages of the issue will appear online in May and June, with new
features posted weekly between now and then, so I'd encourage you to check
back every so often to see how Oz-Ko is unfolding.

Oh, and a quick reminder: submissions are still open for our thirty-sixth
issue, Electronic(a). Subs close at the end of April. More details here:

http://www.cordite.org.au/submissions

In the meantime, I hope you enjoy the poems we've posted so far ...

Best wishes

On Attack of the Difficult Poems:

"A superb poet and great inventor of poetry, Charles Bernstein
dazzlingly invents the essay for poetry: professing in a gorilla suit
and white tuxedo.”—George Lakoff

“This is a smart and invigorating book that triumphantly demonstrates
Charles Bernstein’s goals and values. Those who want satire, those who
want earnest discussion, those who want information, those who want to
get a sense of personality, those who want theory, those who want
entertainment, even those who wish to be confirmed in their beliefs and
those who wish to nurse their resentments, will all find something
here.”—Daisy Fried

“I regret to inform you that Charles Bernstein’s Attack of the Difficult
Poems is highly unsuitable (not suitable) for National Poetry Month. Not
suitable for acceptance by the publications of the Modern Language
Association or its affiliate, the Annual Convention. Not suitable for
readers under the age of five. Not suitable for endorsement by the Paris
Review. Not suitable for your average television sitcom. Not suitable
for tenure. Not suitable for free distribution. Not suitable for
variations in the ontological condition. Not suitable for readers of
generic poetry. Not suitable for the MFA. For everyone else:
priceless.”—Tan Lin

Kevin Rabas' language flits between narrative and poetry to bring these
characters=97and their struggles with youth, love and identity=97to life. S=
weet
and heartbreaking at the same time, the stories in *Spider Face* leave
indelible images long after you close the book. =97*Jen McConnell*, author =
of
*Welcome Anybody*



*Spider Face* is a collection of true images that linger in the place
between memories and dreams. Kevin Rabas dresses the dramas of mental healt=
h
and sensuality, self-destruction and loyalty, grief and social status, in a
veil of constant discoveries that dance translucent around each story. Thes=
e
are all moments of heat and passion, whether that is passion of belief,
passion of music or passion of flesh, that are concentrated examples of how
everyday experiences create who a person is, and, in turn, how a person
creates themselves through those same events. =97*Matthew Porubsky*, author
of *voyeur poems*



That Kevin Rabas is a fierce new talent was already clear from his two
previous books of poetry. Now, in this collection of short fiction, he
reveals himself a writer of great breadth and ability. These brief tales
reveal an accomplished poet=92s eye in images that startle with their beaut=
y
and precision and a storyteller=92s sense for character and dramatic arc. I=
n
mimimal, sometimes snapshot-like stories that dazzle like flashbulbs with
their sudden radiance, Rabas explores the tumults of sex and youth, love an=
d
the body, violence and art. His range of artistic gifts as a poet,
photographer and jazz musician serve him=97and his readers=97well, and esta=
blish
him as a writer of fiction to watch and enjoy.  =97*Tasha Haas*, author
of *Certain
Dawn, Inevitable Dawn*

Enclaves of Theory and Theology

===================================================================

You may lie on my first, by the side of a stream,
And my second compose to the Nymph you adore
But if when you've none of my whole, her esteem
And affection diminish, think of her no more
                                        Jane. [Austen]

(Charade - answer, a banknote.)

[ But a different answer, away from capital, may be given altogether,
"whole" replaced by the homonym "hole," "lie" curled in meaning, and
"first" taken elsewhere; this is the application of local theory,
an _ontology_ of capital replaced by the body, the body ultimately
inaccessible. And then, what happens to capital? ]

===================================================================

Abstract: My bad theory: If anything is basic it's lack. We scramble to
suture the rest. We can't. We think we do.

===================================================================

I pay no attention to theology; inerrancy or core belief is already dead
in relation to its imperviousness. Think of god or spirit as token; as
ulterior, in-evident, there is little to say about them, except of course
for what might be enacted in their name.

Theory is no longer at an impasse; theory - in the sense, in any sense, of
speaking the world, is already lost. It's lost in technology, in the
concrete, which it misplaces and misinterprets - how can one speak of
codework without understanding code, speak of epistemology without access
to, and understanding of, the very machines that extend, at least for the
privileged, the real - whose very definition is characterized by
withdrawal? The entanglement of theoretical subject and object is best
served by quantum mechanics from below, now approaching the level of
ordinary visibility.

This is occasioned by recent readings into theory, where it is clear that
the authors were circumlocuting a field they had little knowledge of - in
this case, codework - but it's also occasioned by an increasing dissatis-
faction with theory's applications beyond the social in general. It's too
easy to slip from augmented reality or virtual worlds or virtual reality
itself, to ontologies or epistemologies, with the receding dream of the
fundamental guiding one astray. There are several levels involved, all
crumbling, all entangled - the physical-real, the mathematics of the world
(however world and mathesis are defined), the current technologies of the
world (ditto), access to these technologies, theory and its techne - and
melding or interoperability among all of these. It's theory that
disappears in the mix - or the rest of us; increasingly, to understand the
world has come to mean to understand technical vocabularies on all levels
- from conceptual/theoretical astuteness to access to tools, which depends
on the grace of institutions and individuals. In my own case, Patrick
Lichty and Sandy Baldwin directed me towards mocap at their institutions;
Frances van Scoy extended the invitation to 3-d scanners; Mark Skwarek
guided me through the beginnings of mocap, and so forth. I walk in and out
of labs with residencies that range (once) from half a year to (most
often) 2-3 days. I walk into institutions, into institutional cultures; in
this regard I'm luckier than most. But the access remains highly limited,
and what's more important here, the resulting phenomenology is always
bracketed. I suspect this is the case for most people; it's a matter of
degree. All I can do - all _anyone_ can do - is write from the outside,
from the external (within or without a phenomenology of externality), but,
by grace of these invitations, I have learned, at the least, my limits.
Theory on the other hand proceeds without limits; its contemporary
over-reliance on the body, abjection, sexuality, and other issues is to
some extent a withdrawal to a fictional core that remains inviolate: begin
and end with the body of the theorist, and the details of codework for
example will either be bypassed, introjected, or seen as irrelevant. None
of this would matter, if theory didn't carry the weight it does; we've all
read descriptions of our own work as if they're written in a foreign
language, indecipherable with occasional partial legibilities that seem
inherently wrong. Media (in the sense of writing-about, placing that
writing, receiving and remediating that writing) does that to one, and
there's little recourse at the other end. (On the other hand, our own
descriptions, as cultural workers, often chart out vast philosophical
terrain, as if materiality - and the bridging between abstract theory and
materiality - made a difference. I'm guilty of that! In this enclaved
essay I'm guilty of that!)

When I give a talk now, I try to begin with issues of "the fragility of
good things" (from catastrophe theory), extinctions, global slaughter
coupled with populations exponentially increasing - and enclaving, a
concept borrowed from Mike Davis, emphasizing the secure and violent walls
placed around the wealthy, around global institutions and bodies, around
governance in general. Theory itself is enclaved in this regard - as is
the epistemology/ontology of the real (at variance with theory), dependent
on Fermilab, the LHC, AR, holographic VR, etc. etc. - pick your level,
your machine, your theorist. The levels aren't interoperable, nor are they
well-defined. The result is brilliant production, with either micro-man-
aged phenomenology, or phenomenology left in the dust. (Brian Greene's The
Hidden Reality figures here for example.)

It's characteristic of this short essay, that _I don't know what I'm
talking about, nor can I_ - which is why the weaker the theory, the more
functional. I keep thinking of the usual question, for example - Why is
there something rather than nothing - and coming up with the exhaustive
positioning of physical bootstrapping, the universe bringing itself,
continuously, into existence, so that the Why - which implies both origins
and causality - if it doesn't fade away, at least is in need of a coronary
bypass. The solidity or projection of real or virtual objects stands
ultimately in relation to physical theory; if holography plays a role in
our appearing, how many codings occur to construct a virtual world?

The bottom line, not the fundamental one, is the failure of regimes - of
technology, theory, coding, phenomenology, physical and somatic realities
- to interconnect, in combination with apparent flows of power among them.
This power is split and sutured by human claims among humans that don't
quite interconnect. I'm not talking about the old notion of two cultures,
but about fragmentation everywhere, suturing within micro-domains (code,
technology, augmented and diminished realities, theory, daily life). This
is hard to grasp, when even this description falls apart, is rifted; how
could it be otherwise? I'm not talking about the old notion of master
narratives, but about a collocation of narratives, topologically-distinct
but fuzzy and broken sememes. I'm not talking about a dearth of ontologies
but about ontologies as local conventions, epistemologies always already
under contestation. (Which is amazing and liberation; there are just the
old Sartrean issues of scarcity economics in the midst of Bataille's
surplus increasingly harbored from above.)

And I'm talking about enclaving brought about by an exponential increase
in knowledge, coupled by an exponential increase in wealth among a small
and isolated class - both have utterly transformed the landscape, origin-
ally one of privilege, network broadcast, and limited access - through a
period of net neutrality, open sourcing knowledge (but not medical care,
basic survival safety nets, life on the ground), and a distant horizon of
universal open channels of information and communication - to one again of
technological privilege, limited broadcast and access, local control. I
can see the model changing from the imperial through the appearance of
democracy, back through neoliberalism to an imperium in everything but
name. Better managed this time, everything appears better and better
advertised; it's just a kind blurriness in the details: WELCOME TO THE
TELECOMS OF THE REAL.

"The Scrounge" are a developing collection of poems, mostly started in '09 and
finished now. There is no one coherent theme; rather, like "Returns," the poems
are meant to sit loosely in relation to each other.

Description:=20
=E2=80=9DyumdZ=E2=80=9D is a computer-generated process, a self-regulated s=
tochastic text written using old 8-bit computer, Atari 65XE, as the only so=
urce. The text is composed of random bytes, memory dumps and characters map=
ped to Atari's own ATASCII set, a near-chaotic travel inside to the compute=
r's memory, instead of metaphorical we are traveling literally to the world=
 of the hexadecimal numbers, POKE/PEEK commands and 6502 processor assembly=
 opcodes. This book is a document of the trip.

One wonders, of course, about the controlling wisdom of J2's announcement:

"Jacket2 does not accept unsolicited submissions. . ."

And: "Jacket2 publishes new poetry only as part of critical commentaries
and features; we are not currently reading submissions of poetry."

Poems: the *un*necessary part of poetry.

In its 5th annual recognition of National Poetry Month in April, the
Tribute WTC Visitor Center this year will collect Haiku written to the
people of Japan .  The poems are being solicited via TributeWTC on
Twitter and the Tribute WTC Visitor Center Fan page on Facebook, as well
as during a haiku workshop at Tribute on Thursday, April 14, from 3-5 pm
when poet Steve Dalachinsky will be working with visitors to guide them
in the art of haiku.  After the event, all of the poems that have been
submitted will be placed into a booklet that will be sent to the people
of Japan .
A haiku is a traditional Japanese form that aims to express the moment.
It is a short poem that reflects lightness, sadness, and beauty, and
incorporates elements of nature and the seasons. The haiku workshop at
the Tribute WTC Visitor Center is free and open to the public.  Tribute
WTC Visitor Center is at 120 Liberty Street , between Church and
Greenwich .  For more information, visit our website, www.tributewtc.org.

The event will feature short talks by August Kleinzahler, Maureen McLane, and Tom Pickard and will include a screening of Pickard's film about Fisher, "Birmingham Is What I Think With." The Friday evening prior to the symposium, the presenters will give a group reading of their own and Fisher's poetry.

Born in 1930, Roy Fisher is a British poet of remarkable range. Stripped of ornament, skeptical in temperament, his poems find music in sharp angles, hesitations, and silences. They often move through post-industrial landscapes of Birmingham and the English Midlands, registering crepuscular half-tones, "the dog odour / of water," and "malted-milk brickwork."

Beyond such literal subjects, Fisher captures the intermingling of fancy and perception, the play of light and shadow in the mind itself. As August Kleinzahler has suggested, "The eye darts about in Fisher's poetry. It abhors the object at rest, framing of any kind. It's like a camera, jerking and swiveling on an unstable tripod. Early and late, the poetry is about the eye in motion. The shifts may be subtle or vertiginously abrupt. It's best not to get too comfortable as you progress through a poem because you're not going to be where you think you are for long."

His restless and exploratory poetry has long been admired in the United Kingdom, and by a select few readers in the United States. His Selected Poems, edited by Kleinzahler and designed to introduce his work to an American audience, has just been published by Flood Editions.

The symposium is free and open to the public but *REGISTRATION IS REQUIRED FOR THIS EVENT*. Simply send an e-mail to john.tipton64@gmail.com with your first and last name so we can put you on the access list, and bring photo ID to the event. This is a building security requirement.

Kenning Editions <http://www.kenningeditions.com> proudly announces the
publication of the long-awaited second novel by *Pamela Lu*, *AMBIENT
PARKING LOT.
*
Part fiction, part earnest mockumentary, /Ambient Parking Lot/ follows a
band of musicians as they wander the parking structures of urban
downtown and greater suburbia in quest of the ultimate ambient noise,
one that promises to embody their historical moment and deliver them up
to the heights of their self-important artistry. Along the way, they
make sporadic forays into lyric while contending with doubts, delusions,
miscalculations, mutinies, and minor triumphs. This saga peers into the
wreckage of a post 9/11 landscape and embraces the comedy and poignancy
of failed utopia.

On Pamela Lu's previous novel---"Pamela: A Novel is one of the finest
books to emerge from the ardent, experimental writing scene in the Bay
Area . . . Lu builds a social space and founds a society."---/The
Stranger/ "Reading the word 'I' in this novel becomes a mystical
experience---an invitation to connect to the 'I' in all of us . . . This
is a work of 'precision,' as Robert Musil would say, 'in matters of the
soul.' It extends the novel's capacity to think."---/Rain Taxi Review of
Books/ "Lu, in her debut, . . . [creates] a precise and humorous elegy
to the self, and to its self-subversions . . . This is a book of
extraordinary philosophical subtlety and clarity, one that manages to
tell a beautiful story in spite of itself."---/Publishers Weekly/

ISBN: 9780976736431 binding: PAPERBACK 200pp.

The Theorizing Lecture Series presents:

GEORGE QUASHA
"Principle Art: The Poetics of Thinking"

Tuesday, April 19th at 5:00 PM
Max Kade Center room 329, A Wing
3401 Walnut St. next to Starbucks

Artist, poet, critic, and musician George Quasha works across mediums
and disciplines to explore principles in common within language,
sculpture, drawing, video, sound, installation, and performance. Solo
exhibitions of "axial stones" and "axial drawings" include the
Baumgartner Gallery in New York (Chelsea), the Slought Foundation in
Philadelphia, and at the Samuel Dorsky Museum of Art at SUNY New Paltz.
His lecture will present a theory of "principle" in art, poetry, music,
thinking, and consciousness, and in particular the "axial principle,"
where "principle" is in contrast (and yet complementary) to "conceptual"
art.

His recent books are: /Verbal Paradise/ /(preverbs)/ (as the first of a
6 volume work of "preverbs") (Zasterle Press, 2011); /An Art of Limina:
Gary Hill's Works and Writings/, with Charles Stein, Foreword by Lynne
Cooke (Poligrafa: Barcelona, 2010); /Axial Stones: An Art of Precarious
Balance/ (North Atlantic Books: 2006).

Quasha other books include poetry (/Somapoetics/, /Giving the Lily Back
Her Hands/, /Ainu Dreams/ [with Chie Hasegawa]); anthologies (/America a
Prophecy/ [with Jerome Rothenberg], /Open Poetry/ [with Ronald Gross],
/An Active Anthology/ [with Susan Quasha], /The Station Hill Blanchot
Reader/ [with Charles Stein]); and writing on art (/Gary Hill: Language
Willing/; with Charles Stein: /Tall Ships, HanD HearD/liminal objects/,
/Viewer/. Quasha's awards include a National Endowment for the Arts
Fellowship in poetry and a Guggenheim Fellowship in video art in 2006.
He has taught at Stony Brook University (SUNY), Bard College, New School
University (Graduate Anthropology Department), and Naropa University. He
is also the founder/publisher of Station Hill Press of Barrytown (New
York) with Susan Quasha.

Free and open to the public. Refreshments will be served.

/Generously co-sponsored by the Graduate Group in Comparative Literature
and Literary Theory, the English Department, the Art History
Department's Zero Fund, the Theorizing Reading Group, and the Graduate
and Professional Student Assembly (GAPSA)./

Ed Roberson was born and raised in Pittsburgh, where he studied painting =
in
his youth and was educated at the University of Pittsburgh. His =
extensive
travels inform his work,which is also influenced by spirituals and the
blues, and by visual art, such as the mixed-media collages of Romare
Beardon. Poet and critic Michael Palmer

Roberson =93one of the most deeply innovative and critically acute =
voices of

Lenore Marshall Award, and Voices Cast Out to Talk Us In (1995), which =

Dear list,

I am forwarding the blog that has been created to honor and remember Paul Violii. Paul taught in the McGhee Division of NYU for more years than I can say. He was there long before I became coordinator of the program. He was a delight to work with. His crinkled up smile could make your day.

His impact on students was enormous. His poetry is alive and well.

I think his family --probably at his request -- has been private about details. But the idea is to send this blog to them as a testament to the love and respect so many people felt -- and feel -- for him.

Content-Type: text/plain; charset=windows-1252

3 new books from Burning Deck now available from www.burningdeck.com, =
www.spdbooks.org, and in Europe: www.audiatur.no/Bokhandel


1. Gale Nelson
THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS WHEN TALK ENDS
Poetry, 104 pages, offset, smyth-sewn
ISBN13: 978-1-936194-06-3, original paperback $14

There are 8 sets of 8 poems. All poems within a set follow the vowel =
pattern of a particular passage from Shakespeare. They could be called =
homovocalic translations of Shakespeare though they ignore his content =
while trying to build toward their own coherence. The sets are not =
presented in linear succession. Instead, the poems are arranged in a =
chess pattern, the earliest surviving knight's circuit, attributed to =
al-Adli ar-Rumi of Baghdad and presumed to date from 840 AD.

Born in Los Angeles, Gale Nelson has lived in Providence since the =
1980s. He is Assistant Director of the Department of Literary Arts. =
Burning Deck has earlier published his CETERIS PARIBUS and STARE =
DECISIS. He is represented in the anthology, 49+1: NOUVEAUX PO=C8TES =
AM=C9RICAINS, and two of this plays, are included in THE JOY OF =
PHONETICS AND ACCENTS by Louis Colaianni. He is also the editor of =
Paradigm Press.
On CETERIS PARIBUS:
=93...a landscape of structures and variables, carefully recording =
instances in which language enjambs to the point of crisis and consigns =
itself to an altered path. Nelson flashes in and out of poetic modes =
that he is able to rein in from the brink of cacophony and craft into an =
engaging series of poems.=94=97David Harrison Horton, Syllogism


2. Christina Mengert
AS WE ARE SUNG
Poetry, 64 pages, offset, smyth-sewn
ISBN13: 978-1-936194-05-6, original paperback $14

This first book by a trained vocalist explores the transformation from =
"I am speaking" to "I am singing," and where exactly poetry fits between =
these two limits. Restlessly, in abrupt (sometimes humorous) shifts it =
examines the subtle, the inaccessible, what is too fine for our senses, =
=93the song that is sung between notes.=94 The poems seem almost to =
disperse, to float off into a space as vast and as tolerant of =
indeterminacy as Barbara Guest=92s, where seeming emptiness can turn =
into a fullness of motion, potential, song, being.

Christina Mengert has crossed the country from her native Georgia via =
Rhode Island to Denver (where she earned a Ph.D. in English/Creative =
Writing) and now on to New York State, to teach in Bard College's Prison =
Initiative Program.
She is co-editor of 12X12: CONVERSATIONS IN 21ST CENTURY POETRY AND =
POETICS (University of Iowa Press). Her poems and reviews have appeared =
in WEB CONJUNCTIONS, AUFGABE, COLORADO REVIEW, THE NEW REVIEW OF =
LITERATURE, RECONFIGURATIONS, DENVER QUARTERLY, CONSTANT CRITIC etc.


3. David Lepiau
FOUR CUT-UPS, OR, THE CASE OF THE RESTORED VOLUME
translated from the French by Keith Waldrop
Poetry, 72 pages, offset, smyth-sewn
ISBN 978-1-936194-04-9  original paperback $14

Real and fictional characters (Mrs. Lindbergh, Gertrude Stein, William =
Burroughs, Billy Budd or the Kid) circulate through the four parts of =
Four Cut-ups or The Case of the Restored Volume which, in the way of a =
mobile, uses constant movement to construct a precise form out of =
fragmented perceptions, ideas, stories, quotations. A form that gives a =
strangely uncanny sheen to the most realistic details.

Born in 1969 in Bayonne, David Lespiau lives and works in Marseille. His =
prose, poetry, and reviews have appeared in many French magazines. He =
coedited the journal ISSUE (2002-2005) and has translated Charles =
Reznikoff as well as, with others, Joan Retallack, Kristin Prevallet, =
and Elizabeth Willis.
An English version by Cole Swensen is part of his trilingual OUIJA-BOARD =
(2008). Among his other books are L=92=C9PREUVE DU PRUSSIEN, LA =
POURSUITE DE TOM (BOTH 2003),
LA POULE EST UN OISEAU AUTODIDACTE (2005),
LA FILLE DU D=C9PARTEMENT FICTION (2007), AND
DJINN JAUNE (2008).

Keith Waldrop's most recent books are TRANSCENDENTAL STUDIES (National =
Book Award in Poetry), SEVERAL GRAVITIES (collages, Siglio Press), and =
THE REAL SUBJECT. He has translated Baudelaire as well as contemporary =
French poets like Anne-Marie Albiach, Claude Royet-Journoud, Paol =
Keineg, Dominique Fourcade, and Jean Grosjean.=

DENISE DOOLEY lives in Rogers Park, Chicago.  She reads and writes with Next Objectivist Workshop at Mess Hall.  Her chapbook Drumtops is available through Con/Crescent Press at concrescentpress.org and poems have appeared in Con/Crescent, Shampoo, Court Green, and elsewhere.

She currently co-curates the Red Rover reading series and teaches Writing and Literature at the School of the Art Institute and Loyola University.

JENNIFER KARMIN's text-sound epic, Aaaaaaaaaaalice, was published by Flim Forum Press in 2010. She curates the Red Rover Series and is co-founder of the public art group Anti Gravity Surprise. Her multidisciplinary projects have been presented at festivals, artist-run spaces, community centers, and on city streets across the U.S., Japan, and Kenya. A proud member of the Dusie Kollektiv, she is the author of the Dusie chapbook Evacuated: Disembodying Katrina. Walking Poem, a collaborative street project, is featured online at How2.  In Chicago, Jennifer teaches creative writing to immigrants at Truman College and works as a Poet-in-Residence for the public schools.

LUIS HUMBERTO VALADEZ is a poet/musician/performer from Chicago Heights, IL. His work is heavily influenced by an ilk of artists including Harryette Mullen, Amiria Baraka, Sonia Sanchez, and Anne Waldman as well as the economically depressed Chicago southern suburb he grew up in, and his mother, who constantly implored him to "get out of the Heights." These influences figure heavily into his first collection of poetry "what i'm on," published by the University of Arizona Press. He went to school at Columbia College Chicago and the Jack Kerouac School of Disembodied Poetics at Naropa University. He also teaches and works as an AmeriCorps VISTA Supervisor for Chicago HOPES, an after-school tutoring and arts initiative for children living in Chicago homeless shelters

?(I was in this forest of frosting),? by  Kara Imre

I was in this forest of frosting
and I licked the top.

I was in this forest of frosting
and the trees were totally baked.

I was in this forest of frosting
and the cake-people had eyes.

I was in this forest of frosting
and there was no funfetti.

I was in this forest of frosting
and the birds held knives.

I was in this forest of frosting
and everything was dead but me.

Hello

I'd like to announce a new book of mine, fresh out on BlazeVOX:

*Field Work -- Notes, Songs, Poems, 1997-2010*

this is an updated, expanded version of a chapbook some of you may be
familiar with

called *SF Spleen*, pub. by Skanky Possum in 2006

for a limited time you can get copies for $10 sale price
here<http://habenichtpress.com/?p=3D725>
:

(http://habenichtpress.com/?p=3D725)

or

Field Work page at
Blazevox<http://www.blazevox.org/index.php/Shop/Poetry/field-work-notes-son=
gs-poems-1997-2010-by-david-hadbawnik-228/>

Also on Amazon, SPD, etc.

from the back cover:


In San Francisco, Austin and Buffalo a *chiel*=92s among ye taking notes.  =
David
Hadbawnik like James Boswell has a knack for capturing all the things we
wish we had said, as well as the street talk which shows up our culture as
indescribably banal and fertile.  On his way to developing a unique poetic,
Hadbawnik kept writing it down; these twelve years of *fl=E2neur*ing perfor=
m a
voyage of their own, a powerful and mysterious walk towards unknowing.



                                                                        =97=
Kevin
Killian





The notebooks of Kafka and the late meditations of Wittgenstein echo deep
inside David Hadbawnik=92s marvelous *Field Work*, whose investigations
collect into something like a scrolling *wunderkammer* of anecdotal
revelation. Or into a tour-de-force *ostranenie* of the quotidian, one migh=
t
say... Which is to say, and more plainly, I suppose, that in these
quasi-aphoristic sallies, daily moments are never quite what they first
seem, always infolding much more than what we all almost always assume them
to hold. So Hadbawnik looks carefully and insistently. And he does so again
and again. And the mundane unfolds its mysteries. =93One minute in the life=
 of
the world is going by. Paint it as it is,=94 said Cezanne. That is the
writer=92s ethic here, and the result is nothing less than a strange, seria=
l,
and many-chambered gift. We haven=92t had a truly great =93poet=92s daybook=
=94 for
quite some time, one that enacts a poetics. Here you are.



                        =97Kent Johnson

The Printer to the Reader



It hath bin an old saying, that whiles two doggs do strive for a bone, the
thirde may come and carie it away. And this proverbe may (as I feare) be we=
l
verefied in me which take in hand the imprinting of this poeticall Poesie.
For the case seemeth doubtful, and I will disclose my conjecture. Master C.
B. (in a separate missive) hath cunningly dischaged himselfe of any
responsibilitie for this texte, as the graver sort of greyhaired judgers
mighte (perhaps) conceive in the publication of these pleasant Pamphlets.
And beside that, a message from K. G. (with whome as seemeth, the original
copie hereof was passed from one to th=92other), doth with no lesse clerkly
cunning seeke to perswade the printer, that he (also) had no hande in its
making; and bothe gentlemen woulde by no meanes have it published. I am not
privie, forsooth, to any declaratione at this date from K.S.M., nor from
V.P., nor K.J., these most notorious persons, too, assumed in some quarters
as the Authores. This in despyte of what the venerable C.D. hath recently
informed us, namely, =93=92Tis come a time when affixing one=92s signature =
to an
alien text be in no wise remarkable, and we fain arrive at the next frontie=
r
of proprietie, when the institutions of poetry shall be agonized by *script=
ores
conceptiones* signing for others under texts the which themselves have not
written.=94 Now I feare very muche (all these words notwithstanding) that t=
he
aforementioned C.B. and K.G. were of one assent compact to have it
imprinted: And yet, finding by experience that nothing is so wel handled no=
w
adayes, but that some malicious minds may either take occasion to mislike i=
t
themselves, or else finde meanes to make it odious unto others: They have
therefore (each of them) politiquely prevented the daunger of misreport, an=
d
suffered me the poore Printer to runne away with the palme of so perillous =
a
victorie. Notwithstanding, having wel perused the worke, I find nothing
therein amisse (to my judgemente) unlesse it be two or three wanton places
passed over in the discourse of a dubious enterprise: The which for as much
as the words are cleanly (although the thing ment be somewhat satiricall) I
have thought good also to let them passe as they came to me, and the rather
bicause (as master C. B. hath well alleged in his letter) the well minded
reader may reape some commoditie out of the most frivolous works that are
written. And as the venomous spider will sucke poison out of the most
holesome herbe, and the industrious Bee can gather hony out of the most
stinking weede: Even so the discrete reader may take a happie example by th=
e
most vicious verses, although the captious and harebrained heads can neithe=
r
be encoraged by the good, nor forewarned by the bad. To conclude, the worke
of the most mysterious Rejection Groupe is so universall, as either in one
place or other, any mans mind may therewith be satisfied. The which I
adventure (under pretext of this promise) to present unto all indifferent
eyes as followeth.



New Rejection Groupe chapbookes available: $7 each, black or white cover;
$20 for a *very limited edition* signed copy by K.G., V.P., K.S.M., C.B.,
and K.J.

 Up
 on the new Jacket(I think) Ron Halpern has a good, intense piece on on
the importance of Steve Abbot's San Francisco based SOUP magazine with great attention to
Bruce Boone's critique of early Lang Po and New Narrative differences
via attention to Bob Perleman, Steve Benson, and F Jameson. Definitely
brings back the ferocious (often) arguments, fierce rumblings of late 70's, early 80's. New Content versus New Forms.

On *Ec(o)logues*..........

What this book does has never been done even by Peter Lamborn Wilson himsel=
f
before now; with all his exuberant learning and poetics, it offers the firs=
t
coherent, lucid scrutiny of the intricate interweaving of traditionary
sciences with the contemporary need to rescue our planet and our sanity. Th=
e
Emerald Tablet speaks Green politics and ecological salvation.

When I read Peter Lamborn Wilson the horizon opens. There is more light.
Deep into Ancientness and forward towards Utopia his thoughts bring us the
depths & the heights. He Virgils us through the mists of myth & history wit=
h
words Beyond Reason towards Ecstatic Longing.

Kenning Editions is pleased to announce the publication of three new titles=
:
LEFT HAVING by Jesse Seldess, AMBIENT PARKING LOT by Pamela Lu, and INSOMNI=
A
AND THE AUNT by Tan Lin.

-----

LEFT HAVING

Brian Massumi once wrote that the conscious narration of affective states i=
s
subtractive, a retrospective reduction of underlying bodily complexity made
to fit requirements of continuity and linear causality. Sliding away from
the =93continuities=94 of foreclosed presents and enfolded pasts, Jesse Sel=
dess=92
*Left Having* might be read as a *non*-subtractive exploration of the
virtual remainders of such narrations (of historical trauma, of the time of
events, of a person now present in a city or a room=85). Seldess resituates=
 us
=93Beyond the scattered signaling=94 of history =96 in pulse rates that flo=
w
through and across their own fractures and stalls =96 so we can *hear* the
=93Distance just now reaching us*.*=94 These signalings (with gracefully
decaying half tones in them) evoke both the familiarity and strangeness of
durational life. As in the epigraph to the book taken from Alvin Lucier=92s
famous work (in which he records his own =93disfluent=94 speech, playing it=
 back
into the room and re-recording it repeatedly), what can finally be heard in
Seldess=92 writing are the resonant frequencies of the architecture itself.
That architecture=92s =93End=94 (of which Seldess has also produced a video=
 with
artist Leonie Weber) is always ending but never done, because it turns back
into itself (through us) toward something=85else.=96Laura Elrick


One sees lines coming into being going out of existence.  Taken that way,
the words turning toward lines, seeing them become one another as they
differ among themselves and dissipate into words and as spaces, this reader
virtually floats and within this active resting state practices an
incredible intimacy with the unknown in communication and in sharing an
imminent sensate awareness with its language.  Jesse Seldess=92s work perfo=
rms
this book, honoring and taking full advantage of its occasion to replace an=
y
knowing with the certainty of a relentlessly generous nature.  I will never
get to the bottom of it, and this work demonstrates what a pleasure and wha=
t
an honest reckoning that can be.=96Steve Benson


*Left Having* is a virtuoso performance of contending forces: subject and
object, I and you, the will behind utterance and the will of utterance
itself. In these deftly musical poems, language (object) turns into subject=
,
always escaping the speaker=92s will. Seldess takes us on a highly pleasura=
ble
journey into the materiality of semes, but behind the pleasure lies an
urgency: how a hair=92s-breadth difference between two words can translate =
to
chasms of difference in meaning. What if the word were *liable*, what if it
were *reliable*? The slipperiness of the signifier in Seldess=92s inquiry i=
nto
the conditional questions the very routes that events take to unfold. The
brilliant final section is an investigation into the intersection of deixis
and time, the certainty implied by pointing thwarted constantly by the dela=
y
in finding the word=97the act of writing=92s inherent deixis questioned,
challenged. In *Left Having*, Jesse Seldess has given us a magnificent
meditation on utterance itself.=96Donna Stonecipher

AMBIENT PARKING LOT

Part fiction, part earnest mockumentary, *Ambient Parking Lot* follows a
band of musicians as they wander the parking structures of urban downtown
and greater suburbia in quest of the ultimate ambient noise, one that
promises to embody their historical moment and deliver them up to the
heights of their self-important artistry. Along the way, they make sporadic
forays into lyric while contending with doubts, delusions, miscalculations,
mutinies, and minor triumphs. This saga peers into the wreckage of a post
9/11 landscape and embraces the comedy and poignancy of failed utopia.

INSOMNIA AND THE AUNT (available from May 15th, pre-orders accepted and
shipped immediately from www.kenningeditions.com)

Tan Lin=92s *Insomnia and the Aunt* is an ambient novel composed of black a=
nd
white photographs, postcards, Google reverse searches, letters, appendices,
an index to an imaginary novel, re-runs and footnotes. The aunt in question
can=92t sleep. She runs a motel in the Pacific Northwest. She likes watchin=
g
Conan O=92Brien late at night. She may be the narrator=92s aunt or she may =
be an
emanation of a TV set. Structured like everybody=92s scrapbook, and blendin=
g
fiction with non-fictional events, *Insomnia and the Aunt* is about
identities taken and given up, and about the passions of an immigrant life,
rebroadcast as furniture. Ostensibly about a young man=92s disintegrating
memory of his most fascinating relative, or potentially a conceptualist tak=
e
on immigrant literature, it is probably just a treatment for a prime-time
event that, because no one sleeps in motels, lasts into the late night and
daytime slots. Letterpressed covers, handmade chapbook, profusely
illustrated / ISBN: 978-0-9767364-7-9 / $10.00 /

Hi Everyone,

I'm posting the below call for a speaker at the upcoming AWP, in behalf of =
my wife Diane Simmons (multiple award-winning fiction writer, and former sc=
holar). Diane can be reached at DianeSimmons@verizon.net.

Thanks,

Burt


Hello writer friends,

With another writer, I am trying to organize a panel for the Associated Wri=
ting Programs (AWP) conference next winter in Chicago and I'm wondering if =
you might know anyone who would be interested in joining us.

The panel would  be made up of writers using actual letters to inspire crea=
tive projects--fiction, memoir, non-fiction, poetry, or something else.  Si=
nce I have several fiction and non-fiction writers, I would like to add a p=
oet.

We are looking for writers with some publishing track record, but the lette=
rs project could be in progress.

My own work uses World War II letters and letters from the 50s and 60s for =
a memoir/reported non-fiction project having to do, in part, with women in =
war work.   My co-organizer is drawing upon letters written by members of t=
he French Resistance to inspire a short story collection.  Others we are co=
nsidering are using letters from the 1960s.

If you know anyone who might be interested, I would love to hear from them =
or you.

Diane
(DianeSimmons@verizon.net)

Sorry to hear about Anne--her work was sparse, crafted, an "economy of words" but still moving, contained bursts of emotion.

By memory, she was one of maybe five writers we published in the journal more than once, Stroffolino, Tyrone Williams, Sheila Murphy, Julie Otten, Adrianne Kalfopoulou--

never published a collection,
too many on the plate when hers came in.

Be well

Hi everyone! Here's some information about the final performance for a clas=
s
I teach at NYU's Interactive Telecommunication Program. Thought it might be
of interest to readers of the list. -a

---

*Hello Word!*
An evening of poetry, performance, and experimental text design from
NYU/ITP=92s Reading and Writing Electronic Text

Friday, May 6th 2011
7pm
721 Broadway, New York, NY
Ground floor (Common room)
FREE

Over the course of Spring semester, sixteen NYU students have engaged in
intense electro-textual experiments: composing, mangling, generating and
remixing electronic text using the Python programming language. For one
night only, these students will gather to present and perform their
experiments to the general public.

Some examples of projects that may make an appearance at the event: movie
dialogue remixed in real time; dynamic newspaper blackout poetry; an endles=
s
exquisite corpse from Twitter search results; infinite generative creation
myths; and much more.

Reading and Writing Electronic Text is a course offered at NYU=92s
Interactive Telecommunication Program. (http://itp.nyu.edu/itp/). The cours=
e
is an introduction to both the Python programming language and contemporary
techniques in electronic literature. See the syllabus and examples of
student work here: http://rwet.decontextualize.com/

Poetry videos are a new and emerging genre, especially here in Ireland wher=
e anything beyond the text is considered taboo!

Taking inspiration from artists like Caterina Daverino, my poetry video cha=
nnell on youtube features a wise range of poems on all topics, from politic=
al satire to retelling of old legends, from cultures as diverse as Europes =
Romanies, to the Native Americans.

Here is a video I made using my graphic synthesizer dbCinema. It's called
The Club: http://vispo.com/dbcinema/theclub3

The club consists of
    * Ronald Reagan
    * Brian Mulroney
    * Conrad Black
    * Patrick Bateman
    * Jeffrey Dahmer
    * Paul Wolfowitz
    * Dick Cheney
    * Donald Rumsfeld
    * George W. Bush
    * Andrew Fastow
    * Jeffrey Skilling
    * Bernard Ebbers
    * Dennis Kozlowski
    * Joseph Nacchhio
    * Bernie Madoff
    * Stephen Harper
    * Russell Williams

In The Picture of Dorian Gray by Oscar Wilde, "The portrait serves as a
reminder of the effect each act has upon his soul, with each sin displayed
as a disfigurement of his form, or through a sign of aging" (Wikipedia). And
the changes are cumulative, more or less, over different, successive
paintings.

But the transformations of The Club are sometimes not so much "disfigurement
of form" as one fiend randomly yet eventually worsting the previous
(visually/semiotically), taking possession of attention and recognition,
inhabiting the face and growing his own overtop.

What's happening is that two distinct 'brushes' are at work. Each brush has
its own image source (local or net-based). Each brush paints in the shape of
a circle those are the 'brush strokes'. The circles are of low and slightly
variable opacity. The gradient of the mask is radial. So we get inside areas
that are empty but surrounded by paint. So the detail of the transformation
can be quite subtle. Each brush uses an image for 4 seconds. Then it uses
the next image in a set of about 57 images. The other brush is using a
subset of this set of pictures, but also starting perhaps at a different
point. So the combinatorial oomph is fairly high.

The moral character is multiple, as is the psychopath, the politician, and
the CEO. The men in The Club either have a sense of entitlement that is
simply criminal, which covers most of the CEO tycoons and politicians, or
they are under compulsions as ravening beasts, such as (Ex-Colonel) Russell
Williams, Jeffrey Dahmer, and Patrick Bateman of American Psycho--which was
directed by Canadian Mary Harron. Or perhaps both or neither (both as in all
too conveniently supreme sense of entitlement or feeding ravenously,
violently, sexually), something else--there is some variety, here. Cowboy
capitalism of Cormac McCarthy's Blood Meridian.

In American Psycho, Patrick Bateman is with the boys at the bar and sees
Ronald Reagan on television. Bateman--the necessarily compulsive liar--is in
awe of Reagan. "How can he lie like that?" Bateman asks himself, seeing
Reagan as beyond Bateman's own murderous reportoire, range and capacity as a
purveyor of steaming, dangerous mendacities.

Reagan and Reaganonics played a big part in the economic collapse the USA
had been heading toward at least since Ronald Reagan. Deregulation--for the
betterment of business men--or so it was thought--and privatization left a
situation where government no longer funded enough investigators or, as
importantly, as many of the interfacial services between records and
financial activity. Much less data to work with when the services are being
provided privately.

They could almost think they were entitled to the benefits of what they felt
could not be detected, to the nearly invisible paper trails. Vanish in a fog
of numbers.

One of the politicans, Brian Mulroney, a previous Canadian Prime Minister,
has been embroiled for years in a scandal involving his essentially taking
payoffs from a German bussinessman. Mulroney was Reagan's boy.

The criminal CEO's in The Club were, in a sense, the fallout of Reaganomics.
Patrick Bateman is in awe of Reagan's ability to set up the rules to benefit
the rich and to control the massive scale of lies that he spins his people
and the world.

The politicians in The Club are Ronald Reagan, Brian Mulroney, George W.
Bush, Dick Cheney, Paul Wolfowitz, Donald Rumsfeld, and Stephen Harper.
Their dismantling of so many parts of government and payoffs to their
friends, incentives to the rich and diddly squat for the poor portend or
continue a battle in North America for anything even somewhat pleasantly
resembling democracy.

(Ex colonel) Russell Williams ran the largest military airport in Canada in
Canada's armed forces. He was, by all reports, an excellent commander. But
he was convicted of first degree murder in the brutal sex slayings of two
young women, and photographed himself in the womens' underwear he stole from
the houses around his neighbourhood in what looks like over a hundred panty
raids. He had so many boxes of undies that he had to burn some of them but
still had many boxes left.

His connection with the politicians is that he was in a leadership position.
And flew the Queen's plane, yadayada. He walked in the corridors of power.
And fit in undetectably well.

The Club attempts to synthesize the concerns of my favorite politicians,
bussiness men, and serial killers, and to synthesize them, they themselves,
with one another in a streaming of two brushes painting different faces
simultaneously.

Militarism and war is a part of the ideological millieu of The Club. The
Bush administration supported the idea of war against Iraq via
disinformation concerning weapons of mass destruction. Cheney, Wolfowitz and
Bush stuck Colin Powell with the task of presenting and defending this
disinformation before the U.N. Powell trusted the veracity of the
intelligence. He didn't understand they were setting him up in the big lie.
They simply needed the world to get out of their way in their ideological
committment to regime change in Iraq regardless of international
cooperation.

The Bush administration did terrible things to the rule of international law
around the world. The idea being that the USA governs alone and supreme,
when it wants to. This disdain for international law by the national entity
mirrors the disdain of the criminal for law in civil society. At the extreme
end is the psychopath who proceeds mercilessly to dominate, punish, torture,
humiliate and destroy those whom it is convenient and pleasant to persecute
for fun and profit. When two nations are at war, that's basically how one
group treats the other.

This is the link between the politicians in The Club and the psychopaths.

The Club is not only about these individuals but the mentalities they share
that are at play in the broader cultures of the USA and Canada.

Subject:      A gift of poetry for all: Please back up my project
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=ISO-8859-1

Hi, everyone,

I'm turning 34 this year, and instead of asking for gifts, like any normal
human being, I'm writing an enormous homage/serial poem dedicated to all my
friends and family who have been supportive in my first 10 years in poetry.
I'm self-publishing this under no auspice or press and raising funds as well
to press about 300-400 copies which I'll send to all my backers and people I
meet along the way at readings, events and conferences.
I hope you'll help out with the cause, and forward this to your friends and
colleagues. It's a bit selfish to be giving away MY work--why not the work
of another? And in the spirit of homage (and appropriation) each poem will
be composed of lines by numerous poets, dead and alive, with the poet's name
appearing in the acrostic. The impetus? A reading through/of these works,
and a display of reading made evident.

Here's the link. Only 24 days to go!

Subject:      vote rob for this year's poet laureate of the blogosphere;

Again, the poet laureate of the blogosphere contest has begun, and it's up
to you to vote. Since this is the third time I've been up for it, I'm less
excited about another round of potentially not winning (as Bugs Bunny
cries, always the bridesmaid, and never the bride), so not really sure
what to think about it all. Still, here's the posting from the site (to
vote, to go the link, including further links to all the individual nominees);

http://bloggingpoet.squarespace.com/bloggingpoetcom/voting-begins-for-for-the-2011-poet-laureate-of-the-blogosph.html




Voting Begins For For The 2011 Poet Laureate Of The Blogosphere ®

Nominations have ended, I have looked at every nomination that was
presented and found the following poet bloggers all to be eligible to
become the 2011 Poet Laureate Of The Blogosphere ®, a laureateship in name
only but an honor to those who are nominated and the one who will finally
be chosen by his or her fans and followers, who I hope will take the time
to look around at my own poetry and the works of hundreds of other poets
before they leave this site. Below is a list of the poets with names
hyperlinked to their blogs. Below that is the form you can use to cast
your ballots and make the final call.

The Nominees Are:

*Adam Dustus
*Brian Miller
*Fireblossom, aka Shay Caroline
*Gabriel Gadfly
*Jessie Carty
*Joanne Marie Firth
*Jo Janoski
*Leslie Aka Moondustwriter
*Maria Padhila
*MaryAnn McCarra-Fitzpatrick
*Natasha Head
* Neva Flores
*Robert Cameron Hazelton
*Rob Mclennan (why do they insist on upper-casing?)
*Sara Diane Doyle
*Shân Ellis
*Shirley Allard
*Walt Wojtanik
*William Manson

And with that part done I give you the poll which will close on April 29th
at a time of my choosing. If you can't decide you may chose more than one.
The winner will be announced on April 30th, again, at a time of my
choosing.

"A Vow of Poetry" by Mair=E9ad Byrne

from a postcard by Wild Honey Press

Mair=E9ad went into town with her brothers
and sisters one day. There was a funfair in O=92Connell Street
and they all had money in their pockets. Se=E1n went on the orange
and red helter-skelter.  Eamonn played roll-a-penny. Sheila had her =
fortune
told by a chest-high effigy wearing a scarf.  The girls linked arms and =
flounced
up and down the street.  Then they all had candy floss. No-one noticed =
that
Mair=E9ad was missing, but after a while she turned up besides them =
again.  She
had been to the little pitched tent in the center of the street and =
taken a vow
of poverty.  Years later, at one of their regular uproarious gatherings, =
the
brothers and sisters got to talking about this day.  Mair=E9ad mentioned =
her vow
of poverty.  =93A little pitched tent?  I never noticed that,=94 they =
all said. Until
Deirdre remembered: =93Oh no, Mair=E9ad, I know what you=92re talking =
about.  That
wasn=92t poverty, that was poetry!=94  =93Oh,=94 said Mair=E9ad, =93I =
assumed the v was
hidden in the fold of the canvas.  What a mistake!  I feel such a fool =
to have
remained poor all these years!  And all the time it was poetry!=94=

In your first pair of shoes

For a kiss and a hug.
No surprise I admit=20

Like the hands of the clock
Till I want to cry "stop!"
But I know that's not right

May 1st, 5th & 6th

The Durutti Skool & Red Rover Series
would like to invite you to take part in a series of events
concerning poetry, social existence, Marxism and Anarchism

Our main concern is to join in the greater conversation occurring around th=
e country at other Durutti Skools this year about poetry itself as a cataly=
st for social change.  The idea for the skools began last summer when a gro=
up of poets met in Berkeley, California as part of the 95 Cent Skool. All p=
articipants were invited to form their own skools in order to continue the =
conversation and encourage poets to connect more strongly with their commun=
ities and ideas about writing, community, and change.

************************************************************
SUNDAY, MAY 1st
Poetry for Labor:
A May Day reading & celebration
Guest curated by John Keene
9am-12pm @ the Haymarket Square

POETRY FOR LABOR is a free, public, participatory reading to celebrate the =
125th Anniversary of the Haymarket Square Affair in 1886, one of the signal=
 events in US and global labor history, and the struggles of workers in the=
 US and worldwide.  All participants are welcome.  Bring your own poem or p=
oems, poems or prose by writers you love, short autobiographical pieces, or=
 any text that brings to life, in celebration, in reflection, in commemorat=
ion, work and those who do it. Come out and read, recite and perform your p=
oems!

JOHN KEENE teaches at Northwestern University and is fully or partly respon=
sible for two books, and many drawings and translations, more of which are =
on their way.

THURSDAY, MAY 5th
Chicago Durutti Skool: Workshop
with the Next Objectivists
7-9pm @ Mess Hall

THE NEXT OBJECTIVISTS is a free, open-to-the-public poetry workshop dedicat=
ed to the study & reproduction of the outsidereal. We take this term from t=
he "Black Mountain" poet Edward Dorn & our name from the second generation =
modernist poets associated with The Objectivist Press. Although writers ass=
ociated with the Objectivists and Black Mountain "schools" (Bunting, Creele=
y, H.D., Niedecker, Pound, Reznikoff, Williams, Zukofsky to name only those=
 we've already studied) are prominent stars in our constellation, our objec=
tive is not to reproduce any particular style, mode or tradition, but inste=
ad to draw on many different ways of doing and making in order to isolate t=
hose practices of writing & publishing & above all those poetic effects whi=
ch lead us out of the neoliberal present & the future it imagines.

The Next Objectivists Poetry Workshop was founded in January 2009.   Member=
s make the curriculum as we go along. Our meetings are potlucks and beginne=
rs are always welcome. We read, discuss & write poetry together. As time al=
lows we publish our findings through our website: http://nextobjectivists.b=
logspot.com

LOCATION:
Mess Hall, 6932 North Glenwood Avenue

FRIDAY, MAY 6th
Chicago Durutti Skool: Readings & Discussions
with Frank Rogaczewski & Michelle Taransky
7-9pm @ Outer Space Studio

What is the role of poetry and the poet in addressing and engaging social a=
wareness?

 University of Illinois at Chicago and teaches in the MFA Program at Roosev=
elt University in Chciago. He lives in Berwyn with his wife Beverly Stewart=
. "Fate of Humanity" was released by American Letters and Commentary in Fal=
l 2009. Poet Mark Nowak describes the book well: "Straight from the near we=
st suburbs of Sandburgland, Frank Rogaczewski explodes the less than brave =
new world we=E2=80=99ve unfortunately arrived at. The Fate of Humanity in V=
erse sears through the vast gaps of capitalism and pop culture in multi-pag=
e paragraphs of pure invention. It is quite simply, to borrow two of Rogacz=
ewski=E2=80=99s titles, an =E2=80=9CArse Poetica=E2=80=9D for =E2=80=9CThe =
Day They Outsourced America.=E2=80=9D
