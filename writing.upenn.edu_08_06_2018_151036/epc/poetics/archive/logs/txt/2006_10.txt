You mean, 'why it is necessary to read gertrude stein in context,' don't you?  Isn't this form of "revision" a form of ahistorical "expression"?  It's one thing to point out how poorly interpreted Stein continues to be (see, for example, _Legitimate Dangers_), but another to reappropriate the disfunctional circuit through which sh*t sheds stink.

*"Around us, everything is writing; that's what we must perceive. Everything
is writing. It's the unknown in oneself, one's head, one's body. Writing is
not even a reflection, but a kind of faculty one has, that exists to one
side of oneself, parallel to oneself: another person who appears and comes
forward, invisible, gifted with thought and anger, and who sometimes,
through her own actions, risks losing her life. Into the night."

David,

Your "speculative" interpretation "done for
amusement"--is delightful.  For one thing, it's
wonderful how you bring in those Bibical stories of
gambling.

Lacking, at this point in my life, much erudition
regarding Pascal or philosophy in general, I would
like to say, though, that at least one moment in
Pascal's "wager" discussion *does* strike me as very
deep--that is when he discsses the very wide gap
between what is conceived of by Belief and by
Non-Belief as an "infinite chaos" (here in the
apparently awkward translation by someone named
Trotter you can find on the web--a 1910 translation
that's in the Public Domain):

 Let us then examine this point, and say, "God is, or
He is not." But to which side shall we incline? Reason
can decide nothing here. There is an infinite chaos
which separated us. A game is being played at the
extremity of this infinite distance where heads or
tails will turn up. What will you wager?
____________________
What's deep, of course, is that the distance between
the two basic options regarding the matter of theism
vs. atheism becomes a scary wild distance like the
terrifying cosmic distances Pascal famously wrote of:
"The eternal silence of these infinite spaces
terrifies me."

I imagine this has been much discussed in the
secondary literature on Pascal.

But think of how this applies to, for instance,
poetics and politics.  What did Joan Houlihan and Ron
Silliman say to each other over their almost-infinite
poetical distance? (I think I read something in Ron's
blog recently about their having dinner together,
unless I was dreaming).  How can people with very
different mindsets about, say, the Israeli/Palestinian
struggle say anything to each other about that matter?


There's no quick fix akin to getting into a Ford
Galaxie to cross the universe (as in Jean Luc Godard's
"Alphaville" in which you'll recall there's also a
voice-over quoting Pascal on the "infinite spaces").

David,

This is an absolutely fascinating post, in relation both to what you say
about Pascal and outsider art.

As you point out, the "outsider" is a mental, intellectual source of energy
with multiple aspects, including geography, tradition, etc. Poetry itself
has "outside" influences, as in art, beyonf "tradition"
("avant,""post-avant,"without an "outside," etc.).

Ciao,

Murat

You must all first hear the tale:

Robert Creddens was born in a small Texas town to parents who would =
always be strangers to him.  He was adopted as an infant into a rural =
Texas dysfunctional family.  In his late teen years, Robert's adopted =
parents had him committed to an asylum because of his homosexual antics =
(it was a football team tale back then, and interestingly, none of the =
football team members were singled out).

Robert found himself released from the asylum to the custody of a caring =
(equally gay) physician who took the lad in and abused him for the next =
several years.=20

Demonstrating true human tenacity, Robert survived that relationship and =
via a long trip ended up in Los Angeles where he worked for a decade or =
more before he escaped to the Seattle area, where he lived until his =
quiet death a few years ago. =20

Robert's escape device was film and television.  And he created VCR's of =
much of what he viewed.=20

I am the recipient of Robert's library of VCRs.  It is an impressive =
library.  I estimate (I have not actually counted, yet) 100 VHS VCRs of =
the following quality:

Elia Kazan's  "America America" 1963
Alfred Hitchcock's "Spellbound" 1945
Humphrey Bogart, Ava Gardner "The Barefoot Contessa" 1954=20
Shadow of a Doubt 1943
All About Eve 1950
Better Davis, Claude Rains, "Deception" 1946...notes by Robert Creddens: =
"Horror Movies"=20
Sharon Tate, Barbara Parkins "Valley of the Dolls" =20

And Robert watched TV and made VCRs:
Foreign Correspondent
Richard Avedon American Masters "Darkness & Light"  & John Mayceri Plays =
Tiomkin "Great Performances" =20

These are all first copy VCRs, and they would make marvelous additions =
to any Film School's library collection.=20

I will ship them (at my cost) to a school or library interested in =
creating a "Robert Creddens" Collection.=20

Don't waste my time if all you want is a copy of Dr. Strange Love (yes, =
there is one) for your viewing pleasure.=20

Backchannel, please.

High Energy Constructs, Los Angeles, presents "Many Happy Returns" - a group
exhibition that centers around the intersections of
poetry/literature/language and the visual/media arts. The exhibition will
run from October 21 - November 25, 2006, with an opening reception on
Saturday, October 21, 2006, 6-9 pm, featuring a special store-front window
performance by Juliacks, and music by Ben Bigelow, entitled: Maybell
Explorer of the Overgrown Garden..

Evoking the field(s) of verbal and visual interplay in art since the 1960s,
"Many Happy Returns" offers a vibrant look at collaborative relations,
radical creations, and hermetic disciplines that have proven to reflect and
affect social, political, and artistic currents via traditional and
counter-traditional expressions - in continuation with the likes of William
Blake, Walt Whitman, Dada, Fluxus, the Beat and New York School Generations.


Participants of this exhibition include celebrated poets and other
influential figures in America's literary milieu, contemporary visual
artists, filmmakers, bookmakers, printers, and other media artists. Via
collage, video, painting, photography, installation, drawing, books, and
other printed matter, the exhibition aims to bring together a unique array
of individual and collective artworks that come out of literary communities.
Named after Ted Berrigan's 1969 book-length poem, "Many Happy Returns" mixes
today's bards and artists with the superceded ghosts of America's last
avant-garde, in hopes of updating and highlighting the innovative collisions
that take place between art and language.

Lectures

Joel Nickels on Literature as Hypnosis: Laura Riding’s Critique of Modernism

Friday, October 6, 2006 at 7:30 p.m.

Nickels writes: “Among contemporary experimental poets, Laura Riding enjoys a
measure of celebrity, in part because she is thought of as an ‘anti-systemic’
poet, in part because of her attempts to disperse writerly authority by
calling attention to the instability of the linguistic sign. For these
reasons, Riding is sometimes even considered a precursor to postmodern
poetries that are defined by their attention to the ‘materiality of the
signifier.’ In this talk I’ll provide a critical introduction to Riding’s
poetics, focusing on what it can teach us about the methods and
self-understandings of contemporary experimental writing. Central to my
investigation will be Riding’s relentless critique of modernism. Although she
helped canonize many of the authors we now think of as ‘modernist’ in her 1927
A Survey of Modernist Poetry, Riding also provided one of the earliest, and
most conceptually rich, indictments of modernism’s epistemologies and
political presuppositions. In works such as Anarchism Is Not Enough, The
Telling, and The Word ‘Woman’ and Other Writings, Riding claims that the
modernist ideals of authorial impersonality and formal experimentation are
unconsciously derived from a capitalist public sphere characterized by
economic anonymity, gratuitous innovation, and the inability to regulate
social production. More than this, she claims that modernism’s attempts to
evoke the possibility of social change through literary modes of linguistic
repatterning merely mirror the workings of ideology, in which the illusion of
free choice is generated within a structure that is completely administered
from above. Riding’s critique, therefore, signals a crisis not merely in
modernism’s claims to be ‘anti-systemic,’ but also in contemporary writing
that accords anti-systemic significance to poetic bricolage, parataxis, and
the ‘free play’ of linguistic signification. By positing a poetic agent who is
everywhere and nowhere, who drifts impartially through social space, and who
translates intuitions of political possibility into carefully orchestrated
formal disjunctions, such poetries, she claims, merely reaffirm the logic of
commodity-exchange and pseudo-democratic social hypnosis. But what resources
are left, then, for those of us who still hope to find a place for political
exploration and dissent in imaginative writing? By exploring Riding’s poetry
and prose, with special attention to her long, strange epistolary
collaboration, The World and Ourselves, I propose a few new answers to this
question. They stem from Riding’s distinctions between disembedded vs.
embedded poetic subjectivities, experimental vs. reciprocal modes of
composition, and overproductionist vs. proportionate social economies. By
revisiting these conceptual distinctions, which were born of the aesthetic and
political crises of the 1930s, I aim to resuscitate one of the earliest and
most powerful critiques of modernism, and ask to what extent it may be used to
interrogate the forms of impersonalist, disembedded epistemology that are
still at work in some contemporary writing.”

Joel Nickels is a doctoral candidate at U. C. Berkeley, where he teaches
English composition. He is currently completing a dissertation on the
relationship between modernism’s models of creative production and its
figurations of political agency. He has served as editor of the
interdisciplinary journal, Qui Parle, and founded the Townsend Center working
group, Phenomenology Now. At the moment, he’s also commuting to Fremont and
San Francisco to teach high school enrichment classes in writing and critical
thought.

From Jonathan Penton (and I):

We at www.UnlikelyStories.org would like to observe:

1. All creativity comes from the same stream. The distinctions between visu=
al
art, literature, music, film, performance art, and technologically-assisted
art are artificial.

2. Although these distinctions are artificial, they are often practical. It
is extremely expensive to bind many pieces of visual art in a book, and oft=
en
greatly reduces the emotional impact of such works. It is rarely convenient
to view the original manuscript of a well-loved novel.

3. Although some practical distinctions are still valid, recent technologic=
al
changes have greatly reduced their necessity. With the advent of
consumer-level laser printers, visual art can be reproduced much less
expensively. Similar technologies have reduced the cost of short printing
runs. The television, the VCR, and most importantly the Internet, have
allowed for vastly greater distribution of artworks of all types. Although
problems of finance and location are still acute, the opportunities to
distribute a wide variety of artistic works to a larger audience are greatly
increased.

4. Unfortunately, the mindset of artists, and to a lesser degree art
appreciators, has not caught up with these changes. We still see a
photographer as different from a painter and a filmmaker as different from a
poet to a degree which is not justified by the differing technical skills.
Worse, photography is considered inherently different from painting, and
poetry inherently different from film, despite the fact that all four are
often given quite similar electronic treatments to enhance their
presentation, especially on the Internet.

We at www.UnlikelyStories.org will proudly present our Cross-Media Issue in
the hopes of working to alter these prejudices in both our own minds and the
culture. Under the guiding vision of experimental artist and guest editor D=
an
Waber, we are looking to publish creative works which push the boundaries of
not simply genre, but medium. We are looking for works that destroy the
boundaries between poetry and visual art, between music and essay, between
storytelling and programming. We are looking to dance about literature.

We are especially interested in works which would not be possible without t=
he
World Wide Web, or that otherwise are designed to specifically take advanta=
ge
of the medium in which they will be presented. We are looking for essays and
reviews of any cross-media work, as well as essays that explore current
changes in art as our technology and culture change. We are looking for
experiments =E2=80=93 music videography and prose poetry are too well estab=
lished to
be considered cross-media, unless, of course, you've painted a music video =
or
photographed a prose poem.

The bulk of this issue will remain at www.UnlikelyStories.org in perpetuity,
although large files might be taken down after one year. It should be noted
that cross-media works are also accepted in regular issues of Unlikely 2.0,
though the considerations for acceptance are drastically different. Please
see http://www.unlikelystories.org/mission.shtml for our Mission Statement,
and the guidelines that pertain to unthemed issues.

Considerations for interested artists:

1. Please take the time to check out www.UnlikelyStories.org and see what we
normally do at Unlikely 2.0.
2. Please send your work, or links to your work, directly to Dan Waber at=20
unlikelystories@gmail.com. Submissions must be received by Friday, December
22, 2006. The issue should go live in mid-January.
3. Please assume that all work will be viewed in Internet Explorer or Firef=
ox
at 1024x768 pixels. The sidebars that normally exist on Unlikely 2.0 will be
removed when appropriate.
4. Please create works that can be reasonably viewed by users running Windo=
ws
2000 on a Pentium III, Windows XP on a Pentium 4, or Mac OS 8.x. Movie
formats that are viewable on the Web are unfortunately harder on computers
than are DVDs. Realistically, a movie file shouldn't be larger than 400x300
pixels, and an animated file shouldn't be larger than 600x400 pixels.
5. Previously published works are accepted, with appropriate notation.
Simultaneously submitted materials are not appropriate for this issue.

The EMERGENCY Series Presents
Sarah Dowling and Jena Osman
Thursday | October 12 | 6pm-7pm
Kelly Writers House | 3805 Locust Walk
University of Pennsylvania

What does it mean to be an emerging poet in America today? Does Dana Gioia's
claim that "poetry has vanished as a cultural force in America" ring true for
poets at the cutting edge of literary production? Does today's emerging poet
face increasing isolation and shrinking audiences, or is a quiet renaissance
taking place, one centered around close-knit communities, long-distance
mentorships, new media, and chapbook exchange? How are theoretical stances and
aesthetic practices transmitted among poets at different stages in their
careers? The Emergency Series at Kelly Writers House seeks to answer these
questions, highlighting perspectives on the current state of American poetry
through the diverse experiences of its practicing poets. By bringing together
emerging and established poets for readings and discussions, it aims to create
an ongoing dialogue about the role poetic lineage plays in a poet's
development, and its impact on the vitality of the craft.

SARAH DOWLING is originally from Regina, Saskatchewan, and lives in
Philadelphia. She recently completed an M.A. in creative writing at Temple
University and is currently a doctoral student at the University of
Pennsylvania. Her work has previously appeared or is forthcoming in How2,
Descant, In/Vision, Taproot II, and The Mitre.

JENA OSMAN's most recent book of poems is An Essay in Asterisks (Roof Books,
2004). Her book The Character (Beacon Press, 1999) was the winner of the 1998
Barnard New Woman Poets Prize. Other publications include Jury (Meow Press),
Amblyopia (Avenue B), and Twelve Parts of Her (Burning Deck Press). In 2006,
she was awarded the Pew Fellowship in the Arts for poetry. Osman received an
M.A. in poetry and playwriting from Brown University, and a Ph.D. in English
from the Poetics Program at the State University of New York at Buffalo. She is
the director of the creative writing program at Temple University.

For those within striking range of St. Louis, MO...

Observable Readings presents its first all-Korean, all Francophone evening:


RAY HSU, originally from Toronto, Canada, now of Madison, WI... author of
"Anthropy" (2005) ... described by the Toronto Star as "brainy and
eclectic"... "Signs lean like blank, stupid trees. / The engine is a heart,
/ A handful of nails."

FRANCOIS LUONG, originally from Strasbourg, France, now living in Houston,
TX... author of reams of erotic love poetry, editor of "Melancholia's
Tremulous Dreadlocks"...  "sanity is the life in the silence of hammers /
falling against windowpanes" ...

These poets have traveled over 1,200 miles to read poetry to YOU!!  Please
help us in welcoming them to the austere beauty of Schlafly Bottleworks in
Maplewood at 8 PM on Thursday, October 5th. This is a FREE reading!
Directions and other information are available at
http://observable.org/readings/


. . . . . . .

"'Anthropy' is anthropology remade in the freewheeling, crisply detached
style of postmodernism... Hsu's work resembles that of Anne Carson, the
celebrated Montreal writer and classics scholar who combines cultural
references to the ancient world with a cool (in both senses of the word)
contemporary voice. Brainy and eclectic... The pleasures of Anthropy lie in
watching an inventive mind excavate public history and private life for
lessons about memory, identity and progress... Tantalizing and
thought-provoking."  --The Toronto Star

I was talking to a friend about Chaplin the other day, and he recalled
seeing an old issue of what he thought was 'transition' where a group of
surrealists including Breton had penned a manifesto-type letter in support
of Chaplin after he had been charged with sodomy by his underage
bride.anyone out there know where we might find this manifesto-letter? I did
the usual internet / library searches, and don't have immediate access to
copies of 'transition,' and he wasn't sure if it was in 'transition' in the
first place.



If you know the source, I'd greatly appreciate a pointer! You can
backchannel me at dkane@panix.com

I think it is reprinted in Maurice Nadeau's "Histoire du surrealisme,"
as well as in the (abridged) English version by Richard Howard.

As a footnote -- and a sign of how Chaplin's star had faded for the
most radical French avant-gardists, there's also the Internationale
Lettriste's (1951, I think) attack on Chaplin when "Limelight" was
premiered at the Cannes Film Festival.  "Go home, Mister Chaplin" was
the concluding sentence.

Out now, the first issue of H_NGM_N's new print magazine COMBATIVES!

Each issue features a large selection of poems by one poet (or two poets
working together, as in the case of the forthcoming #3)! Our first
offering is BRETT PRICE.

Go to http://hngmn.squarespace.com/combatives/ for more information.

Vol. 1 of this mag will run for 6 issues - each issue is only $2 (simply
to help cover the cost of shipping) & & & when you order an issue, I'll
send you up to 3 copies. Pass them around, leave them on subways,
whatever.  You can also use PayPal to order a subscription to all 6
issues for $10.

We're trying to get back to basics, putting our shoulders to the wheel,
hiding under boot soles, bowing & passing smiling in our cars. Really,
we want everyone to read this work, to talk about it, blog about, weep
over it.

Here's the kicker - it's stapled down the side so you know it's good!

Yrs--

Against all sane and sage advice, Jennifer Mulligan and I (with much help
from very many other people) have started an Ottawa-based literary
publishing house. Founded to focus on material by Ottawa-area writers,
we're starting with poetry and fiction, and hope to soon move into
non-fiction in a town infamous for being overrun with writers, but with an
equally infamous lack of local attention from media.

Our website is due up next week, but we have information on our first
event in Ottawa on October 26th, as the ottawa international writers
festival helps us launch new titles by Clare Latremouille, Meghan Jackson and
Monty Reid here:

--------------------------------------------

Above the world-weary horizons
         New obstacles for exchange arise
         Or unfold,
         O ye postmasters!


         1. About the Poetics List

With the preceding epigraph, the Poetics Listserv          was founded
by Charles Bernstein in late 1993. Now in its fourth incarnation,
    the list has about 1300 subscribers worldwide. We also have a
substantial          number of nonsubscribing readers, who access the
list through our web          site (see archive URL above).

The Poetics List is not a forum for a general discussion          of
poetry or for the exchange of poems. Our aim is to support, inform,
      and extend those directions in poetry that are committed to
innovations,          renovations, and investigations of form
and/or/as content, to the questioning          of received forms and
styles, and to the creation of the otherwise unimagined,
untried, unexpected, improbable, and impossible. While we recognize
that          other lists may sponsor other possibilities for
exchange, we request that          those participating in this forum
keep in mind the specialized and focused          nature of this
project and respect our decision to operate a moderated          list.
The Poetics List exists to support and encourage divergent points
    of view on innovative forms of modern and contemporary poetry and
poetics,          and we are committed to do what is necessary to
preserve this space for          such dialog.

Due to the high number of subscribers, we no longer          maintain
the open format with which the list began (at under 100 subscribers).
        The specific form of moderation that we employ is a relatively
fluid one:          in most cases, messages are reviewed after having
been posted to the list,          and difficulties resolved on that
basis; however, the listserv editorial          board may shift
between this and a pre-review mode which calls for all
messages to be read and approved before being forwarded to the list.
We          prefer to avoid this option as it hampers the spontaneity
of discussion          that we hope to promote. In addition to these
options, the editorial board          will unsubscribe individuals if
they are not, in our opinion, productively          contributing to
the list or following our guidelines. We remain committed          to
this editorial function as a defining element of the Poetics List.

Please also note that this is a private list and          information
about this list should not be posted to other lists or directories
     of lists. The idea is to keep the list membership to those with
specific          rather than general interests, and also to keep the
scale of the list          relatively small and the volume manageable.
The current limits of the          list are generally 50 messages per
day, and one or two messages per subscriber          per day; but
these limits are subject to change withouth notice.

In addition to being archived at through the EPC
(http://epc.buffalo.edu) and at
http://listserv.acsu.buffalo.edu/archives/poetics.html,          some
posts to Poetics (especially reviews, obituary notices, announcements,
         etc.) may also become part of specific EPC subject areas.

Note also that Roof Books published Joel Kuszai's          edited
collection of the Poetics List; this is available from          ROOF
and also on line          at the EPC.


2. Posting to the List

The Poetics List is a moderated list. All messages          are
reviewed by the editors in keeping with the goals of the list as
articulated          in this Welcome Message (see section 1).

Please note that while this list is primarily concerned          with
discussions of poetry and poetics, messages relating to politics
   and political activism, film, art, media, and so forth are also
welcome.          We strongly encourage subscribers to post
information, including web links,          relating to publications
(print and internet), reading series, and blogs          that they
have coordinated, edited, published, or in which they appear.
Such announcements constitute a core function of this list. Brief
reviews          of poetry events and publications (print or digital)
are always welcome.

We do not accept postings of creative work not          directed
toward a discussion of poetics issues on the list. The Poetics
 List is not a venue for the posting of free-standing, personal poems
or          journal entries.

Also, please note that the Poetics List is not a "chat" list and we
discourage the posting of  very short messages intended for only a few
subscribers.

Subscribers only may post to the Poetics List.          Send messages
directly to the list address: poetics@listserv.buffalo.edu.


         3. Subscriptions

*For all subscription requests go to
http://listserv.acsu.buffalo.edu/archives/poetics.html.

*To subscribe for the first time click on "Subscribe          (join) a
List." Immediately following your subscription to the poetics
listserv we ask that you email poetics@buffalo.edu, subject-line
"registration,"          with your full name, street address, email
address, and telephone number.          Failure to register at the
time of subscription will result in automatic          deletion from
the subscription roll.

*To manage your subscription (for descriptions          of the
different subscription options please see section 3), click on
 "Subscriber's Corner."

Subscriptions to the Poetics List are free of charge,          but
formal registration is required. All other questions about
subscriptions,          whether about an individual subscription or
subscription policy, should          be addressed to this same
administrative address.

PLEASE NOTE: All subscription-related information          and
correspondence remains absolutely confidential.

All posts to the list must provide your full real          name, as
registered. If there is any discrepancy between your full name
 as it appears in the "from" line of the message header, please
  sign your post at the bottom. Subscribers who do not include their
full          name with each post will be unsubscribed form the list.

The most frequent problem with subscriptions is          bounced
messages. If your system is often down or if you have a low disk
   quota, Poetics messages may get bounced, which will result in your
subscription          being automatically terminated by the Listserv
program and the automatically          generated message telling you
that this has occurred will also likely          bounce. If this
happens, you may re-subscribe to the list by the same          process
described above. One remedy to avoid this happening in the future:
     set your list options to "no-mail" and read the list on the
   web.

4. Subscription Options

We encourage you to alter your subscription options          via the
link on the right side of the screen at
http://listserv.acsu.buffalo.edu/archives/poetics.html.          If
you would prefer not to use the web-interface, you may also email
<listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu>          the following commands:

*to subscribe to the Poetics listserv send
listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu          this one-line message with no
"subject": sub poetics [your Firstname          and Lastname]

*RECOMMENDED: if you wish to read the list on our          web
interface and not receive any messages sent directly, while remaining
        subscribed to the list and so eligible to send us posts, send
this one-line          message to <listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu> with
no "subject":          set poetics nomail. Note: this option is also
useful for temporary suspension          of email service.

*to reactivate Poetics e-mail send <listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu>
     this one-line message with no "subject": set poetics mail

* to receive the list in digest form (you will          receive the
day's individual posts in one email sent just after midnight
EST), send <listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu> this one-line message
   with no "subject": set poetics digest

*to receive posts in the default option (you will          receive
individual postings immediately), send <listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu>
         this one- line message with no "subject": set poetics
nodigest

* to receive the list in index form (you will receive          a list,
without the text of the posts, of the subjects discussed each
day along with the author's name and address and the number of lines
it          comprises; you can also choose to have the index sent to
you in either          plain text or in HTML format with hyperlinks),
send <listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu>          this one-line message
with no "subject": set poetics nohtml          index --or-- set
poetics html index

PLEASE NOTE: do not leave your Poetics subscription          in
default or digest mode if you are going to be away for any extended
      period of time. Your account may become flooded and you may lose
Poetics          messages as well as other important mail. In such
cases, switch your subscription          to "nomail" as recommended
above.

5. To Unsubscribe

To unsubscribe (or change any of your subscription          options),
again, we strongly encourage you to go to the right-hand side
of the screen at
http://listserv.acsu.buffalo.edu/archives/poetics.html          You
may also may unsubscribe by sending a one-line email to
<listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu>          with no "subject": unsub
poetics

If you are having difficulty unsubscribing, please          note:
sometimes your e-mail address may be changed slightly by your system
       administrator. If this happens you will not be able to send
messages to          Poetics or to unsubscribe, although you will
continue to receive mail          from the Poetics List. To avoid this
problem, unsub using your old address,          then resubscribe with
your new email address.


6. Cautions

"Flame" messages will not be tolerated            on the Poetics List.
We define 'flaming' as any post that resembles a            personal
attack or personal insult to anyone--subscriber or not. This
 of course includes racist, sexist, or other slurs as well as ad
hominem arguments in which            the person rather than their
work is attacked; in other words while critique            of a
person's work is welcome (critical inquiry is one of the main
functions            of the list), this critique cannot extend to a
critique or criticism of            the person.

The listserv is intended to be a productive communal space for
discussion and announcements; as such, subscribers who do not follow
listserv policy will be removed from the subscription roll.

In enforcing this policy, the editors must consider sometimes
competing interests. The basis for our decisions, however, rests with
our collective judgment about the kind of space we want for the list.

For reasons of basic security, we do not allow
pseudonymous subscriptions. All messages intended for the Poetics List
                 should be sent in Text-Only format, without
attachments. We do not accept                  HTML-formatted messages
or attached files. As a general rule, keep individual          posts
to 1,000 words or less.

Please do not publish list postings without the          express
permission of the author. Posting on the list is a form of
publication.          Copyright for all material posted on Poetics
remains with the author;          material from this list and its
archive may not be reproduced without          the author's
permission, beyond the standard rights accorded by "fair          use"
of published materials.

All material on the Poetics List remains the property          of the
authors; before you reproduce this material, in whole or in part,
    we ask that you get permission (by email is fine) from the
authors. If          they give permission, then we ask only that you
say that the post or posts          appeared originally on the Poetics
List (http://epc.buffalo.edu/poetics/welcome.html)          on [give
date and say:] Used by permission of the author.

As an outside maximum, we will accept no more than          2 messages
per day from any one subscriber. Also, given that our goal          is
a manageable list (manageable both for moderators and subscribers),
      the list accepts 50 or fewer messages per day.

Like all systems, the listserv will sometimes be          down: if you
feel your message has been delayed or lost, *please wait          at
least one day to see if it shows up*, then check the archive to be
     sure the message is not posted there; if you still feel there is
a problem,          you may wish to contact the editors at
<poetics@acsu.buffalo.edu>.

THE BE BLANK CONSORT

Sheila E. Murphy (Phoenix), John M. Bennett (Columbus, OH), Scott Helmes
(Minneapolis, MN), and K.S. Ernst (NJ) will perform as the BE BLANK CONSORT
in Prescott, AZ with innovative and improvisational poetry.

..:::::A statement from the poets:::::..
THE BE BLANK CONSORT was born in June 2001 at the Atlantic Center for the
Arts (New Smyrna Beach, Florida) when all of its members were part of a
literary residency convened by Richard Kostelanetz. We are all writers, but
we all use language in greatly expanded and often completely new ways and
contexts. THE CONSORT was formed to perform various kinds of texts and
visual texts, many of them created collaboratively, in ways that would
reveal new resonances and possibilities in them. Some of the pieces are
poems written by one of us and scored for multiple voices by another. A few
are entirely written and scored by one person. Many more were written in
collaboration between two or more of the performers and others. Scott
Helmes, in January 2002, initiated the first poems specifically designed fo=
r
performance by THE CONSORT and many have followed since, created by all the
members. THE CONSORT has performed numerous times in Miami, New York,
Columbus, Minneapolis, and other venues, and has released a CD, SOUND MESS:
+ OTHER POEMS.

Much of K.S. (Kathy) Ernst's visual poetry is painted, collaged, or digital=
.
In addition, she uses three-dimensional letters in freestanding sculptures.
She was born in St. Louis, MO, but spent most of her life about an hour fro=
m
New York City.

John M. Bennett has exhibited and performed his word art worldwide, and has
published over 200 books of poetry; among the most recent are LA M AL (Blue
Lion Press) and CANTAR DEL HUFF (Luna Bisonte Prods). He is Curator of the
Avant Writing Collection at the Ohio State University Libraries.

Sheila E. Murphy is the author of numerous books of poetry, most recently
CONTINUATIONS (collaboration with Douglas Barbour) from The University of
Alberta Press. Her home is in Phoenix.

Scott Helmes's professional activities have been mainly in the fields of
architecture and education. Starting in 1972, he began writing experimental
poetry and pursuing mail art activities and artistic printmaking/drawings.
His writing archive from 1972 to 1997 is in the Avant Writing Collection of
the Ohio State University Libraries.

Romanian-born German writer Oskar Pastior dies at 78
The Associated Press

Published: October 5, 2006

E_BKS_Germany_Obit_Pastior.php


BERLIN Oskar Pastior, a Romanian-born German writer who was
celebrated for his creative use of language, has died, his publisher
said Thursday. He was 78.

Pastior died overnight in Frankfurt, where he was visiting the annual
book fair, said Christine Knecht, a spokeswoman for the Carl Hanser
Verlag publishing house. She did not give the cause of death.

Among Pastior's early works was "Offne Worte" published in 1964; he
made his literary debut in Germany in 1969 with "Vom Sichersten ins
Tausendste," a collection of poems.

Pastior was born on Oct. 20, 1927 in the Transylvanian city of Sibiu,
where he lived as a member of the German-speaking minority.

After being interned in Soviet labor camps following World War II, he
returned to communist Romania in 1949 and studied German at the
University of Bucharest. He worked in radio before turning to writing.

Pastior fled to West Germany during a study trip to Vienna, Austria
in 1968 and settled in West Berlin. He had been working on a book
about his time in Soviet labor camps at the time of his death.

Germany's culture minister, Bernd Neumann, described Pastior as "one
of the most significant authors of our time."

"His virtuoso linguistic art is a pleasure but also a challenge for
the reader," Neumann said in a statement. "Great seriousness and a
passion for the word were evident in his playful linguistic
experiments."

Details of survivors and funeral arrangements were not immediately
available.

RIGHT NOW THE MUSIC AND THE LIFE RULE
<http://www.lulu.com/content/407551>(Hathaway, 2006), a new collection
of vignettes by the author of TRACT
(Dusi-e/chap, 2006) is once again available to the public ($9.75).

Many of the most alluring Euro types cameo in Leon's addition to the
transgressive compendium. Look at this piece of his diary. :::

Two girls I knew, one a painter, and one an obese seductress began fingering
one another in my bedroom the night of the Southcoast Soiree. I had Keystone
remove them from the premises. From the boudoir I could hear my name. I
allowed them back into the pool party under the condition they perform atop
a float in the water for all to view and possibly participate. Several of my
distinguished guests penetrated the couple. I stood by and watched with
benign curiosity. Many times I had fucked in groups and was by that time
quite disenchanted. Later that evening I was accosted in the street by a
gentleman named Ethan. He said to me, "You're not really a writer, *I'm* a
writer." Then I walked to the newsstand to read the latest reviews of my
work.

I bought a hotel building on Liberty Street. We named the place The
Commodore. I accepted to allow 60% of the rooms residence priority. The
whole organization moved in. Around this time the counter-culture was
bemoaning its loss of all credibility. They acknowledged finally that hip
meant being able to buy things. Hipsters were just the mainstream with
brighter costumes. I went so far left as to prohibit any variation of the
dress code in The Commodore. All music was disallowed except what we played
through the stereo in every room and hallway. That was mostly Phil Collins.
Everyone loved it of course. Fortunately we were still cool, but less
neo-bohemian, more Helmsley.

a silly question - -

so what happens after you've assigned each poet a "player"?  what is the
purpose of it?

you can reply to my personal email if you wish.

In the literary world of today there are winners and losers. A lot of the
old losers like Baudelaire have become winners and likewise a lot of the
winners today will become losers. But what about the extreme losers of
today's ripe world of total literature? What will they become? Will they
become old losers who are never winners? The immediate writing from the
loser set is oft perceived by the losers to be a supreme act of
litero-historico impact. The belief that to fight a good fight will actually
bring about the success of the good. But what is this tendency toward the
success of the pure goodness but a complete vanity of the most ambitious
contrariness. How wild is it that a one-time loser rises to the glory
position of total win? The old present-tense loser peers will look on in awe
firstly and then conversely in contempt, as they occupy the ambiguous
territory of "what about today's losers." A question no one can answer. Many
poignant writers of our time like Morrissey have attempted to explain it:
"Our friends hate it when we become successful." Many loser-cum-winners then
become photogenic and find others struggling in the highest world of total
literature with euphoric isolation. Will they be the new winner? Is loser
obscurity the only free win to total sublimity? Reckless guile will crash
with the squeal of a termite's pitched scream.

sorry to pour salt on Ed's wounds, but what verb is that? --

"hence forth I will @$#*&!! to those sites."

what verb, expletive or otherwise, takes a preposition in that kind of
construction?=20

"I will _post_ to those sites."
"I will _write_ to those sites."
"I will _call out_ to those sites."
"I will _drive_ to those sites."
"I will _be obligated_ to those sites."
"I will _hit a pop fly out_ to those sites."
"I will _give my unvarnished opinion_ to those sites."

looks like transitive verbs, or verbs of motion -- doesn't work for
expletives, since you can't fuck to, shit to, or damn to anything or
-one...=20

you can say "'fuck off' to those sites," I guess... which is what Ed's
trying to do, if us gnats and poetry spammers would only let him...

here's indelible electronic ink in your eye...

Dearly Beloved,

We are so pleased to request your attendance at the following THREE events
(read below). Harken the beginning of this season=B9s Friday Late Night
Series. Rejoice!

Love,

The Poetry Project


Monday, October 9, 8:00 pm
Jon Paul Fiorentino & Paul Foster Johnson

Jon Paul Fiorentino's most recent book of poetry is The Theory of the Loser
Class (Coach House Books, 2006). He is the author of the poetry book Hello
Serotonin (Coach House Books, 2004) and the humour book Asthmatica
(Insomniac Press, 2005). His most recent editorial projects are the
anthologies Career Suicide! Contemporary Literary Humour (DC Books, 2003)
and Post-Prairie - a collaborative effort with Robert Kroetsch, (Talonbooks=
,
2005). He lives in Montreal where he teaches writing at Concordia Universit=
y
and is the Managing Editor of Matrix magazine. Paul Foster Johnson's first
collection of poems, Refrains/Unworkings, will be published in Spring 2007
by Apostrophe Books. Quadriga, a chapbook of his collaborations with E.
Tracy Grinnell, was recently released by g-o-n-g press. Currently serving a=
s
an editor at Litmus Press, he curated the Experiments and Disorders reading
series at Dixon Place from 2003 to 2006.


Wednesday, October 11, 8:00 pm
Michael Friedman & Chris Kraus

Michael Friedman has edited the journal Shiny since 1986. His first novel,
Martian Dawn, is just out from Turtle Point. Several poems from his last
book, Species (The Figures, 2000), were included in the anthology Great
American Prose Poems: From Poe to the Present (Scribner, 2003). Blowing
apart the boundary line between experimental narrative and staid
autobiography, Chris Kraus is the author of three novels, I Love Dick,
Aliens and Anorexia, and the recently released Torpor, which are as much
about the space (and time) we inhabit as they are about their narrator.
Operating on both sides of the production line, Kraus serves as the editor
of the Native Agents Series of the Semiotext(e) imprint, the home to kindre=
d
poets and novelists such as Eileen Myles, Heather Woodbury, and The
Bernadette Corporation. She is also a teacher of writing and has written
numerous essays on poetics, theory, and art.


Friday, October 13, 10:30 pm
Dirty Movies Late at Night: Mike Hauser, Maureen Thorson & The Trusty Knife

Rust Buckle and various simpaticos from disparate America celebrate the
release of a new chapbook by Mike Hauser. Mike Hauser lives in Milwaukee. H=
e
posts his poems to dodo:(hubbahubbain78.blogspot.com). He publishes the
magazine Dodo Bird on a very inconsistent basis. He still has copies of
that, and of the chapbook Dirty Movies Late at Night (Rust Buckle), he can
give you. Maureen Thorson is the author of two chapbooks, Novelty Act (Ugly
Duckling Presse) and the forthcoming Mayport (Poetry Society of America).
She lives in Washington, D.C., where she runs Big Game Books, the tiniest
press in the world. Zack Pieper & The Trusty Knife are a band of
basement/bathroom/garage/attic songsters from Milwaukee, WI who perform an
array of eclectic rock & roll material & will be presenting their low-tech
folk-rot album Sad Contraptions Unrehearsed. Dustin Williamson is the
co-curator of this event. He edits the Rust Buckle magazine and chapbook
series. He is the author of the chapbooks Heavy Panda (Goodbye Better),
Gorilla Dust (forthcoming from Open 24 Hour Press), and Power Lunch, a
collaboration with the poet Gina Myers. B.Y.O.D.M.

Too dull. She stirs out of a dream.
That sucks. She slips out of a clinic.

The transit is slow; the credit is wrecked.
The fear is real; the doctor is sick

Her transfer is gone; her money is low.
Her mind is made up; her pills do not work.

from Chapter One of Martian Dawn

Richard and Julia strolled along Rodeo Drive, monogrammed tote bags in each
hand. The sidewalk was crowded, but they hardly seemed to notice. It was a
bright, sunny day. Julia was momentarily struck by how beautiful the red
awnings of the Beverly Wilshire Hotel looked against the pale, sandblasted
facades of the hotel and boutiques.
They returned, exhausted from shopping, to their modernist glass compound
nestled in the Hollywood Hills. Sunlight streamed through glass-walled
living room from the Japanese garden. There, Julia felt, they were away fro=
m
it all - Morty, Mars, everything. It was just Richard and her. Her old life
with Angel and the gang seemed like a distant Jacqueline Susann nightmare.
She watched Richard move silently through the house, stopping to rearrange
the flowers and pictures. Sometimes, she reflected, he was like a wild
animal - a black panther padding through the brush of Equatorial Guinea at
dusk.

that would be "I will _be bitching_ to those sites" -- kinda weak, with
the passive use of the participle...

or "I will _bitch_ to those sites"
   "I will _bitch & moan_ to those sites"

that's what he's already doing



bitchin'

â€œBRAIN LINGOâ€ WORKSHOP and POETRY READING /
PERFORMANCE
BY EDWIN TORRES

WHEN: Monday, Oct. 9.
WORKSHOP 11:00 am - 12:30 pm.
READING/PERFORMANCE 5:00 - 6:30.

WHERE:
The CAS GALLERY of the UNIVERSITY OF MIAMI'S WESLEY
FOUNDATION
1210 STANFORD DR.
(Coral Gables Campus)

Both events are open to all.

Legendary NY-based poet and multimedia artist Edwin
Torresâ€™s always freshly experimenting work has
ranged from performances that helped spearhead the
spoken word movement in the 1990s to
post-multiculturalist visual poetry influenced by
Futurism and Bauhaus. His poetry books include THE
ALL-UNION DAY OF THE SHOCK WORKER (Roof Books),
FRACTURED HUMOROUS (Subpress), and the forthcoming THE
POPEDOLOGY OF AN AMBIENT LANGUAGE. His CDs include
HOLY KID (Kill Rock Stars) and NOVO (OozeBap.org).

Torresâ€™ many collaborations with other artists
intermingle poetry with textures of sound, theater,
and improvisation, and his Brain Lingo workshops have
led many students to new modes of writing. Torres has
taught at Bard College and Naropa University, among
others, and is co-editor of the journal RATTAPALLAX.
The recipient of numerous fellowships, he is the Lower
Manhattan Cultural Councilâ€™s 2006
writer-in-residence. Check out Torresâ€™ website at
<www.brainlingo.com>.

There will be a book signing after the evening
reading. For further information, please contact
Victor Garcia, MFA Events Coordinator
<Vicgarcia1983@yahoo.com> / cell: 305-244-8884 or
Walter K. Lew <wlew@miami.edu>.

Seismosis, by John Keene + Christopher Stackhouse
with a Foreword by Ed Roberson + an Afterword by Geoffrey Jacques
$19 / ISBN: 0977935108
Featuring line-drawings by Stackhouse & poems-as-essays by Keene--handed
back and forth and back again, written and rewritten, drawn and
redrawn--Seismosis penetrates the common ground between
writing/literature
and drawing/visual art, creating a revisioned landscape where much of
the
work is abstract, or abstracted, or both.

The multiform agreements the texts & the drawings make, from a brilliant
&
decisive center, are revolutionary, antilinear, and highly responsive.
The
result is a sophisticated call-and-response affair. A pioneering event
between two African-American artists, Seismosis is a formal experience.


John Keene is a former member of the Dark Room Writers Collective, a
graduate fellow of Cave Canem, and recipient of many awards and
fellowships-including a 2003 Poetry Fellowship from the New Jersey State
Council on the Arts and a 2005 Mrs. Giles Whiting Foundation Prize for
fiction. Keene is the author of the acclaimed experimental novel,
Annotations, from New Directions.

Christopher Stackhouse is the author of Slip (Corollary Press), a Cave
Canem graduate fellow, a poetry editor at Fence magazine, and a New York
Foundation for the Arts Fellow in Poetry for 2005. An MFA candidate at
Bard College, Stackhouse is also an exhibiting artist whose canvases and
works on paper have appeared in several New York City galleries.

Advance Praises for Seismosis :

It's what happens when writing and drawing give each other a hand, a
free
hand, to shake it up, to go the distance from crossing out to crossing
over, from ear to here and back again, fast. A little nerve music for
the
time being-sampling seismo for the pleisto scene.
-- David Levi Strauss

... Seismosis is the complete text for the course, replete with
illustrations, examples, graphs, exercises, and tests.
-- from the Foreword by Ed Roberson

This exquisite collaboration goes beyond a linear mutual appreciation:
poet likes artist's work-artist likes poet's work. In Seismosis, Keene &
Stackhouse present an interwoven, intersecting conversation between one
another and their art forms. We read the poems and see the drawings-we
read the drawings and see the poems, as the collaborators make use of
space, line, and textural performance in one multimedia framework. Here,
two men's boyish charms and haunting playfulness create a
three-dimensional canvas out of thinking inscriptions.
-- Tracie Morris

Wow. Rarely a book makes such an impact. Keene and Stackhouse heat up
the
strange place where abstraction becomes as visceral as thoughts or
conversations. Anyone interested in artistic collaborations will rarely
find one this complete, in the pleasure of ever-forming and dissolving
boundaries between gestures. An immediate delight.
-- Thalia Field

 >>what verb is that? -- "@$#*&!! to those sites."


The verb is @$#*&!! just as written. @$#*&!! is
untranslatable. It cannot be rendered phonetically,
intensified, abbreviated, or set in all caps. @$#*&!!
doesn't rhyme with $#@&*'! or with any other word. It does
not scan. It has no synonyms. Etymologists trace its origins
to cartoons of the twentieth century, but they may be
@$#*&!! themselves and are consequently not to be trusted.
@$#*&!! becomes fierce when discussed; it coalesces into a
referential black hole that sucks the meaning from any given
semantic space. If cornered by a definition, @$#*&!! will
void all poems and stop all E-mails. Even Martin Heidegger,
way out there on the horizon of verhandenheit, knew better
than to mess with @$#*&!!

The only person you can rely on is yourself...do you agree? That was the
moto that Marcus Garvey taught.
His mantra of hard work and self-reliance inspired a new generation of
black entrepreneurs to raise the profile of black people everywhere.

1Xtra's Robbo Ranx looks at how he inspired Malcolm X, the Nation of
Islam and the Rastafarian faith.

Nas name-checked Marcus Garvey in his Illmatic album while Akala lives
by his words.

No, those are threats, clearly threats.  I believe Ed is a terrorist, a poetry terrorist and as you know, you're either for us or you're against us.  Ed needs to be rounded up, strapped to a board with his feet slightly higher than his head, and then must endure someone reading inspirational poetry to him. He'll crack.  Fast.  I guarantee it.

Hello All--

I have started to post translations in progress to my blog, It's All
Connected, (http://itsallconnected.wordpress.com). The first one is up; it's
the Poet's Preface to the Shahnameh, which is the Persian national epic. If
you have a chance, give it a read and let me know what you think.

Thanks,

CALL FOR SUBMISSIONS

Deadlines: 1 December 2006 for proposals; 1 April 2007 for finished essays
Journal: Open Letter, A Canadian Journal of Writing and Theory
Guest Editor: Lori Emerson

"What often happens on the death of an author is that an institutional
group of textual custodians comes into being=97scholars and editors who
present themselves as caring as passionately about that author's text
as the author once did...Much of this kind of activity...is
celebratory rather than productive or critical, even, or perhaps
especially, when it purports to offer no more than readings or
explications...Most of those interested in continuing to author Nichol
texts have been other writers.  Most of these have been writers of his
own generation, and most have been his friends.  There has been little
sign yet of scholars who hope to focus their careers on Barrie's
work."
=97Frank Davey

Open Letter is seeking essays for a special issue dedicated to "bp
Nichol + 20".  As a follow-up to the 1998 issue of Open Letter
"bpNichol + 10," we hope to reenliven and, especially, broaden the
critical landscape of Nichol's works.  The editors are particularly
interested in critical/critical-creative submissions from young and
emerging scholars/writers who are part of a generation that never knew
"Barrie" or "beep."

Submissions could address:
*Nichol's essays, sound poems, visual poems, novels, pamphlets,
broadsides, computer-poems, script writing, collaborations, ephemera
etc. and, of course, The Martyrology
*his work with Therafields, the TRG, the Four Horsemen, the Tish poets etc.
*his literary inheritors
*his literary and/or philosophical influences
*the issue of autobiography in relation to his work
*his critical reception outside of Canada and/or the U.S.

However, the above list is merely suggestive.

SUBMISSION GUIDELINES
Please send proposals to Lori Emerson (lori.emerson@gmail.com) by 1
December 2006.  Notifications of acceptance will be made no later than
15 January 2007.  Finished essays will be appreciated by 1 April 2005
and should not exceed 3500 words in length.

WALKING POEM: call for submissions
****************************************

"the big steel sculpture
that looks at once
like a bird and a woman"
- Chicago Sun-Times, 8/15/67

I am collecting writing about walking in cities.  This
writing may take any shape or form -- poem, story,
essay, letter, etc.  All writing will be used to
create a Walking Poem for "Chicago Calling: a 24-Hour
Arts Festival" (http://www.chicagocalling.org).
Starting from the Chicago Picasso statue, I will walk
and navigate the city using the collected writing as
my map.  Once read outloud, each piece will be given
away to passing pedestrians.  A gesture similar to
Pablo Picasso's, who gave his sculpture as a "gift to
the people of Chicago" and refused a fee for this
work.

SUBMISSION DEADLINE:
*October 23, 2006

SUBMIT:
*All writing will considered for 2007-08 publication.
*Send published or unpublished writing.
*Choose and send one direction:
forward, backwards, right or left.
*Choose and send one number:
1 - 92 (Picasso's age at death).

CONTACT:
*Email submissions as word attachment
with subject: WALKING POEM
to jkarmin@yahoo.com
*Snail mail submissions
to Jennifer Karmin
2652 W.Evergreen, 2R
Chicago, IL 60622

"CHICAGO CALLING: a 24-Hour Arts Festival"
********************************************
Chicago-based artists will showcase performances and
projects that involve collaborations with artists
living in other locations — here in the U.S. and in
other countries worldwide.  Artists involved with
"Chicago Calling" work in a range of media, including:
music, painting, photography, poetry, and dance.
Their collaborations will be prepared, improvised, or
a combination of both.  Some will involve live feeds
between Chicago and elsewhere.  The first "Chicago
Calling" event will begin at 12 a.m. on Wednesday,
October 25th and the final event will end at midnight
on that day. October 25th was chosen as the date of
"Chicago Calling" because it is Pablo Picasso’s
birthday.

Does anyone ever get the feeling that we're, in fact,
killing poetry and that most of us just don't have
anything really very interesting to say - because many
of us are, well, just not very interesting and then,
of course, elitest to boot, as they say? Just a
question.

Poetry will die with the last person, but the rest is probably true.
Maybe poetry should start from the premise "We have nothing to say."

the soul is a happiness considered

but the bread of philosophy molds
with the fading of intentions

there is so little to say the one tongue
mistranslates the five senses

Walk Don't Destroy 2 is an opportunity to raise money and awareness for the Develop Don't Destroy Legal Fund -- won't you please help me?

Dear Poetics List,

On October 21st, I'm walking with Develop Don't Destroy Brooklyn to end eminent domain abuse, massive over-development and the destruction of the Brooklyn we know and love. Help me stop Forest City Ratner’s land grab and ensure a better future for our neighborhoods by raising money for the Develop Don't Destroy Legal Fund.



DDDb's legal team is preparing for major litigation over eminent domain, environmental degradation and the misappropriation of publicly owned property. Some of the legal cases are already underway, thanks to the donations we received last year.  There are just over two weeks left before my walk -- won't you please contribute to the effort by sponsoring me to raise money and awareness?

Login to visit my personal web page and help me in my efforts to support Develop Don't Destroy Brooklyn

 >>Does anyone ever get the feeling that we're, in fact,

If you want real bores and louts, check the lives of famous
poets. It's almost as though poetry has nothing to do with
the lives of its creators.

Take this excerpt from _Dream Song, The Life of John
Berryman_, by Paul Mariani. It describes the way Roethke
behaved at a party thrown by Edmund Wilson.

_____

Soon Wilson was asking Berryman what he thought of Roethke's
poetry.  He had yet to meet the man, Berryman told him, but
he had only praise for his poems.  On the strength of that
recommendation, Wilson invited Roethke to a party Christmas
night.

. . . . at nine o'clock that evening, Roethke's large
'aggressively sober' frame appeared in the doorway with
several of his friends.  When Wilson introduced Roethke to
Berryman, Roethke acted as if he'd never heard the name.

Roethke began by swilling tomato juice and flirting with the
female guests. But when he saw Wilson sitting on the couch,
he plopped down next to him, demanding that Wilson 'blow'
the party and come upstairs so he could show him his poems.
  Wilson explained that as host he couldn't very well be
expected to abandon his guests.  Then Roethke was grabbing
at Wilson's jowls and telling one of America's most powerful
critics he was 'all blubber.'

Wilson countered by calling Roethke a half-baked Bacchus and
ordering him to leave.  As he stormed toward the door,
Roethke ran into Allen Tate's daughter, Nancy, and her
husband, Dr. Wood.  Mrs. Wilson, trying to make some
introductions, awkward at best since Roethke was being
thrown out, explained that Dr. Wood was a psychiatrist.
Then, when Wood reached out to shake Roethke's hand,
Roethke, thinking he was about to be restrained, lashed out
and hit him. Roethke's friends hastily tried to explain that
it was all a misunderstanding, that Roethke had never hit
anyone before, even as they rushed him out the door and the
tired year slammed shut behind them.

poetry, as ive seen it, is a reaction between language (as a cultural
entity) and the poet's experience. as young writers we learn about
language and others' experiences with it ('literature'). tempered by
what reactions with the outside world our current selves/experiences
allow. the angle of the relationship between personal experience and
linguistic depth/knowledge may be factored in as vision or talent (which
usually can't be explained).
we work with language because of some craving/need, that language may or
may not be a path toward solving

Philip Whalen=B9s 1969 =B3Kyoto=B2 notebook (in part of which he announces that
=B3Rip Torn Is Alive and Well in Kansas.=B2) The chapter also offers an =B3At
Work=B2 essay by Kevin Killian on the value of the recent, substantial
acquisition of a new Jack Spicer archive (via Robin Blazer), including
illustrations of a notebook page from the poet=B9s Beowulf translation, as
well as an intriguing, handsome collage of a poster he constructed to
advertise the 1958 publication of Billy The Kid.

Dan wrote: poetry, as ive seen it, is a reaction between
language (as a cultural entity) and the poet's experience.
as young writers we learn about language and others'
experiences with it ('literature')

I know this is fashionable theory, but language (as a
cultural entity) only exists in particular people at
particular times. There is no disembodied Platonic Idea
"language" out there ... except in abstract theory.

True, we acquire a sense of the narratives of others as we
read more throughout our lives. Yet we're not having an
encounter with an abstraction called "language." We're
learning the story of being human -- by particular
narratives encountered at particular times. Hence the most
significant feature of poetry and prose--a reader's
identification with the narrative or the lyricism--cannot be
accounted for by summoning an abstraction called "language."

Compounding matters, my reaction to your definition is
itself a form of abstraction, even as it tries to point away
from abstractions. Put another way, our ability to ride a
horse is NOT the result of an encounter with something
called "horse-ness"; rather it comes from riding particular
horses at particular times.

Wondering if I'm seeking an abstract argument about concrete
things or merely advancing a concrete argument about
abstractions,
Eric

born in Za=EFre (now Democratic Republic of Congo). Made famous by the =20=

successes of the Rocado Zulu Th=E9=E0tre, a theatre company he formed in =

language. His plays include Conscience de tracteur (1979), La =20
Parenth=E8se de sang (1981; Parentheses of Blood, 1986), Je soussign=E9 =20=

going to the heart of the Congolese ambience, many of his plays were =20
popular in Africa as well as Europe, where he often toured. He is =20

L'=C9tat honteux (1981), L'Ant=E9peuple (1983; The Antipeople, 1988), =
Les =20

Sandra Miller at 8PM on Saturday, October 14th, at 8:00PM at Pyramid

Ben Doyle's first collection of poems, Radio, Radio, won the 2000 Walt
Whitman award. His poems can be found in current or forthcoming issues
of Boston
Review, Tin House, Denver Quarterly, and 1913. His new manuscript, Dead
Ahead, has been called "clusterfucked" by a reputable national press. He
lives with his wife, the poet Sandra Miller, and their canine in Roanoke,
where he teaches Creative Expression to tough kids.

Sandra Miller's first book, Oriflamme, was published by Ahsahta Press in
2005. Selections from her new work=97Chora=97keep popping up in Aufgabe, Ve=
rse,
Crowd, and Denver Quarterly. Miller teaches on one of those one-year things
at Hollins University, where she lives on Maggie's Farm with her husband,
the poet Ben Doyle, and their dog, the dog Ronald Johnson.

We hope you can join us for the reading and the festivities afterwards.

Hi all,

Boog City issue 37 is going to press later this week. We need someone with a
car/van/pick-up who wants to make some extra $$ by distributing this issue
to 44 drop spots, 36 in lower Manhattan (26 in the East Village) and eight
in Williamsburg. The goal is for the paper to be distributed this Saturday,
but there is some flexibility with that day.

Email editor@boogcity.com or call (212) 842-BOOG (2664) for further details,
including payment information.

thanks!

> He created new species from these breeding pairs -- not hybrids, but

>
> Jim was intensely curious, but not restless. He asked, "What's next?"

> motion. He remained in perpetual morphogenesis (to borrow a term =20

> meaning "evolving and changing in shape," from one of his favorite

>
> 8.
> The homes that Jim and Lauren Pratt made over the past 20 years --

> always
> full. They were places where art and ideas were welcome, there was no
> need for pretense, and there was all the time in the world. Careerism,
> gossip, gig-talk, pettiness and the like seemed inappropriate. His =20
> home
> was a haven for art -- a safe and necessary respite from the =20
> quotidian.
> Anyone and everyone was welcomed: his and Lauren's idea of the "open

>
> He listened with a singular intensity, imbued personal relationships

>
> 9.
> Like Cage, Partch, Var=E8se, Hiller, Harrison, Ruggles, and some of =
the

> thought, "embodiments of mind" (a phrase from another of his favorite
> authors, Warren McCullough, whose work he was revisiting the last =20

> spoke to him). His writings provide the foundation for a remarkable

>
> For me, though, much of the joy in remembering Jim emanates from =20

> like wildflowers. These musical and theoretical "volunteers" delighted

> this, his tremendous glee in solving some "smaller" compositional or
> theoretical dilemma was evident. He'd get a particular kind of grin on
> his face, like he'd just solved a riddle rather than proved a theorem.
>
> All of this is in the music, sometimes deeply embedded, sometimes
> immediately apparent. I remember the moment the compositional idea of

> Ruggles -- and who knows what else!? Understanding Jim's techniques
> reduced you to a kind of dumb, teenage-inflected "how cool is that?"
> grin, wishing you'd thought of it yourself.
>
> He seldom published or formally described these intermediate
> compositional ideas. Nor were they premeditated: he created them as he

>
> These ideas give a sense of Jim's playfulness and deep commitment to
> compositional craft, something I think that is often overlooked =20

> "next lower dimension."
>
> But I think this is a deeper metaphor for Jim's work. I often feel =20

>
> When I learned the chronology of his final days from Lauren, I =20

-- i am wondering if there are theological statements that might NOT just as
easily be applied to poetry  -- for example the following quote from Ricoeur
seems just as aptly written of poetry as faith -- more concisely put, i
think this is a matter of whether it is possible to say something of the
uncaused cause, that it is not also possible to say of a poem -- with the
exception of the fact, maybe that there can be/is an uncaused cause, but
there cannot be an uncaused poem -- yet there is no point in saying where a
poem comes from, would be my backwoods approach to the question -- since i
didn't study symbolic logic, i wonder what others might say?

from Ricoeur
"Yet, it is in terms of one certain presupposition that I stand in the
position of a listener to Christian preaching.  I assume that this speaking
is meaningful, that it is worthy of consideration, and that examining it may
accompany and guide the transfer from the text to life where it will verify
itself fully.
Can I account for this presupposition?  Alas, I stumble already.  I do not
know how to sort out what is here 'unravelable' situation, uncriticized
custom, deliberate preference, or profound choice.  I can only confess that
my desire to hear more is all these things, and that it defies all these
distinctions." [quoted by Mark I. Wallace]

Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; format=flowed

These live LEA NMP chats are a lot of fun...faster and in some ways more
intimate than a listserv, more stimulating than a conference or panel. I
thought that tonight's with Loss Glazier went very well. Plenty of folks are
participating already -- you are also invited to come join us !

Best, Tim

*  *  *

Leonardo Electronic Almanac Discussion (LEAD): New Media Poetry and Poetics

Moderated by Sandy Baldwin

This issue, we introduce the "Leonardo Electronic Almanac Discussion" (LEAD)
accompanying our "New Media Poetics and Poetry" special issue and gallery
edited by Tim Peterson. LEAD will have two components, a moderated
discussion list for readers to engage with the special issue authors (see
below for sign up information).

If you miss the chats and forum, fret not, an abridged version of the
discussions will be made available with the next issue of LEA.

Chat Schedule:

:: John Cayley - 9 Oct 2006 1400hrs EST

:: Loss Glazier 10/10 1900hrs EST

:: Stephanie Strickland 10/20 1pm EST

:: MEZ – 17 Oct 2006 @ 0300hrs EST

:: Jason Nelson – 24 Oct 2006 @ 1300hrs EST

How to participate in the live chat?
Live chats will use Jabber (http://www.jabber.org/), an open, secure,
ad-free alternative to consumer IM services like AIM, ICQ, MSN, and Yahoo.
The New Media Poetics chatroom is on the jabber.org public server under the
name "leanmp" and the password "leoalmanac." Follow three easy steps and you
are ready to join the chat:

1) Download and install a Jabber client. A list of recommended Jabber
clients is available at the following url:
http://www.jabber.org/software/clients.shtml. For Windows users, we
recommend the Exodus client. For Macintosh users, please use Psi, as the
other recommended clients do not consistently register on the Jabber server.
For Linux, Psi is also available, but the other recommended clients should
work as well.

2) Register as a user on the jabber.org public server. When you first open
your Jabber client you will see a start screen. If you do not see this
screen, or if you are not starting the client for the first time, the screen
is also available in a pull down menu as Account Details or Preferences
(depending on your Jabber client). Enter a username, password, and server.
Use any username and password you choose. Enter “jabber.org” as the server.
When you register, if your proposed username is taken, you need to choose
another. Check the button for "new account" or to automatically register the
account (depending on your client). Note: you may not be able to register if
you are not using one of the recommended clients listed above. Hit OK or
Login. Your Jabber client will then automatically register you and connect

California State University San Marcos invites
applications for a tenure track position of Assistant
Professor of Creative Writing, starting fall 2007.  We
are seeking a creative writer to teach undergraduate
and graduate workshops in multiple genres, as well as
literature and/or film courses. The successful
candidate will help us achieve the multi-cultural
values described in our departmental mission
statement. Significant publication in a primary genre
(area open) is essential; publication in a secondary
genre is helpful. Given our plans for a film and
literature concentration and our commitment to
innovative technology, an interest in screenwriting,
film studies, digital literature, and/or literature in
performance would be a plus.  We seek candidates
committed to teaching excellence in general education
and at all levels of the curriculum, including
introductory, general education, graduate courses, and
master's thesis supervision.  Successful candidates
will help us teach towards the values articulated in
our departmental mission statement available at
www.csusm.edu/ltwr.  Interviews will be held at the
2006 MLA convention. Please send letter of application
and vita to Dr. Kenneth Mendoza, LTWR Search
Committee, CSU, San Marcos, CA  92096-0001 by November
1, 2006, for best consideration.  Letters of
recommendation and writing samples by request.  CSUSM
is an Equal Opportunity/Title IX Employer.  The
University has a strong commitment to diversity and,
in that spirit, seeks a broad spectrum of candidates
including women, members of minority groups, and
people with disabilities. The position is contingent
upon funding.

poeticizers,

i'm looking to generate a list of blogs (links to) that aren't what
blogs typically/conventionally are (diaries, daybooks, journals,
self-publishing venues, news channels, zines or zine gateways, running
collections of essay, commentary, review)

blogs, then, that use the blog format/structure to unusual or
unexpected ends

that "log" differently or things not typically logged

anti-blogs, avant-blogs, post-blogs, etc.

if anything comes to mind -- or if that list or one like it is already
out there -- please front- for back-channel at your discretion.

[please back to bmarsh@factoryschool.org]

thanks,
bill

They think the four-seater plane that just hit the Manhattan highrise is owned by Cory Lidle.  No confirmation that he was on it.


  "He is Cory Lidle, who has been a major league pitcher for nine years and a pilot for seven months. He earned his pilot’s license last off-season and bought a four-seat airplane for $187,000. It is a Cirrus SR20, built in 2002, with fewer than 400 hours in the air.

  A player-pilot is still a sensitive topic for the Yankees, whose captain, Thurman Munson, was killed in the crash of a plane he was flying in 1979. Lidle, acquired from the Philadelphia Phillies on July 30, said his plane was safe."

Yeah, it's been confirmed that he was on the plane. First time I ever turned
to ESPN to get my news.

Thanks for the encouraging word, Stephen. It's an effort of attention
mostly, and at a surprisingly practical level. Listening differently--
and more often. Wondering if x might go with (or interestingly
against) y. I'm trying it for a while at least, wishing I had more
time to write out my impressions.

Angela: I thought I'd do "Mood Indigo," which I'd never heard before
finding it on PennSound earlier this week. Seeing as how you're a big
Schuyler fan, you probably already know it--and the great Nina Simone
cover of the Ellington tune I was thinking to follow or lead with.
Maybe I'll work in "The Bluet"  too (if I can figure out how to get
the mostly ignored studio cassette deck to actually trickle onto the
air--last week I couldn't figure out how to).

JP: The show streams in real time (when all the stars are properly
aligned: sometimes the server crashes for weeks on end), but there's
no mechanism in place for archiving it. Backchannel me if a
particular track especially interests you.

All best, to all,

Steve

including mine own, The Countdown...

and audio at the Subterranean Poets site
<http://subterraneanpoets.blogspot.com/> which plays the International Open
Mic at The Bookworm in Beijing...

suggestions...

Subject:      to synthesize the plot of Hesse's Steppenwolf
MIME-version: 1.0
Content-type: text/plain; charset=ISO-8859-1
Content-transfer-encoding: 7BIT

I have written a (poor, unpublished) novel a few years ago. My favorite
novel is Hesse's Steppenwolf, and researching to write a second novel
that would surely be better than my first, I want to attempt a synthesis
of the plot of Steppenwolf into which structure I might translate my own
experience. I am looking for interesting vantage points that others may
offer, preferably without much thought, into certain moments in the text
that, for instance, one would love to read in the context of
comtemporary America, whose "bourgeois life" would be the projection of
a working class individual.

Briefly, what three instances are most pivotal in Steppenwolf? And if
you had to take two books into permanent seclusion, one requisite being
Steppenwolf, what would be its companion text?

 >>what three instances are most pivotal in Steppenwolf?

1. When Haller is given the Treatise on the Steppenwolf.

2. When Haller meets Hermine.

3. When Mozart gives Haller a good talking to, and gets him
to lighten up.

Why is this news "only for Yankees fans:?--
Cory Lidle played nine seasons in the Majors--of which only the last ten
weeks were for the Yankees--
Baseball--and sports fans --from anywhere and everywhere mourned Lidle's
death--his number was repeatedly honored and shown during the Tigers-A's

people were all tipping their hat to Lidle--
If he hadn't been a Yankee for ten weeks do you think you'd be paying

Have some respect for baseball and sports fans of the world who know about

Good grief!   I wasn't limiting the message to  per seYankees' fans; instead I was noting that I realize this is a list for POETICS and that I was toeing the line by posting unrelated news here.  In fact, I haven't watched the Yankees play in quite sometime, nor have I seen him play (not even the other night), so I probably don't even count as an official fan based on your rant.

  If you want to debate the history of who played for what time when and how long it takes to call a team "home" and what consitutes a "fan" etc etc, then I'm sure there's a baseball listserv somewhere.

  I apologize to the list for posting non-related poetry info, esp since it seems David is willfully misreading the subject line of my post and attempting to create strife and dissension through his incredibly rude diatribe where certainly none was intended, a fact that is fairly obvious.

  But hasn't this kind of angry, presumptuous response become typical on this list over the past few years?  It's one of the main reasons why discussions are no longer productively sustained, but instead fizzle out in an angry flurry of performance and pride.

first thing I thought of was: suicide? was Lidle despondent over the =
Yankees' failure in the playoffs (stupid and simplistic reaction, but =
can we prove it's wrong?)... so then where's the suicide note? and maybe =
there are no answers, even with a note or other indication of "why". and =
death mocks any striving for answers, anyway.=20

so:

no desired answers.
only forgetting=20
the desire for answers.
in the air over East River=20
there are no questions.


amen to Amy's statement: more poetics, less vitriol (but vitriolic =
poetics? am willing to split the diff).

(NB: no MN Twins have done themselves in following their defeat in =
Oakland last week... not yet, anyway)

a related note & a plug: u of illinois in 2004 published an anthology I
edited, Poetry from Sojourner: A Feminist Anthology. I was a poetry ed at
Sojourner, the feminist mag, for many yrs, & this collection is abt 1/10 of
the poetry that appeared in the life of the mag. My happiest addition to th=
e
mag's pages & later the book were poets I solicited work from, like Lyn
Hejinian, Leslie Scalapino, Kathleen Fraser, Rosmarie Waldrop & other
innovative poets bec their work is feminist in its breaking the syntax. You
can get the anthology from U of Illinois.

Without much thought, a supreme bourgeois moment in
Steppenwolf that has stuck with me lo these many years
is the landlady polishing the leaves of a houseplant.

breaking the syntax

seems to me to be another of those veiled or vague statements we are all
guilty of using.

like calling poetry "organic".

as poets, or at least 'appreciators" of poetry, shouldn't we be more precis=

mark and others, sure, lots of people have done it for even longer
than 60 years even in english....

that said, one "breaks syntax" (i'm assuming we all know what we mean
by that...) in different ways and for different reasons. althusser's
"coupure" comes to mind...coupled with a line i'm tired of quoting,
from hal foster in 1980 i think, about there being two types of
postmodernism, one of resistance and one of reaction.

of course, yes yes, oversimplified (esp. 20+ years later), but still
a useful model in these discussions. it's quite possible to argue, i
suppose, that the phrase "feminist in breaking the syntax" might be
relevant only at the generative stage of writing, not at the level of
reception---that is, one might sit down and intend to "break" to
achieve a feminist end (process), while a reader might not see any
feminism therein (product---another tired binary). we might see a
resistor and a reactor utilizing very similar gestures, but whether a
specific textual materiality accrues is hard for me to say---i
haven't made a study of it.

nonetheless, i feel that i grasp the *spirit* of ruth lepson's
comment, and appreciate it.

I don't know who said it, but I do find myself agreeing with it.=20

however, is this equating grammar / syntax / normative language (as it
were) with the King / Patriarchy / Nobodaddy that instigates our
disenfranchisement?=20

just because you break syntax doesn't mean you're sticking it to the
Man, I think.=20

I still don't get how breaking syntax becomes a specifically Feminist
activity...

I think that one thinks of this kind of breaking of syntax in
relation to Lacanian theory and the idea that one becomes a citizen,
member of society and its orders, by speaking the Name of the
Father-- this is both literal language and its inherent dominance and
suppressions (a binary system) and the symbolic languages of how we
order our worlds.
Thus, writers who mess with such established orders are often those
who experiment with the writing of feminist text (perhaps Cixous,
certainly Theresa Cha or Monique WIttig, among others)

but that requires everyone buying in to Lacanian theory, Name of the Father
etc.

Ms. King,

I take exception to your appropriation of the time-honored and beloved
"catch-phrase," if you will, perpetually uttered by Charlie Brown,
creation of equally beloved cartoonist Charles M. Schulz, to further
your point of the futility of trying to equate poetry with sports.
Surely no parallel can be drawn between the mindset of those who
practice and discuss the art of poetry with those who beller in the
bleachers. As another infamous Charlie has said, "it's inapppropriate
to appropriate." When Poetics list members start behaving like boorish
sports "fans" that give their sport of choice a bad name, 'twill be a
dark and stormy night indeed.

Waiting for the Great Pumpkin,

Dan

NONE? so there isn't a single person who can practice and discuss the art of
poetry with those who beller in the bleachers?

In the case of what I wrote, certainly. Just as so many writers and
speakers every day can "buy" in to the idea that language is
transparent-- again, an idea many (but not all)  hold on how the
system of language "works".

Though I must admit I only today began reading these posts, so I
don't know what was discusses earlier in this thread.

 >>"the poet who is not in trouble with the king is in

Counter-example is Pushkin, who was associated with the
Decembrist Revolutionaries. The king (Tsar)took it upon
himself to edit/censor Pushkin's work, and keep him under
house arrest until the Decembrists were quelled.

Pushkin was in trouble with the government, but not with the
king, who kept him safe so that his genius wouldn't be
wasted in revolutionary politics, imprisonment, or execution.

Nicholas I was not that benevolent, Eric. Due to the Czar's censorship and bedroom jealousies, Pushkin could not travel and spent his last days before his final and mortal duel writing more histories than poetry.

Note also early feminist Mahadevi-Akka's prolific Kannada vachunas to Siva after she had rejected king and wisemen of her 10th century Dravidian realm. Inspiration thrives in challenging the status quo, breaking syntax if you will.

jack spicer, stephen dunn, robert coover (i know he's not a poet) are all
great writers who are also great fans of sport (esp. baseball) and even make
baseball the subject of their work.

let's not pretend that those who enjoy sports are "bellering" idiots or
swine.  one reason the arts tend to be so marginalized is the perception
that artists/poets/etc. are elitist snob, looking down our noses at the
masses amused by their silly games while we sip cabernet and discuss plato.

Subject:      an apology--"what we have here is a failure to communicate"
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; format=flowed

Dear Amy:

I apologize--
i think we have a failure to communicate.
I hope i can perhaps explain a little and bring a peaceful understanding--

What I was writing about wasn't to create strife and dissension, angry
presumptious diatribe etc --what I was expressing was that the header
expresses a form of elitism and possesion, that Cory Lidle belongs only to
New York, and that only New York mourns this tragedy.  I was saying that on
the contrary, baseball and sports fans everywhere mourn this event and know
of Lidle's career not simply as a Yankee but also as a member of the six
other teams he played for over nine years.  It doesn't really have to do
with the amount of baseball information, but with the attitude of elitism
and sole possesion expressed in "Only for Yankees Fans".

(Also people are being very generous to Lidle --just a few days ago he
wasn't very popular with his teammates or many in NYC and the media as he
had come out with criticisms of the Yankees not being prepared for their
division series agsinst the Tigers and in 1995 he was a replacement player
during the baseball players' strike--a scab in other words, making him not
always the most popular guy in the clubhouse of the many teams he played
for.
        None of this matters here of course, except that people on the list
have quoted stories and mentioned news about him and speculated a bit about
him, so these are a few more facts to contribute to the discussion of who he
was.)
(The question of suicide was raised--i seriously doubt re Lidle but this did
really happen with a pitcher who was involved on a losing team in a divison
series--the Angels who lost to the come-from behind Red Sox in 1986--i can't
recall his name at the moment, very good relief pitcher, gave up dramatic
home run to Dave Henderson and blamed himself for the Angels' loss--later
committed suicide--never recovered from the event--)(George Bowering will
know who i mean--)

  Personally I have tried in all my time on this list not to be a
contributer to the sort of discourse you critique.  I apologize that my
emotions as a sports fan aren't as cool as they are in other regards
but I did find the exclusiveness and elitism of the header offensive.  I'm
sorry that my reply was too hasty and overboard, I really should have
phrased it far better, to say the least.

    I think your response shows the miscommunication i mention above.  "I
wasn't limiiting the message to per se Yankees fans"--then why write "for
Yankees fans only"?
   I am not "willfully misreading" your message at all--I am reading what
you wrote.  I can't read what your intentions were, I can only read the
words that appear on the screen.
     (During David Frost's interviews with Nixon, he played some of Nixon's
own tapes of his conversations with his aides to Nixon, Nixon giving orders
to do such and such--to which Nixon responded--"that is what I said, but
that is not what I meant."  Frost said--"Yes, but how can the listener know
what you meant if you are not saying it?")

      Baseball and poetry aren't seperate subjects--there was just the
announcement of the annual Boog City Baseball Poetry issue  (I'm honored to
have been chosen for inclusion in this in the past) and Marianne Moore for
example was known for her baseball poems and devotion to her beloved
Brooklyn Dodgers.  There are a great number of anthologies of baseball
writings by poets and writers.
Think Jack Spicer for starters alone . . . the list is very long--
(And Virginia Woolf was a huge fan of Ring Lardner's great epistolary
baseball novel You Know Me, Al--)
Many poets on his list have written beautifully on baseball and can discuss
it for hours on end with one, and know more than I do.
       I am sorry I phrased my response so poorly because I was thinking of
how many baseball fans there are on this list whom I know of, and that a
header such as "for Yankees fans only" in such a context is shall we say
tactless and exclusive.
        I also deplore the "angry presumptuous responses" you do and
apologize for giving such an impression.
     The elitism here and often displayed on the list does concern me.  You
introduced a topic, baseball, but for Yankess fans only.  When I protest
that other fans count also, you say you didn't mean Yankees fans only per
se, (yet what you wrote is  not apparently what you meant) and that "I'm
sure there's a baseball listserv somewhere" where any further discussion can
go. There's a hint of condescension--it's okay for you to bring the subject
up--but for anyone to discuss it--take it outside the nice place.
       You also assert that it is "a fact that is fairly obvious" no strife
and dissension is "intended" that this event being reported  is "for Yankees
fans only".  (Though one would imagine if you follow baseball even a bit,
you would know how much that would rile people up--not just outside
NYC--what abt Mets fans!)
         Again it is the gulf between the intention and what is there in
writing that is the miscommunication.  I apologize but I can't read the
intention on an email screen--what comes across is that a public event in
which there is a great outpouring of sympathy and grief concerning a
participant in the "National Pastime"  is being roped off and made the
possesion of the elite few.  It's like Orwell's Animal Farm, in which all
animals are equal, but some are more equal than others.
For some strange reason, that bothers me.
      I hope this makes thing clearer?
  What I am trying to say is now that I understand what your intentions are
behind the words, and that I have hopefully explained what I read as the
words are printed--and one can see what the miscommunications are--
may we shake hands and say peace--or the sign of peace which you use?
bring at least one misunderstanding on this list to understanding?
all my best,
david-bc

The problem with "breaking the syntax" is the same as the one with
"breaking the pentameter" -- what do you propose to use instead? Are
women going to invent a whole new language other than English to use
in order to create a whole new literature? Will this language be
accessible to men, or will it be as obdurately feminine as those who
advocate breaking the syntax claim that the existing language is
masculine?

The "breaking the pentameter" folly ought to be a warning. The
Ford/Lowell/Pound group who fought to break the pentameter hoped and
dreamed that some new meter would emerge -- and it didn't. Instead we
have prose lineated as poetry, as the majority of generation after
generation of poets was taught to abandon meter and metaphor
altogether in favor of trying to write philosophy, social commentary,
private diaries, and essays with a ragged right edge. Where is poetry
now because of it? Disparaged and marginalized -- no longer a force
for anything in its own culture, except among an increasingly
alienated elite who find it difficult to say just what it is they're
doing, and why, to ordinary people.

Why should your plumber or carpenter or car salesman care about
"breaking the pentameter" or "breaking the syntax"? These are arcane
issues the politics of which are so vicious because the stakes are so
small, as Hutchins famously said of academic politics. Do any of you
care about the debate about argon-filled as opposed to dessicated-air-
filled insulated unit windows? About the debate about curatorial
techniques for sustaining or restoring pieces of art? About whether
black irises are really black or just dark red? About any of any
number of other strongly-fought debates among the elites of any
number of other small coteries of experts? I mean, except for as an
article to read in the New Yorker that you don't even read all of
because after a while you realize that it's all just the same sort of
politics that you're reading the New Yorker to avoid thinking about
in your own department?

Do you really think "breaking the syntax" is going to change the
world if there's no other syntax invented or available to replace it?
What, exactly, is the point of this metaphor, "breaking the syntax"?
What does it mean when it's at home? What are the consequences of
"breaking the syntax" if you succeed? Are you really advocating
inarticulate physical violence as a means of communication between
humans because the syntax has bee "broken" and language is no longer
possible?

Angela, did I say that those who enjoy sports are bellering idiots?
No, in fact I didn't use the word idiots at all. Let alone swine. Are
you projecting?

I will stand by the fact that there are sports fans who behave
boorishly, just as there are poetry fans who behave boorishly. I love
me some football; I don't throw bottles at fans of the opposite team.
I am a big fan of certain poets; I don't flame those who hold poetic
opinions contrary to mine.

Furthermore, I realize that my post was oblique, but it was meant to
be tongue-in-cheek and sarcastic. Perhaps one of the reasons the arts
tend to be so marginalized is that poets take themselves too
seriously?

Kevin, try saying the word "surely" to yourself in an overstated kind
of way, and see if any sentence that follows that word can possibly be
taken seriously. I was joking. Not that the joke was necessarily
funny.

Come on, I was kidding Amy about using the phrase "Good Grief." Good grief!

Oh and I prefer a good pale ale and Krazy Kat to Kab and Pluto.

Dirty Movies Late at Night: Mike Hauser, Maureen Thorson & The Trusty Knife

Rust Buckle and various simpaticos from disparate America celebrate the
release of a new chapbook by Mike Hauser. Mike Hauser lives in Milwaukee. H=
e
posts his poems to dodo:(hubbahubbain78.blogspot.com). He publishes the
magazine Dodo Bird on a very inconsistent basis. He still has copies of
that, and of the chapbook Dirty Movies Late at Night (Rust Buckle), he can
give you. Maureen Thorson is the author of two chapbooks, Novelty Act (Ugly
Duckling Presse) and the forthcoming Mayport (Poetry Society of America).
She lives in Washington, D.C., where she runs Big Game Books, the tiniest
press in the world. Zack Pieper & The Trusty Knife are a band of
basement/bathroom/garage/attic songsters from Milwaukee, WI who perform an
array of eclectic rock & roll material & will be presenting their low-tech
folk-rot album Sad Contraptions Unrehearsed. Dustin Williamson is the
co-curator of this event. He edits the Rust Buckle magazine and chapbook
series. He is the author of the chapbooks Heavy Panda (Goodbye Better),
Gorilla Dust (forthcoming from Open 24 Hour Press), and Power Lunch, a
collaboration with the poet Gina Myers. B.Y.O.D.M.

Maritime Ode=20

Stein said "If fishes were wishes the ocean would be all of our desire."
Films that star the ocean by Stephanie Barber (shipfilm), David Gatten (Wha=
t
the Water Said, No. 4, What the Water Said, No. 5 and Shrimp Boat Log) and
Matt McCormick (Going to the Ocean) prefaced by a choral reading of Fernand=
o
Pessoa's poem "Martime Ode" by Stephanie Barber, Marcella Durand, David
Gatten, Murat Nemet-Nejat & Shanxing Wang.

Stephanie Barber is a filmmaker and musician who has recently moved to
Baltimore from Milwaukee, Wisconsin. She has had solo shows of her film wor=
k
at the Museum of Modern Art, NYC, the San Francisco Cinemateque, the Gene
Siskel Theatre, Chicago Il. and various other venues. Over the last ten
years David Gatten's films have explored the intersection of the printed
word and the moving image, while investigating the shifting vocabularies of
experience and representation within intimate spaces and historical
documents. In 2005 he was awarded a Fellowship from Guggenheim Foundation t=
o
continue his work on the Secret History Of The Dividing Line, A True Accoun=
t
In Nine Parts film series. The first four films in the project were feature=
d
in "Views from the Avant Garde" at the 43rd New York Film Festival in Fall
of 2005. Matt McCormick is an award winning filmmaker and director from
Portland, Oregon. He is also the founder of the video label Peripheral
Produce and is the director of the Portland Documentary and eXperimental
Film Festival. McCormick makes films that combine found and original sounds
and images to fashion abstract and witty observations of contemporary
culture. A collection of his short films, From Tugboats to Polar Bears
(which includes Going to the Ocean), can be purchased at
www.peripheralproduce.com. Marcella Durand is the author of Western Capital
Rhapsodies (Faux Press, 2001) and The Anatomy of Oil (Belladonna* Books,
2005). She swims with seals who only know her as "Clammie". Shanxing Wang
was born in Jinzhong, Shanxi Province, China, and educated at Xi=E2=80=9A=C3=84=C3=B4an
Jiaotong University. In 1991, he came to the U.S. to pursue a PhD in
Mechanical Engineering at University of California at Berkeley. Mad Science
in Imperial City is his first book. Murat Nemet-Nejat was born in Istanbul,
Turkey, and has lived in the United States since 1959. His books and
translations include the The Peripheral Space of Photography, The Blind Cat
Black and Orthodoxies, I, Orhan Veli, and The Bridge. He recently edited
Eda: An Anthology of Contemporary Turkish Poetry. Fernando Pessoa
(1888-1935), born in Lisbon, Portugal, is seen by many as one of the most
notable Portuguese authors of all time. Pessoa is unique as an author due t=
o
the prevalence of heteronyms in his writing, with few of his poems being
signed by himself. The poem "Maritime Ode" was published under the heterony=

Observing a pure and innocent child reminds me how quickly I went bad,
simply by emulating the behavior of others.  Without even realizing it, my
behavior will set an example for children--they may grow up as bitter and
depressed as I am.  It is sad to think about how life goes on.

excerpt from "Daily Negations"


Fernando Pessoa=20
from Maritime Ode

With great immediate and natural pleasure I follow with my soul
All the commercial operations needed for a shipment of goods.
My era is the rubber stamp appearing on all invoices,
And I feel that all letters from all offices
Should be addressed to me.
=20
A bill of lading is so distinctive,
And a ship captain=E2=80=99s signature so handsome and modern!
The commercial formality at the beginning and end of letters:
Dear Sirs=E2=80=94Messieurs=E2=80=94Amigos e Senhores,
Yours faithfully=E2=80=94Nos salutations empress=C3=A9es...
All of this isn=E2=80=99t only human and tidy but also beautiful,
And it ultimately has a maritime destiny: a steamer on which

The goods named in the letters and invoices.

Dear David,

  First, thanks very much for your thoughtful and generous reply - sincerely.  Unfortunately, I am only going to be brief & hurried as I'm shortly off to my next night class, along with being miserably bogged down with a sinus infection that seems to be immune to three days of antibiotics.

  First, I'll clarify my post from yesterday quickly.  In my haste to post real-time news, I clearly should have posted "baseball fans" instead of "Yankees fans" because I was trying to signal that this was a post for folks who were into baseball, which is not exclusive from folks who write poetry as someone mentioned in an earlier email otherwise I wouldn't have posted the note at all  --  anyway, I apologize for that inadvertent error.

  To qualify:  I was on the edge of my seat watching this event as it was happening right across the water from me and thought to share the sad news.  I didn't think critically about the subject line as mentioned because I simply didn't imagine anyone would think I was implying that only Yankees' fans were allowed to mourn the death of Lindle.  The idea is preposterous.  My only concern was that I was not posting a note directly-related to poetics.  I really was using "Yankees fans" to signify that this would be of interest to baseball folks.  Again, I would certainly clarify "baseball fans" in retrospect and apologize for not doing so.  Peace and any other signs of it are fully embraced and offered - thank you, David, for that gesture.

  Overall, this incident clearly raises a larger issue that David notes, though he's not alone, and has created storms on this list many times over and has possibly set a tenor that might deter folks from posting and discussing/debating poetics more freely here.  Most of this listserv is made up of strangers, close to a thousand strong.  It seems to me the problem really lies in our communal treatment of strangers.  I ask myself, What should we assume about strangers?  The tendency seems to be to assume the worst:  that they are out to show off or shine more brightly than the next; they are trying to make 'me' look bad or stupid, want to exclude me, etc. instead of assuming that they might be decent people who could have flubbed or aren't expressing themselves as well as they'd like.  We're language workers, after all.  So our approach to people we (choose to?) assume mean us harm is varied:  To attack.  To lecture.  To go on the defensive.  To belittle.  To illustrate our
 superiority and point out their own harmful intent, etc.  One need only look through the archives for some of these knock-down punches.  And so the story goes, discussions turn into less than productive, become meaningless threads to delete, and people stop participating.

  I'm an idealist, probably to a fault.  Perhaps I create my own naivete.  Nonetheless, I wonder if a more strategic and communal tact could be to assume that the strangers on this list have something in common and that they don't always mean everyone harm.  Why don't we treat them as friends with that something in common (poetry/an interest in language, culture workers, etc) and just ask about intent -- I know, "asking" is the seemingly weaker approach (in that it's not aggressive, complete with an all knowing tone).  Could we be more careful in our posts and consider the implications of our words?  Yes.  But that method is not foolproof.  Even still, I do wish, and I'm addressing everyone here, that the showing off and "cutting" that occurs here and in other realms of poetic discourse could be kept to a minimum or annihilated altogether in order to create an environment that's more conducive to friendly discussion and less concerned with assuming the worst from the next
 stranger who posts on our shared turf.

  Finally, I guess a lot of this has to do with tone, which sometimes comes across quite clearly in these emails, whereas intent does not in all cases.  I realize we like to state our beliefs and ideas firmly and strongly.  But sometimes responses here seem to be overly and overtly nasty in tone -- the cause of which is due to the assumptions about strangers that I tried to dissect above.  I don't have an answer, but rather another appeal:  can we consider how and in what tone we're answering people before we hit that send button?   I realize some on this list might thrive on making their points through sarcasm and other forms of expression; however, who ends up being excluded (or yes, removing themselves) because they don't thrive on such engagement and don't think it's worth their time to be combative in that fashion?

  I'm late and have gone on.  I'd like to say thanks again to David for his kind and considerate response; it's refreshing and thought-provoking.  Someone else has clarified backchannel that you were not alone in reading my subject line as I did not intend it, and I'm very glad you were open to discussing it.

  Amy

  p.s. I'm really not in the baseball club (the only game I've watched in the last few years was a Mets one someone took me to for my b-day in August) but David K. also invited me to be on the Boog City "Team" this year, so watch for that issue forthcoming!

  Dear Amy:

I apologize--

I hope i can perhaps explain a little and bring a peaceful understanding--

What I was writing about wasn't to create strife and dissension, angry
presumptious diatribe etc --what I was expressing was that the header
expresses a form of elitism and possesion, that Cory Lidle belongs only to
New York, and that only New York mourns this tragedy. I was saying that on
the contrary, baseball and sports fans everywhere mourn this event and know
of Lidle's career not simply as a Yankee but also as a member of the six
other teams he played for over nine years. It doesn't really have to do
with the amount of baseball information, but with the attitude of elitism
and sole possesion expressed in "Only for Yankees Fans".

(Also people are being very generous to Lidle --just a few days ago he
wasn't very popular with his teammates or many in NYC and the media as he
had come out with criticisms of the Yankees not being prepared for their
division series agsinst the Tigers and in 1995 he was a replacement player
during the baseball players' strike--a scab in other words, making him not
always the most popular guy in the clubhouse of the many teams he played
for.
None of this matters here of course, except that people on the list
have quoted stories and mentioned news about him and speculated a bit about
him, so these are a few more facts to contribute to the discussion of who he
was.) (The question of suicide was raised--i seriously doubt re Lidle but this did  really happen with a pitcher who was involved on a losing team in a divison series--the Angels who lost to the come-from behind Red Sox in 1986--i can't recall his name at the moment, very good relief pitcher, gave up dramatic home run to Dave Henderson and blamed himself for the Angels' loss--later committed suicide--never recovered from the event--)(George Bowering will know who i mean--)

Personally I have tried in all my time on this list not to be a
contributer to the sort of discourse you critique. I apologize that my
emotions as a sports fan aren't as cool as they are in other regards
but I did find the exclusiveness and elitism of the header offensive. I'm
sorry that my reply was too hasty and overboard, I really should have
phrased it far better, to say the least.

I think your response shows the miscommunication i mention above. "I
wasn't limiiting the message to per se Yankees fans"--then why write "for
Yankees fans only"? I am not "willfully misreading" your message at all--I am reading what you wrote. I can't read what your intentions were, I can only read the  words that appear on the screen.(During David Frost's interviews with Nixon, he played some of Nixon's own tapes of his conversations with his aides to Nixon, Nixon giving orders to do such and such--to which Nixon responded--"that is what I said, but that is not what I meant." Frost said--"Yes, but how can the listener know what you meant if you are not saying it?")

Baseball and poetry aren't seperate subjects--there was just the
announcement of the annual Boog City Baseball Poetry issue (I'm honored to
have been chosen for inclusion in this in the past) and Marianne Moore for
example was known for her baseball poems and devotion to her beloved
Brooklyn Dodgers. There are a great number of anthologies of baseball
writings by poets and writers. Think Jack Spicer for starters alone . . . the list is very long-- (And Virginia Woolf was a huge fan of Ring Lardner's great epistolary baseball novel You Know Me, Al--) Many poets on his list have written beautifully on baseball and can discuss it for hours on end with one, and know more than I do.
I am sorry I phrased my response so poorly because I was thinking of
how many baseball fans there are on this list whom I know of, and that a
header such as "for Yankees fans only" in such a context is shall we say
tactless and exclusive.
I also deplore the "angry presumptuous responses" you do and
apologize for giving such an impression.
The elitism here and often displayed on the list does concern me. You
introduced a topic, baseball, but for Yankess fans only. When I protest
that other fans count also, you say you didn't mean Yankees fans only per
se, (yet what you wrote is not apparently what you meant) and that "I'm
sure there's a baseball listserv somewhere" where any further discussion can
go. There's a hint of condescension--it's okay for you to bring the subject
up--but for anyone to discuss it--take it outside the nice place.
You also assert that it is "a fact that is fairly obvious" no strife
and dissension is "intended" that this event being reported is "for Yankees
fans only". (Though one would imagine if you follow baseball even a bit,
you would know how much that would rile people up--not just outside
NYC--what abt Mets fans!)
Again it is the gulf between the intention and what is there in
writing that is the miscommunication. I apologize but I can't read the
intention on an email screen--what comes across is that a public event in
which there is a great outpouring of sympathy and grief concerning a
participant in the "National Pastime" is being roped off and made the
possesion of the elite few. It's like Orwell's Animal Farm, in which all
animals are equal, but some are more equal than others.
For some strange reason, that bothers me.
I hope this makes thing clearer?
What I am trying to say is now that I understand what your intentions are
behind the words, and that I have hopefully explained what I read as the
words are printed--and one can see what the miscommunications are--
may we shake hands and say peace--or the sign of peace which you use?
bring at least one misunderstanding on this list to understanding?
all my best,
david-bc

It was just reported on WCCO news that Justin Morneau
is busy going to Minnesota Wild hockey games so that
he doesn't have to think about the disappointing end
to his wonderful season.  The rest of us are waiting
to find out if he'll need to make room for an MVP
trophy next to his roommate Joe Mauer's silver bat.
(Or perhaps he'll cart it back to British Columbia to
show off to the locals and maybe George Bowering.)

My favorite is Kenneth Patchen's "The Origin of
Baseball," which mixes poetry, baseball and politics.

That was Donnie Moore who blew the lead in game 5 of
the American League Championship Series.  I can still
picture Reggie Jackson in the dugout with his arm
around Gene Mauch moments before the home run.  Then,
after he hit, Dave Henderson jumping about 10 feet in
the air.  Donnie Moore committed suicide in July, 1989
(see this link:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donnie_Moore), after his
baseball career had come to an end.  Getting cut by
the Royals may have been done more to his spirit than
the ALCS.

Btw, where's that place in Milwaukee where folks were
watching ball?  I haven't been down there since they
tore down County Stadium.  Maybe I'll have to change
that next summer.

Many baseball folks, especially in the Midwest, chafe
at the idea of "Yankees fans" being a generic term for
"baseball fans."   The Yankees have the biggest
payroll, are always in prime time, and benefit from a
massive hype machine.  The rest of us are just playing
out in the corn fields.  But, it's alright.  Though I
had hoped the Twins would get the opportunity, the
Tigers took care of business.

Btw, I am a digest subscriber.  It'd be nice if all
poetry folks (baseball & non-baseball, Yankees fan or
not) trimmed their posts.  It'd cut down on the bloat.

peace, love and understanding (never give up!)

Marcus,

Your post seems to be in intentional bad faith... a bit of
"straw man/woman" there. But, more importantly (I think):

<The problem with "breaking the syntax" is the same as the
one with "breaking the pentameter">

"Breaking" is "disrupting," interfering. Syntax and
pentameter really aren't equivalent, and messing with
the former isn't like disposing of the latter. Syntax
is much bigger than pentameter. Syntax is an effect,
and it happens even when syntax is "broken." Pentameter
is a quantitative structure.

<-- what do you propose
to use instead?>

One look at the work of the writers mentioned--Hejinian,
Scalapino, others--shows pretty clearly, I think, that
something new is produced when they "break the syntax."
I do think there's a problem with just characterizing
their techniques negatively, in terms of avoidance,
precisely because it misses the main point, which is
to create something. At the same time, I think the
insistence that, every time someone wants to negate
something, they immediately have something with which
to replace it, is kind of insidious; it supports the
preservation of what's bad, or worn out, or exclusively
dominant, and sometimes nothing new can even breathe
while those are in unquestioned place.

...

Pound managed to write a great quantity of gorgeous
verse based on accent patterns looser than the structure
of five repeating iambic feet, patterns that took the
(indeed, often iambic) rhythms of everyday speech into
consideration, by ear. The "ear" is alive and well in
poetry since then. Meter may have been largely abandoned,
but only in the sense of regular, repeating pattern;
loads of poetry is still concerned with rhythm and sonic
richness.

Aside from the question of the comprehensiveness of your
characterization, why blame the abandonment of meter, and
the forays into the areas you mention, for the marginal
status of poetry? Mightn't it have more to do with the
rather recent tendency for "carpenters and plumbers" (some
of whom do indeed read poetry, maybe even contemporary
experimental poetry) to be told repeatedly by the mainstream
media how stupid they are, to have stupidity romanticized
as some noble, essential quality of working people, until
many perfectly quick-minded and inquisitive people,
presented with a picture of social and economic reality in
which thinking, even wily, practical, everyday inventiveness,
is made to look like a useless and counterproductive waste
of time? With the fact that "impractical" thinking is being
devalued even in the "ivory tower" of the universities?
My grandfather was an immigrant coal miner with no real
education to speak of; he and a number of other coal miners
in Benld, IL got together to read "Ulysses," Pound, Dostoevsky,
Kafka. None of these writers' "breakings" of narrative conventions,
meter, rhyme, linguistic orders marginalized their work with
regard to these "ordinary people" (a rather condescending,
classist term). Anyway, my guess is that most writers write
for themselves, their friends, and "whoever else."

And, yes, as a college-educated guy who's excited by many
"syntax-breaking" writers, I'm also interested in hearing
about things like those different types of windows, art
restoration, the color of irises, and in hearing about
them from people who actually work on them (more than I
am in reading about them, and, oh god, much more than
reading about them in the "New Yorker"). Many people
still have a broad and genuine curiosity.

Sure, "breaking the syntax" is a catch phrase, and it can
be used to give a high political evaluation to writing
without consideration of the specifics of that writing.
But it might also be used by someone who may well have
thought a lot about that writing, but didn't want to
take the time to contribute an entire essay to the
listserv.

In any case, why the vitriolic battalion of cliches?

Andy

Subject: Re: feminists who changed the world

The problem with "breaking the syntax" is the same as the one with
"breaking the pentameter" -- what do you propose to use instead? Are
women going to invent a whole new language other than English to use
in order to create a whole new literature? Will this language be
accessible to men, or will it be as obdurately feminine as those who
advocate breaking the syntax claim that the existing language is
masculine?

The "breaking the pentameter" folly ought to be a warning. The
Ford/Lowell/Pound group who fought to break the pentameter hoped and
dreamed that some new meter would emerge -- and it didn't. Instead we
have prose lineated as poetry, as the majority of generation after
generation of poets was taught to abandon meter and metaphor
altogether in favor of trying to write philosophy, social commentary,
private diaries, and essays with a ragged right edge. Where is poetry
now because of it? Disparaged and marginalized -- no longer a force
for anything in its own culture, except among an increasingly
alienated elite who find it difficult to say just what it is they're
doing, and why, to ordinary people.

Why should your plumber or carpenter or car salesman care about
"breaking the pentameter" or "breaking the syntax"? These are arcane
issues the politics of which are so vicious because the stakes are so
small, as Hutchins famously said of academic politics. Do any of you
care about the debate about argon-filled as opposed to dessicated-air-
filled insulated unit windows? About the debate about curatorial
techniques for sustaining or restoring pieces of art? About whether
black irises are really black or just dark red? About any of any
number of other strongly-fought debates among the elites of any
number of other small coteries of experts? I mean, except for as an
article to read in the New Yorker that you don't even read all of
because after a while you realize that it's all just the same sort of
politics that you're reading the New Yorker to avoid thinking about
in your own department?

Do you really think "breaking the syntax" is going to change the
world if there's no other syntax invented or available to replace it?
What, exactly, is the point of this metaphor, "breaking the syntax"?
What does it mean when it's at home? What are the consequences of
"breaking the syntax" if you succeed? Are you really advocating
inarticulate physical violence as a means of communication between
humans because the syntax has bee "broken" and language is no longer
possible?

To all who wrote about 'breaking the syntax,' it's been lively reading &,
right, I didn't have time to go into a further description as I'm in the
middle of moving. But let Lyn Hejinian & Leslie Scalapino speak for
themselves. There's a brief interview w/ them in the book about their
collaborative book-length poem Sight, from which there's an excerpt in the
anthology.
LH: "Poetry is a field of thought and information, and new modes of writing
it provide not just new thoughts but also new ways of thinking." and
"Strangeness is not at all the same as obscurity. Strangeness restores
unusualness to familiar things--making them unfamiliar so that they come to
our attention again and thus become visible. This is not a new idea--Tolstoy
used 'defamiliarization techniques' in his writing...."
"Although neither collaborations nor strangeness are feminist strategies per
se, feminism can make use of them. The collaborative process redefines the
ego in the course of redefining the nature of authorship....We are we--which
is a great relief when one is so frequently when 'I' and is bullied and
supervised as such, whether male or female....The 'we' of collaborations is
not the we of a gang; instead it can be the we of supervention, the we of
surprise."
LS: "The project is feminist, I suppose, in sometimes raising issues of
social seeing that creates boundaries of gender."

Ask Gertrude Stein.

Greetings all,

You, your students, colleagues, friends, even your mother, may be
interested o know there's some poetry on iTunes--follow the link below to
the AvantRetro cd that's available there.

"Georgie" and "Planetary Report for the Little Guy" will be of particular
interest to those with a political bent esp. as mid-term elections
approach (complete with musical accompaniment)

If you're wondering how to get your poetry on iTunes...make a cd and then
put it on CDBaby--go to cdbaby.com for details on that.  Then follow
cdbaby procedures to have them put your work on itunes and numerous other
sites that offer downloading for a small fee

and by the way it's not too early to think about the persons on your
(holiday) list who should get a cd or some poetry downloads this december

Best to all...Keep the poems flowing

Chicago Calling: A 24-Hour Arts Festival

In “Chicago Calling,” Chicago-based artists will showcase performances and
projects that involve collaborations with artists living in other
locations—here in the U.S. and in other countries worldwide. The
collaborations between Chicago-based artists and those living elsewhere
could be prepared, improvised, or a combination of both. For instance, a
Chicago-based poet will be collaborating with a musician from Niger, a
Chicago-based performance ensemble will be collaborating with a composer in
New York, and so on. Some of the performances will involve live feeds
between Chicago and elsewhere. The first “Chicago Calling” event will begin
at 12 a.m. on Wednesday, October 25, and the final event will end at 11:59
p.m. on that day. October 25 was chosen as the date of “Chicago Calling”
because it is Pablo Picasso’s birthday. This event is part of Chicago
Artists’ Month, which is organized by Chicago’s Department of Cultural
Affairs. For more more information about Chicago Artists' Month, please
visit http://www.chicagoartistsmonth.org.

Artists involved with Chicago Calling work in a range of media, including
music, painting, photography, poetry, dance, and so on. The festival’s
participants will include Mars Caulton, Fred Anderson, Daniele Cavallanti,
Tiziano Tononi, Sadira Muhammad, Jim Baker, Alan Emerson Hicks, Pam Osbey,
Eric Elshtain, Pauline Oliveros, Marian Hayes, Ed Roberson, Black Forest
Theater, Joel Wanek, Susen James, Christopher Preissing, Mars Williams,
Xianggang Delight, Jennifer Karmin, Bill MacKay, Weave Soundpainting
Orchestra, Matthias Regan, Hamadal Issoufou, Amina Cain, Joshua Manchester,
David Harrison Horton, Jayve Montgomery, Lisa Hemminger, Inouk Touzin,
Daniel Godston, Elizabeth Marino, Eric Glick Rieman, Julie Downey, Dan
Schwarzlose, Aguafuego, and others.

Performances and presentations will occur in the following Chicago venues:
Elastic, Bloom Yoga Studio, Peter Jones Gallery, Café Mestizo, WNUR, The
Hyde Park Art Center, Muse Café, The Empty Bottle, Quimby’s, Mess Hall, The
Zhou B Art Center, Loyola University, and The Meztli Gallery and Cultural
Organization.

Chicago Calling: A 24-Hour Arts Festival is being organized by Borderbend,
an arts collective. Borderbend’s mission is to promote the arts, create
opportunities for artists to explore new directions in and between art
forms, and engage the community.

The Chicago Calling Arts Festival is sponsored by The Chicago Moving
Company, The Chicago Composers Forum, and WNUR.

These are two very different things: the one is an accusation that
you think I'm not arguing what I really believe, and the other is an
assessment of whether a particular argument is sound or fallacious.
The difference is that in discussion any of us may use a fallacious
argument without deceit, but to argue in bad faith is to try to
deceive.

I didn't even come close to even implying, much less saying, that
syntax and pentameter are equivalent. I used the consequences of the
arguments for "breaking the pentameter" as an example of why it is
foolish to argue for "breaking they syntax". I pointed out that the
hopes of those who wanted to "break the pentameter" were for a new
meter, and the consequences of their attempts were to throw the baby
of poetry out with the bathwater of pentameter, and no new meter
resulted. Instead, we got prose organized into ragged right margins.
I said that those who want to "break the syntax" ought to take a
lesson from that: that if they want to "break the syntax" they ought
to have a substitue readily available because, if merely breaking the
pentameter doesn't produce an emergent new meter, you can't count on
breaking the syntax to produce an emergent new syntax. And I asked,
pointedly, whether those who want to "break the syntax" are really
prepared for eliminating verbal and written language altogether and
resorting to physical means to communicate.

Break the pentameter in English and you only ruin poetry for, I hope,
a while -- it's been a hundred years, maybe the turn back to poetry
from lineated prose has begun and we just can't see it, maybe it'll
take longer, maybe it'll never come back, who knows, but at least we
can still, more or less, talk to each other.

Break the syntax, though, and you break the language -- you make it
impossible to know what the other person means any more in even
trivial ways, and certainly not in important ones. The question is:
are those of you who want to "break the syntax" prepared for the
consequences?

There is nothing new about Hejinian's or Scalapino's work that hasn't
been done countless times before by other free verse writers. They
are not breaking anything, they're just making associational leaps
and word salads, lineating their prose arbitrarily, leaving the
reader with nothing new at all. If that's "breaking the syntax",
bring on "chopping the syntax into little bits and burning it and
then flinging its ashes into the faces of the New Formalists" since
that will probably entail leaving out a few more commas and perhaps
adding in a few line breaks. Rah.

The people who want to break things are not trying to "create
something" -- they are merely barbarians who, looking at an edifice
they can neither duplicate nor appreciate, that they cannot even add
to, enjoy breaking it because that's all they _can_ do. Not that
they're very good at it if Lyn Hejinian is going to be your example,
but still, I suppose the intent is there.

This sheds an interesting light on the discussion about metaphorical
thinking: about how low-level and non-rigorous it is. Here we are
talking about "breaking the syntax", and we each have such different
understandings about what that means or can be taken to mean, and of
what the consequences may be, that we're really talking past each
other almost completely.

Sure, it supports what's in place, but the example of how "breaking
the pentameter" did _not_ produce an emergent new meter in the
absence of a substitute devised by the breakers argues strongly that
"breaking the syntax", precisely because "breaking the syntax" is a
much bigger change, will have much bigger consequences, and no more
likelihood of an emergent change in the absence of a devised one. The
question I ask is: "Are you ready for that?"

Meter _is_ a regular repeating pattern. If there is no regular
repeating pattern what you've got is prose. That's not to say that
there isn't lots of stuff you can do with prose as an artist --
people have been getting wonderful effects with prose for thousands
of years, complete with rhythm and sonic richness -- but prose is not
poetry no matter how you lineate it.

Andy Gricevich wrote:

For two reasons: first, because the marginal status of poetry
followed the abandonment of meter, and, second, because in a hundred
years the works that are the product of abandonment of meter have
siimply failed to achieve any significant public support. People
still snicker when they're told that some relineated newspaper column
or diary entry is "poetry", and rightly suggest that there's nothing
"poetic" about it -- however broken its pentameter. In fact, the more
broken the pentameter the more they snicker.

No, because carpenters and plumbers are widely admired for their
useful and productive everyday wily practical inventiveness.

Andy Gricevich wrote:

No, because devaluing "impractical" thinking is a consequence of
postmodernity, not a cause. It was several generations ago that the
avant garde decided to break things instead of make things, and
taxpayers have, after quite a long time, actually, caught on: if
there's no value to the 2500 years of "impractical" thinking as
declared by the very people who have had the benefit of those high-
class and expensive educations, then why should we send our kids to
get such an education? Instead, teach them vocations and let them
make money and ignore all the stuff that the intellectuals are
breaking in the intellectual tradition.

Essentially the taxpayers and parents have taken a pretty good long
look at the disarray caused by intellectuals competing with one
another to break things in the intellectual tradition and have said
"We're not paying you to break things, and we're not going to send
our kids to learn to break things. We want to pay to have our kids
educated in how to MAKE things, so they have a better life than we
had."

There are always exceptions, and how nice for you that your
grandfather was one of them. An intellectual is not someone who has
an education; an intellectual is someone who has a certain cast of
character and mind, irrespective of education. There are always some,
and not all of them end up in academia. But the exception tests the
rule.  As for the four writers you mention, James Joyce certainly
tests the patience. I'm of the opinion that as an Irishman Joyce
enjoyed the hell out of perpetrating his fraud on the English, and
that it's significant that no one else has continued his practice or
even identified his theory. The consensus seems to be that Joyce is
sui generis and we ought to leave it at that. But the other two prose
writers are pretty traditional in their approaches to story-telling
and prose writing in general. They were stylists within the
tradition, though Joyce was not -- but I think Joyce was deliberately
perpetrating a fraud on English: the Irish revenge.

As for Pound, well, I think his work is like Moby Dick: everyone
refers to it and almost no one reads it. I've struggled through a
good bit of Pound, and it's a trial: the classic case of someone
trying to blurt it out there who didn't care an iota whether it got
across. If you don't like Joyce as a deliberate prankster, then how
about Joyce as the same: someone who was so absorbed in his own blurt
that he got lost in it, and ceased to care whether anything he was
saying got across.

Sure, I'm interested in hearing about such things from the people who
actually work on them, too -- but that's not what we're talking
about, is it? We're talking about writing, not about conversations in
life. Do you seek out the trade magazines in which the vicious
political tempests of glass, restoration, or iris disagreements blow
in their various teapots? Do you imagine there are little poetry
magazines in which such experts rip one another in broken syntax? How
does having a broad and genuine curiosity apply to the issue at hand.
I grant you your broadness and your genuineness, and congratulations.
Now, what's it have to do with my point that every coterie of experts
has its share of petty politics viciously pursued? Are you disputing
it?

No doubt -- but now I'm asking, and asking seriously, and pretty
nicely, though not as nicely as at first, what does "breaking the
syntax" mean when it's at home? If you don't want to write the essay
for the listserv, do you have a reference to someone who has written
an essay with which you mostly agree?

You think that was vitriolic? Yeesh. But "ballation of cliches", now
that wounds me. I thought I was criticising the cliche of "breaking
the syntax", not deploying a battalion of cliches of my own. I'd be
interested to have you list examples from what I've written that you
call cliches. I don't say there are none, but a battalion?

Anyone can publish a podcast to iTunes from their computer without
sending a CD... Any number of programs will do this including iTunes.
This seems like a lot of work.  Not sure what the reason would be for
going this route, other than collecting a few tokens here & there
when someone downloads it.

Here's a deliberate dog, gratis, for the List's dyspepsia.

_____

"Queasy in Indian Summer Unkissed"


Queasy in Indian Summer unkissed,
Surveilled by wraiths and in pretend
By Homeland Security past dumpsters
Brimming with bleached hamburgers,
Dead indigo buntings, apple turnovers,
Shredded paperwork, old Fruit of the Looms,
My thoughts from fumes turned to you, your
Sunny look when last in dooryard bloomers
Your notice of protection was served me.

The heart rages like crowds at stupid umpires!
But no! This is not our love's last flight,
Which shines through midnight starlight
And the hollow look of the village poor,
Finding no consummation or calm coda
In an inflatable doll named Rhoda.

Alackaday no, hottie, significant other, you,
My heart is profaned by an angelic chorus,
Storming the dormers of time's stagecraft
Like the lark ascending nigh the 12-gauge
Where you lay your sleeping head, gentle,
Mine, echo, mine, all mine, forever--eternity!

And in this parti pris myself despairing
O damaged plastic Cupid beyond repairing
With an echo you will come back to me,
Under the bridge where the sound is good,
Under the bridge in my neighborhood,
With the echo you will come back to me,
Echo...echo...echo...this is an echo...echo
Hello! Hello! Hello! Hello! Hello! Hello!
Echo...echo...echo...this is an echo...echo
Echo echo echo echo echo echo echo
Echo echo echo echo echo echo echo ... huh?
And the rest the angels know as silence.

Dear Marcus,

Thanks for this great response.

First off: sorry about the hyperbolic ending. It did seem like your intitial
message had an angry tone, but it's always easy to read emotional
connotations into email; in any case, you're right: "battalion of cliches"
is a definite overstatement.

I used "straw man/woman" for the following reason: you seem to be
setting up an opponent for whom "breaking the syntax" equals a hostility
to all syntax, inside or outside of poetry; for whom this disruption is a
destructive activity (admittedly, this is implied by "breaking," but that's
Ruth's term in her post, and not necessarily the term favored by the
writers in question); who has popularity/a wide readership as her goal;
who want to "do away with spoken and written language."
I don't think you can assume that any of these are the positions taken
by writers interested in poetry that takes unconventional approaches
to syntax, often to the point of dispensing with it as a primary frame.

Do you really think these writers want to do away with all syntax in
all poetry? It's simply not true.

You set up an analogic relationship between the abandonment of
pentameter and the disruption of syntax. Maybe you didn't claim
that P and S are identical, but you drew a parallel between two processes.
My claim is simply that the analogy is false.

As far as most of the rest of your post is concerned, all I can say is
that I disagree.

Many, many contemporary poets have focused on the line as a way
of setting up sonic and cognitive rhythms, of moving between interruption
and continuity, of bringing out the inner complexities of sentences and
other strings of words, and plenty of other wonders. If you don't want
to call it poetry, fine--who cares?

I find a lot more than "word salad" and "chopped-up prose" in Hejinian's
and Scalapino's work. LH's last bunch of books are full of precise observation,
significant line breaks, moves between different levels of thought I find
exhilirating, and modes of philosophical thinking that couldn't be practiced
outside poetry (because of the strictures of philosophical prose and the
failure of most philosophy that tries to break them by becoming "poetic").

<This sheds an interesting light on the discussion about metaphorical
thinking: about how low-level and non-rigorous it is. Here we are
talking about "breaking the syntax", and we each have such different
understandings about what that means or can be taken to mean, and of
what the consequences may be, that we're really talking past each
other almost completely. >

Probably right.

<first, because the marginal status of poetry
followed the abandonment of meter, and, second, because in a hundred
years the works that are the product of abandonment of meter have
siimply failed to achieve any significant public support.>

Your first point doesn't prove anything, logically speaking. As to the
second: cummings? Whitman? Williams? much of Frost? Billy Collins?
People used to read poetry widely... even unmetered poetry--even weird
unmetered poetry.

<carpenters and plumbers are widely admired for their
useful and productive everyday wily practical inventiveness>

I don't think this is true; I think intelligence is ascribed to people who do
manual labor only in a very restricted sense.

<taxpayers have, after quite a long time, actually, caught on: if
there's no value to the 2500 years of "impractical" thinking as
declared by the very people who have had the benefit of those high-
class and expensive educations, then why should we send our kids to
get such an education?>

So, no place for imagination, flexibility of thought, uses of thinking that
don't always apply to immediate practical needs? I just find this anti-
human, cold and cruel. Most of the best of human culture (and I don't
just mean "high," literary culture) has had to do with thinking beyond \
immediate "value," which especially means monetary value.

<There are always exceptions, and how nice for you that your
grandfather was one of them. An intellectual is not someone who has
an education; an intellectual is someone who has a certain cast of
character and mind, irrespective of education. There are always some,
and not all of them end up in academia. But the exception tests the
rule.>

Don't be so sarcastic. Not "how nice for me"--how nice for my grandfather,
and lots of other people (I never met the guy). Anyway, there were an
awful lot of "exceptions." Look at the history, man. Look at some high-
school exit exams from the 'thirties and 'forties. You're simply
wrong.

"Moby Dick" is great (and hilarious). Joyce is a fine prankster. Pound at
his best is gorgeous, at his worst dead boring, in the middle questionable
and often obnoxious. My opinions.

<I grant you your broadness and your genuineness, and congratulations.
Now, what's it have to do with my point that every coterie of experts

Don't be so sarcastic. I'm not trying to make myself look good. I misunderstood your point, apparently; I was trying to say that people who are interested in
innovative poetry can be interested in what goes on between specialists in
other areas. So, no, I wasn't disputing your point, which is obviously true,
as stated above.

Yes, I don't have the time to write a little essay here. I do think Hejinian's
stuff in "The Language of Inquiry" is good throughout, especially the later
things. Silliman's "The New Sentence" is really sharp, clear critical writing
that touches on this often (I particularly like his essay on Jack Spicer).
Given more leisure time, I could come up with others... so, I'm sure,
could others on this list.

But now to bed. Thanks for the reply.

These are two very different things: the one is an accusation that
you think I'm not arguing what I really believe, and the other is an
assessment of whether a particular argument is sound or fallacious.
The difference is that in discussion any of us may use a fallacious
argument without deceit, but to argue in bad faith is to try to
deceive.

I didn't even come close to even implying, much less saying, that
syntax and pentameter are equivalent. I used the consequences of the
arguments for "breaking the pentameter" as an example of why it is
foolish to argue for "breaking they syntax". I pointed out that the
hopes of those who wanted to "break the pentameter" were for a new
meter, and the consequences of their attempts were to throw the baby
of poetry out with the bathwater of pentameter, and no new meter
resulted. Instead, we got prose organized into ragged right margins.
I said that those who want to "break the syntax" ought to take a
lesson from that: that if they want to "break the syntax" they ought
to have a substitue readily available because, if merely breaking the
pentameter doesn't produce an emergent new meter, you can't count on
breaking the syntax to produce an emergent new syntax. And I asked,
pointedly, whether those who want to "break the syntax" are really
prepared for eliminating verbal and written language altogether and
resorting to physical means to communicate.

Break the pentameter in English and you only ruin poetry for, I hope,
a while -- it's been a hundred years, maybe the turn back to poetry
from lineated prose has begun and we just can't see it, maybe it'll
take longer, maybe it'll never come back, who knows, but at least we
can still, more or less, talk to each other.

Break the syntax, though, and you break the language -- you make it
impossible to know what the other person means any more in even
trivial ways, and certainly not in important ones. The question is:
are those of you who want to "break the syntax" prepared for the
consequences?

There is nothing new about Hejinian's or Scalapino's work that hasn't
been done countless times before by other free verse writers. They
are not breaking anything, they're just making associational leaps
and word salads, lineating their prose arbitrarily, leaving the
reader with nothing new at all. If that's "breaking the syntax",
bring on "chopping the syntax into little bits and burning it and
then flinging its ashes into the faces of the New Formalists" since
that will probably entail leaving out a few more commas and perhaps
adding in a few line breaks. Rah.

The people who want to break things are not trying to "create
something" -- they are merely barbarians who, looking at an edifice
they can neither duplicate nor appreciate, that they cannot even add
to, enjoy breaking it because that's all they _can_ do. Not that
they're very good at it if Lyn Hejinian is going to be your example,
but still, I suppose the intent is there.

This sheds an interesting light on the discussion about metaphorical
thinking: about how low-level and non-rigorous it is. Here we are
talking about "breaking the syntax", and we each have such different
understandings about what that means or can be taken to mean, and of
what the consequences may be, that we're really talking past each
other almost completely.

Sure, it supports what's in place, but the example of how "breaking
the pentameter" did _not_ produce an emergent new meter in the
absence of a substitute devised by the breakers argues strongly that
"breaking the syntax", precisely because "breaking the syntax" is a
much bigger change, will have much bigger consequences, and no more
likelihood of an emergent change in the absence of a devised one. The
question I ask is: "Are you ready for that?"

Meter _is_ a regular repeating pattern. If there is no regular
repeating pattern what you've got is prose. That's not to say that
there isn't lots of stuff you can do with prose as an artist --
people have been getting wonderful effects with prose for thousands
of years, complete with rhythm and sonic richness -- but prose is not
poetry no matter how you lineate it.

Andy Gricevich wrote:

For two reasons: first, because the marginal status of poetry
followed the abandonment of meter, and, second, because in a hundred
years the works that are the product of abandonment of meter have
siimply failed to achieve any significant public support. People
still snicker when they're told that some relineated newspaper column
or diary entry is "poetry", and rightly suggest that there's nothing
"poetic" about it -- however broken its pentameter. In fact, the more
broken the pentameter the more they snicker.

No, because carpenters and plumbers are widely admired for their
useful and productive everyday wily practical inventiveness.

No, because devaluing "impractical" thinking is a consequence of
postmodernity, not a cause. It was several generations ago that the
avant garde decided to break things instead of make things, and
taxpayers have, after quite a long time, actually, caught on: if
there's no value to the 2500 years of "impractical" thinking as
declared by the very people who have had the benefit of those high-
class and expensive educations, then why should we send our kids to
get such an education? Instead, teach them vocations and let them
make money and ignore all the stuff that the intellectuals are
breaking in the intellectual tradition.

Essentially the taxpayers and parents have taken a pretty good long
look at the disarray caused by intellectuals competing with one
another to break things in the intellectual tradition and have said
"We're not paying you to break things, and we're not going to send
our kids to learn to break things. We want to pay to have our kids
educated in how to MAKE things, so they have a better life than we
had."

There are always exceptions, and how nice for you that your
grandfather was one of them. An intellectual is not someone who has
an education; an intellectual is someone who has a certain cast of
character and mind, irrespective of education. There are always some,
and not all of them end up in academia. But the exception tests the
rule.  As for the four writers you mention, James Joyce certainly
tests the patience. I'm of the opinion that as an Irishman Joyce
enjoyed the hell out of perpetrating his fraud on the English, and
that it's significant that no one else has continued his practice or
even identified his theory. The consensus seems to be that Joyce is
sui generis and we ought to leave it at that. But the other two prose
writers are pretty traditional in their approaches to story-telling
and prose writing in general. They were stylists within the
tradition, though Joyce was not -- but I think Joyce was deliberately
perpetrating a fraud on English: the Irish revenge.

As for Pound, well, I think his work is like Moby Dick: everyone
refers to it and almost no one reads it. I've struggled through a
good bit of Pound, and it's a trial: the classic case of someone
trying to blurt it out there who didn't care an iota whether it got
across. If you don't like Joyce as a deliberate prankster, then how
about Joyce as the same: someone who was so absorbed in his own blurt
that he got lost in it, and ceased to care whether anything he was
saying got across.

Sure, I'm interested in hearing about such things from the people who
actually work on them, too -- but that's not what we're talking
about, is it? We're talking about writing, not about conversations in
life. Do you seek out the trade magazines in which the vicious
political tempests of glass, restoration, or iris disagreements blow
in their various teapots? Do you imagine there are little poetry
magazines in which such experts rip one another in broken syntax? How
does having a broad and genuine curiosity apply to the issue at hand.
I grant you your broadness and your genuineness, and congratulations.
Now, what's it have to do with my point that every coterie of experts
has its share of petty politics viciously pursued? Are you disputing
it?

You think that was vitriolic? Yeesh. But "ballation of cliches", now
that wounds me. I thought I was criticising the cliche of "breaking
the syntax", not deploying a battalion of cliches of my own. I'd be
interested to have you list examples from what I've written that you
call cliches. I don't say there are none, but a battalion?

DEAR FRIENDS OF CHICAGOPOSTMODERNPOETRY.COM

Please check out our new profiles this month of poets Rachel Levitsky and
Michelle Taransky and please indulge me by sending an email to
jklein@unchicago.edu with the following message that needs to be sent the U
of Chicago.

An Open Plea to the University of Chicago Poem Present Series and the U of C
Creative Writing Department.

Every year the U of C has fabulous readings by the world's great poets and
they schedule these readings at 5:30 PM on a Thursday or 1:30 in the
afternoon on a Tuesday so that the 9 million Chicagoans who don't work in
Hyde Park are unable to attend. I would ask the University to rethink its
policy and have one reading at night so that the Chicago poetry community
and general readers can have the gift of hearing the great poets that they
invite.

Marcus,
Your dismissive attitude is offensive, from the
perspective of someone unconcerned with the stakes of
this argument. It also comes across as awfully
arrogant: there might be people who love Joyce who are
likely to find you unbelievably presumptuous (not me:
I've never read Ulysses, and didn't care much for
Dubliners/Portrait). You're not dealing in sweeping
generalizations, here: more like bulldozing ones, or
something.
Apparently you write in meter? I'd love to hear who's
working in meter these days, and am genuinely curious
and pleased to hear it. But I must take exception to
the prose vs. verse war: that's a "battalion" of
cliches right there. I also don't think people are
nearly as hostile to non-metric verse as you think
they are. In fact, I think most people (the ones you
mention who scoff & scorn) probably have a harder time
reading Keats or Wordsworth than any 20th-c "free
verse".
Oh, and admittedly, I feel the same way about Pound.
But Moby Dick is a simply fabulous book.
Anyway, stop being so presumptuous, it's making you
look bad. Amy King, can you come to the rescue, here?
Alex

Well, you've gotten it wrong right at the start: it's not between
"prose and verse" but "prose and poetry", as I see it. I hold that
poetry must be in meter. Not a particular meter, but in meter. There
are lots of kinds of meter, but "free verse" specifically excludes
meter as a tool, and I think that that makes it "prose", not a
species of poetry, irrespective of how its lineated. "Verse" (all by
itself, not as a part of "free verse") is merely a dismissive word
for "bad poetry in meter" for the most part, and I reject it as a
useful term in this discussion.

Sure, that's why they have Keats and Wordsworth and Swinburne
memorized. Oh, not all of the poems, but poems by them.

Sorry, I like being presumptuous. It prompts people to write back and
make their own cases for their own views, and I find other peoples'
views very interesting.

If true, it's me making me look bad; what's that to you?

What's Amy King got to do with it? Is she someone who has made
herself look bad and now regrets it and goes around giving advice on
how not to make yourself look bad -- or recover from it? Some kind of
intervention? Advice on being a Recovered Bad-Looker?

PLEA TO THE U OF CHICAGO



DEAR FRIENDS OF CHICAGOPOSTMODERNPOETRY.COM

Please check out our new profiles this month of poets Rachel Levitsky and
Michelle Taransky and please indulge me by sending an email to
jklein@unchicago.edu with the following message that needs to be sent the U
of Chicago.

An Open Plea to the University of Chicago Poem Present Series and the U of C
Creative Writing Department.

Every year the U of C has fabulous readings by the world's great poets and
they schedule these readings at 5:30 PM on a Thursday or 1:30 in the
afternoon on a Tuesday so that the 9 million Chicagoans who don't work in
Hyde Park are unable to attend. I would ask the University to rethink its
policy and have one reading at night so that the Chicago poetry community
and general readers can have the gift of hearing the great poets that they
invite.

This is such a tired discussion.  I feel as if Marcus wants us all to
revisit 1965 or some such, and I'm not esp. eager to engage in a
discussion with someone who seems to feel that his (that's yours,
Marcus) proper aim here is to parse each and every snippet written in
response to him.  That kind of attention kills active exchange, b/c
it's difficult to see the forest for the trees, finally, but also b/c
it treats dogged scrutiny as a virtue, and lists such as this have
never been esp. well suited to micro-analysis of that sort.

So I'm sorry but I simply must wax bibliographic:

First:  To my way of thinking, Fredman's Poet's Prose:  The Crisis in
American Verse ought to be essential reading wrt this question of
prose v. poetry.  I don't get the impression that Marcus has troubled
himself with Fredman's argument, and again, as Andy suggests, we
can't very well rehearse entire booklength discussions in this space.

Secondly:  Rasula, in The American Poetry Wax Museum, rather ably
demonstrates what social criteria are at stake in forcing poetry
underground, within academe at least.  Those forces have little to do
with meter and the like, and what happens in the fifties in academe
has much to say as to where we are now.  Read Rasula's chapter two,
which is something like 250 pp long, as I recall.

Thirdly:  Antin, by the early seventies, had helpfully pushed the
prose/poetry applecart in the other direction, viz., that we ought
perhaps to consider poetry as the larger of the two categories, to
which (grammatical, mechanical) rules are applied that yield prose.

Now if this latter is agreed upon -- I wrote IF, but we can at the
very least entertain it, yes? -- then we might similarly consider the
application of metrical rules to language as yet another subset of
poetry, which latter (admittedly) begins to make of poetry (aside
from the connotation of poiesis) something akin to that fuzzy term,
"language."  But I'd rather risk collapsing/conflating the two
domains (i.e., poetry and language) than restrict poetic license to
the application of accentual-syllabic ya-yas.

The fact remains (and it is a fact) that much "prose" has been
written in the past century that simply doesn't work like SVO prose,
and this departure from grammatical convention has often drawn more
attention from poets (and poetry outlets) than from prose (narrative
or fiction) writers.  File that under "the social mechanics of
publishing," and we can talk about this, if you like.  Ergo the
thread around here, TODAY, on "breaking the syntax" (shorthand,
certainly) which nobody to my knowledge is hallucinating as meaning
"throwing syntax out the door" (one is always writing against
something, with resistance *to* something) or "changing our
social/cultural institutions simply by the stroke of a keyboard."
For one, to suggest as much would be to mistake short-term,
incremental change for long-term change.  At the same time, to deny
the (artistic and social) achievements of radical modernism or
feminism or -- would require considerably more wattage than is
implied in a discussion of syntax and meter.  That some have argued
at times somewhat too vigorously for the correlation twixt social
change and artisic innovation tends to be (this is the view from
afar, as it were) an aspect of the types of social ferment in which
such changes tend (I say tend) emerge.

Now we can argue that a prose is a prose is a prose, but I for one
would rather that we imagine such
innovative/experimental/unconventional/hybrid work, at the very
least, as troubling a distinction that will, I daresay, not be
resolved by said ya-yas, above.  Again, I would myself prefer a
discussion of marketplace dynamics, say -- the materialities of
publishing -- b/c we'd at least then be grounded, collectively, in
something tangible.

Please don't parse me, Marcus -- I don't think I can bear it.  And if
you do, I can't guarantee I'll even read it, b/c ars longa, old chap.

Best,

Joe

Hi Alex,

  There’s usually a time and place for an effective agent provocateur; in this listserv setting though, declaring one’s self such, even indirectly, is typically not about promoting discourse so much as it is a guise that gives the “provocateur” license to behave badly, making bawdy and rude statements without concern for who he offends and what he misrepresents (I also liked your bulldozer metaphor, by the way).  There are a few in the poetry community who play the A.P. strategically well and with decent results (to call the Bad Guys out ultimately), but on listservs, it’s mostly a ruse and an ego-driven routine.

  I think the easiest response is to disengage, since the provocateur isn’t so interested, as he puts it, in what you think, but rather, is interested in setting the terms of the discussion so that his position seems advanced, a position that is usually reactionary and relies on you expending your energy to thrive and get notice.

  But what Marcus claims is true:  he can be worse and has been.  If you don’t want to wade through the archives, click on this link for a small but telling historical account of one “discussion” he provoked and a sample of his self-professed notoriety:  http://cipherjournal.blogspot.com/2006/06/i-will-name-names-marcus-bales-doesnt.html

  I’m starting to sound like “Dear Abby,” so I’ll sign off now and get back to grading essays and an ongoing sinus infection I just can’t seem to shake—

  Be well,

  Amy

Not much there, but will post more shortly: some poems
I don't know what to do with, and other things. A

-- this is a belated reply to Marcus' thought-provoking post -- belated
because i'm pretty ill today, which has kicked my brain off-gear -- it seems
to me to be a little bit of a waste to characterize this debate about
"breaking the syntax" in terms of the personalities involved, it sort of
cloaks the issue of what's at stake in breaking or dismantling things if
nothing is readily available to replace what's broken

as Marcus wrote
"those who want to 'break the syntax' ought to take a lesson from [free
verse]: that if they want to 'break the syntax' they ought to have a
substitute readily available because, if merely breaking the pentameter
doesn't produce an emergent new meter, you can't count on breaking the
syntax to produce an emergent new syntax.  And I asked, pointedly, whether
those who want to 'break the syntax' are really preparing for eliminating
verbal and written language altogether and resorting to physical means to
communicate."


 -- anyone can relate to the concept of broken health and that's as good a
place to refer as any i guess -- in illness, one doesn't generally "get"
something to serve as a kind of crutch in place of the lost health -- or on
the other hand through medicine and kin networks you do, but there is a real
distance between the crutch and the lost health -- instead you get a kind of
void, and it may take years to learn what's in that void -- if a knee injury
takes you out of cross country running for example -- not unlike the void of
silence, what is in silence, well, no one can tell you, but it's possible to
go to silent places and spend days, weeks, for some lucky people even
longer, listening, to find out -- but these are kind of obvious things --
it's just that it's possible to engage in a dialogue with absence and this
in itself is an important dialogue to have, and to do that, you have to
create a void -- or have one thrust on you, depending on the circumstances
-- so i wonder why there is such momentum to get to what replaces what's
broken -- except maybe that the professional machine means that we need to
point to products of our productivity or whatever -- but what if there is
nothing to put in place of what's broken -- really, nothing  -- does that
mean not to break a kind of aesthetic for example -- i don't think so -- i
think the void still holds the memory of what was before it and in that you
get a certain kind of void -- US education is interested in producing
students who make a good living -- why on earth has everybody let poetry get
coopted into that -- anyone can see what it's done -- we are making products
and that at least threatening to become more important than thinking about
what's there -- at least in the minimal terms if you characterize the kind
of professional trends that go into most careers -- if things are getting
broken and there's nothing to replace them -- that's what's there and that
can be thought through -- if for example a government destroys peace in a
nation -- something has been lost -- that condition of peace -- without
taking seriously that there is a void of some type instead of peace, and not
simply violence as the next and inevitable step, it seems to me that
thinking about the vacuum that follows the destruction is closer to the
peace that once existed than simply moving right along to the next thing --
so i'm kind of trying to say that there can be things to say about a
destroyed place when nothing comes to fill the void -- and maybe it's not
relevant to anything at all and quite cold but in fact it is worth thinking
about as in how far can you go to get inside nothingness -- can you sit
alone and go to the moon and no one can say it's not possible or it's just
imagination no one knows what's there because the things we are looking at
is the new products rather than the possibilities of places where there are
no products -- as in places where there are no jobs, or fields where there
are no crops -- what is a void -- it is not possible in our capitalist
system for such an inquiry to become a dominant view because it takes
seriously the possibility that as Boethius said where there is nothing,
nothing comes, -- but it is also possible that Boethius was wrong -- it
matters a great deal if you dismantle something what you mean by that and
this is why i wrote in, with apologies since i think this is probably a
little foggy -- but as everyone who has contributed to this conversation has
said something to the effect that breaking the syntax is important to deal
with in some way -- and i just felt i should chime in that yes it is but why
is there so much attention to the next product when there may be other
elements to consider in terms of what is going on --

-- this is not a comprehensive response to Marcus' post but at least it
takes issue with a small part of it
-- now i'm off to lurking,

peace,

heidi

I have sympathy with Marcus' argument because I hate lazy or
self-congratulatory writing. Rather than dismiss his claims
as antiprogressive or emblematic of an oppressive master
narrative, we'd all benefit by considering the ways his
opinion is spot on, and possibly so progressive it seems
antique.

Sure there's a lot of superb
"innovative/experimental/unconventional/hybrid work," as Joe
called it, and women are not the privileged gatekeepers of
it. (Consider _Forge_ by Ted Mathys.)

There's also the tedious "old spontaneous me" of Whitman
imitation, those who congratulate themselves on their
innovative or democratic style as a way of hiding technical
deficiencies. Get out the old bongo drums, snap your
fingers, then walk home amid the blowing trash and waste of
a million egotists who never can be wrong.

In part we are all victims of the Enlightenment myth where
progress is an overthrow of tradition. We overly value
people who innovate and "think outside of the box," missing
the fact that most progress has been built on tradition, as
science builds on other science. Different is usually not
better, contrary to our desire for it to be otherwise, and
for every Copernicus there are hundreds of crackpot
cosmologists with theories of hidden time-eating planets and
angry thinking cyclopean stars.

Yet wouldn't it be swell if we were the misunderstood genius
who changes language? Such a pleasant narcissistic fantasy!
So much easier to entertain than a life of honest and
passionate writing.

Best wishes to all,
Eric

This is in reply to Heidi Arnold's post.

  Heidi, right on.

  A thought that I find particularly interesting in what you wrote (assuming you meant it,
  and it's not just me reading into it), could be stated as follows:

  When something's negated, the absence that's left isn't just indeterminate, vague;
  it's an absence/void with a particular shape--the shape of what was there, which is,
  at the same time, the shape of the environment of what was there, without that
  thing in it.

  Three reflections in relation to this, continuing to play (and there is a playfulness here)with the spatial metaphor:
  1) If something's negated, and something does replace it, the new thing might be in
  a different place.
  2) There might be many instances of a thing, in many different places, and some might be negated, others not.
  3) There's not just negation, but also displacement, overlap and melding.

  'Zat's all.

  cheers,

  Andy

Sheesh, Marcus, that rules out a large hunk of the world and history, those

Good going, son -- you've just nuked more than half of the human race with
one strike.  <g>

Reread Aristotles poetics.  And Sidney's Defence/Apology for poetry.  Both
distinguish the poetry/prose opposition from the prose/verse opposition, and
proffer a poetry/verse one.  Those who disagree with your statement above
(if such intellectually benighted figures exist) disagree in august company.

I'm putting together old thoughts of mine about
various poems, one of which is Gertrude Stein's
"incline."  For some reason, I didn't quote the poem
in my thoughts about it.  I was sure it was one of her
buttons but couldn't find it among them--or anywhere
else.  I'm fairly sure it's short.  Anyone have the
text?  Much thanx to anyone who could post it.

"it's not between
"prose and verse" but "prose and poetry", as I see it. I hold that
poetry must be in meter. Not a particular meter, but in meter. There
are lots of kinds of meter,"


What exactly does this mean? Could you give me the "meter" of Whitman or
Dickinson or Creeley, etc.,beyond some generalities.

In fact, one of the essences of American poetry, maybe from its very
beginning, is its subversion of the distinction between poetry and prose.
There is a greater connection between  Dickinson, Hawthorne, Melville, and
Thoreau, for example, than any of them to Longfellow.

Have you not fallen for the chestnut that the iambic is the "natural" beat
of English, having even an additional, even religious absoluteness,"because
it imitates the rhythm of the heartbeat?

I used to hear this nonsense thirty, forty years ago. I would even say, the
iambic is the most "unnatural," the most "poetic" of speech.

You should read D. H. Lawrence (a very "bad" English poet) on American
Literature.

Ciao,

I am putting together a poetry workshop description for relatively
sophisticated folks who are 50 and over.
Can anyone - whether you have led workshops on this level or not - suggest a
good  'broadband' and affordable anthology?
I will be most appreciative. Unless you want to make your knowledge
available to a larger swathe, I will happily take info and ideas back

Thanks so much,

 >>Nicholas I was not that benevolent, Eric.

Well I defer to your superior knowledge of the subject,
Larissa; in fact, I'm happy to be corrected by you.

For List members who may not know it, Larissa Shmailo is one
of the best translators of Russian poetry. I won't argue
with her.

Don't take my word for it. Go to page 4 of
http://www.ata-divisions.org/SLD/PDF/SlavFile-Fall-99.pdf

and read how her translation of Pushkin's "I loved you once
..." compares with better known translators like Babette
Deutsch, Walter Arndt, and Mark Suino. (I've only had a
couple years of college Russian, maybe enough to sound out
the words, but enough to see that her translation sings
while others clatter.)

Andy,

Thanks for your post -- sure, i'll play -- tho maybe with a littel more
Guinness this would be more coherent -- the extent to which something is
meant -- to talk about the intentionality of statements -- they have a life
of their own regardless of intentionality -- this could really go off the
rails i imagine because there are so many ways to mean or sort of mean or
not mean or misintend something -- to put that under scrutiny -- well as
Daley would say, go ahead and scrutin it --

-- so yeah i did mean what i posted, that a void retains the shape of what
was before it -- that as you put it, 'when something's negated, the void has
a particular shape'

-- but does 'shape' need to mean spatiality? -- just playing with these
ideas -- in deference to your post which was clearer than mine i think --
but i'd be interested to hear why the void has to be associated with a
spatial metaphor, maybe it's an obvious question

-- still i would say that your spatial metaphor has explanatory power --
this seems to me to be the nature of peace, when peace is negated, the site
of violence retains the shape of peace -- in a geographical sense -- so i
mean it in the strong sense that the void has an ontological existence on
the terms of what existed before it-- i have to test this in point of fact
and i'm working on that one
-- your formulation suggests that the void does not allow the new thing in
the same space, whereas my formulation would say the void does allow for the
new thing, but the new thing never occupies the ontology of the void itself
-- i simply question whether hosting the new thing is the purpose of the
void --
-- i agree with your point that the binaries around negation can exclude
"many instances" and "overlap and melding"
-- to play with these ideas a little more, should deserts be left empty, and
forests undeveloped -- should governments at peace, however different from
democracy they may be, be left alone -- if the desert knows things, how is
it possible to find out what the wilderness knows if it gets filled with
other things -- then it knows the new things, and not the old things

-- maybe this is clearer on my blog -- well anyway everyone feel free to
drop by, and let me know if you have comments

Kenneth Koch wrote and edited a book about teaching poetry to older people.  He did it in a nursing home.  Unfortunately, I don't remember the title, although it was published by Teachers and Writers so you could contact them.  It's very useful.  I used it when teaching at a senior center some years ago.  It includes poems by the participants in Kenneth's workshop. Regards, Tom Savage

Everyone--


My new new book is just out, BIG CRISIS.  Here's a link to the
publisher's page about the book with a shot of the cover, a sample poem
& blurbs:



http://www.hubcapart.com/ink/chapnate.htm


BIG CRISIS is a series of ekphrastic/collage poems, each responding to 4
or 5 different visual sources, either riffing on particular visual
elements of the pieces, or through trying to create/force a
narrative...all as a kind of backdrop for other aims.  In all cases, the
source material is not referenced directly - but just so you know, I'm
talking about 1960's comic book covers!

Please check it out.

I'm glad you finally clarified that this is the title of a book.  Only the book, fortunately.  Feminists haven't changed the world yet, as anyone who has visited the developing world could tell you regarding the status of women in poor countries.  What feminists have accomplished, so far as I can see, is to make life slightly better for middle class women in American and possibly Europe and allowed them to call themselves ms. if they don't want to call themselves miss or mrs. As the problems of women generally are compounded by class, mere gender mobilization doesn't solve their problems.

isn't that the point of the career feminist to make sure that everyone understands that they are more important than the coffee lad or shop girl

  that they are free of the confines of class and customs

  that they can behave as badly and carefree as their male yuppie/academic/ counterpart

  and they deserve it cuz you know their female or middle class or both

I guess it's the point of the career anti-feminist to make sure everyone
understands that they are more hip than those old outdated feminists --
that it's okay that Bukowski punched an occasional disposable female in
the face because, you know, he was *working-class* and everybody knows
there's no such thing as a working-class feminist anyway.

I am going to say this very, very slowly so that some of you will
understand: Feminism is also about stopping violence against women. Like
rape. One in six US women -- and yes, this is certainly even worse in
the developing world -- has been the victim of an attempted or completed
rape. Like me. 67% of us knew our assailants. Feminism says: We are not
your fucktoys. Poor women are not your practice grounds for sadism. Rich
women are not your practice grounds for sadism. Fuck "Soul on Ice." Fuck
"A Clockwork Orange" (the movie in popular culture). NO MEANS NO. That
is feminism too. Get it?

Access to health care for poor women. That is feminism. Time off from
Wal-Mart or whatever for new mothers so the "squat in the fields, give
birth, go back to work" paradigm is no longer dominant. That is
feminism. No more genital cutting to ensure female "purity." That is
feminism. No more honor killings. That is feminism.

And yeah, no more default assumptions that poet = man, that's feminism too.

Gwyn,

Appreciate your thoughts, I would like to add, tho:

Access to health care for poor women. That is feminism. Time off from
Wal-Mart or whatever for new mothers so the "squat in the fields, give
birth, go back to work" paradigm is no longer dominant.

these also loop into class issues (which i think you are aware of "everybody
knows
there's no such thing as a working-class feminist anyway") which also need
to be discussed, especially in the art/poetry world as it seems class is
more neglected then what generally qualifies as 'identity politics'.

Wow, I'm like really impressed -- and all along I thought Bukowski was
just like one of those loudmouth drunks who sidles up to you in a bar
when you're trying to drink in peace and yammers away at you about how
interesting and deliciously degrading his day was and never notices
that you're trying your best not to pay attention to his boring rants
that he seems to think are pearls of wisdom because he's used to
throngs of wannabe and far-gone drunks alike drooling over his every
word.  Now it turns out he, like, punched people out like a REAL MAN,
and not only that, he didn't discriminate.  Golly gee!  That sure is
something to emulate -- why, even listening to it sends a delicious
frisson up my little middle-class spine right into my tiny little
middle-class mind!  I think I'll go back and drink a gallon of cheap
wine and puke the results onto my notebook.  Just like Bukowski!  And
anyone who doesn't like it -- well, I'll beat his ass, or preferably
hers (no political correctness here, believe you me, yes siree).

Thanks, Mr. Primeau, you made my goddamn day.  I'm feeling more macho
already.

Before an illness has made it impossible for her to do so, my sister was a
very long time activist with the concerns Gwyn writes of --her main concern
along with physical vioence was economic violence--namely--ERA--she believes
that until women are equally paid for the same work all the nice new words
in the world from men are meaningless.  "Talk is cheap"--i.e. free--what
counts at the end of the day is the money you have earned to live on.  And
when you take home less than a man for the same work--what does this tell
you?  To her it is another form of continaul physical violence--because it
affects your daily physical life--what you can afford to eat, pay for where
you live, how much heat you have, your electircity, transportation, health
care, education, clothing, children's needs, everything is affected.  Being
paid less is being physcially beaten down and in turn psychologially beaten
down.  No matter how high you may rise on the stairway to the stars, you are
always the lower class.  "Equality ain't just a word--it's a number, too"
she says.

-- "career feminists" and the like, and this coming on the back of an
assertion that feminism hasn't "changed the world" b/c it hasn't
changed every fucking square inch of the planet.  As if feminists and
other like-minded souls who are trying to contribute to such, what,
change, who are aware of their own liabilities and have been
activating over them (and writing about them) for decades now, need
to be told such things.  Or as if those who march solely under the
banner of economic class or ecological awareness or what have you
don't bring to the table their own ideological or pragmatic
shortcomings.

Or maybe, this list has become so intellectually bankrupt that IT
needs to be the place to air such truisms?

Next, b/c a self-avowed feminist argues in defense of feminism to say
that men shouldn't be hitting women, and has the unmitigated gall
(right?) of bringing in Bukowski, a man rushes in (where angels fear
to tread) to suggest that Bukowski's behavior was, after all, doled
out both to women AND men.  I take it this points to a sort of equal
opportunity form of abuse, which (one can only guess) is meant to
debunk the claim that Bukowski, like Cleaver, ought to be held
accountable for his misogyny.

Or are we to presume that there's no such thing as misogyny?  I'm all
over class issues myself, but why would anyone imagine that feminists
haven't been all over class issues?  Nick is right -- READ A BOOK by
a feminist published in the last, oh, two decades.

We're getting very close here to the point at which someone will pipe
up to say that, heck, career feminists in particular should be
slapped around a bit for being, in particular, career feminists.
Does it need to be said that a discussion of feminism isn't reducible
to the masculinist claim that some people could profit from having
their asses jacked (both metaphorically and otherwise)?  I "come from
a place" where I can get behind such a questionable notion (i.e.,
ass-jacking) -- but that notion has little to do with discussions
about feminism.

And honestly, to be a bit testy, or testicular, about it, there would
seem to be ample candidates on this list for ass-jacking
(metaphorically and, one can only surmise, otherwise).

At any rate, I'm just stunned at the intellectual depths embodied in
this list of late.  Read carefully:  depths.  Some people around here
should be ashamed of themselves, really, but shame around here seems
at times to be as scarce a commodity as sustained thought.  And what
to do about *that* is anyone's guess.

Don't be a prick, Chris. I was just pointing out a truth: Bukowski was a
violent -- and, as you so bluntly pointed out, wet-brained -- individual. I
wasn't excusing his actions, or even trying to explain them.

Additionally, I don't find much value in his laughable bar room machismo, I
haven't read his work in ages, and unless I was a half a dozen beers under,
I don't imagine I would have had very much pleasure chewing the fat with him
in real life.

In other words, I'm not defending the guy. Far from it.

He was a mediocre poet with a mediocre mind -- but a decent sense of humor,
which is something rare amongst men of words. And that's why he's so
attractive to many people, and I can't really fault it.

Now quit the strawmen. K thnx bye.

Poets In Need Benefit at Small Press Traffic

Friday, October 20, 2006 at 7:30 p.m.


Small Press Traffic is pleased to host a reading and reception benefiting
Poets In Need’s Philip Whalen Memorial Grants. Featured readers are PIN Board
members Norman Fischer, Lyn Hejinian, and Michael Rothenberg.

Norman Fischer’s books include Slowly But Dearly from Chax Press.

Lyn Hejinian’s books include The Fatalist from Omnidawn.

Michael Rothenberg is the editor of Philip Whalen’s Selected Poems and
Collected Poems.

Leslie Scalapino’s books include Zither & Autobiography from Wesleyan UP.

Poets In Need is a non-profit organization providing emergency assistance to
poets who have an established presence in the literary community as innovators
in the field and a substantive body of published work. Assistance is given
only in cases of current financial need that is in excess of and unrelated to
the recipient’s normal economic situation and that is the result of recent
emergency (due, for example, to fire, flood, eviction, or a medical crisis).


Refreshments will be available. All of this evening's proceeds will benefit
Poets in Need.

 >>Being paid less is being physcially beaten down and in

Yet surely the greatest offenses against women are being
perpetrated under Sharia law in Islamic states? And surely
the eradication of institutional oppression of women by
fundamentalist Islamic theocracies should be the prime
concern of thoughtful feminists? I noticed Gwyn mentioned

Or does a subverted multiculturalism mean we ignore the beam

On rape, for example, Islamic fundamentalist states like
Iran mandate forced marriages between 12 year old girls and
40+ year old men. For other horrors, consult Nafisi's
_Reading Lolita in Tehran_ as a feminist tract.

Why the moment people begin to speak of conditions in the United States are
they swfitly told horrors are much worse under Islam?
Mimimize mothers, duaghter, sisters here and maximize horrors in countries
who regimes we are at war with or support or do nothing about--and are
Islamic only?
Here in Milwaukee on Labor Day an eleven year old girl was raped by 19
men--the girl had already been sexually abused since very young by her
father.  Every six seconds there is violence to women in this country.
Rape and violence towards women is a prime concern everywhere it
happens--every instance of it--next door, down the street, all over the
world.  To tell people to divert their attention and direct it elsewhere far
away where they can have little immediate effect --let alone only in Islamic
countries only--
Do you see/hear the implications of what you write?

what is a career feminist -- a feminist with a career?  someone who =
makes
money from feminism?  I suppose maybe someone who teaches women studies =
or
writes some of that really lucrative feminist poetry is actually what =
was
meant?

what if a "shop girl" were important -- anyway, clerks used to have to =
sleep
in the stores -- up to the 30's, I think, my husband's (quite =
patriarchal,
thank you very much) grandfather still slept at a jewelry store during =
busy
periods, because he couldn't buy a car or afford a room at the Y and he
couldn't get home after the streetcar stopped running -- this sort of =
thing
made for obviously not very woman friendly workplaces (although analysts =
and
programmers still sleep under their desks now...)

scripture is the *complete* library of not just the poor, but those not
knowing there are other options, religion is the philosophy, recitation =
/
public speaking is the literature

what if islam hadn't picked up cliterodectomy from African =
anti-matriarchal
cultural practices?  this is all about reading culture (hey, and some of =
the
same infibulation's done in the west, and by "hip and cool" folks)

what if islamists actually followed the Koran instead of the hadith?  =
what
if Christian fundamentalists actually read the entire bible?  this is =
all
about textual interpretation and canonicity

what if mohammed had stopped his recitation after his (first) wife died;
even his wife Aisha said that some of his later recitations were =
certainly
very convenient for his current marital and political situations, he is
known to have recanted several such during his lifetime, and a lot of =
these
he said only applied to "prophet's wives" -- this is all about what is
recited, what is revealed, sexual politics as thinking and hearing and
culture becomes writing

what if women were able to recite, or pray (sorta close to poetry, that)
without inciting their own rapes, for which they would be executed,=20

to pray in public, to speak, to "have their names in public" -- female
writers and artists publishing, displaying, or signing works are in =
danger
of having done something which dishonors the men in their family -- why?
because it is not safe to reveal *anything* even thoughts or feelings, =
if
you are female -- how is that not a poetry-related issue? having just
listened to a lot of AZ religious radio ranting against the ACLU, how is
free speech not a poetry related issue?  does anyone see how
private/institutional/corporate spaces, such as malls, Wal Mart, etc., =
are
now "safer" for "woman and children" because there are different =
standards
of acceptable (to the men who are "responsible for them") speech in them =
as
opposed to oh, a park?

and in this particular situation, this is very much different than Anne
Bradstreet's publication history or the modesty topos of many women =
writers
(there's also a reverse effect, in which western female scholars tend to
list their awards and degrees -- to "super-professionalize" their
accomplishments -- and now not being "casual" about these hard-won =
career
markers can work against them) -- how is publication, public =
dissemination,
and accomplishment not a poetry-related issue?

these are not class issues so much; there's long been interesting work
investigating the ways in which women have more economic and social =
class
mobility because their childbearing and marital status and family =
position
has such a direct effect on this, as opposed to men's class status, =
which
tends to be relatively independent of these, and comparatively static

if you consider feminism to be a philosophy, the ways in which it deals =
with
social advocacy directly don't seem quite as central to the thing;=20

of course feminism has a history, and a large part of that history has =
to do
with just this sort of "isn't animal rights a lot more important than
feminism *right now*, isn't abolition *more important* than equal rights =
for
women and men for the time being; "how can feminism be right if =
individual
women have prejudices"; "how can feminism be right if not all women =
_want_
equal rights" -- and many of these considerations have been under =
discussion
-- as far as poetry is concerned -- on this list -- which has a history

of course the lack of women's voices here has always been deeply
problematic, and has led to the founding of two other lists, one which =
men
joined and tend to over-post on, but there's also been a lot of =
discussion
about what "important" poetry is or could possible mean

All best,
Catherine Daly
working on my 2000 page hysteria poem...

Eric, if you seriously, for one moment, think that the issues facing
women in *just* the US today (and our trade neighbors -- think of women
maquiladora laborers, if only once) are merely a "mote," then I submit
that you are the Kaspar Hauser of the 21st century and have, until
recently, been living in a cave. Congratulations on your release.

Man, oh, man, today seems to be the logical-phallacy day on Poetics.
Because feminist women and men have not fixed every scrap of the
totality of world culture by ourselves, we are told we have made *no*
difference. Because I explain that yes, feminism has to do with issues
such as health and bodily safety that affect all classes of women
(access to health care, safety measures, and good lawyers, one notes, is
exponentially harder for poor women) I am told I have just accused a
male in the conversation of himself being a rapist.

Surprise -- you may already *be* a feminist, if not a "career" one
(whatever that means -- I guess one who has the temerity to do feminist
things and/or write a book about people doing feminist things). Do you
respect the rights of women to be safe, healthy, respected, and equally
paid for the same amount and competency of labor? Are you not
particularly uneasy to be operated on by a woman surgeon, or guarded by
a woman cop? If asked your opinion of a new female co-worker, would your
response be likelier to be something job-related than "I'd hit that"?
Congratulations! Gooble-gobble, we accept you, one of us!

Yes, we want each. and. every. damn. woman. to. be. free. Yes, it chaps
our bras (you didn't think we wore them, did you?) about women in
sweatshops, women in occupied Tibet, women being denied asylum for
fleeing genital cutting. If your particular area of concern, like that
of Mr. Yost, is girls suffering forced marriage at or before puberty,
then for fuck's sake do something about it! Help come up with ideas for
what to do about traditional crap treatment of women under religious
fundamentalism. Then help carry them out. Then, bada-bing, you're a
practical feminist, without even having to listen to any Ani DiFranco
records.

But to sit on your ass at a computer in the US and moan because bombing
the shit out of Afghanistan has not abolished the burqa... please.

I started this thread because I was perplexed by the phrase "feminist
in its breaking the syntax," which I thought claimed rather more than
it delivered while appealing to a theory that all constraints reflect
a patriarchal prehistory. Mildly provocative on my part, at best.
What's unfolded from that is pretty astounding--we've apparently not
arrived at a moment when civil discussion about gender issues is possible.

OK, here's what I think. Modern feminism arrived on the scene in
middle class Europe and America (including, by the way, much of Latin
America) at a propitious historical moment. Within the middle class
the traditional division of  labor and the power that goes with it
had become manifestly obsolete by WWII, despite the reaction of the
late 40s and 50s. As a result, massive social change within the
middle class happened, in historic terms, with astonishing speed and
lack of violence. Compare with the empowerment of the middle class
(French Revolution), colonies (US and Latin American Revolutions, and
into the present day), and the ending of slavery (US civil war, for
one). In a bit more than a generation middle class women have come to
be a majority of university students, new PHDs, new LLDs and MDs, and
are quickly approaching at least parity in MBAs. The places that hire
people with those degrees haven't notably lowered their payscales.
And we will likely have a viable woman candidate for president of the
US (to join the women who have been heads of state in make your own
list of countries).

I'm not implying that there were no sacrifices and no struggle, just
that the situation could have been a lot worse with less success in
another place and time. As it remains in other social classes in the
industrialized and post-industrial world, and as it does in much of
Latin America, Africa, and Asia. Simply, feminism has been less
successful in places where the resistance is greater. And the
resistance is greater in places where for many people traditional
divisions of labor are, or at least seem to be, still functional.

So by all means we should do everything in our power to aid in the
empowerment of women wherever they are. But that empowerment will hit
a wall of resistance as long as larger social conditions remain static.

Muhammad Yunus and his Grameen Bank (winners of this year's Nobel
Peace Prize) is a case in point. Most of his microloans have been to
home-based businesses run by women. The women have disproportionally
invested their earnings in schooling for their daughters as well as
their sons, who will become advocates for more of same. The relief
from the most grinding of poverty and the creation of disposable
income, and the increase in education of both men and women, are
likely to have an impact on all of the horrors we all know about. And
it will of course expose more people to feminist ideas. Maybe in 20
or a hundred years we will no longer be able to separate the impact
of feminist political action and thought from this kind of change in
the lives of the poorest. Which would be fine by me--if things
improve the argument will be academic anyway. But I doubt that there
will be much improvement in the lives of women, whether in working
class America or among the destitute in Bangladesh, without the
socioeconomic change I'm talking about.

Yes, Kenneth Koch's:
I Never Told Anybody / Teaching Poetry Writing in a Nursing Home

Which was after, Wishes, Dreams and Lies / Teaching Poetry to Children.

The Nursing Home has some good stuff for people in the context of a Nursing
Home. The place where I will be teaching is a University 'extended learning=
'
program for folks over 50. That don't mean for the incapacitated (tho some
might variously be). It can mean very bright, physically vigorous et al!

Ironically - or not - some institutions are discovering the reading and
making of 'literature' - including poetry -  is just as,or much more alive
for folks letting go of family and career obsessions, in addition to those
in the twenties' bracket. Not that one is better than the other, it's just
as important.=20

Alert! Baby boomer demographics =3D extended and various lit job careers on
the PhD horizon. Retirement - as was such -  is dead! Or the eternity of
adjunct teaching!=20

Thanks all for the front and back channel anthology suggestions.

Catherine,

I wanted to respond to this because I have had any number of interesting discussions about feminism and with feminists over the years and to date I still don't know what to do about it or how to think about it. Part of my problem is that so many highly vocal people who want to call themselves feminist represent feminism as a sort of monolithic thing that's perfectly synchronized to their political point of view and who characterize anyone who disagrees with them as Backlashers or anti-feminists or masculinists. I find it very difficult to talk to such people who live in such a black and white political world. Tangentially that's been a problem with all sorts of identity politics for me, and I think it's just a side effect of the marginalization of political extremes. I think you get the same attitude from reactionary right wing evangelical christians as you do from radical left wing gyno-centric
anarchists. Which is a shame, because to me feminism in part means open discourse and mutual respect of all people. Which is a lot easier to talk about than it is to put in to practice.

So I'm writing this because you seem reasonable and informed and because for the life of me I can't work out in my brain where the hostility in all this comes from. I've me feminists whose idea of radical action was to go to hard core punk rock bands performances, occupy the stage and then stand immobile on the dance floor in order to stop the "macho bullshit" slam dancing going on in order to create a "safe space." At the same time, I've had my mind blown by the theories of radical feminist philosophers like Lynn Hankinson, who is the one professor i had as a philosophy undergrad who i had the distinct impression was a thinker i could never hope to catch up to. I've also met young women in their late teens and early twenties who were so turned off by the brand of feminism that they'd encountered in intro to women studies courses that they had stopped self-identifying as feminists, despite
the fact that they still believed strongly in the values that they once toook to be core ideals of the feminists they once believed they were. I'd very much like to describe myself as a feminist, but am wary about doing so having been told by several different women on different occasions that because of my skin color and the structure of my reproductive organs i have no claim to the term.

What I'm wondering, and I'm sorry this is such a long way of getting to the question, is their room in 21st century feminism for self-criticism? Can a person, like me, who thinks that: the fact our society has not done more to curb the incidence of rape is the greatest shame of our civilization; that men and women should get equal pay for equal work; that the sexist assumptions made by the tax code and social security administration should be gender neutralized; and that access to reproductive health care including birth control and safe, legal abortion is any woman's right and that the state should stay out of the issue altogether, still be a feminist? Even though I disagree with the analyses of culture that invoke such ideas as "patriarchy" and "male oppression" as rhetorically and philosophically unsound? And why isn't there a way for me and people like me to raise those concerns without
being accused of anti-feminism, masculinism, or allegiance to the political ideas of Camille Paglia or Christina Hoff Sommers? Not to run them down, both have their good and bad points, as do all thinkers, but I disagree with both of them much more often than I agree with them.

I guess what I'm asking is why is the discussion of feminism and what feminism means so apparently doomed to vitriol and venom? If we have learned anything from the victories of feminism, it seems to me that one of the most valuable lessons has to be the importance of listening to marginalized voices. I know a great many women who are very much committed to that point. But it seems like whenever a discussion becomes politicized as this one has, that value is one of the first to be sacrificed.

hrm. I'm not sure i've expressed myself clearly at all, but I hope you get the gist, I very much liked what you had to say in the email below.

Poets and fiction writers involved with the Neighborhood Writing Alliance

will perform with The Ways & Means Trio

at Muse Cafe - 8-10 p.m. on Tuesday, October 17

as part of the Lower & Upper Limits series

The Neighborhood Writing Alliance (NWA) provides opportunities for adults to
reflect on, discuss, and write about their personal histories and everyday
experiences. We host weekly writing workshops in Bronzeville, Douglas,
Uptown, West Englewood, East Garfield Park, Hyde Park/Woodlawn, the Near
West Side, and South Lawndale. The Neighborhood Writing Alliance believes
that writing about personal experiences and one's neighborhood-and sharing
those experiences-can lead to increased community involvement. Workshop
participants read and perform their work at public venues throughout
Chicago. Participants are published in our quarterly magazine, the Journal
of Ordinary Thought(JOT), with its motto, Every Person Is a Philosopher.

Lower & Upper Limits is a series at Muse Cafe that explores collaborations
between poets and musicians and relationships between language and music.
The Ways & Means Trio is Jayve Montgomery (reeds, percussion, electronics),
Joel Wanek (upright bass, cello), and Daniel Godston (trumpet, percussion).
The title of this series is taken from Louis Zukofsky's "A-12": "I'll tell
you. / About my poetics -- music / speech / An integral / Lower limit speech
/ Upper limit music." Lower & Upper Limits happens at Muse Cafe on the third
Tuesday of the month. Ways & Means will be performing with Toni Asante
Lightfoot on Tuesday, August 15. The Neighborhood Writing Alliance will be
joining us on October 17.

Muse Cafe is at 817 N. Milwaukee Ave. in Chicago, and the phone number is
312.850.2233. The Chicago station on the CTA blue line is a half a block
away. This event is free and open to the public, donations appreciated. For
more information about the Neighborhood Writing Alliance, please contact
(773) 684-2742 or editors@jot.org, or visit their website at www.jot.org.

Dodie Bellamy will present "Digging Through Kathy Acker's Stuff"

Kathy Acker, the novelist and theorist, died from breast cancer in
1998.  Her papers are at Duke, but her clothes and accessories remain
in the possession of her executor, Matias Viegener.  Last February
while visiting Viegener in Los Angeles, author Dodie Bellamy rummaged
through Acker's extravagant designer wardrobe and wheedled one of her
Gautier dresses, and a couple pieces of jewelry from him.  Possessing
such intimate effects of a woman she was in awe of, Bellamy felt
compelled to write about it. "In Digging Through Kathy Acker's
Stuff," Bellamy meditates upon relics, ghosts, compulsive shopping,
archives, make-up, our drive to mythologize the dead, Acker's own
self-mythologizing, the struggle among followers to define Acker,
bitch fights, and the numina of DNA.  Accompanying her reading will
be images of Acker's clothes.


Donal Mosher will present "October Country"

Donal Mosher's October Country is part of an ongoing record of
Upstate New York.  Shot each Halloween, this record now covers six
years and three generations.  This latest work is based on the ghost
hunting notebooks kept by Denise Brown, Mosher's aunt, as part of her
paranormal investigations.  Though Donal's idea of the ghostly
incorporates the living as well as the dead, these images were shot
according to his aunt's rules for spirit photography.  Many of these
shotswere taken with a disposable camera during and official
investigation of the Middleville cemetery.

What depresses me this morning is receiving a book called Ideas: A
History from Fire to Freud, in which "feminism" (or gender or anything
similar) doesn't even exist in the index. No Mary Wollstonecroft among
the Romantics, no suffragettes among the modernists, etc etc etc. From
a quick scan of this (very ambitious and fascinating-looking book) one
realises that "ideas" are something that only happen to men, and that
feminism, unlike romanticism or secularism or nationalism, is not an
"idea".

It's all very self confirming.

Best

It seems  weird to me that's there's no mention  on
this List, or anywhere else I can find, of the sad
collapse of the anticipated Creeley conference in
Buffalo due to the swift, intense snowstorm of
Thursday evening that snapped  all too many trees and
branches thereof and  knocked out the city's
electricity.

I arrived from NYC by Amtrak on Thursday night at
Exchange Street around 10PM...well let me cut out the
rest of story since the latest version of the Welcome
Message presumably still cautions against the
"diaristic"...but let me make the suggestion, please,
can as many of the papers as possible that were to be
presented be posted somewhere on the Net?

Thanks.

I, too, would appreciate reading the papers.

I drove to the Church Thursday evening anticipating Blaser and Waldrop --
unaware of the weather that was unfolding.  The church dark and
uninformative.  The drive home with lightning, thunder, branches dropping
into the road in front of me -- the snow, the silly snow.

Would I die for poetry?  Not willingly.

I sat in my house with no electricity, no internet, no telephone all weekend
and wondered if everyone else was gathered somewhere, while I . . . but no?

Today I expected to find a trail of emails informing me of what I had missed
but they had somehow found.  But perhaps all of us were silenced by this
storm.

The anticipation
the disappointment
oh

Martha,

I walked from my Niagara Falls Blvd motel to the
Amherst Campus on Sunday (on Saturday I wasn't
knowledgeable of what the route would be--Maple
Avenue) but found at Capen Hall, rather unsuprisingly,
that nothing was going on and there was no further
information.  Then I was really glad that the
intercampus bus to Main Street was running because I
certainly did not want to cross the "bridge" part of
Maple Avenue again--and the reverse of my original
direction looked quite a bit more dangerous.

No and no. Nor Christine de Pisan nor Madame Curie nor Hildegard von
Bingen nor Susan Sontag nor Simone Weil. Not even Sappho. But we do
get Edward Said and Sir Peter Hall (no Ariane Mncouchkine) and
Socrates and Karl Popper. William Wordsworth but no Virginia Woolf or
Gertrude Stein. And so it goes.

Actually, in my adventures in the index I haven't seen _one_ woman. It
doesn't mean that none are there. But it's quite possible.

This book was published in 2005. If feminism changed the world, a
bunch of men are busy changing it right back.

I was in Port Colborne, 18 miles west of Buffalo;
we got hit too, but maybe not as hard.
I had forgotten the Creeley conference.
Is Robin all right?

Stephen requests the following corrections to his second post:

He took his long walk on Saturday -- did not know how to get to the
conference on foot on Friday, and on  Sunday, he was headed back to the
order of New York City.

(I added the last bit.)

He did find some good pizza near the Main Street campus where Just Pizza
remained open and offered tasty pizza throughout the storm.

George, I wanted very much to hear Blaser read -- had looked forward to it
for months.  I hope he and the others were OK, that no one connected with
the conference got stuck on the Thruway for 12 hours or on the tarmac at
Buffalo International Airport for many hours as well.  Unfortunately, this
is not hyperbole.

As for me, I hope that once the organizers have regained their internet
voices that they speak to us --

Martha

Mime-Version: 1.0

 From what I have heard, from several people who were at the Buffalo
Creeley conference, the events went on, sometimes in make-shift
locations, in spite of the storm and its devastation.

Over half the houses and business in the Buffalo region lost their
power -- and many, perhaps as many as 200,000, were still without
power as of early this evening. The schools in Buffalo and the
suburbs are expected to be closed throughout the week. The storm,
coming before the leaves had fallen, caused extensive damage to the
trees, many of which, if not most, lost branches, which crashed into
the power lines and roadways.

On Friday, the UB campus had to be closed due to the weather
conditions, one of the few times the campus has ever been shut down.
(The campus is about 14 miles from downtown Buffalo and on Friday the
city and county declared a state of emergency, banning all but
essential traffic from the roadways.) The airport lost power during
the first day of the storm and was closed Friday.

As I heard the story, the conference participants made the best of
it, commandeering a meeting room in their downtown hotel and carrying
on as best they could. As far I know, Saturday's events took place at
the church, as scheduled, since the church did have electrical power.

The hotel where the conference participants were staying did have
electrical power and there were no problems with the group returning
home safely on Sunday.

It was a great disappointment to me -- and many others -- not to be
able to get to conference. But I think most of the scheduled
speakers/readers were there & continued on as best they could
--  forming a pool of light against a surrounding darkness.

For those who managed to come together on this past woe-beset Buffalo
weekend, I do believe Bob Creeley was celebrated and mourned.

Gwyn,
Bravo, Gwyn, I'm with you. And David BC, with his
customary compassion and common sense. But I admit to
sharing Jason Quackenbush's discomfort with the
charged theoretical rhetoric and its tendancy to
promote exclusivity and unproductive hostility. I like
how you bring it back to the real issues: not
"patriarchy" (although issues of canon, etc certainly
deserve attention) but the real violence and
injustice. So here I am, sitting at my computer, and I
have an earnest question for you: what can I do? I
give to charities (and responsibly -- I find out about
them before giving -- and plan on doing so on a much
more regular basis), I try and live an ideal of
respect and non-violence, I support -- verbally or in
writing -- those whose missions I believe in. But
here's the rub: I'm very skeptical about "traditional"
activism (rallies, pamphlets, posters and the like) as
an effective means of political action, and I'm
looking for some political imagination. Before we get
into another silly flame-war among people who mostly
agree about what's most important, maybe we should
talk about what people think are viable and
efficacious means of political engagement. Including
poetry, why not (although, once again, very
skeptical...). Especially in a country whose
possibilities for "civic involvement" in government is
so tragically, so laughably, so unjustly limited (ie,
voting, jury duty, and citizen initiative legislation
:(  ).
Help me, Gwyn. I'm with you, here.
Yours,
Alex

D-B: Why the moment people begin to speak of conditions in
the United States are they swfitly told horrors are much
worse under Islam?

Eric: Why is it that the moment someone fingers the worst
offenders against any aspect of basic human rights, they are
immediately reminded that the purpose of the discussion is
to excoriate American or Western society? Reflexive
masochism perhaps?

D-B: To tell people to divert their attention and direct it
elsewhere far away where they can have little immediate
effect --let alone only in Islamic countries only--

Eric: Ah, at last, your points: (a) it is a diversion solely
because you feel we can't do anything about it, and (b) to
even mention the worst offenders is to criticize them alone,
and ignore the West.

First, are you incapable of imagining Western feminists
strongly engaging women who live under Islamic Sharia
oppression? Do you really think the majority gender so
powerless to work change where the worst offense is? If it
is a diversion to mention Sharia's crimes against women,
then it was equally a diversion for people in the 1940s to
alert the West to the Nazi's genocidal intent.

Second, to mention the worst offenders in the world is not
to ignore the lesser offenders at home. What would make you
think that? To go back to a historical analogy, it was
precisely the defeat of Nazism (and all the societal
structural changes incumbent to that defeat, i.e., women
workers in defense plants, African-American valor in combat)
that highlighted our own domestic inequalities and set the
stage for their gradual institutional remedy.

1) The view of feminism as "monolithic" is one that many feminists detest, particularly because of the lack of class-consciousness in the kind of feminism of which many anti-feminists construct a caricature to beef up their complaints (which would be, in some ways, just, if they had any idea who their targets were--something they could learn by, say, talking to more women). Feminism is, in fact, probably the LEAST monolithic "ism" around. There are Marxist feminisms, black feminisms, queer feminisms, Islamic feminisms, and on and on, most of them nonexclusive in seeing connections between each others concerns (whereas there's no coherent "feminist Marxism," etc.). Nowhere else does one find a comparable consciousness of the crucial nature of ALL the problems brought up by those who incessantly complain, "your stance can't be worthwhile--it doesn't solve THIS problem." Many feminists see their project as oriented toward the goal of ending all oppression, aware that poverty,
 misogyny, racism, intellectual repression, etc. all support each other. There are countless problems to be solved in countless places; those that are less hard to solve (less resistance) still need to be solved, and so do those that are harder to solve. Luckily, there are a lot of people (not enough) who want to solve them, and some will work on one cluster of problems, some on another; some will primarily consider problems that are geographically far away from them, and some will consider what's closer. This diversity is necessary, and provides, I think, some reason for--if I may be permitted the word--hope.

2) It might be too generous to talk about the "fear" of anti-feminists like the guys who have set off the latest phase of this strand; a smug, self-satisfied dismissal, a jaded, seen-it-all attitude, is one of the most successful available means of flight from fear into acceptance of whatever little bits of socially sanctioned power fall to such a guy. "Change" is probably not an effective word in their vocabulary;
if they're afraid of anything, it's probably ever losing face--and fear of losing face is something everybody needs to get over pretty fucking quickly.

3) Men, like many other social groups, get some power and privilege they may never have asked for. The redistribution of power (or maybe its dissolution) demanded by feminists is going to be uncomfortable for men in some ways. Duh. That doesn't mean that a feminist guy has to be constantly consumed by guilt and shame. But it does mean some work, some reconsideration, some self-critique that doesn't incessantly demand some immediate profit from it. This paragraph is an incomplete thought.

My 2 cents.

  The thing is
  those of us who knew or met "Mr." Bukowski
  could easily dispel most of this claptrap
  appearing on this list

  but what fun would that be--
  with your pet promos pissed into hopelessness

  as who has time to write a few books of poetry
  and a book or two worth of fiction every year
  and be drunk every moment?

  I don't myself, but tommorrow when I have dinner with Amy Tan
  maybe I will find out that she does.
  None of the bunch of award winning folks
  I find myself in truck with lately do--

  So you believe "Mr." B was drunk each day?
  What should I tell you next,
  about what revelations
  Morgan Spurlock told me
  when in Columbus
  making me pizza
  & following my orders?
  Should I further impound revelations
  about Wal mart,
  or Bill Shields
  or Mc Donalds?

  Please--
  you are a bunch of dumb fucks
  who do exactly what the hegemony expects.

  Even you foreigners,like daniel--
  yr the next Canadian Donald Hall
  I know yr writing about birds & beavers & shits right now--
  sucking establishment ass for postition
  & some day Rob will need to compete with you
  because of your oh so "outsider" status

  If it were not for people like Gwen & Joe
  and their opinion
  I would dump this whole list
  right in the pooper
  like a pint of Jack
  after a day at the races--





Be well

Gwyn: if you seriously, for one moment, think that the
issues facing women in *just* the US today . . . are merely
a "mote," then I submit that you are the Kaspar Hauser of
the 21st century and have, until recently, been living in a
cave. Congratulations on your release.


Eric: You're revealing your ignorance of what a 2004 UN
report called "the worst ongoing genocide in history." Never
mind the Sudanese famine caused by the Islamist butcher Omar
al-Bashir, the trafficking in female slaves throughout North
Africa and the Middle East, the execution of rape victims in
Pakistan, Dubai, Sudan and Nigeria; the brutal treatment
brutal of Iranian women who resist mandatory Hijab and
sexual apartheid; the acid attacks in Bangladesh; "dowry
killings" of women; or the abuse of female immigrants by
their own communities -- you, Gwyn, would rather initiate a
personal attack on a stranger than admit global perspective
or sense of context. And you write about "living in a cave"?
Must be chilly in there for you.

Um, no. I'm revealing no such thing. Also, Kaspar Hauser was a
*prisoner,* kept in a basement *against his will,* but if you want to
see that as an attack, you go right ahead.

Yes, US-based feminists know about these ghastly atrocities. Some of us
are even working with international organizations, both open (e.g.
Amnesty International, Médecins sans Frontières) and covert, to help
stop them. But... help me with your logic here, or explain it in terms
of Earth logic. Because horrible things are happening around the globe,
it is bad to be a feminist in the US and to work on issues facing women
in the US... why?

Or, put a bit more bluntly: Does the fact that I haven't actually been
killed, or had acid thrown in my face, following my rape diminish its
atrocity? (Murder and disfigurement happen to women here too, or don't
we get to think about that?) I suffer seizures because of traumatic
brain damage from that attack. Is that insufficiently atrocious for you?
Is it just an ordinary, boring rape because my then-boyfriend, the
perpetrator, failed to murder me afterwards, or wasn't a Muslim? I'm so
sorry not to be dead enough for you, Eric. But I seriously thought this
list was beyond "my atrocity is more atrocious than your atrocity."

Alex Dickow, may Buddhas follow his every step, asks a much more
sensible question: how to help the women around whom he lives, as a
first step toward freeing all women AND all men -- I believe I said that
status-quo gender roles around the world are disabling to the
intelligent participation of men in daily life and the world community,
too. By his own account, he's already doing some of that -- living with
respect for all, and researching, and then giving to, particular
charities. One could help almost any organization meant to serve the
poor, as poverty in the US is disproportionately female right now. My
university's most recent production of Eve Ensler's _The Vagina
Monologues_ was able to present a sizable check to each of two
beneficiaries: a shelter for homeless women with children, and the
county domestic violence services agency. Although, as Alex points out,
the civic system in this country puts the "mental" in "governmental,"
one can put up flyers for, hand out leaflets for, work phone banks for,
vote for, candidates for office who support and respect women in various
ways. Hell, Alex could run for office his ownself. It's beautifully
crazy enough to work. But "think globally, act locally" isn't just a
bumper sticker. It's hard to recruit international relief workers from a
population demoralized by its own poverty, vulnerability to violence,
and general powerlessness.

Thank you for your intelligent and well-thought out posting relating to what I put out yesterday.  Also, thank you for not calling me an anti-feminist since I am nothing of the sort.  I merely suggested that feminism had not yet achieved its larger aims.  One of the operative words here is "yet".  I have no idea whether feminism will ever achieve these aims.  But to call me anti-feminist because I suggested the fact that the whole world has not been changed in the way some changes have occurred here in the developed world is brain-dead and insulting.  Also, what is "broken syntax" anyway?As for this discussion as a whole, my apologies for starting it.  And, although Charles Bukowski, whose work has nothing in common with mine, abused women or said he did in his stories, some of his poetry is quite good.  Enough said, I hope.  But probably not.  Regards, Tom Savage

Mark Weiss <junction@EARTHLINK.NET> wrote:  I started this thread because I was perplexed by the phrase "feminist
in its breaking the syntax," which I thought claimed rather more than

What's unfolded from that is pretty astounding--we've apparently not
arrived at a moment when civil discussion about gender issues is possible.

OK, here's what I think. Modern feminism arrived on the scene in
middle class Europe and America (including, by the way, much of Latin
America) at a propitious historical moment. Within the middle class
the traditional division of labor and the power that goes with it
had become manifestly obsolete by WWII, despite the reaction of the
late 40s and 50s. As a result, massive social change within the
middle class happened, in historic terms, with astonishing speed and
lack of violence. Compare with the empowerment of the middle class
(French Revolution), colonies (US and Latin American Revolutions, and
into the present day), and the ending of slavery (US civil war, for
one). In a bit more than a generation middle class women have come to
be a majority of university students, new PHDs, new LLDs and MDs, and
are quickly approaching at least parity in MBAs. The places that hire
people with those degrees haven't notably lowered their payscales.
And we will likely have a viable woman candidate for president of the
US (to join the women who have been heads of state in make your own
list of countries).

I'm not implying that there were no sacrifices and no struggle, just
that the situation could have been a lot worse with less success in
another place and time. As it remains in other social classes in the
industrialized and post-industrial world, and as it does in much of
Latin America, Africa, and Asia. Simply, feminism has been less
successful in places where the resistance is greater. And the
resistance is greater in places where for many people traditional
divisions of labor are, or at least seem to be, still functional.

So by all means we should do everything in our power to aid in the
empowerment of women wherever they are. But that empowerment will hit
a wall of resistance as long as larger social conditions remain static.

Muhammad Yunus and his Grameen Bank (winners of this year's Nobel
Peace Prize) is a case in point. Most of his microloans have been to
home-based businesses run by women. The women have disproportionally
invested their earnings in schooling for their daughters as well as
their sons, who will become advocates for more of same. The relief
from the most grinding of poverty and the creation of disposable
income, and the increase in education of both men and women, are
likely to have an impact on all of the horrors we all know about. And
it will of course expose more people to feminist ideas. Maybe in 20
or a hundred years we will no longer be able to separate the impact
of feminist political action and thought from this kind of change in
the lives of the poorest. Which would be fine by me--if things
improve the argument will be academic anyway. But I doubt that there
will be much improvement in the lives of women, whether in working
class America or among the destitute in Bangladesh, without the
socioeconomic change I'm talking about.

this is the struggle as i see it--when we focus on making a change, it is
difficult to do it without the tag of class in mind.  for example, many of
the institutionalized opressions facing women in the us tend to be
concentrated on the lower economic classes--ie access to health care, which
necessarily negates any real access to reproductive rights, etc.  i am sure
we can all count thousands of these examples.
it seems to me that we can address the issue from hundreds of vantage
points, but if the lowest common denominator is economic, and if economic
reforms and changes are what will have the greatest effect, we need to at
the very least be working on both fronts.  i think here in the us a group
like planned parenthood is doing some good work to that end.

i don't mean to sound like a bastardly revolutionary, but it is hard for me
to imagine any rich women being oppressed.  (i am not a rich woman, so i
suppose that explains it).

within the subset of working poor/uninsured/underinsured/poverty stricken
rates for all kinds of horrible things jump--murder, crime, infant
mortality, unwanted pregnancy, etc.  it's a self-perpetuating and
reinforcing cycle.

for me, as a novice scholar of feminism, it has been most difficult to
reconcile what i know of feminism and feminist theory with what i see in my
neighboorhood, my family, my life.  i suppose access is the key,
then--access to the same things women with much more money have.

i know i'm rambling.

i never met charles bukowski. He died when I was like fifteen or something. but i do know teddy haggerty, and teddy knew charles bukowski, and based on the stories teddy tells, i get the impression that charles bukowski's reputation for being a violent and belligerent drunk isn't at all undeserved.

that having been said, as a mellow and jabbering drunk, i have to say that there are worse things in the world to be than a violent and belligerent drunk. and also i'd like to point out that being a person with emotional problems does not make someone a bad person. or a bad poet. or a good poet for that matter.

I like bukowskis poetry. He was one of the first 20th century American poets I read whose work really sang for me. this at seventeen after discovering that i didn't understand what ginsberg was talking about and coming to the conclusion that jack kerouac was wildly over rated. there was something in the vernacular and the top heavy weight of his lines that made something click in my brain and all of a sudden i was a poetry junkie. I know there are a lot of people who have had similar experiences with chuck b, and i think that that in itself is a pretty remarkable achievement. so credit where credit is due.

Content-Type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII; delsp=yes; format=flowed

Hi All,

Here's a brief rundown on the Creeley Conference.

First, a note to Martha and others who may have gone to "The
Church."  The event did not take place at "The" Church, i.e. the
church recently rehabbed by Ani DiFranco, where Just Buffalo held the
Creeley birthday celebration in May.  It was held at "a" Church,
specifically Trinity Church, which is about a half a block north of
"The Church" on Delaware avenue. My cell was ringing off the hook
with calls from people who went to the wrong place.

10/12

Robin Blaser and Rosmarie Waldrop read first, a massive thunder and
snowstorm occurring outside. About 75 people attended, the largest
attendance of the event.  Unfortunately, the sound system left a
little to be desired, making it extremely difficult to here either of
the readers.  Rosmarie read some new work and also from Reproduction
of Profiles (newly re-released with the other two parts of the
trilogy).  When Robin first opened his mouth, a massive thunderclap
shook the church.  I don't think anyone, atheist, agnostic or
believer, didn't pause to wonder the source. He read Creeley's "The
Plan is the Body," and then launched into a reading of his own work.
It was very difficult to hear him, as the mic would only pick him up
when his mouth was directly in front of it.  Unfortunately, I
remember the technical difficulties more than I remember the content
of his reading.  Someone else will have to fill in the details. He
seemed quite healthy, even spry, for those who were asking.

Driving home that night around midnight, the destruction wrought by
the storm became apparent as we drove up Richmond Avenue toward our
home in the Black Rock neighborhood of Buffalo (we live about two
blocks from the Creeley's old firehouse) -- trees split right down
the middle, or tipped over on their sides, having pulled their roots
right out of the ground, limbs everywhere forming labyrinths in the
streets, total darkness.  When we arrived at our house, the 150 year
old Chestnut tree out front had lost five limbs, knocking out the
power lines, phone lines and cable lines.  We were awakened several
times during the night by the sound of limbs snapping and falling on
top of houses, cars, and whatever else was in the way. We still have
no power on our side of the street.

10/13

The university closed, and the event would have been cancelled, but
since all of the scholars in attendance were at the same hotel, they
chose to borrow a conference room and to read their papers there.
There was a complete travel ban throughout the region, so there was
no way anyone could get to the university to post a note about the
change of plans.  Also, many of us had lost internet connections and/
or were trapped in our houses (I had to climb over torn power lines,
tie up a cut phone line and remove half a tree just to get the car
out of the garage (which I had to open and close manually). Around
noon, word started to filter out through text messages and cellphone
calls that papers were being read at the hotel. Many of us ignored
the travel ban, hopped in our cars, and headed down to the hotel.

In the morning, Ben Friedlander read his paper, called, "What is
Experience."  Also, Robin and Rosmarie gave brief readings so people
could actually hear them.  I missed all this, so someone else will
need to fill you in.  After lunch, Michael Gizzi gave a presentation
about Creeley and Jazz, juxtaposing readings by Creeley with certain
jazz recordings.  You'll have to ask Michael what the recordings
were, but they perfectly exemplified Creeley's breathline in music.
Having only ever made the comparison myself in the abstract, it was
amazing to listen to them side by side like that and really hear the
rhythms. peter Middleton gave a talk on Creeley's teaching, which
drew partly from his experience as Creeley's student at Buffalo in
the 70's. Rachel Blau du Plessis finished with a paper on re-
gendering in Creeley.  She told a moving anecdote about Creeley that
nearly brought her (and us) to tears, then gave a really strong
reading of gender in Creeley's work.

In the evening, John Ashbery and Susan Howe gave a reading at Trinity
Church.  About 45 people were in attendance.  They had a better mic
and so were able to better be heard.  Susan read a few older pieces
focused on Buffalo, then continued with newer work, which sounded
great. With Ashbery, I was struck for the first time by the rhythmic
complexity of his work.  I have never thought of his work in terms of
its sound before, but this time, perhaps because of the booming echo
of the 150 year old church, the sound struck me more than the
content.  His work is some of the most polyrhythmic work I recall
hearing, with incredibly subtle modulation among the different
patternings of sound.

No thunderclaps this night.

10/14

Papers were given in the morning and the afternoon in the church
chapel at Trinity.  Morning papers by Michael Davidson ("Creeley's
Rage") and Stephen Fredman (on Creeley and the Interview) were both
fantastic.  In the middle of one of them a boombox sitting on the
steps to the altar sudden let out a shriek of feedback, at which
point I felt certain Bob's ghost was hiding behind an arras
somewhere.  Charles' Altieri gave a paper I did not understand,
during which he read several of Creeley's poems out loud, giving the
impression a non-musician blowing on a tuba.  Unfortunately, I had to
go home for a spell to attend to some branches and wires and quickly
deteriorating food, so I missed papers by Peter Quartermain and Alan
Golding. Marjorie Perloff didn't make it, nor did Charles Berntein.

Ann Lauterbach and Rachel BdP (in place of Charles) read in the
evening.  The sound was fine and there were probably 65 or so people
in attendance.  Rachel read one of her long "drafts," a kind of tract
on Adorno's comment on poetry after Auschwitz.  Ann read mostly from
her book Hum, and also some new work, inlcuding something called
"Alice in the Wasteland." Ann is amazing to see read, as she has this
kind mesmerizing, if affected, way of waving her left hand around as
though she were conducting a symphony.

And then everyone went to the Founding Father's Pub to tie on a good
load.

estimado eric yost-

I think you've --willfully or not--misunderstood what I'm writing.  (and  i
may well have not made it sufficiently clear as well . . . ) I am not
excoriating American or Western soceity, what I am saying is that for
example a person in my position, (ie. survival level) the place to start
activism is where I have a direct presence, voice, etc--my community.  Where
I live is very high rate of prostitution, violence against women, teen
pregnancy, homeless women, single mothers below the poverty level, crack
flowing down the streets, alcoholism, roving bands of violent kids aged ten
to 14 attacking people when they feel like it. (Killed a friend of mine two
summers ago.) I'm not excoriating this world or society, I care deeply for
it, I'm part of it.  I'll do anything I can for it.  It's been my home for
several years now.

By diverting attention I mean that this is a tactic often used by (usually
right  wing) talk radio and tv--bring up a problem in the USA such as rape,
violent mistreatment of women, and the host will scream what about Sharia,
Muslim countries?????  Isn't that just like feminists, attacking their own
country and ignoring the far greater evils throughout the Muslim world?
It's a form of distortion in which you place your opponent in the position
of looking anti-American, pro-Muslim (and Nazi in your equation below) and
you feel as though you have exposed feminism as just another anti-American
"ism" to be done away because it doesn't go after what should be its "prime
concern"--what goes on in Muslim countries.  In the current climate of being
at war with Muslim countries, this has a lot of the ring of the "either
you're for us or you're against us" pronunciamentos of G. W. Bush and
Company.

What I hear in your posts isn't a compassion for Muslim women, but rather a
fear and hatred of Muslims--you equate them with Nazis.  Rather than
understand that I mean  to accomplish something constructive in the world
where I can, here in the USA,  that not all of us can begin with work
abroad, your hysteria continually has you focused on this anti-Muslim
agenda.  If I am not part of that, then I must be against it.  Therefore
anti-American, anti-Western, etc.
What do you propose?  Further wars?
There are women's movements and organizations world wide working to end the
practicies you write of, and they have been for some time and they are
slowly making a difference.   In many countries, these practices began even
before Islam came.  It is going to take very hard work to overcome over
thousand years and more of traditions, taboos, "honor"--just as in this
society the same can be said in other ways one sees daily, that it is very
hard work to change behaviours considered as "natural" or as "rights" or
"privileges" to be granted without question.

It sounds like you are not so much concerned with the Sharia as with the
eradication or defeat in some catastrophic manner of Islam, as Nazism was
defeated.
And if Sharia/Islam were defeated, we would all be more liberated at home.
Yet so far the wars against Islamic countries and terrorist organizations
have been the cause given for the attack on civil liberties at home.
And more and more cuts in any form of aid to programs and people at home in
desperate need of bare essentials--a meal, a place to sleep that's safe--
let alone medical care, education, proper nutrition, heating, electric,
water, transporation, day care, counseling, job training, much else--

I suggest you look into all the organizations around the world working to
change the practices you write of.  I think you'll find it far larger than
you may have had any idea.
If you truly do care so much about Sharia, why not contact one of these
organizations and find out what you can do for/with them?

I don't do things out of a theory or because i'm a "good person" --I've
lived the life around me and people helped me when I was at the very bottom
of it.  It may sound corny but you want to give back--and do what you can
for someone else what others did for you.  And the place where one can do
the best is the one one knows that others can't learn about in a course or
training program, the one one lives in, and , in my case, doesnt have the
means to go beyond.
That doesn't mean that I don't care deeply about Sharia or know nothng about
it.  It means simply that I am accepting and working within my limitations.
And I also believe if this country is going to go around the world preaching
its superior way of life, morality, justice, democracy, and all the rest,
then it should practice what it preaches.
Katrina a year ago revealed for a while the tip of the iceberg of an America
left ever more uncared for in large part because of the wars abroad.  How
much have those wars improved life for women in Iraq and Afghanistan? For
women in America?  I can tell you a wonderful effect they are having on the
streets and in the suburbs of America--bonanza time in the heroin tarde, the
most and best heroin ever seen flooding the market, an outbreak of overdoses
among even old addicts, treatment places filling up with young addicts in
truly terrible shape due to the potency of the new stocks--and each crop of
opium poppies bigger than the last.  More addicts--more prostitution, more
abusisive relationships, sexually transmitted diseases, etc etc more
children born with developmental problems, more people living in poverty,
more crime, more probelms for the addicts' families, an endless series of
ripples expanding outwards into society.
Three losing Wars now intersect daily:  the War on Poverty, the War on Drugs
and the War on Terrorism.  "Think globally and act locally" today means very
much that to work in interventions in one's neighborhood and work for
changes at the simplest daily level, is also linked very much with events
happening abroad.
You write that people ignored Nazism from abroad.  Nazism was ignored first
by people at home.
While being aware of things aboard, one needs to be aware of them at home
also, before they happen to one unawares.  Look how much already has
happened to this country in the last five years.  As an Upton Sinclair novel
of the Thirties has it "It Could Happen Here".
"Oh say can you see"--your civil rights shrinking?--

There are a great many woman and people of all countries world wide working
to chamge Sharia.  And there are people working to change things here at
home also.  Both are needed.
Why not give a hand, there's more than enough to do.

hahahahahahaha.

see what's funny about that is that you write "there must be a lot of seven=
teen year olds who like bukowskis poetry" as if to say that bukowski writes=
 at the "level" of seventeen year olds. Which is bashing both me and bukows=
ki because we're at that "level" and that a more mature "level" exists wher=
e one would see through the transparent sham that is bukowski. hoo boy. tha=
t's funny.

but what's even more funny is that we've been going around and around on th=
e list these last few days about feminism and the lack of sexual inequality=
, when this sort of blatant agism goes completely unchecked, and probably w=
ould go unnoticed if I wasn't pointing it out right now. age discrimination=
 is one of the few forms of bigotry that's socially acceptable in our socie=
ty, and I'm tired of how blind people who i think should be more sensitive =
to it often are. What if Mr. Bowering, someone had said in a similarly dism=
issive manner "yes, I'm sure there are lots of black people who like charle=
s bukowski" or "yes, I'm sure there are lots of women who like charles buko=
wski?" Both statements are undoubtedly true, Charles Bukowski is very popul=
ar, and there are lots of PEOPLE who like him. But your singling out a grou=
p as a method of ridiculing him says nothing about him, or about that group=
, it only says something about you, as I think the thought experiment above=
 succinctly demonstrates.

As the snow fell over Buffalo Thursday night Rosemarie Waldrop and Robin
Blaser read their work to the assembled crowd at Trinity Church in
downtown Buffalo. This was the first of three nights of readings and two
full days of talks at "On Words: A Conference on the Life and Work of
Robert Creeley."

For those that were able to attend it was a memorable and wonderful
occasion.

Parks' treasures badly battered

"Psychologically, . . . we've lost a lot of wealth."

By GENE WARNER
News Staff Reporter
10/15/2006

John Hickey/Buffalo News

Frederick Law Olmsted would be devastated.

The jewels of his vision, the stately maples, oaks and ash trees lining
Buffalo's parkways and parks have been clobbered, and recovery might take
generations.

A preliminary estimate has found that roughly 90 percent of the 5,700 trees
in Delaware Park and its three nearby parkways were damaged in the 16-hour
snowstorm that hit Thursday.

A similar percentage was damaged in the system's five other parks -
Riverside, Front, Martin Luther King, Cazenovia and South - Olmsted Parks
officials suspect, although they said they hoped the smaller snowfalls in
South Buffalo left fewer problems.

Just like homeowners across the metro area mourning the loss of their
favorite trees, Olmsted Parks officials are bemoaning the long-term effects
of the storm - except they agonize over thousands of trees.

"Our greatest fear is that this single event may have wrought as much damage
to Buffalo's treasured Olmsted parks and parkway system as the past 100
years of man's intrusion on these parklands," said Johnathan Holifield,
chief executive officer of the Olmsted Parks Conservancy.

"It's that big a deal."

How would Olmsted have responded to the carnage?

"Olmsted would say that this great city is a little poorer on Oct. 14, both
literally and figuratively, than it was on the morning of Oct. 12,"
Holifield said. "Psychologically, in what these trees add to the heart and
soul of this community, we've lost a lot of wealth."

But a preliminary canvass of Delaware Park's trees also produced some fairly
good news.

"I would think 85 to 90 percent of the trees are savable," said Jeff Brett,
the parks' tree-care supervisor. "That's a figure of what will live through
the storm. But some of them, even though they're still standing and living,
may have suffered a large split or structural defect, and they may have to
be taken down."

The Olmsted Parks have a total of 10,889 trees, including about 5,200 in
Delaware Park and another 520 on Lincoln, Chapin and Bidwell parkways.

Following his own tour of Delaware Park, Brett estimated that 90 percent of
all trees there were harmed in some way.

"Everything that still had leaves on them was damaged," he said. "They
weren't built to support the weight of the leaves and the heavy snow load."

The best news came out of Buffalo's parkways. While downed branches with
their green leaves still covered the parkway islands on Lincoln, Chapin and
Bidwell on Saturday, Brett said he believed virtually all of these
smooth-leaf elms were savable.

According to his preliminary estimate, Rumsey Woods, near the Delaware Park
Rose Garden, had the greatest damage. Brett saw more trees uprooted or split
in half, especially when the ground already was soft from the recent wet
weather.

"Any tree that was leaning already, when you add the snow load, that was
just too much for the roots to hold," he said.

During a brief tour of Delaware Park, Holifield spotted a tree off the ring
road with what seemed like minimal damage, with a few split branches some 10
or 15 feet above the ground.

"Look at this one tree," he said. "This is not a 10-minute job. This may be
a four- or five-hour job. And this is a tree with minimal damage. We have
thousands of trees that require attention."

That cleanup may cost hundreds of thousands of dollars, perhaps more than $1
million.

"But that's just the beginning," Holifield added. "Our challenge is to
restore and rehabilitate this wonderful community asset. That's going to
require planning and additional resources."

Elsewhere Saturday, the painstaking job of removing downed trees, limbs and
branches continued, as homeowners assessed their loss.

The number of damaged trees continues to be staggering.

In the Town of Tonawanda alone, the number could exceed 50,000, according to
estimates provided by Cal Champlin, town clerk.

"You go down any street, and you can barely find a house that doesn't have
significant loss of tree limbs, branches or, in some cases, trees
themselves," Champlin said.

After Supervisor Ronald H. Moline met Saturday with National Grid officials,
town officials said they believe 90 percent to 95 percent of their residents
have lost electric power and heat.

"There seemed to be a sense that the Town of Tonawanda was close to ground
zero in terms of the people without power and [with] tree damage," Champlin
said.

One town official said that except for the snow, the town would appear to
have been hit by a hurricane.

Holifield had a different take: "I'm a Midwestern guy. It looks like a
tornado came through, not a snowstorm."

STORM AFTERMATH
Killer storm devastated region's trees

Trees: Tens of thousands of trees damaged

By GENE WARNER,
JAY TOKASZ and JOHN F. BONFATTI
NEWS STAFF REPORTERS
10/14/2006

Charles Lewis/Buffalo News

The region's wooded landscape has been forever changed.
Tens of thousands of trees are down or doomed.

"This is going to be called the Columbus Day massacre, in local tree
parlance," said Buffalo attorney David J. Colligan, a local tree expert.
"The trees are massacred, no question."

Perhaps, though, an even larger number can be saved with careful pruning and
patience, experts say.

Rough estimates pegged the number of lost trees at 10,000 to 15,000 in the
city, and that's just the "street trees" located between the sidewalks and
curbs. That number could be doubled once front-lawn and backyard trees are
added.

Add trees lost in the suburbs, and the total could be almost doubled again.

Some might quibble with those numbers, but it's clear the doomed trees would
fill a small forest.

One official said the downed or doomed trees would fill about a 250-acre
forest - more than two-thirds the size of Delaware Park.

"This is going to change the look and landscape of the city for 20 years,"
said Buffalo Public Works Commissioner Joseph N. Giambra. "Certain
neighborhoods just aren't going to look the same."

The sight of downed trees, snapped limbs and split trunks will forever be
the snapshot of a heavy snowfall that brought down leaf-bearing branches and
trees, especially throughout North Buffalo, Buffalo's West Side, Kenmore,
Snyder, Eggertsville, Clarence and the city's northern suburbs.

If that was the snapshot, the eeriest sound may have been the cracking of
branches and limbs in rapid-fire succession late Thursday night.

"It sounded like firecrackers going off," said Scott Czamara of Westmoreland
Road, Amherst, where tree limbs started coming down at about 10 p.m.
Thursday.

That was followed Friday by the sad sound of chain saws and manual saws
cutting through downed trunks and limbs.

Czamara was cutting a tree that blocked his driveway Friday, using a handsaw
with his friend Tripp Higgins, also a Westmoreland resident.

Westmoreland was passable, but cars had to dodge downed tree limbs. Most of
the side streets that ran into it were not passable, with large tree limbs
blocking the way through.

"I guess," said Higgins, "it's Mother Nature's way of pruning."

In much of Buffalo and its northern suburbs, the scene was remarkably
similar, and the effects were like that of any crippling snowstorm, with
many main streets passable but side streets choked.

In this storm, though, the side streets were blocked not with snow, but with
wood.

Soaring old growth trees in some of the area's wealthiest neighborhoods took
the brunt of the storm.

On High Park Boulevard in Eggertsville, some residents marveled at the
disappearance of the canopy of foliage that had made their street seem like
living in a park.

The next street over, Le Brun Road also was hit hard, as were streets such
as Chapin and Lincoln parkways and Nottingham Terrace in Buffalo's Delaware
District.

"I think our property values just dropped 10 percent," said Frank Robertson,
only half joking about the damage on Argonne Drive, a Kenmore street long
noted for its lovely treescape.

Silver maples seemed particularly susceptible to damage, some residents
noted.

"The tops of these trees are dead, so it doesn't take a lot for them to snap
off," said Frank Killian, a Town of Tonawanda homeowner.

This natural disaster had one odd sight for a snowstorm: Anyone driving on a
main thoroughfare like Elmwood Avenue could look down a side street and see
a combination of snow and green-leaf-bearing branches - on the ground.

"The devastation is just unbelievable in some places," Giambra said. "There
are lots where there are 10 trees, and all of them are destroyed."

Colligan, chairman of the Reforest Buffalo Committee and known as the "tree
man," referred to the "perfect storm" elements of the Columbus Day massacre:
a southwestern wind roaring across Lake Erie toward a community with trees
that still had their foliage.

"It was like a perfect 100-mile-long bowling lane, with the Buffalo trees as
the bowling pins," he said. "It's a devastating event."

COMMENTARY
Storm leaves scars on face of Buffalo

10/15/2006

    By DONN ESMONDE

The dig-out is different this time. It is not like any other time before.
The legacy of this storm will linger like no other.
Buffalo got back on its knees Saturday. Signs of early stage recovery were
everywhere. Traffic lights blinked back on, roads were cleared of tree
limbs, electrical juice surged back into thousands of homes. Joggers
appeared on streets, cars returned to roads, the area staggered back towards
normal. This is what we see after every big storm. We have done this drill
countless times.

This time, in one large way, it is different.

A freak early October storm dropped nearly 2 feet of wet snow Thursday and
Friday. Trees still adorned with leaves caught the weight of it, bore the
load for hours, then snapped under the strain. Cars were crushed, fences
felled, garages obliterated, houses hurt. The city and region were not just
blanketed, but assaulted.

This storm leaves us not just cleanups, but scars. Limbs and branches -
forestry's body parts - litter streets, lawns and sidewalks. Surviving trees
are torn and wounded, some fatally. Anyone visiting today would think we
were hit not by a snowstorm, but by a hurricane.

Limbs cracking in the crux of the storm sounded like bones breaking. It was
the grand old bones of our glorious wealth of old-growth trees, snapped and
maimed. We were helpless to stop it, we could only witness the destruction.
Some even wept at the sight of it.

Nothing like this ever happened before. The infamous Blizzard of '77 did not
deliver this sort of damage. It was as if a giant stomped down every street,
the B-movie "Attack of the 50-Foot Woman" come to life.

Steve Bernstein has spent all of his 52 years in Buffalo, the past 23 in his
house overlooking Bidwell Parkway. It is part of Frederick Law Olmsted's
grand streetscape, a tree-lined strip of nature amidst the urban swirl.
Bernstein piled fallen branches at the curb Saturday afternoon and surveyed
the natural wreckage.

"Bidwell looks like a war zone," said Bernstein. "Things come back to life,
Buffalo has a way of making that happen. But you wonder what it will take to
make it happen this time."

It is unsettling, driving down the damaged streets. There is a sense of
unbalance, the psychological equivalent of walking on ice. Snow comes and
goes. The twisted wreckage of maimed trees makes it seem like we were
attacked. The natural order of things was violated. This storm did not just
inconvenience us for a few days. It ripped the fabric of the region.

Bernstein remembers the Blizzard of '77. "You had cars buried [under snow],
you had damage from plows, but nothing like this," he said. "This damage you
can't just plow away."

Over the next few days, power will come back, curbsides will be cleared of
tons of downed foliage, folks will return to work, school buses again will
roll. But evidence of the Freaky Friday the 13th storm will remain in broken
limbs and scarred trunks.

"The whole landscape will change now," said John Manyon of Buffalo. "All of
these beautiful trees, damaged. It's an eerie feeling, just looking at it."

A visitor from Manhattan grasped the sense of unreality. Julie Sexany, 35,
was jogging Saturday on Elmwood Avenue.

"There is something not normal about it, all these branches with green
leaves lying in the snow," she said. "There is a sense that things have gone
against nature. And now so many of these beautiful trees will be dying."

There will be other storms, storms that bring more wind or drop more snow.
They will batter us and leave us weary. They will not, like this storm,
break our limbs. They will not, like this storm, rip a piece of our hearts.

Re: CREELEY IN DARKNESS AND LIGHT

As coordinator of this Conference I want to reassure all of you as to the true account of what
happened will be posted shortly when I have the time to do so.  Electricity was only restored
to my home on Monday and my life is a Benjaminian scenario of gathering the shards of what
were previous unities.  Suffice to say that Charles Bernstein's response does not convey an in
situ account of these memorable three days.  A full account will follow shortly.

> Subject: Creeley Conference
>
> Hi All,
>
> Here's a brief rundown on the Creeley Conference.
>
> First, a note to Martha and others who may have gone to "The
> Church."  The event did not take place at "The" Church, i.e. the
> church recently rehabbed by Ani DiFranco, where Just Buffalo held the
>
> Creeley birthday celebration in May.  It was held at "a" Church,
> specifically Trinity Church, which is about a half a block north of
>
> "The Church" on Delaware avenue. My cell was ringing off the hook
> with calls from people who went to the wrong place.
>
> 10/12
>
> Robin Blaser and Rosmarie Waldrop read first, a massive thunder and
>
> snowstorm occurring outside. About 75 people attended, the largest
> attendance of the event.  Unfortunately, the sound system left a
> little to be desired, making it extremely difficult to here either of
>
> the readers.  Rosmarie read some new work and also from Reproduction
>
> of Profiles (newly re-released with the other two parts of the
> trilogy).  When Robin first opened his mouth, a massive thunderclap
>
> shook the church.  I don't think anyone, atheist, agnostic or
> believer, didn't pause to wonder the source. He read Creeley's "The
>
> Plan is the Body," and then launched into a reading of his own work.
>
> It was very difficult to hear him, as the mic would only pick him up
>
> when his mouth was directly in front of it.  Unfortunately, I
> remember the technical difficulties more than I remember the content
>
> of his reading.  Someone else will have to fill in the details. He
> seemed quite healthy, even spry, for those who were asking.
>
> Driving home that night around midnight, the destruction wrought by
>
> the storm became apparent as we drove up Richmond Avenue toward our
>
> home in the Black Rock neighborhood of Buffalo (we live about two
> blocks from the Creeley's old firehouse) -- trees split right down

>

>

>
> old Chestnut tree out front had lost five limbs, knocking out the

>
> times during the night by the sound of limbs snapping and falling on
>
> top of houses, cars, and whatever else was in the way. We still have
>
> no power on our side of the street.
>
> 10/13
>
> The university closed, and the event would have been cancelled, but
>
> since all of the scholars in attendance were at the same hotel, they
>
> chose to borrow a conference room and to read their papers there.
> There was a complete travel ban throughout the region, so there was
>

>

>

>
> In the morning, Ben Friedlander read his paper, called, "What is
> Experience."  Also, Robin and Rosmarie gave brief readings so people
>
> could actually hear them.  I missed all this, so someone else will
> need to fill you in.  After lunch, Michael Gizzi gave a presentation
>
> about Creeley and Jazz, juxtaposing readings by Creeley with certain
>

> were, but they perfectly exemplified Creeley's breathline in music.
>
> Having only ever made the comparison myself in the abstract, it was
>

>

> gendering in Creeley.  She told a moving anecdote about Creeley that
>
> nearly brought her (and us) to tears, then gave a really strong
> reading of gender in Creeley's work.
>
> In the evening, John Ashbery and Susan Howe gave a reading at Trinity
>
> Church.  About 45 people were in attendance.  They had a better mic
>

Maybe there's an alternative to trying to outdo each other
in self-righteousness? Somebody'll have to start first and
it may not be me.

When D-B writes, "What I hear in your posts isn't a
compassion for Muslim women, but rather a fear and hatred of
Muslims--you equate them with Nazis.  . . . .your hysteria
continually has you focused on this anti-Muslim agenda," I
can't even spot a shadow of my views.

"Hysteria" is probably a bad thing that people who disagree
with D-B often display, but as an actual word denoting
mental agitation or excessive fear, it's out of place.

First, there's the elementary difference between Islamism
and the Islamic faith. D-B is conflating the two, and that
doesn't make for a clear discussion. Islamism is an
aggressive, murderous, fascist, empire-building belief
system, derived from the writings of Sayed Qutb. Islam is
the traditional monotheistic religion. (Islamism is to Islam
what bombing abortion clinics is to Christianity. Granted,
bombing abortion clinics is not as quantitatively murderous
an enterprise as those undertaken by Islamists, but the
comparison does make the point.) Islam cannot be compared to
Nazism; Islamism however can be compared to Nazism.

To repeat an earlier post, highlighting the worst offenders
against basic human rights does not distract from the
problems of our own society. If D-B wants to characterize me
as a Republican, he is mistaken. Maybe he is used to
arguments that vet circular partisan talking-points, and
imagining me a partisan, creates a construct that he can
argue against. You've got the wrong guy for that. I agree
with everything D-B says about our domestic situation. The
USA needs all the help it can get.

D-B: Why not give a hand, there's more than enough to do.

And what makes you think I don't already give a hand? That
was patronizing, David, but I think you may have intended
that as a general rhetorical appeal rather than a specific
proposal for me.

It's surprising that so many people would jump on me for
pointing out the capacious elephant in the room. Maybe too
many people have been narcotized by Spivak's one-pony show.
Or maybe some other animals are involved, like Wild Bill
Blake's "A dog starv'd at his Master's Gate / Predicts the
ruin of the State."


Christopher wrote, "nybody who points fingers at the
(actually very diverse) 'Muslim world' should ponder very
carefully the recent killings by a gunman of 10 young Amish
girls (deliberately targeted) in Nickel Mine, Pennsylvania
and think about what this says of the hideous misogyny
raging in our very own 'democratic and enlightened' society."

Actually it's Nickel Mines, Pennsylvania. I grew up not too
far from there. Not much hideous misogyny raging there, but
what with the limits of attention span, I could be wrong.

However, there is no valid comparison between the
psychopathic rampage at the Amish schoolhouse and
institutionalized murder. (Consider the notorious incident
in Mecca, where members of the Commission for the Promotion
of Virtue pushed fleeing students back into a burning school
because they weren't wearing abayas. Fifteen girls died
there.) To ignore the difference between an individual
psychopathy and a socially legitimized psychopathy is fuzzy
thinking.

Yet Christopher is dead right to suggest RAWA, an example
of committed Islamic intellectual feminists working to
change their societies. In the post that fingered me for
attacks here, I suggested that Western feminists could
actively  engage groups like RAWA in the interest of making
a better world. By the way, RAWA writers insist that the US
ousting of the Taliban has only replaced one brutal
patriarchy with  another, and rectifying this gross error in
US policy could also be a touchstone for feminist
commitment. They are soliciting our support:


http://www.rawa.org/rawa.html
Whenever fundamentalists exist as a military and political
force in our injured land, the problem of Afghanistan will
not be solved. Today RAWA's mission for women's rights is
far from over and we have to work hard for establishment of
an independent, free, democratic and secular Afghanistan. We
need the solidarity and support of all people around the world.

It fascinates me that most of the women who have posted on this thread =
post
in all lower case, because I don't understand it.  I have asked a number =
of
lower-casers about this, and it seems a mix of desire to make writing =
about
poetry as well as writing poetry more intimate and informal, sheer =
laziness
about hitting the shift key (my parrot literally chewed mine on my =
laptop,
so I know -- I have to hit it extra hard), and, of course, a desire to =
not
write in Standard English (a la bell hooks, or perhaps Audre Lord's =
"you'll
not win using men's tools").  It reads to me like low self-esteem.=20

What is "broken syntax."  Well, everybody knows it is programming jargon =
for
incorrect syntax sorta.  There, if the format (not form) includes =
syntactic
conventions, and you've not followed them, the stupid machine's not =
going to
be able to do anything with your stuff.  But, it goes without saying =
(and
has been mostly unsaid here) that as an order, syntax is, well, an =
order.
There are lots of very good reasons to break and reconstruct, just smash =
up,
subvert and pervert, blah blah, any order.  And language order, well, we =
are
poets. L=3DA=3D blah blah.  Those are letters.  Anyway.  Beyond that, =
there is
the question -- is syntax gendered?  And if so, is male syntax, or =
Standard
English, patriarchal?  On the word level, even the OED says that certain
words are "syntactically male" for example, when to refer to non-males, =
a
prefix or suffix must be appended.=20

Hysteria.  Chris Stroffolino has suggested including these posts in my =
poem.
I have thought about including the correspondence around the poem, but =
am
only including the research of the text and sources.  It is a poem which
consists of all the versions of the poem, so the pre-writing or writing
around could logically be included.  Hysteria is psycho-sexual, as is =
most
of the resistance to feminism.  While it is a word that got applied to a
certain set of behaviors a long while back, I would suggest that =
hysteria is
now called IBS (there are a couple of other dis-eases and syndromes, but
this is the biggie).  You know, the whole "tummy" thing.  The meaning of =
the
word has wandered from merely "uterus"?  Hysteria is a word applied
dismissively, generally to women; its definition constantly changes, and
there is no treatment or cure.  It is also the title of a Def Leppard =
album.
Armageddon it?

All best,

This makes me wonder where hysterical veered off its original
definition-path to mean "wildly funny." (My own on-the-spot
definition.) No hell for humor.

We must keep trudging On Through the Night in our quest to understand
our own use of language. Until then, and perhaps even then, we'll
simply be High and Dry.

Three things.

1. Certain words are "patriarchal," to use a contested term, as are
the indefinite pronouns he, his to mean one, one's. That doesn't mean
that standard syntax is gendered. Though I rather like the idea that
when I break syntax I'm in linguistic drag, I don't think it's true.

2. There are many feminisms. Is resistance to any one of them, but
not to all of them, "psycho-sexual"? How about to an aspect of any
one of them? Is it equally so in men and women?

3. Hysteria, as I understand it, to the extent that the term is used
clinically at all (there was a recent article in the Times, I think,
about a revival among a few clinicians), has lost its gender
identification. In my dialect the more casual uses of the term have
long since lost gender, as well as the sense of unexplained
disability. Men and women can behave hysterically (i.e.,
over-the-top, out of control), and male, female and neutral things
can be hysterically funny and reduce one to hysterics. I suspect that
this is true in other dialects.

Yes, so the desire to break the syntax is the desire to make sure
that the program doesn't run; that the brains that process the syntax
are not able to do anything with your stuff. As I said. The goal of
breaking the syntax is the goal of breaking the language so that the
language program doesn't run in human brains. That's contemporary
poetry for you. Nice.

How about a list of those reasons that are "good to break" any order?

As I said before, the notion of breaking something without having
something to replace it doesn't seem to be the very smartest thing --
particularly considering the potential problems breaking the syntax
would have if it were really broken.

So, again, what does "breaking the syntax" really mean?

Re hysteria:  I can't think of a better place to explore the latter
than the following, which blew my mind when I first came across the
article that preceded the book (which article appeared, in all
places, in the IEEE Technology and Society mag!):

The Technology of Orgasm: "Hysteria," the Vibrator, and Women's
Sexual Satisfaction
by Rachel T. Maines (new ed. Johns Hopkins UP, 2001)

If you think you've heard everything re hysteria, think again.

I understand that, in the spirit of our latter-day Minutemen, Mister
Bales has been burnishing his "English-only credentials" to a fare-
thee-well.  For him, it seems, syntax is English, just as contemporary
poetry is written only in English.  Who the hell cares about those
furriners anyway who probably have been breaking syntax for a while
(all the more reason to expel them from our well-policed po-borders)?
You know, French guys (oops, I used the F word in the presence of a
red-blooded Murican) like Stephane Mallarme, 17th century Spaniards
(hell, they're almost like A-rabs, aren't they, so who cares) like
Gongora and Mexicans like Sor Juana Ines de la Cruz (a woman, and you
know these feminists, they hate men and syntax almost in that order)
and neo-baroque writers like Jose Lezama Lima (but wasn't he from Cuba
and aren't they all Commies there out to subvert everything we hold
most dear, like syntax?).  Or the Japanese (we beat their asses in
WWII, so later for them).  Or Caribbean poets like Louise Bennett and
Kamau Brathwaite.  Or dub poets in general.  Or Nuyorican poets.  Or
African-American experimental poets.  Or visual poets.  Hell with them
anyway.  It was all downhill after Philip Freneau.

It's true.  The barbarians have stormed Mister Bales's barbed-wire
fence quite some time ago, but armed with his lethal syntax, he's
ready to make a last stand, Custer-style (by the way, no telling what
those Indians might have perpetrated on our holy syntax without having
anything to replace it with).  He's going to make damn sure that the
unwashed, syntactically-challenged mob read and take as a model genres
like cowboy poetry, which has absolutely no syntactical issues at all,
is comprehensible to the generality (you know, regular folks, at least
Mister Bales's type of regular folks), and rhymes even!

Ah, monolingualism.  What crimes -- and how many poetry listserves --
are committed in thy name.

Marcus, seriously, natural language is not equivalent to machine language so your analogy doesn't hold up. Human brains, being very good at language processing in particular and at parsing and assigning meaning to signs in general, have no trouble "running" a program that doesn't strictly adhere to rules of grammar. More importantly, it's far from settled among the linguists who study such things just what syntax is, and among the literature you will find many writers saying things like some sentence p is well-formed in such and such a dialect, and not well-formed in another. What well-formed means is determined solely by the intuitions of native speakers and any attempt to formalize syntax begins by trying to capture all of the well-formed sentences in a dialect while excluding those that are not well-formed. This is a difficult task and again, there is disagreement among linguists as to what is the best and most naturalistic way of going about doing it.

To that end, the idea that syntax can be "broken" at all is just a sort of shorthand for using sentences that are not well-formed as a poetic device. As such, what determines how well it is done are the same criteria for how well the any device is deployed. It can be done well, like how i do it, or it can be done poorly, as Joseph Massey does occasionally. So to answer your long running question, for me at least, as a writer who finds a lot of room for creativity in working with sentences that are not well-formed, what "breaking the syntax" can mean is anything from mixing dialects to creating ambiguities of meaning by denying a specificity to a subject or object within a sentence, to various paratactical structures, to intentionally creating nonsense poetry (jabberwocky for ie) that forces a reader to focus on the sounds of words rather than their grammatical function, to creating sentences
where homonyms with different grammatical functions can coexist at the same point in a sentence and thereby take on a bivalence not generally available in well-formed sentences. All of these things and more are possible when a writer is not handcuffed to the syntactical rules of Standard English and is willing to explore what meanings can occur if those rules are ignored, or replaced by other rules. which is another way of breaking syntax, simply making up a sentence structure that did not exist previously. People are good at finding the meaning in such things, and it simply requires a certain amount of open mindedness for a person to understand such devices, particularly when they are employed with skill.+

 [for those of you having a bad day, or a stressful day, i'll understand if
you skip the below -- in undergrad we sometimes would meet at midnight
outside the library for a primal scream, so there it is, and for the record
i only pick fights with people i respect]


 -- i appreciate the gains of feminism, but in my limited experience as a
young poet i tend to distrust professional sympathy -- apart from the fact
that there are some feminists i would cut off my right arm to talk to -- BUT
i tend to distrust professional sympathy, because the poetry machine seems
to be about box-trapping young poets and slapping labels on them so they'll
behave -- like rats in a maze -- you know, they'll say, you're a feminist so
how does your poetry align with feminism -- well, who said that was even the
right question -- doesn't matter, we've set it up so that those will be the
questions asked -- so that the community will function predictably -- and so
that, if you ask me, the possibility of asking different questions or
thinking about things apart from all the little box traps -- and
womanization or whatever is a box trap too -- feminist masculinist genderist
patriarchalist -- doesn't matter -- and what you get is box trap poetry --
follower of xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx -- ex-follower of xxxxxxxxxx, since we get
predictability that way -- well last i heard when a poet sits down they
really can write anything they damn well please, even if there are whatever
controls to try to make sure they don't -- and in this boxy environment and
i'm sure feminism isn't the last box trap out there for young women poets --
all the box traps make free inquiry less likely, or less intrusive, which in
a way is the same thing -- keeps the powers that be, the powers that be,
that way -- i think if the poets in charge, whoever they are, can't handle
willfullness and bad behavior and what have you then they're in the wrong
business -- can you believe an art that tells its young generation 'do what
you're told?' do what you're fucking told -- pay us money for tuition and
sit still in class for awhile now -- this IS NOT the young poets' problem at
all !!!!!!!!! -- don't tell me what camp my poetry belongs in, if you wait,
i will tell you -- i won't probably know for 5 years or even more and so
don't fix it for me i'm gonna do it myself -- and don't tell me that knowing
what was in my parents checking account determines the path of my career --
and that the fucking limits everyone is so eager to fence around everyone
else are actually benefitting our art -- what if these fences are robbing it
blind -- and if indeterminacy is so offensive to people i wonder what kind
of business everyone thinks they're in --

-- i would be the last person to slap labels on other poets work in order to

dear eric:

Oh--I'll gladly award and present you with the crown of self-righteousness.
It's all yours!  And decorated, too!

(email can't show i am saying this in a friendly tone)

Thank you for making the distinctions you have among Islam and Islamism.

By the word hysteria I meant its definition as mass hysteria--since I had
brought up talk radio and tv hosts what I was talking about is the form of
mass hysteria these intend/hope to provoke.  (And at times, do.  It's also
the aim of a lot of propaganda--and often wittingly or not of the "news".)
Mass hysteria:  "mass public near-reactions . . .
Hysteria is often associated with movements like the Salem Witch Trials, Mc
Carthyism the Red Scare, Terrorism and Satanic ritual abuse, where it is
better understood through the related sociological term of moral panic."

It is this last definition of Wikipedia's that I had in mind and hoped would
have been suggested by the context.  Since I do a lot of reading about mass
hysteria and those who attempt to incite it by various means, that is the
meaning of it I carry with me in thinking on this subject.  I associate it
with a tone of voice, word choice, and yes syntax often, and the choice of
targets within the climate of the time period and within the community in
which it is being addressed.  (Adorno wrote some very good essays on this
regarding the Nazis' use of radio.)
Sometimes as persons come to words from various disciplines where they have
different meanings and connotations, unfortunately unnecessary confusions do
arise.  The one I have used for so long is this one yet obviously others
know mainly only the other definition, which I know also, yet thought others
would know the one I referred to as well,  hence this misapprehension.
Something to try to recall for future reference perhaps to make clear when
using a technical word is in which discipline's context one is using it.
(the chemical use of "sublime" or the Romantic sublime for example--)

So, forgive the confusion it has caused for people who saw the word at the
expense of the context--I should have made this clearer.

I was having a very  excited conversation in French this morning with one of
my favorite writers, Roberto Bolano--never mind that he died three years
ago--because I had suddenly some good short story ideas from this
discussion.  Some things cropped up I thought he'd appreciate as a bit up
his alley.  I think we are on to something.

Sometimes writing email one feels as though essaying to type while in a
strait jacket, to find the keys while blindfolded.  By the time a mangled
text manages to make it to a screen and through cyber space, it has already
begun to assume a ceratin deformity.  Upon its reception, further
deformities take place.  From the start so many screening and self/censoring
processes are involved--it reminds me of the kilometer long tube you used to
have to put your pass port etc in to be sent forward to the guards and
polizei etc at the entrance to Berlin, by the Wall.  Are you really you?
(In Poland where I went next  they decided I wasn't--until a military
tribunal cleared things up some weeks later.)  You said this--here--what
does this mean?  No, this is not right.  Etc.

I thought of it because reading your idea of me I couldn't help  burst out
laughing.  It's about the exact opposite of who I am as could be.
Which means that I didn't do a good enough job of writing and perhpas you
didn't do a good enough one of reading.
But I'll just stick to my part.

Back to the drawing board so to speak.

I think there is another elephant in the room, but this is between Roberto
Bolano and I.

Speaking of elephants the mother of my oldest son just wrote from
Thailand--they just moved overlooking the Mekong River--and were eating
dinner outside--an elephant came up and serenaded them playing the
harmonica!

I shall apply myself to the study of the posts of those who just posted for
example and many others in order to understand the exact nature of
communication for the correct presentation  of les mots et les choses.

And as a gesture of good will in the style of m. l'elephant--a little song
on the harmonica--a jazz for New Orleans--
since it is music--no words--hopefully the conveyance of an atmosphere of
good will may be felt by all--

To a fare-thee-well, really! Where do you get these? What original
language use! Golly!

But nowhere do I say anything about "English only" -- English is the
language of this listserv and of the poems and phrases and such that
have been offered and discussed.

Breaking syntax, irrespective of language, is making that language
incomprehensible. The phrase is taken, as someone has already pointed
out, from computer programming, where when the syntax is broken the
program, and the machine, won't run. To take that metaphorically into
the language in general, breaking the syntax in any language is to
ensure that the brains (machines) can't understand (run) the poem
(program). It doesn't matter what language you're talking about, if
you break its syntax, you make it incomprehensible. That's the
metaphor.

You don't like it? Make another metaphor.

Well, I could have said "hasta mas no poder" instead of "fare-thee-
well."  But I thought, in deference to the reigning monolingualism,
that I would add a slight archaizing touch.  It seemed somehow, you
know, comme il faut.

Gongora, Sor Juana, Mallarme, Lezama Lima -- yes, they take some work
to figure out (if all one reads poetry for is to "figure it out")
because of their syntactical experiments.  They aren't plain-spoken.
They're "artificial."  They warp the programming and short-circuit the
machine, even before notions of "programming" came into existence.
Think of Huidobro in the early years of the 20th century: "All the
languages are dead."  Sound poetry, scat singing, lettrism -- there
are more things in language and poems, Marcus, than are dreamt of in
your linguistic orreries.

From out of nowhere, Fulcrum has in only a few years established itself a=
s a must-read journal, a unique annual of literary and intellectual subst=
ance positioned on the cutting edge of culture.
   --Billy Collins

A proper poetry journal should be run by proper poets, not by "well-inten=
tioned" committees or genteel "lovers of poetry" along the lines of who's=
 admitted to the social register and who is not. Nikolayev and Kapovich a=
re smart, curious and up to the job. Keep your eye on Fulcrum.
   --August Kleinzahler

Fulcrum is quite simply the most exciting literary magazine I know of--it=
's got the largest scope of any journal, and room for the most depth. In =
an age of jaded readers, Fulcrum gives joyous illumination. Each issue is=
 a treasure.
   --Don Share, Poetry Editor, Harvard Review, and Curator,
            G. E. Woodberry Poetry Room, Harvard University

One of the liveliest, most challenging poetry journals now on the market,=
 Fulcrum is notable for its non-sectarianism, its free-wheeling, wide-ran=
ging presentation of different poetries, candid interviews, and unusual c=
ritical prose.
   --Marjorie Perloff

The reach and variety of Fulcrum is very welcome: from fresh new voices t=
o old and valued ones, with no leaning towards a particular school or cli=
que. Every issue is ample, vigorous and eclectic. No wonder people are ta=
king notice.
   --John Tranter

Fulcrum... where intelligence refuses to die.
   --Charles Bernstein

Poetry in the UK and the US is notorious for its vendettas, closed commun=
ities and border disputes. In contrast, Fulcrum displays an exemplary hos=
pitality to a wide range of poetry and practices. It reminds us why and h=
ow poetry can matter by opening a literal and conceptual space in which a=
ttention can rest on language being brought into activation. Fulcrum is t=
he future.
   --David Kennedy

A poetry journal open to a wider range of philosophical interests than an=
y other, Fulcrum is doing as much to advance philosophy as it is to advan=
ce poetry.
   --Peter Hare, Editor, Transactions of the C. S. Peirce Society:
               A Quarterly Journal in American Philosophy

Fulcrum... is a stroke of luck for us readers, for it offers an unprecede=
nted project in American letters today.
   --Ilya Kaminsky in Jacket

Prepare to be surprised. Literature should be surprising, and in Fulcrum,=
 it is.
   --Rosanna Warren

By its capacious, non-ideological, yet uniquely informed perspective on A=
merican and international poetry, Fulcrum performs an essential role amon=
g the literary magazines of our time. It is packed with the news, both go=
od and bad, that poetry has to offer. Revelations abound in each issue.
   --Michael Palmer

Fulcrum is a state of flux--takes risks, open doors, and doesn't try to f=
ix poetry to any one set of ideas. Challenging nationalist agendas, its i=
nternationalism is never strained. It is a space without fences--and that=
 is to be respected and celebrated.
   --John Kinsella

Returning to Calcutta, I carried Fulcrum with me on the flight: a poetry =
journal from America. Half of this issue [#4] was devoted to anthologisin=
g Indian poetry in English, and I was reading this section... with deep p=
leasure. What interested me was that a different idea of cross-cultural c=
ontact was at work in the journal from the one we're indoctrinated with t=
oday, to do with globalisation and diaspora... Internationalism became si=
gnificant because it brought different literatures together, and addresse=
d, in a new way, the primacy of literature... Reading the anthology, I be=
came aware of what should be obvious: some of the best writing in English=
 in India is being done by poets.
   --Amit Chaudhuri in The Times of India

The Poetry Foundation awarded Mr. [Landis] Everson its newly created priz=
e... the Emily Dickinson First Book Award... with publication of his book=
 underwritten by the Foundation... [Everson] said, "I was waiting to die,=
 very patiently, very agreeably, when the phone rang." It was [Fulcrum's =
contributing editor] Ben Mazer, a poet and editor writing an essay on the=
 Berkeley Renaissance for the poetry annual, Fulcrum. Mr. Mazer had trace=
d Mr. Everson and asked if he had any unpublished poems. He did, and Mr. =
Mazer published them in Fulcrum. With Mr. Mazer's encouragement, Mr. Ever=
son began writing again... Unbeknownst to Mr. Everson, Mr. Mazer submitte=
d his poems for the Poetry Foundation prize. He won, and Mr. Mazer will e=
dit the book to be published by Graywolf Press.
   --The New York Times (October 17, 2005)

A truly international annual of diverse poetry and cogent aesthetic enqui=
ry, Fulcrum is an essential component of every contemporary English langu=
age poet's working library. If your vertical bookshelves are already cram=
med and bulging, let Fulcrum take a well-deserved place on the top of you=
r horizontal stack. It's a distinctive and indispensable publication.
   --Pam Brown, associate editor, Jacket magazine

Actually, what you need to do is to get the latest Fulcrum.
   --Joe Green

I lack the qualifications to review Fulcrum 3 properly, but the more I th=
ink about its density and mass, the more I realize, oh give up trying to =
be Solomon, evaluating Fulcrum 3 is like--trying to hold a moonbeam with =
your hand. A big heavy 500 page behemoth of a moonbeam.
   --Kevin Killian in Jacket

At once international and local in its scope, broadly informed, philosoph=
ic and lyric, Fulcrum is capable of serious lifting!
   --Peter Gizzi

Luckily, Fulcrum comes out only once a year, otherwise there wouldn't be =
much time left to do anything else.
   --S. K. Kelen

Fulcrum is an elegant little poetry magazine published from "a room in Bo=
ston," already seen as one of the most significant of its kind.
   --The Hindu

I'd say it blows away just about any print poetry publication out there. =
 ...It merits comparisons to John Tranter's Jacket and outdoes Jacket in =
some significant ways (fortunately it isn't a competition...).  Fulcrum i=
s no mere experiment but instead the polished delivery of a swirl of so m=
any influences...
   --Patrick Herron on the Buffalo Poetics list

Russian expats Katia Kapovich and Philip Nikolayev have launched in the U=
S a poetry annual called Fulcrum. These two =C3=A9migr=C3=A9s have succee=
ded at the kind of project that has of late proven to be beyond the power=
 of American and British lovers of literature, who are well grounded in W=
estern culture, at home in its institutions, educated at prestigious univ=
ersities, well-connected in literary circles, and skilled at dealing with=
 foundations that support cultural initiatives.
   --Inostrannaia Literatura ("Foreign Literature," Moscow)

...Katia Kapovich, che con il marito Philip Nikolayev sta emergendo sulla=
 scena americana grazie alla rivista Fulcrum di cui sono editori.
   --Alto Adige: Cultura & Societ=C3=A0

Why does poetry have the power to lift us, enlighten us, and, yes, comfor=
t us? I mulled over this question with Katia Kapovich and Philip Nikolaye=
v. Poets originally from the former Soviet Union, they now live in Cambri=
dge and edit Fulcrum, a journal of English language poetry from around th=
e world.
   --The Boston Globe

[Fulcrum] will fill days in your life in a most gratifying way.
   --www.FieraLingue.it

Fulcrum... arose a well-connected giant out of nowhere.
   --Foetry.com

Fulcrum is probably the best poetry magazine currently available in the U=
S.

THE GRAND PIANO
An Experiment in Collective Autobiography
San Francisco, 1975-1980

by Bob Perelman, Barrett Watten, Steve Benson, Carla
Harryman, Tom Mandel, Ron Silliman, Kit Robinson,
Lyn Hejinian, Rae Armantrout, and Ted Pearson

THE GRAND PIANO is an on-going experiment in collective autobiography by
ten writers identified with Language Poetry in San Francisco. It takes its
name from a coffeehouse at 1607 Haight Street, where from 1976-79 the
authors took part in a reading and performance series. The writing project
was undertaken as an online collaboration, first via an interactive web
site and later through a listserv. When completed, THE GRAND PIANO will
comprise ten parts, in each of which the ten authors will appear in a
difference sequence.

"Like the early avant-gardes, the people who gathered at the Grand Piano
developed not only an exacting and liberating poetics, but also a way of
living-in-art. Its chronicle here is many things, among them a deeply human
and amusing map to building community through literature in this most
unlikely of times. --Cole Swenson

Part 1 is scheduled to appear November 2006, with subsequent volumes to be
published at three-month intervals. Subscription to the entire series of
ten volumes is now available for $90 (individual volumes for $12.95 each)
directly from Lyn Hejinian, 2639 Russell Street, Berkeley, CA 94705. For
subscription order form:

CREELEY IN DARKNESS AND IN LIGHT


I think Mike Kelleher touched on most of the major points in his generously detailed posting.
But, by way of addition (or maybe repetition), I want to mention that only the Friday campus
events were effected.  Mercifully the two downtown venues remained fully functioning and
events went on according to schedule with only two participants absent (Charles Bernstein
and Marjorie Perloff).  One ironic phenomenon was the intense camaraderie and
improvisatory determination to make this important event happen and happen it did.  My
thanks to Charles for his posting from the outsider position and I merely want to clarify that
the Conference was neither a festschrift, a celebration, nor a mourning. The “mourning”
occurred here in Buffalo in UB’s Poetry Collection a few days after Bob’s death when I called
an impromptu and informal gathering of local friends and colleagues; 284 people turned up
for that including Penelope Creeley, and her children Wil and Hannah.  The celebration took
place in May in Buffalo and this October event was designed from the beginning as an
international conference of significance, convened to address, for the first time, the entire
corpus of Creeley’s work.  I asked all participants (excluding the poets) to produce
unpublished but publishable new essays on Creeley’s life and/ or work and all came through
with stellar contributions.  The next step will be publication.  I already have one university
press interested and the consensus of participants that I spoke to preferred a book gathering
over an on-line gathering.  I want to close by mentioning the yeoman work done by the grad
student volunteers in the UB Poetics Program who wrote uniformly admirable introductions to
the poets and speakers and provided essential services in transportation et al.

Thanks to all and God Bless global warming.

Did this incident occur anywhere near the Thai
Elephant Conservation Center, near the town of Lampang
(or near another elephant conservation center, because
apparently at least one other camp in 2000 was
contemplating starting a music project?)  The ellies
there have been granted access to "sturdier versions
of traditional Thai instruments" & indeed harmonicas
are amongst the instruments mentioned In the New York
Times article copied below, one of the various
commentaries to be found at:

http://www.mulatta.org/Thaielephantorch.html

It's pretty funny & delilcious if elephants are
wandering away from their camp  during their "free
time" and serenading those persons (& animals?) they
encounter, or even giving away harmonicas to elephants
who live outside the camp after brief lessons on how
to play them.

Try to listen to the sound samples at the mulatta.org
site, you'll see it's good improvisation.  I keep
meaning to order one of the CDs:

NEW YORK TIMES December 16, 2000

THINK TANK

A Band With a Lot More to Offer Than Talented
Trumpeters
ERIC SCIGLIANO

In the 20 years since a Syracuse zookeeper first
encouraged an elephant's artistic impulses, pachyderm
paintings have become fundraising fixtures at zoos. So
it was probably only a matter of time before someone
decided to try these highly intelligent animals out on
another creative endeavor: music. Now the debut CD of
the Thai Elephant Orchestra is scheduled for release
this month.

The band is the brainchild of Richard Lair, an
American expatriate who has worked with elephants for
23 years and written an encyclopedic United Nations
study of Asia's captive elephants, and David Sulzer, a
neurologist who heads Columbia University's Sulzer
Laboratory and works as a composer and producer under
the name Dave Soldier.

Together they organized six young pachyderm at the
Thai Elephant Conservation Center, a former government
logging camp near the town of Lampang, where elephants
now earn their keep by giving rides, demonstrating
logging skills and painting pictures for tourists.
Elephants are natural candidates for music-making.
Their hearing is much keener than their sight, and
they employ a vast range of vocalizations, many of
which are heard on their CD, to be released by the New
York-based Mulatta Records.

Ancient Romans and Asian mahouts, or elephant
handlers, have noted elephants' ability to distinguish
melodies, and today's circus elephants follow musical
cues. In 1957, a German scientist, Bernard Rensch,
reported in Scientific American that his test elephant
could distinguish 12 musical tones and could remember
simple melodies even when played on different
instruments, at different pitches, timbres and meters.
She still recognized the tones a year and a half
later.

There have been commercial ventures, too. In the
1850's a circus elephant named Romeo cranked a hand
organ while "Juliet" danced, and the Adam Forepaugh
and Barnum & Bailey circuses later fielded "elephant
bands." These "probably sounded like a herd of angry
Buicks," said Fred Dahlinger, research director for
the Circus World Museum in Baraboo, Wis. "They were
all novelty acts, characteristic of their times."

The Thai Elephant Orchestra attempts something
different. Its members play sturdier versions of
traditional Thai instruments - slit drums, a gong
hammered from a sawmill blade, a diddly-bow bass and
xylophone-like renats - and a thundersheet and
harmonicas. Mr. Sulzer said he and Mr. Lair merely
showed the elephants how to make the sounds, cued them
to start and stop, and let them play as they wished.
After five practice sessions, they started recording.
Mr. Sulzer admits he was skeptical at first. "I
thought we would just train elephants to hit
something, and I would tape that and have to paste it
together with other things." Instead, he recorded the
performances intact, without overdubbing, in a teak
grove, pausing only when outside noises intruded.

The players improvise distinct meters and melodic
lines, and vary and repeat them. The results, at once
meditative and deliberate, delicate and insistently
thrumming, strike some Western listeners as haunting,
others as monotonous. Mr. Sulzer wondered whether
Prathida, a 7-year- old orchestra member whom he
called "the Fritz Kreisler of elephants," would
recognize dissonance. "I put one bad note in the
middle of her xylophone. She avoided playing that note
- until one day she started playing it and wouldn't
stop. Had she discovered dissonance, and discovered
that she liked it? She outsmarted the researchers."

Mr. Lair worked out a set of hand signals for the
mahouts to cue the elephants while he was conducting.
He discovered that some "figured out the meaning of
the signals on their own, with no teaching
whatsoever." But is it music? Mr. Sulzer insists it
is. "I have no doubt they're improvising - and
composing, which is the same thing," he declared. To
test out the proposition, he suggested something like
the Turing test of artificial intelligence: play the
CD without disclosing the performers' identity and
then ask listeners the question. For Mr. Lair, it's
simply a matter of interpretation, as in all art:
"Just as there are a lot things they don't understand
about our music, I am sure there are things we will
never understand about theirs."

The proceeds from the CD will go to a milk bank for
orphaned elephants and a school to improve mahout
training - although Mr. Lair concedes that "profits
are highly theoretical at this point." Nonetheless,
Mr. Lair, who not only advises the Conservation Center
but also trained the elephants for the Disney movie
"Dumbo Drop," is sensitive to any charges of
exploitation. Elephants should not be "incarcerated
and made to do slave labor," he writes in the new CD's
liner notes. With habitat vanishing and logging banned
in Thailand, however, there's little alternative to
tourist-camp work. At least, he says, making "gorgeous
noises of their own volition" is light and pleasurable
duty: "What better job than to be in the prison band?"


Mr. Lair and Mr. Sulzer are devising new instruments
and seeking new talent. They say one 3-year-old has
already proved a prodigy, and another elephant camp is
trying to develop an orchestra. Meanwhile, a second,
"easy-listening" recording, "code-named the `Schlock
CD," is on the way, Mr. Lair writes, mixed to be
accessible to a wider audience.

The Grand Piano is an amazing machine. "Grand" like an old high
flying flag, or a street or avenue
in a neighborhood that used to be a central hub called downtown.
Often it crosses Broadway.
Broadway may have more songs, just like Georgia gets more songs than
Houston, but "Funky Grand"
doesn't have to sound (or mean) funky bland, especially if James
Booker could play it. There's a picture of
Booker playing one on my refrigerator. I don't know if it's a baby.
At what point does it become a toddler?
But more importantly, at what point will there be more public access
to grand pianos, when even a good upright
is hard to find buried beneath the karaoke machines. It's much more
difficult to see the pianist's face (and more difficult for the
pianist to see your face) over an upright than it is over a grand.
But a grand also takes up more room. It's a grand accident that this
book and the authors it writes have more room and thus recognizable
faces, and also that it's upright enough not to be wheeled out from
the cafe and into the chilly wind near the corner of  what used to be
called Love and what is still called Haight.

All boys come disguised, especially from girls.
Here is juicy knowledge, lessons maybe no one
previously quilled. Relax, sit tight,
uncover villains while x-raying y-chromosome zone.

kite tail press (a division of Paper Kite Press) is pleased to
announce the publication of:

Boys, A-Z (A Primer), by Dan Waber

The abecedarius is a poem with 26 words. The first word starts with
"a", the second with "b", the third with "c", and so on.

A cycle of abecedarius re-envisions the alphabet as a loop, instead of
a line. The first poem goes from a-z, the second from b-a (through z),
the third from c-b (through z then a), and so on.

The book is a cycle of abecedarius poems which aims to instruct young
girls about the various types of boys to be avoided (in short, all of
them).

Includes illustrations by the author.

The first four poems:

Adam builds computers,
digital engineerings finagle gates,
his insistent keystrokes lay most networks open,
plunder quarantined remote systems.
This uninhibited vandal will X10 your zippers.

Billy can dance,
every Friday goes hip-hopping,
it's just kicks, limbo, mambo,
no orchestra plays quick rhythm steps,
the upstairs vanishes when XM-enabled yahoos zootsuit around.

Charlie doesn't eat fish,
grains, hamburger, instant juice,
kiwi, lemons, mangoes, nectarines or pork.
Queer religious sects take unhealthy vows.
Why X-rate your zaftigness? Appetites belong.

David's experimental fashions grow hilarious.
Imagine Jello knickers. Lavender maribou nightshirts.
Off-center pinstriped quilted red shoulderpads.
Tight underwear. Various weird x-shaped yarmulkes.
Zany aluminum boots. Cowbells.

Perfect-bound softcover books are US$8 if you want to stop by the
press and pick one up in person, or US$10 including shipping to
anywhere with postal service.

Signed and numbered hardcover copies are also available for US$25.

Institutional and teaching discounts available, please inquire.

To express your interest in owning a copy of this book, please send an
email to your favorite word (whatever that may be) at logolalia.com
requesting method of payment details.

Regards,
Dan

Thank you for your discussion of what "broken syntax" means.  I take it that Gertrude Stein might be considered an early practitioner of this.  Not always, of course.  But some of her poetry was considered "nonsense" when it first appeared.  Now "non-sense" might seem a better description.  Still, one gets something out of it whether it conveys or accepts "understanding" or "meaning."

Marcus, seriously, natural language is not equivalent to machine language so your analogy doesn't hold up. Human brains, being very good at language processing in particular and at parsing and assigning meaning to signs in general, have no trouble "running" a program that doesn't strictly adhere to rules of grammar. More importantly, it's far from settled among the linguists who study such things just what syntax is, and among the literature you will find many writers saying things like some sentence p is well-formed in such and such a dialect, and not well-formed in another. What well-formed means is determined solely by the intuitions of native speakers and any attempt to formalize syntax begins by trying to capture all of the well-formed sentences in a dialect while excluding those that are not well-formed. This is a difficult task and again, there is disagreement among linguists as to what is the best and most naturalistic way of going about doing it.

To that end, the idea that syntax can be "broken" at all is just a sort of shorthand for using sentences that are not well-formed as a poetic device. As such, what determines how well it is done are the same criteria for how well the any device is deployed. It can be done well, like how i do it, or it can be done poorly, as Joseph Massey does occasionally. So to answer your long running question, for me at least, as a writer who finds a lot of room for creativity in working with sentences that are not well-formed, what "breaking the syntax" can mean is anything from mixing dialects to creating ambiguities of meaning by denying a specificity to a subject or object within a sentence, to various paratactical structures, to intentionally creating nonsense poetry (jabberwocky for ie) that forces a reader to focus on the sounds of words rather than their grammatical function, to creating sentences
where homonyms with different grammatical functions can coexist at the same point in a sentence and thereby take on a bivalence not generally available in well-formed sentences. All of these things and more are possible when a writer is not handcuffed to the syntactical rules of Standard English and is willing to explore what meanings can occur if those rules are ignored, or replaced by other rules. which is another way of breaking syntax, simply making up a sentence structure that did not exist previously. People are good at finding the meaning in such things, and it simply requires a certain amount of open mindedness for a person to understand such devices, particularly when they are employed with skill.+

NEW from TARPAULIN SKY PRESS
Chad Sweeney's _ A Mirror to Shatter the Hammer _
Chapbook. Poetry.
5.5" x 7.5", French flaps, pamphlet-sewn, 32 pages
$10 includes domestic shipping
http://www.tarpaulinsky.com/Press/Sweeney/index.html

_A Mirror to Shatter the Hammer_ offers poems of remarkable presence and
surprise. A cast of old world and postmodern narrators cohabit these sparse
fables, at once deranged, shrewd, naive, and mildly heroic. One woman
filibusters her own wedding. An exasperated economist shouts to whomever is
listening, "Our great middle class sways on a stool. I apologize. I
apologize." These lyrics slip through De Chirico landscapes, postures and
frames of reference, playing hide and seek as "a film projected onto a
running horse." We find our own grandparents here, exhausted but alert,
discussing turnips and wars before we were born. The known world, the solid
world opens irreparably onto "cave flowers in bouquets of yellow steam" or
"static from a sermon." A carpenter plays a xylophone with two hammers. A
Marxist makes use of a burning palace for his "sensible reading lamp."
Beyond its ironic tensions, _A Mirror to Shatter the Hammer_ evokes an
abiding tenderness and wonder. These are love poems-written by everyone to
no one in particular.

        In a two-dimensional house
        the stairs are drawn of chalk.
        A flat sun holds dominion
        in the mirror, dear reader,

        and the basement is a theory.


Poems from _A Mirror to Shatter the Hammer_ appear in Slope, New American
Writing, Verse, Black Warrior Review, Pool, Transfer, and elsewhere.

Subject:      I was thinking today...
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="iso-8859-1"
Content-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable

I was thinking today how the last two women in my life, when asked by =
their family and friends what I do, told them that I'm retired! I =
thought this was because they were ashamed that I'm a writer. I was =
thinking about it today because I'm reading Henry Miller's "The Time of =
the Assassins: A Study of Rimbaud." Miller writes, "Never did I dream of =
showing my parents anything I had written, or even discussing the =
subject with them. When I first informed them that I had decided to =
become a writer, they were horrified; it was as though I had announced =
that I was going to become a criminal. Why couldn't I do something =
sensible, something that would enable me to gain a living? Never did =
they read a line of what I have written. It was a sort of standing joke =
when their friends inquired of me, when they asked what I was doing. =
'What is he doing? Oh, he is writing...' As though to say, he's crazy, =
he's making mud pies all day long."

It was much the same for me with my parents. I realized today, with =
regards to the two women (I never spoke to them about this), that I =
don't think they were ashamed that I was a writer, but that what I write =
doesn't fit into any category that their family or friends would =
understand. God knows, I don't know what to say when people ask, "What =
do you write?" I just tell them to look at my web site. And then I =
usually never hear from them again. Or, if I do, they don't bring up the =
subject of writing again.

Well, as Bob Creeley liked to say, "Onward!"

Oh, I get it.  Meter, like in Peruvian vanguardista poet Carlos
Oquendo y Amat's "Cinco metros de poemas," which were meant to be
unfolded to a length of five meters.

Was that a sudden zephyr or the sound of farting around with language?

Vout-a-reenie, as Slim Galliard would prosaically say (thanks, David!).

I've found marjorie perloff's discussion of Stein in *Wittgenstein's Ladder* to be really formative of my ideas in this regard and i have a copy of tender buttons that's almost unreadable at this point for all the marginalia. What's most important, i think, is to allow for the strangeness of the parataxis while recognizing that there is still meaning present, and that there is still sense to be made.

News of the opening of this brilliant new (now) archive with some
incredible readings, and a launch to celebrate its launch. Reply to
Andrea.Brady@brunel.ac.uk if you'd like to know anything more.
Apologies for cross-posting.


Dear friends,



I am pleased to announce the launch of



the ARCHIVE OF THE NOW



a capacious and good-looking site for the preservation of UK poetry
to be found at:

http://www.archiveofthenow.com/ and http://www.archiveofthenow.net/
<http://www.archiveofthenow.com/>



At present, the Archive hosts recordings by over 60 UK-based poets,
many of which have been newly commissioned, and individual webpages
providing bibliographic information, sample texts, reviews,
statements and graphic work by each of these poets.  Files are
available for free download.  Over time, additional recordings,
performances, video and other documentation will be posted on the
site for these and other poets.



It is hoped that the Archive will offer new approaches to difficult
poetries through the pleasures of vocal performance. The site is not-
for-profit, and focuses on what we can for brevity and controversy's
sake call 'experimental' or late modernist? writing.  The site will
expand to include as many poets working within this tradition as
possible; the present collection provides a foundation for
discussion, enjoyment and study.  Readers' feedback will be essential
in helping to structure and build this new resource.



The Archive is intended to facilitate conversations and
collaboration, to support emerging writers and to contextualise the
work of established practitioners within an extended and diverse
literary community.  It celebrates friendly exchange, cultural
fortitude and solidarity.  Rather than firing off another polemical
volley in the boring 'poetry wars,' it offers the multitude of
practices of these extraordinary writers as a working definition of
what experiment is, what banality is not, and where a politicised
aesthetic might keep going from here.



Please visit the website, download, give us feedback, link to us/
send us your links, circulate this announcement -- and enjoy!



Anyone in reach of London is also cordially invited to the archive's



LAUNCH PARTY



Thursday, 9 November 2006

7-9 pm sharp



Jerwood Space

Union Street, London

(nearest tubes: Southwark 4 mins, Waterloo and Borough 10 mins)



This event will celebrate the launch of the Archive of the Now, and
of books recently published by Barque Press:



Singularity Stereo by Allen Fisher

Green Light by Ian Hunt

A New Book from Barque Press Which They Will Probably Not Print by
Marianne Morris

Loving Little Orlick by Kevin Nolan



There will be very brief readings by Allen Fisher, Ian Hunt, Marianne
Morris and John James, a computer where you can listen to the
Archive, and FREE DRINK!



Come and celebrate this great collective enterprise and keep me
company.  We will have to leave the space at 9 and adjourn to one of
the many nice nearby pubs, so do try to make it for as close to 7 as
possible.



very best wishes,

Andrea

Hijackin' tha Airwaves:
Radio Revolution


It was a typical night in the studios of WTHG (We Thug
Radio) as DJ Pimp Dad started to play the Chicken
Little Soup Dance for the 5th time within an hour. He
was just getting ready to give the 411 about the
latest G-Unit beef when a squad of Brothers and
Sisters with dreads and headwraps bumrushed the
studio. Pimp Daddy grabbed his gold plated pimp cup
and made a mad dash for the exit as DJ Afrika Black
threw promotional copies of "Fry that Chicken" at him
all the way to the parking lot...

Radio has a long relationship with the struggle for
Black empowerment. During the 60's, it not only was
the avenue by which "I'm Black and I'm Proud" reached
the masses but it was the source of vital information
by which people organized. After all, how would the
people ever have known about the protest in front of
City Hall if DJ Big Bob hadn't hipped the folks that
somethin' major was going down, downtown.

What would the Soul Children of the 70's have done if
it wasn't for Righteous Rudy playing songs like "Fight
the Power." The Brothers and Sisters sure would have
been in the dark had it not been for Sweet Sista Soul
tellin' everybody "what it is, what it was, and what
it willl be" on her morning program "Tellin' it Like
it Is."

But that was then and this is now.

The songs about fighting the power have been traded in
for songs that celebrate Brothers killing Brothers.
The announcements about organizing for Black
LIBERATION have been replaced by free ticket give
aways to the Ying Yang after party at Magic Fingers
Strip Club Massage Parlor and Chicken Hut. And since
the FCC no longer requires radio stations to provide
public affairs programing, the crtical need to know
information about genocidal plots to destroy Afrikan
babies has been replaced by round the clock coverage
of Jay Z and Beyonce's wedding plans...

But out of darkness comes the light. Just when you
were ready to throw your FM Radio out tha window, here
comes Shiari's Radio to the rescue. The show which is
hosted by the soulful Sista "Miss Mona" (Monica
Daye) and the Revolutionary "Da Poet" Tim Jackson airs
every Friday night 8PM -10PM EST on WXDU 88.7 in
Durham NC and world wide on the net at
http://www.wxdu.org .

The dynamic duo is bringing back the days when radio
not only made you feel good about being Black but gave
you information to let you know why you should be
Black and Proud! They are currently seeking Brothers
and Sisters with positive music/Hip Hop/poetry to
submit their work to be played for the world to enjoy.

Also at 9PM they kick off the "Spit that Poetry Hour"
where the top Conscious Hip Hop and Spoken Word
artists on the planet kick their freestyles to the
universe. You never know who will check in on Shairi's
Radio on any given night to drop a jewel of WISDOM on
the people.

It is important that we support Shairi's Radio so that
they can give the Conscious Community what we have
been missing for far too long.
As LL Cool J once said "You know I can't live without
my radio." Thanks to Shairi's Radio, we don't have
to....

I have been involved with this sort of struggle about media
accountability for a very long time. I think I can safely say when I
speak, especially for a lot of us who are in communities of color,
dealing with the onslaught of media injustice and distortion has been --
has forced us to be in the fight, whether we care to be in it or not.
Turning on the evening news and constantly seeing depictions of black
males as criminals, unintelligent, and every other negative pathology
that people like to talk about, and the Bill O'Reillys of world make a
good living off of misreporting, has forced us to be in this fight, and
it's been going on for a long time. But there was a time where you
wouldn't have this many people coming together to talkabout reforming
and changing the media, so give yourselves a lot of props for being out
here, because this is a very strong showing. -- davey d -- "Hip Hop

Muslims in Lebanon, Iran, Iraq and occupied Palestine mark International
Quds Day
20/10/2006


Around 1,000 Lebanese women demonstrated Friday on the Israeli border to
mark international Al-Quds (Jerusalem) Day. The women gathered close to
a barbed wire at the Fatima Gate crossing on the UN Blue Line, waving
Palestinian, Lebanese and Hezbollah flags. The Lebanese army prevented
the crowd from heading for the crossing, while Israeli troops observed
the demonstration through binoculars. An initiative started by Iranian
revolutionary leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, Quds Day is held
annually on the last Friday of the Muslim fasting month of Ramadan and
calls for Jerusalem to be returned to the Palestinians. Similar
demonstrations are being held in occupied Palestine, Iraq and occupied
Palestine. Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad said that Israel would
not survive and that its allies would face the "boiling wrath" of the
people if they continued to support the Jewish state. "This regime will
be gone, definitely," Ahmadinejad told demonstrators marking the
International Quds Day in Tehran. "If a hurricane starts be rest assured
that the dimensions of this hurricane will not be limited to the
geographic borders of Palestine," he added. "This regime (Israel) will
take its supporters to the bottom of the swamp." "The best solution is
for you to take all the components of the regime and take it away," he
said. In Baghdad and other Iraqi cities and towns, thousands of Iraqis
took to the streets to condemn Israel and demand that Jerusalem be
handed back to Palestinians. In the meantime, tens of thousands of
Muslims converged on Islam's third-holiest site, the Al-Aqsa mosque
compound in Jerusalem, to attend the last Friday prayers of the holy
month of Ramadan. As every Friday, Israeli occupation troops ban men
under 45 and women under 35 from entering Jerusalem to pray.

city goes crazier than the gaza on a moving day and waiting to increase
military budgets so our gay friendly troops can go die for israel and
slaughter some iraqis and now iranians after the afghanis – for the same
illogical parasitic settler plantation = israel. And if we object to
this curious misadventure – we get sent to the police department,
harassed and our muslims neighbours get to be threatened and their faith
disrespected and even sent to a special prison, just like in the u.s.

Danspace Project Presents:
=20
BETONTANC "Wrestling Dostoievsky"
Thursday,  Oct. 19 and Friday, Oct. 20 at 8:30PM, Saturday, Oct. 21 at
7:30PM
 =20
From its home-base in Ljubljana, Slovenia, Betontanc brings Wrestling
Dostoievsky, a dance-theater variation of Fyodor Dostoyevsky's classic nove=
l
Crime and Punishment.  A work both poetic and in-your-face, Wrestling
Dostoievsky is set in a tranquil domestic carpeted room, warmly lighted wit=
h
household lamps.  The audience surrounds the space and bears witness to the
joys and the violence of human interactions.  The characters are, in turn,
beautiful, seductive, lustful, raucous, and cruel.  They are representative
of the region; they are citizens of the world.  What moves the protagonists
in their deeply expressive exploration of existence and identity may be
infantile and ridiculous or brutal and violent, but the audience is always
confronted with a breath-taking reality.

 >>What's most important, i think, is to allow for the
strangeness of the parataxis while recognizing that there is
still meaning present, and that there is still sense to be
made.


Charles Dickens sometimes used parataxis, but it's not
always a big hit at the publisher's. Not always. With some.
Some editors. The nasty ones. From major houses.



Gertrude Stein: The one is on the table. The two are on the
table. The three are on the table. The one, one is the same
length as is shown by the cover being longer. The other is
different there is more cover that shows it. The other is
different and that makes the corners have the same shade the
eight are in singular arrangement to make four necessary.

Editor rejecting Stein's manuscript: "I am only one, only
one, only one. Only one being, one at the same time. Not
two, not three, only one. Only one life to live, only sixty
minutes in one hour. Only one pair of eyes. Only one brain.
Only one being. Being only one, having only one pair of
eyes, having only one time, having only one life, I cannot
read your MS three or four times. Not even one time. Only
one book, only one look is enough. Hardly one copy would
sell here. Hardly one. Hardly one. Many thanks. I am
returning the MS by registered post. Only one MS by one post."

I, too, thought it an excellent response to

Hey, since Gertrude Stein's name came up, anyone know
where I can find the text of her "incline?"

in for a treat. Every offbeatnik who's heard of us wants to participate.
We're collaborative multimedia (word, art, audio, graphics, cartoons,
animations) and OPEN to all sorts media hybrids, if they make us turn
cartwheels.  And ... we don't publish the same wonderful writers again and
again (there's a waiting period contributors).  We're looking for ...

"Around us, everything is writing; that's what we must perceive. Everything
is writing. It's the unknown in oneself, one's head, one's body. Writing is
not even a reflection, but a kind of faculty one has, that exists to one
side of oneself, parallel to oneself: another person who appears and comes
forward, invisible, gifted with thought and anger, and who sometimes,
through her own actions, risks losing her life. Into the night." --

For the next few months, we will be publishing small sets of customized
vocabularies based on popular news items. The vocabularies will feature
a set of new words which (fingers crossed) have never before existed in
the common vocabulary known as the English language.

The vocabulary words and accompanying definitions are computer generated
using a multi-step definition generator. Output of the generator will be
enhanced and tweaked over time as new theories are tested and new ideas
come to light. More information on the GTR Dictionary Project can be
found here : http://www.gtrlabs.org/projects/dictionary

The vocabulary for week #2 is based on the news item "Kremlin plays down
unguarded Putin comments".

You are invited to a performance of
WALKING POEM

Wednesday, October 25th
12pm onwards

beginning at the Picasso statue in Daley Plaza
50 W. Washington Street -- Chicago, IL
free

Poet and artist Jennifer Karmin is collecting writing
about walking in cities and creating a WALKING POEM.
On October 25th, she will start walking from Chicago's
Picasso statue and navigate the city using the
collected writing as her map.  Once read outloud, each
piece will be given away to passing pedestrians.  A
gesture similar to Pablo Picasso's, who gave his
sculpture as a "gift to the people of Chicago" and
refused a fee for this work.

Participating writers include:
Emily Abendroth, Diane DiPrima, Phayvanh Luekhamhan,
Bob Marcacci, Philip Metres, Erika Mikkalo, Shin Yu
Pai, Tony Trigilio, Luis H. Valadez, Lina R.Vitkauskas
and more...

WALKING POEM is being sponsored by "Chicago Calling: a
24-Hour Arts Festival," a series of collaborative art
events taking place throughout Chicago on October
25th.  The first "Chicago Calling" event will begin at
12 a.m. on Wednesday, October 25th and the final event
will end at midnight on that day.  October 25th was
chosen as the date of "Chicago Calling" because it is
Pablo Picasso’s birthday.  The complete schedule is at
http://www.chicagocalling.org.


Submissions
*********************************************
Writing for WALKING POEM may be submitted through
October 23, 2006.  This writing may be about any city
and take any shape or form -- poem, story, essay,
letter, etc.  All writing will considered for 2007-08
publication.  Writers should send published or
unpublished writing along with one direction (forward,
backwards, right or left) and one number (1 - 92,
Picasso's age at death).  Submissions may be emailed
as a word attachment with the subject WALKING POEM to
jkarmin@yahoo.com.


"Chicago Calling: a 24-Hour Arts Festival"
*************************************************
Chicago-based artists will showcase performances and
projects that involve collaborations with artists
living in other locations — here in the U.S. and in
other countries worldwide.  Artists involved with
"Chicago Calling" work in a range of media, including:
music, painting, photography, poetry, and dance.
Their collaborations will be prepared, improvised, or
a combination of both.  Some will involve live feeds
between Chicago and elsewhere.  This festival is part
of Chicago Artists' Month, organized by Chicago's
Department of Cultural Affairs
(http://www.chicagoartistsmonth.org).

So, like, um, is that a portmanteau? Of what and language? Sort of
'computing' and 'language'? I have no idea what a style might be that is
able to express persons independent of styles, but it's provocative. So is
the notion that music arises from a common tough who applies abstractions to
a language.

The whole project is wonderfully and certainly unusually thoughtful in its
approach to digital poetry/writing.

Bravo!

Subject:      Performance with Incidences in Geneva 10/20/06: INTERFERENCE
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII; format=flowed

[This may be of interest here - I've been doing a series of multi media
performances and working with Foofwa and his dancegroup; last night
Incidences was first performed (I did video/audio); then I performed; the
following is the transcript which was improvised/typed live for the most
part (not all, hence the interference) in relation to the sea of
sight/sound pre- sented.]



Performance with Incidences in Geneva 10/20/06: INTERFERENCE
(after Incidences, Foofwa d'Imobilite & Co.)


INTERFERENCE
I have no idea how to begin. These pieces are explorations
of dance-movement translated into alien spaces. This is sound bounced from
New York to Chicago then back to West Virgnia then back to New York using
Internet 2. Everything is out of sync. Thiis is Foofwa's dance troop doing
a synchronized exercise from "swimming."

It's difficult to figure how to get into this material for me. For one
thing the laptop was acting up. We found a toy gun in California and
scanned it in West Virginia - deconstructing it atthe same time. Ok we did
this with a tree as well

This will go on until I stop it.

Sometimes you get up in the morning and its not the right thing to say. Do
you know the United States is at WAR with Iraq!? I found out today -
that's really bad. They were looking for illegal immigrants and look what
they came up with - WEAPOONS OF MASSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS DESTRUCTION~! I knew
my United States

              MY UNITED STATES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

would come through in the end. And everybody thought that Bush was a two
bit terrorist who was anti-gay? Whatever happened to his daughters?
They're probably fucking Rumseld. I look on this as therapy. While I'm
playiing with software programs (the very latest!_ (not really)) - there
are a numbetr of species going extinct per hour. But they can all move to
the Arcitic. By the way polar bears have turned cannibal and elephants are
raping other species - this is true - as animals find their habitat
disappiearing. What these abstract imags ar - the body is divided into 17
segments and these are then captured while a dancer moves - the movements
are captured - and then - then you can map them on to for example people -
These people practiced for weeks to get it right and I had to pay them to
get naked. Now we can take this mapping of figures onto figures - dancers
onto avatar dancers - and we can map into entirely new spaces and content
- So this is a dancer transformed. Well hell this has no use whatsoever
but I'm fascinated by the extentions of the body - When you play around
with software like this you can enter the world of dreams so quickly... I
can't find my way outshide this world.

Dance. How can I make this entertaining? We shall witness
men and women amputated at the brain! They cannot think!
They can only dance! Dansez Dansez! O Here is Azure being scanned. The
laser destroyed one of my cameras. I have learned not to work in the real
world. ui, c'est tout! Pourquoi?

They are ne real pas, ils dansez le "reel." I make a map of this dance. Je
fabrique un plan von der Unterwelt. They have no Now in order to get away
from legs I have moved into the interior of avatars... So this is what it
looks like from inside -

They have no arms. Quel dommage! Pourqoi? POURQUOI?
Parceque ce'st mois! La Divine! Ceas vrai! Wirklich! I will make
their interieures! Inside them! You will see!

I forgot the trees. Here is a tree being scanned by a laser sending the
signal out - From here you can move deep into the dtree .. there are other
things to see.... You can see the laser burn.

The best way to proceed I think is to hmmm... Is to go into the real world
as little as possible... and then bring back whatever you need like going
to a 7-11 or something - Is this going ok Foofwa? Uh it seems to lack
coherency. I wish I was home making new avatars on my computer to fuck
with.

Later no earlier
in 2006 I don't know what happened, I showed work - real pieces of things
and computers - in Los Angels - you can actually stumble over wires once
you leave home. One absolutely has to know how to inhabit theoretical
digital space. Every other space will become poisonous. This space now
this space here - this space is a ruler being taken apart by a laser - you
can study it and see how measurement began. I keep thinking I've got some
terrible disease and am just about to die (SOB!) so I need your sympathy
vote! This is my partner Azure Azul being deconstructed on a bad hair day.
So I'm thinking of war and extinctions and the nightmare the world is
turning into and atomic bombs going off and being unable to sleep and I
can't help making stupid jokes. Like the maarx brothers - it's a kind of
immigrant fever - More mapping of dancers. Foofwa is the only person I
know who could dance this.

The advantage of a dancer: You'll have your body at the end of the world.
The disadvantage of a dancer: You'll have your body at the end of the
world.

And you will send signals to yourself.
You will send signals to yourself.
You'll look in the mirror and say hello world.
And nothing will say anything back.
Not even you.

Susan Sontag I think wrote about the tens of thousand of birds that died
at 9/11.
In New York they erected a memorial of lights. The lights went high in the
sky and interacted with migrating flocks of birds.
Ten thousand birds died because of the memorial.
So the question is: How do you make art - not after Auschwitz -
but IN Auschwitz? Because we are at the gates and work arbeit does nothing
for us.

Dance, alas, how can I ever make sense? Together we shall see
human beings with brains and minds cut out! They can't think!
They never could! All they can do is dance! Well, really, is
that all? Why for the Sake of God! They're not real now, are
they? They dance the reel! They dance the jig! I'll make a
pretty picture of this dance! I'll make a map of the Underworld!
They have no legs! They don't have arms either! If I could dance - if I
could really dance - I wouldn't be doing any of this - why bother? You
have your body on your back and your back on your body and that's all
you'd need.

When you look at the world correctly, on what basis can you do anything
at all?

Hello I am the world. I don't have anything at al. They don't have
brains either! They don't have minds either! This is terrible
damage! I am a cheese! Why, WHY? For the love of the Dear Lord!
Because it's me! I made them! I'm the Author of the World! The
Divine! The Divine Sarah Bernhardt! The Jew! It's True! Really!
I will make their interiors! We'll go inside them! You and I,
we'll go inside their bellies! We'll wear the Pubic Hair! You'll
see! Just wait! You'll see!

Bonjour, salaam, shalom, hello! I will kill myself! Why is this
night different from all other nights? Because I am here? These
are my people! My little people! They run around the room! I
play my harmonica for you. A little aire, a tiny aire, surely
something you have heard before?
Because we can bounce sound around the world like this.
But we can't stop trade in rhino horns.

Azure struggles with the avatar. The avatar has to avoid the swords. The
swords make the avatar angry. Azure writhes in pain. If she moves she will
be cut by the swords.The swords are dream sword.s They do not exist in
reality. In reality I am home at the moment comfortably seated in front of
my computer. And Im working on new exciting software programs called

RHINO
WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION
ABU GHARAYB (fun to play!)
Guantanamo
Afghanistan
North Korea
Pakistan
United States
China
This is how I imagine EMPIRE - something in the form of a dream. And if
EMPIRE stays a dream then everything then everything will be then
everything will be okay. Then everything will be okay.

Thank you.

Her Lust is Wiser, Disposable Scripture, and Sonja: Life Passes By are
books of verse by Biloxi Andersen and Ziad Noureddine (heteronyms: be
lax in understanding and abundance of eternal light).

Biloxi is a young Nordic European female. Ziad is a young male from
Bedouin Arab roots. The pieces in these books are placed in England and
are concerned with their relationship to each other and to life. These
books are part of an ongoing series of diaries in verse. A fourth book
is currently being edited.

I'm getting my list mail via AOL just fine. Does your announcement mean that
you will remove me or are you just alerting me to a potential problem via AOL?

It's an alert to a potential problem with AOL. If you aren't currently
having a problem, you should have nothing to worry about.

Mike and all - the note is just to alert you to a potential problem
with your subscription to the list.  If a sub through an AOL account
isn't working then you will have to try receiving the list with an

Good deal. Although I guess if I were having a problem I wouldn't have gotten
the message alerting me to the problem.

For the next few months, we will be publishing small sets of customized
vocabularies based on popular news items. The vocabularies will feature
a set of new words which (fingers crossed) have never before existed in
the common vocabulary known as the English language.

The vocabulary words and accompanying definitions are computer generated
using a multi-step definition generator. Output of the generator will be
enhanced and tweaked over time as new theories are tested and new ideas
come to light. More information on the GTR Dictionary Project can be
found here : http://www.gtrlabs.org/projects/dictionary

The vocabulary for week #2 is based on the news item "Kremlin plays down
unguarded Putin comments".

You are invited to a performance of
WALKING POEM

Wednesday, October 25th
12pm onwards

beginning at the Picasso statue in Daley Plaza
50 W. Washington Street -- Chicago, IL
free

Poet and artist Jennifer Karmin is collecting writing
about walking in cities and creating a WALKING POEM.
On October 25th, she will start walking from Chicago's
Picasso statue and navigate the city using the
collected writing as her map.  Once read outloud, each
piece will be given away to passing pedestrians.  A
gesture similar to Pablo Picasso's, who gave his
sculpture as a "gift to the people of Chicago" and
refused a fee for this work.

Participating writers include:
Emily Abendroth, Diane DiPrima, Phayvanh Luekhamhan,
Bob Marcacci, Philip Metres, Erika Mikkalo, Shin Yu
Pai, Tony Trigilio, Luis H. Valadez, Lina R.Vitkauskas
and more...

WALKING POEM is being sponsored by "Chicago Calling: a
24-Hour Arts Festival," a series of collaborative art
events taking place throughout Chicago on October
25th.  The first "Chicago Calling" event will begin at
12 a.m. on Wednesday, October 25th and the final event
will end at midnight on that day.  October 25th was
chosen as the date of "Chicago Calling" because it is
Pablo Picasso’s birthday.  The complete schedule is at
http://www.chicagocalling.org.


Submissions
*********************************************
Writing for WALKING POEM may be submitted through
October 23, 2006.  This writing may be about any city
and take any shape or form -- poem, story, essay,
letter, etc.  All writing will considered for 2007-08
publication.  Writers should send published or
unpublished writing along with one direction (forward,
backwards, right or left) and one number (1 - 92,
Picasso's age at death).  Submissions may be emailed
as a word attachment with the subject WALKING POEM to
jkarmin@yahoo.com.


"Chicago Calling: a 24-Hour Arts Festival"
*************************************************
Chicago-based artists will showcase performances and
projects that involve collaborations with artists
living in other locations — here in the U.S. and in
other countries worldwide.  Artists involved with
"Chicago Calling" work in a range of media, including:
music, painting, photography, poetry, and dance.
Their collaborations will be prepared, improvised, or
a combination of both.  Some will involve live feeds
between Chicago and elsewhere.  This festival is part
of Chicago Artists' Month, organized by Chicago's
Department of Cultural Affairs
(http://www.chicagoartistsmonth.org).

http://gtrlabs.org is a terrific site, David, and your work with Andrew is
fascinating.

So, like, um, is that a portmanteau? Of what and language? Sort of
'computing' and 'language'? I have no idea what a style might be that is
able to express persons independent of styles, but it's provocative. So is
the notion that music arises from a common tough who applies abstractions to
a language.

The whole project is wonderfully and certainly unusually thoughtful in its
approach to digital poetry/writing.

Bravo!

Also, a college/University/community college in NYC that needs a teacher for

[This may be of interest here - I've been doing a series of multi media
performances and working with Foofwa and his dancegroup; last night
Incidences was first performed (I did video/audio); then I performed; the
following is the transcript which was improvised/typed live for the most
part (not all, hence the interference) in relation to the sea of
sight/sound pre- sented.]



Performance with Incidences in Geneva 10/20/06: INTERFERENCE
(after Incidences, Foofwa d'Imobilite & Co.)


INTERFERENCE
I have no idea how to begin. These pieces are explorations
of dance-movement translated into alien spaces. This is sound bounced from
New York to Chicago then back to West Virgnia then back to New York using
Internet 2. Everything is out of sync. Thiis is Foofwa's dance troop doing
a synchronized exercise from "swimming."

It's difficult to figure how to get into this material for me. For one
thing the laptop was acting up. We found a toy gun in California and
scanned it in West Virginia - deconstructing it atthe same time. Ok we did
this with a tree as well

This will go on until I stop it.

Sometimes you get up in the morning and its not the right thing to say. Do
you know the United States is at WAR with Iraq!? I found out today -
that's really bad. They were looking for illegal immigrants and look what
they came up with - WEAPOONS OF MASSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS DESTRUCTION~! I knew
my United States

              MY UNITED STATES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

would come through in the end. And everybody thought that Bush was a two
bit terrorist who was anti-gay? Whatever happened to his daughters?
They're probably fucking Rumseld. I look on this as therapy. While I'm
playiing with software programs (the very latest!_ (not really)) - there
are a numbetr of species going extinct per hour. But they can all move to
the Arcitic. By the way polar bears have turned cannibal and elephants are
raping other species - this is true - as animals find their habitat
disappiearing. What these abstract imags ar - the body is divided into 17
segments and these are then captured while a dancer moves - the movements
are captured - and then - then you can map them on to for example people -
These people practiced for weeks to get it right and I had to pay them to
get naked. Now we can take this mapping of figures onto figures - dancers
onto avatar dancers - and we can map into entirely new spaces and content
- So this is a dancer transformed. Well hell this has no use whatsoever
but I'm fascinated by the extentions of the body - When you play around
with software like this you can enter the world of dreams so quickly... I
can't find my way outshide this world.

Dance. How can I make this entertaining? We shall witness
men and women amputated at the brain! They cannot think!
They can only dance! Dansez Dansez! O Here is Azure being scanned. The
laser destroyed one of my cameras. I have learned not to work in the real
world. ui, c'est tout! Pourquoi?

They are ne real pas, ils dansez le "reel." I make a map of this dance. Je
fabrique un plan von der Unterwelt. They have no Now in order to get away
from legs I have moved into the interior of avatars... So this is what it
looks like from inside -

They have no arms. Quel dommage! Pourqoi? POURQUOI?
Parceque ce'st mois! La Divine! Ceas vrai! Wirklich! I will make
their interieures! Inside them! You will see!

I forgot the trees. Here is a tree being scanned by a laser sending the
signal out - From here you can move deep into the dtree .. there are other
things to see.... You can see the laser burn.

The best way to proceed I think is to hmmm... Is to go into the real world
as little as possible... and then bring back whatever you need like going
to a 7-11 or something - Is this going ok Foofwa? Uh it seems to lack
coherency. I wish I was home making new avatars on my computer to fuck
with.

Later no earlier
in 2006 I don't know what happened, I showed work - real pieces of things
and computers - in Los Angels - you can actually stumble over wires once
you leave home. One absolutely has to know how to inhabit theoretical
digital space. Every other space will become poisonous. This space now
this space here - this space is a ruler being taken apart by a laser - you
can study it and see how measurement began. I keep thinking I've got some
terrible disease and am just about to die (SOB!) so I need your sympathy
vote! This is my partner Azure Azul being deconstructed on a bad hair day.
So I'm thinking of war and extinctions and the nightmare the world is
turning into and atomic bombs going off and being unable to sleep and I
can't help making stupid jokes. Like the maarx brothers - it's a kind of
immigrant fever - More mapping of dancers. Foofwa is the only person I
know who could dance this.

The advantage of a dancer: You'll have your body at the end of the world.
The disadvantage of a dancer: You'll have your body at the end of the
world.

And you will send signals to yourself.
You will send signals to yourself.
You'll look in the mirror and say hello world.
And nothing will say anything back.
Not even you.

Susan Sontag I think wrote about the tens of thousand of birds that died
at 9/11.
In New York they erected a memorial of lights. The lights went high in the
sky and interacted with migrating flocks of birds.
Ten thousand birds died because of the memorial.
So the question is: How do you make art - not after Auschwitz -
but IN Auschwitz? Because we are at the gates and work arbeit does nothing
for us.

Dance, alas, how can I ever make sense? Together we shall see
human beings with brains and minds cut out! They can't think!
They never could! All they can do is dance! Well, really, is
that all? Why for the Sake of God! They're not real now, are
they? They dance the reel! They dance the jig! I'll make a
pretty picture of this dance! I'll make a map of the Underworld!
They have no legs! They don't have arms either! If I could dance - if I
could really dance - I wouldn't be doing any of this - why bother? You
have your body on your back and your back on your body and that's all
you'd need.

When you look at the world correctly, on what basis can you do anything
at all?

Hello I am the world. I don't have anything at al. They don't have
brains either! They don't have minds either! This is terrible
damage! I am a cheese! Why, WHY? For the love of the Dear Lord!
Because it's me! I made them! I'm the Author of the World! The
Divine! The Divine Sarah Bernhardt! The Jew! It's True! Really!
I will make their interiors! We'll go inside them! You and I,
we'll go inside their bellies! We'll wear the Pubic Hair! You'll
see! Just wait! You'll see!

Bonjour, salaam, shalom, hello! I will kill myself! Why is this
night different from all other nights? Because I am here? These
are my people! My little people! They run around the room! I
play my harmonica for you. A little aire, a tiny aire, surely
something you have heard before?
Because we can bounce sound around the world like this.
But we can't stop trade in rhino horns.

Azure struggles with the avatar. The avatar has to avoid the swords. The
swords make the avatar angry. Azure writhes in pain. If she moves she will
be cut by the swords.The swords are dream sword.s They do not exist in
reality. In reality I am home at the moment comfortably seated in front of
my computer. And Im working on new exciting software programs called

RHINO
WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION
ABU GHARAYB (fun to play!)
Guantanamo
Afghanistan
North Korea
Pakistan
United States
China
This is how I imagine EMPIRE - something in the form of a dream. And if
EMPIRE stays a dream then everything then everything will be then
everything will be okay. Then everything will be okay.

Thank you.

"As democracy is perfected, the office of president represents,
more and more closely, the inner soul of the people. On some
great and glorious day the plain folks of the land will reach their
heart's desire at last, and the White House will be adorned by
a downright moron."  -- H.L. Mencken (1880-1956)

DIRT, the premier magazine of minimalist poetry and poetics, has
undergone a radical renovation. Do to funding difficulties and a
diminished staff, publication in print form has come to a halt.

However, to carry on our proud tradition of highlighting and promoting
minimalist work, DIRT will now appear as a regularly updated blogzine;
imagine Bolts of Silk or RealPoetik, but (obviously) minimalist only.
We aim to make 2-4 posts a week, depending on how quickly fresh
material comes in -- so continue submitting your minimalist poetry
(both textual and visual) and short fiction.

We also welcome reviews or material for reviews. Interviews with
minimalist's movers and shakers, past and present, will also appear
from time to time.

New and old work is now available at http://dirt-zine.blogspot.com.
Those up now include: ARAM SAROYAN, ANDY GRICEVICH, and PAUL NELSON.

Best,

Philip Primeau

is that true? I mean, if the catholic church wanted to prevent black men from becoming priests, I didn't think the law had (nor should have, wall of separation and all that) any say in the matter.

Small Press Traffic is pleased to present a reading by

Dana Teen Lomax & Joan Retallack
Friday, October 27, 2006 at 7:30 p.m.

Dana Teen Lomax joins us in celebration of her first full-length collection,
Curren¢y (Palm Press). David Buuck says: “Dana Teen Lomax's work navigates the
vexed relations of life behind the bars of the $$, where gender, race, and
class are not merely ‘discourses’ but lived vectors of experience…. Curren¢y
is nothing less than an oppositional archeology of consumer culture as it
reproduces its logics on and in our bodies—both personal and
body-political—against a field of possibilities increasingly threatened by the
privatization and colonization of the life-world. Writing a radical
biopolitics—a ‘biopoethics’—would be that practice that articulates itself in
resistant song, and, that in Lomax's expanded field, of necessity also dances,
in paroxysms full of both rage and desire.”


Joan Retallack’s most recent book of poetry is Memnoir—a long poem published
in the US (Post-Apollo Press) and in French translation (CIP-Marseilles) in
2004. The Poethical Wager—a volume of essays—came out last year from The
University of California Press which will also publish her forthcoming book on
Gertrude Stein—with  a selection of Stein’s work. Retallack is also the author
of MUSICAGE: John Cage in Conversation with Joan Retallack for which she won
the 1996 America Award in Belles-Lettres and Afterrimages (both from Wesleyan
University Press),  Mongrelisme (Paradigm Press), How To Do Things With Words
(Sun & Moon Classics) , and Errata 5uite (Edge Books). Retallack is currently
at work on a long poetic project, “The Reinvention of Truth.”


Unless otherwise noted, events are $5-10, sliding scale, free to current SPT
members and CCA faculty, staff, and students.

Unless otherwise noted, our events are presented in Timken Lecture Hall,

TEHRAN, Oct.22 (ISNA)-Iran's Saipa Diesel Co. export manager stated that
the Volvo Company has given the entire share of the African market to Iran.

"Based on the signed contracts between our company and the Volvo, the
entire share of the African market is given to Iran and in one year
period, Iran is to export two thousand trucks with various models of
FM12, FM9, FH12 and NH 12 to the African markets," added Saipa Diesel
Co. export manager.

The export program is to begin in late November.

"The total value of these trucks is over 130 million dollars and we have
exported 71 trucks to Kuwait within 6 months and this is going to
increase up to 200 trucks by the end of the year," he added.

"We will market for and export to Arabian countries in the Persian Gulf
region separately," he asserted.

Iran is the world's fourth Volvo truck manufacturer with the annual
manufacture of 10 thousand and 900 trucks per year.

If you have not already goner here, Kevin Tillman - brother of Pat who was
killed in Afghanistan - in his account of the consequences of our current
Junta (Rumsfeld-Bush-Cheney, etc.) rises and comes close to poetry here. I
find it very powerful and to the point.

Subject:      (Call For)Defenses of lying and/or art
In-Reply-To:  <7.0.1.0.1.20061023193919.0395bd00@earthlink.net>

In attempts to 'define' genres (as a form of social engineering),
'poetry' has been often accused, and/or celebrated, for thousands of
years of recorded (largely written) history, as being intimately
bound up in the activity of lying.
While some have, with piercing insight, denied the charge by turning
it on the prosecutor---"by what criteria do you determine the 'truth'
of that which you use as a standard to judge our activity as lies?
Oh, and how long have you been beating your wife?"---others try to
defend poetry by carefully delineating a conceptual and ethical
distinction between "lying" and "art." If "art" must have "artifice"
at its root, is "artifice" a form of lovely necessary lying so
crucial for a happy and healthful life, whether you're bourgeois or
working class? Does "truth" have the same relationship

A book could be written about it (even though many have already), an
album, or at least a weekly all-talk radio (I guess I should say
podcast), in which people clank glasses and laugh and digress around
the central hub of this issue. Maybe after one episode, though, we'd
have to change the topic. Fuck the stranglehold of the station
manager's syllabus, yet without it every idea could be nipped in the
bud (some people are way better at assigning things for others to do
than doing it themselves; this can be a beautiful form of creation
but some call it a failure to put one's money where one's mouth is)

So this is a call for papers! It may not have immediate U-cred or
play by what what one could call "Wayne State rules,"
but it's not necessary exposed to aspects of that style, as if to say
a storming of the gates can't happen without a gating of the storms.

Nah, let others call for papers! (hell, maybe I'll even come running
if there's bed and breakfast and such....)
This is a call, but more for notes, scribbled down, like 'cliches' or
'buzzwords' you find yourself telling or being told (by what you know
not, though you have your theories), as ethical maxims you kinda feel
you're putting on trial.

So, what are your favorite defenses of lying (as opposed to say
imagination or the truth---the less specialized terms),
or questioning the so-called 'truths' presented as such, and granted
much social validity in part do the such presentation?
I use the term "lying' in part because of its wider-applicability,
insofar as you can ask just about any person whether on some level
they believe lying is necessary (even for the sake of the truth) than
you can about the relationship of "lies' or "the imagination.'

A precondition for admission into this this discussion-party is that
people who see themselves as "poets" (or even the slightly wider term
"intellectuals") will only be invited on the precondition that they
bring a friend who they consider very articulate verbally,
intelligent and/or sensitive, but who does not define herself or
himself as a "poet" or "intellectual" or even a "writer" (and,
perhaps it needs to be said, and vice versa)

This discussion party will be held in Oakland---at a space to be
determined, potentially outside, and with other non-verbal forms of
entertainment such as music), and will be recorded for a podcast or
broadcast on the radio. It will be informal and utilize a somewhat
arbitrary (but highly scientific) selection process (see previous
paragraph), but will hopefully become an ongoing occurrence so that
everybody who has something to contribute will be allowed to (not to
sound too utopian, but what the hell....).

What I need now, are very short (no more than a paragraph), quotes,
with some sense of why these quotes, fascinate you, that address this
question of "truth" and/or the necessity of lying. The quote could be
from something in Plato, or Shakespeare, or Holland-Dozier-Holland,
or something Abdul at the corner store told you. The more important
criteria is that this quote troubled you, or made you wonder, and
reopen up the question of whether there's any implications (and if
so, what you are) into your believes about what is, and/or should be,
your relationship to words like 'lies' and 'truth.'

If you're 'clever' enough, I may even allow a 'smartass' (how is that
different than 'dumbass'?---ah, another potential topic---) begging
of the question into the discussion. For instance, if you need to say
that such words as "truth" and "lies"
are NINETEENTH CENTURY WORDS, and thus not worthy of your mental-non-
paying labor, you would have to do A LOT to convince me right now
that this voice hasn't already had enough say in the last century,
but I can be persuaded.

Send your "ABSTRACTS" publicly here on the poetics list (or for those
not on these lists, send them to me personally).
Must be willing to travel to Oakland (or pay for my flight to a venue
in your town---but that can wait till later). After the initial
screening based on the  abstracts, there will be a roughly hour-long
phone conversation that one could view as an 'audition,' though
sometimes that could make one too self-conscious and make it stiffer,
to determine things like verbal personality, charisma, willingness to
think fast on one's feet and also let others' talk, appreciation for
the importance of the non-verbal aspects of the event (can you play
an instrument? if not, would you want to DJ? or be one of the
dancers? how about some graffiti?).

The verbal interview is optional--I mean, you could always just
befriend me, but a modicum of an entrepreneurial interest must have
entered into the discussion as a criteria. We will then begin to
develop a pool, or 'human resources' for a somewhat loose
collectivist commercial enterprise that will at the same time also be
more personally fulfilling and fun than the art, poetry, music, and
general day job/nightlife split as most talker-types know, or
experience, it.

 >>Studds had himself been in a similar situation back in
the 1980s and had been voted back into office several times
afterwards. But Studds didn’t come from the party of
homophobia, and therein lies a difference. What killed
Foley’s career was not pedophilia, but hypocrisy.

Studds actually HAD sex with a 17-year old page. He didn't
come from "the party of homophobia," true, and wasn't a
complete hypocrite like Foley. Long before the Internet,
Studds pursued the traditional "hands on" approach to
molestation. Studds also managed to spin his sexcapade and
eventual relationship to make himself into a gay rights
hero, rather than a felon.

What that shows, I think, is that people don't really care
about adults having sex with minors who are close to the age
of consent. People mostly care about their political
prejudices and about certain kinds of hypocrisy. If one of
the "good guys" beds a minor, that's okay, as long as he's
upfront about it. And one of the "good guys" of course.

domestic life =97 its companionship, its fecundity, its losses =97 and =20=

floor from which the/kingdom of God extends/or could extend.=94

Elizabeth Robinson grew up in Los Alamitos, Califormia. Her most =20

ISBN 1-886224-80-3   original paperback $14


Borrowed voices, invented voices, and a very personal but unplaceable =20=

voice all wind their way through these mock-philosophical meditations =20=

on nature and cosmos. Juxtaposed with her precise and abstract =20
photographs, Doppelt=92s text considers astronomy, weather, the five =20
senses, plant life, the insect world, and the nature of time, all in =20
an implicit dialogue with the pre-Socratics. Often funny, often wry, =20
this book betrays an affectionate love for the world.
     Some pre-Socratic fragments appear translated into a phonetic =20
language by the composer Georges Aperghis.

While teaching philosophy and literature in Paris, Suzanne Doppelt =20
developed an interest in photography and has ever since pursued a =20

and attracted a great deal of attention. It was awarded the Prix de =20
la Pl=E9iade. Between lyric and meditation on Biblical themes, the =20
poems work up to a personal apocalypse.

Jean Grosjean was born in 1912. He became a Roman Catholic priest, =20
but left the priesthood in 1950. He is a noted translator from Near =20
Eastern and other languages: the Koran, books of the New and Old =20

"elocation (or, exit us)"
by Evie Shockley


             the city is american, so she
can map it. train tracks, highways slice   through, bleed
             only to one   side. like a half-red sea
permanently parted, the middle she'd

             pass through, like the rest,   in a wheeling rush,
afraid the divide would not hold and all
             would drown =96   city as almighty ambush =96
beneath the crashing waves of human hell.

             the city's   infra(red)structure sweats her,
a land(e)scape she can't make, though she   knows
             the way.   she's got great heart, but that gets   her where?
egypt's always on her right (it   goes

             where she   goes), canaan's always just a-head,
and to her left, land of the bloodless dead.


"Somewhere in a Dark Auditorium"
by Linda Pennisi

A ballerina will not stop
inserting her small foot
into a slim pink shoe,
criscrossing silk ribbons
over the bone of ankle.
Sometimes I slip into the inside
of her body, where the soul
wells into the walls of that cup
the music, quivering there
like a diver in a swarm
of tropical fishes, her shape brushed
with undulations of hunger
and wonder, a hundred bodies
of tremulous light.  The dancer's shoes
fill with flesh; her flesh
brims with music.  What can she do
with such hunger, such sadness?
What can her body do
but tremble and spill
into dance?

My syntax was a little twisted. I meant that the strictures existed
until recently.

Revelations seem to happen at politically expedient moments. Federal
law couldn't touch polygamy in Utah until there was a revelation, and
the revelation allowing Utah to outlaw it didn't happen until it
became clear that statehood would be withheld until they did.

--- RECENT FEATURES ---

Terayama Shuji - Experimental Image World (7 Volume Collection): Poet, playright, theatre
director, filmmaker, essayist, agitator and lover of all things anarchistic, chaotic, and
truthful, TERAYAMA SHUJI (1936-1983) is one of Japan's most revered and respected
artists. In the heady and extremist Japanese art scene of the late '70s, Terayama created
a number of unforgettable and highly controversial films. EMPEROR TOMATO KETCHUP is his
epic, sexually revolutionary and hallucinatory work from 1972 in which "magical women act
as the initiatory, yet protectively maternal sexual partners to children. The children,
in revolt, have condemned their parents to death for depriving them of self-expression
and sexual freedom; they create a society in which fairies and sex education are equally
important and literally combinable." -- Amos Vogel, Film as a Subversive Art (AVI)
http://www.ubu.com/film/terayama.html

Music With Roots in the Aether: UbuWeb is pleased to announce the relaunch of the AVI's,
RealVideo and MP3s of Robert Ashley's Music with Roots in the Aether, a seminal series of
interviews and performances conceived and realized by Robert Ashley in 1976, consisting
of 14 hours worth of video and audio. Subjects and performers include: David Behrman,
Philip Glass, Alvin Lucier, Gordon Mumma, Pauline Oliveros, Terry Riley, and Robert
Ashley. Robert Ashley says: Music with Roots in the Aether is a series of interviews with
seven composers who seemed to me when I conceived the piece-and who still seem to me
twenty-five years later-to be among the most important, influential and active members of
the so-called avant-garde movement in American music, a movement that had its origins in
the work of and in the stories about composers who started hearing things in a new way at
least fifty years ago."
http://www.ubu.com/film/ashley.html

The Films of Groupe Medvekine Between the March strikes in 1967 at Rhodia in Besançon and
work standardisation at the Peugeot factories in Sochaux, there occurred -- under the
impetus of Chris Marker and his friends -- the constitution and action of the "Medvedkin
Groups" for producing, directing and distributing political films. "A necessary caution:
the "democratization of tools" entails many financial and technical constraints, and does
not save us from the necessity of work. Owning a DV camera does not magically confer
talent on someone who doesn't have any or who is too lazy to ask himself if he has any.
You can miniaturize as much as you want, but a film will always require a great deal of
work - and a reason to do it. That was the whole story of the Medvedkin groups, the young
workers who, in the post-'68 era, tried to make short films about their own lives, and
whom we tried to help on the technical level, with the means of the time." - Chris Marker
http://www.ubu.com/film/groupe_medvedkine.html

Seth Price "Title Variable" UbuWeb is pleased to present a retrospective of Price's
'Title Variable' audio project, from 2001 to the present. In an ongoing series of music
compilations, each concentrating on a technologically transitional but culturally
ill-defined moment within the recent history of digital music production, Price suggests
how production tools have changed music, both in distribution and who controls it as much
as in structure and sound. From early video game soundtracks to New Jack Swing to
Industrial music, Price exploits the genre of "mix tapes" as sound art. As a mass form
operating outside commercial channels, the mix tape seems to stubbornly and perversely
retain its purchase on the imagination long after actual mix-tapes have slipped free of
storage constraints and lost any clear definition.
http://www.ubu.com/sound/price.html

UbuWeb Film & Video Relaunch UbuWeb announces a relaunch of its film and video section.
Greatly expanded with liner notes and links, we're now hosting over 300 avant-garde films
and videos. New additions include works by artists such as Vito Acconci, Alexander
Calder, Merce Cunningham, Harun Farocki, Groupe Medvedkine, Helmut Herbst, Fernand Leger,
Bruce Nauman, Charlemagne Palestine, Shuji Terayama, David Wojnarowicz, Richard Serra,
Piero Heliczer, Paul McCarthy and many more.
http://www.ubu.com/film/index.html

The Films of Maurico Kagel (1965-1983) (AVI) Whether in the classical music hall, the
theatrical stage or film/video, Kagel's neo-dada performances and wickedly original
techniques always opens one's eyes and ears to the pure possibilities of sounds and their
production. Although this aspect of his varied productions is little known in the US,
Kagel's output as a filmmaker is tremendous. He just about made a film or video each year
in the 60s and 70s, and has only begun to slow down in recent times. Films include
"Antithese" (1965), "Match" (1966), "Solo" (1967), "Duo" (1967-68), "Hallelujah" (1969),
"Ludwig Van" (1969), "Blue's Blue" (1981) and "MM51 / Nosferatu" (1983). You can also
listen to Kagel's music here.

Pianoless Vexations (MP3) 8 hours of MP3s recorded live at The Sculpture Center, NYC on
June 11, 2006. Vexations was composed by Erik Satie in 1893 and consists of a short motif
repeated 840 times. Vexations was first performed publicly by John Cage and several other
pianists over the course of 19 hours in 1963. As the title conveys, artists performing in
Pianoless Vexations used any instrument except the piano to perform Satie's original
composition. Instruments included laptops, drums, guitar, French horn, violin, trumpet,
saxophone, viola, recorder, toy piano, harpsichord, mandolin, bass, film projectors,
voice, dulcimer and more. Artists include Randy Nordschow; Hay Sanders; Bruce Pearson and
Marco Navarette; Daphna Mor, Rachel Begley, and Nina Stern; Bruce Arnold Jazz Trio; Alan
Licht and Angela Jaeger; String Messengers; Rusty Santos; Amy Granat; Greg Kelley; Miguel
Frasconi; Bethany Ryker; D. Edward Davis and Erik Carlson; Zachary Seldess; Charles
Waters and Katie Pawluk; Andrew Lampert and Steve Dalachinsky; Margaret Leng Tan; Trudy
Chan; David Grubbs; Goddess; Matthew Ostrowski; Kenta Nagai; Stephin Merritt and Ethan
Cohen; Rick Moody, Hannah Marcus, and Tianna Kennedy.

Fulcrum... where intelligence refuses to die!
   --Charles Bernstein

Poetry in the UK and the US is notorious for its vendettas, closed commun=
ities and border disputes. In contrast, Fulcrum displays an exemplary hos=
pitality to a wide range of poetry and practices. It reminds us why and h=
ow poetry can matter by opening a literal and conceptual space in which a=
ttention can rest on language being brought into activation. Fulcrum is t=
he future.

A relevant pair of quotes for this thread:

"Mary is tampering with the expected sequence.  First she broke the
sentence; now she has broken the sequence.  Very well, she has every
right to do both these things if she does them not for the sake of
breaking, but for the sake of creating.  Which of the two it is I
cannot be sure until she has faced herself with a situation.  I will
give her every liberty, I said, to choose what that situation shall
be; she shall make it of tin cans and old kettles if she likes; but
she must convince me that she believes it to be a situation; and then
when she has made it she must face it.  She must jump."

And further:

"...she had gone further and broken the sequence -- the expected
order.  Perhaps she had done this unconsciously, merely giving things
their natural order, as a woman would, if she wrote like a woman.  But
the effect was somehow baffling; one could not see a wave heaping
itself, a crisis coming around the next corner.  Therefore I could not
plume myself either upon the depths of my feelings and my profound
knowledge of the human heart.  For whenever I was about to feel the
usual things in the usual places, about love, about death, the
annoying creature twitched me away, as if the important point were
just a little further on."

From Virginia Woolf, A ROOM OF ONE'S OWN (1929).

Apparently the reports on the Creeley conference in Buffalo, "On Words," were nudged forth, in part, by a plea from someone who indeed arrived in Buffalo only to miss the events, either presuming them cancelled or lacking proper information on changes to the schedule, etc.  Anyway, having belatedly noticed this thread, I thought I'd point out my little report on www.da-crouton.com

Hi all,

Press, Kitchen Press, Lungfull, Open 24 Hours, Portable Press at Yo-Yo Labs,

Dear Friends of Chicagopostmodernpoetry.com:

Earlier in the week I was my irascible self complaining about the U of
Chicago's terrible reading times like Sisyphus. Thanks to the great efforts
of John Tipton, Mary Margaret Sloan and Peter O'Leary of the Chicago Poetry
Project the poetry community of Chicago will get to hear Michael Palmer Read
this Saturday at 3 PM in the Harold Washington Library along with local
Chicago poet and translator John Tipton. Please come out and support the CPP
and their efforts to bring a poet of this calibre to Chicago's poetry
community I for one will be there---

FOR ROBIN BLASER

So what is this After after?

Beginning.

Man or nobody was before

a miracle
a mirror and terrible

Who are you?

The actor possible
only as speaker
cannot will her disclosure
her demon of a shadow
universe

Speak in the war.
You will disclose nothing
            mere talk
            mere propaganda
            lip service.

We are
in oracles

parrots as signs

not things

being in between
being webbing

puppets
of invisible hands.

inception =AD from BRUT
=20
7pm a crumpled net on a distant road circled her around to prior noon, same
grey net held her hand [insert hand for prophet like a puppet insertion
slit] & disregarded. twenty bucks for her soundtrack, phoned herself to say
<<**HIT**>>. the homophone's just the tip of the =8Cberg. she has white hot
bursts in various corporeal locations, keeping on. large format lead as
scalpel following the gut's infernally anfractuous meander. many of us draw
this archetype when we need to be new. in mode, some derive in the felling,
the hands-on. deadly new.

Origins
-sort of after Adam DeGraff

Insanity brings the condition of past selves sifted from the present self
as a metaphor for the presentiment of failure that I am at any one time
experiencing. Perhaps the memory of June sex on a striped sheet
at the indefatigable age of nineteen, or the new girl in the first grade
who's daddy told her not to play with brown girls. Both the elusive
reason for this rule and the feelings arising from its practice
were deterrents to compulsory social development. When I am far
less congested, I will follow memory down to the first abandoned self,
which some argue began at birth, others, conception. Origins end
the question of insanity.

friends,

-- i have got back with copious notes and a soul full of the poverty in that
land -- i became very ill due to a preexisting health condition and had to
return early -- but i don't believe this is the end of the mission

-- the colombians speak softly, they answer questions in riddles, the land
touches its people through poems of evasion, falseness, and the open doors
of simile -- listening to the conditions of the city's slum i kept asking
myself what the mistake was, that led to 100 of houses collapsing in a
mudslide, when it rains -- or if the lesson missed is the value of tears --
while the governments of our country and theirs turns its back on the poor
-- someone has to tell -- who can tell it who can tell any of it -- a double
self is lurking in the slum and there are ways to set the double ness free
-- the strange leaf-ridden trees have been cut on the steeply sloping,
winding streets -- the weathered two-by-four fences are torn -- the
corrugated tin roofs leak -- onto dirt floors and rusted furniture -- but
the tiny black dogs are barking, and they wag their tails -- the departement
or county, or city, i am not sure government has placed the people without a
systematic response, and so it is the place for the people to respond --
they have been abandoned by the state, but it is possible to hear them
through nonviolence and indirection -- at least 75% of the people of this
city live in poverty

-- this is not more clear, i'm sorry, i'm still sick, but will be better
soon

-- i don't know what's next, but i can feel there's more

As someone who suffered from petit mal seizures for thirty years (fortunately I don't have them anymore due to surgery and medicine), I find these two postings annoying.  Am I right to be annoyed?  Anyway, for what it's worth, which may or may not be much, I felt obliged to register my reaction(s) here.

You have the right to express your feelings. As a person who has lived with
Tourette syndrome for 50+ years, I don't enjoy reading facile (and usually
stupid) remarks about a condition that has left thousands of people socially
stigmatized, often to extreme degrees. Say your piece. You might educate
someone. Good luck!

=8B=8B=8B=8B=8B-

*Mooncalf Press*

Mooncalf Press is located in Philadelphia. Their latest book is Spring Diet
of Flowers at Night by Frank Sherlock. Other books include Ways to Use Lanc=
e
by Brett Evans and (end-begin w/chants) by Frank Sherlock and CAConrad.

*Performer Bios*

**Kristen Gallagher, originally from Philadelphia, is now attempting to
prove that it IS nearly impossible for working class people to make it in
NYC. Look for her work suing NY landlords on upcoming episodes of The
People's Court (the new location of the American justice system).

**Frank Sherlock is the author of Spring Diet of Flowers at Night (Mooncalf
Press), ISO (Furniture Press), and 13 (ixnay press), and he has engaged in
collaborative projects with CAConrad, Jennifer Coleman, and sound artist/DJ
Alex Welsh. He is a contributing editor for XConnect: Writers for the
Information Age.

*music*

**Pepi Ginsberg was raised in the woods of the northeast by her Canadian
mother, Karyn Issa, an artist and teacher, and later her stepfather. She
spent her summers painting with her Russian grandmother and singing songs
about mosquitoes to her grandfather's boisterous accordion. She attended th=
e
local public high school, occasionally acting in school plays, and
writing/editing for the literary magazine, a post that Truman Capote once
filled. Ginsberg moved to Philadelphia and made her days through further
schooling writing poems and drawing in the back of lecture halls. During th=
e
fall mornings of her 19th year she penned the novella No Name, Colorado
which may or may not be lost. Eventually disenchanted by the university
scene, Ginsberg found herself with the artists and musicians haunting
Philadelphias warehouses and parks, putting on plays and dancing to gypsy
music on Solstice eve. During this time Pepi wrote and recording her own
songs, and by the following year compiled what would come to be her first
album, Orange Juice: Stephanie/Stephanie. Pepi moves along the parabola,
understanding the craft of song to be a glorious and perpetual nearness to
the thing it is, that which we are and can be. Pepi's songs delve into
lyrical territory as yet uncharted, her language and song structure are
inventive and complex, giving voice and context to ideas not spoken to or
addressed in far too long. In a time where you cant say it that way anymore=
,
Pepi Ginsberg makes it new. Ginsberg's songs are as durable as they are
true.=20

**So L'il, a psychedelic lounge folk band, is comprised of Ben Malkin and
Frances Sorensen. In the last four years So L'il has released a 6-song
self-titled EP, one split 7-inch with the band Timesbold (both on Neko
Records), the full-length Revolution Thumpin, and their most recent
full-length, Dear Kathy, both on Goodbye Better. They are recording a new
album at Emandee Studios in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, and are featured on the
upcoming Electronic Bible 3 on White Label Music in Europe.

People *don't* know (as evidenced by the classic Primeau sneer at this
thread). I have full-throttle seizures in the most inconvenient places,
like a staircase -- rather Duchamp, except I wasn't nude -- and I want a
nickel for every time somebody sees art they don't like or a bad tattoo
and breezily says, "Wow, it looks like the artist was having a seizure."
This is where the classic expression from Japanese manga, "...", comes
to mind; the person making the remark may just not be ready to hear what
it's like to be doing the fish fandango on the floor, irritated,
embarrassed, possibly injured, and absolutely trapped in a body that has
seceded from your union and gone off to Riverdance without you.

an anthology of writing on queer femme identity
Editor: Maria Angeline
Publisher: Merge Press
Submissions Deadline: March 15, 2007
Anticipated Publication Date: Spring 2008
Femmes are still invisible. Society can't see past our heels to hear our
stories, so we must continue to build platforms for our voices. Visible:
A Femmethology, a forthcoming anthology about the power and
complications in presenting femme as a gender and breaking the
traditional meaning of feminine, aims to showcase blunt, personal essays
exploring what "femme" means to those who claim it as an identity.
Give me your experiences, your inner dialogues, your theories and
practices. Please do not send fiction, poetry, erotica, or any material
to which you do not fully own the rights. I am seeking prose that is
thoughtful, analytical, raw, challenging, exploratory, and uniquely you.

Submissions must be sent as Word files with text in 12 point Times New
Roman font. Essays must be previously unpublished, 1500-6000 words in
length, and typed double-spaced. You may submit more than one essay.
Author maintains and controls the copyright of their essay and licenses
their First North American Rights to Merge Press for publication
purposes. Author retains the right to reprint the material in any
publication.
Send SUBMISSIONS ONLY to Maria Angeline at femmethology at mergepress
dot com. Include your legal name, pseudonym (if any) you wish to use,
address, phone number, email, and the bio you would like to appear in
the book if your selection is chosen for publication. Put the title of
your essay in the subject line of the email. Each essay must be emailed
separately.
Send questions to Maria Angeline at maria.angeline at mergepress dot
com.
Visible: A Femmethology, an anthology of writing on queer femme
identity, is expected to be released in 2008. Do not email to inquire
about the status of your submission after you receive a confirmation
that it has been received. It is not possible to respond to all email
inquires. Once selections have been made, every person who has submitted
work will be sent an announcement. Please do not submit material if you

dear po'folks, my 17-year-old son tolemy is headed for new york city.  i
think he's told his father that he has a place to stay, but i think this
is iffy.  does anyone there have a couch he could crash on for the next 4
days?  he's taking the chinatown bus up here to boston on the 1st.  you
would not be responsible for him, just for his sleep place.  i would be
most grateful.  all best, gabe

CFP:  “Small Presses/Little Magazines of the Mimeograph Revolution: Their
Audiences and the Role of Printing Technologies”
Proposed Panel for The Society for the History of Authorship, Reading and
Publishing (SHARP) Conference, Minneapolis, Minnesota
July 11-15, 2007

The readership for twentieth century little magazines and small presses has
often been considered a narrow one, with the majority of readers being those
interested in experimental or avant-garde literature.  The Mimeograph
Revolution of the 1960s resulted in an explosion in the number of little
magazines and small presses, particularly in the United States, Canada and
the UK. While the focus continued to be on “new writing,” the community of
publishers and writers of this movement brought a grassroots ethos to
literary publishing in opposition to what was perceived to be the domination
of academic criticism and the commercialization of mainstream publishing.
As Curt Johnson and Diane Kruchkow have stated, the 1960s small press
“provided an environment…in which one could discover literature first-hand.”

In recognition of SHARP’s 2007 theme, “Open the Book, Open the Mind,” this
panel seeks to explore how this discovery took place for readers of these
publications by examining the role of different printing technologies and
production methods employed during this “revolution” and how they affected
the target audience for these publications. Exactly what were the production
methods used under the banner of the Mimeo Revolution and how did they
differ from each other and from publications of earlier eras? What, if any,
divergences were seen in the traditional audience for literary work produced
by little magazines and small presses?  How did this grassroots effort
differentiate itself from the more conservative academic quarterlies and
commercial publishers? The panel encourages papers that take a historical
look at literary publishing with a focus on the publication and production
of these works, rather than a critique of the work within, or how the styles
of writing originating during this time affected the publication of that
work. Papers may examine individual presses or magazines or take a wider
view of the era.
Send a one page abstract and brief CV by November 20, 2006, to Christopher
Harter (charter@uiuc.edu).

Jail conditions for Canadian aboriginals a 'disgrace': ombudsman

Monday, October 16, 2006
CBC News

http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2006/10/16/native-prisoners.html

Aboriginal offenders are routinely discriminated against by the
corrections system and are far less likely to get parole or be
rehabilitated by their experiences in jail, the ombudsman for federal
prisons says.

Releasing his annual report into conditions in federal prisons,
correctional investigator Howard Sapers said the challenges faced by
aboriginal people in Canadian jails amounts to "a national disgrace".

"Despite years of task force reports, internal reviews, national
strategies, partnership agreements and action plans, there has been no
measurable improvements in the conditions for aboriginal offenders
during the last 20 years," said Sapers at a news conference in Ottawa.

He said the overall incarceration rate for aboriginal Canadians was nine
times higher than for the population at large and the situation was even
worse for aboriginal women.

One in three inmates in federally-run women's prisons were aboriginal,
he said, with almost half of them in maximum security institutions.

Aboriginals often sent to maximum security prison

He said there was "routine overclassification" of native prisoners, who
were far more likely to be sent to maximum security prison than
offenders from other backgrounds.

"That means they [aboriginal offenders] often serve their sentences away
from family, community, their friends and elders," Sapers said, "They
are sent into segregation more often … severely limiting access to
rehabilitative programs and services that are intended to prepare them
for their release."

Parole is routinely denied or revoked, often on technical grounds, he said.

Sapers called on the federal government to address the situation
urgently with new programs, more resources and consultations with
aboriginal leaders and communities.

Angus Toulouse, of the Ontario Regional Council of the Assembly of First
Nations,  said poverty, inadequate educational and employment
opportunities, alcoholism and domestic abuse were among the reasons for
overrepresentation.

"Where disadvantaged socio-economic factors lead to overrepresentation
of First Nations peoples in the criminal justice system, this is
systemic discrimination," said Toulouse.

Public Safety Minister Stockwell Day has said he will consider the
findings of Sapers's report but there is no evidence of systemic
discrimination against native offenders in the prison system.

The president of the Native Women's Association of Canada said the
alarming rise in the number of aboriginal women who are incarcerated
affects all Canadians.

"If this was the case for non-aboriginal people, I'm almost certain that
Canadians would react and demand that something be done," said Beverly
Jacobs.

'Cross' Shows Jesus As Being a Black Man

http://apnews1.iwon.com//article/20061025/D8KVQNBO0.html

Oct 25, 2:23 PM (ET)

By SANDY COHEN

(AP) This undated photo released by Nu-Lite Entertainment shows Jean
Claude LaMarre, who wrote, directed...

http://apnews1.iwon.com/image/20061025/FILM_BLACK_JESUS.sff_LA302_20061025141922.html?date=20061025&docid=D8KVQNBO0

LOS ANGELES (AP) - It's a familiar image for millions of Christians:
Jesus Christ, with a crown of thorns, hanging from the cross. What color
is he? In a controversial new film opening Friday, he is black.

"Color of the Cross" tells a traditional story, focusing on the last 48
hours of his life as told in the Gospels. In this version, though, race
contributes to his persecution.

It is the first representation in the history of American cinema of
Jesus as a black man.

"It's very important because (the film) is going to provide an image of
Jesus for African-Americans that is no longer under the control of
whites," says Stephenson Humphries-Brooks, an associate professor of
religious studies at New York's Hamilton College and author of
"Cinematic Savior: Hollywood's Making of the American Christ."

What Jesus looked like has long been debated by theologians around the
world. Different cultures have imagined him in different ways, says
Stephen Prothero, chairman of the religion department at Boston
University. In Japan, Jesus looks Japanese. In Africa, he is black. But
in America he is almost always white, like the fair-haired savior
painted by Leonardo Da Vinci in "The Last Supper" in 1495.

While some black churches have images of a black Jesus behind the altar
and others have claimed Christ was black, Prothero says "none of those
arguments or images have filtered much into the mainstream."

Filmmaker Jean Claude LaMarre set out to change that with "Color of the
Cross." LaMarre, who plays Jesus, wrote, directed and financed the film.
It will open in 30 theaters in predominantly black neighborhoods.

"Black people in this country are the only race of people who worship a
god outside their own image," says LaMarre, 38, adding that showing
Christ as a black man is "the most poignant way to deal with the issue
of race in this country because it goes to the heart of how we look at
the world."

It also provides a positive image of blacks, something that's been scant
in the U.S., says the Rev. Cecil "Chip" Murray, longtime leader of
L.A.'s First African Methodist Episcopal Church and a producer of the film.


"It could be revolutionary because, for four centuries in our nation,
blacks have been at the lowest end of the stratum," he says. "I think it
will traumatize the United States more than it will foreign nations who,
to some extent, don't have a centuries-old concept of equating black
with negativity."

Humphries-Brooks agrees. Other countries are likely to view the film "in
a more detached manner," he says, "because of the way (they) see our
race-relations problem."

Why does race matter in the story of Christ?

"Jesus isn't in the hands of historians," Prothero says. "What we have
now is our own debate and, in that debate, race has to be a factor
because race is a big predicament in American life."

Film is a powerful place to have the discussion, says Humphries-Brooks,
who calls the medium "one of the last places that is quasi-public for
the formation of values in America."

"Artistic and aesthetic views are as important in developing religious
values as the words we speak. Everybody goes to the movies. Not
everybody goes to the same church."

Filmmaker LaMarre thinks the film can only have a positive effect.

"The message is that color, a colored Jesus Christ, doesn't matter," he
says. "That's why the movie is important. When you have one prevailing
image out there, it suggests color does matter."

So nice to see you mention Leonard Gonterek's name on the poetry =20

was there from 86-92. For people like myself who were "too street =20
poet for the academics, and allegedly too academic for the street =20

I've always found this topic to be really interesting. There are two issues at play here that I think get undue attention: 1.) arguing over the race
of Jesus of Nazareth is to project the socially constructed ideas of race from our era into an era when the ideas of race were completely different.
So to say that Jesus was white or Jesus was black or Jesus was Asian is entirely anachronistic. 2.) From a theological perspective, the issue that the
article posted brings up, that people worship G-d in their own image, well, that's a little strange, isn't it, when the basic idea is that we were
created in H-s image? I mean, really when it comes right down to it, all the people in the world probably look nothing like G-d, but if you took the
common characteristics of all of us, then you'd get that "image of the divine" that we were created in, right? So focussing on Jesus's race is really
only a way of further distancing your imagge of god from what he actually looks like, since it's a way of enforcing difference rather than likeness.
3.) which is not to say that Black folks aren't completely right to point out that a blond haired blue eyed jesus is pretty fucking dumb, just saying
maybe the muslims got it right when they decreed there would be no images of God or The Prophet. It makes a lot more sense from a practical view. If
nobody has an idea what they look like, then they really could look like everybody. everybody with a y chromosome at least.

Good question. I think that the small press "revolution" is so  important to poetry. Many people would not be read if it weren't for  these small presses--and now we have moved on to online journals, which  I disapproved of at first, but now have a great deal of respect and  affection for these sources of new poets and poetry.

and while it honors the dead, it also refuses to separate them from the
things with which they lived. ... This is a brave book, one that records
enormous loss, but refuses to look away from events that continue to
unfold."

Small Press Trafffic is pleased to present a reading by

Douglas Kearney & Prageeta Sharma

Friday, November 3, 2006 at 7:30 p.m.

Douglas Kearney joins us in celebration of his first collection, Fear, Some,
just out from Red Hen Press. He has been a featured performer at venues across
the country, including the New York Public Theater, the Orpheum in Minneapolis
and the World Stage in Los Angeles. He has exhibited InJury, a series
combining poetry, image and design, at the 2005 Afro-Geek Conference at UC
Santa Barbara. Kearney is the editor of Cave Canem IX, an anthology of poetry
by African American poets. Kearney joins us from Los Angeles.


Prageeta Sharma’s books include Bliss To Fill (Subpress, 2000) and The Opening
Question (Fence, 2004), of which Kathleen Ossip has said: “One of the current
technologies that Sharma makes the most of is a relaxed surrealism. Any poet
sensitive to the countless stimuli of contemporary life and smart enough to
cope with the complete human range of emotions and blessed with a capacious
imagination will find realism a pretty paltry implement. Sharma's variant has
a sweet gravity.”


Unless otherwise noted, events are $5-10, sliding scale, free to current SPT
members and CCA faculty, staff, and students.

Unless otherwise noted, our events are presented in Timken Lecture Hall,
California College of the Arts 1111 Eighth Street, San Francisco (just off the
intersection of 16th & Wisconsin)

Christine Hamm is reading from her new book, The Transparent Dinner, at 3:00 at the Ear
Inn this Saturday, November 4.
Readers: Christine Hamm, Thomas March, Juliet Patterson
326 Spring Street (west of Greenwich Street)
New York City
FREE

Subway: C/E to Spring Street; 1/9 to Canal Street; N/R to Prince Street


Here's a sample of one of Christine's poems:

Animal Husbandry

The dog tells me that's he leaving me, that he no longer likes sticking his nose in my
crotch. This last week he has been slipping his leash after I fall asleep and sucking
cock in the backroom at Woody's. He tells me about the glory holes in the bathroom of the
New York Public Library. I tell him he's lying, that dogs aren't allowed in the library.
I'm having trouble breathing. I sit down on the edge of the bed. I shout, what, so women
aren't good enough for you anymore! I remind him of our first date, how he tied me up and
we cried all night. Never before had I been threatened with such tenderness, such
sincerity. You can't fake that! I scream. I am sobbing. I am not a woman if my dog
doesn't want me. I'm a question mark in a skirt.

The dog has his sad puppy-dog eyes on. I've seen him practice this look in the mirror. He
asks me not to hate him. He rolls his eyes and whines.

I know that he's already picturing himself out on a walk, leaving me here alone in a room
full of condoms and chew toys, some man's hand on his leash. I wonder if it's my scent
that he finds so vile. He rests his chin on his crossed paws. It's not that you're fat,
he tells me. There's a gland near the base of the skull that regulates it-- this desire,
this thing, for bones.

Dear Buffalo Poetics List:


The University of California Press  is pleased to announce the publication of:

The Holy Forest: Collected Poems of Robin Blaser, Revised and Expanded Edition.

Robin Blaser is Professor Emeritus at Simon Fraser University. Among
his many books are _The Fire: Collected Essays of Robin Blaser _(UC
Press), _Pell Mell, _and _Syntax_. Miriam Nichols is College
Professor at University College of the Fraser Valley and editor of
_Even on Sunday: Essays, Readings, and Archival Materials on the
Poetry and Poetics of Robin Blaser._

http://go.ucpress.edu/BlaserForest

"In his exquisite articulations of the flowers of associational
thinking, Robin Blaser has turned knowledge into nowledge, the 'wild
logos' of the cosmic companionship of the real."-Charles Bernstein,
author of _Republics of Reality: 1975-1995_


Robin Blaser, one of the key North American poets of the postwar
period, emerged from the "Berkeley Renaissance" of the 1940s and
1950s as a central figure in that burgeoning literary scene. _The
Holy Forest, _now spanning five decades, is Blaser's highly acclaimed
lifelong serial poem. This long-awaited revised and expanded edition
includes numerous published volumes of verse, the ongoing
"Image-Nation" and "Truth Is Laughter" series, and new work from 1994
to 2004. Blaser's passion for world making draws inspiration from the
major poets and philosophers of our time-from friends and peers such
as Robert Duncan, Jack Spicer, Charles Olson, Charles Bernstein, and
Steve McCaffery to virtual companions in thought such as Hannah
Arendt, Maurice Merleau-Ponty, Michel Foucault, and Jacques Derrida,
among others. This comprehensive compilation of Blaser's prophetic
meditations on the histories, theories, emotions, experiments, and
countermemories of the late twentieth century will stand as the
definitive collection of his unique and luminous poetic oeuvre.

Backing up Peter Quartermain's praise here of some weeks back, I also
strongly recommend, Fires, Robin Blaser's book of collected essays, also
from UC Press. A delightful one. Writing with intelligence and passion and a
genuine sense of revelation for the currents between Spicer, Duncan and the
outward(word) networks of Black Mountain, Olson, Creeley et al.
A writing in which the 'being' of the act of writing is constantly at stake
- and that is to imply the joys of discovery (risk & adventure) - and not,
say, another person's melodrama, or, conversely, an atonal, academic
defense.

As they say - and it's a big book - couldn't put it down.

Subject: Post-Doctoral Fellowship at Penn State
CC: Debbie McMurtrie , &quot;Dr. Keith B. Wilson&quot;
Dear Colleagues:
        As you may be aware, the Africana Research Center, in conjunction with the College of Liberal Arts and the Office of the Provost, and with the help of the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation has instituted a two-part initiative to enrich the diversity of scholarship at Penn State.  If you or someone you know will complete their Ph.D. by the beginning of next academic year, or has have completed their Ph.D. within the past two academic years, this may be an exciting opportunity.
        The Emerging Scholars Speakers Series invites talented scholars who conduct research on the African Diaspora to share their research with the Penn State community.  Speakers will be early career scholars, meaning that they will either finish their degree within the year or have received it within the past two years.        The second part of the initiative draws on the pool of invited speakers.  From the speakers, a number of early career scholars will be offered positions as Africana Research Post-Doctoral Fellows.  Post-doctoral Fellows will spend a year in residence at Penn State, attend community events, and participate in professional development workshops.  Post-Doctoral Fellows will have no teaching and no administrative responsibilities.
        The goal of both initiatives is to create at a world-class community of researchers interested in the African Diaspora here at Penn State, and to create opportunities for departments within Liberal Arts to house world-class emerging scholars.
        Last year, we admitted three Post-Doctoral Fellows.  For this year, we would love to see more applicants (and re-applicants).
        If you or someone you know is interested, please email the following materials to Debra McMurtrie (dvb7@psu.edu) by November 27th.  If you have any questions, please contact me, Phil Goff (contact information below). We look forward to hearing from many of you.
The following materials must be supplied in a successful application:
1. A letter of application - no more than 500 words2. An updated curriculum vita3. A 500-word essay about how a black intellectual community has been important in your development as a scholar and how you envision community factoring in your career.4. One or two writing samples, the first from your dissertation. If you submit one sample, it should be a single chapter. If you submit two, the combined length should not exceed 50 pages.5. At least one letter of recommendation (from your dissertation advisor. Recommendations may be sent separately from the application packet).
Sincerely,

Brad Will was a friend: a friend of poetry, of the environment, of free
speech and media, of justice.  (He was a fearless champion of the community
pocket gardens across Manhattan=B9s Lower East Side, as they came under siege
in the Giuliani Administration.  He also interviewed many poets on his show
for the microradio station, Steal This Radio.)  This is sad news.  Check ou=

>=20
> "Color of the Cross" tells a traditional story, focusing on the last 48

> contributes to his persecution.
>=20
> It is the first representation in the history of American cinema of

>=20
> "It's very important because (the film) is going to provide an image of

> whites," says Stephenson Humphries-Brooks, an associate professor of
> religious studies at New York's Hamilton College and author of
> "Cinematic Savior: Hollywood's Making of the American Christ."
>=20
> What Jesus looked like has long been debated by theologians around the
> world. Different cultures have imagined him in different ways, says
> Stephen Prothero, chairman of the religion department at Boston
> University. In Japan, Jesus looks Japanese. In Africa, he is black. But
> in America he is almost always white, like the fair-haired savior
> painted by Leonardo Da Vinci in "The Last Supper" in 1495.
>=20
> While some black churches have images of a black Jesus behind the altar
> and others have claimed Christ was black, Prothero says "none of those
> arguments or images have filtered much into the mainstream."
>=20
> Filmmaker Jean Claude LaMarre set out to change that with "Color of the
> Cross." LaMarre, who plays Jesus, wrote, directed and financed the film.
> It will open in 30 theaters in predominantly black neighborhoods.
>=20
> "Black people in this country are the only race of people who worship a
> god outside their own image," says LaMarre, 38, adding that showing
> Christ as a black man is "the most poignant way to deal with the issue
> of race in this country because it goes to the heart of how we look at

i had written a paper two years ago for an ACLA panel on "THe Use
Value of the Avant-garde" in which i used Brad Will's writing from
Goiania, Brazil, as an instance of "avant-garde" documentary news
coverage.  I was so shocked to hear his name on the news Saturday
morning.  He was a good friend of good friends, and i feel as if by
writing about his writing i got to know him too.  I am very sad and
am happy to sign the petition and pass it on.  deaths like this in
the poetry community (like that of Ramez Qureshi some years ago) make
me feel that this listserv can be, in fact, a very intimate space
where we come to know and depend on each other and feel it when the
fabric has been torn... love to all, md

Content-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable

      Palm Press is pleased to announce publication of LANGQUAGE MAKES =
PLASTIC OF THE BODY by Andrew Choate.

      The first book-length work by this South Carolinian / Southern =
Californian writer collects songs, essays, poetry, brief prose stories =
and documents from his unusual epistolary archive. Choate combines close =
attention to graphic detail - from page design to the evocativity of =
intentional misspelling - with a heightened focus on the influence of =
sonic texture over a word's migration between the page and the person. A =
wry but contagious humor underlies each piece. Includes "Laser Pointers =
Put the Demon in Demonstrate." Accompanying each book is a CD featuring =
musical renditions and other sonic performances of the work, plus 18 =
CD-exclusive pieces.=20

      "His world is surrounded by a saturn's ring of theatrical =
meowing."=20

      LANGQUAGE MAKES PLASTIC OF THE BODY, Andrew Choate's wicked wild =
rumpus in the materiality of language, is a palimpsest-primer for mock =
engagement of meaning perceived through the senses. Choate's poetry and =
visual/aural compositions resist easy definition as they critique the =
singularly homo-erectus-cum-sapien penchant for Story, translate the =
City of Angels' cuneiform graffiti and pack more linguistic sonic booms =
into the pages and accompanying audio tracks than paper and plastic =
should rightly hold.  Check it out: www.palmpress.org=20
    =20

This book is the product of collaboration and collective design, =
production and engineering by the people of Palm Press, Haoyan of =
America, Pampermaster Studio and many individuals in California and =
elsewhere.=20

Stapled, 40 pages with CD.=20
$15.00=20

A while back I anjounced on several lists Stet:=20
Selected Poems of Jos=E9 Kozer. There wasn't a=20
squeal of interest on this list, tho the much=20
smaller UK Poets list produced 5 orders in a day.=20
So I figure I must have done something wrong.

Kozer is without question the most important=20
living Cuban poet, which is why a selected poems=20
was the first book by a living exile published in=20
Cuba. He's also one of the leading lights of the=20
neobarroco, the dominant movement in Latin=20
American poetry of the last 20 years. The=20
neobarroco should be of especial interest to=20
poets on a University of Buffalo list, and it's=20
almost unknown in the English-speaking world.

Five of the translations, by yours truly, are on=20
the web, at=20
http://jacketmagazine.com/18/kozer.html and=20
http://www.shearsman.com/pages/magazine/back_issues/shearsman65_66/kozer.htm=
l.=20
There are a lot more: the book is 222 pages, bilingual.
Cover price is $20.00, but I discount to the=20
list, so $16 plus $3 shipping in the US.

Here's what Jerry Rothenberg says about the book:

"The poetry of Kozer, in this beautifully=20
selected & translated edition, moves from a=20
particular person & place (Cuban, Jewish, caught=20
between home & exile) into a tangle of locations=20
& perceptions that gives his poetry a nearly epic=20
status. While the work has an avant-garde=20
(=93neobaroque=94) foundation =96 & it does =96 it=92s the=20
humanity of the writing (passionate & comic by=20
turns & always precisely referential) that=20
predicts its lasting greatness. A resident of=20
America & of the world, Jos=E9 Kozer is a poet who=20
works at full throttle, gives us thereby what=20
poetry has never done before & what it has always done."

Those interested in the book, please b/c and we can arrange the details.

In a couple of weeks, I'm teaching Mehmedinovic's _Sarajevo Blues_ and I'm looking for any general background material I could present to college freshman to familiarize them with the context of the war.  Please backchannel suggestions for readings (for the students or any best reserved for me but which I may have missed).

Thanks in advance,

Patrick

The Electronic Literature Collection, Volume One

Hayles, Nick Montfort, Scott Rettberg, and Stephanie Strickland, is an
anthology of 60 eclectic works of electronic literature, published

paying any licensing fees. The Collection will be free for individuals.

The 60 works included in the Electronic Literature Collection present a
broad overview of the field of electronic literature, including selected
works in new media forms such as hypertext fiction, kinetic poetry,
generative and combinatory forms, network writing, codework, 3D, and
narrative animations. Contributors include authors and artists from Brazil,
the USA, Canada, the UK, France, Germany, and Australia. Each work is framed
with brief editorial and author descriptions, and tagged with descriptive
keywords. The CD-ROM of the Collection runs on both Macintosh and Windows
platforms and is published in a case appropriate for library processing,
marking, and distribution. Free copies of the CD-ROM can be requested from
The Electronic Literature Organization.

University Press, 2007).

Ah, the lamest of all postmodern critiques: "OMG IT'S AN 'ISM' HOW
CORNY IT CAN'T BE TRUE !"

Not so, honey. Your description of the Colombian people could have
been lifted from a late 19th century text of some sort (replacing, of
course, "Colombian" with, say, the generic "Oriental").

They "SPEAK SOFTLY", they speak only in "RIDDLES"; their lives are
shaped by "POEMS" of -- what? -- "EVASION" or something? Ooo, how
exotic; what mystique! Haha, yeah, and they also have gumdrop houses
and address all Americans "meesta, meesta."

Open doors of simile . . . For chrissakes, you're a joke.

phil--i think you're a little harsh in your messaging, but i think the
undercurrent is true.

making generalizations about any "people" or culture is incredibly
dangerous, moreso if they are romantic generalizations.

the difficulty in describing what we see never goes away; however, there are
"better" methods--this has been the struggle in anthropology since, oh,
forever.  i've done a lot of work in chicana studies--and some of
these'flattering" or "romantic' generalizations are just as harmful as their
more maleviolent counterparts.  we're all aware of the madonna/whore
dichotomy, and, in the case of chicanas, one ideal their work rallies
against is just that: the idea that women are most valuable as mothers, or
saints, and that any type of self-assertion makes one undesirable....we
could talk about this for days.

in the case of what heidi wrote--the vagueness, the generalities--it echoes,
for me and my experience, the labeling of chicana lit as 'magical realism",
one way to say something"nice" while simaltaneously undercutting its
validity.

i am sure i've said it before, but as poets, our "job" is to be precise,
specific, and above all else, as "true" as possible.

Hi steve,

the book looks pretty amazing from the website. I just wanted to drop you a note to let you know i noticed a typo in brian stefans' blurb. The word "possesses" is misspelled.

can't wait to get my hands on a copy, best of luck with the launch.

yrs,
Jason

Mutabilities by Brenda Hammack

after paintings by Remedios Varo

I. Mimesis | II. Discovery of a Mutant Geologist | III. Unexpected Visit
IV. The Useless Science or the Alchemist | V. Creation of the Birds

Brenda Hammack's work has appeared in The Sow's Ear Poetry Review, Tar
Wolf Review, Heliotrope, The Hurricane Review, The North Carolina Literary
Review, The Laurel Review, and various other journals. She teaches
Victorian literature, children's literature, and an interdisciplinary
course on images of women at Fayetteville State University.

Remedios Varo, an expatriate painter of Spanish origin, living in France
and, then, Mexico, absorbed the mystical traditions of many cultures,
transmuting them into celestial spindrift (i.e. noctilucent objects that
orbited the heads of jugglers, artists, and otherwordly scholars in oil on
masonite). Varo was greatly influenced by the French surrealists,
including Andre Breton, as well as by occult philosophers (Gurdjieff,
Blavatsky, Ouspensky). Her mutabilities are science filtered through
alembic, natural law as translated by tarot. Varo was born in Angles in
1910; she died in Mexico City in 1963.
