Subject:      Truck September: "TimeWaveZero"
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=windows-1252
Content-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable

Dear all,

first of all, I want to thank David Howard for driving Truck last August.

With a little bit of delay and suffering a severe case of holiday blues
(and hernia), I'm starting this month's Truck.

I would like to dedicate September to TimeWaveZero.


In 2006 I started with the Antistresspoweet the idea to start a magazine
around the idea TimeWaveZero. Due to different problems it didn't start
eventually.


All in all for me 9/11 was a sort of TimeWaveZero from which a new decade,
era, time frame started.


It would be my idea now to work around this idea TimeWaveZero, also
incorporating the works that were mailed to us in 2006 and make a sort of
dialogue between the past, present and future.


TimeWaveZero?


The emphasis would be on the poet within the international community, the
poet as the catalyst to change the world, the peace-bringer, the conscience
of society, but also on time and how the poet/artist is experiencing time.

Starting from the idea of experiencing the self within the vacuum of
nothingness, of the zero of the beginning of things.

The zero becoming a 360 degree circle where the following idea applies:

"The Circle. How does this shape, this spatial form, enter consciousness;
how does it take on meaning; how does it come to be divided into 360 units;
and how it is used as a measurement standard to capture the times of our
lives?" Noel Tyl


Schroedingers' cat dilemma should be considered also within this, is
life/the world/our surroundings waves or particles? How do we consider
ourselves within this post 9/11 world?

The theories which research the Butterfly Effect, the circle as centre of
consciousness but also Aboriginal Dreamtime, Zeropointenergy
(Heisenberg/Planck/quantumphysics). should be taken into consideration when
thinking about TimeWaveZero and it's consequences.

Some of the theories concerning TimeWaveZero pointed at December 21st 2012
as a moment of "End of Time" or "Beginning of a new era" again. The truth
lies in another part of the world perhaps, not the Mayan conundrum but the
Arab Spring could point out the end of an era and start of a new timeframe.
The starting point of what is yet to come=85.



More information on other ideas/theories about TimeWaveZero can be found
here:


http://users.lycaeum.org/~sputnik/mckenna/TZandL.html


http://www.hermetic.ch/frt/math_twz.htm


You can contribute to this month's Truck, by sending your work via e-mail
to philip (dot) meersman (at) gmail (dot) com

Please put "Truck - TimeWaveZero" in the subject line and add a short 3
lines bio at the end.

Dear friends,

We've got some news, and want to share it with you directly. Please see
the press release below. Feel free to spread the word, publish the
release, and/or contact me with any questions you may have.

Best wishes from Amsterdam,
Megan



FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
September 5, 2013 - Amsterdam, the Netherlands

A journal has an intermission

Versal released our 11th issue in May to critical acclaim
<http://www.thereviewreview.net/reviews/experimental-literary-international-journal-pushes-b>.
Our 11th issue means we've been on the scene for 11 amazing years,
curating the best prose, poetry, and art from practitioners around the
world, for an international audience.

With that many years under our belt, we've seen and learned a lot. The
literary landscape has changed drastically since we published our first
issue back in 2002.

We've changed as well.


Where we're going

We're eager to improve the way we do things--logistically and
conceptually. This means retiring old processes and moving over to
better ways of running a journal and exploring projects we've had on the
backburner.

To give ourselves breathing room for these exciting new developments
we've decided to go on a sabbatical of sorts, pausing the release of the
next issue of Versal and therefore its reading period. We'll make an
announcement as soon as we're ready to begin reading for issue 12.

All of our subscribers will receive an email detailing options regarding
their subscriptions.


What to expect this year

Though we're not producing an issue right now, we are continuing to put
on events in Amsterdam and elsewhere. Watch our Twitter
<https://twitter.com/versaljournal> and Facebook
<https://www.facebook.com/versaljournal> page for news, including
announcements regarding This is Not a Reading Series and our Journal
Porn event in Seattle at AWP!

So, keep writing, creating, and keep in touch. We'll be back with Versal
12 recharged, rebooted, and better than ever.



Thanks!

The Versal Team

In 2010, I published my response to The Empire of Neomemory, in the
Worcester Review. My thoughts were first delivered during the Olson
Centennial in Worcester. With the English-language release of this important
work, I have just now reposted that response.

The new ebook from Argotist Ebooks is =E2=80=9CShow and Tell=E2=80=9D by Jo=
e Amato.
Description:
=E2=80=9CShow and Tell=E2=80=9D might properly be called a work of experime=
ntal sci-fi. It=E2=80=99s an unconventional amalgam of standard narrative, =
reportage, film criticism, poetry, cultural commentary, conceptual writing,=
 and science fiction, with an overlay of autobiographical detail that will =
likely be seen as such only by readers familiar with the author's other wor=
k. All told it=E2=80=99s a distinctively postmodern piece of writing that t=
akes some unusual turns even by postmodern standards. It's part of a collec=
tion of short fiction, in progress, tentatively entitled =E2=80=9CThe Heigh=
ts and Weights of Stars.=E2=80=9D

It's more important they lay open in the ocean

And whether or not we mount the red birds

Like beveled ornaments

Less sophisticate

The shifting tents are mutinous

New movement

Eats the grain each day, little by little

Even the noun eats acid

You are in a Roman place

But the year is out of order

Only the tent city stirs in the morning

Nothing more

In a few days, and thanks to the excellent work of Jeremy Hight and
Willis Gordon, we’ll have a new multimedia issue of //Unlikely Stories:
Episode IV//for your pleasure. For now, though, please delight in the
knowledge of three forthcoming events:

--
Saturday, September 14th
during the Elemore Morgan Jr. Fall Fest Art Walk
Acadiana Center for the Arts hosts

LE MOT / THE WORD
at 6:15 pm and 7:15 pm
in the James Devin Moncus Theater
101 W. Vermilion St., Lafayette, Louisiana

Featuring poetry readings in French, English, and German with Darrell
Bourque, Clare L. Martin, Elizabeth Burk, J. Bruce Fuller, Michael J.
Leblanc, Gerd Wuestemann and Brenda Cary.
--

I’m helping to organize this great set of two twenty-minute poetry
readings this Saturday night, at the Acadiana Center for the Arts in
downtown Lafayette, Louisiana. They’ll be during downtown Lafayette’s
monthly Art Walk — specifically, they’ll be during Lafayette’s September
Art Walk, which is always dedicated to the late, great area artist
Elemore Morgan, Jr. ( http://www.elemoremorgan.com/ ) If you come to
Lafayette occasionally, this Saturday will be the time — the visual art
museums and galleries will be pulling out great presentations, and we’ll
have an exciting and unique Acadian poetry show.

Then we’ll hop into a plane’s cargo bay for:

--
&UNLIKELY: a multimedia happening
at the Mercury Café
Friday, September 27, 8pm
2199 California St, Denver, Colorado

featuring j/j hastain, Tom Bradley, Tod Thilleman, Frankie Metro,
Lindsey Thomas, Jeffrey Spahr-Summers, and your devotedly ennyeux host,
Jonathan Penton
--
and an Unlikely Book Release
of two new full-color books: We’ll See Who Seduces Whom by David Aronson
and Tom Bradley and pleth by j/j hastain and Marthe Reed
starring Marthe Reed, j/j hastain, and Tom Bradley

at Innisfree Poetry
Saturday, September 28th, 5pm
1203 13th Street, Boulder, Colorado
--

Unlikely staffers Frankie Metro, Lindsey Thomas, and myself will be
descending, along with a host of extremely Unlikely writers and artists,
on the University of Colorado Boulder for the &NOW Festival (
http://www.andnowfestival.com/ ) of experimental fiction and literature!
We’ll be stirring up all kinds of nasty trouble, including our Denver
night of visuals, poems, and vocalizations. On the night of Friday the
27th, we’ll be at the Mercury Café with j/j hastain, Tom Bradley, Tod
Thilleman, and Jeffrey Spahr-Summers, and maybe if we are very very
quiet and careful Yuriy Tarnawsky and Marc Vincenz will make it there!
We’ll see!

On Saturday evening, the party will culminate at Innisfree Poetry
Bookstore and Café with the release of two fantastic books, pleth and
We’ll See Who Seduces Whom. Those books will be available from Unlikely
Books soon, so if you can’t make it to &NOW, you should get ready to buy
them, instead! They will make you happy in your soul.

See you in the funny papers, at least the ones that get filed with
reader opinions,
–

The twentieth anniversary year might be winding down, but that doesn't mean
we over at above/ground press (really, its just me) are doing any less.
2013 has been one of the most productive publishing years the press has
seen, producing (so far) twenty-three chapbooks, six broadsheets, and two
issues of The Peter F Yacht Club! Forthcoming titles for 2013 include new
works by Rae Armantrout and Hailey Higdon, and a 2014 title by Hugh Thomas
(to launch at The Factory Reading Series in February), plus a whole ton of
other material we haven't even decided on yet.

2014 annual subscriptions are now available: $50 (in the United States,
$50 US; $75 international) for everything above/ground press makes from
now (that is, when you subscribe) until the end of 2014.

Anyone who subscribes before November 1st will also receive the last
above/ground press package of 2013, including those exciting new titles by
Rae Armantrout and Hailey Higdon (plus whatever else the press happens to
produce before the turn of the new year).

Friends, colleagues, supporters, heroes of mine,



I have two weeks to raise funds for my film/media/literature/music project:
Red Dust. The urgency? Dad is 91 years old. My mother, his wife of 62 years
took her journey last winter and in looking for some purpose in life, he
finally agreed to allow me to document his firsthand oral history of the
Dust Bowl, the Great Depression and his leaving for WWII service. At 91, he
actually worked during the era specific, as a migrant worked and day
laborer in cotton fields at a penny a pound. This is not secondhand
investigation or theory, this is the oral history and narrative of the day.
He is a vital source, who has never enjoyed attention, or cameras, and is
tremendous on film.



Additionally, he was so moved by the climate change, by the dust bowl that
preceded it (rarely spoken of) and by his parents=92 resiliency and ability
to change, grown and shift (born in 1878 and 1882), and by his own
remarkable journey, he spent his career following WWII as an environmental
protection scientist creating a pathway for sustainability and preservation
that was rarely achieved in the Native community in his era. He is a
national bronze medalist in the sciences and his work is still cited at the
UN, though he retired thirty years ago at the normal age of retirement.



He was raised with traditional knowledge, his mother was, literally, a
healer and midwife, and he incorporated it throughout his career. He is a
terrific storyteller and thinker and has much to offer to the discussion of
resiliency and as a chronicler of the times Native experience has sadly
been nearly omitted from though the best Lange portraits were of Cherokee
migrant (cotton & pea) workers. Voiceless, they are our vision of that day.



As my parents, and theirs, have always been the crux of my work dedicated
to labor, to the environment, to preservation and protection of sites and
tradition, to those held in institutions, to those suffering deprivation,
to my active engagement in the world, and as my father taught us to
withstand full-blown schizophrenia my mother suffered throughout our
childhood, he is, for me, and many others, a real guidepost of insight into
the philosophy of resilience, of change, of reason and his words and
presence are worthy of preservation not only for the project but for all
future audience ahead.



The project goes to five states: North Carolina, Oklahoma, Colorado, New
Mexico, and Texas (Arkansas, if we can get there, too) to visit each site
the family lived while moving for work in the fields following the
longstanding tradition of agricultural tradition, all along having their
own traditionally cultivated corn, squash, and beans planted at each site
they worked for their own food. This is significant in a vast number of
ways and the film delivers this and more. We are also set to interview the
few remaining survivors he knows along the way and other Native elders, and
Roxanne Dunbar-Ortiz has agreed to be interviewed and we are inviting
Carter Revard, as well, as they have been, up to this point, the premier
people in the Dust Bowl conversation, yet no one has a film with oral
history involving a firsthand survivor who was old enough to be in the
labor force at its onset.



Please help me make this film.



I am already writing the books=92 contents and have been at work on this fo=
r
several years; while shooting I have access to him dialing and this will
surely speed that process along. We plan to begin shooting in three weeks,
while the weather holds and before it freezes as he cannot tolerate triple
digits or below freezing much at all at 91. I need your help now as our
project time for fundraising ends in a couple of weeks. Thus far, I have
used my Facebook pages wholly to fundraise and have $5000 plus in hand, 25%
of the amount we need to pay the crew and pay for the location costs and
camera. We are not making any money in this campaign. It is all directly
related to costs. With two weeks left and three from our start date, I must
reach out to you and ask you to contribute what you can, I have perks at
all levels and need sponsorship across the board. Ask three to ten people
to match you immediately and please speak to potential larger funders to
ask them to make a plea to their contacts and to consider coming in at the
$2500 to $5000 level whereas they receive credit as producers of the film.
A few of these and we would be solvent. If any entity is in your reach
please go to them as well and ask for contributing support.



This is completely tax-deductible and hosted by an agency that already
stipends a few Native writer/artists every year under their fellowship
program.



I do not have time to pursue a grant as an individual as we need to shoot
now while Dad is coherent (sharp as a tack) and can get around. He lost his
sight completely when Mom died this year, is deaf in one ear and hard of
hearing in the other from the war, and is a stroke and heart attack victim
already, so we need to get to this while he is able, able minded and able
bodied to get to the sites and do the work it takes to create a worthy film
on the times and what this means today.



I have a dream team of all Native/Native descent film crew: Royce Sharp
(Osage), Tvli Jacob (Creek), Shane Brown (Cherokee) and have a terrific
editor as well, Vinnie Hogan (who helped with the pitch reel you can watch
on the site). I want to pay them scale and treat them right and pay their
travel and lodging and the camera and thus this project campaign is
necessary for this.



Please investigate the site, please donate today, as much as you can, I
really need your help and please speak to others who can help, who need tax
write offs and care about oral history from a real source. This is
significant work and I need you in the project. I welcome you to join us in
this historic movement and in the production of what is sure to be a great
documentary.



Please watch this reel and please help me reach my goal:



http://www.usaprojects.org/project/red_dust_a_mixed_blood_dust_bowl_childho=
od



Please blog, tweet, and motivate the project as without your help, I won=92=
t
have the money to pay the crew and location costs. Dad is on an extremely
limited income (having retired at the amount of pension thirty years ago).
I support several of my grandkids and my fulltime university salary is
$40,000 gross (and cannot deduct the grandkids as they live with their
father, a single parent of four). So, there really is no money on the side
for anything. I need support to make this happen, while there is time.
Please help.



Sgido, hawa, I thank you!

Perhaps if I'd started earlier, & achieved what has thus far been
achieved=9780 books in total, covering a range of media & with an impressiv=
e
list of creators=97I might still have the energy to continue. But I didn't,=
 &
I haven't; so, with sadness, I announce the last two books from
Otoliths.<http://www.lulu.com/spotlight/l_m_young>

*harry k stammer=92s* new book, *grounds*, is a sequel to his previous book=
 *
tents. *It continues to dig deeper into the realm of a homeless person=92s
mind as he/she lives in downtown Los Angeles. As Philip Primeau, of
PERSISTENCIA, said of *tents*, =93stammer mixes a sort of poetic cubism wit=
h
wordplay, startling typography, and a wide array of other adventurous
techniques with creative intensity rarely witnessed.=94 This book uses
imagery and meaning to describe the various illnesses that afflict the
homeless.





*The Codicils*

URL:

*The Codicils* is actually a number of new books, nine at least, collected
into a single brick, covering *Mark Young's* poetry from the four years
since the publication of *Pelican Dreaming: Poems 1959-2008*. It revisits
some familiar themes =97 Magritte, *geographies*, that peripatectic Postman=
 =97
but it also brings in a number of new streams & memes, & includes an essay
by the poet on the universality of the stochastic methodology that lies
behind his poetic canon.



The journal will continue on, & print copies of the three most recent
issues, twenty-eight to thirty, are now available from The Otoliths
Storefront <http://www.lulu.com/spotlight/l_m_young> where the full catalog
of Otoliths books & issues of the journal can also be found.

Joyce Carol Oates describes Daisy Fried=92s poetry as =93fluid and quicks=
ilver
as life seen close up. Here is an original voice: provocative, poignant, =
and
often very funny.=94 Fried is the author of three books of poetry, Women=92=
s
Poetry: Poems and Advice, My Brother is Getting Arrested Again, a finalis=
t
for the National Book Critics Circle Award, and She Didn=92t Mean to Do I=
t,
which won the Agnes Lynch Starrett Award. For her poetry, she=92s receive=
d
Guggenheim, Hodder, and Pew Fellowships, as well as a Pushcart Prize and =
the
Cohen Award from Ploughshares. Recent poems have been selected for Best
American Poetry 2013, and published in the London Review of Books, The
Nation, The New Republic, Poetry, American Poetry Review, and The Threepe=
nny
Review. She reviews books of poetry for The New York Times, Poetry, and T=
he
Threepenny Review, and won the Editors Award from Poetry for =93Sing,
God-Awful Muse,=94 an essay about reading Paradise Lost and breastfeeding=
.

Jay Parini has written that Kim Bridgford=92s =93work is rigorous and mem=
orable,
full of linguistic surprises and emotional twists that suggest, as she sa=
ys,
that there is an art in learning how to underscore.=94 Bridgford is the
director of the West Chester University Poetry Center and the West Cheste=
r
University Poetry Conference, the largest all-poetry writing conference i=
n
the United States. As editor of Mezzo Cammin, she was the founder of The
Mezzo Cammin Women Poets Timeline Project, which was launched at the
National Museum of Women in the Arts in Washington on March 27, 2010, and=

will eventually be the largest database of women poets in the world. She =
is
the author of seven books of poetry, most recently Bully Pulpit and Epiph=
anies.=20

Ron Silliman has commented on Laynie Browne=92s book Daily Sonnets that =93=
It=92s
a stunner and a delight. A pure dose of heady oxygen . . . an icon for th=
e
generation of poets who are about to show up.=94 Browne has published nin=
e
collections of poetry and two novels, most recently The Ivory Hour. Her
honors include the National Poetry Series Award, the Contemporary Poetry
Series Award, and two Gertrude Stein Awards for Innovative American Poetr=
y.
Since 2011 she has been a volunteer mentor for the Afghan Women=92s Writi=
ng
Project.

Avant-garde critic Vladimir Slender-Hedge remarked on Paul Siegell=92s bo=
ok
wild life rifle fire that =93we find DaDa dynamite and typographical tali=
smans
freshened by a poet whose native gifts imbue this exciting work with a wh=
ole
new sense of poetic object. Siegell=92s haptic heroism compels the reader=
 to
re-examine the basic elements of a language that we too often take for
granted, in the process creating an energetic and always surprising work =
of
both visual art and poetry.=94 Siegell is the author of three books of po=
etry.
He serves as a senior editor at Painted Bride Quarterly, and by day, is a=

copywriter at The Philadelphia Inquirer.

Poetry as Social Action:  27th September @ Auckland University

How do contemporary poets engage their multiple audiences? What is the
function of experiment in writing as a social act? How should we map the
cultural dimensions of eco-poetics, identity politics or non-normative
behaviours? Seven speakers address these and other questions in a series of
interactive panels and a public reading hosted by the NZ Electronic Poetry
Centre (*nzepc*) in conjunction with Australian poet Pam Brown=92s
Distinguished Visitor Award at the University of Auckland.

I thought you might be interested in my new poetry book, AMERICAN SONGBOOK,=
 just published by Ugly Duckling Presse in Brooklyn.

AMERICAN SONGBOOK is a poetic response to the grand sweep of recorded vocal=
 music in the 20th century. The poems are based on 75 recordings, with sing=
ers ranging from Bessie Smith to Tupac Shakur, and songs from a little-know=
n Lomax prison recording to the last No.1 pop hit in the century.

Here's a link to the book page<http://www.uglyducklingpresse.org/catalog/br=
owse/item/?pubID=3D236> at UDP. The book can be purchased directly from UDP=
 at a discount, and also from SPD<http://www.spdbooks.org/Producte/97819370=
27001/american-songbook.aspx> and Amazon.com<http://www.amazon.com/American=
-Songbook-Michael-Ruby/dp/1937027007/ref=3Dsr>.

Individual poems from the book have recently appeared online in BlazeVOX<ht=
tp://www.blazevox.org/BX%20Covers/BXspring13/Michael%20Ruby%20-%20Spring%20=
13.pdf>, Blue Light + Turntable<http://www.turntablebluelight.com/2012/10/m=

=0A=0A=A0=0A =0A=A0 =0A=A0 A 'new poetry' emerges from Syria's civil war =
=A0=0A=A0=0ALeigh Cuen=0ASeptember 8, 2013=0AAljazeera=0A=A0=0A"Today there=
 is literature coming out of Syria that we could have never even dreamed of=
 just a few years ago," Atrash says.Rather than relying on metaphors and al=
legorical images, these new poems rely on literal, visceral descriptions, w=
ith a newfound emphasis on a united Syrian identity instead of religious sy=
mbols.  =A0 =0A=A0 Ghada al-Atrash says the literature coming out of Syria =
today is starkly different than just a few years ago, ,  =A0 =0A=A0 Ghada a=
l-Atrash, a Syrian-Canadian writer and translator, has been studying Syrian=
 poetry for decades.=0AYet in all her years of work, she says she has never=
 encountered works of poetry such as the ones emerging today from the depth=
s of a Syria in the throes of an increasingly deadly civil war.=0A"Today th=
ere is literature coming out of Syria that we could have never even dreamed=
 of just a few years ago," Atrash says.=0ARather than relying on metaphors =
and allegorical images, these new poems rely on literal, visceral descripti=
ons, with a newfound emphasis on a united Syrian identity instead of religi=
ous symbols. For instance, a poem she translated by Najat Abdul Samad, call=
ed "When I am overcome by weakness", reads:=0A"I bandage my heart with the =
determination of that boy / they hit with an electric stick on his only kid=
ney until he urinated blood. / Yet he returned and walked in the next demon=
stration... / I bandage it with the outcry: 'Death and not humiliation.'"=
=0AAnother by Youssef Bou Yihea titled "I am a Syrian", declares: "My sect =
is the scent of my homeland, the soil after the rain, and my Syria is my on=
ly religion."=0A"A lot of poetry and beautiful lyrics are rising up from th=
e ashes in Syria," says expatriate Syrian writer Ghias al-Jundi, who is res=
ponsible for PEN International's research on attacks against free expressio=
n in the Middle East.=0A"There is a cultural side to the revolution, and it=
's brilliant."=0ANew literary tradition=0AIt's not just the content that is=
 new. Syrian poetry is also being spread through different channels. Instea=
d of being introduced at formal gatherings or readings, Syrian poets often =
debut their work at public demonstrations, or on social networking sites su=
ch as Facebook.=0AArtscape - Poets of Protest - Hala Mohammad: Waiting for =
Spring=0AMohja Kahf, an award-winning Syrian-American writer and associate =
professor of comparative literature at the University of Arkansas, wrote an=
 article in 2001 titled "The Silence of Contemporary Syrian Literature", in=
 which she argued that fear, government censorship, and repression were the=
 defining characteristics of Syrian writing.=0A"That has all changed now," =
Kahf says, thanks in part to the Internet and social media platforms. "A ne=
w Syrian identity and literary tradition are being formed around the events=
 of the last few years."=0APoetry is "playing a huge role in Syria right no=
w because the lyrics are part of demonstrations," says Jundi.=A0 "People ar=
e singing these verses together in the streets."=0APeaceful demonstrations =
have reduced in number and size as the violence has intensified, but they h=
ave not stopped altogether.=0AFacebook is one of the main channels that Atr=
ash uses to connect with her partners in Syria. She says she discovered two=
 poets from the city of Sweida - Youssef Bou Yihea and Najat Abdul Samad, w=
hose work is quoted above - through the social networking site.=0AAtrash co=
ntacted these writers and was granted permission to translate their works i=
nto English.=0A"I take their poems fresh, translate them, and share them th=
rough social media," she says. "It's not just me. Today there are a lot of =
people translating and spreading Syrian poems from the ground."=0ACivilians=
 in Syria and around the world are using social networks to share these new=
 poems without censorship. Kahf herself has served as the leader of about 2=
0 Facebook pages focusing on nonviolent components of the revolution.=0A"Th=
e young people in Syria today grew up as part of a global conversation," sa=
ys Kahf.=0AAlthough Atrash believes the revolution is rejuvenating Syrian p=
oetry, both in the Middle East and around the world, she says language barr=
iers between global readers and Syrian writers on the ground keep internati=
onal audiences from accessing many of these new works.=0AAnd it's not just =
language barriers hindering accessibility. The Internet is not accessible f=
or large swaths of the Syrian population, especially as the UN estimates be=
tween a quarter and a third of the country's people have been displaced. Ne=
vertheless, social media tools are among the only platforms for new Syrian =
writers to connect with each other, whether at home or in exile.=0AWhile th=
ese past two years have seen a flood of new Syrian writers, not all of Syri=
a's prominent poets participate in this digital sphere.=0A"People are waiti=
ng for opposition poems from Adunis," says Maram al-Masri, a Syrian poet ba=
sed in Paris, referring to Ali Ahmad Said Esber, one of Syria's greatest li=
ving poets.=0A"He does a little, but for me and for a lot of people, we fee=
l disappointed. It's not enough. We need the fathers of modern Syrian poetr=
y to speak out."=0ADangerous profession=0AYet with the country in the grips=
 of a two-year-long civil war that shows no sign of abating, Syrian poets -=
 and writers more generally - are in more danger today than ever before.=0A=
"Poets and writers are disappearing across the country," says Jundi. "Syria=
n writers are caught between a double danger: the regime and the Islamists.=
 It is a risk to write or utter a word."=0AMost of the poets I talk to knew=
 there was a risk of death, imprisonment or exile if you write the truth. A=
nd even if they flee, they can also be killed abroad.=0A- Syrian writer Ghi=
as al-Jundi=0APoet Ibrahim Qashoush was kidnapped and killed in July 2011. =
Two writers - Dia'a al-Abdulla and Tal al-Mallouhi - are still believed to =
be in prison without access to a lawyer. Writer Khaled Khalifa was attacked=
 in Damascus in May 2012 and his left hand was broken.=0A"Most of the poets=
 I talk to knew there was a risk of death, imprisonment or exile if you wri=
te the truth," says Jundi. "And even if they flee, they can also be killed =
abroad."=0AExpatriate Syrian poets have been intimidated: Masri, who recent=
ly published a book of poems titled Freedom, she comes naked, inspired by s=
ocial media images and posts from Syria, says she has received death threat=
s and had loved ones in Syria forced into hiding.=0A"It's not easy to enter=
 a Syrian jail," says Masri. "You don't know if you will ever come out."=0A=
Some writers take precautions, saving lyrics under different names in case =
police search them or their homes, or propagating their poems anonymously. =
In such an atmosphere, few individual poets of this new style have risen to=
 fame.=0ABut although Syrian writers are still in grave danger, fear no lon=
ger controls their work. Violence is so pervasive in Syria that silence is =
no longer seen as a road to safety.=0ABefore 2011, even the popular traditi=
on of public poetry readings were controlled by government censorship. Now =
Syrian writers are defying these restrictions. Newly empowered by their pas=
sionate audiences, some Syrian poets are holding nothing back.=0A"We have b=
roken the old phantom of fear," Masri says.=0AJonathan Elkhoury assisted wi=

Subject:      New Polish Poetry: Kopenhaga by Grzegorz Wroblewski
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=windows-1252
Content-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable

*Kopenhaga* (translated by Piotr Gwiazda) is the first comprehensive
collection of prose poetry by Grzegorz Wroblewski, one of Poland=92s leadin=
g
contemporary writers.

Described by Marcus Slease as =93NY School poetry meets Kafka meets Polish
poetry (bruLion, etc.),=94 this bilingual edition is available from: Zephyr
Press (http://www.zephyrpress.org/new.php#kopenhaga) and SPD (
http://www.spdbooks.org/Producte/9781938890000/kopenhaga.aspx)

=93Alien to Joycean effulgence, *Kopenhaga* is nonetheless a book of silenc=
e,
exile, and cunning: silence instead of moralizing in the face of
modernity=92s indignities; exile from native land and language; cunning in
cajoling these conditions to sing a new song, one lacking in all
jubilation, still somehow victorious in the absolute character of defeat.
Grim, glancingly beautiful, always necessary.=94=97Joshua Clover

=93*Kopenhaga* is the study of a place into which we are all thrown as
strangers, =91an enclosed compound for the paranoid,=92 in which we all liv=
e a
public and familiar life with whomever we find. This is a book about a
changing Denmark, one none of us can leave=97nor should we wish to, because
place, as Wroblewski has it, =91is the most important thing in the world.=
=92
And with this, Wroblewski has written one of the most important books of
our time: these are at once unsettling and comforting, timely and wryly
moving poems about the laughable annoyances, limited joys, and the never
fully present sorrows of cosmopolitanism, the life of the citizens of the
world. Gwiazda has rendered this study in a language full of =91water and
shouting and whalers.=92 I can think at the moment of no better book for yo=
u
to read in this our immense and always new Copenhagen.=94=97Gabriel Gudding

=93The poet Grzegorz Wroblewski was born in Poland, lives in Copenhagen, an=
d
is perhaps best known in English translation, as here in the marvelous
versions by Piotr Gwiazda. A familiar figure everywhere, yet at home
nowhere, Wroblewski is the true poetic chronicler of our 21st century
diaspora in all its absurdities and anxieties. *Kopenhaga*, his book of
aphoristic prose poems*, *pulls out all the rhetorical stops to present us
with a relentless, sardonic, and hilarious picture of a culture (at once
highly particular and yet anyculture) as insane as it is public-spirited
and kindly. =91What terrifies me in Denmark,=92 our narrator remarks, =91(t=
he
land of Bohr and Kierkegaard, a caring and tolerant state with a high
standard of living, etc.) . . . is *homo sapiens.*=92 *Kopenhaga *is a
journey to the end of the night that always makes a U-turn in the middle,
to take in the latest folly=97and also self-rescue mission=97of the transpl=
ant.
Read it and weep=97and then laugh!=94=97Marjorie Perloff

Subject:      my new movie DAREDEVILS will premiere in October!
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=windows-1252
Content-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable

Hello,

I am very excited to share the news that my first feature DAREDEVILS will
premiere at the 2013 New York Film Festival's "Views from the Avant-Garde"
this October.

The screening will take place at Lincoln Center's Francesca Beale Theater
on Thursday October 3 at 6pm.

If you would like to attend this screening (and I hope you will!) you can
order tickets here:
http://www.filmlinc.com/films/on-sale/program-1-stephanie-barber-daredevils

Here is a trailer & other information: http://daredevilsmovie.com/
[image: Inline image 1]

A portrait of risk and language, the experimental narrative DAREDEVILS,
presents a writer as she interviews a well-known artist and feels the
reverberations of their discussion throughout her day. Visually spare,
still and verbose, the video considers three formal handlings of language=
=97a
dialog, two monologues and a song.

Starring KimSu Theiler <http://www.gobolux.com/>, Flora
Coker<http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0170087/>
 and Adam Robinson <http://www.adam-robinson.info/>, shot by Matthew
Thompson <http://www.imdb.com/name/nm5780055/>, and featuring the
voices of Susan
Howe <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Susan_Howe> and Jenny
Graf<http://jennygrafsheppard.com/>,
DAREDEVILS constructs a metaphor of an artist=92s life and work as
daredevilry. The piece was written and directed by Stephanie Barber.

The piece sits gently between video art, narrative and poetic essay. The
classic rising action, climax and denouement are sculpted, not by cause and
effect, but by the subtle movements to and from understanding that are
inherent in conversation. Bubbles of intimacy are blown and popped, begin
to be blown again.
Thanks for reading! Hope to see you at the screening,

HERE COME THE WARM JETS
City Lights Spotlight #10
By Alli Warren
http://www.citylights.com/book/?GCOI=3D87286100637980

"Warren's first book of poems is highly self-reflective, interestingly =
interrogative, and a lot of fun."=97Booklist

Charged with swagger and sensuality, tenderness and cold fact, HERE COME =
THE WARM JETS is the highly anticipated and brash, new book in the City =
Lights Spotlight series, penned by first-time author Alli Warren. Taking =
its title from the Brian Eno classic, Jets jumbles gender, class, and =
space-time perspectives into a chorus of contemporary idioms and lyrical =
longings. Against the daunting backdrop of 21st century consumerism, =
Warren launches her missives of sex and desire, in writing that is at =
once raw and sly. =46rom the Bishop of Worms to Flipper to E-40, =
nobody's safe from the easy virtuosity with which she makes language =
sing.

Praise for HERE COME THE WARM JETS:

=93Here Come the Warm Jets starts by cycling through swaths of factless =
job-voice before pitching an unfolding exuberant doom-diction through =
the book's positively evil prosodic middle. Relative time, absolute =
time, ornery time, palpation time, and a kind of time I can't name are =
all in play along the way. I think Warren's end of capitalism would come =
with the richest planes of full life, but only the poems and their =
upending of the never-ending blossom hull make me think so.=94=97 Anselm =
Berrigan

"Alli Warren unfixes belief in these poem-feeds while never dissolving =
it. The effect is a kind of infinitely mobile fandom with occasional =
sparkes."=97Lisa Robertson
"When form and form's fianc=E9 come maundering Alli Warren will undo =
them both with tart prepositional gambits and the vagaries of =
fortune-telling and a fine poker-faced command of stagecraft itself. =
With nods to the congress of manners (and hat tips too to Brooks, =
Duncan, and others) Here Come the Warm Jets plays at neither checking =
nor abashing but chronicles what it just might be to be beyond the reach =
of any drama, any architecture. This is one heavenly book."=97C. S. =
Giscombe

[little bit of follow up, this is from Ben Hollander]

When the article,

=91Il Gruppo=92 Surfaces to Respond to Heriberto Y=E9pez=92s Complicated Bo=
ok on
Charles Olson=92s Time in Mexico

http://www.poetryfoundation.org/harriet/2013/09/il-gruppo-surfaces-to-respo=
nd-to-heriberto-yepezs-complicated-book-on-charles-olsons-time-in-mexico/

appeared on The Poetry Foundations's Harriet Blog, the writer of the blog
 had asked for more info. from Il Gruppo. The writer stated:

"We=92re looking for more information on Il Gruppo in general, and are keen
to see them really wrestle with this [Yepez's] work and literary history.
Rumors circulate that they=92re looking to publish a small book on the
matter. We=92ll keep you posted. "(Harriet Staff)

Il Gruppo obliged and sent Harriet more info, as requested, but Harriet
could not post it, stating that they only provide links to other sites.

So Il Gruppo sent it to the UK poetics list, from where this statement
below is taken:

We appreciate Harriet's interest for "more information" about Il
Gruppo, and will be glad to provide it in the near future. For now, and
just to clarify: we  are not, as Harriet writes "really wrestling" with
[Heriberto] Yepez's work [on Charles Olson]. There are much  larger stakes
here.

Here is  one brief analogy to highlight the stakes, which have more to
do with how history is recorded and received than with Yepez=E2=80=99s so-c=
alled
theories.


If someone came along and wrote a book called The Geographies of
Undoing, for example, which stated: "I am not interested in Ammiel
Alcalay but I am declaring that he is a Zionist, that, in fact, he is
the prime example of a duplicitous, chameleon-like figure who, on the
one hand, purports to examine cultural politics through geography while,
on the other, dominates and collapses that geography into terms that
serve his Zionist purposes: to turn time into space. While most of his
readers may be unaware of this, his Zionism can only be discerned by a
closer examination of his relationship to his father who, in fact,
belonged to a Zionist youth group. Thus, we have the classic case of the
child unable to slay the father: the return, as it were, of the
repressed. Hence, Zionism."

Were someone to write such a book or make such a statement, we would
hope that a response might be forthcoming, a response from people who
actually know Alcalay's work and his long-standing political and
cultural allegiances with Palestinian groups and issues.We would hope
that a response would be forthcoming  from students, former students,
writers, peers, friends, family or, in fact, any parties with more than
a passing interest in verifying the historical record. We realize this
may be a lot, even too much, to ask. But at least one can strive=E2=80=94an=
d in
this case Il Gruppo is striving-- towards a more collective intelligence
that serves to expose baseless assertions, distortions, and outright
lies before they gain momentum. As is known, Il Gruppo is looking for
the space and form where such issues as we are raising will be forced
into the open, perhaps in the shape of a  small book, if anyone wants to
contact us about publishing one.

Benjamin Hollander for ll Gruppo

Just Saying, RAE ARMANTROUTs most recent book of poems, was published by
Wesleyan University Press in 2013. Just Saying launches in Ottawa on
October 3, 2013 when Armantrout reads in A B Series. Versed (Wesleyan,
2009) received the Pulitzer Prize and the National Book Critics Circle
Award. It was also a finalist for the National Book Award.  Next Life
(Wesleyan, 2007) was chosen as one of the 100 Notable Books of 2007 by The
New York Times. Other recent books include Money Shot (Wesleyan, 2011,)
Collected Prose (Singing Horse, 2007), Up to Speed (Wesleyan, 2004), The
Pretext (Green Integer, 2001), and Veil: New and Selected Poems (Wesleyan
University Press, 2001). Her poems have been included in anthologies such
as The Best of the Best American Poetry: 1988-2012 (2013), The Norton
Anthology of Postmodern American Poetry (2013), The Open Door: 100 Poems,
100 Years of Poetry Magazine, (Chicago, 2012),  American Hybrid (Norton,
2009),  American Women Poets in the 21 Century: Where Language Meets the
Lyric Traditionst, (Wesleyan, 2002),  The Oxford Book of American Poetry
(Oxford, 2006) and  The Best American Poetry of 1988, 2001, 2002, 2004,
2007, 2008, 2011 and 2012.  Armantrout  received an award in poetry from
the Foundation for Contemporary Arts in 2007 and a Guggenheim Fellowship
in 2008. She is Professor of Poetry and Poetics at the University of
California, San Diego. Writing in Poetry magazine, Ange Mlinko has said, I
would trade the bulk of contemporary anecdotal free verse for more
incisive, chilling poetry like Armantrouts.

RON SILLIMAN has written and edited over 30 books, and has had his poetry
and criticism translated into 12 languages. He has worked as a political
activist, editor, and market analyst. Among his honors, Silliman was a
2012 Kelly Writers House Fellow at the University of Pennsylvania, and the
2010 recipient of the Levinson Prize, from the Poetry Foundation. His
sculpture poetry (Bury Neon) is permanently on display in the transit
centre of Bury, Lancashire, and he has a plaque in the walk dedicated to
poetry in his home town of Berkeley, although he now lives in Chester
County, Pennsylvania. His new book is Revelator (BookThug, 2013).
Revelator is the opening poem in a major sequence entitled Universe. Its
the jumping off point for a work that, were Ron Silliman to live long
enough, would take him three centuries to complete. We are hopeful.
Universe is a poem of globalization and post-global poetics (an important
reason for publishing this key section outside of the USA). At its core,
it addresses the problem that there are only two global systems: the
biosphere and capital, while every response to these global systems is
invariably local. The first appearance of Revelator in a journal won
Poetrys Levinson prize, previously given to poets such as Robert Creeley,
Theodore Roethke, Geoffrey Hill, John Ashbery, Robert Duncan, Basil
Bunting, William Carlos Williams, Dylan Thomas, Hart Crane, Robert Frost,
and Wallace Stevens. Revelator launches in Ottawa on October 3, 2013 when
Silliman reads in A B Series.

*An exhibition of seventy-five letterpress and offset books and
broadsides featuring the work of contemporary poets, designed and
executed by Charles Alexander and collaborators at Chax Press in Tucson,
Arizona**
*
For thirty-five years, Charles Alexander has written, read, typeset,
printed, published, and taught poetry, and countless readers and writers
are indebted to his unstinting devotion.

While in college at the University of Wisconsin--Madison in 1981,
Charles teamed up with Alison Circle to form the Black Mesa Press, which
issued dozens of limited-edition books and broadsides by exciting and
important contemporary poets. Typeset, printed, and bound by hand (often
using handmade papers), the productions of the Black Mesa Press
exemplified a turn taken by a number of fine presses in the 1980s, away
from familiar and safe texts and toward experimental and innovative writers.

With a move to Tucson in 1984, Chax Press was born. Though making books
by hand has remained an important touchstone for the press, Chax
committed itself from the start to providing challenging work by
innovative poets in handsome, affordable trade editions.

For thirty years, Charles and company have pursued a critical and
exploratory poetics of publishing, through all the varied means at their
disposal. This exhibition of books and broadsides, which merely hints at
the scope and richness of their accomplishments, coincides with the
publication of two new Chax books by Portland poets: /?The Notebook of
False Purgatories/ by Standard Schaefer, and /The Identification of
Ghosts/ by Maryrose Larkin.
