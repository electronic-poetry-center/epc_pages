Have you ever felt were writing something other than what writing, that
the was beside itself, couldn't ground it in any thing at all? This piece
is a mess. If God exists, and I mean all sincerity, kill me now.

Here's where I admit failure. I've been wringing everything could out

real interest, lost among thousands pages nonsense. Meaning, value, good
and evil - reside within human heart, require frameworks presence

For myself I wish more people would post here - that it wouldn't be by and
large announcements.

I go only occasionally to blogs; I feel the space is too controlled in a
sense, like window-shopping. I'd rather someone scream at me here. And I
wish more people in fact would open themselves up here, that the list
would be a place of vulnerability as well as advertisement.

I had the privilege (luck, really, since the run-in was not planned) of
meeting Lyx Ish, aka Elizabeth Was, in the course of my visit to Dreamtime
Village last October.  (It was, in fact, at the community-run school where
mIEKAL and I had gone to meet Zon.)

Rarely a more radiant and charismatic being have I met.  Her energy was
overwhelming, and her interest and warmth disarming.  Not in the least
casual.  Alas, the meeting was all too short!

This is shocking and saddening news.  A tragic foreshortening. My heartfelt
condolences go out to you and Zon, mIEKAL, to the community at Dreamtime
Village and beyond.

Thanks for sharing the poems, mIEKAL.

And safe journey, Lyx Ish . . .   I'll keep thinking of you.

Jonathan

I agree, Alan. Thanks for saying this! Someone said to me recently that "the
list is the Forum, the blogs are the Boutiques," and I really like that way
of putting it. As someone who has an ambivalent relationship with blogging
myself (I admit, I have a blog), it has been interesting to watch this whole
process unfolding. In a way, it's almost like blogs have begun to
re-regionalize (and de-center) the poetry community into more local
communities, contrary to the notion that they might suddenly nomadize
everything. For example, a lot of the bloggers and blog-readers I know in
Boston only read blogs by their friends or people they know or have met
personally.

Best,

Tim

this is exactly right. charismatic, radiant, warm, brilliant,
outgoing, dynamic --a true multi-genius.  lyx is a one of a kind
being.  i refuse the past tense as all these things must still be
true.

They hang the man and flog the woman
That steal the goose from off the common,
But let the greater villain loose
That steals the common from the goose.

".....at a time when I am speaking to you about the paradox of desire -- in
the
sense that different goods obscure it -- you can hear outside the awful
language
of power.  There's no point in asking whether they are sincere or
hypocritical,
whether they want peace of whether they calculate the risks.  The dominating
impression as such a moment is that something that may pass for a prescribed
good; information addresses and captures impotent crowds to whom it is poured

forth like a liquor that leaves them dazed as they move toward the slaughter
house.
One might even ask if one would allow the cataclysm to occur without first
giving
free reign to this hubbub of voices...."

late breaking news...

As this report (posted below) from Karen Wald, a U.S. journalist (based in
both the U.S. and Cuba) demonstrates, Washington has carried out a coup in
Haiti. Whatever the opinion about Aristide and his government, it is clear
that the real issue is the violation of Haiti's sovereignty and
self-determination by U.S. imperialism. The Bush regime openly undermined
the Haitian economy, opposed the smallest reforms to address the injustices
and  inequalities and backed and supported the death squads and criminal
gangs that rampaged across the country.  It must also be emphasized that
Canada's hands are not clean. Ottawa has not been some neutral and
disinterested party: it has once again - under the guise of "peacekeeping"-
participated in and subordinated itself to U.S. schemes to subjugate and
supress the aspirations of the peoples and nations of Latin American & the
Caribbean for national liberation and social justice.

Let us be clear: the events in Haiti and the U.S. and Canadian interventions
portend and point to objectives beyond that island. Haiti is a test case,
staging ground and precedent to beging the process of eliminating the
growing anti-imperialist struggles and movements throuhgout the region,
particularly, Cuba and Venezuela.

The live reports on KPFA ( a radio station in California) and Democracy Now
radio ( a U.S. station) have brought out the
following:
--Aristide was taken out of the Presidential palace at 5 am this morning in
handcuffs after meeting there with the US ambassador James Foley. He was led
out by 10 marines. One of his personal guard and an ABC tv cameraman have
both confirmed that.
-- Ira Kurzban, attorney for Republic of Haiti, has accused the US of
kidnapping the Haitian president
--the home of the Port-au-prince mayor was burned to the ground and that of
another town's mayor was shot up, killing two inside (at least)
--Tom Foley said last night that the death squads were on the way to kill
Aristide and that the US wouldn't lift a finger to stop them...
LISTEN TO KPFA.org or Democracy Now. The media is filled with the lies the
Bush administration is putting out. NO ONE KNOWS WHERE ARISTIDE IS. HE DID
NOT RESIGN. He and his wife said over and over they would never leave before
the end of his term, on the radio, to Congressmen and friends - but that
doesn't stop the media from continuing to repeat the most outrageous lies.

Yes. I have a teaching asst this semester who used to work for
Aristide's govt.  she is in touch w/ all of this and told me the
below last night.  she is working hard to get the mainstream news to
cover the real story.  and to think i just gave NPR some $$ for their
!@#$#! fund drive and they're reporting the wrong news.  she thinks
aristide might be en route to south africa, which would be fairly
safe, but why would the US govt want him to be safe? i fear i fear.
things are getting crazier and crazier. stagnant little denmark is
beginning to look like a real alternative.

why aren't there interaction between web and list, blog and mail, if not

WORKSHOPS BEGINNING THIS WEEK

So You Say You Can't Write Poetry? with Marj Hahne
Six Wednesdays, March 3, 10, 17, 24, 31, and April 7, 7 - 9 p.m.; $150, $125
for members

As children we were natural poets, but by adulthood, we likely suppressed
some of the sensibilities that enliven our reading and writing of poetry:
(1) a fascination with wordplay and the infinite possibilities of language,
(2) an alert sensory perception, (3) recognition and acceptance of our
unique voice, and (4) patience with our learning process.

Designed for the beginning or tentative poet (although practiced poets will
find it enriching, too!), this educational and fun workshop will present
accessible poetic forms, sample poems, and prompts as structures that allow
for the possibility of poetry as we uncover or recover our individual poetic
voices. We will create a safe space for generating lots of original writing
while attending to the particulars of craft: language choices, the poem's
shape, and various poetic devices.

Marj Hahne is a poet and teaching artist from New York City. Her work has
appeared in Painted Bride Quarterly, Mad Poets Reviews, La Petite Zine,
Rogue Scholars, & New England Writer's Network. She also has a CD entitled,
notspeak.

with Kathryn Radeff

4 Saturdays, March 6, 13, 20, 27 10-12 a.m. $135, $110 for members. Single
class $35, $30 members

The magazine field is overflowing with opportunity. With the right approach
you can craft articles, sell and re-sell to worldwide publications. Open to
everyone, this four-week special workshop focuses on the fundamentals
editors are looking for and presents the secret to writing great marketing
letters. Through in-class and at-home exercises, Kathryn Radeff provides a
fun, effective, and motivational workshop designed to inspire the writer and
develop creative confidence. The workshop also includes creative
self-promotion methods and the business end of publishing. It is recommended
that you purchase the four guidebooks from the "You Can Be A Working Writer"
series at $5.95 each.

IF ALL OF BUFFALO READ THE SAME BOOK

JUST BUFFALO CHOOSES BOOKER PRIZE-WINNING NOVEL, THE GOD OF SMALL THINGS FOR
2004 IF ALL OF BUFFALO READ THE SAME BOOK

BUFFALO - Just Buffalo Literary Center has chosen The God of Small Things,
by Arundhati Roy, as the centerpiece of its 4th If All Buffalo Read The Same
Book program, which will culminate in a two-day author's visit on September
8-9, 2004. The God of Small Things won the 1997 Booker Prize for literature,
Great Britain's highest literary honor. Arundhati Roy became the first
non-expatriate Indian author and the first Indian woman to win the award.
The New York Times called the book "dazzling" and "remarkable," while the
Washington post noted, "It's hard to avoid using words like 'splendid' and
'stunning' to describe this debut novel."

Media, book clubs, organizations, educators, public officials and
individuals who would like more information or a reader's guide, as well as

In fact it would be nice if advertisements for poetry readings and
conferences were posted on the Buffalo web site, by region, city, instead of
on this list. Also looking for someone's address. As for "a place of
vulnerability," I completely agree.

Friday, March 5, 2004 at 7:30 p.m.

Devin Johnston is the author of the poetry collections Telepathy and Aversions
(new this spring from Richmond?s own Omnidawn Press) as well as
Precipitations: Contemporary American Poetry as Occult Practice (Wesleyan,
2002). Forrest Gander writes: "While his lexicon is rich and particular,
Johnston's line is severe, unadorned, and keenly cut to measure out the
subtle, counterpointed music which so strongly marks these poems." With
Michael O'Leary, Johnston publishes Flood Editions, an independent press. He
joins us from Chicago.

Susan Landers joins us from Brooklyn, NYC to celebrate the publication of her
debut collection, 248 mgs., a panic picnic, by Oakland?s own O Books. Kevin
Killian says she "has turned Pan on his head to spell out NAP, a nap in which
she sees and writes through the creepy children?s modernism of Rossetti,
Stein, Sandburg, Harryman, and Freud. This "panic picnic" is a fresh, engaging
look at the anxiety of a restricted vocabulary ? roll over, Esperanto, and
tell Basic English the news."

By the time of the Haitian revolution which took place in 1810 Haitian slaves were largely coming out of prisons in west Africa and
directly loaded on to slave ships.  The average life-span of a Haitian slave once actually in Haiti was five years.  It was cheaper to
work them to death and get new ones than to treat them decently.

The only free blacks were mulattoes -- usually having white fathers.  They formed the small middle-class that revolted in 1810.  Because
Napoleon was busy elsewhere they won and consolidated their power.  The French did send an expedition, but they largely died of yellow
fever.  There's a mystery -- it may have been the first case of chemical warfare.  Some histories argue that voodoo practitioners
exploded yellow fever powder all over the French and decimated them.

In revenge, the French demanded a payment of 50 million dollars from the Haitian government.  Haiti refused to pay and so the French not
only did not give them diplomatic recognition, but also forced America to snub them as well.  This situation continued until Haiti -- a
nation overloaded with people that were not meant to live -- defaulted on American loans in the 1930s and was invaded by US troops.

The invaders rewrote the Haitian constitution -- which said that only Haitians could own Haitian land -- and said that anybody could --
and huge sugar and coffee companies -- American and German -- bought up the best land and kicked all the small tenants into the cities.
The mulatto upper class held Haiti in the manner of colonials for their American masters until Duvalier.  Duvalier revolted and got the
presidency, and began to liquidate the mulattoes (some of whom have produced fine literary works, such as the Marcellin brothers who
wrote The Beast of the Haitian Hills).  Duvalier continued to do business with American companies, but American companies were never
completely comfortable with him.  When Aristide kicked out Baby Doc Duvalier it looked like a Catholic takeover, and like the poor would
win something at last in Haiti, and also that there would be a better climate for busness.  At that point I tuned out, and went on to
hotter countries.

But what is there in Haiti to get?  Due to agriculturalist imperialism their topsoil is rapidly being eroded.  The average Haitian has a
caloric intake of 1200 per day.  If you work in a factory sewing American baseballs you make about 2 dollars a day and sometimes you get
a vitamin thrown in.  A bowl of rice costs 60 cents.

The newspapers never say who these "revolutionaries" are.  My guess is that they are Duvalierists coming back while the US is tied up
elsewhere.  It's odd -- even the New York Times just calls them "the revolutionaries."

The US did engineer the fall of Baby Doc to help Aristide in.  They oversaw elections, and went to great lengths to help out under
Clinton's administration.

I haven't paid attention to the situation there in about a decade.

There is a GREAT BOOK of Haitian poetry called The Woe Shirt which was translated by Howard Norman.  Paule BArtok was the poet.  This
book was published in about 1980 by Graywolf PRess and has gone out of print.  Bartok was an intinerant poet who was often put in prisons
for his poems (even though they are not revolutionary but are very beautiful odd dreamy prose poems).

I haven't read Rene Depestre, but I understand that his book A Rainbow for the Christian West (Un Arc en Ciel pour l"ouest Chretien) is
worth a long look.  The surrealist leader Breton loved a Haitian poet named Magloire St. Aude, but I cannot understand that poet at all.
Breton said he was better than Mallarme.  There are only about 15-30 pages in all, as I recall.  I read them, and felt the bizarrely
beautiful vowels but couldn't put together what on earth he was saying.

Who exactly are these so-called revolutionaries?  Does anybody know if they are Duvalierists?  I can't imagine who else would have enough
of an organization there to bring off a revolution.  I also don't see why it would be in American interests to topple Aristide since so
much effort went into putting him in.

Apparently no Haitian president has ever left office without the use of force.  There have been some 60 coups.  Exciting place.

There is a difference between people who have genuine discussion to
contribute to a list-serv and people who just want to appear documented.


People (not just poets) cling to ornamentation -- anything -- and will
make it the 'work' of their life.

Paper license, blog, what's the difference?

I just read sections of Bruce's remarkable Lip Service and would like to=20

s an=20
invisible subject visible, the concept of the insufficiency of language -if=20
there were nothing beyond language, how could then language ever be insuffic=

In my view, in Lip Service, Bruce is joining the opposite camp, a group of u=
s=20
for whom the insufficiency of language, pushing towards its limits is an=20
enduring poetic concern.

Lip Service as a translation. Every translation must start with a misreading=
=20
of the original, with an "error," which opens up, fragments the original tex=
t,=20
moving them both beyond their themselves to a third space.

As Sherry Brennan observed, Bruce does not translate Dante word to word, but=
=20
space to space around the words. Bruce's "riffs" expand the space around=20
Dante's language into a language which is not quite Bruce's own. That is wha=
t is=20
remarkable about it. In souljam,which is a translation of the Turkish poet k=
=FC=E7=FCk=20
Iskender's cang=FCncem, I do a similar thing.

That's what translation is, a dialectics in space: two linguistic spaces=20
(codes, Benjamin's "modes of intention") moving to a third. Lucas Klein's=20
translation zine, CypherJournal (www.CipherJournal.com), will soon have two=20=
pieces, my=20
Translation: Contemplating Against the Grain and the interchange between Ken=

Johnson and Mark Ducharme, dealing with this subject in relation to Benjamin=

In Lip Service, I am struck how Bruce often chooses a relatively "abstract"=20
word in Dante, something more within his palette as an American poet, and th=
e=20
riff expands that pallette, around, into, beyond the original language :

wobbling baby syllogisms   sillogismi
silence flutter me out           silenzio=20
marble cupid pinking terror      cupidit=E0

"Cupidita," which literally means cupidity," becomes "cupid." "Terror" is so=

much a word unlike Bruce. In other words, as a translation, LS defamiliarize=

Bruce's own language, complements, thins it beyond its limits.

I hope I am not being unfair to Bruce's sense of his own work. I am not sure=

if he remembers it. Several years ago he, Pierre Joris, Charles North, I thi=

Charles Bernstein, and I were riding toward uptown in my car from The Poetry=

One might do well to read BLACK JACOBINS, by C.L.R. James, for a fuller
background, particularly on the question of America's having been "forced" by
France to snub Haiti.

Hi Ray, Alan, and All--

I guess I could *argue*  :)
that blogs and blog writing are not always, only, self-concerned, tho my
statement here will be, somewhat.  Of my 2 blogs, for example, predominantly
features the work of others.  I thought Guillermo Parra of Venepoetics
http://venepoetics.blogspot.com, put it nicely when he once refered to
http://texfiles.blogspot.com as an on-going anthology (while of course
anthologies have their down sides, too).  My other blog, Poetry_Heat,
http://poetry_heat.typepad.com, is set up primarily for my current poetry
course, and is meant to be a welcoming threshold for students and any other
folk who might be curious.  It has the syllabus and reading list, and some
student work posted.

But to my mind, unlike the more fluid facility of statement and response on
a list, especially this one, a difference with blogs is the slower pace of
dialogic engagement and development.  It takes days sometimes to recognize
that someone else has responded to something on your blog by linking.  There
are technologies that inform quickly, Comments, Atom, Technorati, and such,
but they take some investment of time and energy to manage and who has much
of those to spare?  Oftimes I think that blogging tends to make
super-manager types out of the blogger.  This is something of a problem for
what I think of as the point of blogging: to explore and highlight poetry.
Hard to do that if busy most of the time managing.  I'm not complaining: I
enjoy the challenge.  But it does make the whole experience full of paradox
and irony.

A list, on the other hand, is a place to start, enter, participate in a
conversation where the management is undertaken by someone else or something
else (the technical aspects are not much the writer or contributor has to
worry about).  Blogs can also be places for extended conversation, but in a
far more diffuse and dispersed way--not in the same way that a list will
sustain focus on a topic, so for the purpose of discourse community, perhaps
blogs are not as gratifying as a list.  Maybe that's one of the big
differences.

Alan mentions that in blog reading "the space is too controlled, like window
shopping..." so, yes, in blog writing there is also the sense of being part
of an arcade, of wandering-via-writing through what is analogous to brand
names (that inescapable tendency of consumerist culture, I suppose)--or
perhaps the Walter Benjamin kind of arcade?--has anyone yet discussed this
similarity?  Or I sometimes ruefully think (admittedly immersed in it
myself): all the pitfalls of a consumerist mall but no material or physical
being at all.  How very odd an activity for so many physical beings.  But
the wonderful aspects of blog community cannot really be reduced only to
those observations, either.

Thanks for raising the issue, Ray.

Best Wishes,

BathHouse is an online journal of hybrid art and hypermedia edited by
current and former Eastern Michigan University graduate students in
Creative Writing. It takes its name from the 19th-century sanatoriams,
bathhouses, and mineral water wells that flourished in Ypsilanti,
Michigan until truth in labeling laws were passed. The "foul smelling"
waters of the Atlantis well-in the vicinity of the current Jones-Goddard
dorm on the EMU campus-were bottled and shipped nationwide as a cure for
33 disorders of the blood.

[some words of profound wisdom from the younger generation.  Zon is 16
& facing the circumstances of the Great Unexpected.  I'm sure he'd like
to receive emails from those that were touched by his mother's life &
art]


and now a letter from ZON-
***************************************************

I want to let everyone know that I (Zon) am doing just
fine in this whole death/life process, just to say it
quickly and easily.  I have always been quite
accepting of the afterlife, even when I was a
"youngin" I would ask people what happens when you
die.  I now feel that Lyx knows the answer to the
ultimate question, maybe she can all tell us sometime.
  I am relieved that she didn't have to suffer in the
state she was in.  Her spirit can now soar wherever
she need might go, and in any direction in space and
time.  She of course is still living in all the other
times-spaces that she has ever lived.  We are all
still with her in our memories and our hearts, in the
past, and maybe even in the future.
    enough with the nonsense, I myself am doing better
in this then most, being that I have my whole life to
deal and understand with the situation at hand.  I can
definitely use any and all support that I can get.
Mostly what I need and want is people to come and be
creative with me, and make Dreamtime alive, something
that when it happens, is beautiful and magical.  I
hope to send more later, I keep hearing that people
where asking how I was doing, and I am doing fine in
all this.

So much love, going out, and coming in,

Zon

        Why death & love & such kinds lure content's dream onto paper, demand
the attention of words.  "I intend to exhaust the subject" she said of
the manner in epic & gladly noticed a growth of dyslexia.  How drinking
tea with a writer can start a fire on paper a week later.  Had the
writer been a woman.  Certain figures of speech are everywhere & in any
position.  As soon as you wear one for a while the fashion wears out of
it.  Is language itself the only other thing?
        Its true the distraction of the distracted recoils from
single-mindedness.  which large word can be a good or a bad thing
depends how far out you want to lift it.  I took the twinkle in my hot
& wandering eye & squeezed the guts out of it as sorely as a turtle run
over.  It was staring at alphabet colored paints dripping weird
incredible music heard between his sleep, how gray can be yellowish out
of a nyc window at five in the morning perfect height above the
streets, calmly lying in place even with the likelihood of rodents
passing, suddenly understood my pain.  Which meant feeling it really.
The Other, crouching hopeful, full-eyed.  And the Other, crouching
longing obedient.
        This is not allowed, this cross-out of remembering better which image
feels the text like a teenager.  Where is the point.  In taking a word
for blatant.  Sex has imposed more attention than death.  which hurts
more.  It was the train hit me, everywhere between my cunt & my heart &
later on including each.  As if I needed another excuse.  I did, & it
didn't work because when you excuse yourself you are longer at the
table but are someone else's meal.  I admit I said "eat me".  Still do,
though I no longer use words or situations, the fantasy can be so quiet
now I don't heard the moaning.  (At least I threw up in the cleaner
apartment.)

Dear friend,

In an attempt to escape responsibility for the misleading
statements that led the nation to war, President Bush has announced
plans to
form an independent inquiry to look into what went wrong.  An inquiry
would
serve the Bush administration well: it would envelop the issue in a fog
of
uncertainty, deflect blame onto the intelligence services, and push any
political damage into 2005, after the upcoming election.

But the facts need
no clarification.  Despite repeated warnings from the CIA and Defense
Intelligence Agency, President Bush and his administration hyped and
distorted the threat that Iraq posed.  And now that reality is setting
in,
the President seeks to pin the blame on someone else.  We can't let
him.

Congress has the power to censure the President -- to formally
reprimand him for his betrayal of the nation's trust.  If ever there
was a
time to use this function, it is now.  Join the call for Congress to
censure
President Bush now

I'll keep my nickel, thank you.  I only have a few of them.

The "revolutionaries" are familiar faces to any who have followed events in
Haiti in recent decades.  One of them, for instance, was convicted for the
murder of the Attorney General of Haiti's only freely elected government.

Mime-Version: 1.0

As someone who's only posted to the list about three or four times in
the past five years, I can't say I'm that nostalgic for knock-down,
drag-out fights on the Poetics list--in fact, I've always found them
profoundly alienating.  I'm bothered by the fetish of "starting an
argument" for its own sake, especially when it gets confused with
dialogue or community.

So maybe there's a reason that some of the "brightest lights" have
taken up blogging.  I've been blogging for about a year now, and I've
found it to be (for me) a much more amenable form in which to think
and talk about poetics.  And contrary to what often gets said about
blogs on this list--that they're "boutiques" where poets get to
"listen to the sound of their own voices"--I've always thought of
blogging as a much more humble mode of communication.  If you want to
tune in to my random musings, you can, but they don't land in the
inboxes of several hundred people each day.  More overheard than
heard, I guess.

I also like what Chris Murray said about the slower pace of blog
discussion--which gives me time to think about what I want to say,
and to explain myself at some length; the list tends to make me just
react.

Contrary to what Ray Bianchi suggested, I think blogs make
discussions about poetry more accessible, less "ghettoized," than
before.  Non-poet friends and colleagues who would never have access
to the Poetics list can and do look at blogs, and the odd mix of the
public and the private that tends to animate a blog can be more
appealing to a general reader.

And I have found that blogs can build poetry communities just as
effectively as a listserv.  I recently moved from the Bay Area to
Chicago, and felt like I was able to make contact with poets here
right away largely because we were reading each other's blogs.  I'm
not sure whether Tim Peterson meant his comment that blogs were
"re-regionalizing" poetry as a criticism; to the extent that it's
true, I don't think it's a bad thing--maybe, like politics, all
poetry is local--but if it's giving certain places (San Francisco,
Chicago, Boston) a clearer sense of themselves, it's also connecting
them to other communities elsewhere.

So has the Poetics list changed?  Sure, but I don't think blogs are
to blame.  If anything, the list is kind of a victim of its own
success.  As it's gotten larger and larger, and become something like
an official organ of experimental poetry--become, in short, an
institution--it's inevitably become more public and impersonal, more
like a bulletin board than a coffee-table conversation.  That's an
important role, and maybe it's a sign of the strength of a community
rather than its weakness.  Conversations take all kinds of forms, and
they don't all have to involve screaming.

following this, I do want to emphasize that:

if the reason you don't read blogs you love / want to monitor / the
reason "blogs seem scattered all over the web" is you aren't rolling
them into newsletters you can disseminate / formats you can read like
the old morning newspaper

        reason you aren't exporting yr blog into rss

is you haven't been to feedster (or the competing cos.) and figured it
out,

if that is the only reason you aren't looking at the valuable insights
of those limited to two posts a day on lists -- not only this one!

or the reason (I have this reason) of not *filtering* any of the dozens
of lists I'm on, but scanning the g, b, and u

then -- isn't that lame?

ok, then -- I also want to say -- I am starting another two reading

2) published poets teaching high school other than that fave of mine,

How about a simpler reason--lack of time? And that because most of the
insights aren't that interesting the available time often seems better
spent elsewhere?

This list has become almost non-functional except as a bulletin board
because of the two-message limit; that limit became necessary because of
the unusually flame-prone crowd it gathers. Not a good example of what one
can, and sometimes does, have at other lists.

Notwithstanding, I understand that some find it helpful, perhaps as a
discipline, to write essays in public.

I agree with all sides of this -- there are so many ways to phrase it,
make it a subject -- but I have to believe that off-list and onlist
everything isn't dull!

The blogsters were on friendster ages ago -- I was, too, but never tried
to add "friends" other than Richard Meyer -- so I wd like more of the
bloggers who aren't coming out of the journaling trad to chime in or
something...

Maybe the day of the email list in fact is over. Its advantage has been
that it comes in the most common of delivery systems, an inbox; its
disadvantage is that it occurs in the midst of exponentially-growing spam.

There is a relationship between email lists and the street - and between
blogs and privatization, vis-a-vis Mike Davis, etc. One can still travel
from blog to blog, conversation to conversation, but its moving through
neighborhoods controlled to the extent that the owners want them
controlled, designed, not according to a commons, but according to both
owner and software. It's easier, even with rss, to find lists of interest,
more difficult to find blogs.

Blogs are midway between homepage and email list, of course. And they do
open up to amazing discussion. But it does seem to me that the net is
transformed by them, a kind of contraction and contract, in a way that's
problematic, feedster or no feedster.

As far as flamewars etc. go, or vulnerabilities - these are things that
happen in situations of alterity, the imminence of the other, somewhere
between Levinas and Sartre. It's out of control, has the potential for
immediacy (but NOT the immediacy, say, of IRC or SMS/IM), and the issues
of governance generally, but not always ride the surface and its
textuality.

It's not that I don't like blogs - I do. But I miss the commons, even the
commons of, say, MOOs, and the equalities that these brings, and their
epiphanies. Governance issues on MOOs are wide open.

It's a question of democractic vistas in a sense - in relationship to
increasing corporate/spam pressure - not to mention censorship and
political pressure by just about every government, religious organization,
etc. Don't forget Scientology's attack and eventual bringdown of
anon.penet.fi.

The Net is changing. The most open form I've seen was at West Virginia
University, in the Virtual Environments Lab - they had a permanent more or
less open link to other places - video/audio projected into the workroom
vis-a-vis InternetII - and I was told even group parties were held.
Reading about this sounds common; watching the small-talk was uncanny. But
again this was real time, and it was possible to flame someone - alterity
and imminence were characteristic of the form.

There's also a question about collaboration, collaborative reading, and
sharing of resources - all of which are taken for granted, and constitute
a new paradigm among cultural workers, certainly among poets. So if one
works individually, if one's image or imaginary is so distorted and broken
and obsessively tended that it moves in other directions, rather than in
the direction of the other, it now becomes problematic. If I announced
that http://www.asondheim.org for example was a blog, that it would
contain my latest work in file 'xy,' that would be the end of it. There's
no room for response. Maybe communality (just to contradict myself) is a
burden, or should be problematized, as much as anything else.

Self-publication on lists, the materiality of lists, is something I and
others have talked about endlessly. There is a _lot_ of work that needs
lists for functioning - for better or worse, Meskens, Highland, mez, nn,
solipsis, l_oy, are just a few people who come to mind - not to mention
people like jodi who announce their presence/work on lists (and send to
them as well at times).

I feel as if my work is generally offensive to some, in spite of the fact
that Charles Bernstein, one of the originators of Poetics, invited me to
come on, and I've been sending to the list for close to a decade. You can
always keep me off your blogs.

Meanwhile, I'll listen to Kari Edwards - all of this is small stuff in
relation to the fury our coutnry is going through at the moment - and if
we don't take to the streets, don't release our own fury, things will get
worse and worse. We're all expecting an 'October surprise' here - if not
earlier - Osama captured, Giuliani for VP, a new terrorist attack, and the
Repugnants will be back in power, carried on the populist platforms of the

Blaming the blogosphere for what is lacking on
the poetics list is an old tradition,(old in internet-time)
and sounds to these old poet's ears like a cry of pain. This
is not unusual from Mr. Sondheim, whose precision
of perception is not the least bit
lost on a great number of poets, despite
its many fascinating, complex camouflages.

What a poet needs,  especially a long distance marathon
poetry runner, is response. Some say
there is never enough response for an artist, and that
might be true, especially for those who crave the energizing,
potentially infinitely expanding cycle of signal and response
between artist and audience.

It may sadden, alarm and confuse some to hear, given its tawdry, tinny
surfaces, that this is exactly what is delighting and challenging
many writers in Blogland. But the cycle (of signal land response),
that is occurring in this situation is unlike any that has ever existed
before, in the world of letters, it seems to me, and is not at all subsumed
under the model shaped by the cycle of argument and debate, the taste for
which is no doubt being stimulated (for some) by the pathetically tired old
clich=E9d debates now going on in the mostly false and fraudulent
US election process: another kind of Academy Award ceremony that is not eve=
n
funny anymore.

Though many realize all of this movie academy and election academy sturm an=
d
drang is almost completely devoid of meaning (not significance, of course),
does not prevent the emergence of the mentally stimulating, imagination-
appetizing aspects of the spectacle of debate, an ancient mode of provoking
the discovery and identification of greatness. But this election process is
the clearest proof of Guy Debord's theories anybody could ever want to see.
The Society of the Spectacle is beyond crisis; it is moribund.

Can I wonder aloud if this argument and debate method of exchanging
knowledge and inducing change, discovering truth, and uncovering greatness
is totally bankrupt? What might replace it? What could replace it?

Something is happening in Blogland and you don't know what
it is, do you, Mr. Jones?

affectionate regards to my list friends and literary comrades,
Nick Piombino

Alan and Tim:

I agree with your comments on the differences between poetics list and
blogs, but there's not much I can do about it. A listserv thread demands
rapid response to be relevant, within a day or so, or it falls into the
rapids and disappears. It's easy to lose a listserv thread when there's but
enough time to get the primary work done; many of us may not open, let alone
read, a listserv digest, this one included for days. With a blog, I choose
my own thread (I can unabashedly make it include my primary work, the
poetry); I can choose my own rate of response.

My argument? One's not better than another. Each contributes to the writing
community.

Best, Crag Hill

there's always the option of a forum setup...where threads are easily
separated from one another...where, also, users can subscribe to individual
threads, wider forum topics, entire boards, etc., & receive e-mail notices
when something new is posted...

in many ways, i prefer forums to lists...

A few things I've rethought, or that I would add to my post on this thread
yesterday:

Forms: it's not a contest between list and blog. These are more productively
understood not as oppositional sites but as differing forms--a point I did
not quite come to when commenting.  I am glad to see that Tim Yu did put it
that way and explained several things well.

Group blogs: these have interesting possibilities as one more version or
form because stimulus/response is always shifting amongst group members as a
presence, so contained yet unpredictable, thus could undermine tendencies to
enact blogging in ways that parallel a little too closely a consumerist
paradigm such as the mall.  The dynamic of unpredictability in a group blog
also seems to add energy though perhaps not much lengthily sustained
discourse on a focused topic or thread.

Activism: I agree that we are in grave danger: freedoms have been
systematically and steadily eroded, and all forms and voices of
discrimination are more prevalent and more self-congratulatory than ever.
Activism that brings on real change results from continual
commitment--vigilance--rather than sporadic reactions.  This administration
seems to be adept at anticipating reaction, so has become adept at choosing
which issues to foreground, hype, and overplay, as well as which ones to let
stay in the background--another of the Bushbag's divisive twists. With
little journalistic awareness and intervention, this tendency remains
unremarked and unchecked unless people counteract it by focused collective
action.  So there is a lot of political work to be continued.


Cheers,

 First a ferocious conformity, i.e. the more

This conformity..is masked in the po community..

incomprehensible squiggles..faux sit on yr ass
activism..platitudinous theorizing...borrowing

After reading all the responses I think that it is important to say that I
blog myself but I think that the question is larger, why is it that poets,
and poetry does not have a critical structure? The thing that I miss about
the poetics list from before blogs was that critical aspect, the fact that
people's work, and ideas got a good once over in these pages. In other
genres, Fiction, Essay, Painting et cetera there is a critical structure
that brings allot to the artform. Poets seem (apart from Gabriel Gudding,
and Alan Sondheim) timid to critique because we may want our work in that
poet's magazine and it would effect this. But I am glad that the idea led to
the discussion

Paul Sweezy, 93, Marxist Publisher and Economist, Dies
By LOUIS UCHITELLE

Paul M. Sweezy, a Harvard University economist who left academia and
became the nation's leading Marxist intellectual and publisher during
the cold war and the McCarthy era, died Saturday at his home in
Larchmont, N.Y. He was 93.

The cause was congestive heart failure, his daughter, Lybess Sweezy,
said.

Mr. Sweezy did not think of himself as a Stalinist or sectarian. His
Marxism developed as a response to the Great Depression, and his mentor
was a famed conservative economist, Joseph Schumpeter, who counted on
spirited entrepreneurs to lift the economy through a process of
destruction and rebuilding. While Schumpeter wanted less government, Mr.
Sweezy wanted more to offset what he considered capitalism's failings.

Still, the two men worked together at Harvard in the late 1930's and
early 1940's. Schumpeter cited his young friend in several of his own
works and endorsed Mr. Sweezy for a tenured professorship at Harvard,
even campaigning on his behalf. The slot went to a non-Marxist, and Mr.
Sweezy soon left academia. Because of an inheritance from his father, a
banker, he had enough money to support himself. Mr. Sweezy later told
friends that if he had been forced to work for a living, he might have
been more of a conformist.

Instead, in 1949 he became co-founder and co-editor of The Monthly
Review, an independent Marxist journal published in Manhattan that he
continued to edit and contribute to until well into the 1990's. The
magazine still appears, although its monthly circulation has fallen to
7,000, from 12,000 at its peak in the 1970's. For the first issue,
Albert Einstein contributed an article titled "Why Socialism?" and over
the years the bylines included such famous radicals or Marxists as W. E.
B. Du Bois, Jean-Paul Sartre, Che Guevara and Joan Robinson.

"The Monthly Review was attractive to people who were leaving the
Communist Party and other sectarian groups," said John Bellamy Foster, a
co-editor of the publication now. "It was and is Marxist, but did not
hew to the party line or get into sectarian struggles."

That reflected Mr. Sweezy's approach in the 100 articles or so that he
wrote over the years and the more than 20 books he signed as author,
co-author or editor. The most famous was "Monopoly Capital: An Essay on
the American Economic and Social Order" (Monthly Review Press, 1966),
with Paul A. Baran as co-author.

That book argued that unregulated market economies have a tendency to
stagnate and to develop oligopolies in which a few companies dominate
each industry and keep pushing up prices, fattening profits for the
oligopolies but damping economic activity because of a lack of price
competition.

What saved the United States from that fate in the 1960's, the authors
wrote, were temporary phenomenon: military spending, robust consumerism
and the growing demand for autos because of rapidly expanding suburbs
and the new Interstate highway system.

Paul Marlor Sweezy was born on April 10, 1910, the youngest of three
sons of Everett P. Sweezy, vice president of First National Bank of New
York, and Caroline Wilson Sweezy. He earned a bachelor's degree from
Harvard in 1931 and his Ph.D. in 1937. By then he was a Marxist, having
taken that step during a year at the London School of Economics.

"I became convinced," he wrote much later, "that mainstream economics of
the kind I had been taught at Harvard had little to contribute toward
understanding the major events and trends of the 20th century."

Still, back at Harvard, as a graduate student and then an instructor, he
came in contact with Schumpeter and a friendship flourished, although
they supported different solutions for ending the Depression. For
Schumpeter, President Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal measures
suppressed entrepreneurs in their normal process of creative destruction
and innovation.

For Mr. Sweezy, who borrowed from Keynesian theory as well as Marxism,
government planning and intervention had a role, although working people
also had to intervene. Listening to their debates, Paul Samuelson, the
Nobel laureate, spoke of Schumpeter as "the foxy Merlin" and Mr. Sweezy
as the "young Sir Galahad" who early on "established himself as among
the most promising economists of his generation."

During World War II, Mr. Sweezy spent four years in the Army as an
officer in the Office of Strategic Services. After returning briefly to
Harvard as a teacher and having failed to gain a tenured position, he
left in 1946 to pursue the goal of establishing "a serious and authentic
American brand of Marxism."

The pursuit was not easy in the McCarthy era. He found himself in the
courts in the 1950's after he refused to turn over to the attorney
general of New Hampshire his notes from a lecture at the University of
New Hampshire. The attorney general accused him of subversive activities
and the case eventually went to the United States Supreme Court, which
ruled in Mr. Sweezy's favor.

Mr. Sweezy's first wife, Nancy, and his second wife, Zirel, survive, as
do three children, Samuel, Lybess and Martha; two stepchildren, Jeffrey
and Jennifer Dowd; seven grandchildren and two great-grandchildren.

i hesitate to post in on this thread, but i do think there are some
fundamental issues at stake in this thread...

on the one hand, as alan sondheim suggests, blogs are simply part of
a growing online suite---lists, irc, moos, muds, and so forth... and
we'll each be free to pick and choose on the basis of what we like,
technical difficulties notwithstanding... i've never myself much
liked moos/muds, for instance, and i've always gone online primarily
with the intention of seeking out dialogue (as opposed, e.g., to
role-playing, which puts me somewhat at odds with the gaming
communities, and at odds with more performative engagements, and at
odds even with argument as such, though i imagine that all true
dialogue presupposes some degree of conflict, and though i love a
good debate)...

times have changed---quickly... the web itself changed the internet
irrevocably... while giving us the archive, it seems also to have
given us the ability to archive our lives (i'll set aside the matter
of whether this is symptomatic of other cultural-social-regionalizing
trends)...

now:   just as some people will be better at dialogue, others will
prove better at archiving, and blogging, and so forth... to be
candid, i don't want to read all of the blogs written by the folks on
this list, not least (and this is one reason why i hesitate to post
on this thread) b/c you all don't express yourselves with equal
aplomb (i am trying to be nice)... but also b/c what you all have to
say, and how you enact/demonstrate what you have to say, doesn't
really interest me...

this is ok, though, right?---b/c this is what it means to say that
each is free to pick and choose, as above...

but to zero in a bit:  in point of fact---and again, i'm trying not
to be harsh---i'm much less interested in what ron silliman has to
say about bertolucci (re which i think i can offer up some comments
that are at least as provocative) than in what he has to say about
berkeley and brautigan and the 60s... since i wasn't in berkeley in
the 60s, i find this to be of historical interest to me as a poet...
but there may be another issue at stake here too---i.e., as to why
i'm reading ron on berkeley side-by-side with his remarks on
bertolucci...

now i'm on the verge of saying something about the current state of
poetry and poetics, but i'll leave that for a book, b/c that's how
much space i need to say it... i certainly don't mean to beat up on
ron---and what's more, even if i DID beat up on ron (sorry for
dragging you into this ron!), he'd still have those 100,000 hits,
right?... which is an odd, or at least different, form of assessment
than we're accustomed to making, when you think about it...

still, there is one rather elementary observation i'd like to make
here:  and this is that, in part b/c of spam, but also as a
consequence of the larger and larger number of typing anthropoids who
are making their way online, things are getting, well, just a bit
overwhelming, yes?---whether in terms of blogs or in terms of lists
or whatever... one alan sondheim was one thing, ten alan sondheims is
another thing altogether (and here again, not everyone can do what
alan does, so---)... my way of saying, if i may, that attention span
may be a nonrenewable resource, and that quantitative differences can
have qualitative effects... one poetry blog is one thing, 400 poetry
blogs is another thing altogether, and 4000 poetry blogs may be a
sign that we think we're more different (or, uhm, articulate) than we
are...

i have an argument about this that goes something like:  more readers
turned writers (which has historical precedent)... for another time
maybe...

to be candid, i think we're reaching something of a breakpoint (or,
another breakpoint, as the web has ushered in several already, it
seems to me) in terms of attention span---which as i see it assumes
only that many of us would like to spend a few hours a day OFFline...
will exploiting new technologies of communication/expression in and
of itself foster a more dialogic poetry/poetics reality?... not
anymore than will this list automatically foster dialogue...

just look around...

and there may in fact be limits at work here---functional limits... i
know it's not popular, generally, to discuss limits on this list, but
that the human eye can't see a single frame at 24 frames/second might
prompt us to give some thought as to what a dialogic limit might be,
properly speaking and in terms of something approaching a community...

anyway... i take it as axiomatic that dialogue is vital to sustaining
a healthy arts environs... i certainly don't mean to suggest that we
shouldn't be exploiting our new technologies---i mean to say that we
would probably do well to bring to our exploits a working sense of
what we hope to achieve vis-a-vis other typing anthropoids...

and from where i'm sitting, we're coming up a bit short, collectively
speaking... i mean, if only to judge by kari edwards's stated
concerns re the planet (*this* planet)---which may not be the datum
we would want to use on a daily basis, of course, but which does seem
to me a reasonable way of situating our concerns---the online world
as currently articulated is managing, if not to intensify, then
certainly not to mitigate the divide e.g. between art and commerce
(which to my way of thinking ought to be mutually and beneficially
dependent)... and if the commercial, profit-driven possibilities of
the web, say, are permitted to run roughshod over art, well:  i don't
think this bodes well for art OR commerce, never mind whether
distribution of poetry profits in the meantime (b/c as we all know,
just about nobody is getting rich off of poetry---which poets ought
not to use as an excuse for dropping off into a dogmatic slumber)...

so apologies for putting it this way, but:  attention to the quality
[term used advisedly] of what we're expressing/communicating may be
the only way to offset what i see as these encroaching numbers... by
"quality" i don't necessarily mean stylistic nuance, if that too...
if all i can do here is make an appeal---and all i can do here IS
make an appeal---i would ask, as presumptuous as it may be OF me to
ask, that those of you who imagine your work as bloggers,
discussants, what have you, work even harder to make your words
matter...

now, you see why i didn't want to post in?... thanks for listening,
at any rate...

best,

Thanks for this, Tim. This is actually the most eloquent comment on the
subject that I've heard lately. It really helps me to see both sides (are
there sides?), and shows me that blogs and listservs are not necessarily in
competition, as some have implied, but can even cooperate with one another.
I also want to thank everyone involved in this discussion for (so far) not
turning it into an argument per se.

I am also moved and intrigued by Nick's comment regarding the "bankruptcy"
of dialogic or dialectical interaction and discussion. This is a new
thought, almost an extension of the Language poets' point that the world
inside the poem reflects the politics and means of production of the world
outside it. In a way, Nick's comment itself can be seen as a dialectical
move to "trump" Langpo's faith in argumentation and thought (dare I say
"progress"?) as curatives. At first read, this comment struck me as
extremely cynical and made me want to go jump off a bridge right now (notice
that he doesn't propose a solution, except to say it has something to do
with "the medium," not the message), but then I started to think about
whether it might be possible for this listserv to learn something from blogs
and bloggers in this sense. Is there a way we can have a discussion that's
non-combative or non-agonistic but in which a lot of information and ideas
and emotions are shared? I'm also on Annie Finch's WOM-PO list and the
difference between these two lists is like night and day. I mean hey, I have
my kill-the-father days too, but maybe there's a way we can butt heads a
little less and be more constructive?

My last comment is that I think we all need to be willing to admit we're
wrong sometimes. I mean, I think that's the purpose of a discussion or
exchange, whether it's within a group or between individuals, and the
purpose of poetry really, to change and be changed by writing. We don't
always have to "win."

Best,

Tim


-------------------------------------------------

As someone who's only posted to the list about three or four times in
the past five years, I can't say I'm that nostalgic for knock-down,
drag-out fights on the Poetics list--in fact, I've always found them
profoundly alienating.  I'm bothered by the fetish of "starting an
argument" for its own sake, especially when it gets confused with
dialogue or community.

So maybe there's a reason that some of the "brightest lights" have
taken up blogging.  I've been blogging for about a year now, and I've
found it to be (for me) a much more amenable form in which to think
and talk about poetics.  And contrary to what often gets said about
blogs on this list--that they're "boutiques" where poets get to
"listen to the sound of their own voices"--I've always thought of
blogging as a much more humble mode of communication.  If you want to
tune in to my random musings, you can, but they don't land in the
inboxes of several hundred people each day.  More overheard than
heard, I guess.

I also like what Chris Murray said about the slower pace of blog
discussion--which gives me time to think about what I want to say,
and to explain myself at some length; the list tends to make me just
react.

Contrary to what Ray Bianchi suggested, I think blogs make
discussions about poetry more accessible, less "ghettoized," than
before.  Non-poet friends and colleagues who would never have access
to the Poetics list can and do look at blogs, and the odd mix of the
public and the private that tends to animate a blog can be more
appealing to a general reader.

And I have found that blogs can build poetry communities just as
effectively as a listserv.  I recently moved from the Bay Area to
Chicago, and felt like I was able to make contact with poets here
right away largely because we were reading each other's blogs.  I'm
not sure whether Tim Peterson meant his comment that blogs were
"re-regionalizing" poetry as a criticism; to the extent that it's
true, I don't think it's a bad thing--maybe, like politics, all
poetry is local--but if it's giving certain places (San Francisco,
Chicago, Boston) a clearer sense of themselves, it's also connecting
them to other communities elsewhere.

So has the Poetics list changed?  Sure, but I don't think blogs are
to blame.  If anything, the list is kind of a victim of its own
success.  As it's gotten larger and larger, and become something like
an official organ of experimental poetry--become, in short, an
institution--it's inevitably become more public and impersonal, more
like a bulletin board than a coffee-table conversation.  That's an
important role, and maybe it's a sign of the strength of a community
rather than its weakness.  Conversations take all kinds of forms, and
they don't all have to involve screaming.

one final thought for now, and i'm done for the day:  perhaps blogs
would work best  in fact were they to be constructed around the
"cabinets of wonder" idea (i'm thinking of lawrence weschler's book
on same)... i.e., were they to intensify the very boutique quality
that alan finds problematic, in order to create, or approximate, a
sense of wonder...

which we can always stand more of...

just a thought, and maybe i'm entirely off-base here... btw, and just
for instance, i'm finding *this* discussion provocative and engaging
if only b/c we've managed, what, a dozen or more posts together in
less than 24 hrs. on a single topic or topic set, and w/o a
meltdown...

I disagree with _Ted's_ assessment of _Lonnie's_ argument against _Mark's_
clear description of Hank Thungworst as a Loophole poet, stemming off of
_Dingo's_ critique of Serrault. Loopholism defies permanence with its sorry
guises of "flipness" and "bigamy," and in no way edges upon Langpo's cool
slinging of dialogic nuance.

For a while now I have been reading the work of Snook Hansen, a master of
the modern lyric form. Snook's incessant drambling has been a clincher in
the development of the Snot poets, that is poets who address the
metaphysical qualities of "snot" as a critique of the L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E
movement. In these lines, Snook disengages from partial critique and mires
himself in syllogisms of want and waste.

Reading the NY Times coverage last night there was strangely no mention again of
who the "revolutionaries" were.  They weren't even giving names.  There was a
complete page devoted to the "revolution" but almost no information was given.
I did note a few crucial clues -- the "revolutionaries" were having their press
conferences from Petionville -- an elegant suburb of Port-au-Prince where many
houses have swimming pools and BMWs in driveways in stark contrast to the rest
of Haiti.  This is where the Duvaliers lived.  What appears to have happened is
that Aristide wasn't playing ball with American or European business people and
they wanted him out and have decided to go back to the Duvalierist regime where
nobody has any rights, but at least the corrupt government in power didn't
attempt to interfere with the international corporations who are sucking the
goods out of Haiti, and usually not paying taxes in return.  So the only source
of money is American government aid for the military, and some church money
filtering in through often corrupt local sources.  There are also a lot of drug
transfers from the Southern American sources apparently and no doubt that has
produced a few local millionaires, and they probably have something to do with
this "revolution" too.

But I think the main thing is that Aristide hasn't been playing ball.  He's a
purist, and "doesn't compromise" as one US official put it.

When I did research on Haiti some 15 years ago I was really trying to understand
Andre Breton's role in a revolutionary uprising in the 1950s that led indirectly
to the rise of Duvalier, and didn't stray too far from that agenda, so I don't
know many of the contemporary "faces" in Haiti.  I did get a sense of how
intractable the political situation is there, and admired Aristide's willingness
to try to clean up that Augean stable.  I also got a sense of how the Jacobin
background of their political milieu has led to a perpetual bloodbath as it did
during the French revolution.  There is no sense of a trust for your political
enemies.  Then, there's zombification for some, and having to pay off witch
doctors to prevent zombification, there's an incredible AIDS rate, rape of
villagers is common by the police, and to try to do anything to change the
situation is obviously dangerous.

And yet an interesting literature comes out of there.  I really liked Graham
Greene's novel The Comedians -- set during Papa Doc's revolution.

Brent, I wasn't able to open your link.  Thanks for it, though.

Since I am more or less new to the list I continue to naively think that
a conversation is possible on the list.  I've had a bunch of them,
although mostly backchannel.  People tend to shriek at me on the front
channel.  But through backchannel I have had really great conversations
with about ten or twenty people, have been contacted by editors, and even
got a love letter!  For some reason, the front channel doesn't function.
Perhaps this is due to the professional nature of it, as Harry Nudel has
said.  Everybody worried about tenure, and publishing opportunities.

I've only been in a few email conversations and it seems to me that
everybody ends up nuking everybody else in ways that they wouldn't if
they actually knew one another.  It seems to promote paranoia,
self-righteousness, and other ugly traits.  Maybe this is because the
people who are prone to these things can't find any kind of conversation
anywhere else and so end up on these listservs.

I live in a tiny village an hour and a half from any larger city.  I
don't know anybody here who's interested in the poetry that interests me,
so I suppose that for me this list is fairly functional.  I imagine that
people who have a lot of other options in reality for discussing poetry
in cafes or while going for a walk with any number of friends and so on
might find this a rather horrible medium.  I think if I was in Seattle or
Paris I wouldn't have tried it, and would certainly have left by now.

Beggars can't be choosers, as they say.

I liked Timothy Yu's message a lot.  I find it funny though that people
who think that they can change the world into one of perfect peace (as
many of the poets on this board seem to imagine that we can do without
war!) are often so completely nasty.  Pol Pot thought he was a wonderful
man until the day he died.  John Lennon probably did, too.  I take it as
a given that people are complete monsters, and this board usually
verifies my sense of this, so I like it well enough.

Aristide has gone, the death squads are back, and on the streets the looters
rule

The man once dubbed the Haitian Mandela has left anarchy in his wake

Gary Younge in Port-au-Prince
Monday March 1, 2004
The Guardian

For the past few days the Haitian capital, Port-au-Prince, has been growing
accustomed to a gruesome ritual. As night falls the streets empty in fear of
the wrath of the chimeres - armed pro-Aristide gangs - on looting and
shooting sprees. As day breaks, people emerge to see where the bodies have
been left. Corpses can lie here for days until someone clears them up.
"It costs 300 Haitian dollars [£21]," said a resident, Jocelyn, as she
spread disinfectant outside Christ the King secretarial college on Saturday
morning, where a body had lain for two days. "I don't know who it is because
they took all his money and papers."

But yesterday the sun rose to a new reality. The president, Jean-Bertrand
Aristide, was gone, and, as word filtered out, the morning was punctuated by
gunfire in the capital while others danced on the street in the rebel
stronghold of Cap Haitien.

Mr Aristide leaves behind a nation riven by civil war, paralysed by social
chaos and crushed by poverty. The man once hailed as the "Haitian Mandela"
is now branded a dictator. The priest has become the pariah. This is the
second time he has been forced to leave the country at gunpoint, but no one
expects him to be returning any time soon.

Those seeking a straightforward trajectory from good to evil will not find
one in Mr Aristide. He was never that sort of leader and Haiti has never
been that sort of country. The very messianic qualities that greeted his
ascent - in 1990, on being first elected, he found the people sweeping the
roads before him with palm fronds - contributed to his downfall.

Death squads

The leaders of the death squads Mr Aristide disbanded now control much of
the country and prepare to march on the capital. The country that assisted
his return 10 years ago, the United States, encouraged him to leave. His
political fortunes have been turned upside down.

In a country where the media is either unreliable or unavailable, fear
travels faster than fact. Early yesterday morning the chimeres stopped
journalists to ask if the rumours about Mr Aristide's departure were true.

Within an hour they were shooting at the press, blaming them for besmirching
their president's name.

Two days of relative calm preceded a storm of looting, murder and mayhem.
Police guarding Haiti's main prison near the National Palace ran away, some
discarding their uniforms to avoid detection. The jail emptied. An estimated
2,000 inmates, including murderers, melted into the crowds. Looters hit a
police station in Petionville, an upscale suburb of the capital, carting
away police hats, T-shirts, helmets and other bits of police uniforms.

On a main thoroughfare, a barricade of burning tyres sent up a wall of thick
black smoke. Aristide supporters added more tyres to fuel the fire.

Haiti has had more than 30 coups and 19 years of American occupation in a
200-year history blighted by dictatorship at home and international
isolation.

Mr Aristide, for most of his political life, espoused social justice and
practised the politics of authoritarianism. As a radical priest in the
1980s, he called capitalism a "mortal sin" and encouraged his flock in the
shantytown of La Saline to do the holy work of fighting repressive regimes.
But he also praised the smell of burning tyres - a reference to the
"necklacing" where supporters hung flaming tyres on opponents' necks. In
1988 the Salesians expelled him from their order, accusing him of inciting
violence and exalting class struggle.

But at a time when liberation theology was in vogue throughout central
America, what worried the Catholic church endeared him to the Haitian
people. In 1990 he won a democratic election with a landslide.

Before he could be inaugurated he had to first see off a coup attempt.
Before his first year was out he had been overthrown and exiled to the US.

Many of those who now oppose him say that those characteristics that made
him a popular priest also made him an awful politician; he neither
compromised nor made strategic alliances, but laid down the law and expected
it to be followed.

"He hasn't changed," said Jean-Claude Bajeux, the director of the Ecumenical
Centre for Human Rights, and Mr Aristide's former minister of culture. "We
made the mistake of thinking he was a political leader. But he does not know
or understand what a political party is for."

Mr Aristide's three-year exile in Washington DC altered his politics and he
sought to accommodate US interests. But if his own personal failings sowed
the seeds of his demise, then the circumstances of his return fertilised
them. He had little leeway to improve the economic conditions of the poorest
country in the western hemisphere, while in a nation more accustomed to the
bullet than the ballot, he had no army to fall back on.

"If you have a populist without a real agenda, you're feeding a demagogue,"
commented Lawrence Pezzullo, a former US special envoy to Haiti.

As unrest grew, Mr Aristide relied increasingly on armed gangs. The name of
his party, Lavalas, is Creole for torrential floods. In the 2000 legislative
elections the party did sweep away everything before it, committing
widespread fraud that lead to a freeze on millions of dollars in aid.
Despite winning the presidential elections in the autumn of 2000 with 92% of
the vote, Mr Aristide had by then lost much of his democratic legitimacy.

It led swiftly led to instability and then insurrection. Last month the
rebels seized several towns, many of which the government took back with the
help of armed gangs. When, last week, the rebels took the second largest
town of Cap Haitien and refused to negotiate, it was clear Mr Aristide had
lost his authority.

The question now is what will replace him. The political opposition is a
broad-based coalition of students, human rights activists and business
people. The armed opposition is run by former death-squad leaders. Having
achieved their primary aim of getting rid of Mr Aristide there is little
they will agree on.

Meanwhile Port-au-Prince is like a military garrison. The sun has set on Mr
Aristide's political career. It remains to be seen whether it will rise on
someone better.

Hi everyone,

For those of you who happen to be in the Providence, RI area on March 9th,
Michael Gizzi and I will be hosting the second reading in our new Downcity
Poetry Series:

Gary Sullivan and Nada Gordon!
Tazza
250 Westminster St., Providence, RI
Tuesday, March 9th, 7pm
vallet parking! (really!)

Hope to see some of you below.  A li'l info below on our reader's meteoric
careers....

-m.

Nada Gordon was born in California, studied alternative poetries in the Bay Area
(at SFSU and beyond), and wrote an M.A. thesis on Bernadette Mayer at U.C.
Berkeley. In 1988, she moved to Japan, where she taught English, wrote
textbooks, sang in a band, studied butoh, and co-edited a magazine, AYA. She
moved to Brooklyn in 1999. Author of More Hungry, lip, Rodomontade, Koi
Maneuver and v.imp, she incorporates elements of movement, song, and vocal
manipulation into her performances.

Poet and cartoonist Gary Sullivan is the author of How to Proceed in the Arts
(Faux Press) among numerous other publications.  He and Gordon edited the
Poetry Project Newsletter in 2003.

Gary and Nada are frequent collaborators and, as Publisher’s Weekly has said,
“the duo's tour-de-force is surely Swoon, an electronic literary courtship that
spirals into real life…In March of 1998, Nada posted a query on a poetry
discussion list, and Gary replied ‘backchannel,’ asking if she were the same
person who went by ‘gordon’ and lived in San Francisco years earlier. Amid
Sullivan's disintegrating marriage in New York and Gordon’s failing Tokyo
relationship, the two produced the equivalent of 5,000 manuscript pages over
the course of a year as they traded quips, seductions, likes and dislikes,
ideas about aesthetics, sexual preferences, photos, poems and poetry gossip,
worries, fears and neuroses, plans for visits and the failure of love at first
sight and its aftermath. It makes for the most true-to-life literary love story
since Robert Browning and Elizabeth Barrett hit Florence.”

Gary and Nada are also the Ma and Pa Kettle of a new poetry movement called
“Flarf” –– of which more when you come to hear them in person!

remember this?

silence.  exile.  cunning.

toward whom (toward what--the establishment?) does it apply any more?

how about:

no meters, no counters, no gathering of intelligence.

why would anyone want to do this, this "gathering of intelligence"?

how is this radical?  how is this progressive?  how is this avant-garde?

no meters, no counters, no gathering of intelligence.

use your intuition!  if you don't develop it now, you won't have it when you
need it.  (and you're gonna need it soon!)


no meters, no counters, no gathering of intelligence.


the only real feedback is by direct communication!

"Cabinets of Wonder." Weren't these also called "cabinets of curiosity"?
Rectilinear honeycombs of found objects elucidating the spectacle of found
objects brought home from 16th century voyages of discovery. Revelation and
illumination of the previously unknown - sometimes no doubt new knowledge
conflated with ownership. (I got you, e.g. Fijii Islanders, by more than
your curious skull and its measurements).

So, I would suggest, Joe, that that the cabinet/blog analog is not on the
mark here, in that the cabinet "exoticized" the stranger, often perhaps with
an allure towards possession and control.

I think blogs enable something opposite of that. An intimacy, of an inside
speaker/image maker (the blogger) looking out as well as invitation to look
in at the process of ones' (the blogger) looking out. Read today's intimate
accounts on "Bagdad Burning" juxtaposed with the CNN/NY Times horrific
accounts of yesterday's bombings  and a world becomes much more particular,
persuasive and real.

The "boutique" analogy, not yours, Joe, also falls short. The street
boutique is motivated primarily by sales, as it must to survive. Most
bookstores, for example, do not encourage lengthy conversations between the
employee and the person off the street. The mandate to sell shades the
amount of time for any "non sale," public dialog.

Blogs are self-publishing agencies and my sense is that they mimic every
historic feature of any kind of publishing from gossip columnist gushing,
high toned editorial judgements, reviews, the daily news, etc., complete
with "letters to the editor". Ironically a number of the pieces on my blog
have been picked for publication on either other online mags or in "hard
copy." In fact I think the difference in reading something online compared
to reading the same thing in print can be very instructive. Is it more
"real" when reproduced "in print." Is it considered more legitimate to have
have work grounded and designed in pulp? Or in public performance? I think
there is a dance going on here between blog, print and performance where
each one is pushing the other. Personally I remain a book person - tangibles
for me, indeed, are more real. But I concede that monitors may ultimately
rule, or, at least, become a unique medium unto themselves, as aura filled
as I find books.


 Clearly the internet - at this time - is in full democratic flush. To the
degree that blogs have a public intention, it will be curious to see if and
what point exhaustion depletes the impulse, and what point financial
(income) considerations begin to shape a form that can requires much labor.
In the case of poetry blogs, I suspect, the fate of many will reflect the
history of many small presses - a hot form of dialog in generational moment
and then gone or, alternatively, often institutionalized within the
non-profit support system. Just guessing here.

"Forums" and the various "lists" are related gestures and solutions, not
competitive but a mimic of other public, non-digital formats.  What's
wonderful to me about all of this is the  Internet's engagement of a much
broader and more serendipitous audience - contacts in a previous generation
that would have required being in the same City, University or a pilgrimage
to either. Blogs reshuffle possible ways to view and review and participate
in the traditional hierarchy of hard copy magazine and book publication, as
well as the context of teaching. No one, obviously, is going to disappear. A
Helen Vendler probably continues to promote and shape which poets get
teaching jobs where, and, if not, Vendler, x, y. and z others will fill that
role. Yet the blogs and the lists, at best, will operate as a shadow
government, stimulating the new and questioning the orthodox (such as is the
best of small magazines and presses).  Undoubtedly those anxious for tenure
or employment will be understandably publicly timid but such is ever the
same. And the ones that are most innovative and young now will be employed
variously later. The wheel moves on.

March 4, 8:00 PM
Amherst Books
8 Main St.
Amherst, MA
Info: 413-256-1547

Eric Baus has channeled the consciousness of migratory animals, of a
collective self, of others, of objects. He has written an open letter
from a marvelous land just beside this one, a place of interior wonder
and intimate noise. It's The To Sound (Verse Press): bent, exuberant
notes that will wake you up wherever you are.

Philip Nikolayev's new collection of poems, Monkey Time, won the 2001
Verse Prize and was published by Verse Press in 2003. He co-edits
Fulcrum: an annual of poetry and aesthetics. His poems have also
appeared in such journals as The Paris Review, Grand Street, Verse,
Stand, Jacket, and many others across the English-speaking world.

jeepers, i post 7 kb on blog/anti-blog and only 1 tiny kb on "wonder
cabinets," and now i have to make good on the latter, which i dashed
off in haste w/o really thinking about it much... well i'll give it a
go, and remind readers of what anselm hollo posted here not long ago
about poetry being a "dangerous toy" (he was quoting someone else,
yes?):

indeed, stephen, you've sent me back to weschler's ~mr. wilson's
cabinet of wonder:  pronged ants, horned humans, mice on toast, and
other marvels of jurassic technology~ (i have the 96 vintage pb)...
both "wonder cabinets" and "cabinets of curiosity," yes... weschler's
book, you may know, concerns l.a.'s museum of jurassic technology
(curated by david wilson, who has since won a macarthur)... in fact
the point weschler is making has less to do with possession or
exoticizing than with the potential for invoking a different
understanding of knowledge and knowledge-making... for weschler,
wilson's museum undermines authority, authenticity and the like, in a
postmodern or premodern vein...

now certainly the internet has at one level always constituted an
outside to established lines of authority---this is clearly its
imagined locus for some (like yours truly), but i would argue also
that its challenge to insider-isms *can be* very real... perhaps less
real in some sense than a decade ago, but when i think about
moveon.org, more real...

and if blogs constitute a further challenge to those authorities that
tend to dominate the (discursive) real, very well then... there might
be a problem with this too, for that matter, but i'm all for
democratic participation as against "tell the rabble to be quite/we
anticipate a riot"... in any case, how does this challenge to
authority come about?... i suspect, but can only suspect, that we
underestimate the capacity of our rhetorics to elicit something like
wonder ("wonder" is an interesting word in this regard, as there are
versions of it in numerous languages, but its etymology is entirely
mysterious)... for me wonder points to what we can't quite explain...
and sometimes, once in a great while, "i can't explain" (i have the
rock lyric in my mind, yes) leads to a new kind of engagement with
the real... wonder (among other things) might be the basis for an
affirmative form of resistance...

ergo my sense that blogs may become performative sites for the
articulation/dissemination of new, or certainly, other, kinds of
interiority... i almost believe, w/o thinking too awful hard about
it, that the heteronaut movement might find its proper home in
blogville... a very static read, i grant you, and i think, in
thinking about it more, that it's something of a stupid, if not
stubborn, stretch to conceive of one's interiority as being "put on
display" in order to elicit, what did i say? oh yeah---wonder...

but then again, i'm feeling a bit put on display even *here*, and
that's never stopped me from waxing stubborn, if not stupid... have i
fetishized my, uhm, self?... i wonder (sorry)... thus far poetry
blogs do seem, in any case, to be about exposition, to judge by the
interiorities thereby exhibited (whether or not they include poetry
and the like)... i.e., most blogs i visit are explictly trying to
persuade me to think a certain way about such & so (about, say,
BLOGS), much as i'm trying to persuade in this post (oh, yeah, and
entertain a bit too, if you don't mind)... and that's one kind of
performance, perhaps indeed the kind with which i'm myself most
comfy, most drawn to, inasmuch as i seem to be drawn to dialogue
(ergo my desire to see more of same *here*)...

i write poetry, i think, for other kinds of reasons (dialogue too
though)... the tyranny of dialogue notwithstanding, i'll take it any
day over mum's-the-word rhetorics, which i get plenty of, thank you
very much, as a bureaucrat-academic...

anyway, if you go at it from the perspective of self-publishing, or
publishing selves, well i can't see as how that won't ultimately
peter out, as you suggest, b/c one has only so much time to write,
let alone eat, and the charm of that variant of self-publishing is
bound to wear off over time---i mean, on an hourly or daily or weekly
basis, depending what your blog sked is... doesn't mean folks
shouldn't (or won't continue to) blog... and i could be wrong here,
in any case---perhaps many of you have a greater stomach than i
reckon for putting your pixeled interiority(ies) on display (as
opposed, i mean, to directly attempting dialogue and exchange, as i'm
trying my goddamnedest to do at the moment, again), and less of an
appetite for... food?... persuasion?... self-possession?... then
again---

best,

joe

March/3/04....NYTIMES...

"The man, James Coleman, 35, is accused
of killing Shani Baraka, 31, and Rayshon Holmes,
of Irvington. Mr Coleman, also known as Ibn
El-Amin Pasha, is the estranged husband of
another Baraka daughter, Wanda Wilson Pasha,
who shared the Piscataway house where the
shootings occurred with her sister, Ms. Baraka."

  So in this world..the wife is Wanda Wilson Pasha..
but the husband is James Coleman,..NOT Ibn El-
Amin Pasha...& Baraka is Baraka..not aka
LeRoi Jones..or stein is steen is stone...

"Amina Baraka, the mother of Shani Baraka
and Wanda Pasha, said: "We only want
justice but sometimes it is not always clear
what justice is when you are black in this
country. We want him to have a fair trial
now, and i just hope he spends the rest of
 of his natural life in jail"

  An emergency committee is being formed
to raise money for Ibn El-Amin Pasha's
defense...we are hoping to get Johnny
Cochrine to take the case...just another
example where a powerful wealthy politically
connected family can use its influence..
we are also concerned that Ibn El-Amin
Pasha cannot get justice from STUART
KAPLAN..the country prosecutor..

absolutely brilliant -but I think somewhat dogmatic- poetic ruminations, Yep=

This is the first time I could ever say I am proud to be an amerikan...
I never thought I would ever say that, after years of secret deals,
secret  and not so ward, lies, sex scandal,  partizan bickering, and
the slow and subtle silencing of the collective mind of amerika...

but now,

I am so inspired, I see amerika finally waking up after a long sleep,
even if it pits one position against another... everyone is waking
up... it is about time amerika...

just in the last couple weeks, a mayor  in san francisco, and a court
in Massachusetts, inspired a revolution. civil disobedience is
everywhere; a mayor getting arrested for marring a couple and vowing to
do it again.

towns, cites and counties across amerika are taking part.. showing up
for a new truth on what it means to be free...  college campus's, and
local news papers in places you might not expect are being defiant.
individuals taking heroic stances, defying the state and getting
married on the steps of state capital, protest in the street...

it is the hot topic on every local, state and nation politician - call
them today... inform them, now is the time...

call you news papers.

write an editorial

send something to transdada... http://transdada.blogspot.com/

have small protest

wear a pink are band

rise the rainbow flag...

go out in the street and make some noise so all of amerika.. or the
entire world can hear you /us.. no more entrapment and torture for
queer...


today is as good as any day for a revolution!!!

Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

I think poetry is self-glorification.  I don't see how any community of poets
could come out of it.

It's like having a community of models, or a community of Democratic candidates
for the presidency.  They are competing against one another for a niche.

In Darwinian terms, this should make them into enemies.  While some small group
of poets might band together and identify themselves with a small group of say,
surrealists, or language poets, or whatever, and thus compete as a team against
the vast mass of poetry, and even be supportive in this vein (NY school poets
come to mind) -- an avant-garde is a flying wedge, a nation-state, competing for
whatever small resources of self-glorification are available.

A list of a thousand people such as this one cannot but break into competitive
groups.  It's possible to find friends in such a list, but it isn't the most
likely outcome.  It's more likely that you will find enemies.

I think even poets such as Charles Olson are creating monuments to themselves.
Maximus is mostly that.  There are other great things in the epic poem, but it
is mostly about Charles Olson: his tastes, his being citizen number one in
Gloucester (fuck Ferrini is the topic of one of his longer screeds), and so on.
Ginsberg's poems are about him and his friends and how important they are.

I am probably naive, but I think poetry is mainly self-glorification.  If it
isn't that, I might be misreading it.

Subject:      Re: HAITIAN HISTORY LESSON w QUESTION
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

This poem appeared about twenty years ago in a journal called Rolling Stock,
edited by Ed Dorn.

HAITI

In colorful dresses the Arawaks
Were pushed off the edge of a cliff by the conquistadors
In metal armor the conquistadors
Were pushed off the edge of a cliff by the French colonialists
In plumed shirts the French colonialists
Were pushed off the edge of a cliff by mulatto revolutionnaires
In neo-colonialist plumed shirts the mulatto revolutionnaires
Were pushed off the edge of a cliff by American imperialists
In business suits the American Imperialists
Have the woods stripped
And the cliffs of Haiti are washed into the sea
Leaving on the surface only the black hat of Duvalier



At any rate, the poem needs to be updated.  I still don't see who is pushing who
exactly.  It looks like drug lords are pushing Aristide off the cliff.

The only possibility of changing this is American troops, once more.  But I
think we are too tied up in Iraq at present to open a second front.  So it seems
clear that Haiti will be run by murderous thugs and gangsters -- leftovers from
the Duvalier regime, and their ragtag army.  What a fate to have been born on
such an island.

TEATRON

Presents

THIS NIGHT
a Play in Two Acts
by Robert Majzels

Directed and designed by Ari Weisberg
Starring David Rosser, Howard Jerome, and Jack Kennedy
The Berkeley Street Theatre
26 Berkeley Street, Toronto
March 3-20, 2004
For tickets call 416.368.3110

After ten years of failed struggle as a political and union activist, David
Hellman has come home in defeat and humiliation. His older brother Benny,
who stayed home and dedicated himself to building a successful business, is
all that remains of the family. The two brothers rapidly conflict over thei=
r
opposing visions. When the spirit of their dead father is raised, the facts
of his experience in the camps becomes the site of a struggle for meaning.
Which brother has been true to their father's experience as a survivor of
the Holocaust? Which has betrayed the legacy?

From award-winning Canadian author and playwright Robert Majzels comes This
Night, a play in which past and present conflate, history and imagination
are blurred. As in the ancient texts of the Talmud, Majzels presents a
dialogue of differing possibilities, a relentless search for the truth in
the knowledge of the impossibility of ever entirely attaining that goal.

On one level, this play explores the dilemma of the children of the
Holocaust, saddled with a memory they can never entirely call their own. At
the same time, Majzels tells us, we are all survivors of the Holocaust,
struggling with the failure of Western civilization.

Governor-General Award of Canada recipient Robert Majzels is an accomplishe=
d
novelist, playwright, and translator. He is the acclaimed author of two
novels: Hellman's Scrapbook (Cormorant Press, ON, 1992) and City of
Forgetting (Mercury Press, short-listed for the 1998 QSPELL Fiction Award i=
n
Montr=E9al). His third novel Apikoros Sleuth, is slated for release 2004
(Mecury Press and Potes & Poets). His full-length play This Night won first
prize both in the 1991 Dorothy Silver Awards (Cleveland Ohio, USA) and the
1994 Canadian Jewish Playwrighting Competition.

Regime Dream

one regime maintained
the dream of another
     nested in its heart
but with washed out

     a loving farce at the
historical

and still the people
suffered    smiling
while suffering    in
the confused dream
at the     crossed roads
laughing while
suffering     slowly
inside    slowly
inside   the dream
of the other
regime

ah, but the role of the US troops in this instance seems to be to clear the way
for the takeover by the thugs -- (Keep in mind that Guy Phillipe was trained by
the US in Ecuador prior to his earlier attempts to overthrow the government) --

The US govt.has said that the rebels have no role to play in the political
solution in Haiti.  The US President's press spokesman said that we had made
possible a "peaceful, democratic and constitutional solution."  Meanwhile, the
constitutionally designated successor to the President is nowhere to be seen,
the "rebels" have threatened to arrest the Prime Minister, and Philiipe has
declared himself the head of the Haitian military, which, we may recall, no
longer exists under the Haitian constitution.  and several persons convicted
for participating in massacres have been releasedfromprison by Phillipe and
company --

and did anybody notice the attacks on paintings and sculptures yesterday?????

Joe, I am not trying at all to dismiss "wonder" from the interior potential
of a number of possible blogs. I am often in a state of astonishment when I
scroll down Chris Sullivan's blog. It is, at best, a cabinet of wonderous
curiosity. And so this is true of several others whose various awes I won't
indulge - whether they be for sheer intellectual "pointitude" or an intimate
view of personal cosmetics that, well, kind of, perfume the screen.

Yes, Fred Wilson takes on museum acquisition and practice in mostly fresh
ways (tho sometimes repetition of strategy produces a predictability of
outcome and consequently a boring redux no matter the contents of different
museums). And definitely cracks the magnitude of the colonial skull.

But my point was the function of the original collector - whether the
original "cabinet" folks or not - is/was to proclaim a power and control
(either by presence of objects or the omission of them). We see exhibited
the skulls of the indigenous but not the whips that "embraced" them.  A CIA
or KGB blog would be comparable, i.e., no manuals on torture are  in
evidence.

I suspect the impulse of many of us who blog is to strip the anonymous and
articulate/disclose the materiality and value of what the dominant discourse
ignores which, of course, as you point out is part of the dialog. "They" do
watch, do surveil - we know the script, either severe reprisals,
incorporations, co-optations, or just nice new public openings in the larger
field! (i.e.., you pay your dues).   And we instantly recognize the fake
blogs - Dick Gephart on the road (yuck), canned, scripted stuff.
Technologically I suspect one can say that the blog is a new mirror in the
woods - and definitely a fresh moment. But privy to all the problems of
mirrors - hopefully, when broken (crasshed)  not seven years of bad luck!

But such critiques can be aimed at other media - Black Mountain College's
magazine carries the probe of the authentic (even when wrong headed) where
one might read the American Poetry Review (no matter the occasion of some
things good) with a sense of muddled editorial intention other than a sense
of providing multiple career support.

Haiti doesn't seem as politically necessary as Iraq or the middle east.
Thus, we won't see a large American presence there until it becomes
politically necessary, i.e. until there is enough media coverage for the
American people to become 'outraged' and a mission into Haiti can be spun as
'liberation' or 'inifinite justice'.  What a fate to be born an Island...

And perhaps I'm naive, but while I think poetry can be
self-glorifying, it can also be about creating
something interesting with language or with traditions
of discourse (not all poetry is made of language). I
recall John Cage's remark about finding "a way of
writing that, though coming from ideas, is not about
them but produces them." I like this productive
conception of writing. Not using art to produce
monuments, but to produce thought, to produce ideas.

Best,
Joseph

Mmm. I think it's self-glorification, or can serve selfish means - maybe a
poet thinks of establishing a monument, or a legacy, but these are things
that drive people in all kinds of professions.

A poet can still enjoy the work of other poets, and learn from other
writers - even if they have selfish motives - I don't think anyone is free
from selfishness.

Whether they realize it or not, writers in a time period are working
together (though they may not realize it) at creating the canon of that
generation - enriching the body of literature - so if we view that as the
goal, rather than something purely individual, but also for everyone, and as
a memoir and testament to our time, then it can be different.

Although, I'm sure there are people building their own Great Pyramids in
preparation for their death.

If that were the case, I think I'd rather be like King Tut, and bury mine a
bit - people wouldn't grave rob me, but maybe they'd appreciate me all the
more in a few thousand years.

Then, some people build such weak monuments, like bad modern architecture,
or those terrible office buildings from the 50s and 60s with no sense of art
at all. I'd rather leave something behind other than crumbling,
rust-streaked concrete and rebar.

stephen, thanks for that... i suppose i must add only that i regret,
for my part, the passing of the Age of Lists (and i write this
knowing that lists may be here to stay)... it was nice while it
lasted, and being nowhere on anyone's poetry radar, lists gave me a
place to go and be noticed (self-glorification, maybe, but surely a
sense too that i was part of something greater than myself, which i
evidently desired)... still, all good things must come to end... a
list like this one may continue to function in such terms, no
question, but much more modestly, and not simply b/c of the sheer
numbers subbed, but b/c the terms of engagement (which are a function
of the aims of such a list, and also its history, the social mood,
online traffic in general, etc.) seem, to me anyway, much more
diffuse... it's difficult to be as evangelical about the medium today
as i might have been a dozen years ago, albeit even then i
understood, i think, that the technofix was just that---a fix, in all
senses of the word... perhaps all we really want or need anyway is a
makeshift forum that permits communicative expediency and the like to
bump up against more expressivist interventions...

but why?... as a heuristic?... to build community?... to spread the
word?... to feel at home?... to be successful?... to be happy?... to
fiddlefuck?... to test the ties that bind?...

so blogs are something of a fix for now, taking (some of) us from
point A to point B... again, i may start one myself, i may not (he
loves me, she loves me not)... i'm not sure this is what you call
progress (& what did dorn write?---"progress:  slow but inexorable"),
but it's certainly succession... here's hoping we don't end up,
figuratively speaking, back at point A...

best,

joe

Listserv's more like college radio
and blogs more like cd download swapping?

one's a little newer than the other,
but some of us--
especially with not much "spending power"--
still listen to college radio
(even though the djs don't tell you the names of the songs
until like an hour afterward)....

just like some of us prefer to see live music
than the hip dj (so hip there's no dj booths in men's sections of clothes
stores)
or be live music

all analogies are false

or poor internet---
they seem to think you're an end in itself
(medium message etc....

it probably all has something to do with my new demon word
ELECTIBILITY

(more on this later,
  but THE ELECTIBILITY FACTOR
    seems to have greater significance than just this Kerry guy---

Subject: Influence Key Vote on Florida Keys     SEND ACTION~a15732u30516

Action deadline:   March 8, 2004

Dear Alan,

The Florida Keys are an American treasure:  an irreplaceable archipelago with coral reefs, seagrass meadows, mangrove islands, and pockets of tropical forest.  The Keys are also under tremendous stress and face a serious new threat.  Next Tuesday, Florida's governor and cabinet will vote on a proposal for the Keys that would increase allowable development by nearly 25 percent, eliminate a requirement to remove antiquated septic systems, and fail to protect terrestrial habitats.  These officials need to hear that citizens from Florida and across the United States care about the Keys and want them protected.

The Keys are home to the world's third-largest coral reef and their waters support more than 6,000 species of marine life, including endangered hawksbill and Kemp's ridley sea turtles and West Indian manatees.  The islands' forests shelter endangered species such as the tiny Key deer, found nowhere else on Earth.  In all, 30 federally-listed threatened or endangered species are found in the Keys.

Unfortunately, poorly managed development has devastated the Keys environment:  Forests have been bulldozed, the ocean is contaminated with sewage pollution, and the reef has lost more than 30 percent of its living coral.  Recently, important progress has been made to combat these problems, but it will be undermined if the governor and cabinet endorse the damaging proposal now before them.

FOLLOW THE STEPS BELOW TO SEND FREE LETTERS URGING FLORIDA'S GOVERNOR AND CABINET TO PROTECT THE FLORIDA KEYS.

To have the greatest impact, follow the instructions to send a personalized letter and also call these officials.  Please explain why the Keys environment is important to you.

Dear Sirs:

Because of my deep concern for the Florida Keys -- one of our nation's best-loved and most spectacular ecosystems -- I urge you to ensure that the Department of Community Affairs proposal for Monroe County will not increase development, relax pollution controls, or fail to protect terrestrial habitats.

The Keys sustain the world's third-largest coral reef (comprising nearly 90 percent of Florida's reefs), more than 6,000 species of marine life, endangered animals like the Key deer (found nowhere else on Earth), world-class recreational and commercial fisheries, more than 3 million visitors every year, and an economy that employs thousands and generates more than $1 billion annually.

The $6 million Florida Keys Carrying Capacity Study showed that development has significantly eroded the ability of the Florida Keys environment to support its inhabitants, both human and wild.  Hammock and pineland forests have been bulldozed, nearshore waters are contaminated with viruses and excess nutrients from sewage (threatening both human and environmental health), beach closings are increasingly common, and the reef has already lost more than 30 percent of its living coral.  Not surprisingly, "National Geographic Traveler" magazine just ranked Key West third from the bottom in a survey of 115 international travel destinations, with a score low enough to qualify for the "Getting Ugly" category.

In considering the proposal before you, I urge you to require that:

*  No increase in development will be allowed, except for affordable housing projects.

*  Wastewater treatment systems must be operational in the upper, middle, and lower Keys before the nutrient-reduction credit requirement is eliminated.

*  The temporary development moratorium will include all lands in Conservation and Natural Areas and all native habitat of one acre or greater Keys-wide, and will remain in place until regulations are implemented to permanently protect these areas.

I applaud the state's progress in addressing many of the Florida Keys's most significant problems, and I urge you to do all that you can to conserve the Keys's irreplaceable natural resources for current and future generations.

Sincerely,

Your name and address
will be inserted here

Press Release

Call to Artists
The Village of Key Biscayne Civic Center Public Art

Submission Deadline:
May 21, 2004

Call to Artists
The Village of Key Biscayne Civic Center Public Art

The Village of Key Biscayne Art in Public Places Board is seeking
artists to develop artwork for the Village Civic Center.
Artwork Opportunities
Two sites are being considered for artwork for the Village of Key
Biscayne: the oval-shaped plaza at the entrance to the Civic Center
campus and the circular plaza and transition space adjacent to the
Village Green. Both sites anchor the new Community Center along the
major circulation and pedestrian axis of the Civic Center grounds.
Submissions may be prepared for one or both sites, depending upon the
artist preference.

The Civic Center includes the Village Hall/Police, Fire Rescue Station,
Community Center, a park, and new roads and infrastructure.

Artists are being sought to develop these plazas as special places that
integrate interesting surfaces, volumes and landscaping. The Art in
Public Places Board is seeking artists with experience in outdoor, urban
site-specific projects. Artists who work with functional sculptures in
materials such as ceramic, wood, metal, water and others should apply.
Artists should be sensitive to the history of the Village, its
environment and to the expected uses and landscaping of the plazas.

Selected artists will be invited to develop detailed proposals. This is
a fast-track project with a total budget of $120,000.00 for the two
sites.

Submission Deadline
Requested materials must be received in a sealed envelope by 4:00 p.m.,
May 21, 2004, at the address below:

Village of Key Biscayne
Art in Public Places Board
Office of the Village Clerk
88 West McIntyre Street
Key Biscayne, FL 33149

Selection Panel
The Art in Public Places Board will review materials, rank applicants
and make recommendations to the Village Council. The Board and/or the
Village Council reserve the right to accept or reject any or all of the
artists' proposals. The Council will make final determination on all art
projects to be developed and built.

Additional Information
Artists should only submit requested materials in specified format. No
original art should be submitted.

Artists should not contact Board members or Village staff about this
project. All official information is posted at this site:
www.keybiscayne.fl.gov

Subject: CIRCUMFERENCE responds

Dear Friends,

As many of you know The U.S. Treasury Department's Office
of Foreign Assets Control recently declared that American
publishers cannot edit works authored in nations under
trade embargoes which include Iran, Iraq, Sudan, Libya and
Cuba.

As the editors of CIRCUMFERENCE, a journal of poetry in
translation founded on principles of free and open
exchange, we want to respond to this issue in the most
direct way that we can. We would like to dedicate a
substantial section of our next issue to poetry from these
countries.

We are firm in our belief that not only do we have the
right to do this, but that translators working from the
languages of these countries are providing an incomparable
and necessary service to audiences in this country.
Cross-cultural exchange through poetry and translation is
a force to be reckoned with.

We are writing in the hope that you will assist us in this
effort in any way you can: by helping us to gather work
for the issue, by recommending translators working on the
poetry of these languages, by sending us your own
translations, and by spreading the word about this
project.

The issue is projected to go to press in early summer. We
will collect translations through mid-April. CIRCUMFERENCE
publishes all poems in the original language alongside the
English translation, so please ask translators to send the
original along as well. For more information about
CIRCUMFERENCE, visit our website at
www.circumferencemag.com
<http://www.circumferencemag.com/> .

Thanks so much for your support and for any suggestions
you might have.

With best wishes,
Stefania Heim & Jennifer Kronovet

I've been planning to use Harryette Mullen's
S*Perm**K*T in my contemporary poetry course this
semester. However, I could not get copies because the
person who ran Singing Horse Press, S*Perm**K*T's
publisher, was in the hospital. I've just received
news that he's passed away. Terrible news.

Does anyone know his name?

Best,
Joseph

Gill Ott, there was lots of discussion about him a week or so back,

i find the squawk boxes quite charming (although i never checked to see
whether there was something in mine until prompted by your missive)

there is in them something clownish, squeaky, like some whoopie cushion or
an untied balloon or a comb whistling

it also makes me think of chicken, and i imagine a blog-coop populated with
perches and perches of them

(i don't like mine because i cannot temper the template)

squawk boxes stack up like russian nesting dolls: comment on comment on
comment.
je t'entends pas, comment?

squatting by a squaw-berry, scooping squaw-root, angling squaw-fish -
squawk boxes are quite square & only sometimes answer our querries

square the possibilities of enchantment,
extending vertically from the ruminant horizon

i know very little and not where moos or muds live, have no patience for
chat-rooms or instant messengers, place postage on few listservs, have a
blog but not the way one has a dog or a laptop, scribble in a journal and
sometimes even spill coffee, write notes on napkins that i often lose, carry
a piece of chalk in my pocket or just in case, invent new letters on dusty
windows, still exchange letters with select friends and cut my own envelopes
(i'll send you an H if you send me a C), and think, thinking isn't the same
it was in the times of plato, and a poet writing from the bottom towards the
top of the page wouldn't be the same if he wrote in reverse

squawk also makes me think of a certain way of looking, somewhere between
squinting and gawking

under the squawk box lid there lies a swarm of neologisms
spelled by neologians ooking flemmed manfoon hrunt abselish

there is, too, something quite secret, how frightful, squawk boxes unbound
disengaged from blogs that spawned them!

one thing is certain: squawk boxes don't smell

well-oiled like cogged wheels

"squawk me tonight," he said. "qui so quacked met on gash!," she replied.

squawk boxes can be bristly or plush

not much more than a haiku fits into a squawk squad

hence, it seems, we like the shapes into which we fit our thoughts
perhaps, or without a doubt, there is a scribe who never did write until he
found the right squawk box

{{says who, in defense of a squawk box, who never filled one!}}
{{ergo,
}}
{{paradoxically,
}}

Subject: Re: Blog Arguments...

When blogs first appeared (at least when I first became aware of their
existence through an argument Gary Sullivan was involved in), I was
fascinated by them. Here were writers putting out their daily thoughts, and
I could respond to any aspect of them which chose. There were also fewer
blogs. One could still explore, pick and choose, etc. I particularly liked
those which had a certain, or defining obsessions: a few examples, Gary's
interest in any subject beyond the perimeters of American culture, Jordan
Davies's half to himself observations and ruminations, Nada's assertions of
a decorative poetry, Casey's absolutely brilliant -but I think somewhat
dogmatic- poetic ruminations, Yepes's entries, like mine, looking at
American poetics from outside.

To me, the demise -a mutation- of blogs started with the squawk box. Up to
that point, though it was a personal form, reading a blog I could always
assume that I could e-mail the writer when something drew me in to their
observations and he or she can respond or open it up to the blog if he or
she wanted to.
Or I could simply enjoy the blog. With the squawk blog that poetential has
been relegated to the basement. It created an upstairs and downstairs in the
structure of the blog. I, as a reader, could not feel that I was reading or
responding to a fellow writer. Since the squawk box was there, the blog
writer himself or herself also got released of the pressure of a direct
(though virtual) address. -"You cn leave the message with the maid." It is
this double structure of blogs, the "squawk" reminds me of "squaw,"
basically a put down slang- which changed its intimate nature for me, made
it less interesting.

always treat language like a dangerous toy

Can't resist - you were probably quoting me, Anselm

they use words like dangerous toys

Rumsfeld is one of my personal heroes. Read "Rumsfeld's War". He using =
the Delta Force Navy SEAL's to stamp out terrorism in every corner of =
the globe. He is policing the globe to protect us from nuclear-armed =
countries run by extremist clerics. Rumsfeld is also a proponent of the =
individual's rights to sexual orientation. He and Cheney and Rice are =
the real heroes of our times. Bush is listening to them. It doesn't =
matter if he himself is flawed. We are all. He is less flawed in fact =
then many people who post to this list. I wouldn't name names because I =
choose to take the high road, but ask yourself: would you want any of =
the diva poets or academicians on this list running our government. Of =
course not. That is why a great man like Bush is the head of our Nation =
and why diva poets read to cults at open mic's. It's child's play to be =
a diva and a prima dona poet or poetess and truly heroic to change the =
world.

"Cook in a cold climate" by Ian Smith

Picture his ship in Antarctic seas

sailing through the shadow that is night,

its wooden structure lit by lanterns,

icicles glimmering golden & the cold

the cold stabbing sailors to the bone,

ice cracking beneath a shooting star.

Now there is no turning back.

=20

One major collision with a ghostly shape

& they're all dead in minutes.

No flares, no life preservers

no radio to pick up a mayday call.

Not even a winner's cheque or tabloid story.

Those voyagers pass this night in history

seen & heard by no-one but each other

on the way to their own slow oblivion,

charting the eternal ocean bravely

singing chanteys to an old concertina,

husky notes sighing towards the stars

as the Earth continues to turn,

that silent whirring in the cold, pure dark.

All obvious comments but how much time is there in one
daily life for reading blogs, for writing blogs...I
see them as public diaries or journals...I write my
notes in private.
I only read Ron Silliman's & Cassie Lewis's blogs.And
I visit Steve Evans' factory.(I've been to the lime
tree too).But I don't have the time...I have a job, a
relationship, friends,family, books, tv, video, film,
concerts (Youssou N'Dour last night - fabulous),
theatre, movies, ferry rides, exercise, swimming,
watering a few plants around my block of flats..I have
websites, websites, websites. I have subscriptions to
magazines. I have this list...
I have to write some poetry too...

I see blogs as journals & poetry or literary ones as
texty versions of those early webcam diaries.

I don't really care which web form wins whatever it
is...I like this list even though I rarely enter the
discourse. I live in Australia & enjoy this
connection.

That's my two bob's, two cent's, five dollars,one
thousand rupees', two euros' worth on it..

I think this poem probably fails, ultimately--but since Rummy's on deck.
. . .

Sympathy for the Empire


          Aggressive fighting for the right is the noblest sport
          the world affords.
                --Teddy Roosevelt, quoted on Rumsfeld's desk


Sometimes old Rough Riders get kicked upstairs
to Kommissar. The music of the spheres

sounds a little fainter then, and we hear instead
the creaking of the machinery of heaven.

~

Why does the market swoon, dropping a hanky?
Investors have priced in a quick, successful war,

and if a hospital ship sails out of Baltimore
it must be filled, it cannot come home empty.

~

John Wayne, born Marion Michael Morrison,
is the gunslinger you want to harness lawlessness

in Shinbone. So the plaque on Rumsfeld's desk
is all about the noblest sport, the one you win

~

by being John Wayne, or just being _right_. But
it is a bunch of teenage privates in Kuwait

who have to spill out of their Bradleys
through the black smoke of live-fire exercise

~

as sand insinuates itself into night-vision eyes.
The desert is a sea of rocking, luminous green

as Rummy wields his dictaphone, white memos
drifting through the Pentagon like snow.

there are many images that flashes before our eyes, and it's hard to
put them all together... but there seems to be this on going subtle
hidden link, or maybe many links.. but a couple for me are troubling

one problem is most do not see *gay marriage* as a civil rights issues.
so,  the recent comments in congress about putting the *gay marriage
wild fires out,* makes sense, if it is a moral issues, those doing the
evil deeds are immoral, and as one columnist wrote, this is the second
front confronting amerika, the first being the terrorist, and both must
be stopped.

the second underling red flag is the recent announcement of segregated
schools, for *boys* and *girls*... which on the surface seems like a
good idea, since there is evidence of different learning styles, but
this idea further propagates a proper place for men, and a proper place
for woman, which is morally based, and social construct for, separate
but equal, based on some essence and or quality of character of gender.
  it is true there are learning differences between some, but it seems
to easy to segregate, instead of addressing the dynamics of teaching,
education and the social construct of gender.

so what we have is segregation, where the potential of enforced gender
stereotyping can take place, queerness crushed, and the institution of
marriage between a man(sic) and woman(sic) can take place in perfect
harmony, with everything in its proper place...

and do not kid your self.. this is set up to get the christian
conservatives and women's vote...


KEEP THE FIRES BUrNING

even if your note queer, grab someone (who looks like the same gender
as you) and go and try to get married.... do it in every-town and city..

David,

I don't remember the 1997 NBA finals--I do remember hating the Chicago Bulls
and hating Michael Jordan, but that's only because I grew up in Michigan and
had to be a Pistons fan.  But even my fandom didn't last until 1997.  In 1997 I
was a junior in high school, I turned 17 that August right before the start of
my senior year.  I was applying to colleges--actually, I only applied to one.
And I was accepted.  And then I didn't go.  I had to call the school a week
before classes were to start and tell them I wouldn't be going there.  I had
gotten a letter with my housing assignment, I was going to be living with four
other people in a room that was only meant for four people.  My brother had
told me not to worry--someone always drops out.  And that was me.  The
dropout.  It is one of those forking paths that I don't waste my time thinking
about--but what if I had gone?  What would my life be like?  There was a novel
I read this summer--and I don't remember the author's name write now--
called "D'Alembert's Priniciple: A Novel in Three Panels."  And one section
involved "the cosmography of Mangus Ferguson," who was supposed to be a
philosopher of sorts.  He didn't know whether it had been a dream or if he had
visited another planet, but he saw himself splitting and splitting into more
and more people each time a decision had to be made, so that one version of
himself followed out each possible outcome, and that version would eventually
split too.  Essentially the whole planet he was on was occupied by copies of
himself.  This knowledge only came to him because another version of himself
had written him a letter, and the version that was narrating the story, had
been in the position to read the letter.  Anyhow, I don't really care what my
life would have been like had a made a million other choices than the ones I
have made.  I'm pretty happy with where I am at now, pretty happy with the
individual I have become, and I know that I am who I am because of the
experiences I have had.

Anyhow, it is another beautiful day outside.  Of course, I'm on my way to work
right now: 1-9 today.  So by the time I get out it will be cold again and the
sun will be long gone.

Dear Gina,

A few days before Prozac led Abbie Hoffman to suicide in April 1989, he spoke
at Vanderbilt University. He talked about the battles that he waged in the
1960s against racism, poverty, and the vietnam war. He ended the speech, "We
were young, we were reckless, arrogant, silly, headstrong - and we were right.
I regret nothing." I went with Ian to the memorial they held at the old
Palladium night club on E.14th street--where NYU dorms now sit next to the P.C.
Richard appliance store. Inside the club they were handing out programs, with
pictures of ‘60s and ‘80s Abbie facing each other, and that quotation on the
reverse.

It's a simple sentiment, no regrets. I say I have no regrets, though I know I
do. But like you I know that all these choices, good and bad, have made me me,
and though at times I'm indifferent to me, I never hate me and I like the way I
treat people, even if I don't treat myself so nicely all the time.

*

saw my friend alan semerdjian play music tonight at a hippie cafe near my
parents' house. i don't tell anyone i'm going to attend their events anymore. I
always say I'm going to do my best to be there, if i say anything at all. i've
been disappointed too often by people who tell me they're coming to some of two
thousand events, the best always being the day-of call for directions and time
it's really starting and then not showing up priceless. nowadays when people
apologize to me for not making one of my events i simply tell them, "don't
worry about it. i throw so many events, the only person who should be at all of
them is me."

but this not telling people you're going to their events is also fun,
especially for the events that they wouldn't ever think you're going to. like
tonight at this hippie coffee house the cup in long island, i show up and alan
is all startle-excited to see me and he reaches out with his hand and pulls me
in for a hug. it's valentine's day and i'm alone but i'm not really thinking
about it, but here I am writing about it, so, okay, it was on my mind. but i
mean, i pay it no heed as i haven't been in love on this day since 1995, so i'm
used to it.

alan started the night with elvis costello's "alison," one of two songs I
played on permanent repeat for hours, for days right after first ex-gf did the
ex-ing of me. and the girl at the table next to mine asks if i know alan after
he and i head nod toward each other. "I'm Amy" she says, puts out her hand for
me to shake and the rest of the night she and I and her friend Beth are
talking, amy and i smiling at each other throughout the show. it's a nice tonic
on another night without love.

"what if I were Romeo in black jeans
what if I was Heathcliff, it's no myth
maybe she's just looking for
someone to dance with"

Joseph, I want this to be true.  At Naropa there was a fascinating
evening with John Cage at some point in the 70s.  It's documented in one
of the Naropa compendium volumes -- I think called Talking Poetics if
memory serves.  During one of Cage's silence pieces two people began
laughing.  Cage grew furious and admonished them.  Apparently he had
something that was HIS silence, and it didn't include gigglers.  I was
amazed by this -- how even silence can be somehow folded into a shape
that seemed like art, and another silence would not have any taste to
it, and would not be allowed.

This was to be CAGE's SILENCE, and not ours.

I don't think you can get rid of the ego, or whatever it is, the
imperialistic aspect of an individual, or even a class.  You have to
instead work with it.  For instance, in Haiti I don't think the right
idea is to ban the business class, or even to destroy them, but to
somehow get them to work in terms of a long-term selfishness, as opposed
to a short-term.  You can't root out the impure aspects of a person
without killing them.  The ugliness of a person is linked to their
beauty.  I don't know what this means in terms of a poetic community.
It's in everybody's long-term interest to try to create a community of
great poets, since poets only seem to come in rather large clumps --
they need to come as a group of say 10-15 poets, with three or four of
them as the best of the lot.  Great poets almost never arrive solo.
Perhaps the better poet clumps are thinking of themselves as
cooperative, along Brent Bechtel's thinking.

There has to be rivalry and sniping.  Even great boxers come in clumps
-- Foreman and Ali and Frazier -- the genius of one called to the genius
of the others.  This rivalry, as the rivalry among the Elizabethans, or
among the playwrights of Athens, has to be encouraged.  We need to
foster competition and meanness, as well as respect.  Or at least try
not to get rid of the meanness, and the petty ambition.

Great poetry, like a great city, has to begin with a basic instinct like
self-glorification and profit, but hopefully morph into something else.

Stung my eyes with smoke. Clinging to a hung of coral,
muddy, numb. That's me in the back among black
bandages, heated by my own decomposition. "They don't
remember my name there, but you push that yellow light
like slush through my cells, and now goddamnit it's
raining posies across my dick!" Tying it off, foaming
as the mouth moistens with moth thumbs. Om. Or saviors
too almost lose sullen followers to those wars of
sodden farmers at mulch with the chum. In early
thirteenth century Nova Scotia, serfs under rule spray
basic furrows with fish heads. They grew into moss the
way asimuth peppered your epigrams with a
condescending salt. I know you like this; you like it
in you. You're still leaving your footprints there, to
stale in snow so dark David Rounds has to fight to
read. Instead, I walk out to the old field, on ice
warm and still blushing, and almost tumble right into
the gash a new school left. "And here, where I learned
an early erasure, on Oberlin Avenue fat and acne'd and
in a black t-shirt, now churned under and gaping, now
these snow-laced walks are no part of me, now seperate
and objective like similes geld drives and lanes and
courts aching to be in New England." With a book of
xerox poems under my arm, taking them to John's
because there's a tinfoil fold of four hits of acid
between Chris Franke. "And the dead too curl their
toes in a frost they can't feel; they testify to your
dissolution, the way it ululates like telephones and
sacrament, the way they cascade unquiet through
tangled dreams; all the bubbles popping when they hit
the surface, bathwater brown. " You're going to blow.
At this moment, to preserve memory, this handhead
machine is rubbing its own boards with small doses of
charge. Are Sam and Mindy electric, as in what spark
of his makes her laugh? I fall low like buildings
growling to keep the houses in the suburbs busy. "A
link taster." You have to draw harder on joints. I
crack as I stand. Half an hour to go, and still ogling
the support of space empathizing around me. What a
shame. That hole in the street by the cemetary scares
me. She believes that the dead will return to feed on
us. Tearing apart warm strips of fried chicken;
breading crackles, and you hear in the room that salty
smack of nutrition. "Shesleeps off a sex hunger for
guns and rum. With a xerox book of prachment under
your arm. You just happen to know the arcs and
endearments of such shallow composition, as well as
mock wool when churches force mean annuals astride a
mop's throat. As she negotiates satiation, the
comforter rasps against unshaved legs. It is warm,
raw. A pride of harm. " Being an adult means not
killing those that hurt you. Tell yourself you'll
start again. Less selection tempts keeping an open
mind about bandaged gag reflections furnished athwart
rows of surplus cornice eventually. Towels. Lots
simmering beneath immersed and desperate sunshine. You
reel your hand there. Does play have a face? Her
clitoris sifts down your throat. Took and takes it, is
is is. I am a test-toyfor inanimate objects that fuck.

Subject:      Haiti

There is an excellent editorial in this morning's LA TIMES by Jeffrey D. Sachs,
titled "From His First Day in Office, Bush Was Ousting Aristide."  I wanted to
copy it to the list, but seem to be having a problem with my LA TIMES site
registration.  It's well worth a look.

In the meantime -- things we learned in Congress yesterday from Powell and
Noriega, who had declared "nonsense" the charges made against the
administration in this episode.

The administration testifies that they did in fact tell Aristide that they could
not and would not protect his life or the lives of his family from the rebels.
(note that upon his departure they immediately offered protection to a
successor.)

The administration acknowledges that they were aware of the criminal backgrounds
of the rebel leaders.

The administration has now acknowledged that they told Aristide they would not
help him exit the country unless and until he signed a letter of resignation.
(though Noriega went on to say that, despite having told Aristide this, they
"probably" would have rescued him anyway -- note that Aristide's wife is a US
Citizen, and that the stated purpose of the Marines in Haiti at that moment was
to "rescue" US citizens.)

The administration has now acknowledged that Aristide did not know where he was
being taken when he was put on the airplane. The administration acknowledges
that Aristide was not allowed to communicate with anybody at this point.  There
are reports that the US prevented his US-based security company from
reinforcing Aristide's protection detail -- the administration doesn't want to
address that issue, it would seem.

The administration offers no explanation for the large shipment of arms from the
US to the Dominican Republic during the time that the "rebels" were crossing
back into Haiti from their exile.

As one congressman asked repeatedly, how is this not a coup?  (I was glad, by
the way, to see a member of congress make public reference to a dictionary!  I
haven't seen that since back when congress was parsing the phrase "sexual
relations.") By any definition, this was not, as the White House still insists,
a peaceful, democratic & constitutional outcome.


favorite joke heard in this context:

Why has there never been a coup in the United States?

Because there's no U.S. Embassy here.

presents

poet Nathaniel Tarn
poet/artist Janet Rodney

Saturday, March 6, at 7pm
Dinnerware Gallery
210 N. Fourth Avenue
Admission $5; students $3

and
a discussion with Nathaniel Tarn
Sunday, March 7, at 2pm
at Dinnerware
Nathaniel Tarn writes: “One subject I am always interested in is the
question of simplicity/complexity in poetry and the sociological factors
involved in creating each. I am genuinely interested in peoples' ideas about
this so that an interactive seminar would be best for me.” An online copy of
Tarn’s essay “Regarding the Issue of ‘New Forms,’” which people might be
interested in looking at before the discussion, will be available on the pog
website. (Admission: $5; students $3)

Nathaniel Tarn: As poet, essayist, translator, and editor, Nathaniel Tarn
has published some twenty-five books, among them The Beautiful
Contradictions, Lyrics for the Bride of God, a Selected Poems: 1950-2000
published just over a year ago by Wesleyan, a celebrated translation of

George Schneeman: Painter Among Poets
A book party and reading to celebrate the publication of Painter Among
Poets: The Collaborative Art of George Schneeman (Granary Books), the first
retrospective presentation of the wide range of art works that Schneeman ha=
s
created with poets over the past thirty-five years. Painter Among Poets not
only investigates Schneeman=B9s enthusiasm for free-wheeling collaboration, i=
t
also considers his work as part of the remarkable modernist tradition of
poet/painter collaboration. Always open to spontaneity and engagement,
Schneeman encourages poets to contribute visual elements in order to create
surprising works that neither artist nor poet could have done alone. As
critic Carter Ratcliff, a poet himself, notes, =B3the Schneeman collaboration=
s
are completely unregulated, and they were carried out in free-flowing
situations where art and poetry were only part of what was going on.=B2
Painter Among Poets offers a behind-the-scenes look at the high-wire proces=
s
of collaboration as an outgrowth of Schneeman=B9s friendship with poets Bill
Berkson, Ted Berrigan, Michael Brownstein, Tom Clark, Edwin Denby, Larry
Fagin, Dick Gallup, Allen Ginsberg, Ted Greenwald, Steve Katz, Lewis
MacAdams, Alice Notley, Ron Padgett, Harris Schiff, Peter Schjeldahl, Tom
Veitch, Anne Waldman, Lewis Warsh, and many others. Twelve of Schneeman=B9s
collaborators have contributed personal commentaries and remembrances to th=
e
book, which also features an essay by Ratcliff, an extensive conversation
between Schneeman and Padgett, and a bibliography. Beautifully illustrated
with color and black-and-white reproductions, Painter Among Poets is an
exciting reflection of the beauty, adventure, and energy of the work it
documents. Readers to include Edmund Berrigan, Michael Brownstein, Larry
Fagin, Ted Greenwald, Steve Katz, Ron Padgett, and Lewis Warsh, with other
special guests TBA and a reception to follow.

Please read the following and if you agree with its message forward it =
to friends, and family members, and then elected officials--via local, =
state, and Federal Web sites.

The Bush Administration's crass appropriation of images depicting the =
aftermath of the events of Sept. 11, 2001 is at the least sickening and =
at the most truly frightening. That the Bush Administration would hold =
up images of this horrible event as evidence of the good job they are =
doing to protect the citizens of this great nation is quite frankly =
unfathomable. In this day and age, propaganda in an election year is to =
be expected, but the Bush Administration has gone too far. After George =
W. Bush's media cohorts' original claim that they would never stoop so =
low as to use these images to boost their political campaign, using fear =
and paranoia to frighten the American public--well they have done just =
that. The Bush Administration's original claim that using these images =
to serve their political agenda would be morally reprehensible =
underscores the fact that they are completely aware of their actions.=20

The Bush Administration cannot now claim ignorance or even claim that =
they are merely acting in good faith as defenders of our great nation. =
This cynical action exposes them for who they really are--ignorant =
purveyors of damaging propaganda that distorts and insults the memory of =
the innocent people that lost their lives that fateful day.

This is not a matter of Republicans and Democrats and partisan politics. =
This media campaign is morally reprehensible on a simply human level, =
nothing more and nothing less!

You can do something about this.

We ask that you merely pass this message along to all the people that =
you know--friends, acquaintances and relatives. Spread this message via =
e-mail or print it out and mail it. Send this message to elected =
officials at the local, state, and Federal level to show your extreme =
distaste for this act of theft, for these people have stolen the =
honorable memory of those that not only lost, but gave, their lives.

The Bush Administration has stolen the memory of the darkest day in =
American history--an attack on our soil--to further their own personal =
goals with the ultimate goal of perpetuating their personal financial =
gain.

What follows are two quotes from a major network, news source =
CBSNews.com

"It's a slap in the face of the murders of 3,000 people," Monica =
Gabrielle, whose husband died in the Twin Towers, told the New York =
Daily News for its Thursday edition. "It is unconscionable."

"It's as sick as people who stole things out of the place," said =
firefighter Tommy Fee. "The image of firefighters at ground zero should =
not be used for this stuff, for politics."

MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

Seems to me that self-glorification, which can be self-indulgent or its
opposite, is the big undefined term in this discussion. Any poetry that is
not somehow rooted in the self, in an engagement with selfhood and does not
through that engagement somehow glorify what it means to be a self/a human
being, would, it seems to me, ultimately be dehumanizing in the way that all
totalitarianisms are dehumanizing. Obviously that is not the same thing as
saying that all poetry must be involved in a narrative way with the minutiae
of the person who is writing it, but if poetry is not, like sex, an
exploration of our individual and collective embodied human being, then it
is not poetry. And along the same lines, but from a different source and
slightly different perspective:

   "Poetry can only be an exploration of ideology, not a means of expressing
belief in it. Reluctant to declare his ideology as the way out of
alienation, Youssef shows how his ideology, transmuted within poetry,
generates feelings of empathy and solidarity. For Youssef then, the
commitment to justice and freedom stand beside his poetry, not above it. His
political values, manifested in active participation in social struggle, are
in reality fulfilling his abiding devotion to beauty. Justice and compassion
in Youssef's verse are presented in a sensual manner that symbolizes his
individualized appreciation of harmony and balance. They are aesthetic
choices first and foremost."

Bush Administration?
i hope to have something else administered than bush.
the nation has suffered enough indigestion.

indignation!

have your next president packaged and delivered to your door in your
favorite format.
the doormat format.

bush would make a bristly one.

the question is whether wmd's should be sold over or under the counter.

over a year ago, i heard a computer expert spit on the electronic voting

so, i didn't see the ad, but upon hearing its description, i could not help
laughing: it's like rainbow icecream -- there you got a baby, here an old
woman, there a black person, here a nascar dad, there an oil rig, here a
fire-fighter, there a married couple, here a coupled martian, there a tree,
here a desert -- and in the background i hear a travelling salesman: "come
over here, potions for toothache, ointments for earwax, find your love,
prolong your life, grow new hair, lose your gray ones, the blind shall see,
the lame shall walk, come over here!"

images are the most powerful weapons.
tell your neighbor how to build a shelter.

The dump truck sneezed down the middle path
impaling the baker and the pharmaceutical rep

In breeding attire, tiny legs bent towards confidence -

Over experience's grasslands, inhabited by commas -

The decimal system gave us the green light
to originate the syrup of disastrous shag

Allowing craftsmen to hunt the typeface,
and bring home the slug with the spacebar.

MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="iso-8859-1"

I understand Kirby Olson's writing about self-glorification. I don't =
think Rumsfeld is self-glorifying though. He is selfless. A selfless =
worker. Boxers are not men whom I want to emulate and boxing is not a =
profession I want to compare the world of letters too. I think that John =
Cage's reaction at Naropa is funnier than his Silence piece.

Self-glorification worked in letters when letters was still =
"un-enlightened". There are still poets today who self-glorify their =
gender-preoccupations or their other preoccupations. Even poets who use =
markhov chains in their poetry. They are "Cyber-confessionalists" though =
they call themselves "codeworkers". But they are having a temper-tantrum =
and a self-glorification episode just as much as eminem has his.

I don't agree with Olson's collective/cooperative idea. Or clumps =
either.

Great writers and artists do arrive solo with some association with =
groups, but not to a very large degree. Groups like the Language Poets =
for example, are like tiny political parties that don't stand a chance, =
like Howard Dean. They are usually comprised of sour-grape people with a =
couple of pastors and a parish.

The greats do arrive solo. I know who the living greats are today. It's =
very easy for me to spot them out. I have an instinct for it. I know who =
the major and minor writers are. I know the difference between these =
writers and the "beaurocratic" types. I think we all know in our hearts =
who the major and minor writers and who the "beaurocratic" writers are.

Augie
btw:
My comments about Rumsfeld was not a joke and he is a VERY personal =
hero. So is Bill Gates and Arnold Schwarzenegger and Norman Schwarzkopf, =
Bill Clinton.

One person who is not a hero is Andy Warhol. His "mystique" is as =
"self-glorifying" as a Dennis Rodman.

I have "self-glorified" on this list with my marquee-like announcements =
on how many new volumes I have produced. This is just my way of trying =
to get attention. It's also a fun way to imitate the announcements I get =
from companies.

When "88: A Journal of Contemporary American Poetry" nominated me for =
the Pushcart Prize, I was filled with an ego-high. But it was really not =
self-glorifying. It was feeling validated by an editor (Ian Randall =
Wilson) whom I respect very highly. I know the Pushcart is very small in =
the grand scheme of things. And I feel a little embarrassed by all the =
announcements I sent out to friends when I was notified. But this is =
because I was feeling very validated. I was not self-glorifying myself.

Self-glorification is one of the basest human urges. Look at Beethoven. =
Self-Glorifying. That's why he is so boring after the first few bars. =
But then you take his "son" Brahms and his later "son" Elgar what do you =
get? With Brahms you get personal transcendence. With Elgar you get a =
visionary who composed more innovatively than you can imagine and whose =
spirit was devoted to the elevation of humankind. Beethoven was a =
Muhammed Ali. Boring.

Augie,
BTW:
I have produced 50,000 new volumes each 1,000 pages in length :)  Oh, =
and each one is a masterpiece. :0)

I'm sorry, Augie - I don't mean to diss your personal hero - but I am in
agreement with Henry Kissinger (!) on this one issue.  I look at the man and
I see a closed, self-interested, unprincipled ideologue who has done
irreparable harm in this world that my children are going to have to live
with for years.

He might work hard.  Ambition is a driving force for many people.  But he
seems far from heroic to me.  After all, he's quite happy to negotiate with
murderers if it's in his interests.

Not so keen on Bill Gates either, Microsoft programs are always giving me
trouble.

Arnie was great in Total Recall.

I live in a rather less masculine universe, where might does not equate to
right.

All the best

A

TOMBEAU
for L.

How can people exist without making?

Doesn't misery result from blockage of the normal human need to make?

Isn't it strange that most humans cease to make when they leave
childhood?

This was not the case in most post-industrial societies so it can
        scarcely be due to Evolution can it?

Perhaps Progress?

How about this for a scenario: making is the prolongation of play not
        the content of work.

Play & making constitute modes of production of meaning; "goods &
        services" signify as little to the maker as wages to the playing
        child.

The first gardens for example were not created to be work or even to
        produce food. They were experiments in making. Love affairs with
        certain meaningful plants such as hemp or grapes or tobacco.

School in the modern universal standardized institutional sense did
        not exist till the industrial age. Unlike old apprenticeship systems
        school teaches not making but work, or rather, it transforms the
        energies of making into the bound energies of work.

The model here was mind/body as steam engine. The more you bottle up
        energy, bind it & force it, the more efficient it becomes -- but also
        more destitute of complexity. The less complexity, the less meaning.

Replacement of steam engine model by computer model simply speeds up
        processes of machinization on psychic & physical levels:

machines take over production of meaning just as they take over
        material production -- or in the case of computers, control of the
        means of production (kybernetes, Greek for helmsman).

Production of meaning cannot be synthesized (rendered inorganic)
        without suppression on a social level of the desire to make.

In the crude early days of industry this programme was realized thru
        overt repression, control on brute physical level, fordism,
        time-clock, etc.

Here in the Future however control has gone covert & non-linear. It
        now operates directly on the imagination thru manipulation of
        simulacra.

As A.K. Coomaraswamy said, in our modern society the artist is a
        special kind of person whereas in a normal society every person is a
        special kind of artist.

The specialness of the artist consists of alienation, that is, a
        wound or lesion.

The artist refuses to give up playing -- the production of meaning --
        and thus also refuses domestication & "socialization" -- which are
        based on consumption of someone else's meaning, or rather, everyone
        else's meaning: the Consensus.

The artist is seen as an incomplete person, neotenic, one who has
        never grown up; thus is both despised & envied.

The artist will never be hurt, or rather, the artist is already hurt,
        otherwise would not be an artist.

This reality emerges very rapidly in the late 18th century as a kind
        of pre-echo of the Industrial Revolution; visionaries like Blake &
        Novalis suffer as Cassandras for their foresight.

The final revenge of the average modern non-artist on the artist is
        to turn art into a commodity & consume it.

In a Gift economy a made object cannot be alienated in this way, only
        given or received.

Under the sign of the Gift no one "makes a living" but simply lives;
        no separation between making & life.

Under the sign of money however the axe of separation cuts to the root:

money fills up with meaning while art loses it.

People feel art betrays them because it promises meaning but never
delivers.

But meaning lies in making not consuming.

Only a few great connoisseurs can really appreciate art without
        making it -- and in fact such appreciation is itself a kind of making.

And at some moment perhaps everyone has been a knower in this sense,
        deeply moved & even changed by some art they have made their own by
        understanding it,

understanding it by becoming it.

Everyone has at least one childhood memory of first-hand making.

Everyone has at least one moment of being an artist even if they're
        ashamed of it.

Hobbies are often repressed art urges.

Artists who realize this dilemma can try various ways to ease the pain:

for instance by giving away their art for nothing

by teaching other people how to get over repression & make things
        themselves (poesis)

by cultural sabotage -- art as negation & critique -- destruction as
        creation on both conceptual & physical levels -- attack the
        institutions

by keeping children out of school

by transforming work into play, e.g., by gardening in a festive &
        sensual manner

by embracing wordly failure as a sign of spiritual success

by "going out to greet the sabbath", by invoking St Monday, by
        slacking off, by praising revery & daydream against the slander of
        utilitarians & moralists

by founding a rural commune devoted to art & avant gardening -- or

by redemption, i.e., by taking on oneself the burden of misery of the
        non-artists, by being an Art Saint.

In short there are many things to do, things that might at least save
        yr own sanity

from disintegration burn-out under the good-cop/bad-cop routine of
        Late Late Capital

or even worse, assimilation, sell-out,

apotheosis of the Cyborg

without necessarily at the same time starving in a garret for want of
        food or recognition or even the company of friends.

Nevertheless sacrifices have to be made: one cannot simultaneously
        enjoy the conforts (however thin) or Capital & yet live as if the
        Revolution had already occured.

Some bets cannot be hedged. Play turns out to be quite serious --
        just as we suspected -- a matter of risk.

In a normal society it would take no courage to make, to create one's
        special kind of art.

Normal folk test their courage in other ways, say by vision quest, or
        by hunting dangerous game.

Like shamans artists are usually forced into it by spirits who won't
        let them rest unless they make art -- a kind of possession --

but it's always possible to appease at least some of these devils
        with a nice job in media or academia.

The result is of course self-repression & misery but many choose
        sickness with wealth over health with poverty.

In the U.S. the choice of affluence & distraction is made easy
        because the price in psychic misery is masked by false advertising &
        consciousness management.

It takes sheer foolhardiness to be an artist in the first place &
        then on top of it turn one's back deliberately on ArtWorld & retire
        to obscurity in some bohemian outback --

but the secret truth is that one year of dreamtime is worth ten of
        so-called self-appointed Real Life.

If more people knew this secret more & more people would take the
        risk until bit by bit the map would be erased
        & replaced by territory.

collected essays in literary and cultural criticism, Views from the Weaving
Mountain. He is the recipient of numerous awards including the Guinness
prize, the Wenner Gren fellowship, a Commonwealth of Pennsylvania
Fellowship, and a Rockefeller Foundation Fellowship.

Janet Rodney: poet, prose writer and visual artist Janet Rodney is the
author of Orphydice, Atitlan / Alashka (with Nathaniel Tarn), and the

David,

Well, I'm looking into applying for some grants, and some places won't
grant without the exemption.  Also, I'd like to be able to solicit
donations from people and have it be tax deductable for them.  I'm also
interested in creating an organization that would have somewhat of it's own
identity aside from me.  I'd like to make myself an employee of the Desert
City and get paid for the work I do.  (I didn't say my dreams were humble
(smile.))  I've recently begun putting together a board of advisors.

Other long term goals are adding some version of a publishing arm to the
series, maybe some sort of retreat something or other??  I'm not exactly
sure what I want to do, but I know that I want to keep expanding the work
the series does:  grass-roots promotion of avant-garde/experimental poetry
outside of an academic setting (I told you about my dreams, right? (smile.))

I admire the list you've put together over at the Saw -- I'm familiar with
many of the authors, but the only thing I've got (I think?) from your list
is the Stenhouse chapbook -- good stuff.  You are a non-prof??

So, at this point, I'm just trying to collect info -- I've heard the
application process is grueling and long.  I appreciate that you took the
time to respond.

Oh, speaking of Pavement Saw -- I'm always on the lookout for possible
readers.  If you have anybody in the area, or want to send somebody to the
area -- let me know.  We get good turn-outs and have a deal going with a
local bookstore for tabling purposes.  Thanks -- take care.

Ken

Aristide clearly wasn't playing ball.  Exactly what it was he was doing is probably
irrelevant, but he didn't understand the orders he was given.  In a way it's too bad
he couldn't have bent a little and tried to work with the foreign business people of
Haiti who have been calling the shots there for at least eighty years.  He's
probably Haiti's last best hope.  Now it's back into total misery for another
hundred years.  It did amaze me though when the Berlin wall fell, and when Duvalier
left.  It seems that just when you think nothing else more miserable could take
place, everything will shift.  I don't see what could possibly shift in the Haiti
equation to make things better -- with voodoo sorcerers running the island's smaller
towns and collecting blackmail from everyone -- with an almost completely illiterate
population -- with the police and army almost completely corrupt -- with a soaring
AIDS rate and women routinely raped by the powers that be -- and only a hand full of
students and intelligentsia and a little trickle of money from Protestant and
Catholic organizations -- it's hard to even imagine what could begin to make a real
change in that horrible mess.  Duvalier was so sick that he apparently chopped off
girls' clitorises and fried them for lunch.  How a place gets to be that completely
heavy is hard to fathom.  It would take at least a century of volunteers to put the
place on its feet.  -- Kirby

Richard, maybe it's "self" that needs to be defined.  That's a riddle -- the
whole problem of the subject -- and the many different takes on it.  Part of my
definition comes out of classical Lutheran theology --

"I am in bondage to sin and cannot free myself" which is how every service
opens, with the implication that even the most benevolent deeds are darkened by
self-ishness.  That in fact no deed can ever be accomplished without this
accompanying selfishness.

We haven't got any saints in the Lutheran tradition.  Luther didn't forbid them,
but he made it very clear that there aren't any.

What role of agency for good then do people get to play?

Basically, it's patience, I think.  And prayer.  Our real goal is simply
belief.  With belief, there might be the possibility of decency.  Without it,
none.  This is a heavy task, that I myself have been unable to achieve.  It's
probably impossible to achieve it, anyway, because it has to do with making
oneself into a receptacle.  So it's not a matter of achieving something.  It's a
matter of opening one's heart to a miracle.

But with good cheer, and lots of jokes.

I recognize that Marxists and other avant-garde types have believed that there
is a good group of people that will lead us out of misery into their version of
the New Jerusalem.  It seems to me that they always lead us into deeper misery,
precisely through this misunderstanding of the self.

I don't have any clue what the Islamic conception of the self would be.  Is your
poet a Sufi or Islamic?  I saw the former Cat Stevens on Finnish television
several times and he seemed to back the death sentence on Salman Rushdie.  I
think his new name is Youssef something, too.

Lutherans don't kill artists because we don't think they have any role to play
in salvation.  It would be like attacking a sewer worker, and asking him why his
work is always such shit.

I sometimes wish artists had a larger role in the Lutheran faith, and then again
I'm glad we don't.

This morning's Democracy Now had an excellent, long (maybe 1/2 hour?)
piece on Pedro Pietri -- with long extracts of him & others reading
from his work. A superb homage -- you can listen to it if you go to:

Ken,

What state are you in? Sorry if I missed this- there are ways to subvert
having your -own- 501c3 as you either hash out the details of how to do it
or wait for the app. to go through. It is not uncommon (in NY state at
least) for cultural organizations to enter into 'umbrella' type arrangements
with other fledgling organizations for the purposes of procuring funds and
tax-exempt donations.

Have you approached your local arts council? County or state? That might be
a good place to begin if you haven't already...

Not to make light of the passing of Pedro Pietri , but, in syn with the
ironic spirit of his great work, "Puerto Rican Obituary", I think he would
love the humorous (humus) combination of his "funeral plans" with his
"groundbreaking" poetry. Ouch!

Pink slips are stapled to the Bill of Rights -

Rubbing the belly of the barbed wire landlord;

Subject:      Reading ~Black Dog Songs~ by Lisa Jarnot
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

The praise for ~Black Dog Songs,~ and that it's listed
as one of the two top best-selling poetry titles at
SPDBooks, is well-deserved.  It's a singularly unique
reading experience.

I was reminded throughout of a poet I haven't yet
heard invoked in comparison: Edgar Allan Poe's poetry.
 It's probably not since his that we've seen a
consciousness combining such an oxymoronic, seemingly
mutually exclusive combustion: ear concentrated to an
Ulalume pitch, the political, and the sinister.

The most surprising moment came, for me, at the very
end, in the title poem, where all the book's themes
are suddenly noded into one and explained in a single
word, a point of synthesis I couldn't have foreseen:
the word "kill", appearing like a free-floating
disjunctive unconscious imperative in the mind of the
dog that's lullabied: "the foxes and / road kill all
wander / the highway / . . . / I know the road kill, /
the flies know the / road kill".   That, then, is both
the exhausting instinct that the poor dog has to be
lulled to sleep from ("Go to sleep little doggie") and
that explains---perhaps making more forgiveable in
their powerlessness against such deep-rooted
drives?---the George W, Bush, Dick Cheney, and Donald
Rumsfeld whom poems are dedicated to.  It isn't just
that the Colonel Sanders on the rotisseries ("The
chicken wing factory is lit up in flames"), in what
fast may be becoming the most-quoted poem of the early
21st century, are martyrs of pathetic victimization,
---except in some vegan utopia.  To the contrary: if
we didn't kill them, the dogs would.

I'm glad that the book is popular, but I'm surprised
that it isn't controversial.

The final, surprising black-&-white photograph that
follows the last poem makes explicit, perhaps in spite
of itself, a pathos that the poetry couldn't state:
it's all frozen over (the photo shows the walkway of a
pier leading out to its endpoint over a lake or bay,
the pier and the lake completely iced-over in winter
and the ice thick in several inches of snow), and the
reason that remained unstated was that ~so little was
or *can* be stated~ in a poetry like ours that has
been hyper-musicalized devoid of both propositional
statements and the risk of falsity and possibility of
truth that they hold ("for Dick Cheney": "dim dale /
ding dong / dip down / dame chase / cheap date / dance
dodge / do dick" [see "The Autobiography of Donald
Rumsfeld" by Anselm Berrigan, in Baffling Comubstions
# 2: "hand painfinite droolted / to vaguely
cutiepiefuzzfacesemble / who-ever's infinite drool
racket / suckinfinite droolg iced" (sic)]).
Historically, periods when literature reached ratios
of low semantics/high melopoeia were monarchic
imperialisms typified by the so-called "Decadent"
poets or, when the term was still value-neutral, the
French ~precieux~ poets.  Writing Degree Zero has
reached its sub-sub-zero Kelvin point in the must-read
~Black Dog Songs.~

When I first heard ~Black Dog Songs~ poems, before
reading the book, they "blew my mind" (cognitive
dissonance): there was an actual ~physical~ sensation,
a sort of tingling in my limbs, as my mind couldn't
solve their dilemma. I was most reminded of Robert
Ryman's all-white paintings.  Before reading the book,
I was more ambivalent or confused about Jarnot poetry.
 What shorted out all my receptive circuitry was that
the selfsame poems could simultaneously be read, as
Ron Silliman says, as an expression of one of the most
sensitive "ears" in American poetry and a distillation
of everything to the most ~pure~ possible of all
~poesie pure,~ an expression of great faith in
poetry--- ~or~ a hoax of the most cynical and taunting
type, there only to make fun of what's in vogue.  If
someone wanted to make a bad joke of poetry, it might
wind up a bad version of these good poems.  Without
outside context to corroborate its sincerity, a reader
could understandably be quite incredulous at the
Philip Glass minimalism of "Because the trees all
lived / there too.  Because the trees and roots knew
harmony.  / Because the burning cutters knew the trees
and hungered / for the crops.  Because the trees were
tired", in a poem with no less than ~twenty-two~
anaphora "Because" sentences ---which is reminiscent
of nothing so much as the typings of Robert Wilson's
(autistic) librettist Christopher Knowles (go to:

http://www.epc.buffalo.edu/sound/mp3/sp/dial_a_poem_poets/big_ego/05-wilson.mp3).


(The book could be compared and contrasted valuably to
another recent poet of repetition largely forgotten
from the canon: John Giorno.)

Afterwards, I found myself wondering at how the book
is triangulated among the bad father figures of a
wicked Bush-Cheney-Rumsfeld patriarchy and the good
innocence of lambs and animals or child-like nursery
rhyme allusions, but ~without any female figure~
whatsoever to complete that into a known feminism.

Initially, I was surprised when Ron Silliman praised
Jarnot's "ear."  I hadn't heard her writing that way.
And I wondered at how so wide a difference of
perspective could exist. From the sound of what he
says about his music-listening habits, Ron Silliman
seems like a New Age Steve Reich trance music type.
My listening habits are very different from that:
Boulez is the composer I think of first as the example
of a literal "perfect pitch" composer, and I tend to
think of "ear" as being demonstrated by ~variety,~ not
sameness.  Maybe, if that's the kind of music that he
looks to as a summit model of what's good, Silliman's
estimation would be understandable, I thought.  And,
of course, ~Black Dog Songs~ is reiterated sameness
~with slight variation,~ encouraging the reader to
attune more to subtle changes.

I had a friend who was in charge of book cover design
at a major publishing house, who spent his days doing
nothing but evaluating fine gradations of color and
who was ~professionally~ over-sensitize to it; and he
lived in an apartment where everything was white,
including the cats, and for a while he dressed in only
whites and off-whites.  Clear evidence of an acutely
heightened sensitivity can also be found in cases
where stimuli are then kept, defensively, at an
absolute minimum.

Maybe the proof of Jarnot's "ear" is to be found, the
way "kill" seemed to sum it all up, in a single word,
too: "dog", in the book's very title.  It took me a
while for it to dawn on me that, by singling out that
basic ABCs word to be writ large on the book's cover,
she had chosen one of the few words most equivocally
pronounced in English.  So evenly split is its
pronunciation, in fact, that the ~American Heritage
College Dictionary~ accounts for it with ~two~
pronunciations: either with a short o as in "box" or
with an aw sound (my regional prounciation) as in
"dawn."

The opening of John Ashbery's "The New Spirit" in
~Three Poems~ is often quoted: "I thought htat if I
could put it all down, that would be one way.  And
next the thought came to me that to leave all out
would be another, and truer, way."  Finally, here is
that heretofore only dreamt-of New Spirit poetry that
leaves almost everything out.

I'm very glad I read it, and I recommend ~Black Dog
Songs.~

> The visual thesaurus is a stunning work. Where did you find it?

Glad you & others are enjoying it, Gloria. I stumbled on it while googling
for a thesarus for the usual reasons, but I also have a special fondness
for thesauruses (thesauri?). A couple of years ago I was writing a number
of thesaurus-generated poems, a kind of translation in which I used as a
basis another poet's work, then looked up each word in the thesaurus to
generate a new text that resonated somehow with the original (since it
retains the syntactical structure of the original) and usually seemed to
engage in a conversation (sometimes an argument) with it. A time-consuming
but interesting experiment.

I am not sure how Rumsfeld is not a boxer, or whatever, but I guess the world of letters can stretch to the military but not to boxers, who are just goofing around when they are not biting other boxers' ears.  I wasn't sure if I understood that!

It's ok to glorify yourself I think, at least in art, and it is ok to form a nation-state and try to take over your art, too.  I only wish that Lutheran surrealism could accomplish this.  Every day I wake up and reach for the headlines, but it's the ketchup king and the dodo from Dallas, and not Luther and Breton holding hands and skipping down the wedding aisle.

If I was a pastor I think I'd talk this week about Haiti and how it is such a basket
case.  How nothing can save the place.  And meanwhile how the Virgin Islands
(Lutheran!) are such a startling example of everything perfect.

I would contrast that sleepy sloppy basketball player whose name I can't even
remember who started out with the Sonics and finished his lousy career with the
Clippers -- what was he -- 7'4" and couldn't get a rebound to save his life -- who
was from Haiti -- with the great basketball player Tim Duncan from the Virgin
Islands -- and how he can not only get rebounds, sink three-point shots, defend
Shaq, but doesn't care to brag, and is extremely reluctant even to speak to the
press.  Tim Duncan -- a lifelong Lutheran, who spends his weekends helping children
and arranging benefits for the less fortunate and is somewhat shy about his
greatness.

Fortunately, I am not a pastor, because I can't stand dealing with dying people
especially as they totally freak me out, and I threw up when I saw the movie Carrie,
and so probably won't go see the new Jesus movie, The Passion. What's with all the
blood and nails.  It's a movie for Billybob Briggs, and his buckets of blood.

I would prefer to see the quieter more joking and happy Jesus.  That's the one that
makes the Virgin Islands (Danish islands for a couple of centuries) go so
wonderfully.  And as for Haiti?  The voodoo.  This whole power trip of voodoo.  Give
a close relative to Baron Samedi and get power.  It just makes me want to throw up,
finally.  The more I think about it.  Haitian culture has made Haiti into a basket
case.

Thinking can easily lead to disaster, as Heidegger said.  A rotten religion can keep
a whole region in tatters.  It can doom an island to sorrow in perpetuity, in spite
of its fertile soil and decent climate.

We are so fortunate to have had Locke and the Anglicans, and the Congregationalists
in our background.  Whatever else one could say about them, they functioned.

Don't forget to check your tire's inflation as the weather gets warmer, speaking of
functionality.

It's perhaps America's fault that Haiti isn't more prosperous since we didn't trade
with them for a little long while, and then we did invade twice, and that can't have
been good for their self-esteem, but we weren't responsible for all 35 coups, or the
constant scene of rape and predatory behavior that goes on throughout the island.
We haven't zombified citizens, or spread AIDS through the island.  Sorrow in
sunlight.  Sorrow in sunlight.  Please pray for the Haitians.

Ken--

There are very few reasons for having a 501 c 3. Usually they are
regional.
There is a great benefit to having one and being in Minneapolis.
In New York there is no reason for one unless you make more than 25 G's
a
year. And so on.

Otherwise, there needs to be a specific reason. For example, 10 thousand

in confirmed funds, not anticipated, in which your sources have asked
for tax
donation papers and will submit next reporting period.

To choose a 501 c 3 status under the false assuption that it will bring
additional funding needs to be questioned. Strive for the funding first,
status can come if & when you need it.
Temporary status is easy to acquire if one of the above funding
situations occur.

We do have it by the way. But it was a necessary business decision.


Be well

The artist/writer is in the world like a rumsfeld or schwarzkopf. this =
is because of the nature of people in all walks of life. There are =
artist/writer types who are like terrorists or tyrant-dictated countries =
and marginalized liberal countries who although they have "good" =
intentions do not contribute to global stability and individual justice. =
Croggon made a good comment about Kissinger who is also a hero of mine. =
But Kissinger lived in a different time than now. We now have new =
technology to neutralize renegade countries or guerilla cells. Rumsfeld =
is doing in the miltary arena what Gates is about to launch in the =
online arena. I just received spam yesterday from the nederlands with an =
animated gif of a girl performing oral sex on a horse. It was explicit. =
I mean anatomically explicit and revolting. This is equivalent to what =
Rumsfeld is having to contend with. If he is guilty like Alison alleges =
of making deals with terroists then it is either unintentional or =
strategic (he is using them with the ultimate goal of eradicating them =
too by example)

There are poets like bernstein who think they can operate like a fidel =
castro or some other unenlightened individual. He recently told me he =
had no time to interview me. Then weeks later he asked me to publish in =
the MAG a third-party interview with him. I reminded him about the =
interview I requested of him and told him it was a two-way street. I do =
for you and you do for me. His reply was that i remove him from the MAG =
mailing list. The same third party who interviewed him has interviewed =
me too. He is from a middle-eastern country. Bernstein and Andrews and =
others like Jerome Rothenberg and Silliman all operate similarly. They =
behave like fools. They expect to be courted. Eileen Myles too. This =
only tells you how small they are. Silliman has a wife suffering from a =
chronic ailment for which I offered assistance with by referring him to =
my family's alternative health practitioner. Instead he rebuffed me by =
saying he had the expert in the nation treating his wife. Well then why =
has his wife not recovered for several years. My health practitioner =
treats this condition all the time with success. But he is not an =
"expert". All Silliman cares about is is blog and his 25th book. Well i =
have published 200,000 books and don't even count my visitors to the MAG =
anymore. And i still put my wife and daughter first.

I could go on. I have had encounters with untold types of people by =
being the editor of the MAG. I have had a very quick education about =
people.=20

I was thrown off Aaron Belz's list some months ago because he said I =
only "toot my horn". This may have truth to it, since i am a human being =
and a writer to boot, so i have a big ego to contend with, but what =
about Aaron himself? He is a prima donna and he did not want to share =
the stage. I also quoted leviticus in a post. This pushed his =
fundamentalist buttons.

I have also been kicked of alan sondheim's list after he had one of his =
psychotic breaks and projected onto me his own pathologies. I lost my =
temper for the first time ever (except for right now to a certain =
degree). Alan censored me and had me removed from the list. This is very =
ironic. But it's not the first time someone who has been persecuted =
himself then goes on to persecute another up and coming writer/artist =
who is threatening his fundamental world/writing views.

I think all these people including kari edwards should examine =
themselves, or rather get examined, since self-examination has not =
amounted to anything in their cases.

I have done more for writers in  less than two years than what =
Rothenberg has done in his whole lifetime. He put out one good anthology =
and that's it. What has he done for living writers to match me? Nothing =
whatsoever.

You Kirby and our common friend brent bechtel are probably one of the =
few people of this list with true integrity.

Do you want to know who is truly one of the greatest living writers on =
this list besides myself? Vernon Frazer. He is the only person who has =
put his neck out way out and discovered his greatness.

I post my material to this list to stir up people. No one has =
accomplished what I have in so short a time both in regards to the =
production of my own work and to the promotion of other writers.=20

Now I have to get back to my important work while most people are =
probably watching TV.

August Highland
btw
crag hill is also a writer to take very seriously - jeff harrison too. =
keep your eyes on them. also look at the writer in the new mini-MAG that =
just came out. These are 40 writers from all around the world. New York =
is like a old west ghost town in comparison to the writers i publish in =
the MAG and mini-MAG.

these writers and the "beaurocratic" types. I think we all know in our =
hearts who the major and minor writers and who the "beaurocratic" =
writers are.

from a longer series titled, LETTERS AT THE END OF A ROPE


Dear Donald,

There are those moments when you turn to the camera, in your role as the
more confrontational and acerbic Henry Kissenger, and sneer at the stupid
little idiot idea of America. For you echo a chorus arising out of the
Homeland, a ghoul of tactless undemocratic rage, that wishes to see itself
as the harbinger of worldwide elucidation.

For Americans feel in their dominion: cut off, impotent, harassed and
unheard-- their concerns adrift in the wind like so many scattered silent
daisy cutters. Your thankless task is to extend this anomie to the newly
conquered lands of Afghanistan and Iraq, and to shine in their eyes a
'culture of freedom' so bright they will be unable to see America=B9s other
hand. =20

As one who has spent a career embracing the means to an end, you are no
garden-variety psycho killer, but (alas!), an emblem that could not have
been better contrived.

Bush, Haiti & Venezuela: A Children's Tale


By Charlie Hardy,
Posted on Sat Mar 6th, 2004 at 10:28:38 PM EST


                         CARACAS, VENEZUELA, MARCH 6, 2004: There are three
very short words in Venezuela that often provoke smiles when they are
spoken: "No fui yo!" (It wasn't I).  They are heard when someone releases
gases from their stomach and doesn't want to own up to it.

 The March 1 edition of the Caracas daily, Ultimas Noticias, has a photo of
the ambassador of the United States to Haiti, Brian Foley, with his hands
open and an interesting look on his face.  I cannot see the words that are
coming out of his mouth but "no fui yo" would seem very suitable for the
moment.  And he would be speaking the truth.  He is only a part of the
machine that crushed Jean-Bertrand Aristide.[...]

> > > > Synopsis: The 12hr-ISBN-JPEG Project began December 30, 1994. A
`round-the-clock posting of sequenced hypermodern imagery from Brad Brace.
The hypermodern minimizes the familiar, the known, the recognizable; it
suspends identity, relations and history. This discourse, far from
determining the locus in which it speaks, is avoiding the ground on which
it could find support. It is trying to operate a decentering that leaves
no privilege to any center.


                       The 12-hour ISBN JPEG Project
                       -----------------------------
                          began December 30, 1994


  Pointless Hypermodern Imagery... posted/mailed every 12 hours... a
spectral, trajective alignment for the 00`s! A continuum of minimalist
masks in the face of catastrophe; conjuring up transformative metaphors
for the everyday... A poetic reversibility of exclusive events...

        A post-rhetorical, continuous, apparently random sequence of
imagery...  genuine gritty, greyscale...  corruptable, compact,
collectable and compelling convergence. The voluptuousness of the grey
imminence: the art of making the other disappear. Continual visual impact;
an optical drumming, sculpted in duration, on the endless present of the
Net.

  An extension of the printed ISBN-Book (0-9690745) series... critically
unassimilable... imagery is gradually acquired, selected and re-sequenced
over time...  ineluctable, vertiginous connections. The 12hr dialtone...

                   [ see http://www.eskimo.com/~bbrace/netcom/books.txt ]

KEYWORDS: >> Disconnected, disjunctive, distended, de-centered,
   de-composed, ambiguous, augmented, ambilavent, homogeneous, reckless...
>> Multi-faceted, oblique, obsessive, obscure, obdurate...
>> Promulgated, personal, permeable, prolonged, polymorphous, provocative,
   poetic, plural, perverse, potent, prophetic, pathological, pointless...
>> Emergent, evolving, eccentric, eclectic, egregious, exciting,
   entertaining, evasive, entropic, erotic, entrancing, enduring,
   expansive...

        Every 12 hours, another!...  view them, re-post `em, save `em,
trade `em, print `em, even publish them...

~ This interminable, relentless sequence of imagery began in earnest on
December 30, 1994. The basic structure of the project has been over
twenty-four years in the making. While the specific sequence of
photographs has been presently orchestrated for more than 12 years` worth
of 12-hour postings, I will undoubtedly be tempted to tweak the ongoing
publication with additional new interjected imagery. Each 12-hour posting
is like the turning of a page; providing ample time for reflection,
interruption, and assimilation.

projects and sources.

occasional commentary related to this project has been established at

This project has not received government art-subsidies. Some opportunities
still exist for financially assisting the publication of editions of large
(33x46") prints; perhaps (Iris giclees) inkjet duotones or extended-black
quadtones. Other supporters receive rare copies of the first three
web-offset printed ISBN-Books. Contributions and requests for
12hr-email-subscriptions, can also be made at
http://bbrace.laughingsquid.net/buy-into.html, or by mailed cheque/check:
$50/mo $500/yr. Art-institutions must pay for any images retained longer
than 12 hours.

This is a disturbing post.  The personal attacks and revelations of other
listmembers' personal tragedies seem beyond the boundaries of dialog --
let alone good taste.  While censorship is even more offensive, the First
Amendment should be alive and well -- here as well as elsewhere -- even
the First Amendment has limits bounded by self-censorship, discretion,
and truth.  If the attacks are based on verified truths, the choice to
publish them here seems questionable.  If the attacks are based on false
facts, surmise, or speculation, they could be slander, which is not
protected by anyone's free speech rights.

I don't think this was what Haas Bianchi had in mind when he suggested we
needed a good argument on the Poetics Listserv.  However, that is
speculation . . .

This is an inadequate response to a painful post.  I don't know
personally any of the people castigated in August Highland's post, but
almost all of them are people whose work I greatly admire.  I hope that
other Listservers will know better how to respond to something like this
-- and will also know whether any response at all is helpful.

Martha,

whenever I read a comments about censorship  I have to take note, and
since I never take the time to read the posts by August, I had to check
it out. I was more than saddened by the rage and contempt directed not
so much towards me, but towards those I know, and know their goodness
(I have never stayed at a place where I felt as welcome as I did with
Aaron Belz and family- what a wonderful sweet joy). I was also dismayed
at the attack about a personal matter, that obviously went on outside
the context of this list, between August and Ron Silliman concerning a
very personal issues to Ron.

and I agree, to bad mouth folks in public is at least in bad taste, but
this seems aggressive, mean spirited and vicious..

I think it is a pity.. that in a time like this of  national crisis, a
divisive diatribe has shown up and left a nasty residue...

Dear list-members,

In light of the increasing number of unacceptable *personal* attacks that
have been posted on the listserv over the last six to eight months the
listserv policy for flaming has been changed.

For the past couple of years we have made it clear in the welcome message
that flaming is not tolerated on the list and, to ensure that all
subscribers are clear about what flaming is and why we don't do it, it was
defined as any post which attacks "fellow listees or the list owners, also
messages designed to 'waste bandwidth' or cause the list to reach its daily
limit".  Flaming is now defined as any post that resembles a personal
attack or personal insult to anyone--subscriber or not--in any way at all.
This of course includes ad hominem arguments in which the person rather
than their work is attacked--in other words while critique of a person's
work is welcome(critical inquiry is one of the main functions of the list),
this critique cannot extend to a critique or criticism of the person.

I think most would agree that we cannot risk losing the listserv as a
productive communal space for discussion and announcements; as such,
subscribers who do not follow listserv policy on flaming will first receive
a warning from the listserv moderator and should they fail to follow policy
again they will immediately be placed on review.

These changes should not be surprising or oppressive in any way--they're
simply rules of decency and respect that ought to be extended to all at all
times.

If any of this is unclear in any way please do feel free to contact me.

All best,
Lori Emerson
listserv moderator

random splurtling impresssionistic:
a wonderful drive in gray weather, just cool enough, just early
enough (8 am on a saturday) for smooth interstate sailing.  i made it
in 3 hours or so, a bit longer, following miekal's directions.
dipping way into amish country in the hills and refuges of the
driftless grottoes supreme of southwestern wisconsin.  got to lyx's
house in lafarge ("right behind the hardware store on main street,
pretty straightforward") which was full of hippies making breakfast.
i went up stairs to look at lyx's last place of rest, her bedroom
with a single maternal-looking gourd on the sheets.  the gray and
white cat still sleeping on the chair, clearly missing her.  bright
things all over: hyacinths, daffodils, dried wondrous curly weeds,
handmade cards tacked to the wall, a large golden Buddha in the
corner, a low table spread with musical instruments, stringed
--another room full of wind instruments, many huge gourds that had
been turned into sax-like reed-axes...it's hard to cover as much
ground as i'd like, get down all the magical details of her space,
the delightful free-form tiling jobs, the red bathtub, her fabulous
shiny black lace-up boots still in her closet. i remember admiring
them once when she was wearing them and she said she'd gotten them
for a song at a thrift store, and today they were as shiny as they
were back then, maybe 5 years ago, as if she'd just polished them. i
love those boots, to me they are Lyx.  there were wondrous dress-up
clothes in the walk-in closet. i feasted my eyes (how's that for a
cliche) on all of the life-art art-life minutiae in every moment and
every corner.  in one room there was an enormous gilt and flowered
asian (japanese?) fan over the bed, like a protecting angel.
i went downstairs and there were some people knitting so i joined
them w/ my x-stitching. one guy also was danish and knew about danish
needle arts so that was fun.  there was an ojibwe lac de flambeau guy
there, nick hawkins, who later did a ceremony with tobacco and
prayers.  boa, who co-owned the house w/ lyx, had asked him to come
down.  boa was wearing a pink and purple knit hat.  everyone was
wearing imaginative and colorful clothing.  but nothing like what was
to come.  kids and grownups with clown make-up and wild clothing,
mylar kites, wind and percussion instruments galore, party clothes in
the finest anarcho-hippie tradition, a whole row of us carrying
dijeridoos --trumpet, trombone, sax, and gourd (played by miekal);
lots of videographers running alongside and among all the paraders.
Zon whom i hadn't seen in years has shot up and is a handsome young
man with a lot of presence. he was wearing a red velveteen jacket and
camouflage fatigues.  i guess he was exhausted from recent events and
from djing a audio-wake for his mother the last few days but he was
very in control of events and showed a lot of leadership, just like
his mother.  a lot of kids and dogs were there. the kids were of all
ages. some were wearing bright colored bathrobes of plushy material.
we walked en masse a few miles to a beautiful stark park and boa had
lyx's ashes in a gourd she had made.  we each took some ashes, they
were a lot darker and more bitter-tasting than my uncle al's from a
few years ago --and we scattered them about, into the kickapoo river,
which was flowing very swiftly under a wooden bridge a lot of us
stood on.  i was most touched when miekal first emptied his hand of
the ashes, then took a bell off from the string of bells around his
neck and dropped it into the river and finally took his magnificent
gourd-sax and hurled it into the river as well.  there was drumming
the whole time.  then nick hawkins had us each take some tobacco from
his beaded pouch with our left hands (closer to the heart), put some
back on a cloth that he was going to take back up to the lac de
flambeau rez, then we sprinkled the remaining tobacco around --i
dropped mine back into the river, and looked to see if the gourd-sax
had caught on a snag downstream --i think i saw it; i could hardly
bear the idea of it just drifing somewhere to get caught and rot, but
i guess that is my limitation as a hoarder.
then allegra had us gather in a circle and people said things about
lyx, or played instruments (a brilliant androgynous saxophonist did
something cool) and zon and miekal both spoke as did many others in
their bright garb and joyous mien.  her yoga teacher was there. he
sang a song, mama shu something.  we tried to sing along.  we sang
some other stuff and struck some yoga poses. after a few hours we
went back to the house and then went to the community center down the
block for a dinner.  camille had made wonderful traditional romanian
funeral food, a combination of wheatberries, honey, walnuts and a bit
of chocolate chips.  walnuts stood for the threshold between life and
death, wheatberries for i can't remember, honey for lyx's qualities
and values in this life. we each tasted it and thought of lyx.  it
was in the basement of the community center with long tables and
folding chairs.  it was a very community-ish feeling.  i saw some
folks i recognized from brief trips to dreamtime over the years.  I
am not really a part of the community but a fellow-traveler of sorts
but people were very nice and lyx was an obvious topic of
conversation.  lyx was an extraordinary person and everybody
recognized it and acknowledged it.  she is still.  it seemed a little
strange not to have her there but i guess that's what it was all
about.  whenever i am given the ashes of a person i try to ingest
just a tiny bit. i guess that is called anthropophagy and is a very
common mourning rite, or at least allen ginsberg told me that when i
asked him about it in 1996, a few months before i met miekal and lyx
and embraced dreamtime and xexoxial into my world.  there was going
to be a party at dreamtime later but i hit the road so i could sleep
in my own bed instead of going to the bed and breakfast i'd planned
on.  so now i'm home after the 3.5 hour drive listening to all kinds
of wonderful People's Music on the radio. It was snowing and blowing
but i was very warm, a bit too warm, had to keep opening the window.
sweet dreams, lyx and everybody.

        George - glad to see you incarnate the precept - working day and night =
for Canadian culture - because I hadn't known of the existence of the =
Toronto South Asian Review and will look them up. I forwarded an =
announcement without editing copy, but let me revise those words =
nonetheless: Catamaran is America's first literary journal devoted =
exclusively to South Asian literature. The inaugural issue features a =
restropsective on Agha Shahid Ali, among other reviews, poems, essays =
and stories <http://www.catamaranmagazine.com>. In fact, the editors of =
both journals should consolidate energies in conversation. There's a =
real need to celebrate such work as the recent closure of the Asian =
American Writers Workshop (having just celebrated ten years of =
existence) reminds us. =20

Everyone probably has something against someone else in the writing world,
dislikes certain personalities, and who knows, might even completely detest
some other writers. Normally, these opinions are not shared. August is
presenting thoughts that are in his head, silent, bouncing around in there
someplace - sentiments that other would likely feel, not towards these
specific individuals, but probably towards someone.

It would be interesting to give out a truth serum and have people write what
they actually think - a huge flame war would probably result, which wouldn't
be good for the whole concept of "shared space" in an Internet forum, but
people would have a lot to say.

Mmm. I don't have any grudges against anyone on Poetics. But who knows?
Maybe some people hate my guts.

There goes my external, detached analysis.

Sincerely,
Brent

Hi Maria, I assume this was from you?

At the moment I'm using a program on my linux pda, Calculon, which allows
graphic math plotting; it extends to 4 dimensions by creating a sliding
rotation along the w-x axis, and I'm fascinated by this. I want to make
some short films using this and working with spherical shapes. I'm also
trying to decide where to go with my performance work; I have an idea
using a Chinese scholar's stone I have. Another direction - my good
shakuhachi will be coming back from repair, and I want to do some serious
practice/recording with it, also combining it with my old Mirage sampler.
Ellen Zweig and I are still stumbling through the classical Chinese of the
1000 Char. essay. In terms of writing, I'm still stumbling as usual among
codework theory, the nature of code, etc. I still find the idea of
symbolic enframing enormously difficult, in part because of its already
theoretical overdetermination with little neurophysiology to back it. But
I'm crawling through some debris or other.

In terms of the recent flaming, one can always use a kill file to keep one
sane; I do. But I do agree that flaming has no place on a list, which is
already a delicate organism, and needs tending and cultivation. A list can
collapse very quicky through spiteful attacks - the communality of a list
is worth far more than that.

- Alan

I'm preparing for publication two new mss: one, a new book of poems to be
called SHARDS (for Marsh Hawk Press), and the other, a book of published literary
criticism to be called MEANING, EXTENDED (for Textos Books).

Sincerely

Dear List,

Yesterday it came to my attention that there's this phenomenal little used book store in the Hampden section of Baltimore. I talked to the owner, who is very interested in doing readings and lectures out of the back of the store and also in carrying our books (furniture press). the thing is, he needs to punch a hole in the wall in the rear of the room so there's a fire escape, and he needs cash to do it.

What i suggested was that i'd definately help him clean up the back of the store and possibly give him some cash 'cause he's interested in my help with the readings. the press is looking for a venue and this is the best possible spot because it's in the middle of the merchants district and the artists and some galleries are posited all over.

this guy needs 5-6 hundred bucks, and what i told him i could do was sell some of my books to raise some cash. or i could ask around and see if anyone would be willing to give help or suggest someone who could do it for cheap, as a gesture, and this person would get a handsome 'thank you'.

in the meantime, i'm putting this up to see exactly who is in the baltimore or surrounding area who could put in a little effort (either by donating time, ideas or cash). i'm putting up my catalogue and some of the cash from sales will go towards making this space 'readable'.

thanks for reading. please go to

www.towson.edu/~cacasama/furniture/poae

if you'd like to check out the catalogue. nico vassilakis' pamphlet is ready and donna kuhn's forthcoming chap will be ready by this weekend.

any queries please contact me.

thanks,

Christophe Casamassima

I am happy about the new policy on flaming.  I hope this post does not
violate it.

I feel I have to say something just because August stomped on people
mercilessly, and I think the victims will feel better if neutral parties
come to their defense.  I was particularly upset by the references to
Silliman, Alan, and kari edwards.  I have a chronic illness myself and have
been mightily hurt by people who think they can cure me through some
idiosyncratic alternative method.  It is bad enough to be sick or to have a
sick relative, but when people accuse you of doing it to yourself by failing
to take their advice -- whatever the value of said advice -- it can be
devastating.  I don't know Ron Silliman personally, but I know his work and
blog, and I respect both greatly.

On the other hand, I know Alan somewhat and I have never found him to be in
the slightest bit vindictive.  I don't know if or why he kicked August off
his list, but I doubt it was a personal attack.  And to accuse someone of
psychosis and projection is indecent. Moreover, some of my best friends are
psychotic :-)  Psychosis is a sign of serious illness rather than a dirty
epithet to foist on your enemies, and I think it is rude to use the word as
August did from the point of view of tolerating people with psychiatric
disabilities, as well as for the obvious reason that it is was all but
certainly *untrue* and was not nice.  Alan has been supportive of my work in
web art, as he has of many others on webartery and other lists, and he has
worked with dozens of people successfully.  To attack someone who has done
so much to further the careers of other people in the arts makes no sense.

The thing about kari was really unspeakable.  I won't say more.

I don't mean to make this continue by bringing up August's specific points,
but coming to people's defense is not arguing, it's support.

Millie

The artist/writer is in the world like a rumsfeld or schwarzkopf. this is
because of the nature of people in all walks of life. There are
artist/writer types who are like terrorists or tyrant-dictated countries and
marginalized liberal countries who although they have "good" intentions do
not contribute to global stability and individual justice. Croggon made a
good comment about Kissinger who is also a hero of mine. But Kissinger lived
in a different time than now. We now have new technology to neutralize
renegade countries or guerilla cells. Rumsfeld is doing in the miltary arena
what Gates is about to launch in the online arena. I just received spam
yesterday from the nederlands with an animated gif of a girl performing oral
sex on a horse. It was explicit. I mean anatomically explicit and revolting.
This is equivalent to what Rumsfeld is having to contend with. If he is
guilty like Alison alleges of making deals with terroists then it is either
unintentional or strategic (he is using them with the ultimate goal of
eradicating them too by example)

There are poets like bernstein who think they can operate like a fidel
castro or some other unenlightened individual. He recently told me he had no
time to interview me. Then weeks later he asked me to publish in the MAG a
third-party interview with him. I reminded him about the interview I
requested of him and told him it was a two-way street. I do for you and you
do for me. His reply was that i remove him from the MAG mailing list. The
same third party who interviewed him has interviewed me too. He is from a
middle-eastern country. Bernstein and Andrews and others like Jerome
Rothenberg and Silliman all operate similarly. They behave like fools. They
expect to be courted. Eileen Myles too. This only tells you how small they
are. Silliman has a wife suffering from a chronic ailment for which I
offered assistance with by referring him to my family's alternative health
practitioner. Instead he rebuffed me by saying he had the expert in the
nation treating his wife. Well then why has his wife not recovered for
several years. My health practitioner treats this condition all the time
with success. But he is not an "expert". All Silliman cares about is is blog
and his 25th book. Well i have published 200,000 books and don't even count
my visitors to the MAG anymore. And i still put my wife and daughter first.

I could go on. I have had encounters with untold types of people by being
the editor of the MAG. I have had a very quick education about people.

I was thrown off Aaron Belz's list some months ago because he said I only
"toot my horn". This may have truth to it, since i am a human being and a
writer to boot, so i have a big ego to contend with, but what about Aaron
himself? He is a prima donna and he did not want to share the stage. I also
quoted leviticus in a post. This pushed his fundamentalist buttons.

I have also been kicked of alan sondheim's list after he had one of his
psychotic breaks and projected onto me his own pathologies. I lost my temper
for the first time ever (except for right now to a certain degree). Alan
censored me and had me removed from the list. This is very ironic. But it's
not the first time someone who has been persecuted himself then goes on to
persecute another up and coming writer/artist who is threatening his
fundamental world/writing views.

I think all these people including kari edwards should examine themselves,
or rather get examined, since self-examination has not amounted to anything
in their cases.

I have done more for writers in  less than two years than what Rothenberg
has done in his whole lifetime. He put out one good anthology and that's it.
What has he done for living writers to match me? Nothing whatsoever.

You Kirby and our common friend brent bechtel are probably one of the few
people of this list with true integrity.

Do you want to know who is truly one of the greatest living writers on this
list besides myself? Vernon Frazer. He is the only person who has put his
neck out way out and discovered his greatness.

I post my material to this list to stir up people. No one has accomplished
what I have in so short a time both in regards to the production of my own
work and to the promotion of other writers.

Now I have to get back to my important work while most people are probably
watching TV.

August Highland
btw
crag hill is also a writer to take very seriously - jeff harrison too. keep
your eyes on them. also look at the writer in the new mini-MAG that just
came out. These are 40 writers from all around the world. New York is like a
old west ghost town in comparison to the writers i publish in the MAG and
mini-MAG.

  August, this is the first input I've gotten from you that I myself have
understood.  I am not sure how Rumsfeld is not a boxer, or whatever, but I
guess the world of letters can stretch to the military but not to boxers,
who are just goofing around when they are not biting other boxers' ears.  I
wasn't sure if I understood that!

  It's ok to glorify yourself I think, at least in art, and it is ok to form
a nation-state and try to take over your art, too.  I only wish that
Lutheran surrealism could accomplish this.  Every day I wake up and reach
for the headlines, but it's the ketchup king and the dodo from Dallas, and
not Luther and Breton holding hands and skipping down the wedding aisle.

  We must live in hope.

  Best,

Anastasios, the situation in Haiti is bizarre, and it's clear that our
administration let Aristide crumble.  But are you saying that you want a U.S.
military intervention?

It's the only thing that could have saved him.

Exactly what is going on there is still unknown.  It is quite clear that
Aristide was not playing ball with the business elite, and they wanted him out.

But how do you think Haiti could ever turn its fate around?  I'd like to deal
with the larger issues not just of who is immediately responsible for this
atrocious turn of events, but what solution could possibly be found.  Very high
illiteracy, very high AIDS rate, the top soil is disappearing at an amazing
rate, an almost totally corrupt upper class, a political system that has
seemingly never worked, an endemic religious culture that is completely
predatory and vicious beyond belief -- zombification -- which turns a person
into a member of the living dead, mostly foreign-owned businesses that pay no
taxes but pay bribes to the leadership.  How can anything change when so much
is against this country?  The country has to be totally redesigned from the
ground up if it is going to function. The vast majority of the peopl of Haiti
are descendents of the former nation of Dahomey, which was itself no picnic.
Mountains of skulls made the superstructure of one ancient palace, and the same
voodoo business, the same gods, are still in place there.

There is the probability or at least possibility that 100 years of US and
French embargo more or less destroyed Haiti's capability of becoming one of the
brighter nations of the Caribbean.  What was done to Germany accomplished that
in a couple of decades after WWI, and perhaps this is part of it.  But I wonder
what's to be done, and why what is done there is always already a disaster.
The other half of the island is no picnic either but by comparison to Haiti
it's quite functional.

But Anastasios -- what you seem to be arguing is for military intervention, and
your links were also seemingly full of people who really wanted a military
intervention.  The alternative to that, was doing nothing, and letting Aristide
get slaughtered.  The US seems to have at least saved Aristide.  Do Bush and
his people intend to put him back in after brokering another United Nations
type of coalition, which is what everybody on the left seemed to want in Iraq?

Meanwhile, a lot of necks are going to find a machete.  And in this morning's
paper, it said that BABY DOC DUVALIER yearns to return to Haiti from his exile
in Miami. Just as Idi Amin no doubted yearned to get back in the saddle in
Uganda.  Short of a military intervention, this is never going to happen.  And
it would have to be a military intervention followed by thirty or forty years
of permanent peacekeeping, with educational initiatives, and such massive
changes that probably no relativist would be able to accept it.

I am glad to help, and glad to see the revision, but maybe you should
say not "America's" but rather "in the US." There are many people in
America who do not like it when people in the US call their country
that. Of course we dont like hearing the US basketball champions

August!  It is nice to have you and Harry Nudel say nice things about me.=
 It was refreshing even.  But I guess I would say that listserv owners at=
 this board have been quite gracious with me.  In spite of my being an an=
ti-Marxist Christian liberal pushing a Lutheran surrealist aesthetic, nob=
ody's told me to cork it.  In fact, my politics are about as stable as so=
me people's sexual identity, and yet nobody's kicked me off.  Bernstein h=
as been gracious to me via backchannel, as has Silliman, and Aaron Belz a=
nd I -- sometimes I think he's me I like him so much.  Kari Edwards has b=
een very nice to me, and so has Alan Sondheim and everybody else you've m=
entioned.  In spite of the fact of our very different thinking, I think i=
t is possible to say just about what you want on this board, although I w=
ouldn't get excited and think you might change anybody's mind.  I've neve=
r changed anybody's mind, and if I did, I would probably change my mind t=
o the other person's former beliefs in order to keep the argument going. =
 Was it you, or was it the charming Harry Nudel who said that I had commo=
n sense?  This is something that nobody's ever attributed to me -- not my=
 mother even (this was the basis of her list of calumnious charges agains=
t me, as I recall), so it was extremely pleasant to hear this.  My mom an=
d I get along
famously now, but she would still probably not grant common sense as my m=
ost foregrounded quality. Her nickname for me as a boy was Colonel Quack!=


Tyranny is when all the power's in one person, or in one faction's, hands=
 -- that's a paraphrase of Madison.

In art generally, and on this board, that's never going to be the case.  =
We will all vanish, and new people will take over, and most of us will th=
en go to heaven and continue our discussions in the Nude Jerusalem.  Mean=
while, we can have fun here, I think.  Just don't expect anything (you've=

hich I offered assistance with by referring him to my family's alternativ=

 in the nation treating his wife. Well then why has his wife not recovere=
d for several years. My health practitioner treats this condition all the=
 time with success. But he is not an "expert". All Silliman cares about i=
s is blog and his 25th book. Well i have published 200,000 books and don'=

Honestly, you children.

I was told a marvellous joke today by a non-poet friend. It goes like this:

a woman goes to a butcher's shop in search of a marvellous treat for her
husband's sixtieth birthday party. 'What he wants', she explains, 'is the
most expensive food item you have - money is no object.'.

The butcher ponders her for a moment and then says: 'Well, it's brains'.

'Brains', she says 'how much do they cost?'.

'Well,' he says, looking under the counter, 'I can give you one English
poundsworth per Imperial measure per pound, that is £'s per lbs, for
politician's brains.'

'H'm,' she says, ' that doesn't sound very expensive.'

The butcher gains confidence - 'I can do you engineer's brains at £2000 per
lb.'.

'That sounds better,' says the woman, 'but do you do anything more
expensive? My husband wants the best, the costliest. What is the most
expensive you have'

'Ok' says the butcher, reluctantly realising there is a real sale on, he's a
capitalist but has always felt slightly guilty about it:

'There's poets brains'.

'How much?' says the woman.

'£2,000,000 per lb.'

'What' says the woman 'how come so much?'

The butcher looks at her. 'Do you realise' he says' just how many poets we
have to kill to find a pound of brain cells?'.


Best

Kirby, we have a colicky 8-week old screaming his head off, and I cannot get
into a protracted debate with you like we did over on Aaron's list.

Here's where we differ. You have faith that a US militaristic/diplomatic
intervention will do good there.

You seem to think that Aristide had to play with US corporations and that all
Haitian wealth is corrupt. I know a good number of Haitian people who could be
considered wealthy but were also very large supporters of Aristide, Lavalas,
and long time populists who have worked through their lives to fight the deep
seated corruption in Haiti. You think that the US will improve the literacy
rate in Haiti when GWB has gutted Leave No Child Behind? You think that the US
will improve the HIV problem in Haiti when Bush wanted to kill his AIDS bill
the day after he proposed it in his State of the Union? The first installment
of $285M of that $15B was decided upon this past week -- nearly 13 months after
the fact. It will be going towards abstention programs and other issues, but it
cannot be used to buy cheaper generic AIDS medicines. In short, our money which
will go to Africa's AIDS sufferers must be used to enrich GWB's friends on the
pharmaceutical boards. And, you and I can go on for hours and hours about this.

I would have liked to have seen an international peacekeeping force go in
before the Haitian situation reached it's tipping point in order to keep a
democratically elected government in place.

Your Lutheran Dadaism seems to fall on the side of good faith. In the face of
overwhelming evidence, you seem to think that US government is overwhelmingly
good. In some ways, you position is downright Marxian but you substitute US
government for individuals.

You will rebut, but I cannot. There's too much to deal with right now to be
able to get into this debate right now. I average 1.5 hours of sleep per night,
and I can barely keep it together.

We disagree on our starting points. You seem to believe that the US will do
some good in Haiti, but I do not believe the people of Haiti will benefit from
Aristide's removal or -- let's get honest with this thing. Let's call a spade a
spade, eh? From this US backed coup.

I'm not entirely clear about why the revised policy is necessary, as opposed to
stricter enforecement of the existing policy -- but then, there may be things I
am not aware of, as I have a tendency to delete messages that appear to be
flames without reading all the way through them --

but I worry about an absolute ban on any ad hominem argument about any person,
on or off the list -- Not that I favor ad hominem, but I worry that it may some
times be in the eye of the beholder . . . and I really worry about a policy
banning anything taken as a personal insult to anybody anywhere (and does this
include historical figures?  Can I insult Vachel Lindsay?)

Aldon Neilson writes, anent Lori's new policy on flaming:
    Can I insult Vachel Lindsay?

(What: & have the webmaster cast you "down, down with the Devil"?)

I agree with you, Aldon, that Lori's strictures--though born, no doubt, of
laudable impulses--may in pratice go too far in the direction of
thought-policing. Surely,
viciousness has no place in civil discourse, but why ban the jibe, the snide
remark, the blaming by faint praise, the laugh at the laughable? In a medium
so deaf to irony, many still attempt it; should they languish in the gulag
of "review"? (Think: Lenny Bruce.)

In an art that spawns such threads as the present one on
"self-glorification," and which in some quarters leads writers to strive for
an unmistakably personal "voice," it may often prove difficult to tell "the
dancer from the dance" and thus to distinguish an attack on the work from
one on the person. But does thinning of the skin produce osteoporosis of the
backbone?

Shouting matches, of course, can quickly grow tedious, as can the tedious
cavilling of 'gotcha' logicians that periodically herpifies various lists to
which I subscribe. Still, a preemptive 'three monkeys' defense against such

Downing 3/4/04

Not a door’s shadow but the shadow of a door
Diligence is a mechanized vocabulary

The shadow was crazy different
Exuberance I won’t name your flowing hate a simple ego
Every place is down here
Transparent mites cover the page covering us
Is this learning hunger a house


Pianoing 3/6/04

Gimme gimme pelican architecture
The shape of the forest is not the forest
Ruined as a thin river in a photograph
Mistaken for a painting of your face
Happy ink unabridged us a machine
Things happen in lines, windows, flakes
A bit of ivy slows a yellow wall
A signature a walking bird makes music of
To keep repeating with one color its name
Yellow hammer yellow hammer yellow hammer

Noah,

I enjoyed the 10 line poems you posted, and I'm curious about your 100 poems
in 100 days project--I've tried similar projects, and they always fizzle. Are
you using any particular generation, revision or cut-up strategies--or any
other self-imposed strictures? I'd love to hear a little more about it. Feel
free to backchannel, if you'd prefer.

(By the way, we haven't met but I'm a co-editor for Near South, which had the
privilege of publishing some of your frank and charming frequencies last
year.)

thanks much,
Kristy Odelius

hey maria,

i know you, and some others, know of the many postcard projects i've done
with sean cole, the two most recent of those being this past october, when
we each mailed one another a posctard a day for the entire month. i also
used a different piece of cardboard for each of the first 30 days of the
project, everything from a coltrane lp back (to "my favorite things"), a box
from pair of donna karan boots, even an immodium box i found in the trash at
my building.

in december sean did his third straight december project, sending me a
postcard a day for the entire month. and these will be made into the first
boog single author book, due, u guessed it, this coming december.

last month, gina myers and i emailed each other a letter a day for the
entire month, her usually writing in afternoons and early evenings, and me
replying late at night, ending up with 58 letters in all, including two we
wrote on leap year day, and put into our The February Project book, in time
for a reading later that day.

For this month, march, i wanted to continue my usual nighttime writing,
doing so with no constraints. But then my mom got sick and i started writing
these one thought short poems that begin with dear mom, where i take myself
as far away from the poem as possible, other than being the observer
reporting the news/poem.

also, i work with the poet erica kaufman, and we're planning on
collaborating on poems over yahoo messenger, and then editing them during
lunch.

and that's my me as poet projects.

there are always the boog projects:

each month an issue of boog city, as we gear up toward our Republican
National Convention coverage for the august and september issues of the
paper.

new boog reader pamphlet from Jordan Davis.

the d.a. levy lives: celebrating the renegade press in america series
finishes its first season in july, with readings the next few months by
Braincase Press (Northampton, Mass.), Oasis Press (Athens, Ohio), Combo
(Providence, Rhode Island), and Talonbooks (Vancouver, British Columbia).
And we've reupped the series for a second year, and i have been booking
non-ny small presses through july 2005, including firm commitments already
from Conundrum (Chicago), Dissociated Writers Project (Chicago), and Ambit
(Baltimore), and tentative ones from a few killer presses out west that i
can't divulge as yet.

still doing our perfect album shows, with Carole King's Tapestry live on
April 30 at Sidewalk, 20th anniversary of Purple Rain live (followed by the
film) on June 5 or 12 at Bowery Poetry Club, second two elliot smith records
live at boog 13th anniversary party in august, pretenders learning to crawl
in october, and, in december, 25th anniversary of pink floyd's the wall live
(followed by the film).

i think that's it, other than the occasional instant pub i haven't thought
of yet or secret reading in my apartment.

best,
david

I missed A. Highland's post

i was too busy reading all
the book pub..blog links..
mag openings...obits...

i found 0 offensive in it..
except i guess he should
have kept Ron's wife out
if it...she's a civilian...

only in the small spell
that s-m-a-l-l  po woild
do we have to disassociate
a poet from his work..

this creates epistimelogical
problems all its own...

and a mighty fine mess you
got us into Ollie..

it would take a fool
or a critic not to notice
at for ex...the Sillimann/
McClure thang...

the 'look' of the poet..
physical appearance

is she/he hot or not...
is the most determinitive

factor of success in po Woild
& what some call the real
& others the reel world

can i flame meself..
Nudel you're a f....king
moron...besides writing
drivel..and your mama
she's "that's your mother"

too often the unknown
young or awful poet

has no platform to
voice his anger,
discontent, rage..

if you want to play
with the big boys

or be famuz
take the hits..


outside libel...
flame on...sweet..

Dear Aldon and Daniel, I see what you mean and of course I have no
interest whatsoever in thought-policing--the trick always seems to be
to come up with wording that's firm enough, tight enough to prevent
any misunderstanding and in the interests of making myself clear I
might have erred on the side of firm!  But in the defense of over-the-
top firmness, since it is impossible to "manage" the list, impossible
to prevent flames from being sent out, the best I can do is to try to
get people's attention with a little foot-stomping--too many plead
ignorance about our policy on flaming.

I have no problem with faulty logic, arguments with bad
premises/conclusions, snideness or jibes (my personal favorites
anyways) or with, I guess, insulting Vachel Lindsay--I do think that,
as an example, some of the comments made about non-list subscriber
Grolier book's Louisa Solano (insults made about her, her personality,
and therefore her poor business skills) weren't necessary, were unkind
and so unproductive and were of the same variety as so many other
comments about subscribers that I've found upsetting (there are many
more such examples from last Fall alone that you can read over in the
archives). Usually these comments use the list as a forum for airing
personal gripes or for some combination of personal gripe + dismissal
of the person's work (ie Person x was mean/grumpy/arrogant to me and
their work is not worth thinking/talking/writing about).  I don't
think it's too restrictive to ask subscribers to refrain from these
kinds of comments, is it?

Hope this is more clear!
Best, Lori

WORKSHOPS BEGINNING THIS WEEK

BOTH OF THESE WORKSHOPS HAVE BEEN POSTPONED A WEEK, SO YOU HAVEN'T MISSED
ANYTHING:

So You Say You Can't Write Poetry? with Marj Hahne
Four Wednesdays, March 10, 17, 24, 31, 7 - 9 p.m.; $100, $85
for members

As children we were natural poets, but by adulthood, we likely suppressed
some of the sensibilities that enliven our reading and writing of poetry:
(1) a fascination with wordplay and the infinite possibilities of language,
(2) an alert sensory perception, (3) recognition and acceptance of our
unique voice, and (4) patience with our learning process.

Designed for the beginning or tentative poet (although practiced poets will
find it enriching, too!), this educational and fun workshop will present
accessible poetic forms, sample poems, and prompts as structures that allow
for the possibility of poetry as we uncover or recover our individual poetic
voices. We will create a safe space for generating lots of original writing
while attending to the particulars of craft: language choices, the poem's
shape, and various poetic devices.

Marj Hahne is a poet and teaching artist from New York City. Her work has
appeared in Painted Bride Quarterly, Mad Poets Reviews, La Petite Zine,
Rogue Scholars, & New England Writer's Network. She also has a CD entitled,
notspeak.

with Kathryn Radeff

4 Saturdays, March 13, 20, 27, and April 3 10-12 a.m. $135, $110 for
members. Single
class $35, $30 members

The magazine field is overflowing with opportunity. With the right approach
you can craft articles, sell and re-sell to worldwide publications. Open to
everyone, this four-week special workshop focuses on the fundamentals
editors are looking for and presents the secret to writing great marketing
letters. Through in-class and at-home exercises, Kathryn Radeff provides a
fun, effective, and motivational workshop designed to inspire the writer and
develop creative confidence. The workshop also includes creative
self-promotion methods and the business end of publishing. It is recommended
that you purchase the four guidebooks from the "You Can Be A Working Writer"
series at $5.95 each.

I hope we can continue to insult Bush.  He is a public figure and therefore
legally it is not slander to criticize him.

I actually thought the Grolier owner stuff was on-point and relevant.  I
didn't post in that thread, but I have run into that woman myself and she is
definitely unpleasant.  As the store is a major resource for poetry books,
both for us to buy and eventually for us to sell books, discussion of the
store is completely reasonable on a poets' list.

My own experience was that she took one look at me and said "What are you
doing in my store?  You know, we only have *poetry*!" as if I didn't look
the part of a poetry reader (maybe I'm too fat, or too female or something,
or dresse dtoo conservatively...).  Then when I bought Anne Tardos's _Uxudo_
which had just come out, she was all of a sudden friendly because I haad
proven myself worthy by choosing an avant-garde experimental poet, one whom
she knew personally,   I found myself (when I used to be in an MFA program
in Boston) going to the Coop or to the Harvard stor or Wordsworth's (which
never had what I wanted) just because the staff were more friendly.  Which
is saying a lot, since the Coop is not exactly a friendly store!  Also, I'd
go to Cambridge in the ;ate evening after my evening class in Boston, and of
course Grolier's is closed then.  It keeps restricted, dainty (if that makes
sense) hours, not violating any long-since-repealed blue laws.

MIME-Version: 1.0

Congratulations to Clayton Eshleman on this!

http://www.newyorker.com/critics/briefly/?040315crbn_brieflynoted

from The New Yorker's "Briefly Noted" section, March 15, 2004

"Juniper Fuse: Upper Paleolithic Imagination and the Construction of the
Underworld, by Clayton Eshleman (Wesleyan; $29.95). This arresting diptych
of verse and philosophical prose charts a twenty-five-year obsession with
the prehistoric cave paintings of southwestern France. The region's
enigmatic art work, dating from the Upper Paleolithic era, has been a
constant muse for Eshleman, whose wildly discursive style mirrors the
superimposed scenes of animal herds and shamanistic figures that populate
the cave walls. Breathless accounts of cave exploration appear in
counterpoint with poems in eerily primordial voices. Although his thesis
that all art results from the separation anxiety between human and animal is
unpersuasive, there is an impressive exuberance to his efforts to trace back
to this common source everything from Greek myth to Allen Ginsberg. For
Eshleman, it seems, the artist's imaginative predicament is something of a
cave itself, both maze and refuge."


Best Wishes,

this is a bit unfair; the store doesn't make enough $$ to pay for an
extra employee to keep it open after hours.  it's nothing to do with
"daintiness" or blue-law compliance. in fact, those comments sound a
little...dare i use the word sexist?

As lot of us have stories about Louisa Solano of Grolier's sometime
rudeness, but let's remember that she took over the store as a very young
woman and has given her life to poetry in a way that very few of us have.
Her business hours are dictated by her working conditions--she's been the
whole show most of the time, and it's an exhausting job..

On my recent trip to Boston I went into Grolier's shortly before closing
time. It was my first time there in probably 15 years. Louisa and I chatted
briefly, and I mentioned that I had sold the store some copies of a
magazine I did in the early seventies. She asked my name, and then said
"Oh, Broadway Boogie! Black and white covers." That's worth something.

Grolier's, in any case, may not be with us much longer. Its disappearance
would be a major loss.

Anastasios, a colicky baby comes before Haiti, in my book.

Ok, and thanks for your very civil message.  I may very well have a simplistic
image of Haiti.  Most of my data on Haiti comes via Marxists -- it's very hard to
get other info, as nobody else seems to care.  The Lutherans have a few missions
there but you don't get country-wide reports on Haiti via our periodicals as you do
for instance about Namibia (50% Lutheran, and growing).

So I am glad to have you complicate the picture.  I trust your data, because I
don't think you have blinders on, and you even seem to have a sense of humor in
spite of your problems with the baby.

I wouldn't.

I'm especially interested that there are fairly wealthy families in Haiti that
aren't completely corrupt.  From the rather Marxist literature I have read (I've
also read books by former CIA spooks, and then older writing by US military staff
stationed there in the earlier part of the century) you get the picture of a rather
corrupt and almost monstrous elite, and then the poor suffering masses.

All the stuff you're saying about Bush & co. does also make sense, I think.  But I
don't think the Republicans are as monstrous as others seem to think.  Giuliani is
Republican, but believes that gays should be able to get married, and have rights,
and I think he's a decent man in many ways.  No saint, but decent.

And I understand that the crime rate going down in NYC is attributable to his
draconian policies on even minor crimes.

Perhaps there is a larger base of people to work with in Haiti than I had imagined,
so your message actually gave me hope.

Good luck with the baby -- the only thing that seems to quiet my babies down when
they get too crazy is to show them to themselves in the mirror.  They immediately
become quiet, but maybe yours is beyond that stage.  We haven't had a colicky baby
so far.

Thank you for updating me.

I would like to know, if you have a minute, what percentage of the Haitian upper
class might want to see the return of Aristide, and whether this is not mostly a
right-wing coup orchestrated by former members of the long-entrenched Duvalier
regime.

Is Rene Depestre still alive?  Has he written about it in Le Monde or elsewhere?  I
think that Aime Cesaire is still alive -- he was just a few years ago even though
he's at least a nonagenarian if not pressing 100.  Codrescu intrviewed him in
Martinique just two or three years ago.  Perhaps Cesaire will write his version
somewhere.  I want to find some good information.  It's always hard to understand
who's who in that world.

But yes, I basically think that Bush and his team are basically good people, as I
thought that Gore and his team were decent people.  Limited, but not Hitlerian.
Bush's wife is a very lovely librarian.  I don't think she'd marry Hitler.

I think the flaming is met with sufficient responses that generally it evens
out.  This reminds me of the great flame-out caused by Mark Spitzer when he
attacked Ed Dorn and wrote all kinds of personal things about him in Exquisite
Corpse a decade or so ago.  Some thought he shouldn't have said those things.
For me it revived Dorn.  I liked Highland's message -- it was the only thing he's
written that has enabled me to completely understand him, and now it seems that
he isn't able to write any more.  If you can't find anything nice to say don't
say anything was the old rule in Lutheran Sunday School.  Slowly, this board is
getting more and more Lutheran.  I guess I should enjoy that.

I didn't know anything about the wonderful wise and charming woman at Grolier's,
but reading about the skewed and erroneous impressions of her has made me want to
patronize, I mean, buy something at her store.

begrudging) Gabe Gudding. He is, by his own admission,
a barbarian, having beaten up several men in his youth
at parties, and he owns a Hamilton Beach Cappucino
Maker with Pod Holder. And an espresso (or expresso as
his sister says) maker -- yes, he owns such things.
Other expensive appliances? Again, yes: a 4.8 volt
Black&Decker DustBuster. If you saw how he lives, you
would think: ivory tower! Yes, I hate him. He makes
fun of those who say fifty cent.

Hi Kristy,

Thanks, to be honest I'm not sure what to make of 'em yet. As far as
strategies, well… just drinking lots of coffee and writing in a little
notebook. The only real revision happens when I type them up, and even then
it’s pretty minimal. I think I work best with overly ambitious projects, but
so many of them do tend to “fizzle”…At the beginning of the year I’d started
a full-page full-margins piece of prose per day project. Each one took about
four or five hours. I got to ooohh… about January 3rd or so before
jettisoning the project. The ten line thing is much easier, but it does
cause lots of now-I-need-to-write-my-poem-today anxiety. Luckily, there’ll
be no more of that till tomorrow; here’s my little noise o’ the day:

Atlasly 3/8/04

Drama mapped a cricket fiddling genderless noise
Hello hello mimetic heart means copy me
Light falls or fails to sound grass
A bit of soft music from the loud speaker
Dufflebagged in idiot rain the indoor animals
One more valley, one more hill
The intellectual thing was north
Grey sky’s an overused objective
Wants in a green bottle green abundance
O attitude what grows me like this

Wow, well this doesn't sound sexist to me, just maybe wrong. I think
there's a real problem throwing these words around.

I do want to say something about the policy. There are insults and there
are insults. Insulting Bush\whack or Vachel doesn't hurt anyone. Direct
insults on the list against other list members is another thing
altogether. Ad\hominem\femina (?) insults serve no purpose at all but to
lower the level of discourse here. With the imposition of 2 posts/day,
someone doesn't really have the option to reply constantly, and this leads
to a differend; the insult stays unanswered for a while.

The opposite is the real problem, which is a list in which flamewars take
over. This had happened on the old fiction-of-philosophy and Cybermind
lists, both of which I co-moderated, and the result is that at least 1/3
of the subscribers left, and the list became dominated by violent
discourse. If you believe in this space as a commons, you have to deal
with this, or accept the fact that lists will head that direction, and
lose all but the most virulent members.

At this point, wryting, which is the successor to fop, and Cybermind are
both functioning well. After AH was unsubbed (as he noted), he came back;
I used the delete file, and he and I have no problems at all. I won't go
into my side of this. The point is that the lists have both become
continuing and creative communities, and there are numerous others out
there as well, of course - I believe futureculture is one.

Then there is nettime, which _is_ moderated, somewhat behind the scenes,
and it's one of the best discussion lists online, if not the best. It
works with a complex structure, and the level of discourse is incredibly
high. Florian Cramer, Ryan Whyte, and I do the 'unstable digest' which is
sent out, usually once a week, for freer efforts, which are culled from a
number of other lists.

List governance, as Poetics has pointed out, is very tricky, and
difficult. Almost any direction taken results in a lot of onlist and a lot
more offlist email (I received huge numbers of complaints over just about
any flamewar on the lists I co-moderate; these are sent back-channel, but
have to be taken into consideration). There's no clear answer. I do feel
that the running of Poetics has been exemplary.

I do want to add, for example, that the attack on Rothenberg (I haven't
followed all of this), was disenheartening; I have nothing but admiration
for him, and just picked up the original BIG edition of The Big Jewish
Book, which I love, and which has always revitalized my relationship to
Judaica. It locates freedom in stricture, play in paradigm, and is
wonderful - as are all of his anthologies, as far as I'm concerned.

- Alan

Maria, Millie is a woman. I can theoretically understand that a woman may be=
=20
a sexist too (contra her own gender). But does "dainty" connote only Victori=
an=20
embroidery daintiness? What about an anti-gay "mincing" daintiness? I think=20
Millie was referring to aristocratic, art-for-art's-sake, "southern"=20
daintiness.=20

Dainty used to have positive connotations, e.g., an medieval/Elizabethan=20
"dainty meal." I think one can write a history of Western culture around the=
 word=20
dainty, its permutations, riffs of new meanings. Ciao.

I had forgotten this until now:

When I was a teenager, I went along with the Forensic
Society to some poetry-reciting competition.  There
were trophies.

I chose Vachel Linday's "The Congo."  I can still
remember the opening lines:

"Fat, black bucks in a [wine barrel?] room,
Barrel house kings with feet unstable
Sagged and reeled and pounded on a table,
Pounded on the table with the handle of a broom
Crying BOOM-Lay BOOM-Lay BOOM-Lay BOOM.

Then came the Congo [the Niger?] creeping through the
black . . ."

One of the things that I find disappointing with blogs
is that it's like listening to someone in
psychoanalysis go on and on, talking to the ceiling,
except without ever getting to the point of breaking
through the ego defenses and unleashing repressed
material, ---never realizing and getting to the point
of saying that they want to kill their fathers and
unclench their throbbing sphincters.  It's like
reading daily reenforcements of False Self.

I didn't win a trophy that time.  I had listened to
recordings (phonograph albums) of Lindsay reading "The
Congo."  He had a ~very~ unnatural, stilted way of
reading: he would accelerate at points, then slow
down, his voice getting nasal and freaky . . .

And I trained to imitate his rendition ~exactly.~

So, they gave me no trophy (phallus).

I thought it was ironic that they apparently wanted
some more streamlined, normative reading style and
that a facsimile of Lindsay himself wasn't
prize-worthy.

Repeating the lines, I realize now that the poem
must've sounded horribly racist, especially at the
time, when Black Power was very much a thing in the
air.  I wonder if I realized it was about Africans at
all.  Maybe I thought the Congo was something like a

To his credit, Lindsay was an important early film critic --

To his discredit, he seemed absolutely unable to comprehend why so many readers
found THE CONGO racist --

Go back and look at DEAD POET SOCIETY again -- you'll note that the poem the
boys are changint as they emerge from their cave is THE CONGO! white male
bonding of a sort I'm glad to have missed -- (but hey, they probably wouldn't
let me in Skull & Bones either, or Yale for that matter)

Reviews:

"Cochrane dazzles, and that's for sure. His is a big talent.  He has
enormous energy and range.  Pathology, mythology, family rites, the
weirdly homoerotic ambience of the hockey rink, and the sweaty
ironies of the gymnasium are some of the fuels that drive his
poetics.  His writing is muscular, his optic daring and
original....At his best, and he is often there, Mark Cochrane is a
glorious writer."

sometimes shifts to simplicity--the poetic equivalent of a power

I'll bite on the "say something nice about Vachel Lindsay" thread.  My
father recites Vachel Lindsay occasionally.  It is nauseatingly politically
incorrect (the poem I'm thinking of is the one about the Congo) in an
imperialist way, which I don't like, but the popem IS catchy when
well-recited.  It has a pleasing beat to it.  The meter and versification in
general are recognizable Bad but nonetheless one can get a guilty pleasure
from listening to it.

Are Bad poets more entertaining than Good poets? (I use these terms
ironically of course.)

Is, say narrative nineteenth century verse a la Tennyson or (to name a poet
in bad repute) Swinburne more entertaining than Language poetry, for
example?  I mean, whatever you can say against it, Tennyson's Idylls of the
King, it at least has craft and a good story (granted not one original to
Tennyson), whereas it is harder to pin down craft in postmodern or
avant-garde poetry (or even Modernist, for that matter), and no "Poetics
List" style poet would ever admit to writing a poem with a plot line or
"story."  (I actually write narrative poems sometimes and have gotten them
published in decent, if not terrific, places.  But I use stories with a
surreal and generally postmodernly ironic tinge.)

I actually _do_ find Language poetry entertaining as a matter of fact.  I am
reading Silliman's "Lit" (part of The Alphabet).  I read N/O (partially)
some years ago.   I think there is a lot of humor in Silliman's work, as in
Bernstein's and Steve McCaffery's.  (I showed my father the Vachel-reciter a
page of "The Cheat of Words" by McCaffery and he couldn't believe that it
was taken seriously.  I said it isn't serious as in solemn, since there is
humor, but, yes, Language Poets are taken seriously as poets... :-)

Some poetry, on the other hand, is not "fun" but seems more in the "good for
you" category.  I can't really identify anything that fits this description,
though, because so much poetry that I initially found hard to get through
(e.g. Wallace Stevens, and for entirely different reasons, Frank O'Hara) now
seem pretty undeniably good.  (Well, O'Hara wrote some Bad poems I think,
like the one about talking to the sun -- literally -- on Fire Island, but
The Day Lady Died is a classic I think.)

Have I avoided ad hominem attacks?  I do think it is fair to criticize the
dead, unless one is with the grieving family or something!

Millie

P.S.  My father also likes to recite Good poetry, like Eliot's Sweeney Among
the Nightingales or Browning's My Last Duchess (does anyone want to argue
that Browning is actually Bad?).  I think he caught these poems, as one
catches the flu, in school and college at a time when people memorized.  I
can distinguish terrible poems from masterpieces (I hope) by now, but as a
five year old I just liked the sound of poetry, ANY poetry.

Spalding Gray, 62, Actor and Monologuist, Is Confirmed Dead

By Jesse McKinley

NY Times, March 8, 2004

Spalding Gray, the wry monologuist and actor who transformed his personal
experiences, fascinations and traumas into such acclaimed pieces as
"Swimming to Cambodia" and "Monster in a Box,"was confirmed dead today, two
months after his wife reported him missing, a spokeswoman for the city
medical examiner's office said. He was 62.

Mr. Gray's body was pulled from the East River near Greenpoint, Brooklyn, on
Sunday and was identified through dental records, said the spokeswoman,
Ellen Borakove. The authorities did not provide the cause of death.

Mr. Gray, who had been battling depression, was reported missing on Jan. 11,
a day after he had left his apartment in Manhattan and never returned. He
had told his family that he was going to see friends.

Several witnesses told detectives investigating the disappearance that they
had seen Mr. Gray aboard the Staten Island Ferry on the night of Jan. 10,
the police said.

Almost always seated behind a simple desk, with a glass of water and some
notes, Mr. Gray practiced the art of storytelling with a quiet mania,
alternating between conspiratorial whispers and antic screams as he roamed
through topics large and small.

This talent was perhaps never better displayed than in "Swimming to
Cambodia," his 1984 monologue in which his experiences filming a small role
in the movie "The Killing Fields" became a jumping-off point for exploring
the history and culture of war in Southeast Asia. The piece was itself
turned into a noted film, directed by Jonathan Demme, in 1987.

"Swimming" may have been Mr. Gray's most famous work, but for 25 years, he
turned out a consistent stream of well-crafted, well-received pieces on
subjects as varied as writing ("Monster in a Box," 1990) and illness
("Gray's Anatomy," 1993), to less-weighty issues like learning to ski ("It's
a Slippery Slope," 1996) and performing while high on LSD ("Point Judith,"
1980).

His relentless self-absorption drew a broad range of audiences, from those
at such high-end, 1,000-seat theaters as the Vivian Beaumont at Lincoln
Center (where he produced four shows during the 1990's) to downtown crowds
at the 100-seat theaters at the Performing Garage and P.S. 122, two
performance spaces where he typically fine-tuned his monologues.

While his performances resembled - and influenced - the confessional style
of contemporaries like Eric Bogosian and John Leguizamo, Mr. Gray's work
also displayed an instinctive curiosity and taste for first-person research,
turning his life travels and travails into a type of closely observed,- and
publicly performed, autobiography.

A self-confessed depressive, he reportedly attempted suicide at least once
before in recent years, Mr..Gray had a common refrain in many of his
monologues: a search for larger meaning, a quest, as he put it, for "the
perfect moment."

The monologues were also, for the record, usually painfully funny.

"He is a sit-down monologuist with the comic sensibility of a stand-up
comedian," Mel Gussow wrote in The New York in 1981 in a review of "47
Beds," a chronicle of all the beds, and continents, Mr. Gray had slept in.
"He describes in vivid detail his search for self-discovery, and then laughs
at himself and needles nirvana."

One of three sons, Mr. Gray was born on June 5, 1941, in Barrington, R.I.
His father was a factory worker, and his mother a homemaker; Mr. Gray
referred to himself as "a Rhode Island WASP," raised in a house he depicted
as rife with repression, depression and all kinds of neurosis. Perhaps as a
reaction to that, Mr. Gray, tall and lanky with an awkward charm, began
acting in high school; by his mid-20's that interest had blossomed into a
modest career as an actor on the regional theater circuit.

In 1967 Mr. Gray moved to New York and soon emerged as an active member of
the city's then-thriving downtown experimental theater scene. In 1970 he
joined director Richard Schechner's influential troupe, the Performance
Group, and in 1973, appeared in the New York premiere of "Tooth of Crime,"
by Sam Shepard.

In the mid-1970's, Mr. Gray left Mr. Schechner's troupe to help found the
Wooster Group, an experimental company based at the Performing Garage, a
converted flatware factory on Wooster Street in SoHo. His connections to the
group ran deep; Mr. Gray had dated another of the company's founders,
Elizabeth LaCompte, and was a friend of the actor Willem Dafoe, also a
company founder who later became Ms. LaCompte's long-term boyfriend. Until
his death, Mr. Gray kept an apartment in the same building on Wooster Street
as Mr. Dafoe and Ms. LaCompte, as well as a home on Long Island, in North
Haven.

From the company's founding, Mr. Gray and Ms. LaCompte were the principal
writers, turning out a series of plays based on his memories of childhood in
Rhode Island. His mother, Elizabeth Gray, also suffered from depression, and
committed suicide in 1967. That event triggered a long depression for Mr.
Gray, but also inspired "Rumstick Road," a 1977 production of the Wooster
Group, created and directed by Mr. Gray and Ms. LaCompte.

By 1979, Mr. Gray had decided to pursue the monologue as a type of
performance art, and soon hit on his basic set (desk, water, notes) and
approach (simple, measured, candid). His first piece, "Sex and Death to the
Age of 14," told the story of just that, setting an autobiographical tone
that would continue throughout his career, including such self-explanatory
titles as "Booze, Cars, and College Girls," and "India (and After)," the
story of a Wooster Group tour to India.

In recent years his monologues became ever more personal, however, examining
his adventures in fatherhood ("Morning, Noon, and Night," in 1999), and his
final piece, " Life Interrupted," which dealt with a serious car accident he
and his wife and manager Kathleen Russo suffered in Ireland in 2001. He
performed parts of the work late last year at P.S. 122 in the East Village,
and many who saw it considered it his darkest work yet.

In addition to film versions of several of his monologues, Mr. Gray appeared
in nearly 40 movies, including "True Stories" (1986), "Beaches" (1988), "The
Paper" (1994) and "Beyond Rangoon" (1995); he also appeared on Broadway in
1988 as the Stage Manager in "Our Town," and in 2000 as a political
candidate in "Gore Vidal's The Best Man."

In addition to Ms. Russo, Mr. Gray is survived by two brothers, Rockwell
Gray, a professor of English at Washington University in St. Louis; Channing
Gray, a music critic for The Providence Journal; his former wife, Renee
Shafransky; two sons, Theo and Forrest; and a stepdaughter, Marissa.

In his 1980 show "Point Judith," Mr. Gray spoke a line that may well have
summed up his life and career. "It's very hard for me," he said. "Not to
tell everybody everything."

I continue - with great pleasure - to investigate and play with this Visual
Thesaurus! It might be either fashionable, true or both, these days, to
imagine "parallel universes." But, partly, as I watch the visual thesaurus
site spin out the cosmology of its (word) wares, I began to ask whether or
not a Thesaurus, on some level and by definition, posits the possibility of
multiple, parallel universes. That is for every poem there is either a
correspondent poem (o dear, back to Spicer & Lorca again), or a poem that i=
s
correspondent, but oppositional, absolutely contrary in its terms. Could a
thesaurus take the universe Ron S's "Ketjak" and either create a parallel
version,or, so to speak, turn the weave upside down, and reveal its
antithesis through its linguistic opposites. Or maybe it's possible to read
any work with its reversal of terms as part of the critical experience of
reading it. It's not necessarily an anti-Authoritarian gesture, by maybe a
way of enlarging the work, and taking that end of the creative
responsibility as the reader of the work.

It's pronounced "fitty," Joseph. "Fitty cent" is how we barbarians say

Also I do not own no cappucino maker. That is owned by the person who

Thanks for the new poem Noah, I feel the noise. (Especially the last 2 lines.)
And thanks for letting me in on your approach. I'm halfway there with the lots
of coffee and a tiny, glitter-covered notebook I bought at Just-A-Buck three
months ago and thus far has simply added mass to the piles of #!@& on my
office floor...

Yeah, I once tried the Harry Matthews 20-lines-a-day thing--I was so
inspired--for 8 days. I still wish I could get back to that one, because the
freedom to write in either "verse" OR "prose"--in other words, whatever--was
useful to my writing process in general--and that latitude should've made it
easier, dammit. And "line" can be defined in so many ways, can't it? A word, a
letter, a breath--I even did the writing on a grassy rump overlooking Lake
Michigan during a rare and gorgeous Chicago June--yet, no go.

But, I'll keep at it--let me know how the 100 days go. And please pass on a
few more 10-packs.

I continue - with great pleasure - to investigate and play with this Visual
Thesaurus! It might be either fashionable, true or both, these days, to
imagine "parallel universes." But, partly, as I watch the visual thesaurus
site spin out the cosmology of its (word) wares, I began to ask whether or
not a Thesaurus, on some level and by definition, posits the possibility of
multiple, parallel universes. That is for every poem there is either a
correspondent poem (o dear, back to Spicer & Lorca again), or a poem that is
correspondent, but oppositional, absolutely contrary in its terms. Could a
thesaurus take the universe Ron S's "Ketjak" and either create a parallel
version,or, so to speak, turn the weave upside down, and reveal its
antithesis through its linguistic opposites. Or maybe it's possible to read
any work with its reversal of terms as part of the critical experience of
reading it. It's not necessarily an anti-Authoritarian gesture, by maybe a
way of enlarging the work, and taking that end of the creative
responsibility as the reader of the work.

Haiti as Target Practice

How the US Press Missed the Story

By HEATHER WILLIAMS


"The fact that the group in charge of Haiti policy today in

the State Department has been literally gunning for

Aristide since before his initial election as a champion of democracy in

1990 has been left all but unmentioned by the US press."


Now that bodies are littering the streets of Cap Haitien

and Port Au Prince, major print news outlets have seen well enough to

send a handful of cameramen and correpondents to send back news of the

crisis. Even so, the campaign of violence that has finally ousted

Haitian President Aristide has been investigated and reported to the

American public with appalling indolence. The official reasoning appears

to be that if Haiti is the hemisphere's eternal basket case-a dismal

repository of poverty where there is no future-- how on earth could its

past possibly matter?


But those who view Haiti's current violence as merely one

of an eternal humanitarian crisis in temporary overdrive

miss the story. It is no simple tale of a corrupt regime collapsing

under the weight of popular anger and bad management. A cursory glance

at events of the last fourteen years suggests that the fall of the

Aristide regime was a foregone conclusion at the entrance of President

George W. Bush and the installation of a cabal of appointees with a grim

record of utilizing official and covert channels to destabilize

uncooperative governments in the Western Hemisphere. What is immediately

ominous about the current crisis in Haiti is the likely prospect that

leaders of armed groups making a final assault on the capital will play

important roles in a post-Aristide order. Such armed groups include the

Tontons Macoutes, the gunmen who viciously supervised repression under

both father and son Duvaliers' dictatorships until 1986. They also

include members of the disbanded Haitian army that held power for three

years following the coup against President Aristide in 1991, and the

FRAPH death squads that mowed down the ranks of democratic civil society

during that period, leaving over 3,000 dead and thousands more in exile.

What is also now worrisome about this crisis is what it likely indicates

about the intentions of the U.S. State Department and security apparatus

elsewhere in the Caribbean.


Now that Aristide's government, protected by a flimsy

police force and a smattering of civilian gangs, has

collapsed, quiet references in news stories and opinion

pieces suggest that editors are wishing that perhaps they

had a few more questions along the way about what indeed

was going on in Haiti. Notably, until mid-February of this

year The New York Times instructed its readers, for weeks

on end, with no evidence whatsoever, that the armed groups referred to

generically and occasionally quite sympathetically as "rebels" represent

a home-grown anti-Aristide opposition. For weeks the New York Tinmes

used AP and Reuters dispatches to present the Haitian crisis as one

simply of domestic protest and unrest.


It wasn't until February 15 that the NYT's own reporter,

Lydia Polgreen bothered to mention that the group marching

on Gonaïves known a the Cannibal Army was led by "sinister figures from

[Haiti's] past," including the infamous Louis-Jodel Chamblain, a soldier

who led death squads in the 1980s through the mid-1990s and was

convicted in absentia for his involvement in the murder of Antoine

Izméry, a well-known pro-democracy activist. Also unexplored by the same

reporters were reports that the groups terrorizing Gonaïves had come

from across the border, from the Dominican Republic. Given this

knowledge, it is curious that no reporter then bothered to inquire how

these groups obtained ample caches of brand-new M-16s, M-60s, armor

piercing weapons, all-terrain vehicles, and rocket-propelled grenade

launchers-equipment far beyond the reach of the Haiti's own impecunious

security forces.


Was the story too dangerous to investigate? Was the

situation indecipherable? Was the prospect of a weak regime giving way

to another in the hemisphere's poorest country just not a story worth

the time and effort? The tragedy of this episode is that much of it was

abundantly transparent. Running a sixty-second web search on any of the

principals involved leads one to a fetid two-decade history of CIA and

U.S. ultra-right subterfuge in Haiti. The fact that the group in charge

of Haiti policy today in the State Department has been literally gunning

for Aristide since before his initial election as a champion of

democracy in 1990 has been left all but unmentioned by the press. Also

forgotten is the fact that members of the armed groups burning their way

through Haiti's cities today include groups that, (according to myriad

sources including sworn testimony before Congress by U.S. officials,

reporters, and reports of Haitian recipients of covert aid,) were

funneling drugs to the U.S. while in the pay of U.S. intelligence

agents.


The point is not that the public has been lied to by the government.

Governments lie, particularly this administration. The point is that

even those on the left who are indignant about systematic misinformation

elsewhere have not bothered to jog their memories on Haiti to smell the

sulfur emanating from this episode,. The press apparatus reporting on

the Caribbean is either too broken or too racist to remember that

Haiti's anguish is connected to forces quite beyond poor judgment or

even bad will by President Aristide. The ease with which armed thugs

have upended a civilian regime, eliciting only murmurs of disquiet from

onlookers abroad who ought to know better is cause for worry. Surely

zealots in charge of U.S. foreign policy have taken note. If it's this

easy to destabilize Haiti , Cuba will unquestionably appear a more

viable target for direct intervention in the not-so-distant future.


At least four lines of inquiry were left nearly untouched

in the last four weeks of reporting of Haiti.


First, no one bothered to ask who the rebels were and why

they were advancing on major cities. If in fact they represented a broad

opposition, as reporters readily implied or stated openly, why were the

rebels unable to furnish the barest credible details of their demands,

their civilian bases of support, and their connections to leaders of

civil society groups? Despite literally weeks of lead time, no Haitians

in positions of authority, no public figures, and no Haitian

intellectuals living here or on the island emerged in press stories as

sources of reliable information. Haitians who were quoted in news

stories tended to be taxi drivers presumably shuttling skittish

reporters from hotel to dinner, or randomly-chosen opponents of Aristide

on the street. Predictably, such individuals expressed generic

discontent with the government. Thus, even though a number of more

respectable political opponents of President Aristide were claiming that

armed groups outside the capital were not acting on their behalf, the

story by default became a spurious tale of an embattled people

challenging a repressive and incompetent government. Stories closer to

the truth supported by evidence were likely never taken up because such

messiness would necessitate a greater number of column inches than

editors were going to allot to Haiti.


The second instance of media negligence was the

near-universal acceptance of the idea in the

English-language press that Aristide's government had lost

all popular legitimacy due to reported irregularities in

the 2000 parliamentary elections. This is an extraordinary

leap given the monkey business plaguing U.S. elections of

the same year. According to Tom Reeves, the admittedly poorly-attended

elections were not the stuff of grand vote larceny. "All sides," he

wrote in a very fine article last fall in Dollars and Sense, "concede

that Aristide won the presidential ballot with 92 percent of the voteThe

sole disagreement is over run-off elections for seven senators from

Aristide's part who obtained pluralities but not majorities in the first

round. The seven senators eventually resigned, making way for new

elections."


Nonetheless, these electoral "abuses" were grounds for the

Bush administration and pliant international partners in

Europe to suspend hundreds of millions of dollars in credit lines and

aid to Haiti. Allegations of fraud were used to permanently block the

release of $400 million in already-approved loans from the Interamerican

Development Bank. The IMF, World Bank, and European Union were also

pressed to cut off crucial lines of credit. Meanwhile, Haiti was

brutally taken to task for its external financial obligations, emptying

its coffers in July 2003 to pay $32 million in debt service arrears. As

a final blow, Haiti's ability to conserve any remaining foreign reserves

was foreclosed by agreements signed with the U.S. government under

President Clinton in 1996. These obliged Haiti to abolish tariffs on

U.S. imports in the name of what was curiously called "free trade" but

was in fact commodity dumping by U.S. exporters. Under threat of huge

fines, Haiti was obliged to accept the import of foodstuffs priced far

below the cost of production. (Direct subsidies to U.S. farmers since

the mid-1990s have averaged over $30 billion a year.) In a nation where

the majority of the population works in agriculture, this all but shut

down production in the rice-producing northwest of Haiti, as well as

among livestock producers throughout the country. Under these

conditions, it stands to reason that no government could dodge the

discontent of the population.


The third line of neglected inquiry was the question of who

the injured "opposition" was in Haiti, on whose behalf this official

bloodletting took place. According to Stan Goff, whose thorough article

appeared in on this Counterpunch site on February 9 of this year, the

fifteen-party anti-Aristide coalition known as "Convergence" includes

"every faction of the Haitian dominant class, factions who are generally

at war with one another." Despite anemic support from the voting public

(never approaching even 20 percent in opinion polls conducted even by

the U.S.) what apparently they were able to converge on was three

million dollars a year in funding in from the International Republican

Institute, a Republican-party backed arm of the National Endowment for

Democracy.


Finally, no one has asked questions about the wildly

partisan officials in U.S. State Department now running

U.S. policy in the Caribbean and Latin America. These

include such Blast-from-the-Past supporters of Reagan era highjinks in

Central America as Otto Reich, John Negroponte, Elliot Abrams, and

(before his ignominious departure last summer) John Poindexter. The most

visible in recent weeks on Haiti has been Assistant Secretary of State

for Western Hemisphere Affairs Roger Noriega, a man who has had Aristide

in his gunsights for over a decade. As senior staff member for the

Committee on Foreign Relations of the U.S. Senate, and advisor to

Senator Jesse Helms and John Burton, he was party to a three-year

campaign to prevent to defame Aristide and prevent his return to power;

all the while CIA-backed thugs left carnage in the streets daily in Port

Au Prince. In his capacity in the State Department since 2003, and for

two years before that as the U.S. Permanent Representative to the OAS,

he has aggressively advertised his intention to oust Aristide a second

time.


For example, in April of last year, speaking at the Council

of the Americas conference in Washington, he linked U.S. policies in

Haiti to those in Venezuela and Cuba. He congratulated the OAS for

overcoming "irrelevance in the past years" by adopting the

Inter-American Democratic Charter. Article 20, he said, lays out a

series of actions to be takenin the event that a member state should

fail to uphold the essential elements of democratic life. He added the

"President Chavez and President Aristide have contributed willfully to a

polarized and confrontational environment. It is my fervent hope," he

added ominously, "that the good people of Cuba are studying the

Democratic Charter."


Given the inability of Haitians at present to question the direction of

whatever succession takes place in the coming weeks, the question of how

fully Noriega and his fanatical friends will control U.S. foreign policy

in the Americas is crucial. Secretary of State Colin Powell has been

cravenly circumspect in his statements on Haiti, straddling the line

between encouraging Aristide to step down and discouraging those who

would involve the U.S. extensively in any transition effort or

state-building mission. What Powell's late entrance into the situation

suggests strongly is that Latin America and the Caribbean are considered

so insignificant that Noriega and his half-cocked cronies are generally

left to play with matches until the fire alarm goes off. In this case,

Florida voters were that alarm. Undoubtedly higher-ups in the White

House were a bit uneasy at the prospect of thousands of Haitians fleeing

chaos being thrown back into the sea by the US Coast Guard in an

election year. But the modus operandi of Noriega and company is

unmistakeable: fund an opposition, report every clash as repression

against the population, arm pliable thugs and mercenaries in exile,

embargo the government, precipitate acute crisis, play up the discontent

of a hungry population, and then happily leave it to internationalist

liberals to lead the charge for military intervention on humanitarian

grounds. So with President Aristide neutralized now, it's time to look

elsewhere, maybe west across the sea to Cuba.

Man, the whole Carib is that way. It doesn't matter if the Reps or Dems are in
office. I worked for Amb. Dessima Williams, who was a member of the New Jewel
Movement in Grenada in the 1980s. She worked for Maurice Bishop as Grenadine
Amb to the US, UN, OAS, IMF, and World Bank. She was able to get declassified
all State Dept. communiques dealing with Grenada during the Carter
administration. One of my responsibilities was to compare what Cyrus Vance was
saying in the papers vis-a-vis the actual US gov't actions behind the scenes.
And, we were going into Grenada with or without the Coard coup. Grenada had set
up an alternative governmental model and it was trading with Nicaragua and
Cuba. Um...that's a no no in the eyes of the "good people/leaders" of
Washington DC. The coup opened the door and gave Reagan an absolute green
light.

Same goes for Aristide. It's same old shite different day and nation in the
Caribbean Basin.

Kirby, no I don't have hard empirical data to share with you re: how many
wealthy people in Haiti backed Aristide.

Yesterday evening - in talking with an IT person who happened to be Belgian
- he let me know two additional things I did not know about the VT:

1. It operates like other search engines (Google, etc.) and picks up the
associative words across the web in a similar manner. (We did not have time
to explore that further). In other words, no one or group "wrote" this
Thesaurus.

2. That the Visual Thesaurus can be used for any other language, as well.
He uses it when he is writing it in French.  I tried it this morning with a
couple of French words and nothing came up for "larme" or "chemin". "Poulet"
came up bi-lingual, "chicken" and "volaille."
Does anyone know who to get the Visual Thesaurus to go "French" or any other
language?

Some words in English do not come up with anything. Ironically nothing for
"other".

Here's three Zukofsky poems in Basque, courtesy Harry Gilonis in London.
The first should, as Harry says, be easy enough to guess.
======
1. ANEW #21.

Eguzki izpi batek zapuzten ote du bere helburua
Pentsatzean sakon edo ilun agertuz gero?

Ikus eguzki, eta pentsa itzal.

+++++
2. ANEW #33.

Gidatu, musuak arin,
ikusi beharrik ez
eskuak edo betileak
ahoa neskaren belarrian
zuhaitzak edo hostoak
gau edo egunak.

+++++

Here's three Zukofsky poems in Basque, courtesy Harry Gilonis in London.
The first should, as Harry says, be easy enough to guess.
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D
1. ANEW #21.

Eguzki izpi batek zapuzten ote du bere helburua
Pentsatzean sakon edo ilun agertuz gero?

Ikus eguzki, eta pentsa itzal.

+++++
2. ANEW #33.

Gidatu, musuak arin,
ikusi beharrik ez
eskuak edo betileak
ahoa neskaren belarrian
zuhaitzak edo hostoak
gau edo egunak.

+++++
3. THE CHALLENGE POEM.

Aldon, Anastasios and others interested in the politics of Haiti --

What Heather Williams is saying is pretty much what I thought was going on in
Haiti.  I saw a film about twenty years ago on US Business interests in Haiti.  The
film was done by a communist outfit but was intelligent and well-documented.  It
argued several things simultaneously (I think the film was called Haiti: Powder Keg
of the Caribbean).

1.  Lower-level American jobs are leaving to go to what I believe they called
"warehouse states" such as Haiti and the Philippines, where you can get people who
are starving to work for subsistence wages.  This is bad for American workers
because all those jobs are lost, and they never come back.

2.  It is also bad for the workers in the countries that multinational corporations
are occupying, such as Haiti, because the multinational corporations are so
powerful that the locals couldn't possibly stand up to them in any meaningful way,
and the local countries' dictators HAVE to take what pitiful US bribes are offered,
in order to man their own militia to prevent popular uprisings among their
impoverished workers.

(This is where I suspect Aristide was not playing ball -- refusing to take the
bribes, and in his own way trying to get the deal to work better for the average
Haitian -- he was afterall a man of God -- and this has to have been his agenda.)

3.  Where I didn't buy the film, and where I thought it went way offtrack, was in
arguing that Haiti should go communist.  You know, a central party, with a
"secretary" in whom all power is vested, but an enlightened despot, along the lines
of Plato's philosopher-king.  I'm so tired of that idea -- it has never worked --
the only person who can get such a spot has to be a ruthless bastard willing to
kill all opposition such as Stalin, Pol Pot, Hoxha, Mao, you name it.  The Marxist
system simply doesn't work, and never will, at least not as it has been classically
put into operation throughout the last pitiful century.

WHAT DOES?

That is my question.  But I want to preface it with a little political history.
Most of our thinking in the left now comes out of a watershed or two.  One is
Marx.  There are many on this listserv who still think Marx had some good ideas.
What were they?  Why is it that they have never played out n any positive
algorhythm? Is there something that that man thought that is still useful?

Our most recent watershed is the Tel Quel Maoists of 68 -- Kristeva, Barthes,
Foucault, Derrida, Sollers, and so on.  They lookd to Mao.  Kristeva wrote a
terrible book about Mao's genius -- Chinese Women.  It's a disturbing book because
it's so completely stupid.  Nobody reads it any longer, but she actually thought
Maoism was going to lead to utopia.  She has recently written a book saying that
Charles de Gaulle was the best political mind of her era.  She's flip-flopped
completely, in other words.

Foucault gave AIDS to other men after he knew he had it himself.  He also suggests
that molesting children is a good idea (pp. 33-34) in History of Sexuality, part
one.  I don't see anything useful in his work.  I see a lot that will lead to a
total breakdown of community in favor of selfish pleasure.  I think children should
be first in a society, and that adults' job is to grow up and serve them.

Barthes was mown down by a laundry truck but in his later work was moving out of
political models into aesthetics.

Derrida is moving into discussions of Judaism which I haven't read.  Having read
his early work, I don't think any of it would interest me.

In Slovenia, one of our more recent leftist geniuses, Slavoj Zizek, is writing
books such as The Fragile Absolute: Why the Christian Legacy is Worth Fighting For
-- he has only a tangential understanding of Christianity, but these books are
interesting because they move in unpredictable ways toward an acceptance of the
Christian ethos..

They are parallel in fact to my work in this area of trying to build a Christian
(specifically Lutheran) surrealism.

As I go through this list, I wonder about the politics of the different
combatants.  Part of the lapse of theory is that nobody stresses these questions
any longer.  Maybe nobody knows any thing about philosophy any more, or never did.

Are there any SPECIFIC ideas in Trotsky, Mao, etc., that anybody would still stand
by?

I read all these people in graduate school, and was floored by how authoritarian it
was.  In 1975 or so, when LANGUAGE started, they were citing Marx and others a
lot.  Silliman's theory seemed to be based in a control of the distribution of
poetry or something (I never really understood it).  Now in Silliman's blog, for
instance, he almost  never cites any political philosophers.  He seems to be
primarily interested in aesthetics.

I occasionally get back channel blasts from elderly leftists who hold up Finland
and Scandinavia in order to hoist me with my own petard.  It's true I love Finland,
but for heaven's sake, it is a democracy, and it is moving to the right.  They're
scrapping the welfare state before everybody turns into a state-sponsored drunk.
It is still much cushier than America for the poor, and probably nobody there can
even conceive of what it's like to be really poor in America, much less Haiti.

I think the basic thread of the Scandinavian democracies is based on a Lutheranism
that goes back deep into the centuries.  It takes centuries to build a common base
of ideas.  Today those ideas are being unravelled or forgotten in Finland by many
in Helsinki, but the ethos remains very very strong in the rural areas.

It seems to me that the generation before mine in America really only believed in
sex.  The only church was sex.  The only source of ultimate meaning.  Family,
children, communities, went to pieces.

Part of my project is to recuperate Lutheranism, but also Locke, and other
Christian-based philosophies.  Those people had good ideas.  I'll cite one:

Locke's idea that there are four things a government should protect:

Life, liberty, health, and possessions, would be a useful thing to think about in
terms of who gets to run Haiti.

I don't know any other better list.  It appears to me that the "rebels" are not
respecting ANY of these four basic and what Locke calls "God-given" rights.

Locke made this country function.  Marxism doesn't function.  Locke can unlock the
mystery of the universal misery index, and explain why Haiti is on the bottom.

Marxism is just a muddle of confusion. Anastasios says there are decent aristocrats
in Haiti.  According to Marxism, that shouldn't be the case.  These decent people
must be actual Christians, along the lines of Aristide himself.

Is there some clear and specific update to that Manichean system of the good worker
and the bad owner in Marxism that I have missed?  Or are there new leftist ideas or
philosophers that I should read?

Luther's ideas of two kingdoms are still workable, and they are why I object to
most Christian orders who want the kingdom to be here on earth right now.  That nut
Koresh with his hideous notions stemming from Seventh-Day Adventism, for instance.
He apparently thought that he himself was the Second Coming.  How easily thought
leads to disaster, and how hard it is to come up with a workable and functioning
political philosophy.  I think the precious legacy of the west is worth fighting
for.

No flaming, now.

I hope others will do as Kirby has done and lay out their world leader
pretend agenda.  This is not a flame, since Michael Stipe used the line in
a song on REM's Green.

And I would argue simply that any society that works has a commons.  By
that I mean more than common values and common goals (which actually it
cannot have all the way down), but common property.  Otherwise, it is
everyone for themselves and god against us all.

I think this position is compatible with Rawlsian liberalism.  I also
continue to stand by the Trotskyite notion of permanent revolution, though
I think he borrowed this from Luxembourg and the Russian Formalists.

yours in the struggle,
Robert

John Thompson is the best known performer of early music for the guqin ("goo
chin"), a Chinese silk string zither that was the instrument most favored by
 Chinese philosophers and aesthetes. He has focused on early repertoire,
personally reconstructing over 120 melodies published in 15th and 16th
century handbooks. In 1992, he was invited by the National Union of Chinese
Musicians as the focus of a seminar on reconstructing music from the
earliest surviving qin handbook, Shen Qi Mi Pu. While based in Hong Kong as
artistic consultant to the Festival of Asian Arts he performed throughout
East Asia, and published seven CDs of his musical reconstructions as well as
four books of music transcription.

Kirby--The Heather Williams piece does suggest that you were on the right
track with your good question about who the heck these unnamed "rebels"
are, but in other ways your comments seem to cut against the grain of her
analysis.  Your repeated characterization of the country as a kind of
irredeemable shithole of "bad history" seems to be just the attitude she's
lamenting, in so far as it encourages one to just throw one's hands up in
despair.  That's not entirely fair to you, though, since you *are* still
asking
what's to be done.  But Williams's analysis of what we have *already* done
suggests possibilities you're ignoring.  Let me just quote her last
paragraph
as a recap:

But the modus operandi of Noriega and company is
>

>

>

It seems that if we would just *refrain* from doing this sort of
stuff, it would be a step in the right direction...

Charlemagne Palestine
SACRED BORDELLO
March 19-20, 2004

Friday, March 19, 7pm PERFORMANCE
Saturday, March 20, 2-5pm BOOK SIGNING

Marianne Boesky Gallery is pleased to present a weekend celebration of the
seminal visual/performance/sound artist Charlemagne Palestine and the
premiere launch of „Sacred Bordello‰ (2004, Black Dog Press), a
comprehensive monograph including essays, scores, and original photos of
both his performances and installations. This represents the first major
publication on Charlemagne Palestine‚s art. In attempting to convey the
breadth of Palestine‚s artistic activity, the gallery will present an
installation of paintings and sculptures, a sound environment, and a rare
body performance by the artist.

Born in Brooklyn in 1947, Palestine‚s first musical experiences were as a
cantorial singer in the synagogues of New York. By the late 1960s, he was
deeply involved in the amazingly fertile New York and West Coast
experimental music/art community. His first major works were legendary piano
performances of epic durations, microtonal trembles and dense overtones
which situated him alongside La Monte Young, Terry Riley, Steve Reich and
others as a seminal figure of early minimalism.

In the early 1970s, Palestine increasingly extended his performances beyond
the scope of music. His groundbreaking appearances, which combined violent
piano playing, performance, video and installation, were considered to be
among the most radical musical and performance experiences. Palestine
produced a seminal body of performance-based, psychodramatic videotapes in
which he ritualistically used physicality, motion and sound to achieve an
outward articulation of internal states. Intense and often violently
charged, these exercises are characterized by a visceral enactment of
physical and psychological catharses.

Palestine‚s artistic concerns have also manifested themselves in countless
gallery installations. The publication of „Sacred Bordello‰ places
particular emphasis on this aspect of Palestine‚s work, which is often much
less known by American audiences, especially as Palestine has lived for
several years in Belgium and has exhibited primarily in Europe. His
signature assemblies of often-augmented stuffed animals, scarves, and
objects (collectively called „Charleworld‰ by the artist) convey both an
unruly flamboyance and a penetrating poignancy˜a duality which extends
through all of Palestine‚s varied activities.

The gallery installation will be open 10am-6pm on March 19th and 20th.
Please call 212-680-9889 for further information.

I doubt if anyone on this list would've heard of
him, but Stephen Tudor, my poetry mentor at Wayne
State, disappeared while sailing by himself in one
of the great lakes. It's unlikely that he "jumped
ship," however; more probably an accident. Those
waters get very rough.

Steven, thanks for reading these posts on Haiti, and thanks to Aldon for giving more info
on what to read.  Depestre is a poet that wrote what was considered a must read epic poem
called A Rainbow for the Christian West.  The book is out of print, I think, and only
available in French.  I believe that he lives in Paris if he is still alive.

Many of the upper class Haitians speak very good classical French, and write weirdly
wonderful books.  I think I must have read about twenty of these.  Some older great books
are by the Marcellin Brothers -- they won a fiction contest judged by Edmund Wilson in
the fifties and got famous through that.  They ended up in Paris, too.  The Beast of the
Haitian Hills is really great.  It's about a maid who pretends (?) to be taken over by a
vicious spirit and cows her master.

Steven, you are right that I said Haiti is a basket case.  I used the exact words that
Heather Williams criticized.

Oops.

I guess we should not give up on HAiti.  I haven't, not really, but I really don't know
where to start.  It's not as bad off as Rwanda, though, and there is still a functioning
downtown in many areas.

I would like to speed up human rights issues in all these little countries.  I have been
wondering if there is some way to give better aid to those country who are at least
trying to protect Locke's four basic freedoms.  I'm not talking about penalties, but just
bonuses and rewards.

We're back at the problem of relativism, but really women shouldn't be immolating
themselves as they are in Afghanistan, or being raped, or whatever.  The opposition
shouldn't be getting slaughtered.

We need more fairness, and we need a model of fairness that is overseen and drafted by
the UN, perhaps.

Perhaps everything could be based on the Finnish constitution.  I don't see how we can
began to criticize other countries, or clean up America without having a basic standard
of how a country ought to be behave.  Locke to me is better than Marx because I think
it's clearer, and actually leads to a higher status on the universal misery index.

Steven, I'm glad you pointed out that I had given up on Haiti.  As we read in future
weeks as to who did this, and whether or not we armed those thugs, -- if Bush had
something to do with this -- or even if his appointees did -- then he's a pig.  But I
think Baby Doc Duvalier has enough millions to buy guns to do his bidding for him.  And
maybe it's Baby Doc.  He's living in Miami.  I thought he was exiled to France, but I
guess he managed to get to Miami.

Ok, thanks to those of you interested in this marvelous little country of horrors and
splendours.  Cuba is very close to Haiti.  It looks like about sixty miles from one to
the other, but that's on my global map.  It may be further than that.  The original
reason we supported the Duvaliers is that they promised to never go communist.  Perhaps
there was a fear of Aristide going communist?  In a sense he had that liberation theology
thing going on.  But I don't know if he was trying to make the island into a socialist
country.  It's very hard to get accurate information, and the news is almost curiously
blase (blah-zay) about the whole deal, as if they've been told to play it down.

Kirby,

--as you know this is what I wrote to you earlier but mistakenly only emailed
to you--

I read you, and you appear to yearn for a sort of logic to the Haitian
travesty. Yet, you turn from an actual political situation to baiting theorists
and other sociological systems before spinning a religious yarn.

What does Lutheranism have to do with Haiti at the moment? What does Foucalt?
Barthes? Derrida? Kristeva? I have little interest in any of them. You seem to
argue for a democracy there, which is what the country had. Aristide was
democratically elected TWICE. The good people in Washington DC do not like
democratic results with which they do not agree. Witness what’s going on in
Iraq: if Iraqis were really allowed to vote, the government that would take
shape would have an Islamic leader. If he really believed in democratic
results, the US government would have protected the government of Aristide.
Let’s not even get into recount 2000 and the US Supreme Court’s decision.

I can’t believe that you’ve gotten me into this discussion. But, I’m done here.
I’m not going to debate with you the merits of Luther’s two kingdoms and its
value on Haiti because I do not want to hear next that Mel Gibson would be good
for Port-au-Prince.

--Ak

--Addendum—

You ask about John Locke. It’s been a quite a while since I took my modern
philosophy course, but I just took a few minutes to clarify some things for
myself.

Locke thought that “labor is the origin and justification of property; contract
or consent is the ground of government and fixes its limits.”  He thought that
once humanity multiplied land would become scarce and that rules would be
required beyond those of moral law. “Civil society originates when, for the
better administration of the law, men agree to delegate this function to
certain officers. Thus government is instituted by a ‘social contract’; its
powers are limited, and they involve reciprocal obligations; moreover, they can
be modified or rescinded by the authority which conferred them.” So, would
Locke approved a campaign of agitation and coup in Haiti? Just asking.

It does appear that you have a dismissive attitude towards Haitian “progress”
without crediting the heavy colonial influence in the region. I don’t want to
get into post-colonial theory, but the variable has to be considered.

I would like to throw Amartya Sen into the conversation and his approach re:
Reexamining Inequality. What’s more – in my opinion – these limitations,
deficiencies, ironies, human faults, errors, history, meddling, manipulation,
epistemology, politics, etc. would be best looked at in a more fluid platform
that a rigid paragraph and expository writing. This stuff is ripe for poetry,
no? Sen discusses wants to get past the old adage that “all men are created
equal” because it simply isn’t true and it doesn’t do us much good. He argues
for a society that allows for the individual to reach one’s individual
capabilities and freedom to achieve one’s objectives/goals. Rawls is involved
in all of this, too.

(gotta go now).

      Friends,

      I accepted Augie's backchanneled apology, for what it's worth. In all
honesty, I couldn't even figure out what he was talking about in the
original "attack," so i searched for "Leviticus" in the archives of the
Multistory list.  Appended is his message and my response -- does it look
like my "fundamentalist buttons" were pushed?  At all?

      You know, I once talked to Augie on the phone and found him very sweet
spirited.  He certainly does love his daughter (who then had been born
recently) and wife, as he claims. And he very enthusiastically encouraged me
in my own work.  But I find M.A.G. radically weird -- it seems that the only
criterion there is expansion.  I can't for the life of me locate an
editorial standard in the work published there.  I believe it's intended to
reflect internet culture, or spam culture, a kind of in-box of poetry,
comment, and miscellaneous texts and modeling headshots. I sometmies laugh
at the send-ups but rarely have the energy to comb through much of the
actual writing.   As to Augie's own poetry -- net writing often comes across
as very flat, so I am prejudiced in my criticism there.  Do people really
enjoy reading long, automatically generated poems?  I don't.

      I think "ad hominem" is a very good distinction to make between what's
acceptable and unacceptable in email list discussions. Better to engage
someone's work than someone's personality, especially when it comes to art
and writing--- so many of us are so fucked up.  This ain't a garden party.
So, while i embrace Augie himself, I don't necessarily embrace his work.
"Love the sinner, hate the sin," as we Fundamentalist Buttons say.

      August,

      It's not a matter of being offended, just that "stability yes fuck"
seems formless and void. Like I said-- it seems like regurgitation. At least
with ancient sacrifice, there was prescribed form and ritual. If you have
something foul to present, at least shape it, show some nuance, some ironic
tension, right?

      No, not at all a matter of being offended, August! Bring on the blood
and guts.

Re-familiarizing myself with these logical fallacies has reminded me what a
joy logic can be.

Isn't the very concept of "ad hominem" a relic from a bygone era, though?
Can an objection of "ad hominem" really stand in light of postmodernism?

              But we become aware of it only

    When the book is closed we suddenly recognize an alphabet
under subjugation.














































    “How does one keep these erasures under scrutiny?”

    By imagining the last word.













































    The first erasure. What develops from the first and only wound.
    An alphabet. What is posited against the first letter.



































              Thus absence speaks to absence.
























































    The book is opened.

    The poem opens and ends and returns
to begin again.

    The book is opened and deprived of its memory.










































    The book is opened.

    We cannot read the book because it is already imagined.
What is written in the margins of its memory.

    The book is opened and is no longer listening.










































    To reason when one is no longer
listening. That to mean is to be actively ambivalent.

Kirby,

below another take on Haiti: Naom Chomsky recent piece on that subject=20=

from Z-Net:

Pierre


US-Haiti
  =A0
By Noam Chomsky
=A0
Those who have any concern for Haiti will naturally want to understand=20=

how its most recent tragedy has been unfolding. And for those who have=20=

had the privilege of any contact with the people of this tortured land,=20=

it is not just natural but inescapable. Nevertheless, we make a serious=20=

error if we focus too narrowly on the events of the recent past, or=20
even on Haiti alone. The crucial issue for us is what we should be=20
doing about what is taking place. That would be true even if our=20
options and our responsibility were limited; far more so when they are=20=

immense and decisive, as in the case of Haiti. And even more so because=20=

the course of the terrible story was predictable years ago -- if we=20
failed to act to prevent it. And fail we did. The lessons are clear,=20
and so important that they would be the topic of daily front-page=20
articles in a free press.
=A0
Reviewing what was taking place in Haiti shortly after Clinton=20
"restored democracy" in 1994, I was compelled to conclude, unhappily,=20
in Z Magazine that "It would not be very surprising, then, if the=20
Haitian operations become another catastrophe," and if so, "It is not a=20=

difficult chore to trot out the familiar phrases that will explain the=20=

failure of our mission of benevolence in this failed society." The=20
reasons were evident to anyone who chose to look. And the familiar=20
phrases again resound, sadly and predictably.
=A0
There is much solemn discussion today explaining, correctly, that=20
democracy means more than flipping a lever every few years. Functioning=20=

democracy has preconditions. One is that the population should have=20
some way to learn what is happening in the world. The real world, not=20
the self-serving portrait offered by the "establishment press," which=20
is disfigured by its "subservience to state power" and "the usual=20
hostility to popular movements" - the accurate words of Paul Farmer,=20
whose work on Haiti is, in its own way, perhaps even as remarkable as=20
what he has accomplished within the country. Farmer was writing in=20
1993, reviewing mainstream commentary and reporting on Haiti, a=20
disgraceful record that goes back to the days of Wilson's vicious and=20
destructive invasion in 1915, and on to the present. The facts are=20
extensively documented, appalling, and shameful. And they are deemed=20
irrelevant for the usual reasons: they do not conform to the required=20
self-image, and so are efficiently dispatched deep into the memory=20
hole, though they can be unearthed by those who have some interest in=20
the real world.
=A0
They will rarely be found, however, in the "establishment press."=20
Keeping to the more liberal and knowledgeable end of the spectrum, the=20=

standard version is that in "failed states" like Haiti and Iraq the US=20=

must become engaged in benevolent "nation-building" to "enhance=20
democracy," a "noble goal" but one that may be beyond our means because=20=

of the inadequacies of the objects of our solicitude. In Haiti, despite=20=

Washington's dedicated efforts from Wilson to FDR while the country was=20=

under Marine occupation, "the new dawn of Haitian democracy never=20
came." And "not all America's good wishes, nor all its Marines, can=20
achieve [democracy today] until the Haitians do it themselves" (H.D.S.=20=

Greenway, Boston Globe). As New York Times correspondent R.W. Apple=20
recounted two centuries of history in 1994, reflecting on the prospects=20=

for Clinton's endeavor to "restore democracy" then underway, "Like the=20=

French in the 19th century, like the Marines who occupied Haiti from=20
1915 to 1934, the American forces who are trying to impose a new order=20=

will confront a complex and violent society with no history of=20
democracy."
=A0
Apple does appear to go a bit beyond the norm in his reference to=20
Napoleon's savage assault on Haiti, leaving it in ruins, in order to=20
prevent the crime of liberation in the world's richest colony, the=20
source of much of France's wealth. But perhaps that undertaking too=20
satisfies the fundamental criterion of benevolence: it was supported by=20=

the United States, which was naturally outraged and frightened by "the=20=

first nation in the world to argue the case of universal freedom for=20
all humankind, revealing the limited definition of freedom adopted by=20
the French and American revolutions." So Haitian historian Patrick=20
Bellegarde-Smith writes, accurately describing the terror in the slave=20=

state next door, which was not relieved even when Haiti's successful=20
liberation struggle, at enormous cost, opened the way to the expansion=20=

to the West by compelling Napoleon to accept the Louisiana Purchase.=20
The US continued to do what it could to strangle Haiti, even supporting=20=

France's insistence that Haiti pay a huge indemnity for the crime of=20
liberating itself, a burden it has never escaped - and France, of=20
course, dismisses with elegant disdain Haiti's request, recently under=20=

Aristide, that it at least repay the indemnity, forgetting the=20
responsibilities that a civilized society would accept.
=A0
The basic contours of what led to the current tragedy are pretty clear.=20=

Just beginning with the 1990 election of Aristide (far too narrow a=20
time frame), Washington was appalled by the election of a populist=20
candidate with a grass-roots constituency just as it had been appalled=20=

by the prospect of the hemisphere's first free country on its doorstep=20=

two centuries earlier. Washington's traditional allies in Haiti=20
naturally agreed. "The fear of democracy exists, by definitional=20
necessity, in elite groups who monopolize economic and political=20
power," Bellegarde-Smith observes in his perceptive history of Haiti;=20
whether in Haiti or the US or anywhere else.
=A0
The threat of democracy in Haiti in 1991 was even more ominous because=20=

of the favorable reaction of the international financial institutions=20
(World Bank, IADB) to Aristide's programs, which awakened traditional=20
concerns over the "virus" effect of successful independent development.=20=

These are familiar themes in international affairs: American=20
independence aroused similar concerns among European leaders. The=20
dangers are commonly perceived to be particularly grave in a country=20
like Haiti, which had been ravaged by France and then reduced to utter=20=

misery by a century of US intervention. If even people in such dire=20
circumstances can take their fate into their own hands, who knows what=20=

might happen elsewhere as the "contagion spreads."
=A0
The Bush I administration reacted to the disaster of democracy by=20
shifting aid from the democratically elected government to what are=20
called "democratic forces": the wealthy elites and the business=20
sectors, who, along with the murderers and torturers of the military=20
and paramilitaries, had been lauded by the current incumbents in=20
Washington, in their Reaganite phase, for their progress in "democratic=20=

development," justifying lavish new aid. The praise came in response to=20=

ratification by the Haitian parliament of a law granting Washington's=20
client killer and torturer Baby Doc Duvalier the authority to suspend=20
the rights of any political party without reasons. The law passed by a=20=

majority of 99.98%. It therefore marked a positive step towards=20
democracy as compared with the 99% approval of a 1918 law granting US=20
corporations the right to turn the country into a US plantation, passed=20=

by 5% of the population after the Haitian Parliament was disbanded at=20
gunpoint by Wilson's Marines when it refused to accept this=20
"progressive measure," essential for "economic development." Their=20
reaction to Baby Doc's encouraging progress towards democracy was=20
characteristic - worldwide -- on the part of the visionaries who are=20
now entrancing educated opinion with their dedication to bringing=20
democracy to a suffering world - although, to be sure, their actual=20
exploits are being tastefully rewritten to satisfy current needs.
=A0
Refugees fleeing to the US from the terror of the US-backed=20
dictatorships were forcefully returned, in gross violation of=20
international humanitarian law. The policy was reversed when a=20
democratically elected government took office. Though the flow of=20
refugees reduced to a trickle, they were mostly granted political=20
asylum. Policy returned to normal when a military junta overthrew the=20
Aristide government after seven months, and state terrorist atrocities=20=

rose to new heights. The perpetrators were the army - the inheritors of=20=

the National Guard left by Wilson's invaders to control the population=20=

- and its paramilitary forces. The most important of these, FRAPH, was=20=

founded by CIA asset Emmanuel Constant, who now lives happily in=20
Queens, Clinton and Bush II having dismissed extradition requests --=20
because he would reveal US ties to the murderous junta, it is widely=20
assumed. Constant's contributions to state terror were, after all,=20
meager; merely prime responsibility for the murder of 4-5000 poor=20
blacks.
=A0
Recall the core element of the Bush doctrine, which has "already become=20=

a de facto rule of international relations," Harvard's Graham Allison=20
writes in Foreign Affairs: "those who harbor terrorists are as guilty=20
as the terrorists themselves," in the President's words, and must be=20
treated accordingly, by large-scale bombing and invasion.
=A0
When Aristide was overthrown by the 1991 military coup, the=20
Organization of American States declared an embargo. Bush I announced=20
that the US would violate it by exempting US firms. He was thus "fine=20
tuning" the embargo for the benefit of the suffering population, the=20
New York Times reported. Clinton authorized even more extreme=20
violations of the embargo: US trade with the junta and its wealthy=20
supporters sharply increased. The crucial element of the embargo was,=20
of course, oil. While the CIA solemnly testified to Congress that the=20
junta "probably will be out of fuel and power very shortly" and "Our=20
intelligence efforts are focused on detecting attempts to circumvent=20
the embargo and monitoring its impact," Clinton secretly authorized the=20=

Texaco Oil Company to ship oil to the junta illegally, in violation of=20=

presidential directives. This remarkable revelation was the lead story=20=

on the AP wires the day before Clinton sent the Marines to "restore=20
democracy," impossible to miss - I happened to be monitoring AP wires=20
that day and saw it repeated prominently over and over -- and obviously=20=

of enormous significance for anyone who wanted to understand what was=20
happening. It was suppressed with truly impressive discipline, though=20
reported in industry journals along with scant mention buried in the=20
business press.
=A0
Also efficiently suppressed were the crucial conditions that Clinton=20
imposed for Aristide's return: that he adopt the program of the=20
defeated US candidate in the 1990 elections, a former World Bank=20
official who had received 14% of the vote. We call this "restoring=20
democracy," a prime illustration of how US foreign policy has entered a=20=

"noble phase" with a "saintly glow," the national press explained. The=20=

harsh neoliberal program that Aristide was compelled to adopt was=20
virtually guaranteed to demolish the remaining shreds of economic=20
sovereignty, extending Wilson's progressive legislation and similar=20
US-imposed measures since.
=A0
As democracy was thereby restored, the World Bank announced that "The=20
renovated state must focus on an economic strategy centered on the=20
energy and initiative of Civil Society, especially the private sector,=20=

both national and foreign." That has the merit of honesty: Haitian=20
Civil Society includes the tiny rich elite and US corporations, but not=20=

the vast majority of the population, the peasants and slum-dwellers who=20=

had committed the grave sin of organizing to elect their own president.=20=

World Bank officers explained that the neoliberal program would benefit=20=

the "more open, enlightened, business class" and foreign investors, but=20=

assured us that the program "is not going to hurt the poor to the=20
extent it has in other countries" subjected to structural adjustment,=20
because the Haitian poor already lacked minimal protection from proper=20=

economic policy, such as subsidies for basic goods. Aristide's Minister=20=

in charge of rural development and agrarian reform was not notified of=20=

the plans to be imposed on this largely peasant society, to be returned=20=

by "America's good wishes" to the track from which it veered briefly=20
after the regrettable democratic election in 1990.
=A0
Matters then proceeded in their predictable course. A 1995 USAID report=20=

explained that the "export-driven trade and investment policy" that=20
Washington imposed will "relentlessly squeeze the domestic rice=20
farmer," who will be forced to turn to agroexport, with incidental=20
benefits to US agribusiness and investors. Despite their extreme=20
poverty, Haitian rice farmers are quite efficient, but cannot possibly=20=

compete with US agribusiness, even if it did not receive 40% of its=20
profits from government subsidies, sharply increased under the=20
Reaganites who are again in power, still producing enlightened rhetoric=20=

about the miracles of the market. We now read that Haiti cannot feed=20
itself, another sign of a "failed state."
=A0
A few small industries were still able to function, for example, making=20=

chicken parts. But US conglomerates have a large surplus of dark meat,=20=

and therefore demanded the right to dump their excess products in=20
Haiti. They tried to do the same in Canada and Mexico too, but there=20
illegal dumping could be barred. Not in Haiti, compelled to submit to=20
efficient market principles by the US government and the corporations=20
it serves.
=A0
One might note that the Pentagon's proconsul in Iraq, Paul Bremer,=20
ordered a very similar program to be instituted there, with the same=20
beneficiaries in mind. That's also called "enhancing democracy." In=20
fact, the record, highly revealing and important, goes back to the 18th=20=

century. Similar programs had a large role in creating today's third=20
world. Meanwhile the powerful ignored the rules, except when they could=20=

benefit from them, and were able to become rich developed societies;=20
dramatically the US, which led the way in modern protectionism and,=20
particularly since World War II, has relied crucially on the dynamic=20
state sector for innovation and development, socializing risk and cost.
=A0
The punishment of Haiti became much more severe under Bush II -- there=20=

are differences within the narrow spectrum of cruelty and greed. Aid=20
was cut and international institutions were pressured to do likewise,=20
under pretexts too outlandish to merit discussion. They are extensively=20=

reviewed in Paul Farmer's Uses of Haiti, and in some current press=20
commentary, notably by Jeffrey Sachs (Financial Times) and Tracy Kidder=20=

(New York Times).
=A0
Putting details aside, what has happened since is eerily similar to the=20=

overthrow of Haiti's first democratic government in 1991. The Aristide=20=

government, once again, was undermined by US planners, who understood,=20=

under Clinton, that the threat of democracy can be overcome if economic=20=

sovereignty is eliminated, and presumably also understood that economic=20=

development will also be a faint hope under such conditions, one of the=20=

best-confirmed lessons of economic history. Bush II planners are even=20
more dedicated to undermining democracy and independence, and despised=20=

Aristide and the popular organizations that swept him to power with=20
perhaps even more passion than their predecessors. The forces that=20
reconquered the country are mostly inheritors of the US-installed army=20=

and paramilitary terrorists.
=A0
Those who are intent on diverting attention from the US role will=20
object that the situation is more complex -- as is always true -- and=20
that Aristide too was guilty of many crimes. Correct, but if he had=20
been a saint the situation would hardly have developed very=20
differently, as was evident in 1994, when the only real hope was that a=20=

democratic revolution in the US would make it possible to shift policy=20=

in a more civilized direction.
=A0
What is happening now is awful, maybe beyond repair. And there is=20
plenty of short-term responsibility on all sides. But the right way for=20=

the US and France to proceed is very clear. They should begin with=20
payment of enormous reparations to Haiti (France is perhaps even more=20
hypocritical and disgraceful in this regard than the US). That,=20
however, requires construction of functioning democratic societies in=20
which, at the very least, people have a prayer of knowing what's going=20=

on. Commentary on Haiti, Iraq, and other "failed societies" is quite=20
right in stressing the importance of overcoming the "democratic=20
deficit" that substantially reduces the significance of elections. It=20
does not, however, draw the obvious corollary: the lesson applies in=20
spades to a country where "politics is the shadow cast on society by=20
big business," in the words of America's leading social philosopher,=20
John Dewey, describing his own country in days when the blight had=20
spread nowhere near as far as it has today.
=A0
For those who are concerned with the substance of democracy and human=20
rights, the basic tasks at home are also clear enough. They have been=20
carried out before, with no slight success, and under incomparably=20
harsher conditions elsewhere, including the slums and hills of Haiti.=20
We do not have to submit, voluntary, to living in a failed state=20
suffering from an enormous democratic deficit.

I was glad to see a review of this book, which I totally enjoy--last
time I read it I found myself laughing aloud with delight.

Subject: Reading ~Black Dog Songs~ by Lisa Jarnot

The praise for ~Black Dog Songs,~ and that it's listed
as one of the two top best-selling poetry titles at
SPDBooks, is well-deserved.  It's a singularly unique
reading experience.

I was reminded throughout of a poet I haven't yet
heard invoked in comparison: Edgar Allan Poe's poetry.
  It's probably not since his that we've seen a
consciousness combining such an oxymoronic, seemingly
mutually exclusive combustion: ear concentrated to an
Ulalume pitch, the political, and the sinister.

The most surprising moment came, for me, at the very
end, in the title poem, where all the book's themes
are suddenly noded into one and explained in a single
word, a point of synthesis I couldn't have foreseen:
the word "kill", appearing like a free-floating
disjunctive unconscious imperative in the mind of the
dog that's lullabied: "the foxes and / road kill all
wander / the highway / . . . / I know the road kill, /
the flies know the / road kill".   That, then, is both
the exhausting instinct that the poor dog has to be
lulled to sleep from ("Go to sleep little doggie") and
that explains---perhaps making more forgiveable in
their powerlessness against such deep-rooted
drives?---the George W, Bush, Dick Cheney, and Donald
Rumsfeld whom poems are dedicated to.  It isn't just
that the Colonel Sanders on the rotisseries ("The
chicken wing factory is lit up in flames"), in what
fast may be becoming the most-quoted poem of the early
21st century, are martyrs of pathetic victimization,
---except in some vegan utopia.  To the contrary: if
we didn't kill them, the dogs would.

I'm glad that the book is popular, but I'm surprised
that it isn't controversial.

The final, surprising black-&-white photograph that
follows the last poem makes explicit, perhaps in spite
of itself, a pathos that the poetry couldn't state:
it's all frozen over (the photo shows the walkway of a
pier leading out to its endpoint over a lake or bay,
the pier and the lake completely iced-over in winter
and the ice thick in several inches of snow), and the
reason that remained unstated was that ~so little was
or *can* be stated~ in a poetry like ours that has
been hyper-musicalized devoid of both propositional
statements and the risk of falsity and possibility of
truth that they hold ("for Dick Cheney": "dim dale /
ding dong / dip down / dame chase / cheap date / dance
dodge / do dick" [see "The Autobiography of Donald
Rumsfeld" by Anselm Berrigan, in Baffling Comubstions
# 2: "hand painfinite droolted / to vaguely
cutiepiefuzzfacesemble / who-ever's infinite drool
racket / suckinfinite droolg iced" (sic)]).
Historically, periods when literature reached ratios
of low semantics/high melopoeia were monarchic
imperialisms typified by the so-called "Decadent"
poets or, when the term was still value-neutral, the
French ~precieux~ poets.  Writing Degree Zero has
reached its sub-sub-zero Kelvin point in the must-read
~Black Dog Songs.~

When I first heard ~Black Dog Songs~ poems, before
reading the book, they "blew my mind" (cognitive
dissonance): there was an actual ~physical~ sensation,
a sort of tingling in my limbs, as my mind couldn't
solve their dilemma. I was most reminded of Robert
Ryman's all-white paintings.  Before reading the book,
I was more ambivalent or confused about Jarnot poetry.
  What shorted out all my receptive circuitry was that
the selfsame poems could simultaneously be read, as
Ron Silliman says, as an expression of one of the most
sensitive "ears" in American poetry and a distillation
of everything to the most ~pure~ possible of all
~poesie pure,~ an expression of great faith in
poetry--- ~or~ a hoax of the most cynical and taunting
type, there only to make fun of what's in vogue.  If
someone wanted to make a bad joke of poetry, it might
wind up a bad version of these good poems.  Without
outside context to corroborate its sincerity, a reader
could understandably be quite incredulous at the
Philip Glass minimalism of "Because the trees all
lived / there too.  Because the trees and roots knew
harmony.  / Because the burning cutters knew the trees
and hungered / for the crops.  Because the trees were
tired", in a poem with no less than ~twenty-two~
anaphora "Because" sentences ---which is reminiscent
of nothing so much as the typings of Robert Wilson's
(autistic) librettist Christopher Knowles (go to:

http://www.epc.buffalo.edu/sound/mp3/sp/dial_a_poem_poets/big_ego/05-wilson.mp3).


(The book could be compared and contrasted valuably to
another recent poet of repetition largely forgotten
from the canon: John Giorno.)

Afterwards, I found myself wondering at how the book
is triangulated among the bad father figures of a
wicked Bush-Cheney-Rumsfeld patriarchy and the good
innocence of lambs and animals or child-like nursery
rhyme allusions, but ~without any female figure~
whatsoever to complete that into a known feminism.

Initially, I was surprised when Ron Silliman praised
Jarnot's "ear."  I hadn't heard her writing that way.
And I wondered at how so wide a difference of
perspective could exist. From the sound of what he
says about his music-listening habits, Ron Silliman
seems like a New Age Steve Reich trance music type.
My listening habits are very different from that:
Boulez is the composer I think of first as the example
of a literal "perfect pitch" composer, and I tend to
think of "ear" as being demonstrated by ~variety,~ not
sameness.  Maybe, if that's the kind of music that he
looks to as a summit model of what's good, Silliman's
estimation would be understandable, I thought.  And,
of course, ~Black Dog Songs~ is reiterated sameness
~with slight variation,~ encouraging the reader to
attune more to subtle changes.

I had a friend who was in charge of book cover design
at a major publishing house, who spent his days doing
nothing but evaluating fine gradations of color and
who was ~professionally~ over-sensitize to it; and he
lived in an apartment where everything was white,
including the cats, and for a while he dressed in only
whites and off-whites.  Clear evidence of an acutely
heightened sensitivity can also be found in cases
where stimuli are then kept, defensively, at an
absolute minimum.

Maybe the proof of Jarnot's "ear" is to be found, the
way "kill" seemed to sum it all up, in a single word,
too: "dog", in the book's very title.  It took me a
while for it to dawn on me that, by singling out that
basic ABCs word to be writ large on the book's cover,
she had chosen one of the few words most equivocally
pronounced in English.  So evenly split is its
pronunciation, in fact, that the ~American Heritage
College Dictionary~ accounts for it with ~two~
pronunciations: either with a short o as in "box" or
with an aw sound (my regional prounciation) as in
"dawn."

The opening of John Ashbery's "The New Spirit" in
~Three Poems~ is often quoted: "I thought htat if I
could put it all down, that would be one way.  And
next the thought came to me that to leave all out
would be another, and truer, way."  Finally, here is
that heretofore only dreamt-of New Spirit poetry that
leaves almost everything out.

I'm very glad I read it, and I recommend ~Black Dog
Songs.~

False Alarms of Big Ideas
(For Spalding Gray and Aaron Belz)


Gore Vidal screams
as Gray jumps off Point Judith
to search for termites
making messy dough
from the world's foundation

Still dizzy for the taste
of jailbirds kissing goofs
in plays on Long Island Ferry -

Lanky with a pretzel;
clocking reckless booze -

To travel to himself
for a seat above the snapshot -
and direct his darkest work -

Typically, fine tuned.

didn't Berryman jump off a bridge?

Mary Wollstonecraft jumped into the Thames I think twice, but
unsuccessfully.  Her daughter by Gilbert Imlay did so successfully.

i don't know that this counts, but Percy Shelley took himself and a
friend, Edward Williams, out in a boat on a clearly inclement day, and his
body later washed ashore.  the legend has it that when the body was
burned, the heart remained untouched.

Warning: Blogs Can Be Infectious

   By [17]Amit Asaravala

   Story location:
   [18]http://www.wired.com/news/culture/0,1284,62537,00.html

   02:00 AM Mar. 05, 2004 PT

   The most-read webloggers aren't necessarily the ones with the most
   original ideas, say researchers at Hewlett-Packard Labs.

   Using newly developed techniques for graphing the flow of information
   between blogs, the researchers have discovered that authors of popular
   blog sites regularly borrow topics from lesser-known bloggers -- and
   they often do so without attribution.

   These findings are important to sociologists who are interested in
   learning how ideas grow from isolated topics into full-blown epidemics
   that "infect" large populations. Such an understanding is also
   important to marketers, who hope to be able to pitch products and
   ideas directly to the most influential people in a given group.

   "There is a lot of speculation that really important people are highly
   connected, but really, we wonder if the highly connected people just
   listen to the important people," said Lada Adamic, one of the four
   researchers working on the project.

   To satisfy their curiosity, the researchers began analyzing data from
   Intelliseek's [21]BlogPulse Web crawler, which regularly mines
   thousands of blogs for references to people, places and events.

   When they plotted the links and topics shared by various sites, they
   discovered that topics would often appear on a few relatively unknown
   blogs days before they appeared on more popular sites.

   "What we're finding is that the important people on the Web are not
   necessarily the people with the most explicit links (back to their
   sites), but the people who cause epidemics in blog networks," said
   researcher Eytan Adar.

   These infectious people can be hard to find because they do not always
   receive attribution for being the first to point to an interesting
   idea or news item.

   Indeed, the team at HP Labs found that when an idea infected at least
   10 blogs, 70 percent of the blogs did not provide links back to
   another blog that had previously mentioned the idea.

   To get past this obstacle, the researchers developed techniques to
   infer where information might have come from, based on the
   similarities in text, links and infection rates.

   For instance, if Blog A used the words "furry germs" to link to an
   infectious topic like [22]Giantmicrobes just days after Blog B in the
   same social circle used the exact same words and link, that would be a
   good sign that Blog A copied Blog B.

   The researchers have incorporated their techniques into a search
   algorithm they call iRank. Unlike Google's [23]PageRank algorithm,
   which ranks websites based on overall popularity, the iRank algorithm
   ranks sites based on how good they are at injecting ideas into the
   mainstream.

   "A lot of sites that get listed by search engines as most relevant are
   not always the most relevant," said Adar. "For instance, Slashdot
   often gets listed at the top, but it's just an aggregator. I may want
   to go to the source."

   Adar and Adamic say it's too soon to tell if iRank will be
   incorporated into popular search engines.

   For one thing, they plan to refine the algorithm after seeing how it
   works on more data. They would also like to modify the algorithm to
   resist manipulation from Google-bomb-type attacks, where collaborators
   link to each other's sites to boost themselves in Google's ranking
   mechanism.

   In the meantime, the team has made some of its research available
   online in the form of the [24]Blog Epidemic Analyzer, a Java program
   that reveals the implicit and inferred links between blogs in an
   interactive, visual form.

   "Blogs are helping us get a better understanding of how things happen
   on the Internet," said Adar. "We're hopeful that in being able to do
   this research, we can apply the technology to other information, like
   e-mail, to improve productivity."

I thought Berryman umped out a window, but I could be wrong.  I'll check the
biograaphy I have.

ObBerryman Poem:

 I've found out why, that day, that suicide
 From the Empire State falling on someone's car
 Troubled you so; and why we quarrelled. War,
 Illness, an accident, I can see (you cried)
 But not this: What a bastard, not spring wide! . .
 I said a man, life in his teeth, could care
 Not much just whom he spat it on. . and far
 Beyond my laugh we argued either side.

 'One has a right not to be fallen on! . .'
 (Our second meeting. . yellow you were wearing.)
 Voices of our resistance and desire!
 Did I divine then I must shortly run
 Crazy with need to fall on you, despairing?
 Did you bolt so, before it caught, our fire?

Interesting that he said "one has a right not to be fallen on."

I did an essay on Suicide, Art, and Humor, using Berryman as my primary
example, which is on

Aaron, when I initially introduced the problem of the ad hominem attack on the
board six months ago, it was out of a mischievous sense of humor over the fact
that almost all arguments in the humanities are now ad hominem.  That is to say
that "standpoint" politics is ALL ABOUT Ad hominem argumentation.  You are
rich, so you don't know what you are talking about.  You are white and male, so
please die.  Rarely are the messages this foregrounded, but this is the
background message.  Classical argumentation assumed that everyone was invited
to speak in the community of thinkers -- even though of course many were not --
minorities, women, etc., were often left out of the critical discourse because
of these "standpoints," while the white Christian male was the presumed
speaker.  Now this is reversed, or so it seems to me.  But the ideal is to
listen to another as if they share the same humanity as yourself.

If we scroll back to Lockean humanism this is possible.  But in Marxism
everybody is always already identified, and we are supposed to either be in
favor of them (minority, with a mental problem, and poor, for instance, means
we had better listen, whereas able-bodied, Republican, means they are a reptile
no matter what they are saying).

If we listened to almost any of the classical grammars on argumentation, the
humanities as they are currently being practiced would vanish.  But the
classical grammars come out of liberalism.  The humanities now are so infused
with race, gender, and class (all means of ad hominem dismissal or acceptance
-- and all of which lean heavily on Marxism) that the classical grammars and
all of their terminology are no longer used.

Even the idea of logic is considered to be a white male phenomenon.  For me, of
course, it is a little hard to do without.  But then I'm a white male. Even
though I struggle with logic. Throwing out logic, or throwing out Locke, or
throwing out the baby Jesus, is throwing out the baby with the bathwater.
Western civilization had some good things going for it, even though we've hit
the third world pretty hard, and in some cases such as Haiti seem to be
continuing to do so (I haven't read the Chomsky piece yet).

(yurdleayydhyihu)...

      U R N E D A B A L I I Y T

*
Many Calls for Unreadable ("poemy call")

what's the first thing that came to mind?
Hegel to Danielle Steel, Robert Frost to Khlebnikov.
how would you do both find/make/provoke poetry
      *and* _____ Unread.(rhymes with 'deed')
A doing against the grain with eyes and words.
Read the unread? Unread the read?
        is this negating? deforming?  transformative? political
(as our desires are marketed to and resolutely slip away)?
something-something-something i can't read?
the hole in every whole?
where the ink ran.
what *was* the first thing that came to mind?
readability but unreadability, inside out.
rust patterns resolve to letters. ever sent.
this candle is inadequate.
unreadability is unanswered here,
this is just the call after all just the call,
you send the work calling back, unreadably.


      N U E R A D A I B L I T Y

This is a show / gathering / performance / publication on several
levels -- here are the parts of the hole

      U N R A E D A L I B I T Y

*
May 19th, a Wednesday - 8pm - $3
__Language Harm__ is a odd-months-only event at eyedrum, hosted by the
a.p.g. The theme will be UNREADABILITY.  looking for poetry works that
could be projected during the event (a 2nd night could be added for
more poetry films or animations if enough come in).

      R U N E A D A I L B I T Y

*
Unnamed Unreadable Poetry Show - a week or more in May overlapping the
above.
...this will be a very transient exhibit.  there is going to be a large
art show going on in eyedrum's space and other large rooms in the
building.  i propose to post an exhibit of unreadable poetry in one of
the side hallways.  these will all be standard  sized page printouts of
attachments -- nothing will be returned to you -- (but it will be
documented on the Perforations site with screen sized versions of all
the pieces submitted & submitter's names and links & bios and such)

      Y U N R E A D A B I I L T

Perforations issue -
...interested in waxing unreadable on unreadability?  here is the best
place for this.

      U R N E A B A D L I T I Y

*
Limited Edition publication from THE NAMELESS
...the plan is to do a small edition box -- perhaps 50 copies of it --
with a CD of material from the show -- a different selection of pages
in each box -- a unique cut piece of a large work of unreadable
art/poetry (to be made during performance / projection night, May 19)
-- other unmentionable unreadables -- each box with unique mixture of
works


      U R N E D A A B I L T I Y

HOW TO SEND AND WHAT TO SEND, WHERE

There will be not only the PERFORATIONS release, but also an event
called UNREADABLE at eyedrum art and music gallery. Co-editors for both
events will be Robert Cheatham, zeug1@earthlink.net, and John Lowther,

MIME-Version: 1.0

Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

Pierre, this is a very powerful article by Chomsky.  I'm afraid that I
agree with him for once.

I didn't realize that Clinton had broken the oil embargo. The real ruling
power in Haiti is the "shadow of the business elites" as Dewey so astutely
said.  This has been so since Wilson's invasion.  What Wilson apparently
thought -- was that Haiti needed foreign financal input in order to grow --
but the Haitian constitution had forbidden that anybody outside of Haiti
could own Haitian land.  Small tenant farmers growing yams and such could
live a basic sustenance existence until Wilson's men rewrote the Haitian
constitution to say that anybody could own Haitian land.  All the most
arable land was immediately sold to international corporations -- and now
there are huge agricultural companies that own most of the Haitian land.
German companies own a lot of Haitian land, too.  All the tiny tenant
farmers were kicked out, and mostly went to live in the slums of cities.

It's not just money that needs to be given to these people.  They need
their land back.  But huge foreign concerns are sucking too much money out
of Haiti, and unless you're in bed with those concerns at the highest
level, you are dead in Haiti.  Because most of those gigantic agricultural
concerns are growing inedible products like coffee and sugar cane food has
to be imported, and so it is actually quite expensive.

How to get these blood-sucking companies out of Haiti?  It won't be easy.
It would be like getting America to give the land back to the Indians, at
this point.  It won't happen.  Aristide must have frightened them somewhat,
so they had him removed.

One of the only things I disagreed with in Chomsky's article is when he
used "Washington" as a single subject.  I think there are hundreds of
thousands of politicians in Washington, and at least some of them must be
sympathetic to Haiti.  Who was the African-American woman who ran for the
Democratic candidacy?  She's a senator, as I recall, seemed fairly bright.
Surely she's concerned.  Surely Al Sharpton's concerned.  Surely there are
a handful of even Republicans who would like to do what is fair and right
in Haiti.  There was a time when Haiti was being considered to be added to
the US as a state.  They voted it down.  So it isn't as if we are against
them, or have always been.  WE wanted to incorporate them. Had they been
incorporated they would have been better off, in some ways.

I hadn't heard of Paul Farmer's book.  I will try to get one from Amazon.

Thanks, Pierre.

Oh, one note to Anastasios -- Aristide and Mel Gibson are both Catholics.
They probably would see eye to eye on many issues.  I'm a Lutheran, a
believer in the Protestant work ethic and all that.  It's a different
paradigm.  I'm assuming you're Greek Orthodox at least in origin, due to
your name.  I wasn't sure what you were getting at when you said you didn't
want to see Mel Gibson as the answer to Haiti, or something.  I thought
this was a flame, actually, and I hope that you were punished.  Mel is
alive, and so am I, I believe, and it seemed you were making fun of us!

berryman jumped from the footbridge over the mississippi joining the
"west bank" (social science area) from the "east bank" (humanities
etc) of the U of MN.  he landed not in the river,though, but on the
road that runs alongside the west bank.  in front of a car.  i can
show visitors the spot when they come through if desired.

do you like poems because of their "sound"?
is that of primary importance?
is it more important than what a poem "says"?
or even what a poem does?

does anybody else feel that many poems that are distinguished as great
by virtue of the writer's "EAR"
often fall flat (for you personally)?

if so, does this mean you have a "tin ear"?
or haven't learned the proper rules of verse? even "free verse"?

does it make you question the value of the term "ear"?
or "music"?
at least as a term used to distinguish a "great" or "sublime" poem
from an allegedly not-so-great one?

is it possible that many of the defenses of a poem's greatness
on the grounds of the "ear"
are partially because the poem in question
does not do much else except use language in "musical" ways?

is it possible that poems that engage more blatantly
in ways that could be recognized as emotionally or intellectually intense
are often said to lack said "EAR"--
not because they really do---
but because it becomes harder to distinguish "music"
from "feeling" or "thought" or "personality" or "performativity"?

if you want to be called a poet, do you have to appeal
to what's called the "ear" by those who divide the "ear"
from other "body parts"?

do you have to develop a systematic, or at least an eloquent non-systematic,
prose defense of YOUR KIND OF "MUSIC"
when it's not "SEEN" (or "READ") as "music"
by many of the NOISIEST spokespeople for what's called poetry today?

what is really meant by "ear" and "music" when so many of the poems
or pieces of writing you're most interested in are over and over again
considered "clunky" by "musical" standards put forth either by
many who squeak (i mean speak) for what used to be called "avant-garde" or
"mainstream"?

is it put forth, in many cases, as an attempt to "mystify"?
is it perhaps, as a standard, even MORE ARBITRARY, than other standards
for determining whether a poem is good, or great, or sublime, etc?

does any of this EAR TALK make you almost want to go so far
as to say "a poem should not only be, but also mean"?

and then do you feel you'll be misunderstood,and criticized,
because you'll seem as one who does not appreciate the crucial
importance of aesthetics in poetry, and even in written forms of
communication, when in reality you've nothing against the ear or music
but just feel there's a kind of privileged tyranny of these terms?

I think part of the charm of the MAG lies in what it represents. In a sense,
there is expansion, however, I think the last issue had fewer authors
represented than the issue before it.

To me it represents (and presents) a large number of authors in various
categories and geographic locations, all of which are good writers, and many
of whom are great writers. This stands as at least a testament to the fact
that at any point in history, there are many authors writing good work, not
just one or two. In one sense this can be disturbing - to see how much
decent work is being created right now (a bit destabilizing to the ego) -
but also wonderful, because it does show a more wide-ranging view of the
world of letters. In this way it is also inspiring.

I feel kind of opposite, Chris, in that where I am, to suggest that a poem
might not necessarily "contain" a message or have "something to say", or may
be "saying" in its shape and sound, creates all sorts of accusations of
obfuscation and wank.  So meaning (in the sense of being like Blair
ON-MESSAGE) seems a privileged tyranny to me.

Depends on one's context, I guess.

Interview with Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez
http://www.venezuelanalysis.com/articles.php?artno=1064

   >> excerpt:

M: Let's put this in a broader historical context, because it leads to
another question. In 1954, the US overthrew the elected President of
Guatemala, Jacobo Arbenz. In ’64, the US was apparently involved in the
events leading to the military coup against President Goulart of
Brazil. The following year the US marines invaded the Dominican
Republic, another intervention against a democratic government. The
Sandinistas were elected in ’84, and the US spent the next six years
destroying the country through warfare and sabotage, and even
intervened in the 1990 election.

H: You skipped Allende. [The U.S. was involved in the 1973
destabilization and overthrow of President Salvador Allende in Chile].

  M: Yes…

H: And Panama, and Grenada.

  M: Yes. The question is, the United States has gotten rid of most
Latin American presidents that it didn't like. Why do you think you
will be different?

H: You have to look at each of these cases of intervention
individually, in their historical context. Each case is unique. The
overthrow of Arbenz in 1954 was done through an invasion. But it did
not end there. It started a war that lasted for more than 40 years. The
Dominican Republic, Panama, Grenada—those were also invasions.

  Venezuela also has to be looked at within a certain historical
context. We have a strength that cannot be disregarded—a level of
consciousness and mobilization that did not exist in these other
countries. If you add up all the people who have participated in
demonstrations since 1999 [on our side], counting each person as many
times as they participated, the total is in the hundreds of millions.
There were more than 8 million people who came out the day of the coup.

  Also Venezuela has armed forces that are very solid, united, and
capable of counteracting any faction that could threaten democracy.

Really like this post and its questions, Chris!

One thought in response: Seems that in one way, at least, insistence on =
the value=20
of what is there for the ear, -- as well as placing materials to =
emphasize various words,=20
meanings, via sound and the scoring on the page of same
-- is part and parcel of a goal to decorate meaning, perhaps, as
as opposed to, say, exploring it.

In the same vein, when a Creeley, say, extols the virtues of =
foregrounding=20
the reader's deepening capacity to respond to or with the "senses"=20
(or maybe it was Zukofsky and maybe something more to=20
the effect of accentuating the sensory faculties or something=20
like that), then that, too, becomes a/the program -- quite apart from, =
say,=20
the infinite other things a writing, for example a poem or a poetry,=20
might mean, might mean to do, might participate
in the discovery of.

that runs alongside the west bank.  in front of a car.  i can show visitors

Lew Welch left Gary Snyder's home on the Yuba above Nevada City to wander to
his death in the Sierras (circa 1971). His prior work, The Song Mount
Tamalpais Sings, had already proposed being devoured by Turkey Buzzards as a
way to the next state of being. A beautiful poem by the way. Never found,
animals or foul undoubtedly completed the job.

A man who sang beautifully, but never "fit."

Lew' step-son, Huie (sp?) Lewis of H___ Lewis and the News took an optional
route. But they gone now, too, I believe.

But it is curious to see the ways in which a number of artistically talented
children of Beat writers took more institutionally stable, better paying
routes routes (i.e. The various Jones/ Baraka children).

But this diverges from Spalding who apparently decided there was no further
way "to fit."

This is a sad week. Two writers who I admired very much had the same black
idea.

Gombergs writing can be read at
www.planetfriendly.net/gomberg


Tooker Gomberg presumed dead

Canadian Press

Halifax — Tooker Gomberg — an environmental activist, failed Toronto
mayoral candidate and high-profile thorn in the side of Alberta Premier
Ralph Klein — was missing and presumed dead Friday.

Police said it appears Mr. Gomberg jumped off the middle of the Angus L.
Macdonald Bridge just after midnight in the early hours Thursday morning.

"We have a missing person report in relation to a 48-year-old man. We
normally don't identify individuals, so officially I can't say this is who
it is, but unofficially it is Mr. Gomberg," said Sgt. Don Spicer of the
Halifax Regional Police.

"All indications are he jumped off the bridge but we've not found a body
so we have to treat it as a missing person at this time."

Police found a helmet and bicycle on the bridge.

Rebecca O'Brien, a friend of Mr.Gomberg and his wife, Angela Bischoff,
said Mr.Gomberg suffered from depression on and off for the last three
years.

"It was depression that took his life. And his wife wants to refrain from
the details of how the depression took his life," said Ms. O'Brien.

She said Mr.Gomberg had moved to Halifax from the Toronto-area in
September when Ms. Bischoff was hired by a local group to improve the
bicycle transportation system.

Mr.Gomberg volunteered at the Ecology Action Centre but became more and
more despondent.

"He said he lost his chutzpah," Ms. O'Brien said.

When Ms. Bischoff, his partner of 17 years, returned from a social outing
Wednesday, she found a suicide note, Ms. O'Brien said.

Environmental groups in Halifax, Toronto, Montreal and Edmonton are
planning memorials for him.

Mr. Gomberg, an avid cyclist, founded one of Canada's first curbside
recycling programs in Montreal and headed Edmonton's EcoCity Society.

He was also elected to and served on Edmonton city council and cut a
colourful figure as executive director of the Edmonton Bicycle Commuters.

Mr.Gomberg became famous for his vociferous and unconventional sense of
political theatre.

Last spring, he was arrested at a rally protesting the war in Iraq when he
used a megaphone without a permit.

In 2002, he was dragged out by police from Toronto's tony Empire Club
after shouting down Mr. Klein during the premier's speech on why Alberta
doesn't like the Kyoto accord.

In that year's Ontario municipal election, he ran for mayor of Toronto —
and ended up as Mel Lastman's closest challenger, although the incumbent
won 80 per cent of the vote.

A few months later, he locked himself in a vault in Mr.Klein's Calgary
constituency office, saying the Klein government had failed to act on a
decade-old report on cutting greenhouse gas emissions.

In June 2000, Mr. Gomberg protested at the World Petroleum Congress in
Calgary and in March of that year he and other Greenpeace members chained
themselves to a 447-tonne piece of oilsands equipment being shipped to
Suncor Energy Ltd. in Fort McMurray, Alta.

That same year, he organized a group of protesters who threw pennies at
the head of Imperial Oil during the company's annual general meeting to
make the point it would cost only pennies per share to reduce greenhouse
gases.

In 1990, when Mr. Klein was Alberta's environment minister, Mr. Gomberg
led a group of placard-waving activists up on the stage at a hearing into
a northern Alberta pulp mill and accused Mr. Klein of betraying the
environment.

In Edmonton, a spokeswoman in Mr. Klein's office said he wished to extend
his sympathy to Mr. Gomberg's family.

"The premier always recognized that Tooker was a man who was extremely
dedicated to his environmental causes and had some colourful ways of
advocating for the issues he believed in," said Marisa Etmanski.

Mr. Gomberg's term on Edmonton city council was marked by his advocacy of
bicycling. He once aggravated his fellow councillors by chaining his bike
to Edmonton's new City Hall.

Edm Ald. Allan Bolstad, who served with Gomberg, said, "Tooker seemed so
indestructible.

"That's one of the things that makes it so difficult for me to accept what
I am hearing today."

Brian Mason, now a provincial legislature member, also served with Gomberg
on city council.

He called him a man of conviction who walked or pedalled his bike or rode
on public transit rather than drive a polluting vehicle.

He wore clothes of natural fibres, he recycled, he composted and he
gardened.

"I have never seen anyone who walked the talk like Tooker did," he said.
"He lived what he preached."

I suppose the regularity of the diatribes against Marx on this list continue
to cow some. Some not. Me, sometimes, too. "Moo." The regularity of the
diatribes against one of the most interesting thinkers of all time, Marx, hath an
effect indeed. A response! And so, also get me to stop looking down at my shoes
today all day long because of Rummy (in the white house), O-Reilly (on the
tube), and some homimens (on da' list), I'll start by saying (in the same simple
and plain language that trashes Marx): thumbs down on Christ. Trained meat,
Jesus (especially by now). And Luther, one of his more accomplished
lieutenants--thanks for the memories? Xtians. Lunatics! Better to share a pint with Judas
these days. See what's up with old Judas. Better yet, some cheery counsel I'd
prefer with Sparticus. Give me Sparticus. Or Lucretius--any day, over the
Nazarene.

Quoting Frederic Jameson, on Marxism, what "it" "is"--basically, what it
explores, from a myriad of different angles:

"The nature, dynamics, and polarizing logic of social class; the labor theory
of value; alienation and commodity reification; the hidden logic of
historical dynamics, most specifically in a relationship to social revolution, but also
in more static situations of domination or hegemony, national and
international; a commitment to the problem of ideology (but not necessarily to any
particular model of it), as well as to the problem of superstructures, in short, to
the whole problem of the 'determination of consciousness by social being';
finally, a sense of the great overall organizing concept of Marxism which is the
notion of the mode of production, a concept which ought to end by raising the
most urgent issues of the difference between capitalism and pre-capitalist
societies, of the originality or not of present-day consumer or late monopoly
capitalism as against the classical kind, and of course, last but most important,
the possible nature of socialism or communism as a social formation."

I can think of many books of poetry in the last two years, from (generally)
the (ooh) Big "M" perspective. I don't mention them here, as those authors can
well HUAC themselves. Platform, a book of mine (Atelos Press, 2003), can be
thought of as an engagement, or complex exploration of some the central themes
of marxist historicism, as it changes its skins, coats, expressions, and
perspectives.

"Lutheran Surrealism?" The Bauble meets the Babble?  Do tell.

In brief, I've found a richness in marxist analysis and perspectives. It
fills out what I'm reading in an expansive way (and what I'm reading doesn't have
to be "marxist"--for Lucretius' sake!...for the record)  And I'm constantly
surprised at how off the mark ("intention") my poetry goes hither and thither,
"forces out of my control"--a very Marxist thing.

And so, does M-izm answer the everything-of-everything--no "it" doesn't, can
(would) never--not even close. LIFE IS BIG. But M-izm also doesn't "say" that
the world is flat either. Or how many angels dance on the head of a
(manufactured) pin. Or that *anything* will (per say) return. So, on this return of
Surrealism--we wonder, why, or rather how is it in any way a thing 't'all'.


 -Rodrigo Toscano

ps. re: Jameson quote...note, 'determination of consciousness by social
being', not "determination of social being by consciousness"...sounds like a
chicken or the egg kinda thing...but lots of resistence to the big hairy ape M, is
that "by social being" thing.

Funny Kirby that on the one hand you complain about Chomsky conflating a
bunch of individual and different politicians to "Washington", and on the
other you talk about all "liberals" as if they were a singular phenomenon.
The idea that logic is a "white male phenomenon" is, for example, something
a lot of women (and not only women) have taken issue with over the years.
More so, I would hazard, than those who try to argue for some kind of
essentialist "woman's language".

This also sounds like a caricature to me, though it may have a truth in your
context.  But if it is so, it is a mirror of what you call "classical
grammar", where people were all already identified as well, and certain
types (female, black, semitic, mad, poor) were consequently dismissed as
invalid.  That is, the same mechanism, only with different validations. Not
sure that I think of that mechanism as ad hominen, though.

these bizarre factoids i'd never find elsewhere, like Stephen Vincent on
Huey Lewis being Lew Welch's step-son, and one a few months back posted by
Elen Gebreab, which, in passing, mentioned that Wanda Coleman won an emmy
award. When I googled it, I saw that Coleman had won for Days of Our Lives
and she was the first African-American to win an emmy award for daytime TV
writing.

The Atlanta Poets Group (taalntaopestgropu), Eyedrum Art & Music Gallery
(ydrmb), The Nameless (eyedrum's new imprint) and Perforations (_ _ _ _ _ _
_ _ _  _ _s) bring you UNREADABILITY, a Call for Work (yurdleayydhyihu)...

      U R N E D A B A L I I Y T

*
Many Calls for Unreadable ("poemy call")

what's the first thing that came to mind?
Hegel to Danielle Steel, Robert Frost to Khlebnikov.
how would you do both find/make/provoke poetry
      *and* _____ Unread.(rhymes with 'deed')
A doing against the grain with eyes and words.
Read the unread? Unread the read?
        is this negating? deforming?  transformative? political
(as our desires are marketed to and resolutely slip away)?
something-something-something i can't read?
the hole in every whole?
where the ink ran.
what *was* the first thing that came to mind?
readability but unreadability, inside out.
rust patterns resolve to letters. ever sent.
this candle is inadequate.
unreadability is unanswered here,
this is just the call after all just the call,
you send the work calling back, unreadably.


      N U E R A D A I B L I T Y

A question from the members of a Berkeley Zukofsky reading group:

Does anyone reading this have access to the original ms of Anew?  If so, is
the first line of the poem "Not it was no dream of coming death," as the
Hopkins edition of Zukofsky's Complete Short Poems reads, or is it "No it
was no dream of coming death," as the Norton edition (All...) reads?  Lyn,
Jean, Ruth, Colin & I assume it's the latter, but don't have any way to
confirm it.  We'd be thankful for any input.

Also if anyone out there has access to Zukofsky's map/graph of A-7 we'd be
grateful & moved to see a xerox or pdf, if possible.

SEGUE READING SERIES
AT THE BOWERY POETRY CLUB
Winter / Spring 2004

http://www.bowerypoetry.com/

308 BOWERY, JUST NORTH OF HOUSTON

SATURDAYS FROM 4 - 6 PM

$5 admission goes to support the readers

MARCH 13
BRIAN KIM STEFANS and MICHAEL GIZZI

Brian Kim Stefans' latest book is Fashionable Noise: On Digital Poetics. His
website is www.arras.net. He's recently taken up playwriting and will
premiere a short piece at Chashama in February.

Michael Gizzi moved to Providence last summer. His most recent book is My
Terza Rima (The Figures). He will read from his latest ms. Facing Life.

Raymond Hernandez {Bass Guitar and Vocals} has been the bass player for
Knight Riders since March of 2000. He has been involved in the world of live
music for 30 years. With God's help, at a very young age, he taught himself
to play guitar and sing. He has been a member of the choir at St. Andrew's
Catholic Church in Channelview, TX for 25 years and is very much involved in
several other church organizations. Before joining Knight Riders, he
operated the band Southern Justice for nearly 4 years. In November of 1999,
Raymond had a challenge slap him in the face when he severed the end of his
index finger with a circular saw. In less than a week, he managed to create
new ways to play his chords and fought through the pain so that he would not
miss a gig. Today, his finger is of no challenge to his performance. He
entertains any and every crowd no matter how small or large and still makes
it to church every Sunday.

(He won't be appearing at this reading.)

oops -- he did jump off a poem but it was "Le Pont Mirabeau" in Paris,
not le"Pont d'Avignon", which is a children's song.

i am very very proud of these. they took a great deal of my imaginary
to perform. i think i performed them well. for a human being there is
little to say that cannot be said in pictures. these are great pictures.

and they have a lot of thought in them about philosophy and metaphysics
and deconstruction and even the differend.

Columbus, OH(AP): Spaulding Gray found
in the next issue of Pavement Saw, but until then
here is an announcement for #8
released in 2004

PAVEMENT SAW 8: THE MAN PO
ALL MALE UNFINISHED AUTHOR INTERVIEW ISSUE


We thought the Whitey Issue or the Minty Fresh Pirate Issue could not be
bested but in 2002 they were. But how does one possibly top the Ultimate
Issue?

We were unsure but we were hoping with the help of one Anti-Laureate, a
Poet Laureate, and a bunch of masculine energy we might be able to
figure it out.

Because all journals should cantankerously define themselves, we will
hereby dedicate this issue as the UNFINISHED MALE AUTHOR INTERVIEW ISSUE
or in more familiar terms: THE MAN PO.

Besides what did we have to lose, tenure?

Is this another masculine concept with deep critical implications?


----------
An Excerpt of the Editor’s Note from The Greatest Literary Journal in
the World

Howdy.

Unlike most of our recent issues which have had some form of an
introduction holding the issue together, here we cannot begin to form
any sort of cogency. For the past number of months we have been sitting
around, mail has arrived, the economy has gone into a slump, thefts were
committed, the mail load further increased due to aforementioned
societal downturn, there was an increase in poems which violated the
interns, the rejections turned nasty, and of all of this the most
unfortunate occurrence was that no nameable theme surfaced. And how
could we surpass the magnificence of our previous journal? With a name
like the Ultimate Issue we were doomed. Our sleeping schedules changed,
there were full brown outs during direct sunlight, we were getting
depressed & tried everything—getting jobs, swimming in mall fountains,
fung shui,  listening to Devo, taking each other’s medication. Even when
our primary college, as reported recently in the New York Times, voted
to use the term “evolution”  rather than “changes over time” in science
courses, a real advancement for our city, for which we salute the brave
and avant guard decision of Ohio State University, it did not temper our
folly.

The post-Ultimate depression was upon us. In another attempt to lift our
spirits, I created a subscription form for the Ultimate Issue (#7)
worded in an ambiguous way. As a result, I have netted and kept signed
confessions from over 80 writers admitting they are Poor Poets. Some of
these writers have always stunk. These gave us many brief tee-hees, but
our only hope is that by fully admitting our worthiness for inclusion
into the Cannon we will further display our center of attention deficit
disorder and extricate ourselves from moroseness.

As the morose host, I have congealed a finery of chicanery for the
issue.
---
[ this area shows how to write negative reviews, supplies examples &
encourages the process, some samples below]

“The next time a mood strikes to read Italian Sonnets by a Turkish
refugee, this is a must read!”
“The spirit of overcoming others can hardly be overlooked in the poem
‘Trousers.’”

---
We hope you will find solace and inspiration to write negative reviews;
all we ask for is a copy of the published essay.

-----

Another scandal, brought to my attention, and into my home, this summer
by an east coast poet, which shows as nearly as lame an area in need of
serious poetic attention, are exercises in poem writing manuals
distributed to creative writing classes. Normally I am far removed from
viewing such suspect devices, but recently a skid of mostly unopened
textbooks containing the offending material was hidden at my house for a
few days by a well known MFA program-teaching poet working on doubling
his income.

------

We propose including other inventive techniques in these writing guides
so we can continue to have a staff, and to stop the proliferation of
this infectious nonsense. I call these exercises Poetry Infliction
Inhibitors.

[various exercises originally here, the one below is my favorite--DB]

4.) Write a poem based on fear. Wear a dark sweatshirt with a hood large
enough to cover your entire face when worn. This is called a “hoody.”
Wear it with ground dragging jeans and expensive sneakers. Walk around
neighborhoods such as Mount Vernon and 20th in Columbus. For more daring
poems try walking the South Bronx nowhere near the Throgs Neck Bridge or
Diamond and 34th in Philly. Record your experience in line breaks that
reflect the use of breath you experience. As a variant, call yourself
Uncle Sammy and wear a star spangled hoody in Arabic countries.

-------

Maybe, someday, if we meet, we can teach you the Secret Pavement Saw
Handshake.

Until then, Be well

David Baratier, Editor, Pavement Saw Press
-------------

SAMPLE QUESTIONS

DB: Looking at the shelf of books you wrote I am wondering: why did you
write so many? Was it intentional? Vindictive?

DB: Why is the Ronald Mc Donald House a good place to meet women?

DB: What is a School of Continuation? Do you meet in secret locations on
the lower mountain side? Can I join?

DB: In one of the earlier drafts of _Poet be like God: Jack Spicer and
the San Francisco Renaissance_  not only is Jess Collins portrayed as
the evil anti-poet, usually referred to in the text only by his first
name like Satan or Osama or Prince, but surprisingly, you are also
treated in a similar manner. Since I am about to be roasted by a book
that is as yet unpublished, and you appeared as a wonderful two named
entity in the published Wesleyan edition, do you have any advice or
techniques to share?


DB: Back to religion and returning to the idea of a poem being
pneumatic, rather than of breath, or to breathe in the way Olson
suggested for the line, the poem works as a translocutor, and I would
think pneumatolysis might be closer in kind. As if the poem is a
doctrine, an intermediary of spirits between God and man, intended to
inspire a movement from one condition to another. Care to comment?

oops -- he did jump off a poem but it was "Le Pont Mirabeau" in Paris, =
not
le"Pont d'Avignon", which is a children's song.

if i were to launch a poetic inquiry, i would ask, how does death figure
into your work? what is your poems' proximity to death? if a poem is a
surivival, an excess of life, how and what does it that survive? not a =
self,
surely...(?) what is it that you hope will survive? or do you write for =
the
sound of it? and if for the sound, for the sound of what?

for a catalogue of literary suicides I'd recommend David Markson's 1996
novel Reader's Block.

I'd recommend it anyway as it is fantastic!

I actually read it at the same time as I read Mathew's 20 Lines a Day
while I was trying to finish my MPhil.

Reader's Block is a great book!

later,
kevin

I second Reader's Block.  I just finished it yesterday.  I couldn't put it

The lovely Reader's Block begins a sort of trilogy
with "This is Not a Novel" and the just released
"Vanishing Point."

Completely breath-taking novels made up of single

A Prolegomena to the Third Manifesto of Any Lutheran Surrealism Whatsoever

Lutheran surrealism is today a mere phrase -- tomorrow it will be a way of life.

How can this idiotic phrase leave the people of today quite cold, and yet tomorrow inspire
millions towards a lunatic stability, a revolutionary passivity?

Modernism believed in progress as Stalinists killed millions that were in the way of their
bright ideas, and Hitlerians destroyed millions who didn't embody their Aryan ideal, and
surrealists got mad at each other because they didn't smoke the same brand of cigarettes.
With Lutheran surrealism we invoke a different tradition altogether -- that in which everyone
is accepted, no one is truly looked up to, and we indulge in the scurrilous scribbling of
poetry without any hope of bettering either ourselves or helping our neighbors.

We do not believe in yesterday, today or tomorrow, while realizing that only a mental patient
can believe in eternity.  We believe in all reasonableness that the conception of the New
Jerusalem (we never permit ourselves to joke about a Nude Jerusalem) offers the critical
dimension -- one that is not of our making but which stands beside us in such a manner that
we have almost as much hope of ever seeing it as we have of seeing our own ears without the
aid of a mirror.

Although we can never truly glimpse Lutheran surrealism we can see it in others -- like a
doctor looking into an elderly gerbil's eyes we can see the sorrow of an eventual awakening
in humanity -- an awakening like that of the gerbil who refuses any further to run upon her
wheel, or to hope that with effort will come a new tomorrow.

Lutheran surrealism denounces the Protestant work ethic as a fascinating fraud, and yet
accepts that hard work is often less effort than lounging before a TV.  We denounce the
spirit of capitalism and yet accept that it's better to have too much money than none.  We
denounce books, the arts, and yet we indulge in them and hope to win many prizes.

Lutheran surrealism is in fact not so much an invention as it is the discovery of a way of
life that already exists or is in process of unfolding in the universal spirit.  It is the
discovery of a paradoxically cynical feeling that history is an error, and that time is a
waste, but that inside of time is an indescribable essence felt by all living creatures --
from the ant's antennae tapping a crumb to the lobster waltzing sideways on the ocean floor--
that something ordinary hides a reality show so tragic and so comic, so obvious & yet so
hidden -- that all of our efforts amount to nothing beside it.  We recognize that we cannot
hurry it and cannot seduce it, but that it is coming to awaken us into a new spirit as old as
the first atom.

Lutheran surrealism is thus not well understood.  It requires better staffing.  Presently the
movement of a greying middle-aged man (even his family shows no interest!) it will
nevertheless cow Marxists (it already has!) and open the hearts of disciples from the most
unexpected quarters and become a world-wide phenomenon at least as important as sleeping.

hi y'all...

you might want to fwd this, or some version of this so that people come to
yr night at zinc...

In 1980, the typical CEO made 30 times the average employee's salary.  Now
that same CEO makes 331 times the average worker.  Someone doing your job
in 1974 would have gotten 20% more money for it than you are in 2004 --
that means you have to work an extra two months a year to make the same
wage.*

In the face of systemic erosion, the Zinc Talk Reading Series has
maintained the same high standard of cultural equity since its inception
nearly ten years ago.  Those who come Sunday nights might be a little tired
halfway through their double shift on Monday, but they never regret it.
That's because, in the economy of the spirit, thrift is ruinous.

Please helps us march onward into springtime with these four events at

Zinc Talk Reading Series

March 7: Andrea Baker & Kevin Varrone
March 14: Brenda Coultas & Kim Lyons
March 21: Mark Salerno & Macgregor Card
March 28: Jim Behrle & Jen Benka

at Zinc Bar 90 West Houston Street NYC

economic climate, a great emptiness in your wallet.

so I hope you are there to glance at.

Court Orders Halt to SF Same-Sex Marriages
)

Associated Press
(AP) - The California Supreme Court ordered an immediate halt to gay
marriages in San Francisco and said Thursday it would hear a case in May
or June on the legality of such marriages.
The action by California's highest court came two weeks after state
Attorney General Bill Lockyer and a conservative group asked the seven
justices to immediately block the gay marriages, with more than 3,700
couples having wed at City Hall so far.
The dispute began Feb. 12, when San Francisco Mayor Gavin Newsom ordered
his administration to issue same-sex marriage licenses. A steady stream of
gay and lesbians from two dozen states have traveled to be married at City
Hall, just a block from where the Supreme Court sits.
California's top court did not immediately address whether Newsom had the
legal power to authorize the marriages, which contravenes a state law and
voter referendum that say marriage is a union between a man and a woman.
The justices also did not address whether the California Constitution
would permit a gay marriage, as Newsom claims.
Instead, the justices moved to block any more marriages, at least for now,
until they decide whether Newsom had the power to authorize such unions.
Had the court declined to intervene, the legal battle over gay marriage in
California would have taken years as gay marriage lawsuits traveled
through the state's lower courts.

Mass. legislators ok gay marriage amendment

The Associated Press

March 11, 2004, 5:56 PM EST

Boston -- Massachusetts lawmakers gave preliminary approval Thursday to a
constitutional amendment that would ban gay marriage but allow civil
unions.

The amendment, which would strip gay couples of their court-granted
marriage rights, must still weather several additional votes and
anticipated legislative maneuvering by opponents.

The earliest a ban could end up on a statewide ballot is November 2006,
more than two years after same-sex couples can start getting married in
Massachusetts

$10 would buy a one year Wegway subscription and enter you in Wegway's
First Annual International Juried Photography Exhibition
Steam Whistle Gallery, May, 2004, as part of Toronto's Contact Photography Festival
Wegway – Primary Culture P.O. Box 157, Station A, Toronto, Canada M5W 1B2 www.wegway.com

Entering the exhibition includes a one year Wegway subscription,
so one of these things is free.

Wegway’s First Annual International Juried Photography Exhibition will take place at the Steam Whistle Gallery attached to the Steam Whistle Brewing Company in the old roundhouse in downtown Toronto. This event is officially part of the Contact 2004 Toronto Photography Festival www.contactphoto.com. The work exhibited may also be published in the Fall 2004 issue of Wegway magazine and each artist will be given space to publish a statement about themselves including contact information if they so wish.

There will be three jurors selecting your work:

Becky Singleton, a multi-media artist with work in the permanent collection of the Art Gallery of Ontario.

Matt Wyatt, Director, Steam Whistle Gallery.

Steve Armstrong, a visual artist and the Editor/Publisher of Wegway Magazine.

Participation in this show has many benefits:

1 Contact is a major international photography festival. The Wegway show will be included in their catalogue.

2 Your work published in Wegway Magazine will be distributed across North America.

3 Acceptance by a respected jury is a valuable addition to your résumé – it will encourage other arts professionals to consider your work.

4 The staff at Steam Whistle will have time during the show to become familiar with your work, and thus have it in mind for future exhibition opportunities.

5 The opening reception will be an excellent time for networking in the art community.

6 Your work will also be posted on the Wegway website www.wegway.com including a cross-link to your website or an email contact if you wish.

Steam Whistle will make every effort to sell your work, but you are free to decide whether it is for sale or not. There is no commission on sales. Wegway does not receive any monies from this show except the $10 application fee that helps us keep on publishing. And don't forget the free magazine subscription included when you apply. I hope you participate in this show and I look forward to meeting you at the opening reception.

While chatting (in English) with a Cuban friend I used the phrase "no flies
on me." A blank stare. My friend is very fluent in US English, butr had
never heard the phrase before. In Spanish it would be something like "estoy
sin moscas" or "sobre yo no tienen moscas," which would convey very little.

I was wondering if anyone knew the origin. It sounds to me to be black
english, maybe from a play or film.

I await enlightenment, and a lot of horsing around (oops, those flies again).

Dear Mark,
The phrase is very common in Ireland.  I'm pretty sure it is a transliterat=
ion of the Irish "Phlaghas," meaning a tax imposed on illiterate parents =
of Irish children attending school under the Penal Code (illiterate =
parents were obliged to pay the Phlaghas, thus discouraging educational =
advancement among the poor, particularly in rural areas).  People would =
say: "Nil phlaghas ar bith orm," meaning "There's no fear of me having to =
pay the Phlaghas," the implication being that one was literate.  "Flies" =
is an Anglization of "Phlaghas" (the two words sound exactly the same =
despite the difference in spelling.  I guess the saying came to mean: "I'm =
no fool" in the 20th century.

I was a member of the Heaven's Gate cult in a former life.

Now really, a mass suicide by all members of poetics could make interesting
news.

Who's the Jim Jones of the group?

i don't know if this was vaudeville, mistrel-show stuff or something
real, but from when i was a kid i seem to recall hearing a line like:
"ain't no flies on jesus."

Well, the expression is in Brewer's, though it doesn't "sound black" there:

        There are no flies on him.
        --He's very shrewd and wide awake; he won't be caught napping.

Mark, go to Google - it's a quick, endless, boring search, but it's in a
lyric - like in the summer time where you rub honey and vinegar into your
skin, and wow, unlike all those other folks at the picnic, "no flies on me."

Another way of saying "I'm clean" whether I did it - some petty crime (a
successful spit ball) -  or not.

so here you go a baseball poem from the Southside of Chicago

35th and Shields

picturesque ecstasies of religious faith; bitterest misfortunes;
hounds hunt a disease oa accidents, for the prevailing rate of wages, a man
hunt
for a lousy foreighner led by righteous protestant blondes. Slice off my
skin with an infected butcher knife
blood poisoned; beaten to death, tracked by bloodhounds torn to pieces, open
sewers, crack of the bat
my mushy stomach

black is better

weakened by starvation, cold and exposure, sickness accident-gnaw out your
heart bodies and soul wife an babies all is
efficient suburban breeding opens doors to creation, the new master race

I hate blue

All on the List:

This chain of events pending,
I believe this is no joke:
Take it outside and have a smoke,
You're life will be shortly ending.

I wish I was Tennyson.
That's all that matters now:
it's a bitch to be Keats (and how!)
Yr gonna be marinated like venison.

Be wary, Mary. Hold fast, Clive.
A mass suicide is pending,
It's not like I'm through sending
you a loaded Mexican beehive.



Send me $50 American
or be wiped away by Bloomy Cropsy's Comet.

This is no joke.
Send me money and be depleted, repented.

Furthest I could trace it was to the following:

'Most all the time the whole year round, there ain't no flies on me,
Eugene Field, "Jest 'Fore Christmas" (published 1904, but pre-1895, when he
died)

which sounds like the phrase predates the poem. It's been used in a lot of
songs since then.

Mairead,

This is a beautiful explanation, is that really so? I am wondering how=20
Lutheran Surrealism fit into that? You have to pay taxes if your parents are=
=20
illiterate.

Completely off the topic, I saw three movies recently: "Lord of the Ring,"=20
"The Battle of Algiers" and "The Fog of War" (the last a few hours ago); all=
=20
three are basically about war.

There was quite an extensive discussion of the first movie on this list,=20
focusing essentially on its being racist, if I remember. I do not quite see=20=
it,=20
though the villains look like lepers, when the movie is not ripping off "Sta=
r=20
Wars." Watching the Oscars I learnt most of the creators of the movie, the=20
director, the music composer and the special effect people, etc. were all fr=
om New=20
Zealand (that was the running -although feeble- joke during the ceremonies),=
=20
in addition to the movie being supposedly shot there. Considering that the=20
Maoris constitute a significant part of the New Zealand population, their to=
tal=20
visual absence in the movie -even if only as location shot details- is amazi=
ng.=20
More than racism, the cause seems to me economic. It shows how modern big=20
money financing drains almost everything of local color. The movie has an ee=
rie=20
unreality to it partly because even the open air long shots are not location=
=20
shots. New Zealand is a place of cheap labor. The directors are cheaper, the=
=20
musicians are cheaper, the cleaners of toilets are cheaper -in a "big" proje=
ct=20
like this this is essential.

More than anything, "The Ring" reminds me of Masterpiece Theater, the genre=20
in which the English class system (upstairs and downstairs) is confused with=
=20
culture. The highest virtue in the world of "The Ring" is loyalty and devoti=
on=20
to one's master. The most loyal hobbitt (hobbitts always recognizable by the=
ir=20
big feet, as opposed to the lords with normal feet) ends up in a place like=20
Switzerland (not New Zealand) at the end of the movie. More about the nausea=
ting=20
last ten minutes of the movie a bit later.

The biggest way the hobbitt expresses his loyalty is by resisting, refusing=20
to take the ring, embodying power and ambition, from his master's neck.=20
Considering the deep increasing economic divisions developingin our country,=
 that's a=20
convenient ethos to push forward.

"The Ring" ends in an artificial, overgreen set of Swirzerland where our goo=
d=20
hobbitt marries the buxom, curly haired milkmaid (undoubtedly with big feet)=
,=20
has children and they live in a miniature wooden, bright colored chalet. Eve=
n=20
"realistic" pictures of Swiss countryside are utopian cliches. Why does the=20
movie creates a set in flaming, aggressively "artificial" colors? I think=20
because unreality is of the essence of this movie. The New Zealand visually=20=
may be=20
considered the Switserland of the Far East. But that kind of identitificatio=
n=20
is not what the film is looking for.

People discuseed the parallels between The Seconf World War and the war=20
scenes in the movie. I did not see it that at all> Most battle scenes were w=
eak=20
imitations of earlier movies.

One scene had escaped for me these limitations and had a touching=20
authenticity, the Charge of the Light Brigade, when the demented king of the=
 sends his=20
loyal but unloved son to fate the Huns on horseback. That did happen in the=20
Crimean War in 19th century.

It id 4:A.M. I need to talk about the other two movies later.

Just got word from Shizumi that Cid passed on at about 6 o'clock this
evening, March 12th, Japan time.  Cid had been on complete life support
since his by-pass operation and had lingered on in a semi-conscious state.
Now he's at one with his words and his long goodbye is over.  Jesse

this is a civil rights issue.

I have watched in horror as state-after-state has voted to add
constitutional amendments take rights away from queers. I have read and
heard hate speech coming from the president to local officials,
cloaked in religious dogma, justifying their acts of discrimination and
hate. I have heard the great compromise in Massachusetts of creating a
two tiered system. know this; NO MATTER WHAT - SEPARATE BUT EQUAL IS
NOT EQUAL...

  this is a civil rights issue. and if these actions where based on the
color of one's skin, country of origin, or one's spiritual practice,
there would be outrage, but I have not seen outrage. what I have
witness is inaction and a continuation of day-to-day commerce, life
going on.

I have seen and acted, as these crooked deeds of this president turn
into a  list too long and heinous to even begin to imagine; acts that
has cost many life's, wiped away liberties, and steadily taking steps
that will destroy the earth we live on. I have seen this imperialist
patriarchal regime kidnapped world leaders, lie to the world, imprison
individuals without trial, cut back on HIV treatment (big time here in
San Francisco - a coincidence?), put forth ideas like gender
segregation, and reduced education to a joke based on testing - and
still it seems as if we go about our days, buying goods and exchanging
pleasantries

when I hear this unelected dictator speak words like: "we can be
confident in the ways of Providence. ..., there's a dedication and
purpose, set by the hand of a just and faithful God."  -"The course of
this conflict is not known, yet its outcome is certain. Freedom and
fear, justice and cruelty have always been at war, and we know that God
is not neutral between them." The union of a man and woman is the most
enduring human institution." and ``You're doing God's work with
conviction and kindness,''

and when I see this fake president allowing religious charities a
greater hand in delivering social services, all the while cutting back
existing support systems

and I hear a president speak on limiting the power of activist judges
that interpret the law, and legislate from the bench; judges that put
bush in office, the kind of  judges that stopped the ban of interracial
marriage, judges that struck down the sodomy laws, and  judges that
acted on Roe vs. Wade

when I see overt discrimination bills being passed, hate speech bandied
about  and hate crimes on the rise; and when I see life go on, lost in
the security of the job, abandoned humanity to the time clock,  and
everyone just existing in a system that puts forth dogma and promotes;
greed, discrimination and hate... I can no longer stand by,  as my
brothers and sisters, are murdered, lose there jobs, and are placed in
a separate but equal system.

it is time to stop business as normal - shut it down. every act must be
a revolutionary act, every act must be an act of resistances to this
regime. we must be bold in the face of a police state and fear of
discrimination and loss of employment. we must be nomadic, and step
forth before it's to late...

we need to stand up and chant the chant I heard last night at the state
building, listening to a sweet gay couple who was denied the right to
get married...

WE'RE QUEER - WE'RE HERE - WE'RE MARRIED - GET OVER IT!!

ACT NOW.. every act counts-.. support lambda legal defense fight in
almost every state to defend queers that are being discriminated
against.. take a stand today... live life as a revolution!!!

it's time amerika to wake-up.

Thanks Jesse.  This is indeed sad; does Shizumi have any means of
supporting herself?  As i recall, the list periodically issued
financial SOSes on their behalf.  I saw Cid at Naropa in ... 1995?
He read us some amazing Viet Nam War poetry/prose by an unknown
person --US man --and had such passion for discovering new work and
hooking people up with each other.  He even saw his ice cream store
in that vein --a place people could come in and meet. Very touching.

program chair; experienced and exacting faculty editors; and through
interaction with each other, invited guest speakers, and with artists from

Deb:

When I die, can I count on you to read my work?

I only met Cid Corman once, in Kyoto, 1968. The Olympics was on the tea
house's TV, and he was more interested in watching than talking to another
visiting American poet. The man had good taste.

Mairead is right to the Celtic - the phrase in this country has early white
trash - read "indentured" - origins.  Way of saying, "They can't call me
trash on this one" (when the owners come around accusin' things.) Course the
phrase - say post W War II -  gets gentrified - "new country" - as a
financial marker.

Somewhere, down inside - I speculate all great poets are variously covered
with flies. That sleezy feeling that provokes and kicks out great poems.

In a novel by Charles Willeford titled The Burnt Orange Heresy, there are a lot
of discussions of painting because the lead hero is a corrupt art critic.  On
pp. 67-69 there is a fascinating discussion of the symbolism of flies in
medieval painting --

"In medieval painting, and well into the Renaissance, a fly was painted on Jesus
Christ's crucified body: the fly on Jesus' body was a symbol of redemption,
because a fly represented sin and Jesus was without sin.  A fly painted on the
person of a layman, however, signified sin without redemption, or translated
into "This person is going to Hell!"  Ray Vint painted a trompe l'oeil fly on
every portrait" (69-70).

The art history department of most good universities would have a specialist in
this area that could probably flesh this symbol out?

Mark, you had a query a few months back about "Oh, man," and "Oh, boy," and the
differences, and I just wanted to put in that in Finnish, for whatever reason
(maybe Anselm could explain this), the people say in very similar circumstances,
"Voi, nena!"  (There are umlauts over the a.)  It means, "Oh, nose!"

songs since then.

It does indeed. The earliest entry in the OED (1848) is from Australia:

[H. W. Haygarth Recoll. Bush Life Austral. ix. 101] **'It's lucky we got
them,' said Amos; 'there were "no flies" about that black bull. ' Note. This
expression is very common in Australia...**

The OED suggests the origin is US or Australian and glosses its entry thus:
'The earliest examples indicate that the phrase was prob. orig. applied to
cattle that are so active that flies do not settle on them.'

But I like Mairéad's supposition.

Subject: Jack Spicer/Philip Dick query

Lori, please post this for me. I sent it to you before but it got lost in
the shuffle. It was rejected again from poetics. I've tried test messages
to 5 of 9 other lists that I am on and all of them work fine. Have gone
thru my mail preferences and such as well and cannot find any attachment
crap, nor do any of my immediate friends get my emails with attachments
they say. not sure what else to do. John


**
Perhaps someone on this list knows (Kevin Killian, are you still on this
list?)

In POET BE LIKE GOD [Ellingham and Killian] some thematic connections are
discussed between Philip K. Dick and Spicer. This passage;

...when Larry brought Jack a copy of Dick''s novel _Counter Clockwise
World_, Spicer said bashfully, "I know Phil Dick!"  Dick's novel begins
with a scene right out of Spicer's later poetry--a man approaches a hot dog
vender in Aquatic Park and receives a slip of paper that reads "HOT DOG."
There was a strange confluence in the work of the two writers, since
Spicer's theories of dictation, of the "outside," resemble Dick's later
vision of VALIS to a remarkable degree. VALIS. Dick's acronym for the "Vast
Active Living Intelligence System" that permeates our universe without
mercy, only unintelligible revelation, is as scary as anything in Spicer.
(The "Pacific Nation" itself is anticipated in the references to the "PSA"
[Pacific States of America] in Dick's 1962 novel _The Man in the High
Castle_.) _______Page 301

***

I have some questions about this passage.

Philip Dick's novel is actually titled _Counter-Clock World_ and doesn't
open with a man buying a hot dog. But  the hot dog & the slip of paper
sound like something from a Dick novel or story, less so perhaps, for me at
least, than Spicer's poetry. Where in Philip Dick does the hot dog note
story come from?  Any guesses?

Has anyone written more extensively about this comparison?  It would seem
to me that Spicer's dictation would compare more to Dick's visions.
Spicer's various poetic figures of outsiderness (martians, ghosts, etc) are
stagings of this experience, much as in Dick's later novels we see his
visions and such reframed in novels, the visions attributed to satellites,
aliens etc.

***

Also, I have been intrigued by the comparisons made by Peter Gizzi in his
afterword to THE HOUSE THAT JACK BUILT where he quotes from "It Came from
Outerspace" and "Invasion of the Body Snatchers" and references "Invaders
from Mars".  I'm trying to work out a few film nights locally, on the 1st
I'll show "Invasion of the Body Snatchers" and then Cocteau's "Orphee" at
the 2nd I'm not sure, I would like to pair them again in a similar
popular/artsy way but also tie them to Spicerian themes. Suggestions
welcome for other popular films that figure a fear of difference/paranoia
that Spicer could have seen and/or art films which play well next to tropes
of dictation, orphic myth, etc.

thanks
John

Ok, Rodrigo, now I have about ten minutes to respond to your support of Marxism.     I think
you said that you are from Mexico, and therefore are probably familiar with Octavio Paz.
Have you read his essays on Solzhenitsyn?  There are two essays.  He remarks in them that in
his defense of Solzhenitsyn he was going against Mexican avant-garde culture generally, but
that he felt that he had to do it.  He does not take up Solzhenitsyn's Christianity, but he
does say that what Mexico missed out on was the Protestant Reformation.  Somewhere else he
talks about this terrible thing called the mordida, in which you have a pyramid scheme and
each person pays a higher up a small tax of sorts for their help.  He says this is
responsible for Mexico's mess.

I don't want to get into the Protestant work ethic, and why it functions, and how quickly it
would wipe out the mordida, but I just want to try one more idea on you.  Or maybe two.

1.  What went wrong with Marx was that he read Feuerbach.  Feuerbach said that God was an
alienation of man's best qualities (he leaves out the devil), and says, according to an
introduction to philosophy textbook that I use by Donald Palmer called Looking at Philosophy,

"Man is God, but we can only become the god that we are by an act of self-recovery that can
be brought about exclusively by annulling our traditional concept of religion."

However, Marx then denies Feurbach and says that the changing of material reality will change
our spiritual reality.

"Marx argued that all change must begin at the level of material configurations."

2.  This brings up the foundation/superstructure bogey that Marx brings up.  In it, he seems
to argue that ALL ART is determined by legal and political arrangements (ideology). This
would imply that a countervalent art is not possible, or that a revolutionary art isn't
possible, and that even if we think it is, this is false consciousness.  How can you then
have a true consciousness unless it's through poetry?

But, if revolutionary poetry isn't possible, and we are only mimics of the social order, why
does this list of revolutionary poets exist?  I think it's because in fact this list is
actually inspired by dada and surrealism.  I actually think that even Bernstein and Silliman
and many others owe their larger debt to surrealism than to Marxism.  Silliman's blog almost
never lists Marxist artists.  He is much more interested in writers like Brautigan (quite
surrealist) and going back a few months -- Proust -- who was a close friend of the
surrealists at their inception (he knew Soupault's mom in high school, and he gave Breton
quite a bit of help at the beginning).  The leaps in the work of so-called Language poets,
their jumps and hops, are not owed to the social realism that came out of Marxism.  It is so,
that even you, Rodrigo, are closer to Octavio Paz than to Stalin, Lenin, or any of the other
Marxists who use artists to try to recreate social reality.

And Breton was very inspired not by Marx or Marxists (he came to despise them) but by
Lutheran philosophers such as Hegel (who put spirit over matter) and by many German Romantics
who were steeped in Lutheranism.  Therefore, the hop skip and jump into Lutheran surrealism
is hardly even a movement.  It's just a realization that we are really all Lutheran
surrealists without knowing it. Poets are not about material reality, they are all about
spiritual, or at least mental reality.  There is no way you can get rich or change the
material culture with poetry.  You can alter the mental or spiritual culture, however.

Jameson and his ilk have everything reversed.  I think most poets would agree with Hegel's
great joke in the Phenomenology -- where he says that anybody who believes in phrenology
deserves a bump on the head.  That is, material reality doesn't influence the spirit.  The
spirit determines material reality.

Maybe it's chicken or egg, or maybe it's just a yolk, but Lutheran surrealism -- as it was
almost understood by Paz and Breton, has now been well and truly laid before you, as the
goose that will give us all the golden eggs of the future.  What Hamlet (also a Lutheran!)
was to Shakespeare, the omelette of Lutheran surrealism is to the present.

Best,

Kirby Olson

geez kirby:

"At the very centre of Marxism is an extraordinary emphasis on human
creativity and self-creation.  Extraordinary because most of the
systems with which it contends stress the derivation of most human
activity from an external cause:  from God, from an abstracted Nature
or human nature, from permanent instinctual systems, or from an
animal inheritance.  The notion of self-creation, extended to civil
society and to language by pre-Marxist thinkers, was radically
extended by Marxism to the basic work processes and thence to a
deeply (creatively) altered physical world and a self-created
humanity.

"The notion of creativity, decisively extended to art and thought by
Renaissance thinkers, should then, indeed, have a specific affinity
with Marxism.  In fact, throughout the development of Marxism, this
has been a radically difficult area, which we have been trying to
clarify.  It is not only that some important variants of Marxism have
moved in opposite directions, reducing creative practice to
representation, reflection, or ideology.  It is also that Marxism in
general has continued to share, in an abstract way, an
undifferentiated and in that form metaphysical celebration of
creativity, even alongside these practical reductions.  It has thus
never finally succeeded in making creativity specific, in the full
social and historical material process."

Raymond Williams, ~Marxism and Literature~ (1977), p. 206

assuming you aren't familiar with williams's work here, i'd have a
good long look, esp. if you're interested more in how marxism has
developed (note williams's "development of marxism"), and less in the
unreconstructed version(s)... after all, the above was written more
than a quarter-century ago... i've always felt that this little book
by williams is among the most valuable such critical texts around...

best,

In the first issue of _The Difficulties_ (1980), I published these two poems
by Cid Corman:

1/  It's hard to say anything
    and nothing's impossible.
    Which leaves me hanging here...I

    think it's better to stop now

My ten minutes here, just to say that in the face of such blatant
mispresentations of history, it's almost impossible to have an argument=2E=
=20

Breton not influenced by Marxism? The same Breton who expressed to Trotsky=

his wish that Surrealism become the French wing of the Left Opposition?

Reducing the problem with Marx to a third-hand version of the tired base
and superstructure problematic? This is the same Marx after all who writes=
,
"Men [sic] make their own history, but not under conditions of their own
choosing=2E" Which is already, in such sound-bite form, a far more nuanced=

concept of "determination" than the crude smear that Marxism tout court
erases volition from its account of human action=2E (Joe's posting of the
text from Williams goes some distance to pointing up how eminently
"developable" such a notion is)=2E

The constant attempt to align Stalin and the atrocities of "actually
existing socialism" with Marxist thought and practice as a whole? Tell you=

what, you take a breather next time you want to write bureaucratic
Menshevism into Capital, and I'll hold off on blaming J=2EC=2E for the
Crusades, or Luther for the Thirty Years' War=2E

Some further reading: Since you bring up the engagement with Feuerbach as =
a
decisive one (tho' this is arguable, being in many ways an underdeveloped
and youthful text -- like deciding one's reaction to WC Williams based on =
a
report from someone who knew someone who once read "The Wanderer", for
example), I thought it might be helpful to have a bit of the "These on
Feuerbach" themselves, rather than the hearsay synopsis":

2
The question whether objective truth can be attributed to human thinking i=
s
not a question of theory but is a practical question=2E Man must prove the=

truth, i=2Ee=2E, the reality and power, the this-sidedness [Diesseitigkeit=
] of
his thinking, in practice=2E The dispute over the reality or non-reality o=
f
thinking which is isolated from practice is a purely scholastic question=2E=


3
The materialist doctrine that men are products of circumstances and
upbringing, and that, therefore, changed men are products of changed
circumstances and changed upbringing, forgets that it is men who change
circumstances and that the educator must himself be educated=2E Hence this=

doctrine is bound to divide society into two parts, one of which is
superior to society=2E The coincidence of the changing of circumstances an=
d
of human activity or self-change [Selbstver=E4nderung] can be conceived an=
d
rationally understood only as revolutionary practice=2E

4
Feuerbach starts off from the fact of religious self-estrangement
[Selbstentfremdung], of the duplication of the world into a religious,
imaginary world, and a secular [weltliche] one=2E His work consists in
resolving the religious world into its secular basis=2E He overlooks the f=
act
that after completing this work, the chief thing still remains to be done=2E=

For the fact that the secular basis lifts off from itself and establishes
itself in the clouds as an independent realm can only be explained by the
inner strife and intrinsic contradictoriness of this secular basis=2E The
latter must itself be understood in its contradiction and then, by the
removal of the contradiction, revolutionised=2E Thus, for instance, once t=
he
earthly family is discovered to be the secret of the holy family, the
former must itself be annihilated [vernichtet] theoretically and
practically=2E

(And on it goes=2E By the way, if you're interested in chewing on the actu=
al
texts [not always in the most recent translations, but still=2E=2E=2E], yo=
u can
find them at www=2Emarxists=2Eorg)

OK, I've probably HUAC'ed myself enough for the moment (thanks for that
formulation, Rodrigo) -- though the idea that a passing acquaintance with
early Hegelian Marxism constitutes some sort of political (and poetic)
liability these days, in this forum, is profoundly distressing=2E

Poetry Project to hold Silent Auction on April 17

Dear friends, readers, collectors and thrill-seekers,

The Poetry Project will be holding a silent auction as a spring fundraiser
on Saturday, April 17 from 3-7pm. This event will include performances,
refreshments, a book table, and other assorted random entities. The Auction
will take place in both the Sanctuary and Parish Hall at St. Mark's Church,
and if the weather cooperates we'll open the back garden.  It is essentiall=
y
a kind of spring party, which will also serve a fundraiser for The Poetry
Project to help us get our programming in gear for the 2004-05 season.

We want this to be a community-wide event. There will be both affordable an=
d
high-end rare books, broadsides, magazines, prints, paintings, drawings,
collaborations, collages and other ephemera available (a backstage pass to =
a
show of Saturday Night Live might be coming down the tube) -- and there wil=
l
be a casual environment at the event itself.

We will gradually, over the course of the next five or six weeks, list the
many art and literary items we'll be offering at the auction on our
Announcements Page: http://www.poetryproject.com/announcements.html. Prices
will not be listed at this point, but we're talking about an approximate
range of $3-$2500.=20

More info will come in the days ahead, but look forward to items from/by:

Duncan Hannah, Alice Notley, Emilie Clark, Alex Katz, Kiki Smith, George
Schneeman, Clark Coolidge, Ted Berrigan, Paul Auster, Lou Reed, Bernadette
Mayer, Paul Valery, Jasper Johns, Patti Smith, Yvonne Jacquette, Jim
Carroll, Anne Sexton, Jack Spicer, Aram Saroyan, and more...!

We can=B9t wait to see you, and to bring in the Spring with what should be a
fun party AND a productive fundraiser.

Cheers,

2.  This brings up the foundation/superstructure bogey that Marx brings
up.  In it, he seems to argue that ALL ART is determined by legal and
political arrangements (ideology). This would imply that a countervalent
art is not possible, or that a revolutionary art isn't possible, and that
even if we think it is, this is false consciousness.

Marx never said or implied this. You might want to read more Marx. - Alan

That sounds like _Time Out of Joint_ (1959), except that
it's a soft-drink stand which disappears, leaving behind
a slip of paper that reads "SOFT-DRINK STAND."

kirby, i keep thinking about what must be bugging you in order for
you to go after marx as you are... surely the posts by taylor and
others must have persuaded you that you're reading him far too, what,
narrowly?...

if your point is that english studies *as a profession*---which incl.
its scholarship, among so many other things---has in its orientation
to more materialist discourse given spiritual thinking short-shrift,
i would agree with you (uhm, i think)... i wouldn't read "spiritual"
as religious---which you seem to be doing... i tried to talk about
this some years ago in a woeful presentation i was invited to give,
or a presentation i was invited to give that turned out to be woeful,
in which i argued that cultural studies and poetry, as discursive
practices, had slipped and slid over materialist AND spiritual(-ist?)
issues... it seemed to me that one could locate certain kinds of
scholarly discursive realms where, e.g., it was ok to talk about the
erotic surplus of *joy*... whereas in most academic contexts, to talk
of such things would be deemed a mystification... and in poetry, on
the other hand, the resistance to the thought of someone like marx,
or better, raymond williams, certainly among more conventional
writers---such resistance seemed self-evident...

still, i would be loath to try to place *either* the material or the
spiritual (the secular spiritual, in my case) one above the other...
so you seem to be vying for the wrong sort of critical attention,
from where i'm sitting... why not clarify your agenda a bit for us
before you charge in head first?... and if you could do so w/o such a
relentless desire to shove thought into tidy little categories, that
would help lots too...

thanks for listening---

best,

joe

I had to laugh when Kirby wrote that Hegel was a "Lutheran" philosopher,
since I had no idea that Absolute Knowledge was a churchly idea (seems to
be more about the withering away of said institution, but I don't
particular want to engage), but it made recall that Kirby has said he
seemed to get into fights in Finnish bars.  Well, perhaps this article
suggests why.  In any case, I have no idea whether the Finns are as
reserved as this suggests.  I do have a friend who is second generation,
but she is one of the nicest people I know, but not reserved (and also a
publicist for Soft Skull press).

HELSINKI JOURNAL
A Word to Finns: 'For Your Own Good, Blow Your Top'
By LIZETTE ALVAREZ

Published: March 11, 2004


HELSINKI, Finland  Turo Herala is the first to admit that his mission to
teach Finns how to get angry and make a scene, or even to feel joy and
happiness is, in all likelihood, bound for failure.

Three months ago, Mr. Herala, a theater director with a yen for therapy,
took it upon himself to bring "anger venting" classes to Helsinki on the
theory that his famously silent and stoic compatriots were about to
combust from repressed emotion.

Finland, while infinitely livable and likable, suffers from some of the
world's highest rates of suicide, depression and alcoholism. "How to
control and express anger safely," read his classified advertisement in a
local newspaper.

He has had few takers. An organization that handles domestic violence
called to enlist, as did a smattering of individuals. But it was so odd a
notion  tutorials in how to get angry  that Mr. Herala made headlines in
the largest daily newspaper here.

"Yes, it has been difficult to get people to sign up," he said over a
glass of white wine at a local bar, pleased nonetheless at all the
attention. "Anger in Finland is a bigger taboo than sex."

Psychologists and academics here said they were not surprised that Mr.
Herala's advertisement would attract attention as a novelty, and then go
largely ignored.

"Self-control is very important in Finland," said Dr. Liisa
Keltikangas-Jarvinen, a professor of psychology at the University of
Helsinki. "You cannot show anger; it means you can't cope. If a person is
very temperamental and alive, expresses emotions like anger and happiness,
the person is seen as infantile."

Even among Nordic peoples, the Finns' stolid nature stands apart.

Ben Furman, a psychiatrist who until recently was the host of a popular,
but very serious, television talk show here, was pilloried last year for
suggesting that the government should stop paying for psychotherapy
sessions. As he prepared to defend himself in interviews, over and over
again, Mr. Furman said the one piece of advice he consistently got was
"don't get angry, no matter how much you are provoked."

"People would assume I was guilty if I got angry," said Mr. Furman,
co-director of the Brief Therapy Institute here. "I had to rehearse and
behave in a way where no emotion was shown. A normal person would react
emotionally to these charges. If I was in Italy, I believe I would receive
the opposite advice. You must be guilty because you are not reacting
emotionally enough."

Here, experts say, a car accident brings, not blame and insults, but a
polite exchange of information. A bus breakdown causes no complaints;
rather, the Finns on the bus will file off and try to push it to the next
stop. It is no coincidence that 80 percent of women who give birth here
refuse pain-killing epidurals, according to one study. In America, 90
percent of women ask for them.

But Dr. Keltikangas-Jarvinen said suppressing anger in Finland was only
one piece of the country's entrenched cultural code.

Here, it is not unusual to walk into a restaurant and spot most people
eating dinner in silence, content to chew and not chatter. Silence is a
sign of wisdom and good manners, not boredom and half-wittedness.

Some would say this taciturnity has served Finland well, particularly
during the cold war, when the Soviet Union was literally a short tank roll
away. "For 30 to 40 years there," Dr. Keltikangas-Jarvinen said, "it was
politically very wise to be silent."

Finns also cringe over compliments. They don't dole them out and they
don't take them in. As part of a group therapy exercise, Dr. Furman asked
the participants to name one thing they each could do well, he recounted.
No reply. Then, he asked the people in the group to give someone else a
compliment. They couldn't.

Stumped, he broke them up into groups and asked them to say one nice thing
about someone outside the circle. Finally, they did. "We needed to back up
a couple of steps, to teach people how to talk positively about one
another," he said.

Ingrained with modesty, Finns are almost physically unable to boast or
show off. In an era of unattenuated hype, they cannot self-promote. "It is
considered a sin," Dr. Furman said, with a laugh.

Dr. Keltikangas-Jarvinen said she receives American rsums, and sometimes
cannot help but view them suspiciously. To her, they throb with hyperbole.
"I feel shame when I read these `excellent' portfolios,' " she said.

The flip side of this modesty, Dr. Keltikangas-Jarvinen and others say, is
that Finns, despite their many advances, particularly in the technological
field, seem to suffer from a self-esteem crisis. Theirs is such a
consensus-driven, homogenous culture that a free exchange of ideas
sometimes proves difficult.

"I mean, the president has something like a 90 percent approval rating
please," Dr. Furman said. "For our country to keep up with
competitiveness, we need to respond differently."

Mr. Herala, the "anger teacher," said much would be solved if people could
just learn to say what they think and express their emotions, be it "I am
angry because,"or "I love you because," he said.

"We are," he said, "the Finnish version of the Japanese character."

Allison--I see your point, especially about context. In different contexts
I've made similar---and even identical--arguments as you're making here.
But I guess I'm more curious how you--or anyone--would respond to the other
questions I asked, which to me remain less addressed and in many ways
more crucial.

It's not so much whether "meaning" (as "normative discourse")
is privileged in the abstract or "shape and sound" are (both can be equally
about style and seduction, and the issue of where the "line of demarcation"
is an earnest jest?).

But to ask what ends any argument of poetics, or the "value" of any poem,
may serve?
So if someone implicitly, or even explicitly (though that's rarer in the
poetry context I "know"), criticizes or dismisses a poem of mine on the
grounds that it doesn't fit their particular preferences in "shape and
sound" I personally am less interested in adjusting the way I write to fit
what may seem to be their predilections. On the other hand, I might be
more willing to adjust to "speaking their language," in the sense of
understanding their terminology, lexicon, in the hope of carrying on
a conversation---

for instance, I just got a rejection letter which criticized the work I sent
for not being "passionate" enough---
and I respect that a) because the editor had the guts to be honest
and b) because it can spur me on to send more work in which I might be
considered more "passionate" by this person's standards. Sure, at the same
time I could argue, "my work is passionate" to this person, or that
"what you call passion is a normative bourgeois value, etc."
or I may just forget this particular editor, grant it no authority
as a temporary tyrant-muse. Next time I'm writing and it occurs to me
that what I'm writing is more like poetry, I may remember, "oh yeah, this
might fit in with what this editor wants" (actually, this particular
editor also accepts prose) and send to this person.

This is my own particular context right now, but yeah there have been times
when "shape and sound" have mattered more to me, and I'm sure there's been
times I've been published more on the grounds of "shape and sound" than on
"meaning"--to be starkly binary about it. And there's other writers who
some might like more for "shape and sound" who I like more for "meaning",
etc. etc.

But the question about "normative"---about what's "normative" in the world
"at large" and what's "normative" in poetry (or in various sub sub sub
specializations of poetry)---well, I'm now more impatient with the notion
of "signature style" that seems to grant many writers more authority in
"writing communities". A feeling of (not necessarily me) being "held back"
by it...

And say norms of style, whether old-school iambs, or something more like
Olson's particular notion of "breath" (maybe even it's the way HE breathes--
which is fine for him)--when written up in (un iambic, or un-breath-unit)
PROSE, and then established as a standard for others (often implicitly)--
and having THAT as a kind of basis for a "community"--seems sick to me,
like longhairs getting beaten by cops in the 60s or by punks in the late
70s--

I'm curious what you think about that....

But one needn't even go so as to claim we shouldn't value EAR or MUSIC
or "shape and sound" to at least question that these terms are used in ways
that privilege certain notions of "shape and sound" (sometimes in poetry
"circles", whether "avant" or mainstream") it feels like the awardsters,
publishers, editors, etc., are like, say, stravinsky heads and the coltrane
heads uniting against a common enemy saying, "The sex
pistols aren't music" (or perhaps even vice versa)---but wouldn't it
be better to say "it is music, it just doesn't move me"?
Or does that undermine their precious CULTURAL AUTHORITY?
That, to me, may be the bigger question

and though I sometimes thinkfeel the tyranny of "normative discourse" is a
reflection of a normative dominant social order, I find that sometimes
proponents of a normative social order actually speakwrite in
"non-normative" ways and sometimes opponents of this social order writespeak
in ways that could be considered normative....

Lo!


We raise the stained book of the dead
for all to see its pages
Wrested from Charon's bone hands;
the first time here - in ages!

See how poets fill the slats
between the blood-ruled margins -
Stalin signed for some of them
and made their deaths a bargain -

We know their names - now let us join
the ranks of these dead poets
Remembered well, our names will be
in schoolbooks, like the prophets!


Cleanse your sins, but not with wine.

Send money and secure your shrine!


-- Lord Brenton

Boojum Carter


feline, aged 13 1/2, four years after our mother's death, biopsy diagnosed
as follows:

Microscopic: MAMMARY MASS ONE - This mass is demarcated and has a well
localized appearance. It is comprised of a collection of neoplastic
epithelial cells that are forming tubules. The tubules are separated by
variably thick connective tissue septa. The neoplastic cells have ovoid
stippled nuclei and a scant amount of eosinophilic cytoplasm. Cytoplasmic
borders are distinct. The mitotic rate is low and ranges from 0-1 per
high-power field. Nonneoplastic tissue is forming margins. There are
scattered aggregates of lymphocytes and plasma cells surrounding the
growth MAMMARY MASS TWO - This is the larger of the growths evaluated.
There are several large cysts. There is a proliferating population of
neoplastic epithelial cells. The cells are organized in the lobules that
are forming occasional tubules. The central areas of the lobules are
degenerate. Neoplastic cells exhibit invasion. One or two layers of cells
line the tubules. The cells have large round vesicular nuclei with
multiple nucleoli. The cytoplasm is eosinophilic, scant and cytoplasmic
borders are distinct. The mitotic rate ranges up to six per high-power
field. Nonneoplastic tissue is forming margins.

DIAGNOSIS: MAMMARY MASS ONE- MAMMARY GLAD ADENOCARCINOMA, TUBULAR, LOW
GRADE MAMMARY MASS TWO - MAMMARY GLAND ADENOCARCINOMA, TUBULAR CYSTIC

PROGNOSIS: Guarded

COMMENTS: Feline mammary malignancies should be considered capable of
metastasis and warrant a guarded prognosis at best. The first smaller
growth evaluated is well localized and is not exhibiting invasion. This
appears to be a well-differentiated adenocarcinoma. The second growth is
exhibiting invasion and this growth should be considered as having
potential for metastasis. Lymphatic invasion is not identified with any of
the sections evaluated. These growths appear to be excised.

Comments by doctor: Guarded. Felines tend not to recover. She might live
six months, several years, or less. There is no way to tell. She needs
immune system fortification. The doctor wishes her news would have been
better. The question is whether or not the tubules remain within the body.
The cancer could spread rapidly or even go into remission.

Comments by writer: Boojum is named after the Boojum tree in Baja
California. She is thirteen and a half. She exhibits no signs of illness.
She has been my companion and is highly sociable and nervous, She has the
personality, if not the skills, of a brilliant writer. At the moment she
is sleeping, recovering from the removal of her stitches. She travelled
with us to Miami, where she encountered, even indoors, new and interesting
forms of flora and fauna. Azure and I pray that she will live forever.

Comments: That cancer is always the same, disordered, disorderly, a tough
go whose treatment is violent and invasive as well. The well-defined
structure of the body begins to collapse as tunnels are formed through
highly-organized tissue.

Every organism is a world of miracles, and every creature dissolves in the
fury of cancer and creation. Azure and I are beside ourselves, and Boojum
Carter dreams now, not of death.

Cid had made it back to the States one more time: to Wisconsin for the
Niedecker Centenary last October.  He talked essential Niedecker from
beginning to end-- in his winsome, convinced manner-- and gave a great
reading at the very end of the conference.  It was a long prose poem
addressed directly to the audience, in the we are here now mode.

Just before opening this email, I was perusing a copy of the October 14,
2003 Daily Jefferson County Union (newspaper) that Peter Whalen (of Woodland
Pattern) had kindly sent me, with photos of conference participants milling
about Niedecker's cottage on Blackhawk Island, peeking in the windows of the
cabin or contemplating the Rock River.

At the top of the page is a photo of Corman, with Shizumi looking on,
signing a book.  The caption reads: "Cid Corman, of Japan, literary executor
of the Lorine Niedecker estate, left, and his wife, right, discuss Niedecker
with Marilla Fuge, a local Niedecker scholar."  (Fuge I believe is a
Fort-Atkinson old-timer working on Niedecker's geneaology.)

Cid had plans to restart Origin as an online 'zine.  I knew him long enough
to receive one of his blue typed aerogrammes, in response to a copy of
_ecopoetics_ I'd sent:  "Yr pieced on Lorine ok.  Thank you.  Better --
however -- to let her work tell itself."

"I remain . . . the most productive poet ever.  Nearly 200 books published
and hardly any notice of any -- though I've made a point of NOT getting
publicity and so have lived a strange life (always in poverty, unlike my
friend Allen Ginsberg).  No complaint.  1000s of unplublished poems piled up
around me here: all publishable, even those I discard."

His motto (scribbled on the outside of the envelope):

"Life is poetry
& poetry is life -- O --
awaken -- children!"

Engaged to the last.  Where would American poetry be without Cid Corman?

Yes, on-going financial difficulties are very real for Shizumi.  If folks
would check the archives of this list, bank account information is
available for anyone who might want to contribute.  Cid died without
leaving a will or information regarding other important issues.  He kept
track of the money, but no bank books have been found as of this date.  The
sad fact is, Cid and Shizumi existed on next to nothing for years.  All of
those SOS messages were real.  Cid used to wear taped-together glasses and
shoes with holes in them when he went out.

Had Cid chosen the academic route he would probably be a retired professor
living on a good pension with great health benefits, passable teeth,  and
another five years to look forward to, but he chose an entirely different
path and really paid the price for it.  He got up every morning and worked
on his writing until twelve.  I could always count on that, and usually
gave him a call in the afternoon.  "How's it going, Cid?"  "Oh hi, Jesse.
Not too bad.  No complaints here."  And then we'd talk about William Carlos
Williams, Olsen, John Dewey, Bronk, Prynne (whom he actually introduced to
Olsen) or any number of subjects.  He knew them all and the proof is now in
his work room in the hundreds of letters and documents that are stacked
there in helter skelter fashion.

Tomorrow is Cid's funeral and I'll be catching the first bullet train to
get to Kyoto on time.  I couldn't make it to tonight's wake.  Cid is having
a Buddhist funeral, but I can't help feeling that Cid should have the
benefit of his traditional faith, even though he was a Jewish agnostic. If
anyone could say a few prayers for Cid's soul, I'm sure he'd appreciate it.
 We'll all be reading some of his poems tomorrow in a tribute--and of
course, Cid's poems could also be prayers for Cid--maybe the best kind.

Cid and I had some conversations about God and such and I came back to that
subject when I had my last conversation with him.  Cid was being kept alive
by machines and it was hard to know what exactly he was thinking--or even
if he was thinking.  I told him I hoped that he was going to a place free
of pain and full of meaning.  That maybe that was the secret behind it
all--meaning with a capital M.

Cid could be brutally honest with people.  He also seemed sometimes to be
interested in gathering disciples more than friends. He was
cold--particularly when it came to publishing his work.  Cid, to my
knowledge, never said too many thank yous--as if you were doing the world a
favor when you pubished something of his.  He suffered, I think, from being
the smartest kid on the block for fifty years, at least in his part of
Japan, and in that isolation he came to believe that his work was greater
than Dante's and the Bible--a "fact" which he proclaimed on more than one
occasion to startled visitors.

He also appeared to keep Shizumi in the dark--and to my mind unfairly--
about too many things.  (A note to those folks who would like to write
Cid's biography in future, I want to say right now that without Shizumi's
dogged efforts, Cid would have been totally lost in his later years.
Shizumi went to work every day to support Cid while he sat home to create
the poems which were--in the main--published for copies--or next to nothing
in hundreds of little magazines and chapbooks.  It was Shizumi who fed them
both.)

Reading Cid when he was just a phone call away, and reading Cid now that
he's truly in, of, and about the text is really a different experience.
The so many of the words have picked up an oracular resonance, when before,
so much of what he wrote--esp. the last stuff--seemed a bit self-evident
and even a tad silly. I just wanted to say sometimes to Cid--"Come of it,
man!" But I suppose the same could have been said of Ryokan or any number
of real poets who turned out to be much much more than the sum of their
parts.

As I was saying to Chuck Sandy, (who, with his family, is doing a wonderful
job of helping Shizumi and putting Cid to rest, even as I write this)--Cid
was Cid.  He was a larger than life character--generous, wise, wonderful,
vain, arrogant, even perhaps a little foolish--but a real genius, I think.
You'll not see his like too often.  Jesse

Playnt

I'm selfish and I'm tired. When I die I'll sleep an eternal
sleep. I'll have no choice but to sleep and sleep and sleep. I'm
selfish, I keep waiting for my due, for my books to appear, for
Marjorie Perloff to pat me on the shoulder, for a MacArthur
grant, for Katherine Hayles to realize I have something to say,
for something that might get me out of debt. I help everyone I
can, and there are so many people who don't like me, precisely
because of this, my incessant posting, my whining, my obvious
depressions, my aggressions, my acerbic nature. At the last few
conferences, I've been in troubles, sometimes I think I'm
invited only out of guilt by someone or other. All I can fall
back on is my work, and what does that amount to, if I'm in
everyone's kill file, if I'm not in bookstores or Kim's video or
Target? I keep putting out trash-work, hoping someone will see
the value in it. I think I should disguise this playnt by coding
and recoding cleverly - as if my own works had any significance
in the first place. In any case, as soon as I'm dead it will all
disappear. Look at the fury of the world around us. We keep
placing ourselves out 'there' for no reason at all. Even
rebellion is stillborn, the enemy has literally billions to push
its way through our hearts and minds. So my own quibbles mean
nothing in this regard. But I want to present my work in a clean
and proper way, I still want, at 61, to teach a class in media,
in experimental work, I still want, at 61, to receive my first
grant for my work since 1976, to see my book on a bookshelf in a
nice store with someone looking through the pages; I still want,
at 61, before I can no longer think, to find my soundwork at
Kim's Video or Target or Borders, my images in a wonderfully
prepared and printed book, my audience not one I have to force
myself onto; at 61, I'm so so tired, bone-tired, death-tired,
fear-tired, sick-tired, of self-justification, self-explanation,
self-critique, self-theory, ugly and useless self-promotion, as
if this narcissistic hole-in-the-wall is all there is

I just wanted to mention a truly fantastic website I've just
discovered - the kind of thing that restores my faith in this medium.

The site is http://www.omniglot.com and it contains a comprehensive list of
the world's various writing systems. Each has its own page, which
gives a good potted history of the writing system in question, tells
you what languages it is used to write, shows the complete alphabet
(with the names and phonetic equivalents of the glyphs), has a sample
text with transliteration and translation, provides links to places
one can download free fonts for that script system as well as links
to resources on the languages it is used for.

If, like me, you're fascinated by the character palette in Panther -
with all the fantastic writing systems that Apple now bundle with the
system - this is a brilliant complement. I had no idea what
'Deseret' might be, for instance - I'd never heard of this curious
alphabet which Apple obligingly provides. Turns out it was invented
by the Mormons...

What's more, the site seems to have been created by just one person.


James

has a virtue that might be overlooked: the print on the page implies a
powerful vocal delivery, it seems to me, for example

like the sonar of the dolphin and the sonar of the blowing
like the piece of the end of the bird and the piece of the end of the
dolphin/
like the wings of the butterfly and the bird
like hummingbird of the suction and the suction of the butterfly
like the language of the human being and the hummingbird of the language

The book is subtle in many ways, and deserves a detailed review, and
surely one should appear in Jonathan Skinner's ECOPOETICS, given Spahr's
explicitly distancing herself from most "nature" poetry and turning toward
ethnobotany, among other concerns (Dasein/Sein?)

The title is:

The Justice Department wants to significantly expand the government's
ability to monitor online traffic, proposing that providers of high-speed
Internet service should be forced to grant easier access for FBI wiretaps
and other electronic surveillance, according to documents and government
officials.

A petition filed this week with the Federal Communications Commission also
suggests that consumers should be required to foot the bill.

Law enforcement agencies have been increasingly concerned that fast-growing
telephone service over the Internet could be a way for terrorists and
criminals to evade surveillance. But the petition also moves beyond Internet
telephony, leading several technology experts and privacy advocates
yesterday to warn that many types of online communication, including instant
messages and visits to Web sites, could be covered.

The proposal by the Justice Department, the FBI and the Drug Enforcement
Administration could require extensive retooling of existing broadband
networks and could impose significant costs, the experts said. Privacy
advocates also argue that there are not enough safeguards to prevent the
government from intercepting data from innocent users.

Justice Department lawyers argue in a 75-page FCC petition that Internet
broadband and online telephone providers should be treated the same as
traditional telephone companies, which are required by law to provide access
for wiretaps and other monitoring of voice communications. The law
enforcement agencies complain that many providers do not comply with
existing wiretap rules and that rapidly changing technology is limiting the
government's ability to track terrorists and other threats.

They are asking the FCC to curtail its usual review process to rapidly
implement the proposed changes. The FBI views the petition as narrowly
crafted and aimed only at making sure that terrorist and criminal suspects
are not able to evade monitoring because of the type of telephone
communications they use, according to a federal law enforcement official who
spoke on the condition of anonymity.

"Lawfully-authorized electronic surveillance is an invaluable and necessary
tool for federal, state and local law enforcement in their fight against
criminals, terrorists, and spies," the petition said, adding that "the
importance and the urgency of this task cannot be overstated" because
"electronic surveillance is being compromised today."

But privacy and technology experts said the proposal is overly broad and
raises serious privacy and business concerns. James X. Dempsey, executive
director of the Center for Democracy & Technology, a public interest group,
said the FBI is attempting to dictate how the Internet should be engineered
to permit whatever level of surveillance law enforcement deems necessary.

"The breadth of what they are asking for is a little breathtaking," Dempsey
said. "The question is, how deeply should the government be able to control
the design of the Internet? . . . If you want to bring the economy to a
halt, put the FBI in charge of deploying new Internet and communications
services."

The Western reference may prove fruitful since obviously Spicer was
interested in the genre.

Alan, he says it --

This is from Marx's A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy --
the preface, where he lays out one of two or three paragraphs that I thought
were central axioms of his thought.  This passage is a direct contradiction
of Hegel -- if you've read the Phenomenology, as you probably have, you will
see it.  Hegel is a Lutheran -- he says as much over and over in his writings
-- the German anarchists were all over Hegel for this.  Marx was also raised
as a Lutheran.  This is why he's always citing Luther.

But here's where Marx says it -- I think this is like one of the two top
paragraphs in all of Marx --

"In the social production of their life, men enter into definite relations
that are indispensable and INDEPENDENT OF THEIR WILL, relations of production
which correspond to a definite stage of development of their material
productive forces.  The sum total of these relations of production
constitutes the economic structure of society, the REAL foundation, on which
rises a legal and political superstructure and to which correspond definite
FORMS OF SOCIAL CONSCIOUSNESS.  THE MODE OF PRODUCTION OF MATERIAL LIFE
CONDITIONS THE SOCIAL, POLITICAL, AND INTELLECTUAL LIFE PROCESS in general.
[And this is where he contradicts Hegel:]  It is not the consciousness of men
that determines their social being, but, on the contrary, their social being
that determines their consciousness."

Here is a link to the whole preface

http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1859/critique-pol-economy/preface.html

He does get caught up in a paradox just after this passage where he says that
we can become conscious of our social being (presumably with him as a kind of
psychoanalyst helping us through our repression.  This would indicate that
yes, the ideational superstructure CAN INFLUENCE the foundation (or what good
would his writings be??), but he always seems to imply that the material
foundation is almost totally dominant.

Like Plato, he may have offered room to the philosopher-king (soi-meme), but
nothing to the poet.  Try to find one single sentence in which the poet has a
role in the creation of the Marxist society anywhere in Marx.  I looked for a
good long time.  The criminal has a role (in the "fourth" volume of Capital
on Surplus Value -- there is a fascinating passage on the criminal as
producer of wealth).

In existing Marxist societies the poets were often first into the trash bin.
In Pol Pot's Cambodia, all literate people were killed.  The role of literary
people (especially the literate outside of the reigning party elite) has been
to shut the hell up and illustrate the philosopher-king's ideas or die in
every existing Marxist society.   You find the same thing in Plato's
Republic.

I am simply objecting to this on the part of poets, and wondering why poets
have been zombified by a guy who seemingly had next to no need for poets, and
who was himself one of the worst poets imaginable.

Joe -- I've read some of Raymond Williams -- I don't know how much -- but
not a lot.  A hundred pages or so, and watched a videotape.  He's
interesting, but I think even here you see what a tough game he's playing
-- he's trying to wrestle Marx away from Marxism, isn't he?  Why bother?

The problems with Marxism are so enormous -- you could list fifty
countries off the top of your head that have been shitholes for most of
the 20th century thanks to Marxism -- and I could ask you -- um, do we
want this?  How can you fix it so that it works?  This is why I
originally asked what part of Marxism continues to inspire you?

Not Raymond Williams, mind you, but Marx himself.  Williams it seems is
moving in a direction that Marx himself had not set out, and this is why
he's having such trouble with it.

Why shouldn't we look to Locke, to Luther, for different models of
society (after all, their models have produced America, and the
Scandinavian states), and in terms of poetry -- what have Marxist poets
(I think this is a contradiction in terms, but I'm not avese to those)
produced?  Even those few that do exist -- such as Neruda -- could
arguably be said to have been more influenced by surrealism.  Breton and
Trotsky did write a few pieces together when Breton was in Mexico shortly
before the pick axe incident, but those pieces on art are not like
anything else that Trotsky ever wrote, while they are very much like
other writings of Breton's.  Breton had the upper hand at the moment, and
Trotsky (who had no problem slaughtering people as he did during the
Potemkin uprising) had to dance to his superior's tune at this juncture
in history.

The poets only role among Marxists is to illustrate the guiding principle
of the party.  If he or she goes outside of that, he is put in prison or
killed.  Same as in Plato.

Now Raymond Williams, it seems to me -- is SAYING EXACTLY what I'm saying
in the paragraph below, but he's asking -- MUST THIS BE SO?  Look through
Gus Hoffman's critical writings (he was a Finn).

Thanks for trying to deal with me.  I am the only person I know in all of
academia who wants off this train.  You asked my agenda -- or somebody
did -- it's to question what happened to the avant-garde artists in early
20th century who tried to help create Marxist states.  What was their
reward?  Lutheran surrealism will offer a much more pampered situation
for artists and poets.  Luther's best friend was Albrecht Durer.
Breton's best friends include many of the most important painters of the
20th century.  Did Williams have great poets and painters among his close
personal friends?  Did Marx? I think that our sources of inspiration are
inadequate, and even wrong.  Luther and Breton are the way.

Yes, it says "conditions," but not determines. If you've read Marx's (or
Engels') lit crit, you'd see that clearly.

Most people react positively to the early notebooks; I do as well. As far
as Pol Pot, you can't blame Marx on that, any more than you can blame the
so-called founding fathers here (or Voltaire for that matter) for Bush.

Marx's work on surplus value, exchange value, alienation, use value,
mediation, is important as you know - out of it developed the cultural
work of Adorno, Horkheimer, Benjamin, etc., all of which is still relevant
and brilliant. I know of no better work than Benjamin's Arcade Project for
an account of the activities and interactivities of culture and capital,
and it's a fun read as well.

Kirby,

Well, you finally get around to citing something, and it actually
contradicts the point you were trying to make in some fairly important
ways. First, to your contention that for Marx "ALL ART is determined by
legal and political arrangements (ideology)" -- in this passage it's
pretty clear that law and politics are themselves superstructural, not
foundational. But the deeper problem is with the continuing (more than
a century and a half, and counting) willful misreading of the place of
"determination",  "correspondence" , and "conditioning" in this passage
by readers who approach it from the standpoint of their prior received
conviction that Marx is a crude determinist.

As Alan points out, the crucial verb in the passage is "conditions,"
not "determines." That is, political, ideological, and legal
superstructures are "conditioned" to "correspond" to relations of
production. There's a whole lot of wiggle room in those verbs, and most
subsequent Marxist thought (Marx's own as well as others'), is
concerned to develop their possible nuances. You can see some of this,
for example, in v3 of Capital's critical account of the hereditary
landed estates and their relation to agricultural production. Here the
laws of value set a limit to -- that is, "condition" -- the
realizability of rent in landed property. At the same time, within the
scope of this situation, title in land (a legal, not a productive
relationship) exerts a considerable reciprocal influence on the rate of
profit and consequent attractiveness to capital investment of
agriculture. It's true that in the end, the productive forces win out
when, in this case, the growing productivity of agriculture (which
historically lags behind industry) forces down the average rate of
profit to the point where it runs up against monopoly in land as a
limit, and the legal and political fields are increasingly pressured to
adjust and provide for greater alienability and fungibility of land.
(This is pretty well borne out by the historical record, by the way).
But nowhere is this a direct relation of "causative determination"
between "base" and "superstructure" -- in fact, the laws governing
property "correspond" to the productive relations in agriculture, for
the period in question, in the mode of a specific contradiction, not an
unmediated reflection.

Where "determination" does come up in the passage you cite, it's pretty
clear, as you indicate, that this is intended to be a pithy inversion
of Hegel. And so I think it would behoove us to look into Hegel at this
point for at least a preliminary sense of what Marx might mean by
"determination," which is almost never, in that tradition of German
philosophy, meant to stand for causation plain and simple.
Determination is more often a providing-of-ground-for, or again, as
with "conditioning," above, a setting of the limits that allow a
concept (in Hegel) or a social relation (in Marx) to become active as
such. (A setting of terms, literally. Oddly, Olson comes to mind here:
limits are what we're inside of (which is probably not the exact
phrase, I think the grammar is a bit funkier, but Maximus is out on
loan to a friend)). Given this somewhat more nuanced sense of
determination, the paradox you point out in the later passage, in which
consciousness is activated to change social being, simply disappears.
The paramount point, developed over and over in Marx and throughout
most of the Marxist tradition, is that consciousness encounters a world
that poses definite limits to its activity (that's the "independent of
their will" you've emphasized), and then sets about -- ON THE TERRAIN
OF THAT GIVEN WORLD -- to remove or transform the limits. This is
actually one of the more expansive accounts of human creativity going
(cf. C.L.R. James, who develops it along the lines of a preference for
"creativity" to "productivity"), and I would think poets and artists
would find it of interest.

That Marx doesn't develop his own specific model of poetic cultural
production doesn't bother me so much. The guy only lived so long. Less
flippantly, within the so-called western Marxist tradition, the
articulation of such a theory has been a productive concern for the
better part of a century now. (Cf. Alan's nod to Adorno and Benjamin,
also Lukacs, Jameson, etc.) There are other gaps in Marx's own texts
that have functioned similarly -- for example, see David Harvey's
attempts to theorize a geographical dimension in Marxist thought, where
Marx's own texts, aside from the suggestive final chapter of Capital v1
and a lot of political journalism on British colonialism, have left
this dimension largely unarticulated. And it may well prove that in
some of those "gaps," an adequate theory can't be constructed within
the terms of "Marxism." It's not a unified theory of everything, and,
as Rodrigo helpfully points out (quoting Michael Stipe?), "Life is
big." Protestant theology, by the same token, isn't a very successful
means to negotiate theories of biological evolution, but for the great
majority of self-identified American Protestants, that hasn't
necessitated jettisoning their faith all at once. And it hasn't stopped
them from attending to the biological sciences -- though there's always
Kansas as a counterexample. Similarly, your insistence that a theory
unconcerned in its first iteration with poetry is of no use to poets
seems profoundly limiting to the art of poetry. Are we to hold court in
sealed chambers with poets and nobody but? The phatic hum of all those
echoes -- "here I am, I am a poet too," "yes i am a poet," "poet,"
"poet" -- would be so perfectly self-cancelling as to obviate any sense
we might have had that we'd cleared a special place for poetry. Poetry
under such conditions would simply disappear. As in Oppen, the rocks
and waves aren't all that impressed with your status as a poet, either,
but it doesn't release you from the obligation to let them enter your
poetry if that's where you find yourself.

But again, this is probably more than is warranted by one marginal
criticism (your reading of the passage from the Critique, an objection
that has been raised and answered so many times as to approach, itself,
the echo-chamber I sketched above), tacked on to the usual crude smear
campaign with its Pol Pots and zombie armies of brain-devouring Marxist
poets. Mmmmmmm, brains....

The German director Fassbinder's "Fear Eats the Soul," I think. It was
years
ago I saw it. Another absolutely frightening great movie whose title I
do not
remember, "Bad Day...." It has Spencer Tracy as a one-armed outsider
coming by
train to a town in the middle of the desert. Robert Ryan is the head of
a
gang in the town. The movie has the structure of a Western, but it is
not. Tracy
is in civilian black clothes, wounded in the Second World War. It is his

civilian black suit which stir up suspicions first. Many westerns deal
with the
theme of the outsider coming to town -a recent example, Clint Eastwood's
"The

The German director Fassbinder's "Fear Eats the Soul," I think. It was
years
ago I saw it. Another absolutely frightening great movie whose title I
do not
remember, "Bad Day...." It has Spencer Tracy as a one-armed outsider
coming by
train to a town in the middle of the desert. Robert Ryan is the head of
a
gang in the town. The movie has the structure of a Western, but it is
not. Tracy
is in civilian black clothes, wounded in the Second World War. It is his

civilian black suit which stir up suspicions first. Many westerns deal
with the
theme of the outsider coming to town -a recent example, Clint Eastwood's
"The
Unforgiven."

a contradiction in terms, but I'm not avese to those) produced?....Lutheran

I would like to point out that Luther was a profound anti-Semite; so was
Marx; and each of them had a vision of society that took as fundamental to
its structure the validity and necessity of hating Jews. (Go look at Marx's
"On The Jewish Question," and read Sander Gilman's treatment of it in Jewish
Self-Hatred as a precursor to Marxism proper; it's interesting.) Now, I am
more sympathetic to Marxism than I am to Lutheran Christianity, or to
religion, really, of any sort, because Marxism, as I understand it-and I
admit my understanding is shallow at best-is a much more flexible way of
reading the world than religion tends to be, but I find it hard to trust any
ideology that takes the hatred of any group as necessary and valid part of
its own structure. (And I do take this same stance towards capitalist
democracy and the way it has needed and nurtured racism, at least in the US,
to fuel its growth.) This is not to say that the model of society offered by
Luther might not indeed be preferable to the one offered by Marx, or vice
versa; it is to say, however, that to take Luther or Marx or any other
politician or artist or whatever as a model without also explicitly
acknowledging and taking responsibility for the ways in which that model is
racist or sexist or choose-your-"ist" is, on some level, to reproduce that
"ism." I just think we need to be careful of that.

hi Millie,
           how are you? sorry I haven't replied to your e-mails.By the way
where do you live?
I'm curious because if I come over to the USA we could meet up and go over
some poetry.
I'm a published writer of poetry and comedy.And I'm thinking of puting
together a great new book of poems for 2004. Have you by chance seen any of
my works on the EPC web site?
You might remember the Sci Fi poem "Psi Light" which was a univocalic
poem,meaning that it
employed the use of only one vowel throughout the poem.I like these sorts of
writings because
they aren't common and can reveal some really interesting thought patterns.
I'd like to see some more of your work Millie,can you send me some samples?

Subject:      New Origin
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

Back from Kyoto--Chuck Sandy says that there will be issues of the New
Origin on line at www.neworigin.com. There are also plans for a print
version via Bob Arnold. Watch for it and subscription queries welcome. All
good news.  Cid had two issues ready to go before fate took him.

A handful of people came to see Cid off.  Had his funeral happened in
Boston or San Francisco no doubt hundreds would have come.  As it was, a
sub-basement viewing room and a scratchy tape of Pachabel's Canon had to
suffice.

The casket was made of unvarnished wood with a white sheet covering half of
it.  One could see Cid's face through a window.  Shizumi had put his
glasses on him and he was wearing his favorite shirt and his beloved
artist's beret.  On the altar behind the casket were positioned a great
beaming picture of Cid, looking happy, and well--Cid-like--and a couple of
electric Christmas candles.  A stand was placed in front of the casket
where one stick of incense burned in a brazier.

Steel folding chairs were lined up on either side.

When viewing time was over, the casket was opened and everyone placed
sprigs of flowers inside.

The funeral procession--all two cars of it--wound up a small mountain,
where the crematorium was located.  We were ushered into a hall with yet
another altar.  Cid's casket was sitting high up on a metal gurney behind
the altar.  A lady monk (bald head smooth as a baby's cheek) came to say
one short sutra for Cid, then we filed around the back of the altar to see
Cid's face one last time.  Then a man dressed in a police-type uniform and
wearing white gloves took Cid's casket into a long hall with various metal
doors in the wall and maneuvered the casket up to the door marked
Ko-RU-MAN-SAN, tripped a switch and the door opened.  Everyone said one
last farewell, bowed and prayed as the coffin was deposited onto a metal
track and the steel doors closed behind it.

We were all directed into a pleasant waiting hall where we enjoyed tea and
small talk for about 50 minutes.  Our lady guide then took us into another
building where Cid's bones and ashes awaited us on a metal table.  Each one
of us, beginning with Shizumi, took chopsticks and selected a bone and
placed it into a ceramic container.  We started with Cid's feet, then his
head area, then his chest.  The special throat or buddha bone had been
removed ahead of time.  After all of us did this, the funeral guide
described the significance of the buddha bone to us, pointing out buddha's
head, shoulders, etc.

I couldn't help wondering what Cid would have made of all of this, but it
clearly helped the family come to grips with the finality of Cid's end.

And that was the funeral.  Dust to dust and ashes to ashes.

I talked with Chuck about the idea of a special memorial reading for Cid in
the U.S., so that all of Cid's friends could come together to celebrate his
life and works.  More information on that in future.

I think poetix has developed a new genre in the last week or so: the
poet-memorial review.  slightly different from the poet-obit folks
send on occasion.

The Arts and Death: A Fugue for Sidney Cox

I think always how we always miss it. Not
anything is ever entirely true.

Death dominates my mind. I
Do not stop thinking how time will stop.
How time has stopped, does stop. Those dead--
their done time. Time does us in.

Mark how we make music, images,
how we term words, name names,
how, having named, assume the named begins
here, stops there, add this attribute,
subtract this other: here the mold begins
to harden. This toy soldier has
edges, can be painted, picked up,
moved from place to place, used to mean
one or many. Within the game we play,
we understand. See his leaden gun
or saber, how deadly for aid or for
destruction as we aim him, and he is bold,
a game soldier. We play games
however serious we aim to be.
A true aim, a toy soldier, I think
always, how we always miss the aim.

Ponder the vast debris of the dead, the great
uncounted numbers, the long, the endless list
of only their names, if anyone knew their names.
Joined to the dead already, to those known
who have died already, are we not also joined
to many we would have known in their time--
to one in Ilium, say, who thought of the dead?
In the world's long continuum, it is not
the names of the dead, but the dead themselves who are like
names, like terms, toy soldiers, words.

I think always how we always miss it; how the dead
have not been final, and life has always required
to be stated again, which is not ever stated.
It is not art's statements only, not
what we try to say by music,  not the way
this picture sculptures sight itself
to see this picture--not by art alone
the aim is missed, and even least of all
by art (which tries a whole world at once,
a composition). No, it is in our terms,
the terms themselves, which break apart, divide,
discriminate, set chasms in that wide,
unbroken experience of the senses which
goes on and on, that radiation inward and out,
that consciousness which we divide, compare,
compose, make things and persons of, make forms,
make I and you. World, world, I am scared
and waver in awe before the wilderness
of raw consciousness, because it is all
dark and formlessness: and it is real
this passion that we feel for forms. But the forms
are never real. Are not really there. Are not.

I think always how we always miss the real.

There still are wars though all the soldiers fall.

We live in a world we never understand.

Our lives end nothing. Oh there is never an end.

I am put off by this.  Tony sent me this email backchannel, as well as
posting on the list.

I didn't to my knowledge, ever email Tony Follari.

Secondly, I searched for him on EPC, and he does not appear to be on the
site anywhere.

Third, I googled him and found a posting of his on "Hitler Humor" which was
decidely not funny.  Thus, I am rather frightened of this person (it seems
like electronioc stalking), and I am happy that he seems to be safely
ensconced in New Zealand.  In any case, he seems not to be who he says he
is.

Please forgive me if I actually have written to Tony (though I think I'd
remember).  I don't intend to flame him, but I fear he may be stalking
others, thus a warning needs to be posted.

SAY 'NO' TO MARRIAGE DISCRIMINATION IN THE CONSTITUTION!

We cannot stand by idly while our opponents attempt to permanently
exclude lesbians and gays from the right to marry. It's time to send a
message to Congress in support of same-sex marriage.

Take action now!

Please forward to those you think might be interested in this position
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Hi all,

I'm looking for someone in the five boroughs of New York City who'd like to be
the new East Village editor of Boog City.

The editor would be responsible for getting 1-2 pages per month filled with
community news and features, including stories on neighborhood personalities,
local political disputes, and trends. In general, all things local that don't
fall under the scope of our music, printed matter, or small press editors. But
if there's an interesting new record label based in the East Village, the East
Village editor would work together with the music editor to find someone to
write about the label.

This person would also play a large part in our coverage of the Republican
National Convention this coming summer.

The East Village editor need not write any of the stories but may write some if
so desired.

Please backchannel to editor@boogcity.com if you are interested.

thanks,
david

forthcoming--mute magazineDR. BLOGGER; OR HOW I STOPPED HATING, AND LEARNED TO LOVE, THE POETRY BLOG Subverting the Cybersnobs
I know HTML, JavaScript, PHP, and some Perl. I've worked with MySQL databases and undocumented features of Macromedia Flash. I know the difference between headers and cookies. And on certain feverish nights I've dreamed in code.

That's why when Brandon Barr, webmaster of the texturl web log and co-coordinator of the banner art site, first told me just how popular these web logs ("blogs" for short) were becoming, I scoffed. And why my initial disdain for the form deepened when I noted just how popular blogs were becoming with poets.

It all just seemed too simple for me. As an artist whose primary interest was the intersection of computer science and literature, the Blogger phenomenon, wherein any poet could publish to the web with minimal or no knowledge at all of HTML, seemed beside the point. Where was the rich interweaving of multimedia and reactivity that is so alluring in digital poetics and net.art? Any cursory look at poets' blogs will reveal that the only things that break with literature's tradition of monolithic, static text there are links and images, all too often pointing only to other poets' blogs. From a distance, it looked like just another way for the old boys' network of contemporary American poetics to co-opt the growing migration of literature from page to file, and to enjoy an aura of innovation that few of them had earned.


All of this, of course, was before I got a blog.

Now, at this point one may ask: if you had such a dim view of blogs, Mr. LaCook, why did you feel the need to have one yourself? After all, you know HTML, JavaScript, PHP and some Perl. You've worked with databases. Heck, you could even write your own version of Blogger, the wildly popular online blog publishing system. With all of this in your repertoire, why would you start a blog, and on Blogger none-the-less?

Well, be patient. This is a love story, but not one about love at first site...er, sight.


Subject, Blog, Object
I started the Stamen Pistol blog in September of 2003. I'd been poring over numerous poets' blogs on the Net, from Nada Gordon's stellar poem blog prrrrowess (unfortunately, abandoned since August 2003) to Eileen Tabios' Love's Last Gasps, and I decided that I liked the easy access blogs provided to poetry by writers I liked. Sometimes, I just want to read.

It's that simple urge to read that blogs satisfy for me. Yes, as an artist, I love using the Net as a medium--dynamic text that assembles itself anew every session based on random processes and/or user input thrills me (and perhaps someday soon I will write a blog whose entries are entirely dynamic) but even I began my artistic life in an offline medium: writing itself. Before I first logged on, I was a poet, and, egocentric as it seems at first blush, text generated by individual human beings, one word at a time, is still quite often damned interesting reading.

Stamen Pistol is a group poetry blog whose member list grows monthly. Originally, the blog's contributors included myself, Sheila E. Murphy and Allen Bramhall; as of today, blog members also include Cyril Donnelly, Lendon Heide, Mez, and Daniel Carter. There are some members who don't post (Nada Gordon is one, and Nick Piombino, whose own blog fait accompli is perhaps the second most well-known poet's blog out there, next to Ron Silliman's). All members have administrative privileges; they can edit or delete posts at will, not only their own (it doesn't happen very often, but the option is there). At this point the membership list is exactly the sort of mix of well-known contemporary poets (Sheila Murphy's work has appeared just about everywhere one finds poetry, and she is arguably one of the most influential poets writing today; Allen Bramhall co-edits Potes and Poets Press; Mez is the legendary net.artist and codeworker whose work has helped shape the experience of languag
 e
 online) and newcomers (Lendon Heide, I don't believe, knew what a blog was until I showed her Stamen Pistol) that weaves the kind of textual pastiche I most love. Today's front page looks something like this:

This snippet (which will change overnight, as members add poems or build poems from poems already posted) illustrates the basic blog format: time stamped entries ordered by date, the most recent entries appearing at the very top of the page. This form lends itself well to archiving. What separates the blog most from the printed book or chapbook of poems is just this sort of reliance on a database structure, as opposed to the more narrative approach print implies. Any book of poems in which each individual piece is quite intentionally where it is lives fully within a narrative structure, even if no explicit narrative is visible. The sequence of poems on a poem blog, however, is determined programmatically, impersonally; it's a simple call to a database, in which tables of data are ordered in a reverse chronology and formatted in a friendly way.

This might be why the first poets to take to the blog form in a big way were L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E and post-L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E writers. One of the most significant breaks with tradition these poets enacted was a willingness to experiment with "new" ordering principles within the poem; unity of voice was something to play with, as well as linear monological structure and the concept of closure; many of these works read like lists of linguistic or sensory phenomena. Some are aware of the debt they owe in this to earlier American poets who also challenged form: read a poem by Whitman and one senses alternative methods of organization just on the horizon.


What it is, what it was, what it could be
Blogs use database logic because blogs are database logic.

In their original incarnation, a web blog was in essence a links page--a common grotto in the sites of today, but blogs sought to deliberately filter the dizzying morass of information available on the Net via daily or semi-daily updates. Commentary was often included, helping to further mediate the cacophony of sites. The Net user could look at a blog and get a different take on news events of the day; blogs shone light into often little-traversed corners, gleaning tidbits that might interest their readers.

Of course, today's blog is more commentary than link list, and the form has become a sort of public diary for many users. LiveJournal , Blogger's only serious competition, built this aspect of blogging directly into its name.

Something else that happened in the evolution of blogs was the diminishing need to know HTML. Before Blogger and LiveJournal provided users with friendly GUIs for online publishing, bloggers had to know HTML in order to construct their spaces. Both Blogger and LiveJournal have eliminated that need; both provide a simple textfield, with some buttons to automate link creation and other HTML mark-up capabilities, as the conduit to fast web publishing. The skill set needed to publish a blog is relatively sparse. You have to be able to navigate to the editing page, and be able to type.

So while data dandies like myself may initially scoff at the simplicity of blogging, there's really something quite profound in the fact that one doesn't need heaps of knowledge to have a blog. Finally, public expression is available to anyone who can use language and has access to a computer. While in the Nineties the Net seemed to promise liberation in the form of home pages, we now have the blog, and the swiftness and ubiquity of blogging point to a utopian phase of human life wherein everyone can have their say, and everyone can be an author.

It's an exciting phase, to be sure. When the second Gulf War broke out, many turned to the Salam Pax/Raed blog to find out just what was happening in Iraq through the eyes of an Iraqi. There have been some doubts as to the authenticity of the blog (we never know just precisely where anything is coming from on the Net, do we?), but the blog did play an integral part in the anti-war push here in the U.S. and in Great Britain. Raed showed us the human face of our own colonial urge.

And that's what blogs do. They humanize the Net. Sure, net.art and digital poetics may be forging new forms with their interweaving of aesthetics and computer science, but blogs are the intimate spaces where humanity truly speaks through the bytes.

Taylor, Alan, and Jesse (I think the name was?)

These are good enough responses for now.  I like wiggle room, and that's
where you got my interest.  Wiggle room.  A bit of independence.  Your
sophisticated take on determines and conditions may well allow Some of that.

I haven't got a lot of time to write today.

I imagine that Marx is more anti-Semitic than Luther, but I am not sure how
such things are quantified.  Luther loved Jews, and talks about them in a
positive sense in many different places in Table Talks -- however, there was
a price on Luther's head (set by the Catholic church) and toward the end of
his life Luther got wind that there was a Jewish conspiracy against him.  He
let go with some vehement blasts.  But this was a matter of context, and
isn't integral to his thought.  It's not clear that the plot was real.
Luther was delusionary in his final years.

In his youth and middle age he frequently cites the Old Testament and loved
King David, and says, "What a people!"

All this in a positive sense.

So again, wiggle room.

In a letter to Engels Marx wrote about the theorist Lasalle that "he has the
dirty blood of a negro Jew."

And yet he is somehow the foundation stone of multiculturalism.

Ironic, I think.

I have to run out of here, but will try to reply at further length later.
I've read most of the texts Alan names, but I'm no specialist.  I tend to
prefer to deal at length with humorous writings, and only read the theory
because I have to.  Do like Fourier, of course, for the humor.  And to some
extent writers such as Max Stirner.  I find a lot of Marxist theory to be
completely humorless, and this is a real problem for me.  There's another
problem when theory becomes completely silly, as it often does in Zizek, for
instance, but I prefer that problem.

At any rate, if Lutheran surrealism isn't kosher, we can always try
Pentecostal surrealism.  Speaking in tongues is something that poets and
Pentecostals share in common.  Maybe that's next?  I'll ponder it.

But why bring Christianity into it at all? Any sort of monotheism is going
to have problems, and Christianity for me is a foreign territory. I've
read - years ago admittedly - some of Luther's tracts, by the way, and
they were violently anti-semitic; there's no excuse, and they caused
enormous damage. As far as Marx goes, you might as well look at Gilman's
book on Jewish Self-Hatred and it may give you a different viewpoint. I
don't think you understand this issue at all, unfortunately -

Not only that, but Ashcroft is also a Pentecostal. What a unifying movement

Every time I have seen that term used it has referred to the words of
a Jewish person who suggests that some things can be improved in a
Jewish community.

Hi Ela, Chris, and everyone else,

the best resource for all this information is www.poetz.com/calendar, it's put
together by Jackie Sheeler and is beyond thorough. Jackie let us here at Boog
City use her info (which we then supplemented a bit) for our own New York City
Poetry Calendar, sponsored by Bob Holman and the Bowery Poetry Club. If you're
a planner like I am, you'll wanna go online and plan ahead. If you wanna
physical rundown, grab the March Boog City whilst downtown, and stuff it in yr
bag and go.

that said, some quick picks on the rdgs during your two separate stays:

the two big wknd series in nyc are the segue series, which are held saturday's
at 4 p.m. at the Bowery Poetry Club, 308 Bowery at Bleecker, and the zinc bar
series, sunday's at 7 p.m. at the zinc bar, 90 W. houston st. (off laguardia)

Segue

Sat. 4/20--Anselm Berrigan and Abigail Child
Sat. 4/27--Steven Roderfer and Nada Gordon

Zinc

Sun. 4/21--Mark Salerno and Macgregor Card
Sun. 4/28--Jim Behrle and Jen Benka

If you wanna read while you're in town, there are a slew of open mics (again on
either poetz.com or backcover of boog city). My fave among them is the "Our
Unorganized Reading" at ABC No Rio, 156 Rivington St., where there are no
lists, to time limits, and, as they put it, "no bullshit." It's a pretty warm
space.

Other ones i'd check out:

Fri. 3/19, 5 p.m., BowPoClub--Douglas Rothschild's Poetry Game Show
Fri. 3/19 and 3/26, 10 p.m., Nuyorican Poets Cafe, 236 E.3rd St. (bet. b &
C)--feature poet (19th Eve Packer, 26th TBA), followed by slam, and then
midnight open mic
Thurs.  3/25--7 p.m., Urbana Poetry Slam at BowPoClub (run by the National Slam
Poetry champs)

and i'm always game for hooking up with visitors and showing them my city. use
this here email or the below #.

as ever,
david

Taylor, Joe, Alan, Rodrigo, and anybody interested in the history and idea
of the model of a Marxian social in poetry --

You might be interested in an essay I have coming out in _XCP: Cross
Cultural Poetics_ #14: "After 1923: 'The Social Command'." I argue that it
is only after the Russian Revolution via this slogan - the social command -
that a Marxian model of the social becomes explicitly modified for literary
ends by poets; "social command" is the ur instantiation of social formalism
in the revolutionary 20th century. The other year I posted on this listserv
a translation of a 1973 French text about this term. In the essay, I trace
it from Mayakovsky and Brik through and beyond Watten, and examine what it
opens up for it to have currency today.

There are many different models of the social in poetry. The one
contemporary to Marx's that any teacher must implicitly wrestle with, even
today, is Matthew Arnold's.

Best free things to do in NY--a. walk as much as possible b. take the
staten island ferry.

At the Met if you read the fine print you'll notice (but no one does) that
you have to pay something for admission, but not the what is it now 12
dollars they ask for. I usually flip them a quarter. Nobody cares.

Louis, Can't wait to read your article!  May I also suggest that in addition to
Marx and Arnold there is another heavyweight one must wrestle with in this

Pragmatism, verifiably invented the notion of "symbolic action" that Kenneth
Burke later puts to such good use, and who in his own day caused Matthew Arnold
not a little anxiety on the subject (read "To a Republican Friend," Arnold's
brilliant but insipidly conservative poem addressed to Emerson-devotee Arthur
Hugh Clough, ca. 1849).  -m.

The full title of Gilman's book is Jewish Self-Hatred: Anti-Semitism and the
Hidden Language of the Jews, and it is a book, actually, that I think people
on this list might be very interested in because at its heart is an
examination of the anti-Semitic canard of the Jews' secret language and how
that canard effected Jews throughout history, starting with the problem of
identity faced by medieval Jewish converts to Christianity. The book is a
wonderful investigation of: the relationship between language and identity,
language and the center/margin(s) of a culture and more. One aspect of the
book that I think would interest people on this list, given the very
passionate investments that writers, perhaps especially poets, often have in
supporting/being a part of particular schools of writing as opposed to
others, is the way Gilman analyzes the relationship in anti-Semitic thought
between the idea of the hidden language of the Jews and journalism, which
was for a long time understood in Europe to be a quintessentially Jewish and
therefore by definition impoverished form of expression. (I must confess
that I do not remember the book well enough to say much more than that; my
own research right now concerns what Gilman has to say about stuff that went
on in the Middle Ages and so that's where my attention is focused.)

Another thing Gilman does, apropos of George Bowering's point--"Every time I
have seen that term used it has referred to the words of a Jewish person who
suggests that some things can be improved in a Jewish community"--is the way
in which the notion Jewish self-hatred became pathologized within the Jewish
community as the "sickness" contracted by a Jew who was in denial of, or not
in proper relationship with, his "true" Jewish self and therefore his own
best interests.

Damn that Hidden Language... where did we leave it again? Somewhere,
somewhere...

Oh! In the imagination of racist lunatics.

On reflection, maybe that wasn't such a smart hiding place.

Kirby Olson wrote:

>>Luther loved Jews<<

This is from Sander Gilman's Jewish Self-Hatred, and it coincides with
everything I have ever read or heard about Luther and the Jews:

"It is usual to divide Martin Luther's interest in the Jews into three
phases, roughly coinciding with the main biographical periods of his life:
the young Catholic Luther, for whom the Jews played little or no role,
except as figures within biblical commentary; the Luther in rebellion
against the Church, who assumed that his cleansing of Christianity from the
evils of the Church would persuade Jews to convert; and the established
Luther, embittered by the Jews' refusal to convert to the newly purged
doctrine and violent in his language and attitude towards them."

Gilman goes on to talk about Luther's instability, which Kirby Olson
mentions, and then argues that you can in fact connect Luther's late,
virulent anti-Semitism to his earlier attitudes towards the Jews by looking
at what he had to say about Jewish converts. Gilman argues, in other words,
that Luther was never not an anti-Semite, though is anti-Semitism might not
have been so obvious and explicit when he was a young man. This is a complex
argument within the book that I am not going to try to summarize here,
though I will say it is pretty persuasive to me. What I want to point out
here is that the second stage of Luther's interest in the Jews, where he was
hoping they would convert, is hardly love and is, in itself, in its implicit
and explicit denial of the validity of Judaism as a religion,
anti-Semitic--or, since anti-Semitism was not a term used in Luther's time,
and if you prefer the term, as some do, Jew-hating--on its face.

I have no doubt that Luther said and wrote many important things and that he
is a thinker one needs to come to terms with/account for; and I will also
freely confess that I have not, but I do know this: to characterize as love
what I have just described seems to me to be either a willful misreading of
history or a profound corruption/falsification/misapprehension of the nature
of love.

The list seems to have gone into a funky write-only mode (posts are
getting made through email but not the web interface and nothing is
coming back out) since about 3pm EST Friday 3/12. Alan and I are
trying to make sense of it but none of the things we've tried seem to
be helping. Alan is now contacting AOL to have them kick the server
in the pants for us. please be aware you are not alone in getting no
mail and that it is being looked into.

Thanks, Jim and Alan

i can chime in too; this book is full of strange and interesting
anecdotes, a strong and interesting thesis, and good historical
scope.   i thought he must have a dozen research assistants to come

WORKSHOPS

Sign-up for one class or for the remaining three:

So You Say You Can't Write Poetry? with Marj Hahne
Three Wednesdays, March 17, 24, 31, 7 - 9 p.m.; $100, $85 for members

As children we were natural poets, but by adulthood, we likely suppressed
some of the sensibilities that enliven our reading and writing of poetry:
(1) a fascination with wordplay and the infinite possibilities of language,
(2) an alert sensory perception, (3) recognition and acceptance of our
unique voice, and (4) patience with our learning process. Designed for the
beginning or tentative poet (although practiced poets will find it
enriching, too!), this educational and fun workshop will present accessible
poetic forms, sample poems, and prompts as structures that allow for the
possibility of poetry as we uncover or recover our individual poetic voices.
We will create a safe space for generating lots of original writing while
attending to the particulars of craft: language choices, the poem's shape,
and various poetic devices.

Marj Hahne is a poet and teaching artist from New York City. Her work has
appeared in Painted Bride Quarterly, Mad Poets Reviews, La Petite Zine,
Rogue Scholars, & New England Writer's Network. She also has a CD entitled,
notspeak.

How to Write and Sell Essays, Short Stories, Travel and Feature Articles,
with Kathryn Radeff

3 Saturdays, March 13, 20, 27, and April 3 10-12 a.m. $135, $110 for
members. Single class $35, $30 members

The magazine field is overflowing with opportunity. With the right approach
you can craft articles, sell and re-sell to worldwide publications. Open to
everyone, this four-week special workshop focuses on the fundamentals
editors are looking for and  resents the secret to writing great marketing
letters. Through in-class and at-home exercises, Kathryn Radeff provides a
fun, effective, and motivational workshop designed to inspire the writer and
develop creative confidence. The workshop also includes creative
self-promotion methods and the business end of publishing. It is recommended
that you purchase the four guidebooks from the "You Can Be A Working Writer"
series at $5.95 each.

JUST BUFFALO CHOOSES BOOKER PRIZE-WINNING NOVEL, THE GOD OF SMALL THINGS FOR
2004 IF ALL OF BUFFALO READ THE SAME BOOK

BUFFALO - Just Buffalo Literary Center has chosen The God of Small Things,by
Arundhati Roy, as the centerpiece of its 4th If All Buffalo Read The Same
Book program, which will culminate in a two-day author's visit on September
8-9, 2004. The God of Small Things won the 1997 Booker Prize for literature,
Great Britain's highest literary honor. Arundhati Roy became the first
non-expatriate Indian author and the first Indian woman to win the award.
The New York Times called the book "dazzling" and "remarkable," while the
Washington post noted, "It's hard to avoid using words like 'splendid' and
'stunning' to describe this debut novel."

individuals who would like more information or a reader's guide, as well as
those interested in sponsorship, can contact Just Buffalo at 832-5400 or by

>
> For Luther, however, there could be a non-religious art.  He said artists were

>

>

University President Accused of Plagiarism
By STACEY STOWE

http://www.nytimes.com/2004/03/12/nyregion/12college.html?pagewanted=3Dpr=
int&position=3D

NEW BRITAIN, Conn., March 11 - Two years after his
arrest on charges that he impersonated a police
officer, the president of Central Connecticut State
University is scheduled to appear before university
trustees next week to respond to allegations that he
committed plagiarism in a newspaper opinion article.

Richard L. Judd, the university president since 1996,
has been accused of borrowing material from at least
three sources without attribution when he wrote a Feb.
26 article for The Hartford Courant about the conflict
between Greece and Turkey over the island of Cyprus.

Through a university spokesman, Mr. Judd, 66, declined
to comment.=20

Days after the article was published, a reader
contacted The Courant to report mistakes, said John J.
Zakarian, the newspaper's editorial page editor. The
paper published a correction. The same reader later
noted similarities between Mr. Judd's article and an
editorial on the same topic that appeared Jan. 7,
2003, in The New York Times.

Mr. Judd wrote, "The divided island has for too long
been contorted by tensions between Turkey and
Greece.'' The first line of The Times editorial was:
"The divided Mediterranean island of Cyprus, long
contorted by tensions between Turkey and Greece, can
look forward to a more promising future if the Turkish
Cypriot leadership accepts a United Nations peace
plan.'' In addition, two other sentences in the two
pieces were virtually identical.

In response, The Courant asked a company in Oakland,
Calif., to analyze the article for evidence of
plagiarism. The review found that at least 20 percent
of the material in the piece was not original, said
John M. Barrie, the president of the company,
iParadigms. The analysis found Mr. Judd had borrowed
an entire paragraph from a Web site belonging to the
Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus, Mr. Barrie said.

When asked by The Courant about the similarities, Mr.
Judd responded in writing, saying he mistook notes he
had made for a speech on the same topic as his own,
when they may have come from books, articles and
papers he had consulted.

"I should have done a better job of vetting my text,''
he was quoted as saying in a Courant article on
Tuesday written by Mr. Zakarian.

In a telephone interview on Thursday, Mr. Zakarian
said: "I'm angry. Our credibility has been hurt and
our readers were not well served.''

In the past three years, Mr. Judd wrote two other
opinion pieces for the paper: one on campus free
speech and the other on the Middle East. Both have
been reviewed.

"To the best of our knowledge, we can't see that he
lifted anything,'' Mr. Zakarian said of those pieces.=20

The university is conducting its own review of the
Feb. 26 article. William Cibes, chancellor of the
state university system, said his staff found that it
borrowed from another source without attribution: an
April 27, 2003, article in The Independent, a British
newspaper.

Asked his reaction to the allegations about Mr. Judd,
whom he considers a friend, Mr. Cibes said:
"Disbelief. Heartsick.''=20

After meeting with him, the trustees could decide to
dismiss Mr. Judd, who earns $199,000 a year, said the
president of the board of trustees, Lawrence D.
McHugh. Or they could choose less severe options, like
a reprimand or suspension, he said.

Mr. Judd was reprimanded by the board in 2002 after
using flashing lights on his car and pretending his
university identification was a police badge to pull
over a driver in Newington. He was sentenced to 30
days' probation in the incident.=20

The son of factory workers, Mr. Judd caddied and
worked at a grocery store to pay his tuition at
Central, where he graduated in 1959 with honors,
according to a university newsletter. He wrote a book
on emergency medicine, "The First Responder: The
Critical First Minutes,'' published in 1982 by C. V.
Mosby.

On the university campus, where posters warning
against plagiarism hang in the hallways of academic
buildings, students said on Thursday that they were
embarrassed by the allegations.

"It kind of gives us a bad name,'' said Katharine
Westover, a 19-year-old sophomore from Moosup, Conn.
"There should be some serious consequences for him.''

Another sophomore, Aaron Bohigian, 19, of Southington,
said he was "appalled'' when he heard about the latest
incident.

"I'm going to try to get into graduate school from
here and this is really embarrassing,'' he said. "A
slap on the face.''

An Examination Of Academic Ethics
Judd Should Take Retirement Route
Stan Simpson, Hartford Courant

March 13 2004

Richard L. Judd should not be forced to resign as
president of Central Connecticut State University next
week solely because he apparently plagiarized sections
of a commentary piece published in The Courant.=20

But he should retire when the semester ends in May.
Three times in the past two years his actions have
brought great embarrassment to this academic
institution he adores.

Mr. President, it's time.

In February 2002 Judd was arrested and charged with
impersonating a police officer. After flashing a badge
and activating specially installed flashing lights on
his car, Judd, who has extensive experience in
emergency medical services and public safety - pulled
over a motorist he believed was driving recklessly on
Route 9.

Last November, Judd undermined the authority of
Athletic Director C.J. Jones in firing football coach
Paul Schudel, without consulting Jones. That
disrespectful act resulted in intense negative media
for the university, union grievances and a $200,000
settlement for Schudel, who was wrongfully linked to
the possible misuse of players' meal money.

Now, the campus and alums like me have to endure the
imbroglio over Judd's commentary on the conflict in
Cyprus that ran last month in The Courant. Judd is
accused of lifting text from the New York Times and
another source, without attributing it.=20

He claims it was unintentional. Maybe it was, and
frankly, don't university presidents have
speechwriters to do this stuff? But Judd's confusing
behavior over the past 24 months has been compounding
and confounding. An arrest, a reprimand from the board
of trustees, the demeaning treatment of a longtime
Central stalwart such as Jones, the $200,000 "oops, my
bad" payoff to Schudel and now accusations of
plagiarism. Enough.

"Whether it's a mistake or not, with the position that
he's in, there's only so much you can take," says Joe
Kondracas, a Central sophomore. "He's supposed to be
responsible and not make those kind of mistakes. It's
like how much more can [the board of trustees] take?"

We'll find that out next week, when trustees are
expected to discuss the matter with Judd.

"He has done some questionable things in the past, and
it seems to be adding up more and more each time,"
says Joe Carcaud, a Central senior, who is general
manager of WFCS-radio, the campus station. "It seems
to be a bigger offense [each time]. ... I've met him.
He's a very good guy, a very personable person. But
you have to set a good example."

Personally, I'm very fond of Judd. He's offbeat,
salty, learned and a little eccentric. This is a guy
who grew up in the Bridgeport projects and has had an
array of jobs in his 40 years at his alma mater - from
waiting tables to being the first alum to head CCSU.

Under Judd's leadership, the campus has sparkled with
hundreds of millions of dollars in improvements, a
more diverse student population and an elevation in
prestige. No one loves Central more than Judd. This
Blue Devil bleeds blue.

He humbled me last year by asking me to give the
commencement speech at Central's post-graduate
ceremony, then surprised me with the President's medal
for my work in journalism. This year, I was asked by
Judd, through his administration, to be an honorary
co-chairperson of the CCSU Alumni Association's "Read
Across America" literacy program.

At a private lunch Judd and I had in his chambers last
summer, we had a wide-ranging conversation, including
the possibility of a more meaningful role for me at
the university. Dick Judd has treated me with the
utmost respect. I hate to see him going out like this,
but his wounds are self-inflicted.

If the charge against Judd were just one count of
plagiarism, I would be making the case that discipline
was needed, not retirement.

Heck, former Boston Globe columnist Mike Barnicle, a
serial plagiarist and fabricator, just got hired to be
a columnist at the Boston Herald, the newspaper that
exposed his transgressions. Sen. Joseph Biden of
Delaware is still going strong years after it was
determined that he didn't attribute sections from a
speech he once gave. A Courant colleague's career
seems to have rebounded after a 30-day suspension last
year for ripping off someone else's work.

Judd's fate should not rest solely on the academic
integrity of his opinion column. More troubling is the
compilation of bad decisions best described as
sophomoric.

At 66, Dick Judd has the energy level of the Energizer
bunny. But his ability to lead this university and
command the respect of its constituents has eroded.

It's time.

“Far Reports”  by Mark Salerno

Farther is blue

One slow eye blink.
The world is far

you'd have. Say words.
Far world. Blue.
People. Closer.

Mike, thanks for mentioning your fascinating work in this context. It's
curious to see the indirect presence of Emerson in Arnold, for example in
Arnold's essay "Democracy," how he associates "self-reliance" with
resistance to and deferment of democracy and to the continuance of
aristocratic values, in a class-riven society such as England's. That Arnold
was leery of "symbolic action" is a keen point, and is certainly evident in
for example a Victorian Tintern Abbey poem such as "A Summer Night." It
would be interesting to contrast Arnold and Emerson for how they interpret
German Romanticism, particularly a notion such as "culture," which doesn't
quite translate "bildung."

On other matters, I don't know what you think about the supposed split
between "individual," or "private," or "personal," and "social" (is it there
in pragmatists?), but this split is the very symptom that Marx's theory of
the social addresses, moreover in very funny ways (Marx's writings have
GARGANTUAN - and in the Pantagruelian sense - humor: how could anyone who
has read Marx miss this?!). Marx wasn't the first to address this fantasy
Crusoeian split, either. It's not as well known, but Spinoza addresses it
via his critique of Hobbes, for instance - so, right at the cusp, there, of
the modern. It's a misreading (a stereotypical one, I'm sorry to say, so
it's hard for me to get worked up about addressing it -- and since you don't
yourself address it, Mike, I aplogize for doing so despite my own better
sense of it!) to think that one can take Marx to task for upholding this
split and for favoring the social over the individual. And I wonder if you
will agree with me that it's also a bit of a serious misjudgment for anyone
to think that this split even still applies in some sense to present
conditions and life. Does Rorty? Uh-uh. One doesn't have to read Marx or
Luther to think about how un-private "our" life has become; one doesn't even
have to read to think about it, but if one likes to read, then Christian
Parenti's recent book The Soft Cage is useful on this point.

Mike, I also have no idea why "we" "have" to agree "poetry is somehow
insufficient in and of itself." I have trouble understanding what such a
phrase, "in and of itself," means. That to me is indeed a blindspot of some
pragmatism, however. Aside from pragmatist terms, however, the way I
understand the phrase is that it beckons to a paradox of materialism. Steve
McCaffery raises this paradox in relation to the faded science of Derridian
grammatology: that writing, for Derrida - for all his emphasis on how it
secretly supplements and opposes speech - curiously rarely materializes as a
literal mark on the page. But, I for one put the paradox in the following
Brikian terms: there is no mark that is not a social mark.

Poetry is definitely "sufficient."

As Steve Evans pointed out some long time ago, Mike, isn't John Parker the
first to write a Lutherian poem, in the first issue of your magazine
_Combo_?

Best wishes to you,
Louis

Louis, I don't have the time right now to really respond to this in a way that
will do it justice -- you're addressing so much.  But, just for starters here's
Emerson in 1855 on "self-reliance":

"Whilst I insist on the doctrine of the independence and the inspiration of the
individual, I do not cripple but exalt the social action...to every man the
largest liberty compatible with the liberty of every other man.  No citizen
will go wrong who upon any question leans to the side of general liberty."

This notion of "general" liberty would seem to stamp indviduality as inherently
a social phenomenon. Similarly he suggests elsewhere (again, in the 1850s when
he's knee-deep in abolitionism) that the essence of self-reliance is to
"postpone oneself, to protect another from oneself."  That the theorist of
“self-reliance” should recommend that one “postpone oneself” seems
counterintuitive, but that stipulation was latent in Emerson’s conception of
self-reliance from the beginning. Anyone who wishes to posit a connection
between E.'s “self-reliance” and “rugged-individualism” needs to explain how
he/she works around the theoretical and practical implications of this concept
of “postponement.”  Such an explanation would necessarily include an engagement
with Emerson’s criticism of “an easy self-reliance that makes [one] self-willed
and unscrupulous...pampered by finer draughts, by political power and by the
power in the railroad board, in the mills, or the banks;” and his connection of
 “liberty” with “self-denial,” in “The Fortune of the Republic” (1863).

I don't think *I* suggested that "poetry is somehow insufficient in and of
itself" did I?  In any event I believe poetry is quite sufficient for precisely
the reasons you mention.  Nor did I mean to imply I was taking Marx to task, if
I did.  I think there's quite a bit of confluence between Marxism and
Pragmatism actually, just as there is alot of disagreement among Marxists and
among Pragmatists.  I'm no big fan of Rorty's but let's say that to read
Dewey's Art as Experience alongside Adorno's Aesthetic Theory is pretty
eye-opening.

Last thought for now: the crucial year, I think more and more, for this issue of
the social in poetry, in language, of symbolic action, etc etc, is the
revolutionary year 1848 (this isn't necessarily news, I know).  You see how
Arnold reacts in "To a Republican Friend." Emerson writes the essay "Kossuth."
To what extent is poetry, they all seem to be asking themselves, supposed to
participate in social revolution, and on which side?  Arnold's studied
disavowal of politics in that poem (itself highly political) remarkly predicts
the New Criticism and *it's* politics (particularly that of the Southern
agrarians Ransom, Tate et al).

Any-hoo....

Hello,
  I'm wondering if any of you can help with translating some basic poetry
words and concepts into Somali. I have a 5th grade female student who knows very
little English and has virtually no prior schooling. I'm not even sure how
much Somali she can read. I'm looking for basic words like poem, poetry, writer,
ideas, feelings, words for the five senses, relationship, comparison  etc.
Anything that might help me try to convey what the heck I am doing visiting her
class.

I read this excellent piece and I suddenly feel like throwing up. The more
transparent the lies become around this Administration - that we have been
living within a coup - the more anger emerges. Neo-Con Hell run amuck.
It's going to take every tool and level of pressure to evict these fools.
And so much more to cure the damage done.

=A0
Spring...
Discussions around the dinner table mainly focus on the Transitional Law
these days. I asked a friend to print out the whole thing for me and have
been looking it over these last two days. I watched only a part of the
ceremony because the electricity went out in the middle of it and I didn't
bother watching a recap of it later on.
The words look good on paper- as words often do. Some parts of it sound
hauntingly like our last constitution. The discussions about the
Transitional Law all focus on the legitimacy of this document. Basically, a=
n
occupying power brought in a group of exiles, declared Iraq 'liberated',
declared the constitution we've been using since the monarchy annulled and
set up a group of puppets as a Governing Council. Can these laws be
considered legitimate?
Furthermore, just how sincere are these puppets about this new Transitional
Law? For example, there's a lovely clause that reads, "No one may be
unlawfully arrested or detained, and no one may be detained by reason of
political or religious beliefs." Will the American troops discontinue the
raids and arbitrary detentions (which are still quite common) come June 30?
Or is the Transitional Law binding only to Iraqis?
One example of an arbitrary detention we heard about the other day was of a
man who was arrested in Tikrit. They raided his home and gathered the
25-year-old man, two brothers and an elderly uncle. They got the usual
treatment: a bag on the head, and hands behind their backs. They were taken
to a place outside of Tikrit and thrown into a barn-like area with bags on
their heads- still tied up. For 3 days, they were kicked and cursed by the
troops. In between the kicking and cursing, a hefty soldier would scream
questions at them and an interpreter would translate, "Are you part of
Al-Qaeda?! Do you know Osama bin Laden?!" On the third day, one of the youn=
g
men struck up a deal with who he gathered was their 'head'- the man who gav=
e
all the orders. They agreed that one of the soldiers would accompany the ma=
n
back to the city and wait while he came up with $300/detainee. The rest of
the men would be freed a couple of days later.
And it worked. Two days later, his three relatives came walking home after
being dropped off on the side of the road. Basically, they paid a ransom fo=
r
their freedom. Just one of the many stories about life in the 'New Iraq'- n=
o
wonder Chalabi was so jubilant while signing the Transitional Law document.
The country is currently like an unguarded bank- especially for those who
bear arms.=20
The general attitude towards the document is a certain weariness. Iraqis ar=
e
weary of everything 'transitional' and 'temporary'. I guess, after almost a
year of instability and strife, we just crave something more definite and
substantial.=20
Spring is in the air- and that means dust storms and a mellow sun for
Iraqis. We're enjoying the weather because by the end of April, summer will
be in full swing and the heat will come in almost palpable waves. The
mornings are slightly cool and by noon we've shed the jackets. We no longer
need the 'sopas' or kerosene heaters at home- which is a relief to E. who
has been designated the job of filling them up and making sure the kerosene
tank in the yard is always full (the kerosene man has become a dear friend)=
.
These last few days have brought back memories of the same dates, last year=
.
What were we doing in early March? We were preparing for the war=8A digging
wells, taping up windows, stocking up on candles, matches, kerosene, rice,
flour, bandages, and medicine=8A and what are we doing now? Using them.=20

If u know Trungpa then u know the advantage of 'having more material to
work with' (no confusion = no wisdom) is available ONLY IF you accept
things as they are.

So 'chaos should be regarded as extremely good news' only if there is
already an absence of any principle of rejection.

So *rejecting* 'monism' + evoking Trungpa's crazy wisdom appears to me,
at least, incompatible, or inconsistent (ie. shifty).

Trungpa's is a trick-saying since to regard anything as favorable is to
make friends with it and therefore more is more (Spinoza). The point
Trungpa is making, that I see, is to love ALL confusion and proceed in
an open way (no categories, no limit, no rejection). This is analogous,
I think, to Jesus saying 'love one another' by which he REALLY means it
(passion? no - it's precision) and not mockingly.

Dear Burt,

        I sent you a message Feb 2nd with several questions.  Apparently you've
been quite busy.  Perhaps you didn't have time to respond & it got filed
away.  I wondered if I might send it again without being too rude.  I
pasted that letter below.
        I hope you had a good trip, wherever it was that you went.  I continue
working on the Williams.  I've gone a bit further than that abstract I
sent, & need to replace it.  I've been able to get a whole of the
Zukofsky/Williams letters as well as a copy of Cureton's book on phrase
rhythm.  (I had to write to England for it!)  I've also been working on
the Whalen essay, & that's about ready to send.  I think you'll like it.
But I repeat, I've not heard a word from Sagetrieb in 15 months now.
        Hope all is well.

        Bruce


Hi Burt

        Thanks for your prompt response to the Conference submission.  I'm real
pleased that you all accepted my proposal.  I'm still working on the
thesis.  Do you have a date when that has to be submitted (for printing)?
 I should have it down soon.
        Also, did you think your way thru my suggestions on Gene Frumkin and
Bill Sylvester?  Half this interview I'm doing with Sylvester is on Henry
Rago, & that could be remade into a conference paper.
        And I suppose I should mention that I never did hear from Sagetrieb on
the Whalen essay you said they had accepted.  That's not a big problem so
far.  I've spent the time revising & it has become a much better essay.
        Hope you all are well.
        PS:  Did you read All Poets Welcome yet?

There's a wonderful cowboy angel figure taking dictation in the recent film Northfork.  Very Orphic and reminiscent of Spicer's "Billy".

i can't stop thinking of metal envelopes.

- ela


*  *  *

Metal has the properties of pained flesh.

Poets carrying backpacks speak the only universal language they remember.

Missives turn into missiles at the nudge of her elbow.

A banner advertising Nike folds into Niobe, "Rid of Madness."

The riverflow is Mercury.
Temperature rises with the crossbeam and the third rail
Runs as a conductor Rod.

Dismember the last flashes of memory:
Naked poets search garbage dumps sewers cemeteries
For something
To bandage the tongueblade
Taut ropes to walkto hang
Perhaps to hang
Laundry

Yet. Is as If. Completely White under the cunning horizon.

Aimed blindly
Transitional laws
Draw
Party lines
Sharper than -

Drew
Parting lines
Sharper than -

All this time the poet busied herself counting molecules.
The cell membrane was severed
He thought, Liberty
Death clad in colors of Dawn

Completely White
Right where the Accent falls
Letters severe as shards
Memory lost

Metal was consolation almost felt.

The state of Emergency inaugurated in the age of iron.

Annie,

A piece of Theresa Cha's "Dictee" appears near a poem of mine on the Addison
St. Poet's Walk in Berkeley  (weirdly, Theresa lived next door to me 26 years
ago), organized by Robert Hass. He chose 100 Berkeley poets, as well as some
others who he thought somehow embody the spirit of the place.  Why not contact
him at UC Berkeley and ask how he got permission to have these lines literally
engraved in plaques that are placed in the sidewalk?

Love, Gloria

I tried this but everything that came out of my computer was trite, banal,
too slight or too portentous for the task.

It is so hard for to write modern, dense, subtle  poetry about an event so
unsubtle.  I think perhaps a little jingle with sentimental rhymes would do
better for the occasion, would be more comfort to the grieving.  It seems
almost rude to write a poem about itself, about poetry, which calls
attention to its form and diction, when all the attention in this case
shouold be on the victims of the tragedy.

I liked the poem that Harriet Zinnes wrote, though.  It doesn't seem to
suffer from any of the above faults.

The only thing that makes this latest event bearable is that it seems as if
it will lead a country away from an unjust war, rather than feeding the
fires of bigoted patriotism, as "our" 911 did.

I couldn't write about 911, either, although I have my "911 poem," written
several months _before_ the evsnt, whihc was very spooky:

No Time for Sorrow

this is no time for sorrow said the window-washer,
removing the fingerprints of the man who fell
this is no time for sorrow thought the frantic stockbrokers (all in unison)
as they watched the market plummet:
one was only just recovering from a life-threatening rhinoceros attack
(acquired on a recent safari paid for by a bonus which will not recur)
this is no time for sorrow the Ayatollah said
echoed by Pat Robertson and all the members of the 700 Club
this is no time for sorrow shouted the mothers of deaf children
there will be no sorrow for the infertile couple whose goldfish died
despite having the most expensive veterinarian on the Upper East Side
(during the toilet-side memorial service they may be forgiven
for wondering if the swirling would go in the other direction in the
Southern Hemisphere)
this is no time for sorrow said the mortuary artist, the embalmer, and the
priest
this is no time to sorrow for the dead passengers of the Titanic
(their descendants may be forgiven their private mourning)
the parks will be full and the churches empty
and war-widows will go swimming to hide their tears

when it is time for sorrow the women will all gather at Columbus Circle
and some previous mayor no one is mad at any more will make a speech
and everyone will wear white
when it is time for sorrow the keening will begin on Lexington Avenue
(an ancient crone from Latvia will have been imported to teach the yuppies
how to keen)
and people in penthouse apartments will have to leave their roof-gardens to
avoid the sound
when it is time for sorrow all the children
who received 100 on their spelling tests will be publicly whipped
and grown men will feed the pigeons and crows,
shooing away the rarer songbirds
when it is time for sorrow there will be a used toilet-paper parade in lieu
of ticker tape
and people will temporarily be allowed to drop rotten tomatoes
from the observation deck of the Empire State Building
(five men will miss tucking their children in that night
as they do mandatory overtime replacing the mesh fence)
when it is time for sorrow symphonies will play only Mahler
and barbershop quartets will be outlawed
when it is time for sorrow the bereaved will rejoice and cry openly
and the neighbors who always overflow the tub into their ceiling
will join with them in their sobbing

Subject: Poems for Madrid - Nthpostion Poetry In April


Please forward a call for poems

Nthposition.com in London is calling for "poems for Madrid".  A selection
will be published online in our second-anniversary April issue, in several
weeks.  The poems will be dedicated to the people of Madrid, Spain; and
their friends and family throughout Europe; and the world.

The editors are open to a variety of responses, themes, and perspectives.
This is a fragile time caught between mourning and protest, rage and sorrow,
loss and achievement (as in the recent Spanish elections).

Europe is unsteady after its "own 9/11" - three minutes of silence today
observed across the continent.  After silence, what shall we say, what poems
will we write?

The "poems for Madrid" will follow the e-books "100 poets against the war";
"Times new roman" and "poems for Lord Hutton" as a tradition of sharing
voices, concerns, struggle, hope and art, through poetry, across the world,
in the near-instant of the Internet.

Please send the poems to: nthposition c/o todd@toddswift.com

peace.

Glad to see all this pro-Markson propaganda. The latest panel in what I
take to be a trilogy, _Vanishing Point_, is every bit as great as Reader's
Block and This Is Not etc. Wittgenstein's Nephew is probably his most
famous, and it's pretty wild. Dalkey Archive has reprinted an earlier novel
called Springer's Progress, excellent but perhaps not as thrilling a read
as the later books. Has anyone here read Markson's The Ballad of Dingus
Magee, which I take to be his first novel? He also wrote a fat book on
Malcolm Lowry of all people (and btw, don't believe those rumours of ML's
murder -- I have it on good authority that he died playing the ukelele,
possibly on the Bowery), lists three "entertainments" in his bibliography
(anyone read those?), and apparently has issued a Collected Poems. Any word
on the poems, which I've never seen?

Kevin:

Good to hear from you.  The search term to use is "urban permaculture".
  I have friends in a lot of cityscapes that are doing just that.  This
is a link to an average sort of article:

http://www.pathtofreedom.com/backtobasics/agriculture/
article_urbanpermaculture.shtml

There are much better writings, especially on the theory level, & a
tremendous amount of examples...

where's the land of dairy queen?   there are several very well known
high schools which have edible landscaping, theyre names are escaping
me right now.

Alan DeNiro posted this query on his
blog and I wrote him this letter in reply



Dear Alan,

I'm writing to you about your Phillip K. Dick
question that came up on the poetics list.
I've been obsessed with PKD as long as I
remember and very likely read most of his early
stories as they came out in the fifties as a
kid. I pride myself on my knowledge of his work,
but I am so grateful to you for raising a question
that has been in the back of my mind for years.
I have read and reread all the PDK books partly
in search for this very story. Every time I asked
my wife about it, she was sure I was thinking of UBIK.
But I knew it wasn't.

Possibly the UBIK PKD was imagining may be emerging in
the being of Google, because I simply asked it the
question, "What is the story by Phillip K. Dick in which
all of reality is turned into pieces of paper."

The answer was available here
http://www.philipkdickfans.com/frank/yves-tooj.htm

which is: "Time Out of Joint" - apparently it is the
only book of PK Dick that I have read and no longer have
in my possession- all this time thinking I had them all!

warm best wishes,
Nick Piombino

80,000 unpublished poems!!

Cid Corman, 79, Poet, Editor and Translator Who Lived in Japan, Dies
By WOLFGANG SAXON

Cid Corman, a prolific American poet, editor and translator who lived in
Japan for the last four decades, died on Friday at a hospital in Kyoto.
He was 79.

His death was reported on the Web site for English Teachers in Japan.
Richard Aaron, his archivist, said that Mr. Corman had been in a coma
since undergoing heart surgery in January.

Starting with juvenilia in the 1940's, Mr. Corman published more than
150 titles, from hardcover books to slim hand-sewn, rice-paper
selections holding 16 poems each. A sizable part of his output is
included in a series he called "of," 350-page volumes that started
appearing in 1990 (Lapis Press); a sixth and final volume is pending. In
addition, Mr. Aaron said, Mr. Corman wrote about 80,000 unpublished
poems. He said that for nearly 60 years Mr. Corman had written
constantly, both poetry and correspondence.

In 1951 Mr. Corman started Origin, a press and journal appearing at
irregular intervals and distributed by Longhouse, Publishers &
Booksellers, in Vermont. It featured fresh voices like the Black
Mountain poets and helped establish poets like Robert Creeley, Theodore
Enslin, Denise Levertov, Lorine Niedecker, Charles Olson and Philip
Whalen.

With Origin, Mr. Corman also provided an outlet for new poets from
abroad. Literate in several languages, he translated many of them
himself.

He was born Sidney Corman in Roxbury, Mass., and studied at Boston Latin
School. He graduated Phi Beta Kappa from Tufts College (now University)
in 1945 and did postgraduate work at the University of Michigan, the
University of North Carolina and, as a Fulbright scholar, at the
Sorbonne in 1954 and 1955.

His first book, "subluna," was privately printed in 1944. His first
professionally published book was "A Thanksgiving Eclogue to Theocritus"
(Sparrow, 1954). Some of his more recent works include "Just for Now"
and "The Despairs," published in 2001; "How Now" (1995); "No News"
(1992); "And the World" (1987); and "Aegis: Selected Poems, 1970-1980"
(Station Hill Press, 1983).

Mr. Corman is survived by his wife of 39 years, Shizumi Konishi.

He's certainly not the only president plagiarizing!

So far, none of my students has thought to tell me that he had failed to

Walter Lew - who is occasionally on this list - most probably knows.
If that does not work, I know Richard Barnes,the photographer - who was
married to Theresa Cha at the time of her murder. I could ask him, if you
would like. Otherwise you could call the UC Berkeley Art Museum. They did
the show of her work though I do not know if it was originated there and
whether or not they were responsible for the catalog.

Michael McClure & Jerome Rothenberg
Tuesday, March 16, 7pm
The Booksmith, 1644 Haight Street, San Francisco

Jerome Rothenberg and Michael McClure celebrate the publication of release
of Andre Breton: Selections, translated by Jerome Rothenberg, & published by
University of California Press.

Founder of the Surrealist movement, André Breton has also come to be
recognized as one of the twentieth century's most innovative and influential
poets. The inaugural volume in the Poets for the Millennium series, André
Breton offers the most comprehensive selection available in English of
Breton's poetry, along with a selection of his major prose writings. The
translations, a number of which are published here for the first time, are
by some of the most notable poets in our language, including David Antin,
Paul Auster, Samuel Beckett, Michael Benedikt, Robert Duncan, David
Gascoyne, and Charles Simic. This volume also includes an extensive
biographical and thematic introduction by Mark Polizzotti, which sets the
poems in the context of Breton's life and overall career.


Michael McClure & Jerome Rothenberg
Thursday, March 18, 7pm
City Lights Books, San Francisco

Jerome Rothenberg and Michael McClure celebrate the release of Maria Sabina:
Selections, translated by Jerome Rothenberg, & published by University of
California Press.

A shaman and visionary-not a poet in any ordinary sense-María Sabina lived
out her life in the Oaxacan mountain village of Huautla de Jiménez, and yet
her words, always sung or spoken, have carried far and wide, a principal
instance and a powerful reminder of how poetry can arise in a context far
removed from literature as such. Seeking cures through language-with the
help of Psilocybe mushrooms, said to be the source of language itself-she
was, as Henry Munn describes her, "a genius [who] emerges from the soil of
the communal, religious-therapeutic folk poetry of a native Mexican
campesino people." She may also have been, in the words of the Mexican poet
Homero Aridjis, "the greatest visionary poet in twentieth-century Latin
America."

These selections include a generous presentation from Sabina's recorded
chants and a complete English translation of her oral autobiography, her
vida, as written and arranged in her native language by her fellow Mazatec
Alvaro Estrada. Accompanying essays and poems include an introduction to
"The Life of María Sabina" by Estrada, an early description of a nighttime
"mushroom velada" by the ethnomycologist R. Gordon Wasson, an essay by Henry
Munn relating the language of Sabina's chants to those of other Mazatec
shamans, and more.

Yep, I have read all those things, except the Lowry book (which was
his thesis) but I have a copy of it. In my novel Shoot! I took two
characters of Markson's Dingus Mcgee novel and imported them to
Canada for a chapter. Ther was a movie made of that novel, which was
ridiculous because Mcgee is a teenager, and in the movie he is played
by Frank Sinatra. Well, if you forget the novel the movie can be fun.
Epitaph for a Tramp and Epitaph for a Deadbeat are straight ahead
hardboiled crime novels, in cheap little paperback editions, so
straight ahead that hey are almost parodies, great fun. I always
thought that his most famous novel was Go Down Slow, a Lowryesque
novel set in mexico. Also set in Mexico was another entertainment,
something or other Miss Doll.

"The book is subtle in many ways"

Indeed -- I just picked up a copy while in San Francisco, and it's very,
very good.  Though one part of it left me with some questions and
ambivalence.  The last several pages of the manuscript are a lucid
narrative by Spahr detailing the history of the project.  It's a
fascinating story: detailed, generous, thoughtful.  At the end though, I
felt sort of disappointed in the same way as when I read the front (or
end?) notes Jeanette Winterson wrote to her book _Gut Symmetries_.  The
other echo, though distorted, was of Elliot's notes in the Wasteland of
course.

I am disappointed because I think that the process of discovery that I
value when reading poetry has been short-circuited by the poet's
explanation.

The implication of this thought seems to be that I must accept the
narrative the poet delivers.

I've also been considering my initial reaction to the afterwords.  I
thought of the poems as being a separate entity from the afterwords, two
distinct pieces: one being art/poetry, the other being exposition/prose
without the same sort of artistic desire.

I then started thinking about how the two pieces could both be reconciled.
That this is, in fact, one complete work without distinction between the
two sections.  If so, how do the obvious contrasts comment on each other?
What do they mean in relation to a book whose very appropriate title says
it all?  "things of each possible relation hashing against one another"

It's a terrific book -- I'm sorry to be so vague in my praise, but the
thing that currently compels me about the book is my ambivalence.

So what about the explanation of poems?  Art?  Lies?  Inconsequential
because readers make up the meaning (and the text?) as they go along anyway?

Ken

The posts between Mike Magee and Louis Cabri were interesting in that Emerson
surfaced.  I happen to be reading Peter S. Field's book The Crisis of the Standing
Order: Clerical Intellectuals and Cultural Authority in Massachusetts, 1780-1833 (U
of Massachusetts Press, 1998).  In it Fields traces the mutation of
Congregationalist churches into Unitarian associations.  In the fifty year period
that Fields is working within he also notes the rapid transition from fiery ministry
to cultural authority.  The turn from God, to poetry and other arts, as a source of
standing in the community.  The wealthy bought and paid for literary ministers who
could entertain them with high wit, so that the literary ministers would in turn
tell them it was ok in a religious sense to be rich, so long as they were moral,
too.  The two groups exchanged long dinners, and toasted one another.

So in this sense the arts came to also be a buttress to the wealth of the great
families whose children attended Harvard in that it showed that they deserved their
place through the production of geniuses.  Emerson's father was a minister in one of
the most important churches in Boston.

Slowly the idea of God goes out the window, and the Boston Brahmin is born -- the
idea of the cultured individual as deserving of their place in a stratified class
society.  The idea!

Under the older Congregational arrangement the communicants (those who had earned
the right to communion) also chose the minister.  In the new churches that were
turning Unitarian those who owned their own pews chose the ministers.  Fields
comments,

"The pew proprietor arrangement under which only those who could afford to purchase
a seat were welcome precipitated a fundamental, albeit evolutionary, transformations
in Boston's Congregational churches. Predictably, pew ownership entailed a degree of
social homogeneity unimaginable a century earlier.  The encroachments of Boston's
rich elbowed the poor out of the meetinghouse and encouraged them to join the
growing Baptist and Methodist denominations" (63).

Pew levies became the source of church power which then translated into cultural
authority. You paid one hundred dollars a month for the better pews, whereas the
gallery seats might go for only twenty dollars a month.  Whole churches were bought
and paid for in this way, and there was no room for the poor to sit.  So they went
elsewhere.

In the meanwhile, Christ was downplayed as no longer divine, but merely a wise man,
and reason became exalted as the idea of absolute depravity (Lutheran as well as
Calvinist) disappears and instead the reasonableness of humanity is emphasized.  So
now I think I see the link with Marx -- reason as capable of creating a good
society.  And with that we're back to the Pelagian heresy that Augustine had to beat
down 1300 years before.

Funny how these problems keep going around.

(Note to Derek -- I hated Trungpa -- weird horrible alcoholic -- but loved Sanders'
and Clark's writings at the time about this fascist fatso -- The Party, and The
Great Naropa Poetry Wars -- very good solid sleuthing.  I was only kidding when I
wrote that bit last night -- I am against the idea that a religious person should
also be in control of the politics of a community as is so in the Tibetan church.  I
like rather the separation of church and state.)

I wasn't sure if Derek was linking Buddhism to Marxism, or whether Louis and Mike
were trying to say that Emerson was a. a Marxist, b. an answer to Marxism c., owed
something to Marxism, or just what Emerson had to do with the M. question.  I
confess that I scratched my head a bit.

I think Marx would have hated the Boston Brahmins.  I think he would have found
Trungpa to have been a completely fatuous fraudulent fink.  The Rimp, as he was
known, was the most awful human being that I have ever glimpsed.  I reject him
completely.  I hated how fat he was, I hated how stupid he was, I hated that he was
always drunk, I hated how he beat his wife, I hated how he beat his horses, and
thought his poetry was a poor excuse.  How it was that he came to help Ginsberg in
the way that the Unitarians came to help out the Boston Brahmins is worthy of
study.  Such symbiotic relationships are fascinating.  It's something like what Marx
tries to sketch out in the Grundrisse concerning the Clown as Producer of Wealth.

Oh, the social role of the poet!  It's enough to make a termite squirm!

Dear List,

CipherJournal, a new magazine focusing on creative translation and edited by
Lucas Klein, is now online at http://www.CipherJournal.com.  It contains
much that might be of interest to many of you-- so much, in fact, that I
think the Table of Contents, appended below, really speaks for itself.  But
of course I particularly want to call attention to my own small offering,
written in collaboration with Kent Johnson, which considers Jack Spicer's
_After Lorca_ in light of Walter Benjamin.

Also, I'm told that the magazine is open to submissions.

Hope you enjoy!

Mark DuCharme

I wanted to ponder the M thread a bit more but meanwhile wondered about Bly's
idea of a leaping poetry -- he was mostly thinking of images, but the ear can
also stretch between the limbic and the neocortex.

The neocortex likes, I believe, a certain regularity, and the limbic loves chaos
-- or what Nietzsche described as Apollonian versus Dionysian (quietude versus
avant?).

This is one of the things that I love in Corso -- he sets up regularity and then
does things that make his system suddenly explode with surprises.

I DREAM IN DAYTIME

I dream in daytime
  much too somber
to greet the angels
  at my velvet-shredded door

They enter salt
  they pour my milk
    the sprinkle white flies on the floor

I cringe my sink
  I gloom my stove

They leave me pink
  I dip my glove


from Elegiac Feelings American

-- I love all the delicate ways in which he rolls sounds about in that poem.
How glove rhymes so weirdly off of stove, and cringe, sink and pink go together
and yet play off of one another.  I think this is one of the great virtues of
Corso.  When poets lack this dimension, they seem less rich.  Fagin for instance
emphasized in his poetry classes that we forget sound and focus almost entirely
on image, or so I recall.  He said to run a sound check at the end.  Fagin's
poetry is rich in imagery (or was back then) and was mentally interesting, but
in terms of sound I don't remember rich strange or provocative sounds.  This is
a very important aspect of the poem to me.

I do not know how to discuss this dimension of the poem very well.  I did very
little with meter and all of that in my book on Corso as I had to focus on the
religious dimension or else the book would have lost focus.  But there is a
whole rich dimension having to do with numbers, numerology in Corso and also
having to do with meter and counting, which again has to do with whether the
world has meaning, and how.  He has a number of poems that are written directly
about or to mathematicians.  Michael Skau does more with this meter business in
his book on Corso, and takes Corso to task for being kind of a flake as a
metrist.  Corso plays with alliteration and rhyme in fascinating ways that never
quite take over the sense (as say Swinburne seems to).  I would at some point
like to take up this dimension in Corso and study it more seriously, but there
are so many other things I would like to do, too.  And no time.

I'm not sure it's the most important aspect of a poem, Chris, but I would say
that without it you're missing a whole dimension.  REgularity and surprise
should come in many dimensions in a poem that you continually want to go back
and explore.

Thanks for bringing this topic up.  I know the thread died out or something, but
I've been tied up.  I wish Annie Finch would talk about regularity versus
surprise and comment on the Corso poem above.  She might hate it.  Maybe it's
too simple or something.  I did a few pages on the religious aspects of the poem
above in my book, but barely touched upon meter.  That's another whole book, and
I'm not always sure of my ear.  Corso had such a weird high voice.  Does anybody
remember it?  He came off as a tough thug, but his voice was extremely high,
like a batty old woman's screeching most of the time.  I found him so comical.
Nothing fit.  The only other person who has a voice like Corso's is the great
poetry critic Charles Altieri.  Their voices are almost identical.  They are
both Italian American New Yorkers, and those are the only two of that group that
I know, so maybe it is more common than I think.  But if Corso was to read the
poem above, it would sound very different than how I'd read it with my
midwestern flat voice.

How many now have died

Post Script: Lincoln hated war, yet he mocked no warriors.  Above all =
else, he knew that even in the futility of war there existed the =
potential for the value of progress for peace for all mankind.  The =
irony may be too much for some to comprehend, but the truth of the =
matter is that citizens of today's world owe much of their freedom to =
the deaths of many who fought before them, for them.  Funny, too, is the =

Thanks to many for the good leads (and anecdotes) for Cha.  Thinking
of Corman too, I guess this sense of a footprint after someone has
gone is as good an indication as any of the existence of "community."

Dear all,

A student of ours has asked for the kind participation of the
coglingers. A
few minutes you could spare in filling the enquiry will be of great help
for the future of his research. Generally speaking, it is about finding
systematic ways of restating the same sentence.

Thanks very much

Hi,

I am doing some research on Natural Language, and that includes a survey
to know what people think about different forms of expressing one idea.
I've prepared an online enquiry, and I'd appreciate if you could respond
to
it.
It consists of 20 sentences expressed in 4 different ways, and should
take
you 15-25 minutes to finish.
To respond, please visit: http://galaxia-alfa.com/enquiry
If you know someone who would like to help, please pass the word. This
enquiry is very important for my research, and for the results to be
valid
it's necessary to have a good number of responses.
Thank you very much for your cooperation.
Mateus Mendes

 16 March:


U.S. Unloading WMD in Iraq

TEHRAN (Mehr News Agency)

Over the past few days, in the wake of the bombings in Karbala and the
ideological disputes that delayed the signing of Iraq's interim
constitution, there have been reports that U.S. forces have unloaded a large
cargo of parts for constructing long-range missiles and weapons of mass
destruction (WMD) in the southern ports of Iraq.  A reliable source from the
Iraqi Governing Council, speaking on condition of anonymity, told the Mehr
News Agency that U.S. forces, with the help of British forces stationed in
southern Iraq, had made extensive efforts to conceal their actions.  He
added that the cargo was unloaded during the night as attention was still
focused on the aftermath of the deadly bombings in Karbala and the signing
of Iraq's interim constitution.

The source said that in order to avoid suspicion, ordinary cargo ships
were used to download the cargo, which consisted of weapons produced in the
1980s and 1990s.He mentioned the fact that the United States had
facilitated Iraq's WMD program during the 1980-1988 Iran-Iraq and said that
some of the weapons being downloaded are similar to those weapons, although
international inspectors had announced Saddam Hussein's Baath regime had
destroyed all its WMD.

The source went on to say that the rest of the weapons were probably
transferred in vans to an unknown location somewhere in the vicinity of
Basra overnight. Most of these weapons are of Eastern European origin and
some parts are from the former Soviet Union and the Eastern Bloc. The U.S.
obtained them through confiscations during sales of banned arms over the
past two decades, he said.  This action comes as certain U.S. and Western
officials have been pointing out the fact that no weapons of mass
destruction have been discovered in Iraq and the issue of Saddam's trial
begins to take center stage. In addition, formerchief UN weapons inspector
Hans Blix has emphasized that the U.S. And British intelligence agencies
issued false reports on Iraq leading to the U.S. attack.

Meanwhile, the suspicious death of weapons inspector David Kelly is also an
unresolved issue in Britain.------Occupation Forces Official Claims to Have
No Information About Transfer of WMD to Iraq -------A security official for
the coalition forces in Iraq said that he has not received any information
about the unloading of weapons of mass destruction in ports in southern
Iraq.  ShaneWolf told the Mehr News Agency that the occupation forces have
received no reports on such events, but said he hoped that the coalition
forces would find the Iraqi weapons of mass destruction one day.  Coalition
forces and inspectors have so far been unable to find any Iraqi weapons of
mass destruction.

The U.S. invaded Iraq under the pretext that Iraq possessed a stockpile of
weapons of mass destruction.  Now they are planting the evidence.

New Brutalism Reading Series Presents:
Elizabeth Treadwell
&
Yedda Morrison

Sunday, March 21st
@ 21 Grand
449B 23rd St.
Oakland, Ca 94612
7-9pm
$4

Come help celebrate the realease of Elizabeth
Treadwell’s two new books: 2004: Chantry, from Chax
Press, and LILYFOIL + 3, from O Books.  Her new
work floats gracefully between neologism
(“abbychoosy”) and typographical flexibility—a row of
words at the bottom of a page, a whole page with a
single line.  Treadwell’s previous books include a
novel, several chapbooks, and a collection of prose
poems, Populace (Avec, 1999). Her essay, "Secret Mint:
an exposition," will appear in Writing Under the
Influence: America¹s New Women Poets & The Generation
That Inspires Them(Wesleyan, due 2005).  Treadwell was
born in Oakland, California, in 1967 and lives there
now with her husband and baby daughter. Since 2000,
she has served as director of Small Press Traffic
Literary Arts Center at CCA, San Francisco.

Yedda Morrison’s new work “Crop” explores the
functions of the fractured female text, alliterating
like “to sails by her vinyl / pinned itinerant /
Bride in literate” but also literaly uses the poems as
a project to explores the conditions of being a
laborer at a pear packing farm, and researching on
“the degree of negligence” on the part of an aerospace
company.  Morrison’s books include, The Marriage of
the Well Built Head (Double Lucy Press, 1998), Shed (A
+ Bend Press, 2000), and Crop (Kelsey Street Press,
2003). She teaches creative writing in San Francisco’s
Tenderloin district and works at a flower shop. Yedda
is currently working on a multimedia project titled
Girl Scout Nation. She lives in Oakland, CA.

Sirkka-Liisa -- my mother in law's name is Sirkka-Liisa.  Ok, can you
name a joy that Luther killed, or a joy that Trungpa provided?

Sometimes you have to separate joy from laughter.  I do remember that
Luther said we should not laugh and sing at the same time.  Perhaps you
are referring to that.

"Music doesn't sound right when there is laughter in connection with it,
for music is intended to cheer the spirit.  The mouth gets no pleasure
from it.  If one sings diligently, the soul, which is located in the
body, plays and derives special pleasure from it."  This Martin Luther
said when we laughed during the singing at table.

Table Talks p. 420

Other than this, I can't think of any joys that Martin killed.  Even in
this he isn't trying to kill joy, but rather to preserve a higher joy
from a milder pleasure.  Perhaps you have some other saying of brother
Martin's to which you are referring?

Best, Kirby

October 31, 1976
The Merwin incident
During Trungpa, Rinpoche's 1976 seminary near Snowmass, Colorado, poet
W.S. Merwin and companion Dana Naone are noted absent from a naked
Halloween party. When located they refuse to join in, at which time
Trungpa directs several people to break into their barricaded room and
drag the reluctant pair to the gathering. An argument follows and they
are forcibly stripped of their clothing.

The incident - which Trungpa characterizes as merely another teaching -
becomes public three years later when Allen's interview with Tom Clark
is published in the Boulder Monthly. The fiasco haunts Naropa for
several years, setting off the "poetry wars," severing numerous
friendships and drawing public criticism.

I am aware that certain incidents rubbed certain people the wrong way
according to their moral sensibilities and there was a lot of
'recountings,' fictional or otherwise, after-the-fact, and maybe even a
lot of apologizing and hand-holding went on regarding certain incidents
within social networks which included many influential poets --
nevertheless -- a moment of tension and/or drama was being publicized,
produced, advertised, and distributed - all speaking about the fat dumb
buddhist.


if i could go back in time to the late cocaine-70s and had good drugs
and shelter and lived a Sagittarian-like existence with many of the
day's best poets...  i dunno... it seems to me all this material
gathered around relating to the publication of "Speaking about the fat
dumb buddhist..." is a *backlash* activity. My understanding of this
stuff is that it was rejected by Rolling Stone Magazine for being a poor
excuse when it came down to real 'investigation' (or maybe Rolling Stone
just preferred their own weird horrible drunk - H.S.T.) and much of the
many accounts of one single incident is admittedly 'highly
fictionalized.'

So what does that mean? It means whomever never got to cash-in on
rubbing it in Trungpa's face and projecting their 'self' toward new
horizons in opposition to him personally. Whatever. This appears to be
back-sliding activity.

I can't imagine anything easier in this world than beating up on a
buddhist. I should think it would be possible to go into business doing
this (a life's work?). So until someone somewhere wants to stand up and
share what they *know* and not what they *heard* I appreciate the
difference between 'belief' and 'knowledge'. I don't know any buddhist
who goes around defending and protecting their self-image. Whatever
credentials you believe Trungpa was missing I think you missed the
point.

I missed this but who was saying that it was wrong to beat up a buddhist? It
would seem to me wrong to beat up anybody unless they had it coming. and if
they did have it coming how could we be sure? It's really a matter of
interpretation, and a very bad idea to let ego get involved. Michael

Trungpa wasn't dumb.  He attended the highest level British universities,
knew a number of languages, and so on.  This incident was described in an
edited compilation by Ed Sanders called The Party.  I don't know if it's
still around or in print, but I was at Naropa in 77 and 79.  I think it
clarified a lot of issues regarding democracy and Buddhism (no connection,
as Tom Clark pointed out quite often).  You either submit to the guru, or
you're out.  Tom Clark's book The Great Naropa Poetry Wars is still around.
The incident is somewhat arcane, but in terms of poetry circles almost
everybody weighed in -- it was a major incident.  For me, it clarified the
need to return to Democratic sources, and to journalism, and so on.  I think
it clarified this need for poets such as Clark, Dorn, Sanders, and others,
too.  Even Codrescu.

The Buddhist deal is very nice in some ways (I liked sitting, and so on, in
the very clear air of summer Boulder).

Trungpa wasn't a retard that you could kick around.  He was a millionaire
who owned a huge house, lots of cars, had bodyguards with machine guns, and
went around in Rolls Royces.  I was there and saw a lot of this.  The PArty,
edited by Sanders, is probably around still.  It's a great book on this
incident.  It documents actual conversations with actual Buddhists who saw
what took place -- this was at a remote retreat.  It's an extremely ugly
encounter that gives you pause when considering Trungpa.

I was hoping to discuss Emerson more, too.  I couldn't understand the last
two posts by Louis and Mike -- they seemed to deliberately obfuscate the
issue.  Too bad.

In the Peter Field book he argues that the Boston Brahmin notion of culture
ended up being something for the extreme upper classes that deliberately
left the poor on the cutting room floor.  "In short, the Brahmin clergy of
Boston had transformed God's covenant with the Puritan nation into a class
compact with a privileged elite" (110).

My real strengths are in French literature and philosophy, but I am trying
to understand more about the American situation -- so complicated, so
various.  Lutherans have had very little say in American literature, so I am
constantly having to leave and try to understand other groups, and their
backgrounds.

Even Gary Snyder and Robert Bly were disgusted by Trungpa -- in spite of
their own strong Buddhist connection.  I don't know if Joanne Kyger remarked
on Trungpa.  She is usually, it seems, more diplomatic.  What was her take?
Does anybody know?

I shudder to think of some of the atrocious things that have happened at
Naropa.  In the mid-80s there was the Osel Tenzin incident -- I think that
was his name.  He ordered his disciples to sleep with him although he didn't
tell them he had AIDS.  This resulted in HIV infections for several people.
This was another mess.  The strong hierarchy of Buddhism -- in many ways it
is as bad as incidents within the Catholic church that we've been watching
in the headlines over the last five years.

Some 7% of the Boston diocese is under indictment.

There is even a Lutheran pastor -- I think in Lubbock, Texas -- who has been
sued for 5 million dollars for fucking his flock.  That's our only case so
far, but that one case is going to cost plenty.  Already the insurance
carrier has cancelled the insurance for that church.

Religion is very scary -- it has so much cultural power -- and where it goes
wrong -- there's hell to pay.  Since we can't seem to get away from religion
in one guise or another -- it pays to think it through as seriously as
possible.

-- Kirby

Derek -- your account below is a very sanitized version of what actually
took place.  There were 600 stitches involved, for instance.  The forcible
stripping would rub most people the wrong way, it would seem to me -- as
well as the vicious statements that Trungpa then directed at Merwin and his
humiliated girlfriend.

There's an excellent book on the general subject: "The Guru Papers: Masks of
Authoritarian Power," by Joel Kramer and Diana Alstad. The title is a bit
unfortunate, probably chosen to appeal to a popular audience. The authors
are first rate scholars.

publication of Richard Sonn=92s Anarchism and Cultural Politics in
Fin-de-Si=E8cle France (1989) and David Weir=92s Anarchy and Culture
(1995).  What once might have seemed a curiosity now appears to have
been central to the development of literary aesthetics: from the
Pre-Raphaelites to the Symbolists, from the Expressionists to the Dadas,

and from Pound=92s Vorticism to the Black Mountain poets, modernism is
marked by anarchist struggles.

This panel is an open invitation for papers that explore this
conjunction between the aesthetic and the political.  Possible topics
include, but are not restricted to:

The influence of anarchism on specific authors or literary works
Literary works by anarchists and their political fellow-travellers
(e.g., Ba Jin, Hugo Ball, Kenneth Rexroth, Louise Michel)
The symbolic role of =93anarchist=94 characters in literary works
Anarchist critiques of representation and literary/cultural struggles
Literature that bears witness to moments in anarchist history =96 e.g.,
the Spanish Civil War, Sacco and Vanzetti, the Lawrence    strike
Anarchist aesthetics as part of labor culture (e.g., the Wobblies, the
CNT)
Saint Louis=92s anarcho-literary connections (e.g., Magon=92s newspaper
Regeneracion, Emma Goldman=92s speeches, the anarchic =93Reign of the
Rabble=94 in the 1877 Railroad Strike)
What makes a literary text =93anarchist=94?
Literary criticism by anarchists (e.g., Emma Goldman, Voltairine de
Cleyre, Dora Marsden, Herbert Read, Paul Goodman): how does ideology
inform interpretation?
What is anarchist literary theory?
What=92s next for anarchist studies in the discipline of English?

For Immediate Release - Please forward

Seven Poets Gather to Celebrate 90th Anniversary of Imagism in London

A group of young poets of international renown are gathering to celebrate
new ways of seeing, and saying, in a witty, provocative, sometimes erotic,
and often cosmopolitan gathering, ninety years after the birth of Imagism.
This is a playful homage to the Pound Era.

Featured readers will be: John Stammers (Panoramic Lounge-bar, Picador);
Clare Pollard (Bedtime, Bloodaxe ); Antony Dunn (Flying Fish,
Carcanet/Oxford Poets); Sarah Corbett (The Witch Bag, Seren);
performance-writer Caroline Bergvall; Todd Swift (www.toddswift.com) and
Budapest-based David Hill (www.lyriklife.com).

All the poets are experienced and provocative performers of their work; and
respected/award-winning published authors.  Each, in their own way, works
with a keen awareness of visual media, or imagery, in relation to language,
and the page.  A scintillating afternoon of poetry, wine, good humour, and
broken icons, awaits.

***

The Salon des Arts http://www.salondesarts.org/main.htm welcomes you to a
special Sunday afternoon (April 18, 3-6) reading/cocktail party, on the
subject of The New Image - 90 Years after Des Imagistes.  It was in London,
in 1914, that famed poet-impresario Ezra Pound edited the Des Imagistes
anthology.  Poets subsequently influenced by this movement include T S
Eliot, William Carlos Williams, Wallace Stevens, and Marianne Moore. Now, in
the 21st century, the image means so much more, and less - relating to the
camera eye, the cinematic gaze, and the internet panopticon.

David Hill and Todd Swift are poet-impressarios whose work together includes
hosting the infamous Tea and Sympathy cabarets in Budapest, which led to the
Bardroom series.  Swift was recently compared to Ezra Pound in The Chronicle
of Higher Education for his poetry projects.  Hill is a poet who combines
humour, panache and sheer gall to achieve side-splitting effects.  Together
Hill and Swift form a picture (if not pitch) perfect emcee duo.

Kirby, I've caught just enough of your schtik on this List to know that I don't
want to get into a drawn out argument with you.  But I did want to briefly
respond to what I read as a trite "guilt by association and implication" spin
at the beginning of your post:

"The posts between Mike Magee and Louis Cabri were interesting in that Emerson
surfaced.  I happen to be reading Peter S. Field's book The Crisis of the
Standing Order: Clerical Intellectuals and Cultural Authority in Massachusetts,
1780-1833 (U of Massachusetts Press, 1998).  In it Fields traces the mutation
of Congregationalist churches into Unitarian associations.  In the fifty year
period that Fields is working within he also notes the rapid transition from
fiery ministry to cultural authority.  The turn from God, to poetry and other
arts, as a source of standing in the community.  The wealthy bought and paid
for literary ministers who could entertain them with high wit, so that the
literary ministers would in turn tell them it was ok in a religious sense to be
rich, so long as they were moral, too.  The two groups exchanged long dinners,
and toasted one another. So in this sense the arts came to also be a buttress
to the wealth of the great families whose children attended Harvard in that it
showed that they deserved their place through the production of geniuses.
Emerson's father was a minister in one of the most important churches in
Boston."

Nevermind that the "turn from God" as it relates to class is infinitely more
complex than the above suggests -- I'll have to wait till I read Field's book
to know whether he's represented acurately here.  My point is simply that what
you seem to be implying about Emerson's own trajectory vis a vis his father and
Unitarianism is dead wrong.  For starters, Emerson himself leaves the ministry
in 1832 over a theological dispute.  He is also banned from Harvard after
delivering his "Divinity School Address" (1837), a ban which remains in place
until 1872.  During this time he throws himself headlong into abolitionism and,
yes, does some of the most important thinking/writing ever on the relationship
between the social and the aesthetic.

My suspicion is that your wanting to talk about "Boston Brahmins" has more to do
with some agenda involving John Kerry than it does Emerson.  So be it.  But I
would encourage you and anyone else on this list interested in the back & forth
between Louis and I to check out both Robert Richardson's incredibly well
researched and written biography "Emerson: The Mind on Fire" as well as Len
Gougeon's "Virtue's Hero: Emerson, Anti-Slavery and Reform." Emerson, we know,
read Marx's article "Forced Emigration" in 1853 and it informed the section of
_English Traits_ called "Wealth."  Obviously this is a very comlicated topic --
Emerson and Marx are by no means identical in any facet of their thought.  In
my discussion w/ Louis I was only trying to talk briefly about the concept of
"symbolic action" and it's origins in Emerson's anti-slavery writings.  My own
book, "Emancipating Pragmatism: Emerson, Jazz and Experimental Writing" will be
out from U Alabama in a couple weeks.

Peace,

-m.

Mark,
I'd say that Luther wouldn't want a cult of personality at all.  Whereas
Trungpa was born as a divine figure -- when he was born, milk buckets and
rainbows supposedly filled the sky.

Luther just had, to my mind, an extraordinarily clear sense of what is
valuable in life.  His anti-semitism is disgraceful, for instance, and most
Lutheran scholars (most of the rank and file don't know about it -- it's only
fifty pages or so out of five bookshelves of lectures and writings) -- most
Lutherans know that it's disgraceful.  So we don't see Luther as a deity.  We
see him rather as a troubled guy with a very sharp clear mind that made
Christianity comprehensible.

I'd see him as more of a philosopher.  The Lutheran line of philosophers such
as Soren Kierkegaard -- they don't tell you what to think, but they ask you
to do it for yourself, and show you some of the ropes, and then you're on
your own.  When Kierkegaard talks for example about how "existence precedes
essence" -- a line picked up by Simone de Beauvoir and Sartre -- he's saying
that we are not race, gender or class, but are individuals faced with our own
solitude (Bataille and co. were a lot more influenced by Kierkegaard than
they were willing to let on when they wrote of solitude) and that our value
choices are our own active judgements (compare Marx who seems to claim that
classes think alike due to material circumstances, or compare Hegel who
thinks that we are merely some aspect of a universal history marching through
time).  Kierkegaard emphasizes that we are each alone with life, and must
make our own choices.  In a sense, he's against the trivialization of matters
of judgement -- this is why Simone de Beauvoir got so much out of her link
with Kierkegaard -- a woman is NOT a woman so much as she is a being whose
soul/mind precedes her biological condition.  Most feminists don't know
Kierkegaard so they are blind to what SdB was actually saying, and how this
existentialism drove the 50s left in France, and influenced many of the
Beats.  SdB is actually arguing for the individual's ability to think in
history.  This comes out of Kierkegaard.

Unfortunately, the link to Kierkegaard was not well understood, and
Kierkegaard's link to the Lutheran tradition even less well-understood.  But
the idea is that we stand alone before God.  Our relation is personal, and is
not to be mediated by the Pope, whom Luther considered the anti-Christ.  I'm
sure he would consider Trungpa as another aspect of the anti-Christ precisely
because he attempted to break down the individual sense of judgement in
matters of ethics and religion and even aesthetics and subordinate it to his
own evil intentions.  If you read Sanders' The Party, you will see what I
mean by evil intentions.  My jaw hit the floor.

Ginsberg unfortunately left his early existentialist roots later on and went
closer to Trungpa's sphere of influence, and his poetry and his ethics and
everything else about him seems to have gone downhill.

Harry Nudel's revelation of Ginsberg's sexual predatory aspect (as well as
his well-known support of NAMBLA) is not so much infantile as it is an
attempt to prey on the young.  He set up the school in order to prey on
kids.  It's horrifying.

Luther on the other hand is asking us to become adults, and all of his work
was dedicated in that direction.  That's why he developed a living tradition
which is completely antithetical to the guru tradition of the
passivity-producing Buddhists.

Kierkegaard's Either/Or -- the active taking of choices -- and how we are
responsible for those -- can help to make this clear -- but it's not a very
easy philosophy or even denomination to really understand.  It's an
intellectual tradition (Luther was a brilliant academic) -- and perhaps even
rivals the great Jewish tradition in creating some of the most outstanding
works through which a human being can become a strong, functioning individual
in a strong, functioning community.

What happened in the 70s was this upsurge of guru-dom in which people
surrendered their brains in exchange for peace.

Maybe the worst was this Rajneeshi group in Oregon, but the remnants of those
groups have never really come back.  They are as shattered as the young men
who fought in Vietnam.

People hunger for religion (meaning).  As the orthodox churches lost some of
their standing in the 70s, many turned to gurus and to universal plans for
peace.  They surrended their brains in the process.  We need to reconnect to
older traditions, and to evaluate them, and get back on the right track, in
my view.

But, then, I am a killjoy!  But I think Sirkka-Liisa doesn't really define
joy very well.  Yes, I think it is important to avoid mere pleasures that
will cripple or kill you and to think about what is genuine joy.  Service to
others is a real joy, while preying on others is a sick pleasure, for
example.

Subject: Save the Sierra Club from Hostile Takeover

Dear MoveOn member,

Are you a Sierra Club member?

The future of the Sierra Club is at stake.

Outsiders are trying to take over the Club by placing stealth
candidates on the Club's board ballot this year.  This is driven
by anti-immigration activists, and their tactics are underhanded --
they aren't declaring their real issue positions to members.
They hope that low participation and confusion will allow them
to stack the board of directors.

You can stop this, but you must vote now in the Sierra Club board
election.  You probably have already received the ballot in the mail.

We've attached below an outreach from Groundswell Sierra -- a
volunteer network of Sierra Club members working to defeat this
threat.  This outreach includes a list of endorsed candidates.
We recommending printing this email and having it on hand as you
fill out your ballot.

If you'd like more information on this threat, go to:

http://www.groundswellsierra.org/takeover_index.php

Thank you,

-Carrie, Joan, Noah, Peter, and Wes
 The MoveOn.org team
 Tuesday, March 18th, 2004

P.S.  You won't be hearing from the Sierra Club directly about
this underhanded maneuver by anti-immigration activists.  Sierra Club
staff cannot speak out about board elections.  It's up to us.

You can review an article on this attempted takeover by former
Sierra Club President, Adam Werbach, at:

  Hostile Takeover
  Anti-immigration coalition seeks control of Sierra Club
  By Adam Werbach | 3.9.04
  http://inthesetimes.com/comments.php?id=644_0_2_0_M

  Key excerpt:

  "In 1998 the membership voted overwhelmingly to stay out of the
  (immigration) issue, restating that the most effective way to deal
  with the impact of population on the planet is to reduce levels
  of American waste and to raise the global status of women."

P.P.S.  You can vote on line, but only with your paper ballot
in hand.  For more information:

ACTION ALERT FROM GROUNDSWELL SIERRA:

   The Sierra Club has been targeted for a hostile takeover by
anti-immigration, animal rights and other groups who are running
petition candidates with no Sierra Club experience for the Board
of Directors. Don't take our word for it: The Los Angeles Times,
Santa Fe New Mexican, Denver Post, and Philadelphia Inquirer
have all warned that the threat is serious. That's why Groundswell
Sierra - a diverse group of Sierra Club volunteers who are working
to defend the Sierra Club - is asking you to support five Nominating
Committee-recommended candidates who have over 75 years of
collective experience as Sierra Club grassroots activists and will
put their loyalty to the Sierra Club above their personal agendas:

NICK AUMEN, Everglades restoration scientist and former
        Sierra Club Treasurer and Vice President for Conservation.


DAVE KARPF, Recent Director of Sierra Student Coalition,
        and Chair of the Sierra Club's Training and national EPEC
        field programs.


JAN O'CONNELL, Sierra Club Treasurer, former Vice
        President for Organizational Effectiveness, fundraiser in
        the Sierra Club's beat-Bush effort.


SANJAY RANCHOD, delegate to the U.N. Kyoto global
        warming negotiations and Chair of the Sierra Club's
        Sustainable Planet Strategy Team.


LISA RENSTROM, leader of the Harvard project to
        strengthen the Sierra Club's groups and chapters, former
        Director, former Foundation Trustee, and former Chair of
        the Sierra Club's fundraising efforts.

Nick, Dave, Jan, Sanjay, and Lisa have brought experience and
dedicated leadership to the Sierra Club. They have led our
conservation priority campaigns, the Sierra Club's EPEC program,
help strengthen the Sierra Club's financial health, run the Sierra
Student Coalition, and represented the Sierra Club at UN conferences
on the Kyoto accord on global warming. (For information on these
candidates, go to our website, http://www.groundswellsierra.org )

    At a time when the Sierra Club's own democratic process is being
used against us, when our agenda and assets are targeted for takeover
by outsiders, we are giving Nick, Dave, Jan, Sanjay, and Lisa our
unqualified support. These are trusted leaders who have shown that
they value the Club's mission and grassroots culture, and who believe
only a united and strong Sierra Club can stop George Bush's assaults
on our air, water, wild lands and wildlife.

    Finally, we would be remiss if did not acknowledge the invaluable
contributions former Board Directors Chad Hanson, Michael Dorsey
and Ed Dobson have made to the Sierra Club's conservation work,
and we wish them well in this election.

    Please share this email with as many of your friends and other
Sierra Club members as you can. Urge them to visit our website
( http://www.groundswellsierra.org ),
and when their ballots arrive in early March, please VOTE!

    There's a lot at stake. The following quotes explain why.

    "We're only three directors away from controlling the board.
And, once we get three more directors elected...[We'll] change the
entire agenda of that organization."
    -- Paul Watson, Sierra Club Director and animal rights activist
       at the center of the take over effort.

    "If they succeed. Our integrity, our credibility and our
reputation will be severely damaged and we will be rendered less
effective on all the issues our members care about."
    -- Ross Vincent, long time Sierra Club activist.

    "Fighting over immigration policy nearly destroyed the Sierra
Club's effectiveness once; it cannot be allowed to happen again by
electing people to the board whose purpose is to overthrow its
established policies. We should not be battling each other when
our main task must be to end the worst administration in the history
of our nation."
    -- Paul Ehrlich, Bing Professor of Population Studies,
       Stanford University

    "Sierra Club has an essential role and voice in the debate over
the health of our environment. It is crucial that this voice and
leadership are maintained and strengthened during these
challenging times."
    --Carol Browner, Chair of National Audubon Society, former
       EPA Administrator, 1993-2001.

    "Now more than ever we need a strong Sierra Club. With the
Bush administration's assault on the environment, we need directors
who care about its 112- year mission. Please support these five
nominated candidates."
    --Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., Environmentalist and NRDC
       Board Member

Mike, I don't know very much at all about Emerson.  I'm doing research on the
influence of Unitarians at Harvard for part of a larger project (I don't know if it
will be completed) and that's why I am reading the Peter S. Field book The Crisis of
the Standing Order.  I think I read The essay on Self-Reliance by Emerson, but don't
know much else.  I valued your paragraph below -- this is the sort of meat I was
asking for.  I am actually pretty harmless, honestly.

As for Kerry, I thought that he went to Yale, and was raised as a Catholic.  He's
Irish.  So, he doesn't seem to me to fit this conversation, but I am also interested
in how he might.

Edwards clearly has stated that he is a big fan of the arts.  Kerry, as with most
things, is winning by keeping his head down and trying to appeal to everybody.

I don't know much about him or his background aside from a few demographic details.
Could he be said to in any sense be a Boston Brahmin?  The Brahmins, according to
the Field book, came out of the old Congregational background, and slowly turned
toward the arts rather than to theology as a source of power.  When they effectively
take over Harvard with the election of Henry Ware as Hollis Professor, Harvard
changes over within fifteen years to an almost completely secular institution, and
begins to produce literary people, rather than ministers.

"The real revolution in the Brahmin transformation of Harvard, as well as in
Boston's churches, was their conscious movement from strictly theological concerns
toward literary, high-cultural preoccupations" (125-126).

This isn't an area or a period about which I know very much.  But it sounds to me as
if Emerson's turn away from the church is part of the very movement that Field is
painting.  Peter Quartermain alluded to Emerson's removal from HArvard in a
backchannel post a few months back.  I've been mired most of my life in minor
questions to do with surrealism.  I'm only now really trying to understand some of
the conflicts in American intellectual life.  So your post was a big part of the
puzzle for me.  Unfortunately I'm rather isolated and am stumbling through a lot of
this.

The only time I get very testy is when I run into what I consider to be too little
willingness to think through a whole tangle of problems and to try to forestall
conversation.  I want to read your book, but am too dumb in this area to review it,
so will have to wait til the price goes down.  I wish you'd spell out more about the
link as you see it between Marx and Emerson, but maybe you've done that in your
book, and don't want to deal with it any further here.  I'd like to know how you
think they go together, and ways they might not.  I'm also interested to know how
Emerson supported himself if he dropped out of the ministry and also wasn't working
at Harvard.  I seem to remember that he had a large enough estate that he was able
to help out Thoreau.  But I can do this research myself by finding a quick biography
somewhere on the web or I can get the biographies you mention below.  I only want a
thumbnail sketch though because I am actually researching another area and don't
have time to read large things not having directly to do with the topics of urbanism
that I am trying to understand.  I hope your book does well.  Academic books are
doing less and less well, it seems.  Perhaps at least this exchange has allowed you
to advertize your book, and maybe someone on the board will review it for you.  This
happened to me on my Corso book!

There's been a "oh...lordy-lord!" mention here recently of poetry's "social
role," as if the social were poetry's robes, poet puts on "the robes," goes
walking, talking, essaying, scolding, lecturing, preaching.... Olson's out
again at 1 a.m., on the Cut's bridge, facing down a police cruiser,
measuring his verse against the tides before him, as well as the clock
timing through him.... Me likes it! (Impossible likeness!) But, does not
confining the social to robes' roles (rote rituals, or "ordinary"
animadversions) confine the social's appearance in poetry to representations
of agency ("symbolic actions" on a Burkean stage)? It's not a new question
by any stretch, and to it there's no straight answer worth its Alt button
attitude. I address a particular conflation of "social" and "role," in the
upcoming XCP essay ("role" as socialist realism; "social" as command), which
still seems to apply (as the recent use of "social role" suggests). I only
have hunches about where R. Waldo is (the social's cognate "society" is
_versus_ a transcendental pragmatism, as conformism is versus self-reliance,
but with complications keeping this messy and interesting)...regrettably my
own hand in disabusing myself of these hunches must be played another time.
I am looking forward to reading Mike's book for any insights into the term's
usages and contexts, as no doubt many others will want to read his book for
all sorts of other compelling reasons, too. But, meanwhile...think of
Socrates's oracle that forbids but does not command. Now think of it
reversed and skewed: "oracle" that commands and does not forbid. Sounds -
appalling. But, it does not sound. For think of this new oracle
constituting, constitutive of, an empty injunction (ie, there is no specific
message in the command to obey and act upon). There you have a finition, as
opposed to a de-finition, of the social.

All best, Louis

NYT March 17, 2004
Ah, Poetic Injustice! Seeking a Laureate, Queens Goes Blank
By ROBERT F. WORTH


Hal Sirowitz is one of those rare New York writers who is willing =E2=80=94=20=
eager,=20
in fact =E2=80=94 to identify himself with the borough of Queens. A tall man=
 with a=20
shambling gait, scraggly beard and thick glasses, he has made a career of=20
turning outer-borough alienation into deadpan humor.

But lately Mr. Sirowitz has been growing nervous. He finished his term as=20
the official poet laureate of Queens in December, and ever since, a=20
committee of Queens librarians and professors has been struggling to find=20
his replacement. The winner must be someone who has lived in Queens for at=20
least five years and has written, in English, "poetry inspired by the=20
borough."

The committee has not found anyone.

So far the search has yielded only a handful of poems about traffic safety,=20
airports and domestic abuse. The deadline has been extended twice now, from=20
December to January to April.

"Queens is the forgotten borough," said Mr. Sirowitz, a little wistfully.

It is not that Queens lacks poets. There have been two poet laureates since=20
the former borough president, Claire Shulman, borrowed the title, with its=20
wild civic aspirations, from Brooklyn.

But Brooklyn has been awash in would-be laureates ever since Walt Whitman=20
walked its streets. Countless poets have written odes to the towers and=20
tenements of Manhattan, and the Bronx and Staten Island have inspired their=20
share of verse, though none of these boroughs bestow laureate crowns.

The muse has been less kind to Queens. In "Poems of New York," an anthology=20
published by Everyman's Library in 2002, there are dozens of poems about=20
the other four boroughs. Not one poem is set in Queens.

Even the borough's vast population of immigrants has not been able to=20
rescue it for poetry. In "Bridge and Tunnel," Sarah Jones's current=20
Off-Broadway play, she impersonates a series of immigrants performing at a=20
poetry slam in south Queens. But the real poets of Queens are more like Mu=20
Xin, a 78-year-old Chinese exile who moved here after being imprisoned=20
during the Cultural Revolution. He does not write, or even speak, English.=20
And he has never written a word about Queens.

It should be said that the position of poet laureate is not necessarily an=20
exalted one. Few Queens residents seem to know it exists, and it comes with=20
no salary or office space.

So far, nine would-be laureates have submitted work, with titles like=20
"Christmas Week Depression," "Domestic Violence," and "I Read My Poems to=20
My Dog." One poem, titled simply "Queens," includes the lines: "There are=20
five colleges/Traveling is easier/Living near two airports." Another is=20
about traffic deaths on Queens Boulevard: "Traffic lights heretofore=20
largely ignored/Receive more respect from jaywalkers."

After receiving his title from Mrs. Shulman in 2000, Mr. Sirowitz, now 55,=20
spent three years giving readings throughout the city and even touring the=20
country.

He has lived in the borough for 25 years, and can lose patience with=20
outsiders' snotty views of it. One prose poem, titled "In Defense of=20
Queens," ends like this:

"So listen up you people of Manhattan.

You need us to keep your streets less crowded. We don't need you."'

But much of the time Mr. Sirowitz prefers to flaunt his sense of regional=20
humiliation. Joey Ramone, a Queens poet in his own way, did something of=20
the kind in 1977 when he first belted out the words of "We're a Happy=20
Family":

"Sitting here in Queens, eating refried beans ...

No Christmas cards to send, Daddy likes men,

Daddy's telling lies, baby's eating flies."

There is, of course, another way to be a Queens poet laureate. Stephen=20
Stepanchev, who was the first to assume the title in 1997, is a retired=20
English professor who has published in The New Yorker and other respected=20
venues, and has produced 10 volumes of verse. His quietly lyrical poems are=20
often set in Queens parks, and dwell on the borough's harmonious ethnic=20
diversity. In one poem, "Sunday in the Queens Botanical Garden," he begins:

"The Easter egg babushkas of the Slavs

Talk in color with the turbans of Pakistan,

Tulip red and yellow."

But even Mr. Stepanchev, who lived and worked in Queens for four decades,=20
admits that his gentle devotion to the borough is not widely shared. New=20
York City may be a magnet for writers and artists, but few of them have=20
ever spent much time in Queens.

Jack Kerouac lived in his mother's apartment on Cross Bay Boulevard for=20
about 10 years, and started writing "On the Road" there. The novelist Paul=20
Bowles was born in Queens. Walt Whitman taught school briefly in the=20
borough, and was fired because, as a Quaker, he would not beat his students.

Simon and Garfunkel grew up in Queens, and their "59th Street Bridge Song"=20
is, arguably, set there. Stephen Dunn, who won the 2001 Pulitzer Prize for=20
poetry, lived in Forest Hills until he was in his 20's. He has never=20
written anything about it.

"The literary life of Queens has been thin," said John Tytell, an English=20
professor at Queens College.

Even as a setting, Queens has not done well. Probably its best-known=20
appearance is in F. Scott Fitzgerald's "The Great Gatsby," where Nick=20
Carraway gazes out the train window on his way out to West Egg and sees a=20
"valley of ashes," an industrial wasteland where a gigantic advertisement=20
for eyeglasses towers above the dust.

Part of the problem is that Queens has always been something of a dumping=20
ground. Vast cemeteries were built there in the 19th century after the=20
other boroughs ran out of places to bury their dead. Later came the=20
factories, and the train tracks and highways to carry Manhattanites to Long=20
Island. As a blue-collar suburb in the 20th century, it was the kind of=20
place writers struggled to escape from, no matter how cheap the rent.

In the last few decades, immigration has made Queens a far more=20
cosomopolitan place. There are at least 20 poets writing in Chinese in the=20
borough, said Philex Zhao, the executive director of the Chinese Writers=20
Association in Flushing. There are others writing verse in Marathi, Tamil,=20
Gujarathi and many other languages. Young hipsters crowd into the Indian=20
eateries of Jackson Heights and the Asian noodle shops of Flushing. The=20
borough's diversity has even inspired a collection, mostly prose, called=20
"Patchwork of Dreams," published in 1996 by a small Jackson Heights press.

Yang Hao, a 41 year-old who lives in Bayside, is one of a few immigrant=20
poets who has written about Queens. One of his poems, "Long Island=20
Expressway," was published in The China Press, a Chinese-language=20
newspaper, three years ago. "You are ever taken with jamming," he writes of=20
the highway that runs through the borough translated by Ben Wang), "Filled=20
with burning thirst/ Ever being repaired/ Ever being damaged and jolted."

Ishle Park, a young Korean American poet, is another voice of the new=20
Queens. She writes in English, and has produced a number of poems about her=20
native Flushing.

But neither of them has any interest in being identified with the borough.

"For me, Queens is like a little suburban nightmare," Ms. Park said.

The poet laureate committee has not given up hope. "We will find someone,"=20
said David Cohen, the 94-year-old Queens College librarian in charge of the=20
search.

Mr. Sirowitz, the last laureate, says he is sure there are more worthy=20
poets in Queens. He would like to help find one, but things have been going=20
well for him lately, and he is busy. He got married. He has a new book of=20
poetry coming out.

And, he adds, with an uneasy glance at the floor, he is moving to Brooklyn.

Agree to the comment of the Markson novels being such great writer's books.

I don't want to tread on any of the ways people already enjoy them, but
I just feel they invite the reader to read them in so many different
ways simultaneously and enjoy the emergence/unfolding of those many
levels of meaning/perspectives/modes of thought throughout there course
-- something I'm sure many here enjoy about the work of so many of the
writers present or talked about 'round these parts.

That's my version of the popular if you liked ________ then you'll like
_________ review, I guess.

So if you dig that kinda thing, go pick up Reader's Block and go from
there. And there are worse people to give $15 or so to than Dalkey Archive.

Then go pick up Scalapino's Defoe -- no it's not really related to this
discussion, but more people should read it, while my own thoughts about
it have never cohered enough to write a separate email. Just read it.

I'm happy to see the world-wide attention that Cid is now getting, but find
it all too much too late.  He could have really used that spread in the New
York Times and all of those other papers to promote his work and to better
his financial situation.  He hungered after this kind of publicity and even
considered trying to get his last New Directions book reviewed by Oprah
Winfrey. Can you imagine that?  He was convinced that Oprah would love
Nothing Doing and that this would be his big break!  Why does America have
it all bass-ackwards when it comes to its poets?  Jesse

Hi All-



I am working on a translation of Saadi's The Gulistan-13th century
foundational text of Persian literature-and I am looking for articles/info
dealing with mixed genre writing. The Gulistan combines prose and poetry-and
often rhymed prose, at that-in ways that Saadi is generally recognized as
originating. I am interested in articles that deal with the subject from a
historical perspective, as well as contemporary theoretical articles, as
well as anything in between.



Thanks-

hi all,

after a daily emailed correspondence with the poet Gina Myers for the month
of February, I wanted to do something different in March. At first the plan
was to lose all constraints, and just write something each night before bed.

But then my mom took ill, and the only thing on my mind each night was her.

As I write the pieces directly into the blog, look at this archival link to
see the first 18 pieces (reading from bottom up):

Americans Enjoy Their Food with More Extinction

By Gerard Levy

Staff Writer

WASHINGTON - Astronomers completed the transplant last night, waiting for
millions of tons of Earth to ply John Fairfax from life. Mr. Fairfax will
now be southern Vietnam's first work virus.

Although he can go home from the hospital, John will need new pumps
installed by Wednesday, a former Air Force intelligence analyst said, while
working on the central machine that feeds and sustains the new organs.

Fairfax's own biological heart has was lost in a collision two years ago,
when a compressor forced the southern Vietnamese government to anxiously
complicate the situation with promises of failure.

The benefits of going home for two minutes will allow scientists to master
other patients.

The right sickness can be enough to allow technology to progress at least
once a year.

Using a small telescope and a nine day vacation, medical practitioners were
able to destroy not only him, but his wife, younger stepchildren and still
have funds left to further improve the machine.

A checkup showed an irregularity on high priority status, and a function
where a kid's plaster cast and misplaced outpatients led the head surgeon to
meet with his friends at the inn.

A few boulders in the naked eye would know if the whole sky or the next two
miles would save his life, or purchase the Yucatan peninsula for the price
of a million chickens.

To make the blood easier to use, a suitcase six miles wide is employed,
which is also helpful in spray painting graffiti on a donor heart, which
research indicates could encourage it to beat.

Jabes saved my life, so I'm happy to see his name brought up. Even though I
can't read him anymore, I still respect him and his work enormously. It's
his transformation, from someone else to himself, that's most important.
When I found Jabes, writing became  possible again. I washed my hands, and
haven't stopped writing since. I told a would-be poet friend, "You've got to
read this guy." He didn't, and so remained a would-be poet. Read Jabes and
weep for joy, as here's a Jew who sees through walls.

=A0
Explosions...
The explosion two days ago was a colossal one. Our area isn't very close to
the area that got bombed, but we heard it loud and clear. It was one of
several explosions during this last week=8A but it was the biggest. The momen=
t
it happened, E. and I started trying to guess where the noise was coming
from. It has become a sort of morbid game.
Al-Jazeera almost instantly began covering the explosion and we found out
that E. was right- it was in Karada (I get the direction wrong 90% of the
time and E. chauvinistically assures me that a warped sense of direction is
quite common to most females). A hotel in the middle of a residential area
was bombed and the stories vary in a strange sort of way. People in the are=
a
claim they heard the hissing of a rocket and then an explosion. Others say
that it was an instant explosion. One news network is claiming that 32
bodies have been taken out of the rubble=8A another mentioned 17 and the Iraq=
i
police are saying that only 6 were found. Reports on the nationalities of
the deceased also vary- the Iraqi police are claiming all the residents of
the hotel were Iraqi and the Americans are saying that there were some
Americans and Brits among the dead. Who to believe?
Last Saturday and Sunday there were demonstrations in Baghdad. Students
weren't allowed into Baghdad University because the university guards
(ironically appointed by the Americans) wouldn't let anyone in. They are
part of Sistani's gang and since Sistani's followers have diligently been
objecting the TAL document signed by the Puppet Council, the guards decided
that college would be closed for a couple of days. The students had to watc=
h
the dean of the engineering college beg to be let in, and refused.
I found out about the demonstrations because I was supposed to have a job
interview on Saturday and my potential employers called me postponing it
until further notice because their guards- avid Sistani fans- had decided t=
o
take the day off to join the demonstration objecting the TAL. Sistani's
followers would not be out protesting the transitional law document if they
didn't have explicit directions from him- so
Mustansiryia University (another major university in Baghdad) is full of
student protests because the dean of the college of science requested that
after the arba'een (40th day after the death of Imam Al-Hussein), the
students take down the black flags and pictures of Al-Sadr and Sistani. The
more conservative Shi'a students immediately took offence and decided that
they wouldn't attend classes until the dean was fired. In retaliation, Sunn=
i
students decided they would organize a *protest* to the strike organized by
the Shi'a students=8A
We also heard that one of the assistant deans of the college of engineering
in Baghdad University was assassinated recently. It's terrible news and the
subject has been on my mind a lot lately. I don't know why no one focuses o=
n
this topic in the news. It's like Iraq is suffering from intellectual
hemorrhaging. Professors and scientists are being assassinated right and
left- decent intelligent people who are necessary for the future of Iraq.
Other scientists are being detained by the Americans and questioned about-
of all things- Al-Qaeda.
The stories they tell after being let go are incredible. Most of the
scientists are college professors and have dedicated their lives to teachin=
g
and research. Many are detained only because they specialize in a certain
field, like heredity, for example. One man who was recently let go told
about the ridiculous interrogation that lasted 3 days and involved CIA and
military police. They showed him picture after picture of his family,
confiscated from the family home during a raid, and kept pointing at his tw=
o
teenage sons and their friends and asking, "Aren't they a part of
Al-Qaeda?!"
And it doesn't stop with the scientists. Doctors are also being assassinate=
d
by some mysterious group. It started during the summer and has been
continuing since then. Iraq has some of the finest doctors in the region.
Since June, we've heard of at least 15 who were killed in cold blood. The
stories are similar- a car pulls up to the clinic or office, a group of men
in black step down and the doctor is gunned down- sometimes in front of the
patients and sometimes all alone, after hours. One doctor was shot brutally
in his house, in front of his family. There was a rumor that Badir's Brigad=
e
(the SCIRI militia led by Al-Hakeem) had a list out of 72 doctors that had
to be killed for one reason or another. They include Sunni, Shi'a and
Christian doctors.=20
Scientists, professors and doctors who aren't detained or assassinated all
seem to be looking for a way out. It seems like everyone you talk to is
keeping their eyes open for a job opportunity outside of the country. It
depresses me. When I hear someone talking about how they intend to leave to
Dubai or Lebanon or London, I want to beg them to stay=8A a part of me wants
to scream, "But we need you here! You belong here!" Another more rational
part of me knows that some of them have no options. Many have lost their
jobs and don't know how to feed their families. Others just can't stand the
constant worrying about their children or spouse. Many of the female doctor=
s
and scientists want to leave because it's no longer safe for women to work
like before. For some, the option is becoming a housewife or leaving abroad
to look for the security to work.
Whatever the reason, the brains are slowly seeping out of Iraq. It's no
longer a place for learning or studying or working=8A it's a place for wealth=
y
contractors looking to get wealthier, extremists, thieves (of all ranks and
origins) and troops=8A=20

...Yesterday I saw pieces of lines of poetry walking past inside my head.
Now I think of the shore bird I watched for a few minutes yesterday. It is
precisely formed & moves exactly as it must in order to feed at the very
last receding wave. Complete. The same kind of finish &  completion as in
Japanese architecture. I was compelled to look and admire. There is life,

You might want to look at the genre called Fu in China - this goes back to
the Han dynasty, and is a mixture of rhymed verse and prose; Burton Watson
has a book of translations (and commentary on the form) and there is also
a fair amount of material in Classical Chinese Literature, An Anthology of
Translations, eds. Minford and Lau.

Thanks Kirby for this gracious response.  The charge that Kerry is a "Boston
Brahmin" is, as you suggest below, specious and stupid -- and in any event,
neither here nor there when considering Emerson.  I would caution against
relying on either brief web bios or older biographies when dealing with
Emerson.  As Gougeon has put it, “Some of the most deep-seated scholarly
commonplaces regarding Emerson’s relationship to the important reforms of his
day are based upon assumptions that have obtained credibility almost solely on
the basis of historical reiteration rather than historical fact.”  Charles W.
Eliot's seminal biography, for instance, claims that “Emerson attended church
on Sundays all his life with uncommon regularity.”  This statement is a
bald-faced lie though no doubt a few critics over the years have taken it as
gospel truth.  Richardson's 1995 bio is, in contrast, really impeccable.

I don't personally know enough about Marx to say with care and precision how he
and Emerson square.  I'm better on, say, John Dewey and Adorno.  But I have my
hunches.  My good friend John Parker and I (Parker, incidentally, is writing a
book on Luther and Marx) have always talked of co-teaching a course on Marxism
and Pragmatism, but alas he's at Harvard and I ain't.

My book, I may as well say shamelessly, is priced at a fairly reasonable $27.
That's one of the many nice things about publishing in U Alabama's Modern and
Contemporary Poetics Series - they do affordable paperbacks.

David-Baptiste asked me to forward this note from him since his computer
access is shaky.  He noted in another note he sent to me that there are
statues of MAyakovsky all over the Soviet Union because of a line from
Stalin.  He also notes that Mayakovsky committed suicide, so I suppose
there is one more to add to the list.  Chirot says that he was suicided
by the state.  But I think I understood that he committed suicide over
despair over which way the revolution was going (to hell).

He felt bad that he had spent so much time making it happen.

In a similar way I feel bad that in many ways I helped to support Beat
poets and writers for so long.  I think that particular revolution stank
because of its anti-intellectualism.  I liked Ginsberg personally, and
thought he could be charming, but at Naropa it seemed that all he did
was chase after young men.  When Harry Nudel mentioned that he
(Ginsberg) himself had said that he had set up the school in order to
bag kids, it immediately made sense to me.

The first amendment in this country guarantees the right of discussion
to everyone.  Libel is extremely difficult to prove, especially for
famous people.  It's impossible for dead people.  You can say anything
you want about the dead.  This is basic to libel law, and to American
freedom.  Ginsberg is responsible for the deaths of at least three of my
high school friends because one night watching Dick Cavett he spoke
about LSD and its wondrous effects.  We got some, tripped, and two of
them went nuts.  One hanged himself and the other drove his motorcycle
through a billboard.  The third one is still a little goofy -- walks
around my home town muttering to himself.  The fourth of that gang is
writing this note.

I came to hate the revolutionary left quite early on, and have more or
less hated it ever since.   Of course we are responsible -- we were 16
-- and should have known better.  But it sounded so great!  Just like
communism!  Sounds great!

The very idea that you can try to stop people from talking about them is
what they seem to live for -- the total control of perception.  But
Ginsberg wasn't the saint that he apparently thought he was.  He was a
nutcase and a fink, even if he was also a genius.

Famous people who have had a lot of attention such as Trungpa and
Ginsberg can suck a lot of people down into their Vortex.  If you can't
say that you think that they were horrible, and can only say that they
were saints, then you leave a lot of other people open to being
destroyed by them.  Naropa has had a lot of horrible things go on
there.  Anyone who values their mental hygiene should step lightly in
that place, as its karma is sick.  I enjoyed my two summers at Naropa,
but I found it hard to believe, too.  I love Corso's poetry, and thank
Ginsberg for what he did for Corso in terms of keeping him alive.  I
also think that Ginsberg was charming and generous to many many other
people.  I think we should also be free to discuss his wicked side
(NAMBLA), as well as other aspects of the man.  It's a matter of mental
hygiene.

There are worse places than Naropa (I'd probably go there again if I was
a young poet again in order to study with Anselm -- even though he too
sometimes strikes me as well, he's alive, so I'm not going to say
anything except that I think he's overly loyal to his friends).  The
Soviet Union was a worse place for poets than Naropa.  But here is
brilliant David Chirot recommending its poet Mayakovsky's theory of
Marxist poetry -- amuse-toi bien!

so what is going on here with this gay marriage? is this really about=20
being able to get married? how does queerness relate to the=20
commodification factor, hetronormative  hegemony?

this is not about the weddings . . . . I repeat, this is not about=20
being able to get married!!! and it is!!!!

  the weddings have become the spark of major flash points world wide,=20=

and are symtomatic of a variety of problems.

  first the wedding . . . if you want to get married and buy into the=20
hegemony, fine . . .  if one of the motivating factors for getting=20
married is to get all the benefits of the power structure, fine . . . .=20=

but what if you do not want to buy into that system? why should only=20
those that get married have a 1000 privileges . . . . so, then the=20
problem is one of hoarding power by patriarchal privilege as an act of=20=

ownership . . . . then the broader question is one of  social critique=20=

. . . . why do only those who get married have those privileges? I=20
think the answer is fairly obvious, in a hetro-hierarchy of power, and=20=

any act wanting to share heterosexual privilege over another type of=20
relationship is seen as a threat to to power structure.

the problem is, queers are being limited and not denied the opportunity=20=

to buy into that system , not matter what one thinks of it. if one=20
wants to go to disneyland, fine . . . everyone should be able to enter=20=

the land of oz, who wants to.

unequal rights is unequal rights... separate but equal is separate but=20=

unequal...

what has happened is the power elite, the hetronormative command and=20
control are feeling threaten and in turn are thrusting their ideal of a=20=

perfect identity forward, as a legal and moral right; . . . this in=20
turn casts those not that into the *other space.* one that does not=20
deserve rights, one that is looked upon as morally wrong, and one that=20=

is a bad influence to the majority, a super situated identity forced to=20=

come forth as that, no longer able to hide in the closet

this has caused identity politics to raise its head the *us* is right=20
and you are you and you are wrong, because you are not us. maybe it is=20=

time to stop living as second class citizen world wide... to stand up=20
and fight...


this is where the flash points come in .. the assertion of one identity=20=

over other, or one identity demanding the privileges of another...

here are some areas of concern beyond just the fact that marriage is=20
being held as a privileged site for heterosexuals.

1. state after state passing or attempting to pass amendments to ban=20
gay marriages. the fact that there are laws written to limit social=20
movement is a red flag. now there is a push an amendment to the=20
constitution to be added on a national level... if the meer fact that=20
lawmakers are proposing to change the constitution does not worry you .=20=

. . . think again!! . . . it is a major problem . . . . this will=20
institute second class citizenry. where now, for the most part, it is=20
just group think, with some laws to protect the minority from the=20
majority group think..

2. states, and counties are cutting backs rights, privileges and=20
protections of queer adults and children. (orange country, CA, does not=20=

want to offer equal rights protection to trans youth)

3. hate crimes have risen 24% in the last 3 months . . . . what will it=20=

be like as laws are passed, creating an institutional second class=20
group? what will happen as more and more moralizing religious bigots=20
spill their hate speech on to the world trying to create a solid ground=20=

. . . .  more license to act out their rage to subdue those that=20
threaten an already mythological power.

4. queer folkz are losing their jobs simply because they are queer,  as=20=

the queer priest did /is. a queer reporter and a photographer, recently=20=

married, were taken off an assignment to cover the *GAY WEDDINGs*=20
simply because the paper thought there was a conflict of interest . . .=20=

  which would not happen to a straight person . . . . add to that a=20
queer couple did not qualify for a home loan because they where not=20
considered a couple...


5. it has been ruled federal employes can lose their job simply for=20
being gay.

6. folks have been arrested for marrying queer folks.

7. there is a blindness to HIV because it is connected to queers even=20
though world wide, more heterosexuals have HIV then queers

8. increased censorship of queer media....

9. cutting back on gay adoptions.


this is just some of the problems that are happening world wide . . ..
now is the time to stand up and take the next step in queer civil=20
rights!
  now is the time to take a stance for human civil rights - includeing=20=

Thanks to Anselm Hollo for confirming what I'd suspected from Maria Damon's
post- that the "unknown person" at Naropa was George Evans. George is
another gift from my relationship with Cid Corman. It was Cid who pointed me
to Evans' SUDDEN DREAMS, a book I still pick up in used bookstores to share
with friends & new readers. I think he's from Pittsburgh, & living in San
Francisco(?)

Kirby Olson, how DARE you say that about Ginsberg!!!!!!!

to negate a man's ENTIRE life like that!

to devalue his importance, and to malign the hard work he did!

to brand him a sexual predator makes me question you and what
your own cock must have on its mind.

every straight man i've ever met who points to gay men as being
insatiable sex addicts who will go to any means to get cock is
almost always a straight guy who ain't gettin' any unless he's payin'.

Louise Gluck is another who took shots at Ginsberg when i heard her
read some years ago.  she called him "a mere footnote in the history
of poetry."  as though she's ever written a single outstanding thing
which changed the way we read poetry!  she's out of her fucking mind!
and so are you!

I largely agree, but let me try to be more temperate. I knew Allen, and
I've known a lot of other poets. Most of them, of whatever gender, like
almost everyone else I've known, have been sexually active to the point of
near indiscriminateness at some point or other in their lives. Few have
founded writing programs to get laid--it seems like a lot of work for
something that's not that difficult--tho some have done some of their
mating within their work environment, it being where they spend most of
their time, and this sometimes leads to abuses.

The fact is, by the time he got involved with Naropa it had been a long
time since Allen, with all his fame, had suffered from a lack of willing
sexual partners.

Notice that until now I haven't used the word predator, which I think is
hard to justify if one is talking about uncoerced sex between those above
the age of consent.

Mark, thanks for making these points. They were what occurred to me, but I
was hoping someone who knew Ginsberg personally would make them. I'd like to
say a little more about your last point, though. Any sexual relationship can
be or become predatory, by a literal, non-legal definition. So can any
non-sexual relationship. We have decided, as a society, to say that those
who have reached the age of 18 are their own sexual responsibility (we can
debate the age, but it's obvious we have to pick one). Yes, older people do
sometimes emotionally manipulate younger people into bed. Sometimes, it
happens the other way around. To call a 66-year-old man fucking an
18-year-old man "predatory," without specific evidence, does not help the
18-year-old. It takes away the adulthood our culture assures him is his; it
removes from him the freedom of choice that is so essential for his
education as a productive member of society. To disallow our children to
pick older partners, even foolishly, is to block one of their most
fundamental rights as adults. And at some age, we have to call our children
adults.

As far as the actionability of Kirby's and Harry's claims, well, hate to
break it to you guys, but if Naropa can prove that your comments are both
untrue and financially harm Naropa, Ginsberg can be 100 years dead and you
can still be sued, although it won't be called "slander." See L. Ron
Hubbard. That said, does anyone really care how Kirby and Harry feel about
Naropa? Does anyone really think that it will harm Naropa in any way? Does
anyone think it will hurt Ginsberg's sales? Does anyone think that if
Ginsberg was reading this list, it would hurt so much as his *feelings?*
Again, I didn't know the man, but I had the impression his skin was a little
thicker than that.

mIEKAL:

It happened this way. I met a woman at the Helene Wurlitzer Foundation, in
Taos, NM. Her name was Etta Blum. Etta's first book of poems, which was
published sometime during the 1940s, received acclaim from some major
critics. (William Carlos Williams asked her for a review copy, but she never
wrote him back!)
 Soon afterwards, she married a Yiddish writer who was in the circle of I.B.
Singer. Unlike Singer, he never became well-known. Etta stopped writing to
raise the children (Unfortunately, this is not an unusual story.)
Afterwards, she became a teacher in the NYC system. When I met her, she was
in her early 70s, and had been writing again for a number of years, but
never got much recognition again.
 When her time at the foundation was over, she moved to Santa Fe. I returned
to Santa Fe, too, where Etta and I had some interesting discussions. The
woman _lived_ literature. She died from cancer about a year later.
After I moved to Albuquerque, I was looking through her archive, which is at
the University of New Mexico. I was amazed at the people with whom she had
been in contact. In one letter, someone--I forget who--wrote that she
"should take a look at Edmund Jabes's 'The Book of Questions.'" I don't know
whether she did. But I know that I did, and it changed my life.

i have an odd request.  i am in the middle of putting together the next
issue of _moria_, but i haven't received much interesting work from females
(or other than male) poets to pick from.  usually i have plently of work
from women, but this time around things are different.  did something in the
current issue turn female readers away?  i can't see what.  moreover, i'm
not really interested in counting up females vs males vs mixed genders, but
i am troubled when i look at a magazine and see only males (or in the case
of the forthcoming _moria_, only two females).  my request is for
experimental poets who are females to send something quickly.

A long interview with Jabes by Jason Weiss was published in Conjunctions I
think it was IX, circa 1985, and reprinted iun Jason's book Writing at Risk
(Iowa 1991). It's first-rate.

It's news to me, too, that Jabes needs reviving. I didn't know his work had
fallen from view.

It's all over the house here, Blanchot as well. There's a nexus among
Schwerner, Jabes, Celan, Akkadian/Sumerian/Assyrian texts. There's a
problematic spatiality, nomadicism, ecology at work. Gematria of blurred
numerologies. In some way my writing is within the nexus as well. I look
for guidance. Alan

Harry, guess what, you're wrong about us losing the thread.
(don't bother trying to deflect from your actions at this point)

but you're right about the thread being about P.O.W.E.R.

the POWER of the living to slander the dead!

JUST EXACTLY what did you SAY when you heard this alleged
conversation about cornering and snaring the young
studs from poetry class?

nothing!

and WHY!?  because A) it didn't happen.

B) you're too much of a coward to saying ANYTHING
about this until Ginsberg is long dead!

your pathetic cowardice is the creepiest, frankly.

and by the way, none of us need to be reminded
of freedom of speech.  THAT'S EXACTLY why the
response to the brave Harry Nudel who wants to
malign Ginsberg when he can no longer defend
his long life of amazing accomplishments!

you're like some grotesque gossip columnist who
is bitter about not getting a movie role they wanted.
and as soon as the celebrated lead dies, you go at
their character, telling some invented tale you've told
so many times you finally believe it yourself.

you're right we do have freedom of speech, and yes
it protects scum like you.

Yours truly!
CAConrad

hi c.a. and all,

the last thing i ever thought i'd do on this list was defend nudel, but i'm
guessing we all have the story of a friend of ours who Allen at least
sexually harassed. My first summer at Naropa, at one of the hottub parties I
missed, Bataan Faigao's house i think, a poet friend of mine, young, blonde,
and thin, has a naked from the hot tub Ginsberg grab him by the ears and
kiss him. And it was taken as a, "Oh, that's just Allen being Allen." Now if
Andrew Schelling had done that to a female student it would mean a
suspension for Schelling, leading to dismissal, and possible criminal
charges, it wouldn't be just, "Oh, that's Andrew being Andrew."

and now we get into what this all means--do we, for example, think less of
MLK because he plagiarized his doctorate and purportedly ran around on
Coretta. I'm of the view that a person's postivie political or artistic acts
can be separated from their negative personal ones, but ultimately we can,
and do, think lesser of them.

as ever,
david

David, fine, but that's not my point.

my point is that these stories wouldn't be discussed
(especially on this list) if Ginsberg were still alive!

and that Kirby Olson and Harry Nudel want us to buy
this cocka-maymee idea that Ginsberg was such an
uncontrollable pig that poetry had NOTHING to do with
the amazing dedication he had for NAROPA.  that's just
fucking inexcusable!

Lamont Steptoe has a poem about Ginsberg's sperm
swimming in his stomach.  but at least he wrote this
when Ginsberg was alive.

when big name straight guy poets get nookie
(do you think that they don't?)
is it as creepy to everyone?

the creepy part that keeps coming
up is bordering on homophobia.

jealousy is so pathetic!

and as i've said before, go ahead and say
what you want.  but i will respond, as i want.

i agree; this is an extraordinary story. it could be the basis of
some kind of anthology...of short autobiographical vignettes of
poetic influence or spark.

For what it's worth, I second this and other objections to the post. But =

Kirby, you should be ashamed of yourself.  And so should Mr. Noodle.

Such unsubstantiated claims / quotes are actionable.  Be forewarned.

For the record, a great many of us took hallucinogens back then. Very few=20
of us did so because of Allen.

Very few were damaged by them, either. I worked with adolescents in  mental=

damaged than the general population--I mean, it was a mental health=20

=20
them took it. Of those who did some, but by no means all, of those who were=

weren't well-socialized enough to make the necessary contacts.

Even in the case of PCP, whose otherwise non-psychotic users were far more=

there seemed to be no long-term effect--they seemed no more likely to have=

The lesson here is that the presence of two variables doesn't prove that=20

I would be curious to know what connection you divine between LSD and=20

I agree with Harry on this one (and so does Buffy the Vampire Slayer:
it's about the power).

Now, could we lose this speculative and adolescent thread and talk of
something of real interest, like Sam Tanenhaus election as High Priest, oh
wait, Editor of the NYTBR.  I think an email campaign about how the Times
treats poetry is in order.

Hi Robert,

I believe Buffy said that to Dawn, at the beginning of the seventh season,
when she was seperated from both of the bloodsucking men she loved. The rest
of the seventh season seemed to be an attempt to prove her wrong. Note that
the series ends with Spike saving the world. Despite the hooplah that was
made about the dessimation of the power of the slayer, the real victory over
evil was won by Spike, who was only able to save the world because of his
willingness to surrender his power and channel the power of another force,
which he could only do after acquiring a soul (a loss of power),
surrendering his own rights to the rights of a team that tried to kill him,
and surrendering all his rights, including his life, to his unconditional
love of Buffy (the greatest loss of power imaginable), and, by extension,
humanity. One needs hardly point out that Anya died in the final exchange
and the powerless Andrew survived. One probably shouldn't point out that the
21-year-old Buffy was fearless in her rejection of her teachers and mentors
when they became dangerous to her mission and/or her happiness.

If poets are supposed to be connected to humanity at all, I think a
discussion of Buffy will serve us far better than a discussion of Tanenhaus.
Perhaps we should contrast and compare.

a friend just fwdid this to me,
quite entertaining::


 Make the Pie Higher
poem composed of quotations by george bush

I think we all agree, the past is over.
This is still a dangerous world.
It's a world of madmen and uncertainty
And potential mental losses.

Rarely is the question asked
Is our children learning?

Will the highways of the Internet
Become more few?

How many hands have I shaked?
They misunderestimate me.
I am a pitbull on the pantleg of oppurtunity.

I know that the human being
And the fish can coexist.
Families is where our nation finds hope,
Where our wings take dream.

Put food on your family!
Knock down the tollbooth!
Vulcanize society!
Make the pie higher!
Make the pie higher!


** And, if you haven't seen it yet, check out George Bush's unofficial
yearbook :: link to the image in the freshest post at
http://incertainplume.blogspot.com **


pluminously yours,

Ela:

This morning, I looked in Powells and found a copy of Etta Blum's first
book, "Poems." (Golden Eagle Editions 1937.) Inside there are a few
handwritten letters from her. Of course I bought it, along with a paperback
copy of "The Space My Body Fills," published by Stonestone Press, 1982.
(There's a hardback edition that she self-published.) What treasures!
 We have the same archivist, at The University of New Mexico, so someday
I'll send the book and the letters there.

Best Regards,
Joel

incredible!

obviously (in the root-sense of the word!), the book was waiting for your
encounter.



i requested her poems through interlibrary loan. really intrigued: both by
the poems as well as by the silence separating the two collections (1937 -
1975, is it?) -- and, as i mentioned, by her very name, as arbitrary as such
attractions may be: it speaks to me of taut reticence & quiet explosion.

if you should ever scan the letters to jaypegs, i would be grateful for an
emailing.

Ela:

This morning, I looked in Powells and found a copy of Etta Blum's first
book, "Poems." (Golden Eagle Editions 1937.) Inside there are a few
handwritten letters from her. Of course I bought it, along with a paperback
copy of "The Space My Body Fills," published by Stonestone Press, 1982.
(There's a hardback edition that she self-published.) What treasures!
 We have the same archivist, at The University of New Mexico, so someday
I'll send the book and the letters there.

Best Regards,
Joel

I'm new to this list but I'm intrigued also by this. Is it possible that I
can share in reading the letters and the poems? I am now also on the hunt to
read Jabes's Book of Questions.
Thank you so much!

Well, Ginsberg wasn't the only one on the prowl at Naropa, and students
and faculty were probably equally so at that period in time.   From this
perspective, it seems creepy.  But this is after twenty years of
feminism telling on profs and pointing out the power differential.  Yes,
it did hurt some institutions.  The only way to keep institutions in
check sometimes is to publish their bullshit.  The Dalai Lama himself
says as much in the link I'm adding to this post.

I just cracked up when Nudel reported this about the Ginz.  I felt like
I had stepped into a cowpie that had been set for me.  And I did publish
my original piece on the Ginz while he was still alive.  I'm sure he
couldn't have cared less.  The guy was a laugh-meister.

LSD and communism and Allen Ginsberg and on and on.  I don't put all of
these things in the same basket.

For instance, some hippies were communists, but Allen wasn't.  He wasn't
really even a Marxist.  The Marxists were always mad at him for it.
Some of his poems touch on that.  He's a bit red from his mom, but not
very red.  He was a good capitalist, it seems to me.

He was something else, too -- some kind of romantic out of Blake.  Look
through his theoretical texts -- he writes about Blake, not Marx.  It's
a good simple take on Blake, too.  Very nice.  Genius, probably.  Didn't
I say that?  People are so touchy.  So black and white.  Either you're
with us or against us.  That's why I hate the sixties and just wish
they'd get the fuck over with so we could go back to being fallen and
cool it with all the Pelagian sainthood.  Saints make me sick, and
besides they don't exist.

Harry and I are just noodlers, so try to relax.  Your icons are not
sacred.  These people sucked.  They were still more interesting than a
lot of people who sucked in other ways.

Try to relax and lower your expectations of the world.

One, there aren't any saints, and if there were, I would kill them.  So
would everybody else.

Two, artists are motivated by all kinds of things, and one of them is
sex.  Big deal.  Like, man, like Freud even knew that, ok?

As for Naropa, all kinds of poets have come down on the place.  Ed
Sanders, Tom Clark, and many many others -- Bly, Snyder, etc.  That's
part of our duty.  To give each institution a bloodbath in order to
guarantee hygiene.  It's not to give some kind of fascist salute.

If the Kentucky Fried Chicken sells you a rat, and you publicize it, and
this hurts their sales, then it doesn't mean that you can be sued for
it, or that you should be.  It's a public duty to point out rattiness..

Look up Naropa and there are tens of thousands of people bellyaching
about the place.

Try this link for more on Trungpa, Osel Tenzin, and all that.
Personally, I got a lot ouit of the place and escaped without so much as
a few laughs, and a few strange stories.  People were talking about some
joint up in Chicago a few months back.  Some sort of poetry school.
Personally I felt it was very nasty, and tried to introduce a note of
humor to give some perspective.  Frankly, I doubt if any institution is
either totally demonic or totally saintly.  Strange that the vested
interests of that place in Chicago didn't start screaming law suit.
Personally, I liked Naropa, although I have mixed feelings about some of
its founders.  Excuse me, but is that permissable?  Try this link --
there's more about sexual predators among the new Buddhist guru-types.
Suffice it to say that the Catholic church is full of them, too.  Now if
nobody was allowed to point this out, then there wouldn't be law suits.
But law suits can go both ways.  I could claim that Ginsberg wrecked my
life, for instance.  He messed me up in many ways.  He probably did lots
of other young men, too.  Some of the young Catholics are claiming that
sort of thing, decades later, and getting paid millions.  I could
probably close the place, but I have no interest in doing that.
Institutions have responsibilities to those who go through them.
Personally I consider myself ahead for having attended Naropa, but there
were some things I wish I could have known in advance.  Live and learn.
At least I wasn't hurt as badly as some of the people seemingly were in
the following story --

I've been called a
haberdasher, scum &
noodle on this listserv..
talk of lack of P.O.W.E.R...

I'd like to clarify one pt
& then drop the thread...

someone asked why
i didn't argue with Allen G
when he made  his
'to coin a phrase'
smart ass remark..

he wasn't talking to me..
i overheard it..& more
i was too busy trying
to sleep with my own students
(without much success)


i had just studied with
John Logan...
a great teacher &
exemplary person..tho
he drank a six-pack
too much..

who was then living with
 & i assume fucking
a former male student..my
next door neighbor
at 50 divorces his ex
and married an undergrad
& two  Eng.profs  the term
before switched wives..

this was centuries ere
they had committees
on sexual harrassment..

William Mathew's son
in his new memoir of his
father (i assume a reliable
source) says his dad offered
him (at 17) the pick of the
litter of his grad po students..
(they'd all sleep with him..
"if he sd so")

When i was in CCNY..
40 or more or so yrs
ago i heard two coeds
talkin' of a prof..
'he made me do things
that i'm ashamed of"

these were in the days
'fore anal & oral sex
were the fodder of
every  Howard Stern day..

touchee touchee yr
idol..or..ideals...

power destroyed
Ginsies poetry
& the little humanity
he had in him...

maybe it would
have taken a saint
to do otherwise...

i'm just reporting
the ...facts..maam..

ready aim fire..

you killed the messenger...

Thanks for the insightful posts regarding slander, Naropa and Ginsberg. =
As someone who teaches in a university setting I'm particularly aware of =
the eros between instructor/student. And I feel very strongly that this =
is a power relationship, one that should never be tampered with. I know =
that Ginsberg was a bit of a prowler--he spoke pretty openly about that =
and it's a part of him I find disturbing. Pema Chodron also speaks about =
Trungpa Rimpoche and his sexual exploits--I know there are no sacred =
cows. I suppose what I was reacting to was the aloof manner in which the =
comments about Ginsberg were offered--the lack of context. The issue is =
large and complicated and I respect trying to open up that dialogue in =
some way. I guess I also question the intent of posting like that. I =
mean was this meant to just diss Ginsberg, or to start a discussion =
about why the academy, for all of it's sexual harassment savvy, seems to =
still feel like it's fine to have professors having affairs with =
students, because that would be useful. To be honest, I find it =
baffling.

Sonnet:  Democracy Red in Tooth and Claw

When my mother asked me to go with her to sell the house,
I thought at first she was just a tad loopy, considering that our representatives
are supposedly guided by the citizenry, that gardening isn't quite as good
as it used to be at relieving our stress and anxiety, that there are still

folks who smoke by lighting one cigarette from the butt of another, who
personally observe events, and then make up their minds. She'd spent a lot
of time watching large birds swoop to pick off smaller ones at the feeder
one by one, and thought that public life, either in business or government, must

be pretty much the same as that. At least, I thought, she didn't rely upon
the press to be informed. In fact, whenever she'd see TV images
of bombs bursting in the air of Iraq, she'd said, "See? Those are the seeds
of democracy being planted." She'd call the green of night-vision lenses

the green thumb of liberty. And I never knew exactly how much irony to give
her credit for. "Extremity at the edge of terror"—her last words on the subject.

His place in history

By Dinah Cardin
Friday, March 19, 2004



He was one of the most influential poets of the last century, and
Gloucester was his main muse. Now, a filmmaker wants to make sure
Charles Olson's legacy lives on in his hometown.

A cast of characters far from whom you would expect to see actually
dirty dancing, much less at a movie about the act, recently turned up
for a premiere screening of "Dirty Dancing: Havana Nights" at Lowe's
Liberty Tree Mall Cinema in Danvers.

  The crowd appeared middle aged, educated, quite socially conscious ...
oh, and was there to shell out $30 a head to support a documentary film
about a poet. OK. That's more like it.

  The sneak peak at the new dancing movie (sans Jennifer Grey) produced
by Gloucester's Sarah Green, who also produced "Frida" and "State and
Main," was to help her good friend, Gloucester filmmaker Henry Ferrini,
with his latest project, "Poet & The City," a film about poet Charles
Olson and his connection to Gloucester.

  Though Olson was one of the key literary figures of the last century,
Ferinni says he is hardly known in his beloved Gloucester. Olson, who
died in 1970, had a real interest in a sense of place -the focus of
many of Ferrini's films. Olson seemed to "change the landscape,"
Ferrini says, with his writing. His masterpiece, "The Maximus Poems,"
is all about Gloucester: "The geography which leans in on me, I compel
backwards I compel Gloucester to yield, to change."

  National Public Radio called his epic piece one of the top 15 poems of
the 20th century.

  Educated at Wesleyan and Harvard, Olson's work inspired other great
poets of the '60s, such as Allen Ginsberg, and though he wasn't exactly
in New York or jotting his impressions of trips cross-country, they
called him "the big fire source." Though it often takes a dictionary
and encyclopedia on hand to understand much of his work (an
accompanying guide to the "Maximus Poems" is 800 pages), it is
important that the people of Gloucester come to appreciate it, says
Ferrini.

  One of his greatest achievements was his research and writing about
Herman Melville. Olson was able to collect 100 of the original volumes
that had been dispersed from Melville's library, and in deciphering his
scribblings from the margins was able to put together a whole new look
at Melville's thinking behind "Moby Dick," particularly evident to
Olson in Melville's notes on Shakespeare. From this came Olson's work,
"Call Me Ismael."

  "Only poets sort of understood him. He was a language guy and you need
a couple of Phds to understand him. The connection with Olson for me is
he's such a large character in this town that nobody knows anything
about, and I find that to be really intriguing," says Ferrini. "I know
a heck of a lot more than a lot of people in this town. But I'm still
learning a lot. I want to make him accessible. I'm hoping to create a
window so the viewer can get a sense of what he was about and a sense
of how he interacts with the place. Gloucester was a major force in his
writing. If I can make a film half as exciting as some of his poems,
I'm doing OK."

  To help create that window, the film will include sometimes very
intimate audio recordings and films of Olson reading his work.

  Ferrini is nephew to Gloucester's poet laureate, Vincent Ferrini, who
was friendly with Olson.

  In 1957, after a long hiatus away, Olson wrote to Vincent Ferrini from
his new apartment at Fort Square: "I return to the city and my first
thought, Ferrini, is of you who for so long has been my body here and I
a shadow coming in like gullsh-."


Back to school

  Olson was trained as a scholar and taught at Harvard in the '30s. He
gave John F. Kennedy a C in his class, remarking he hadn't yet learned
to express himself.

  In addition to being an academic, Olson also had a political career.
After Harvard, he went to work for the office of war information as an
analyst and had a high office in the Democratic Party. He was
considered for the position of postmaster general before working as a
New Dealer during the FDR administration. He later served as rector at
the radical experimental Black Mountain College in North Carolina.

  When the college folded, he came back to Gloucester to complete his
epic work before he died of liver cancer at the age of 59.

  Ferrini often finds himself on projects about writers and poets. He
paid tribute to his uncle in "Poem in Action," and in 2000 released
"Lowell Blues," a film about the blue-collar city seen through the eyes
of its most famous beat poet. True to Jack Kerouac, he included an
original spicy jazz score and readings from several powerful voices,
including Johnny Depp.

  The filmmaker is working with Gloucester educators so that the Olson
piece may one day be as useful a teaching tool to the community's
children as "Lowell Blues" has been to the children of Lowell, so that
young students may truly understand the legend others will be
associating with their hometown for the rest of their lives. He has
already received a grant from the Essex National Heritage Commission to
help create the teacher's companion to the Olson film.

  "Maybe some kids read some Kerouac, but now every one of them gets a
taste," says Ferrini. "I'm sure in 50 years it would still be used if
there's a teacher who is interested in poetry and how poetry informs
the places where we live. And that's also why Gloucester people realize
that Olson is an untapped treasure and resource and one that really
needs addressing. It will have a broad-based public television airing,
but its real evergreen use will be at the Gloucester High School."


Read it by reading

  There are definitely those who would like to see this film completed.
Olson's son, Charles Peter, lives in Gloucester, and so do many of the
members of the recently formed Charles Olson Society, created in
conjunction with the international version in British Columbia, to form
awareness of the poet's life and work. The society considers fund
raising for the film and seeing its completion its top priority. The
film is going to do two very important things, says Peter Anastas of
the Olson Society.

  "It's going to show people who Olson was and what his contribution was
to American literature, but it's also going to show how you live in
your own place," he says. "What does it mean to love the place you live
in, to make your life in it - the importance of place in all of our
lives. It goes right back to the founding of America, Plymouth,
Gloucester, Salem. They were extremely important to the people who
founded them."

  Anastis agrees that Olson is a "difficult" poet, but says the writer,
whose defense was simply that that was the way his mind worked, teaches
us how to read him.

  "If you jump into the poetry and stay with it, you will learn how the
poetry works. You don't have to start at the beginning. You can jump
into the "Maximus Poems" anywhere. You can go forward. You can go
back," says Anastis. "You learn to read Olson by reading it. The
personal is there, the historical is there, there's geography there and
it all comes together as kind of a mosaic and that's how Olson wrote."

  Though he stood 6-foot-8 and weighed 265 pounds, perhaps it was his
desire and ability to live as a real resident of the town that made
Olson's achievements slip beneath the radar.

  "(Gloucester residents) should know that a major American poet lived
in their midst a very ordinary life, going to the store, going to the
post office, walking in the streets," says Anastas.

  "An absolutely major American poet lived in their midst," he stresses.
"He was like the conscience of Gloucester, writing letters to the
editor about saving this and not letting that go, about understanding
the importance of Gloucester and saving the wetlands."

  Of course, Olson hated writers' societies and blasted the Herman
Melville Society in 1951 when it invited him to join its members in
celebrating the 100th anniversary of "Moby Dick."

  "It's extremely ironic that we have founded the Charles Olson Society
when Olson hated the Herman Melville Society," says Anastis.

  Yet, the Melville Society, Olson believed, was comprised of teachers
and scholars who were using Melville to advance their careers. The
Olson Society is not an academic society, but rather to help people
understand what Olson was about and bring poetry into their lives. And
not just Olson's poetry, says Anastis, but all poetry.

  "It's really to try to help people understand the importance of Olson
and the relevance of his ideas," he says, listing among them the
dangers of greed, concern for the environment, historical preservation
and remaining connected to one's home and history. "And those ideas are
extremely important today."


  'Dirty' money

  Ferrini was always making plans to do a film about Olson. The
interviews got jumpstarted back in 1995 when several admirers and
colleagues were in town to speak on the poet during the Charles Olson
Festival in July of that year. Ferrini got out his camera and began
gathering the stories right there.

  But despite the recent surge in interest for poetry, with slams and
readings and even the popularity of online publishing of one's own
verse, Ferrini has been on a rocky journey to fund this project. He
found that doing the award-winning Jack Kerouac thing, now seen in
about 15 countries, didn't hurt. Still, the filmmaker laments that the
ever-popular Kerouac contemporary Ginsberg is no longer around to make
his contribution to the documentary.

  "He was a close friend," Ferrini says. "I think if I had him in the
can it would have been a lot easier to get the film made."

  Still, using television and film is a wonderful way to grow the
audience for poetry, he says. He walked away with about $6,500 from the
"Dirty Dancing" screening benefit, and hopes to complete the film,
currently still in production, by April 2005 to premiere it at the Cape
Ann Historical Museum in Gloucester for National Poetry Month.

  With many films under his belt, Ferinni is used to this routine of
working on the good stuff while the funding is there, even with
occasional help from research assistants when the money holds out, and
then setting them aside to do commercial work to pay the bills. In
1990, he completed a film called "Radio Fishtown" about Simon Geller,
Gloucester's stubborn, eccentric and beloved resident, who was the last
one-man radio operation in the country, until it was bought out by
WBOQ. The film won Bravo's Hometown Video Award for Documentary Film by
a Media Professional and was broadcast on PBS affiliate WGBH.

  He also made "Witch City," on one community's insistence on cashing in
on the events of 1692, as "a cautionary tale of what happens when
history is distorted by both merchants and would-be prophets."

  As for the recent fund-raiser's odd pairing of commercial vehicle and
documentary film, Ferrini says he's simply grateful.

  "It's great, because the pieces are so diametrically opposed," he
says. "It's sort of the ying and yang of the movie scene. That's sort
of the beauty of it. There's nothing that connects it except that Sarah
Green wanted to support a filmmaker whose work she believes in."

Haven't read Jabes in years, but when I did I was reading the Zohar at the
same time and it's all there--esp. in the first books--the meditations of
the word and the book and the word in the book and the destiny of the
readers of the book.  Jesse

Chicago

Blog Butcher for the World
Stacker of Paper
Airline delayer
City of the Big Pizza
freeze my nose hairs

The other soft cities laugh and I say
give me two orders of fries with my Italian Beef
and I sit on two stools since I am midwestern thick bottom does not fit
The other cities may have fashion and power but we have the futility of
178 years without a world series

I have seen your painted ladies Chicago
Under your five layers of clothes
and your hat
ánd boots
avoiding the icey puddles

Chicago Blog Butcher for the world

The Reappearance of the Aesthetic

Panelists:  Kass Fleisher, Joe Amato, Christina Milletti, Dimitri

We'll consider the reemergence of the (literary) aesthetic hinted at
in a ~Critical Inquiry~ colloquium that received the unfavorable
attention of ~The New York Times~. This colloquium of noted scholars
began with a call for statements "suggesting" that "the major
challenge for the humanities in the coming century will be to
determine the fate of literature and to secure some space for the
aesthetic in the face of the overwhelming forces of mass culture and
commercial entertainment." We hope to speculate on the form and
substance of this "space" of aesthetic practice.

Sina, I have a pretty full list of problems -- here's two:

1.  what is the nature of the educational institution?  (in early 19th ce=
ntury America they were all turning out priests for the priesthood -- eve=
n Harvard was doing this)  What are we doing now?  As the Christian parad=
igm disappears from our institutions and the postmodernism paradigm fills=
 this void, what is it filling it with?  If desire, and willfulness, then=
 nothing can be critiqued, and there is no responsibility for anything (N=
ietzsche was already making this claim along with his death of God bit). =
 What happens to the weak in this process -- the young, the poor, the chi=
ldren, those who are not geniuses?

2.  The role of the instructor?  Without responsibility, what is he or sh=
e doing?  If there's a responsibility -- to whom and what?  There seem to=
 only be selves, now, and nothing transcendent -- family is a joke, count=
ry is a joke, God is a joke.  There is race, gender, and class.  Rather d=
ivisive categories, that assume that war on the mainstream is a good thin=
g.  Once they win, then what?  Camps?  Then what?

(Ginsberg I think that provided a dangerous model.  He was hellbent on hi=
s own pleasure seeking, and as he told Norman Podhoretz -- we will get yo=
u through your children!  I was too young to understand the history of wh=
at he was doing when I came across him.   I felt personally devastated by=
 him, and was terrified of him -- he had tremendous charisma, and not muc=
h concern for the weaker people in his presence.  I think in general olde=
r geniuses should be aware of how weak their students are -- and I think =
the model should be neighborliness, rather than willfull selfishness)

So yeah, in a clumsy way, I'm trying to talk about the things that you me=
ntioned, but the only way I can find to discuss them is to leave the post=
modern model and revert to the Lutheran model of my childhood.  I don't h=
ave any other vocabulary, and my vocabulary is infantile -- prodigal son =
that I am in that tradition.

-- Kirby

 As someone who teaches in a university setting I'm particularly aware of=
 the eros between instructor/student. And I feel very strongly that this =
is a power relationship, one that should never be tampered with. I know t=

 I guess I also question the intent of posting like that. I mean was this=

Allen Ginsberg draws attention to the collusion between "mass communication"
and conformist opinion in 1959 in his Independence Day Manifesto. Perhaps
it's difficult for some on this listserv today to imagine mainstream America
as the rightwing aparat that some believe it has become, and that it was,
for Ginsberg, in this manifesto, through Fall of America, etc. It makes
sense that it is difficult to think so, unfortunately. I don't know if my
tongue is supposed to be in my cheek or not as I write this. Anyway,
Ginsberg, el Beat, was as a poet in a tiny minority on this point of mass
conspiracy. When he writes of this as "mass conspiracy," he healthily keeps
his humor intact it would seem to me, but he also displays all seriousness
of conviction. (I'm grateful to Tim Yu who renewed my attention to this
Ginsberg piece somewhile ago in a different context, the first collected in
Deliberate Prose.)

George Lakoff and cohorts attempt to address the scope of mainstream
America's rightist swing, in terms of its effects on language and politics,
at the Rockridge Institute http://www.rockridgeinstitute.org/. And recently
the journalist Jerry Landay has attempted to disclose the extent the USA has
become a corporate-driven one-party state, in the essay, "The Apparat"
http://www.mediatransparency.com/stories/apparat.html, detailing the
concerted funding of rightwing thinktanks, AM radio stations, tv opinion
makers, lobbyists, etc etc, since the early 1970s on. And this is just
within the terms of "liberal" versus "neoconservative"!!

Believe it or not, I think this has to do with poetry. Feeling "bad" about
supporting poetry, Kirby, would be a truly sad day (although I don't know
what you mean by "support"). By focussing on religion and sex as you have -
but, 72% of Americans, the believing Christians, would approve of such
admirable mainstream retraint of focus, I'm sure! - you seem to have
overlooked what Herodotus may have too idly called history, and the location
of poetry and language - and you - in it. (Personal anecdotes, and the
question of sexual harrassment in the academy -- these are separate threads
to me, here.) Anyway, I love the Corso poem that you posted the other day.

Thanks Stephen for the beautiful Whalen excerpt, too, and Pierre for the
news about that other Olson, etc.

Louis, here's a quick reply and not a very sound one -- I still support poetry
itself, but I wonder if I should have looked much further than the Beats.  I
love Corso's poetry, but what if I had worked on Edwin Arlington Robinson -- is
that his name?  I have spent so much time on fashionable figures stemming from
surrealism.  I'm quite curious now to see what other histories/perspectives are
available.   What is Ted Kooser up to?  I wonder what other windows I should
open on America before it's lights out at least for this reader.

George Lakoff was on channel 39 the other night with Tina Brown (ex-editor of
the New Yorker).  She has a neat show.  Very good academics come on but only for
one or two minutes, and present a tasty little idea, and then she cuts to a
commercial.  Lakoff said that the Democrats are matriarchal, and the Republicans
are patriarchal.  He was quite neutral about this.  He said that people vote
Democratic when it seems that they feel safe, because matriarchy promotes a
feeling of compassion and caretaking.  People vote Republican when they feel
scared, because patriarchy promotes a sense that a powerful father will take
care of you, and everything will tighten up.

All I could think was that the people in Spain voted opposite to his theory.
They got a train blown up and voted for their version of the Democrats, although
Lakoff's theory should have had them voting for their strong man.

Lakoff's theory is no doubt a lot more complicated, but it was fun to see him as
he's been mentioned on the list a number of times.  I'm sorry I don't know what
channel 39 is.  After Tina's show, Dennis Miller comes on with his dream team
that includes David Horowitz and some others.  That show is not as good as Tina
Brown's because she gets more surprising guests on, and they aren't always the
same.

Louis, I wish I knew what you meant by Herodotus' theory of history, but am very
glad you liked the Corso poem.  It's always been one of my favorites.  For some
reason, nobody ever mentions that one among his top poems, and it isn't in the
Collected from Thunder's Mouth.  Did you love the sound in it?  The imagery has
a very interesting "structure of feeling" to borrow a phrase that I remember
from my reading of Raymond Williams -- it goes from depression to joy, and uses
very subtle alchemical imagery to create an almost subconscious structure.

responding to louis c's typically elegant post:  i despair of the
mainstream, i don't despair, i despair, i don't despair, etc...

i'm not about to give up on a larger social platform... i don't think
you can get there via lutheran theology or by dismissing entire
literary movements b/c poet-instructors have sex with their students
(do i need to say this here?---but mea culpa, back when i was single,
and it's a complex issue of course... derek walcott hardly represents
a beat approach to literature, but last time i checked he had serious
sexual harassment problems, no?)...

will rogers might have said a few things that seem corny, overtly
patriotic, too wedded to common sense and the like to suit poets
suited to contingency... but he also said

Statistics have proven there are twenty five bath tubs sold to every Bible.

that is to say, he never forgot about the little guy, who gets bigger
and bigger when he joins up with more and more other little guys...
oh sure, you got a face in the crowd and alla that too... and it
would be presumptuous to think that we're "better" than our elders,
even if thinking we can't do better is, in its way, equally
presumptuous...

the way i see it there's a local and a global issue at stake in
"ginsberg"---the man, his values, his immediate effects as a man and
the consequences e.g. of his writings... i learned a long time ago
not to fall in love with an idol (which has, i hope, nothing whatever
to do with the bible)... but there is some justification in observing
that, while we continue to wreak extraordinary violence upon our
fellow sapiens, the environment, etc.---and may well be tottering on
the edge of an apocalypse---the social system, at least here on the
north american continent, has by and large also moved ahead a bit...

i wouldn't call it progress exactly...

no---maybe i would... with regression right alongside...

i wouldn't want to live in 1939, 49, 59, 69, 79 , b/c just e.g., the
status of ethnic minorities then was a helluvalot worse here in the
u.s., and i figure no man is an island, and alla that... i'm speaking
generally now (and in fact *my* status was a helluvalot worse e.g. in
1969, class wise, but i'll leave that one alone)...

no i don't think the little signs in everyone's lawn here in normal,
illinois---"support our troops"---amount to a positive sign of the
progressive times... not by a long shot... but the folks in most of
those houses, if i may---and i'd bet a substantial sum here---are
probably a lot more "enlightened" as to gays and women's issues and
minorities (sorry), on the all, than their counterparts were in
1959... there are some aspects of their behaviors and beliefs (please
pardon the condescension here as the little jack-boot sociologist
pops out of me) that probably leave a lot to be desired, sure... and
make me wish, at times, i were someplace else... ditto for my own
residual sexisms and racisms (etc.), which make me wish at times i
was someone else... but give me another half century, at best, and
i'll be six feet under...

which is to say, the world moves on...

but i think you gotta give some credit to ginsberg and others when
you think about public consciousness here in the u.s.---his
incremental contribution to the real... which is not to wish away the
damage he may have done (like me), by e.g. sleeping not only with the
dictionary, but with his students... or b/c his words had
unanticipated effects... i'm not suggesting either that to sleep with
one's students must be interpreted only in terms of damage done...
and i can't see how anyone could read ginsberg's writings in such
terms, either (and i say this despite the fact that the beats often
provide, for me, a real obstacle to overcome, generally speaking,
when i teach creative writing---if you know what i mean, and pace the
beats)....

which makes me want to ask, as i have so many times on this list,
what are we doing here, together?

best,

joe

His place in history

By Dinah Cardin
Friday, March 19, 2004

He was one of the most influential poets of the last century, and
Gloucester was his main muse. Now, a filmmaker wants to make sure
Charles Olson's legacy lives on in his hometown.


A cast of characters far from whom you would expect to see actually
dirty dancing, much less at a movie about the act, recently turned up
for a premiere screening of "Dirty Dancing: Havana Nights" at Lowe's
Liberty Tree Mall Cinema in Danvers.

The crowd appeared middle aged, educated, quite socially conscious ...
oh, and was there to shell out $30 a head to support a documentary film
about a poet. OK. That's more like it.

The sneak peak at the new dancing movie (sans Jennifer Grey) produced by
Gloucester's Sarah Green, who also produced "Frida" and "State and
Main," was to help her good friend, Gloucester filmmaker Henry Ferrini,
with his latest project, "Poet & The City," a film about poet Charles
Olson and his connection to Gloucester.

Though Olson was one of the key literary figures of the last century,
Ferrini says he is hardly known in his beloved Gloucester. Olson, who
died in 1970, had a real interest in a sense of place -the focus of many
of Ferrini's films. Olson seemed to "change the landscape," Ferrini
says, with his writing. His masterpiece, "The Maximus Poems," is all
about Gloucester: "The geography which leans in on me, I compel
backwards I compel Gloucester to yield, to change."

National Public Radio called his epic piece one of the top 15 poems of
the 20th century.

Educated at Wesleyan and Harvard, Olson's work inspired other great
poets of the '60s, such as Allen Ginsberg, and though he wasn't exactly
in New York or jotting his impressions of trips cross-country, they
called him "the big fire source." Though it often takes a dictionary and
encyclopedia on hand to understand much of his work (an accompanying
guide to the "Maximus Poems" is 800 pages), it is important that the
people of Gloucester come to appreciate it, says Ferrini.

One of his greatest achievements was his research and writing about
Herman Melville. Olson was able to collect 100 of the original volumes
that had been dispersed from Melville's library, and in deciphering his
scribblings from the margins was able to put together a whole new look
at Melville's thinking behind "Moby Dick," particularly evident to Olson
in Melville's notes on Shakespeare. From this came Olson's work, "Call
Me Ishmael."

"Only poets sort of understood him. He was a language guy and you need a
couple of Phds to understand him. The connection with Olson for me is
he's such a large character in this town that nobody knows anything
about, and I find that to be really intriguing," says Ferrini. "I know a
heck of a lot more than a lot of people in this town. But I'm still
learning a lot. I want to make him accessible. I'm hoping to create a
window so the viewer can get a sense of what he was about and a sense of
how he interacts with the place. Gloucester was a major force in his
writing. If I can make a film half as exciting as some of his poems, I'm
doing OK."

To help create that window, the film will include sometimes very
intimate audio recordings and films of Olson reading his work.

Ferrini is nephew to Gloucester's poet laureate, Vincent Ferrini, who
was friendly with Olson.

In 1957, after a long hiatus away, Olson wrote to Vincent Ferrini from
his new apartment at Fort Square: "I return to the city and my first
thought, Ferrini, is of you who for so long has been my body here and I
a shadow coming in like gullsh-."



Back to school

Olson was trained as a scholar and taught at Harvard in the '30s. He
gave John F. Kennedy a C in his class, remarking he hadn't yet learned
to express himself.

In addition to being an academic, Olson also had a political career.
After Harvard, he went to work for the office of war information as an
analyst and had a high office in the Democratic Party. He was considered
for the position of postmaster general before working as a New Dealer
during the FDR administration. He later served as rector at the radical
experimental Black Mountain College in North Carolina.

When the college folded, he came back to Gloucester to complete his epic
work before he died of liver cancer at the age of 59.

Ferrini often finds himself on projects about writers and poets. He paid
tribute to his uncle in "Poem in Action," and in 2000 released "Lowell
Blues," a film about the blue-collar city seen through the eyes of its
most famous beat poet. True to Jack Kerouac, he included an original
spicy jazz score and readings from several powerful voices, including
Johnny Depp.

The filmmaker is working with Gloucester educators so that the Olson
piece may one day be as useful a teaching tool to the community's
children as "Lowell Blues" has been to the children of Lowell, so that
young students may truly understand the legend others will be
associating with their hometown for the rest of their lives. He has
already received a grant from the Essex National Heritage Commission to
help create the teacher's companion to the Olson film.

"Maybe some kids read some Kerouac, but now every one of them gets a
taste," says Ferrini. "I'm sure in 50 years it would still be used if
there's a teacher who is interested in poetry and how poetry informs the
places where we live. And that's also why Gloucester people realize that
Olson is an untapped treasure and resource and one that really needs
addressing. It will have a broad-based public television airing, but its
real evergreen use will be at the Gloucester High School."



Read it by reading

There are definitely those who would like to see this film completed.
Olson's son, Charles Peter, lives in Gloucester, and so do many of the
members of the recently formed Charles Olson Society, created in
conjunction with the international version in British Columbia, to form
awareness of the poet's life and work. The society considers fund
raising for the film and seeing its completion its top priority. The
film is going to do two very important things, says Peter Anastas of the
Olson Society.

"It's going to show people who Olson was and what his contribution was
to American literature, but it's also going to show how you live in your
own place," he says. "What does it mean to love the place you live in,
to make your life in it - the importance of place in all of our lives.
It goes right back to the founding of America, Plymouth, Gloucester,
Salem. They were extremely important to the people who founded them."

Anastis agrees that Olson is a "difficult" poet, but says the writer,
whose defense was simply that that was the way his mind worked, teaches
us how to read him.

"If you jump into the poetry and stay with it, you will learn how the
poetry works. You don't have to start at the beginning. You can jump
into the "Maximus Poems" anywhere. You can go forward. You can go back,"
says Anastis. "You learn to read Olson by reading it. The personal is
there, the historical is there, there's geography there and it all comes
together as kind of a mosaic and that's how Olson wrote."

Though he stood 6-foot-8 and weighed 265 pounds, perhaps it was his
desire and ability to live as a real resident of the town that made
Olson's achievements slip beneath the radar.

"(Gloucester residents) should know that a major American poet lived in
their midst a very ordinary life, going to the store, going to the post
office, walking in the streets," says Anastas.

"An absolutely major American poet lived in their midst," he stresses.
"He was like the conscience of Gloucester, writing letters to the editor
about saving this and not letting that go, about understanding the
importance of Gloucester and saving the wetlands."

Of course, Olson hated writers' societies and blasted the Herman
Melville Society in 1951 when it invited him to join its members in
celebrating the 100th anniversary of "Moby Dick."

"It's extremely ironic that we have founded the Charles Olson Society
when Olson hated the Herman Melville Society," says Anastis.

Yet, the Melville Society, Olson believed, was comprised of teachers and
scholars who were using Melville to advance their careers. The Olson
Society is not an academic society, but rather to help people understand
what Olson was about and bring poetry into their lives. And not just
Olson's poetry, says Anastis, but all poetry.

"It's really to try to help people understand the importance of Olson
and the relevance of his ideas," he says, listing among them the dangers
of greed, concern for the environment, historical preservation and
remaining connected to one's home and history. "And those ideas are
extremely important today."



'Dirty' money

Ferrini was always making plans to do a film about Olson. The interviews
got jumpstarted back in 1995 when several admirers and colleagues were
in town to speak on the poet during the Charles Olson Festival in July
of that year. Ferrini got out his camera and began gathering the stories
right there.

But despite the recent surge in interest for poetry, with slams and
readings and even the popularity of online publishing of one's own
verse, Ferrini has been on a rocky journey to fund this project. He
found that doing the award-winning Jack Kerouac thing, now seen in about
15 countries, didn't hurt. Still, the filmmaker laments that the
ever-popular Kerouac contemporary Ginsberg is no longer around to make
his contribution to the documentary.

"He was a close friend," Ferrini says. "I think if I had him in the can
it would have been a lot easier to get the film made."

Still, using television and film is a wonderful way to grow the audience
for poetry, he says. He walked away with about $6,500 from the "Dirty
Dancing" screening benefit, and hopes to complete the film, currently
still in production, by April 2005 to premiere it at the Cape Ann
Historical Museum in Gloucester for National Poetry Month.

With many films under his belt, Ferrini is used to this routine of
working on the good stuff while the funding is there, even with
occasional help from research assistants when the money holds out, and
then setting them aside to do commercial work to pay the bills. In 1990,
he completed a film called "Radio Fishtown" about Simon Geller,
Gloucester's stubborn, eccentric and beloved resident, who was the last
one-man radio operation in the country, until it was bought out by WBOQ.
The film won Bravo's Hometown Video Award for Documentary Film by a
Media Professional and was broadcast on PBS affiliate WGBH.

He also made "Witch City," on one community's insistence on cashing in
on the events of 1692, as "a cautionary tale of what happens when
history is distorted by both merchants and would-be prophets."

As for the recent fund-raiser's odd pairing of commercial vehicle and
documentary film, Ferrini says he's simply grateful.

"It's great, because the pieces are so diametrically opposed," he says.
"It's sort of the ying and yang of the movie scene. That's sort of the
beauty of it. There's nothing that connects it except that Sarah Green
wanted to support a filmmaker whose work she believes in."

There's a second edition (2002) with a new subtitle

there's some fresh material there: perhaps something

I'm not sure if it has come up, but for those of you
interested in the Naropa Institute, you might want to
check out Sam Kashner's new book _WHEN I WAS COOL: My
Life at the Jack Kerouac School_ (2004). It's an
interesting first-hand account of the School of
Disembodied Poetics by its first student.

If When I Was Cool has come up, forgive me. I haven't
read all the Naropa posts as closely as I might've.

Of course this sort of labelling is beyond crude--Lakoff is trying for
something like a soundbite and not much more, and it's a bit astonishing
not merely to accept it as a serious position but to try to extend it.

But let's pursue it for longer than it's worth. If we accept that Aznar was
Spain's "strongman," perhaps Spain does fit the theory, and the division of
child-rearing labor is different in Spain than in Lakoff's version of the
US. Or perhaps Spanish voters are less likely than our compatriots to vote
with the emotion of the moment (I feel danger, I'll vote for the guys with
the links to Franco) and actually think about what they're doing with their
ballots, as even some of us do when we vote for people we wouldn't enjoy at
a picnic but are likely to support policies we also support.

Even that doesn't work all that well as a quick analysis. I would vote for
almost anyone other than Bush among other reasons because Bush and company
terrify me.

You might want to question your apparent assumption that other countries,
Spain in this instance, have "their version of the Democrats" or for that
matter the Republicans.

Back to Republican=-any "conservative" in any political context=strongman
vs. Democrat=any "liberal" in any political context= mommy: what would you
say about Chirac? Blair?

Here as elsewhere, you might want to question your terms.

the silent chorus moves quickly through the shuttle
we all behave the same with ropes and signs
swollen and melting are one and the same
the stars in their degrees distend the body
your place or mine your death or mine
watch this very short film
you will live inside it with everything you are

Call for Papers



MLA Discussion Group on Media and Literature



Program for the MLA Convention in Philadelphia (December 27-30,
2004):  "Lyric and Media"



How do theories of lyric expression, interpretation, and experience
intersect with theories of media? Does a focus on the lyric compel us
to rethink the narrative orientations of many discussions of the
literature-media nexus?



Possibilities include: lyric poetry in its media ecologies, from the
alphabet or ideogram to the Internet; lyric, song, and sound
recording; lyric and electric or electronic media; lyric and
film/video; lyric and the dynamic generation of the page.



Please send abstracts, along with requests for any audiovisual
equipment needed for the presentation, to rmenke@uga.edu by March 25.
(This program topic has been approved.)

DRAFTING <a right of first refusal>

basically it ll be something
                                perhaps akin to duchamp's box
                                or neil diamond's box set
hopefully between somewhere--there is no one aesthetic other than the
aesthetic, or if you d prefer, all aesthetics point to one aesthetic
so, as ivan says, 'all is permitted'

anything may be submitted cd's. lp's. visual works. writing. math.
pictures. money. but please keep in mind that for this first one, i'm
gonna be mailing them out 'on my own dime', so postage/weight/should be
considered, otherwise only people in my vicinity will be able to have
their very own artistic sisyphus boulder

it works this way; send 10 submissions multiple 'one of a kind' or
micro-produced and then after 10 submissions have been received, an
issue appears i'd even take pop tsongas

realize that it 'taint precious so if your submission makes great
wrapping paper, it may be used as such, but please, take it easy, this
should be enjoyable

ideally, then, a month or two passes and a 'release' 'launch' or,
better yet, brunch will be scheduled somewhere and we'll have a thing
(the switch from the first person singular, to first plural marks my
good intentions)

either email questions kmthurston@hotmail.com

Buffalo, North Campus. Speaking across a broad range of cultures,
disciplines and concerns, Alcalay discuss how his immersion in a diversity
of languages, scholarly research, writing poetry and prose, translation,

poetry has a means of conveyance: of experience and knowledge, of ideas, of

John Brandi is an artist and poet, author of thirty-six books of poetry,
including Heartbeat Geography: selected and uncollected poems 1966-1994 and
most recently, In What Disappears, both from White Pine Press. His paintings
and collages are in collections worldwide. In his introduction to John
Brandi's Heartbeat Geography, Scott Nicolay likens Brandi's poems to
footprints: they are at once traces of his travels and evidence of the
slight division between his body and the land. These "footprints" range from
free-form lyrics with simple refrains to the seventeen loaded syllables of
American haiku. He writes of God and gods, lust and love, the dignity of
conch diggers, goatherds, peach pickers, stowaways, believers, breakdancers
and the newly born. His observations reflect his ever-changing surroundings,
his growth and age, the political moment, his affirmation of adventure, and
always, his Whitmanian love of the whole untidy mass of experience.

Downloadable reader's guide is available on the Just Buffalo website under
"World of Voices."

So You Say You Can't Write Poetry? with Marj Hahne
Three Wednesdays, March 24, 31, 7 - 9 p.m.; $100, $85 for members

As children we were natural poets, but by adulthood, we likely suppressed
some of the sensibilities that enliven our reading and writing of poetry:
(1) a fascination with wordplay and the infinite possibilities of language,
(2) an alert sensory perception, (3) recognition and acceptance of our
unique voice, and (4) patience with our learning process. Designed for the
beginning or tentative poet (although practiced poets will find it
enriching, too!), this educational and fun workshop will present accessible
poetic forms, sample poems, and prompts as structures that allow for the
possibility of poetry as we uncover or recover our individual poetic voices.
We will create a safe space for generating lots of original writing while
attending to the particulars of craft: language choices, the poem's shape,
and various poetic devices.

Marj Hahne is a poet and teaching artist from New York City. Her work has
appeared in Painted Bride Quarterly, Mad Poets Reviews, La Petite Zine,
Rogue Scholars, & New England Writer's Network. She also has a CD entitled,
notspeak.

Subject:      Martin Luther is a fink
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="US-ASCII"
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

Well, folks, I stand corrected regarding slander and libel of the dead.
Let's see: Martin Luther is a fink (he sold the poor down the river in the Peasant
Wars).  Jesus is a two-bit provincial rabble rouser (see Josephus).  Emperor
Constantine is a liar and a hypocrite (the Holy Cross above the battlefield,
my foot!).  And so on.

Time for me to take a break from a listserv that is less and less about
*poetics* and more and more about some truly boring version of the so-called
Culture Wars.

But before I sign off, let me state (once more, with feeling!) the following:

The Trungpa / Merwin fracas, amply documented by Ed Sanders, who for many
years since has been a cherished visiting professor in the Jack Kerouac School's
summer program, had *nothing* to do with the (then) Institute and even less
with the Jack Kerouac School.  The "Regent" Ozel Tendzin's unfortunate hubris
had nothing whatsoever to do with the Jack Kerouac School.   To try to smear one
of this country's most innovative, eclectic, and engaged schools of writing
and poetics by harking back to those endlessly regurgitated "scandals" is
gratuitous, pointless, and frankly, repellent..  For almost twenty years, the Jack
Kerouac School of Disembodied Poetics has been the Writing and Poetics
Department of a fully accredited non-sectarian liberal arts instution, and the
achievements of both its alumni and its faculty speak for themselves.

I salute Mark Weiss, C A Conrad, and others who have patiently stood their
ground against Kirby Olson's neo-con religionist polemics.  I appreciate their
efforts to try to convert him to some form of rational discourse, but I fear
that Olson's debating tactics have revealed themselves to be those typical of
right-wing bait-and-switch demagoguery (of which I am old enough to have had
some experience).  When his outrageous (and often ill-informed) statements evoke
an irate response, he immediately accuses the responder of not having a sense
of humor.  Since it appears unlikely that he will either 'wake up' or take his
clown act elsewhere, I will, for now, devote my time to more productive
pursuits.

Anselm Hollo

Ah, Anselm. You've said what I have been fearful to say. Poetics=Culture? Not on this list. Although everyone has been helpful towards my studies. But then again, so much Springer Culture.

Even if I ask for Cash. cash.

Yes, I think that if you put Ginsberg! into the places where he puts Moloch! you
would have my version of his poem.

Ginsberg whose eyes are a thousand blind windows!
Ginsberg whose love is endless oil and stone!
Cocksucker in Ginsberg!  Lacklove and manless in Ginsberg!
Ginsberg who entered my soul early!
Ginsberg who frightened me out of my natural ecstacy!
Ginsberg whom I abandon!
Wake up in Ginsberg!
Light streaming out of the sky!
Ginsberg!  Ginsberg!  Robot apartments!
They broke their backs lifting Ginsberg to Heaven!
Nightmare of Ginsberg!  Ginsberg the loveless!  Mental Ginsberg!  Ginsberg the
   heavy judger of men!

The pantheistic footnote with Holy everything.  It's a poem that appears to cast
evil everywhere and then says that everything is actually holy.  Very weird.
Very dangerous.  It projects all evil elsewhere, but his own vision is pure and
saintly?

I like the last lines, but they seem to me to come out of the Judeo-Christian
tradition, with a traceof Buddhist overlay..

Holy forgiveness!  mercy!  charity!  faith!  Holy!  Ours!  bodies!  suffering!
magnanimity!
Holy the supernatural extra brilliant intelligent kindness of the soul!

I'm not sure about supernatural, but the rest of it is ok with me.  He ends with
the tradition.  It sort of seems like the way Annie Finch pointed out that
Charles Olson's epic poem ends with a return to iambics.

Ginsberg is a locomotive in the brain.  He killed the best minds in my high
school.

Ginsberg whose fingers are ten armies!
Ginsberg whose breast is a cannibal dynamo!
Ginsberg whose ear is a smoking tomb!

I've thought this for twenty-five years.

I guess the question is: how then do you reclaim
public space that has been made unsafe? I found myself
several times in the position of wanting to quit the
list, most recently when Kirby made the comment (in an
aside to his main point) that raping boys was an
integral part of Arab culture; my distress was
heightened, I'm forced to admit, by the complete
silence regarding that remark. Thankfully CA Conrad
responded more vocally (and with appropriate
profanity) to the Ginsberg comment.

What do you do when all you feel like doing is
"quitting the list?" I mean, besides actually quitting
the list?

Some comments don't even deserve response I
suppose--but when a statement so patently outrageous
is made, we're almost compelled to get into a sandbox
discussion.

But many many people on this list seem not only to
tolerate, but also to respect Kirby and value his
contribution.

(Hence the silence at the raping boys comment?)

But these days--especially it seems--these opinions
seem not only uninformed, or naive, but actually have
real connections to real violence, that is: they
enable our agents (American government) to act on our
behalf in shocking, shocking ways.

The dehumanization of the Arab male made it possible
for the war in Iraq to be fought when it was, how it
was, and has enabled the occupation to continue
without seeming end.

Of course it is in a certain group's interest to
insure that dehumanization continues, hence the rules
against trafficking with publishers of Iraani works
etc etc.

I'm only trying to say that there is a connection
between individual violence (verbal or otherwise) and
state violence.

So there are all sorts of rules about "flaming" or not
"flaming" but the rest--the codes of conduct, the
level of discouse, etc.--is supposed to be worked out
by the community.

I know it is a strong and grave decision then to
"quit" the list--to take your voice (and your ears!)
elsewhere.

At the same time--if I do stay on the list--when will
I get weary of being a "defender"--and let shocking
comments slip away: this happened during a discussion
of few months back speculating on a certain poet's
sexuality and/or religious affiliation based on
evidence of the hairstyle in her authors' photo--a
comment that was at best way bumpkin-naive and at
worst shocking homophobic unintellectual discourse.

So I don't know what's best for me. I'm worn out, in a
sense.

On Naropa University--

I wanted to mention that all the talk of whatever Allen G did or did not
say, or did or did not do DECADES AGO draws attention away from what the
Jack Kerouac School of Disembodied Poetics has become. It is an educational
place where one can learn more about what is up with contemporary
experimental poetry and the writers that led up to it (not just Beat, but
Black Mountian, Language, New York School first and second generations, San
Francisco Renaissance, etc etc) than any other place that I have yet found.
    I think at Brown, SUNY Buff and New School they seem to have a lot of
exposure to this stuff too, but I haven't been to those places.

I came to Naropa in 1995 as  a student, got an MFA, then  coordinated the
Summer Writing Program there for many years.  I can say honestly that I
never slept with ONE of my teachers nor did I feel abused by them. I WAS
however grateful for much of their shared knowledge, and learned a lot by
watching and listening whether or not I consider individuals always
upstanding ethically or not.

There are abuses of power where ever there is power, in all sorts of
institutions.  Church, State, and the Arts.  That does indeed suck and I
have run into that myself pretty severely at times.
    BUT I for one am immensely grateful for having been able to spend a lot
of time in a place where MY GOD they  talk about POETRY EVERY DAY, and
believe that it is important, and imagine that life as a writer might
actually be something to pursue-------  That's what I take away from Naropa.

I am MUCH more interested in WHAT people are making, creatively and
intellectually, than ...the rest.

Best--

Thanks for saying all of this, Anselm. For a longtime now I have not
understood the - perhaps missionary good willingness - to baby sit and
coddle Mr. Olson's chummy commitment to what on first view appears as
intellectual density -which in actuality is a thinly disguised commitment to
and alignment with a very bigoted mindset the strategy of which - in the
guise of intellectual proposition and query - has the consequence of
draining this list of productive exchange, let alone clogging it with smears
and hateful drek. For months I - and I assume many - have taken the sight of
KO as a trigger to hit the delete button. Otherwise - similar to one of
those black holes in space that suck up real stars - the list becomes a
witness to an endless drain on smart energies best spent elsewhere.

Personally, Anselm, I would like to see you stay on the least, both as an
ear and a contributor. Though for several months I have found much more in
the way of "discourse" on many a blog (or going to and talking after poetry
readings), I think this list - as a broad public forum - is important to
maintain for the health of writing, community, etc., (including the many,
many lurkers) - minimally as an agora for announcements, but also as a pulse
where the well can be stirred, and arguments can begin.

In the fifties, when I was in a high school in a town with no small
percentage of evangelicals, there was a student, Sammy,  who used every
class to raise his hand, stand up and praise the lord, talk about getting
born again, what the Russians, those communists had coming our way, those
fellow traveler students and commies up in Berkeley, and homosexual poets in
San Francisco, etc. etc. and we were getting closer to closer to getting
invaded.  Most frequently, to survive the tirades,  the teachers would put
him out in his own chair in the hall way where he could read the Church
pamphlets he carried in his binder. As students we were relieved. We wanted
to get on to other things besides his Churchand other attitudes. One day he
made a near fatal mistake. He let go on a tirade about the "race problem"
and what those "dirty Negroes"  were doing to the town - this is in a school
that was about 40% African-American. After school, kids who saw his face,
before he got put in the ambulance, said he didn't look good at all. That
was back in 1958.

just to say, i've wanted to get off this list countless times myself,
esp. over the last (stormy) six years... the last year or so though
has been esp. tough, as conversation has devolved into insinuation
and some really loony declarations... if i want that sorta thing, i
can turn on o'reilly or listen to rush or read l. ron hubbard... i
think what keeps me subbed now is force of habit more than anything...

in my last post i asked rather pointedly what we're doing here
together, b/c it seems to me that we're at another of those
collective turning points... last time this happened, the list (some
of you will recall) melted down, only to be resurrected in its new &
not necessarily improved format... is it ok to say that feelings were
hurt?...

feelings were hurt...

there's a line that's crossed---and please don't anyone ask me to
delineate it---when one goes from challenging the perceived status
quo to crank... apparently not everyone here knows the difference
between a rebel (with or w/o a cause) and a crank... and it only
takes one crank to spoil everyone's fun, even with the delete key,
b/c we are after all social beings, and sooner or later someone will
post something (or enough of something) and we'll be in over our
heads...

don't know what else to say other than that i come here to learn, in
part, and in part to get to know others near and far, and that i
still think the correct m.o. on lists such as these is summarized in
that little phrase, "in good faith"... there are certainly more and
less performative ways to approach this space, too, and we can
certainly have some fun here too...

but as i'm now anticipating someone to post in to explain to me, or
rather, to insinuate just how presumptuous i'm being and how faulty
or passe my sense of things is, well---

you get the picture, most of you...

best,

Julie:

Bravo!
 Certainly to poets, Naropa remains a very important institution.
Now let's talk about poetry everyday on this list! I think it has drifted
away from why it was founded. If one wants to discuss politics or religion,
at least approach it with poetics in mind.

Kirby:

If you want to discuss Allen Ginsberg's sex life, at least discuss with
reference to his poetry.

As mainly a lurker, and a recent one, I  have found it interesting (in an
anthropological sense) to read some of the stuff here.  Though I admit,
lately I've been too busy with other things and have mostly been pressing
that delete button.  I begin to understand better the full-on reaction some
people have against religion.  I come from a secular country (Australia)
where church leaders of all stripes mainly confine themselves to public
comments about social justice for the poor, for refugees, and the
inadvisability of pursuing aggressive wars: and we don't put God on our
money.  (We have our own problems, of course).  So I guess it's been
educational for me, especially considering our government has now tied us,
economically and culturally, ever closer to the States.

I'm kind of with James Kelman when he says that bigotries are a product of
faulty artistry. And given a wide acquaintance with human frailty, including
my own, I've been surprised by some of the racist/bigoted comments: Kazim, I
started an outraged mail about the male rape canard, but I deleted it; I
felt too tired.  Mea culpa.  To various peculiar macho expressions of US
triumphal and various misogynist/racist comments, you might add the
homophobic equation of homosexuality with paedophilia. The feminisation of
the Semitic male (Arab and Jewish) is of course a long tradition of Western
power politics; and underneath that, you might ask why a man has to be
feminised to make him less than human.  What does that say about what women
are in this culture? And so on.  But yes, you get tired, since in the end

Kazim,

I think the main reason no one defended Arab males from Kirby's nastiness is
that everyone sensible deletes Kirby's messages without reading them.
Another reason might be that people (such as myself) with little first-hand
knowledge of Arab culture are not the best people to refute this kind of
thing.  I am pretty certain that Kirby is wrong, but I don't have data to
support my case.

Incidentally, one literary source for what Kirby said might be Andre Gide.
He wrote a book (I forget which) about an older man's "love affair" with boy
in North Africa.  Of course the rapist, or at least statutory rqpist in the
story was a French man, but the bookk did justify such behavior in terms of
Arab culture.  I didn't buy it when I read it years ago, and I still don't
buy it.  It was rather disappointing to read such a thing from Gide, who is
one of my favorite authors (for Les Faux-Mannayeurs and Les Caves du
Vatican).  One would hope that great writers did not share the stupidiuty
and bigotry of the society they live in, but, alas, they do.

I regularly delete Kirby's posts without reading them.  On other lists to
which I belong, there are always one or two people who I delete without
event bothering to read.  I have learned to do this as a self-defense
measure.  If I clog my brain with statements that I find repugnant or
idiotic or, worse yet, I get goaded into responding and then going a few
rounds in debate -- well, I have little time and fewer brain cells to
waste.  I assume that this is a regular feature of any public forum --
there are some people you can't stand, and some debates not even worth
paying attention to.  I am willing to accept the ready delete for the few
nuggets of the genuine article of intellectual insight that, from time to
time, sparkle.  What else should I expect from a list?  I find out about
books, about blogs, about readings, and a few commentaries -- and I toss
out the crap.  Is there anything more to life that I'm missing?

Perhaps this whole discussion on Ginsberg could run under a header "Faut =
il
br=FBler..."=20
*
Here a rashly-translated {apologies to the god of translating tasks}
fragment from Ren=E9 Char's preface to an edition of Arthur Rimbaud
*
<<No one can tell us anything about them [poets] that would make them
intolerable and prevent us from approaching their genius. Saying this, =
we
don't even have in mind the play of just compensation that would show =
them
the same indulgence as to other mortals, depending on the alterations of =
men
and the savor of times.
Recently, they would try to prove to us that Nerval wasn't always pure, =
that
Vigny was ignoble on some boorish occasion in his old age. Before them,
Villon, Racine... (...). Those who love poetry know that _it is not =
true_,
despite the appearances and accumulated proofs. Devots and atheists,
prosecutors and attorneys won't ever have professionally access to it
[poetry]. Strange fate! I is another. The action of justice is put out =
where
poetry burns, where it has its place, where, for a few nights, the poet =
drew
warmth.>>  (from "Arthur Rimbaud", 1956)
*
{{As I am writing this, I see a man walking along the extended arm of a
crane, about ten stories up. Completely unprotected, apart from the
zig-zagging iron beams. Now he's sitting on top of one of them -- like
workers on that famous photograph of New York, having lunch on a =
foot-wide
framework of a building under construction. I know nothing about the =
man,
and, from where I am, cannot even make out his face. Perhaps he's a
molester, perhaps a saint. Now, he's alone, suspended over the street, =
over
the horizon of lake michigan, parallel to the trajectory of an airplane.
What fascinates is the fragility of the moment, the possibility of fall, =
the
steady assurance of the body.}}
*
There is hardly a poet of greater integrity than Ren=E9 Char.=20
*
Yet what are the conditions of poetry? =20
*
&, for us, readers, is it really a question of forgiveness (besides, on =
what
authority?)
*
Elsewhere, Ren=E9 Char says that he's not interested in men without =
flaws.=20
*
What if the flaws are really major? Like, let's say, supporting the =
fascist
regime, or, having sexual relations with disciples (Plato would probably =
see
nothing improper here). Should we just say, morality is a flavor of the
times, move on? Or delve into some unresolvable contradictions between
"work" and "life"?
*
Either seems rather narrow-minded.=20
Where does the conflict lie? Is it with the author or is it within us?=20
Why do we demand exempla for our morality?
*
&, on the other hand, can one be "immoral" and be ethical?
*
So, we demand that the poet be - - -.=20
(Why) do (feel we) we have the right to demand anything?
*
We demand the poet to be, say, pure...=20
&, at the same time, expect him to be exposed to all the dirt of the =
world,
we would chastise him for being locked up in a "poetic" bubble.
*
Are we demanding the poet to be a politician fulfilling a promised =
program?
A messiah fulfilling a/the promise?=20
Hypocrite lecteur.
Hypoth=E9tique lecteur.
*
And yet. Writing _is_ an ethical act.=20
Do the circumstances of writing diminish the fact? (Dostoevsky wrote the
Idiot -- perhaps the best condemnation of death penalty one would ever =
find
-- for money, just as he was pawning his underware, and perhaps thought =
of
nothing but a book that would _sell_. I am touched by the sparks of its
extreme beauty, by the badness of some of its writing...)
*
Please forgive me this fragmented, and rather incoherent message (I =
haven't
really put together my thoughts well here) . The topic itself is old as =
dirt
under your feet and as recycled. And, at the end, with equal lack of
coherence, let me echo Andr=E9 Breton's question opening a (morally, =
etc)
controversial story: "Who am I (following)?", & his remarks a propos
anecdotes on Victor Hugo, Flaubert :: to know that Flaubert's desire to
depict the color yellow was his motivation to write a book is to have =
more
insight than we'd gain from any exegesis.=20
*
Hence, my whole inquiry is necessarily fraught with contradictions.

Well, ok, I am one person on this list.  I suppose I should get off.  It's true
that I have a different pov.  I feel that I am completely alone with my
perspective and am trying to understand this.  30 years ago at Evergreen State
College already the female professors (lesbians) were having affairs with
students and nobody said anything, but if men did, it was rape.  There were
concerts in which only women could attend.  I said nothing.

Slowly what I feel is an extremely hateful culture has arisen.  I have said
nothing.

This list is probably the most notorious of all among people who cannot stand
this hate business.  And yet people on this list think that they are loving and
correct.  At least the people who write on the frontlist feel this.  On the
backlist I get dozens of messages from lurkers who have urged me to continue.
But since nobody else is joining in I feel that the argument is getting too
circular.  And it's now a waste of my time because I think I understand that the
collective paranoia of this board doesn't really want to be challenged.  That's
ok with me.

I wanted to try to understand it.  For me it was sort of like trying to argue
with the nuts on campuses who want to talk about the Bible.  I also wanted to
try to understand Ginsberg, and how he thought he could be almost a guru to his
generation, and yet demolish so many with his preaching in favor of drugs and
promiscuous sex. But Ginsberg is not going to have shadow, no perspective.  He
couldn't have done anything wrong.  He was a saint.  Ok, fine.

What he said is for the very strong, but a lot of other people were hurt.

What I wanted to do was talk about the very basic ideas behind poetry.  Afterall
it has seemed to me that poetry is now an illustration of what are really almost
retarded concepts.  But since nobody ever critiques them, and nobody will even
think that they are wrong, academia, poetry, and the left has become a very
provincial place.  As provincial as O'Reilly, if not more so.

When I post anything, it seems that only a caricature of my posts is read.  I
too said that I loved Naropa, and came away ahead of the game.  I do think
Ginsberg was a great genius.  I love his style.  I also love Pound's style.  I
don't know whose content is more off the wall between the two of them.  I love
his poems.  But I think the content is crazy.  The style is fascinating, and as
a snapshot of an era and a mentality, they could hardly be improved upon.  Sort
of like Robert Crumb's character Mr. Natural.  I do find it funny that people
still think there is something intellectually interesting in them.

At any rate, I discovered a lot by having these conversations.  I don't really
feel there is anything left to discover here.  So I will leave.  I don't want to
close the board down.  When I began on the board though I tried to get people to
discuss poetry.  There were only messages against Bush and Iraq.  I thought this
was nuts.

I've been on for a year, and the only messages Anselm has left have been to
attack me.  He's called me a neo-conservative and so on.  He's only replied to
my messages, as far as I can recall.  I didn't even know why I hated these
messages so much that took such a one-sided view of the war in Iraq, when even
many Iraqis feel that their future is going to be better.

Now, if the list moderator could take me off, or if someone could tell me how to
stop getting messages, I will leave.  I respect Anselm and his poetry (I think I
have made this clear) and if he and most of you can't stomach me, I will go so
that there can be perfect unanimity and harmony will reign once more.

Best -- Kirby

why don't you make a list to unpack for me (us?) how you understand
the "collective paranoia of this board"?...

not an explanation, mind you---just a thumbnail, grocery-type list... e.g.:

(1) cabbage
(2) pork chop
(3) old new left politics
etc...

i have had problems on this list, in the past and just to be clear,
with what i took (and take) to be

(*) overtly pacifist understanding of international affairs

or

(*) overreliance on poetics predicated on formal innovation

there---that's my #1 and #2... but that's just me, and i certainly
wouldn't characterize what i'm listing in terms of paranoia...

now, can you do the same?... and i mean, please to keep it concise, bud...

best,

i love naropa.  even though i could term certain of the faculty i
studied with as (heterosexual) predators.  it was the 70s.  this was
not unusual; the jk school was not an anomaly in this regard.  i do
not consider myself significantly scathed by the experience. in fact
i grew a lot.  i love naropa. and the jack kerouac school of
disembodied poetics.  when people on the list are cranks, i assumed
(is this overly codependent of me?) that they are mentally ill. now
this is not to say that everyone on the list who is mentally ill is a
crank.  but some people's mental illness takes this form.  i think
people shd be able to talk about anything they want, allen's sex life
included.  he sure talked about it.  i love allen; and i understand
that he is/was a mixed bag.  i missed the remark about Arab men
raping boys; often, i confess, my eyes glaze over and i reach for the
delete button when some folks post compulsively. other times i read.
i drafted a response to the allen/naropa thing but didn't send it.
others said what i was going to. xo to all --md

Wait... I haven't been reading this list for very long, but what, exactly,
is the "argument?"

If it's Old Values vs. New Values, then it is a waste of time. The concepts
are too codified in people's hearts to be discussed on an intellectual
level. And if I wanted to hear people dissolve all of philosophy into a
dichotomy which requires no more thought or introspection than picking a
side, I could turn on talk radio and hear obnoxious voices as well.

If your arguement is that "the point of view here is too homogenous," that's
fine, but the only way to counteract that is to introduce points of view
that others can appreciate. You claim that you've done that, but no one will
publicly admit it. I can appreciate how that would be frustrating, but it
seems to be untrue, just based on the Ginsberg discussion. Several people
offered that Ginsberg's behavoir was inappropriate. Most people seemed to
feel that your way of objecting to Ginsberg's behavoir was in poor taste,
but since you knew that when you posted it, I can't see why that bothers
you. I thought your argument was rubbish, but that's the point of a
discussion group, innit?

 In the past three or four weeks I've seen you tackle what I consider dozens
of seperate arguments. If your tactics enflame, I assume it was because they
were intended to. Do you really feel that everyone disagrees with you on all
these points, by virtue of being totally homogenous? Because that's not what
I've seen.

I think you are exaggerating. To the degree that you are not exaggerating,
you seem to be ignoring the fact that this problem is as old as poetry,
because fear of the Other is as old as humanity (at least). People very
often dislike those who disagree with them. If that makes you unwilling to
disagree, than you are not a poet. Both Ginsberg and Pound knew that.

It has been my experience that the left self-criticizes far more often than
the right -- Phil Ochs pops into my head immediately, but I could send you
notes from the leftist groups I work with. This list cannot provide a
complete picture of the left, academia, or least of all poetry. And your
characterization of this list doesn't seem to be really fair, anyway.

This seems to be an emotional reaction to current frustration, as evidenced
by the fact that you're misrepresenting your level of support. I think you
should take 24 hours and reconsider. I generally don't have a lot of
patience for people who leave and come back to a group every time something
happens they don't like -- it starts to feel like the same sort of crass
manipulation as repeated suicide attempts. But everyone's allowed one moment
of frustration, right?

I have even less patience for those who think they can discuss poetry
without discussing the real world (and that demands discussion with those
with whom you disagree). Although it seems to me you fight a lot of straw
men, I would still rather read about Marxism than rhyme schemes, and rather
read about Lutheran surrealism than the New York Times Review of Books. So
if you want to continue to discuss a wide variety of topics with those who
usually disagree, I'd appreciate it if you'd stay. If, in your mind, it
really has become a situation where everyone's picking on you because you're
different, don't let the door hit you on the ass.

Yours,

Poets Deborah Tall, Ogaga Ifowodo and Mario Hernandez will read from =
their work.

Mario Hernandez was accepted into the Writer's Workshop at Iowa in 1993, =
but declined to attend. He writes in Ithaca, has published in Prairie =
Schooner, and his self-published chapbook, Oblivion Diary, has recently =
been taught at Loyola Marymount University in Los Angeles.=20

Deborah Tall is the author of four books of poems, most recently =
Summons, which was chosen for the Kathryn A. Morton Poetry Prize by =
Charles Simic and published by Sarabande Books. She is also author of =
two books of nonfiction, The Island of the White Cow: Memories of an =
Irish Island and From Where We Stand: Recover=ADing a Sense of Place, =
set in upstate New York. She co-edited the anthology The Poet's =
Note=ADbook with Ste=ADphen Kuusisto and David Weiss and has edited the =
literary journal Seneca Review since 1982. Tall teaches at Hobart and =
William Smith Colleges in Geneva and lives in Ithaca.



Ogaga Ifowodo, a lawyer, holds an MFA from Cornell. He has published =
Homeland & Other Poems,  Madiba (Africa World Press, 2003), and Homeland =
(Edition Solitude, 1999), a German-English selection of his poems. He =
worked for eight years with the Civil Liberties Organisation, Nigeria's =
premier human rights group, and between 1997 and 1998 was held under =
preventive detention by the then military regime of Nigeria on account =
of his human rights activism; a memoir of his prison experience, an =
excerpt from which was included in the anthology, Gathering Seaweed: =
African Prison Writing (Heinemann, 2002), is in progress.=20

Kirby,
you are not a fink, neither are you a monster.  You are a man with a point
of view.  While I may not share that pov...and on several issues, I
don't...I do respect your right to hold that pov.

I married a person (does it really matter which gender?) with a pov...fact
of the matter is that is what I love most about that person.  And in truth,
having a pov is what I respect about most creatures I've encountered,
because, it has been my experience that those who have the courage to
maintain a belief...a point of view on an issue...were too those most
tolerant of others' pov.

And I abhore the clap-trap idiots who are too quick to criticize and equally
quick to shift their attitudes depending upon the current "acceptable" point
of view.  I have found most of these folks shallow, and intellicually mute.
I'm happy to be rid of them.

From my perspective as a reader on this list, I'd say you are one of the few
characters with a decidedly blatant and hard-nosed point of view...Kari
Edwards is another such, and while I don't know that person, I admire that
person's perspicacity.

You and Kari and others like you need to continue to prod, to prick, to
irritate to the point of pain here on the list.
Alex
Oh, Kirby, M.L. probably wouldn't have had the courge to continue to write
here on the list...I think he was a Christian milktoast who lacked the
courage to stand and be counted as a person.  He needed the strength of the
church as he defined it standing with him in order to have the courage to
take a stand.  pity that.  He was really brighter than the mass collective
of the clergy with whom he identified.

I thought these two poems - one from Charles Aexander and one from Beverly
Dahlen - kind of hit chords with me and maybe the list in the context of
recent "effusions of disgust."   On my blog I have actually written more
extended reviews of new books by both Charles and Beverly  -  if so
inclined, be welcome to take a look.

CENTENARY OF NERUDA: World-wide Programs Celebrate 100
Years of Pablo Neruda & Reading of “Heights of Macchu
Picchu” on Mountains in South America and Mt. Everest.

CONTACT: Ram Devineni, Program Coordinator at
1-212-723-4125 or devineni@dialoguepoetry.org /
Rodrigo Rojas, (Santiago, Chile) 56-2-676-2590 or
rodrigo.rojas@udp.cl

The writer Gabriel García Márquez wrote, Pablo Neruda
was “the greatest poet of the twentieth century — in
any language.” Dialogue Through Poetry, Rattapallax,
and Fundacion Pablo Neruda are helping to promote
literary programs around the world to celebrate
Neruda’s accomplishments and his role as a global
citizen.  Some notable events are occurring at the
John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in
Washington, D.C.; The Americas Society in New York
City; Jardim das Artes in São Paulo, Brazil; Auditorio
de Comfenalco in Cali, Colombia; and UNESCO
headquarters in Paris.

Working with poets and professional mountain climbers,
there will be readings of Neruda’s classic poem
“Heights of Macchu Picchu” on Mt. Aconcagua
(Argentina); Illimani (Bolivia); Chimborazo (Ecuador);
Mt. Everest (Nepal); the Andes in Chile; and Macchu
Picchu (Peru). Photos and/or video will be provided as
reference for each reading. The program called Neruda
on the Peaks is a continuation of the successful
Poetry on the Peaks program started in 2002 to
celebrate the United Nations’ Year of the Mountain
(IYM). The professional climbing partner is Alpine
Ascents International. The mountain readings will
coincide with the annual Dialogue Through Poetry Week
and UNESCO’s World Poetry Day happening the week of
21, March 2004.

In addition, Pulitzer Prize winner Yusef Komunyakaa
(Neon Vernacular: New & Selected Poems) and American
Book Award winner Martín Espada (Imagine the Angels of
Bread) will travel to Santiago to participate in
Chile’s celebration of their national poet on July 12,
2004. The event hosted by Rattapallax will be featured
at Universidad Diego Portales.

Martín Espada, called by Sandra Cisneros, the Pablo
Neruda of North American authors, says: “This
represents the fulfillment of a dream: to visit
Neruda’s Chile and to pay homage to the poet who has
most deeply influenced me, as a writer and person.”

A new documentary, Neruda! Presente! will also be
released this year along with several important
anthologies and new translations such as The Poetry of
Pablo Neruda edited by Ilan Stavans (Farrar Straus &
Giroux) and The Essential Neruda edited by Mark Eisner
(City Lights).  Rattapallax magazine will present a
special issue on poets and musicians influenced by
Neruda featuring work from Edward Hirsch, Marjorie
Agosin, Martín Espada, musicians Luciana Souza and
Marciano, and many others.

Lastly, to honor Pablo Neruda, a petition has been
submitted to the International Astronomical Union
(IAU) to name a crater on Mercury after the beloved
Chilean poet.

Funny how someone (was it that long ago?) was mentioning that the =
poetics list needs a good argument. Then we were privy to Augie =
Highland's Rumsfeld comments and I still don't know if he's entirely =
serious about all that...I guess he is. Hard to fathom.

Where's the Poetics?
I guess this list addressed poetry and poetics in the primordial =
past---in fact, the first few times I tuned in that was my first =
thought...Ok, now I'm a part of the Buffalo Listserv let's see what =
these brilliant minds have to say...nothing but partisan bickering from =
what I can tell. More and more in American society you are simply judged =
by what's in your pants...look everywhere people, the real issue has =
become morality...the gov't is about legislate legalized discrimination =
against homosexuals. Hence, AH's 'culture wars' comment. Why has this =
crept into most of the discussions on this list? It's an important issue =
true...what does it have to do with poetics. Everything and nothing. =
Perhaps people are finding this more interesting than poetics? Perhaps =
it has something to do with the long yellow streak of Puritanism that =
runs down the center of United States map?

Ok, I see that it's becoming fashionable to take some kind of "macho" =
stance on all issues anymore. What does Ginsberg's drunken or not so =
drunken lewd behavior have to do with his poetry? Are we supposed to =
discuss his poetics or his sex life or both, are they not separate areas =
(divided by a huge gray area)? To say that Ginsberg destroyed lives is =
ludicrous to me. Maybe he did, I did not know him. To say that his =
poetry did this alone seems silly. Kirby, this is obviously your =
experience with Ginsberg's work and the influence he had on you and your =
circle of friends. But Ginsberg's work (and Kerouac's and Corso's, etc.) =
had an opposite effect on me...it fairly liberated me from constrictive =
thought processes and convinced me that likeminded individuals walk this =
earth. I'm not saying that I agree with Howl, I'm simply saying that one =
can vehemently oppose whatever disgusting behavior Ginsberg was party =
to...and simultaneously critique and/or appreciate the merits of his =
work.

Kirby, you have, of course, the right to speak your mind. I think this =
is precisely the only quality of this list that makes it worthwhile. =
Everyone should speak up and out much more often.=20

Toleration and respect are not the same thing. The statement about =
raping boys being a part of Arab culture is patently absurd and =
completely offensive to me. I don't want my silence to be an act of =
complicity so I hope everyone sound's off on these points to reclaim =
some public space here. I think more discussion is the way to proceed =
here, not people jumping ship, so to speak. This list has become an =
important forum for me and its value is obvious.


<But many many people on this list seem not only to
tolerate, but also to respect Kirby and value his
contribution.>

Talk Series: Rahna Reiko Rizzuto
War, Words and Memory

Monday, March 29th, 8:00pm
The Poetry Project
@ St. Mark's Church
(corner of 2nd Ave and 10th St in Manhattan)
New York City

Rizzuto wrote her award-winning first novel, Why She Left Us, based on
interviews with Japanese Americans about their experiences in the interment
camps during World War II.  She was living in Hiroshima, Japan, to do
research into the atomic bombings for her next novels when the terrorist
attacks of September 11th unfolded.

She writes, "Language creates us, we use it to define ourselves, and then to
reflect that identity. In my writing and my research about life during war,
I have seen how memory shrinks and warps until it is no more than the sum of
the stories we have told most often, and our "true" experience, if there was
such a thing, has disappeared. In my talk I would like to explore the
poetics and the rhetoric of war, and the language of memory, as I
experienced them in Japan in September 2001, and as I saw them shape our
notions of ourselves, as individuals, citizens, and members of a global
community."

Rizzuto is the recipient of the American Book Award and the U.S. Japan
Creative Artist Fellowship.

All events are $8, $7 for students and seniors, $5 for members and begin at
8pm unless otherwise noted. The Poetry Project is wheelchair accessible with
assistance and advance notice. Schedule subject to change.

tub-thumper (TUB-thum-puhr) noun

   A noisy, vigorous promoter or speaker.

an impassioned preacher pounding away on his pulpit and you'll have a good
idea of how this word came to be applied to any fervent promoter of a cause.]

  21st Ezra Pound International Conference
Rapallo, Italy
July 4-7, 2005

The 21st Ezra Pound International Conference will be held in Rapallo,
Italy, Pound's home during most of his Italian years.  Sessions will
take place at the Villa Tigullio on the waterfront, near the Giardino
Ezra Pound, a small memorial pond and garden which Rapallo dedicated
to Pound.  Lodging will be in various Rapallo hotels, with meals
there or in other places at the discretion of participants, who will
have the opportunity to relax in the seafront Caff=E9 Rapallo, under
the balcony of  Ezra and Dorothy Pound's apartment in Via Marsala,
once the headquarters of the "Ezuversity." The registration and
opening session will be held in the Salone Consigliare of the Town
Hall, where Pound arranged concerts of music, and where the fiddle
score which is now Canto 75 was first performed by Olga Rudge.  There
will be visits to Sant' Ambrogio, where Pound lived with Olga, which
forms the background of some of his most haunting lines. Excursions
to nearby Pound places such as Portofino, Portovenere, and Zoagli
will be arranged. Among the highlights of this conference will be the
possibility of seeing, on the night of July 3 in the Gulf of
Tigullio, "the long boats set the lights in the water" as celebrated
in Canto 47.
Proposals are invited for papers on or related to the topic:

"Ezra Pound, Language and Persona"

Language and Persona (or Mask) are at the center of Ezra Pound's
work, from his first commercial volume, Personae (1909) to his last
Drafts and Fragments of Cantos CX-CXVII (1968).  The Anglo-Saxon
Seafarer, the Chinese Exile, Propertius, and Confucius, are only a
few of his major masks. ("Give a man a mask and he will tell you the
truth," as Oscar Wilde famously put it.) Pound also gave voice to
many goddesses and women, ancient and modern, introducing aspects of
language and gender. Other masks are his parodies of style, from the
vernacular to the Biblical, and his tireless exploration of
languages, Western and Eastern.  His heroes could be called "men made
out of words."

Committee:              Massimo Bacigalupo, University of Genova, Italy
                        Walter Baumann, University of Ulster, Ireland
                        David Moody, University of York, England
                        William Pratt, Miami University of Ohio

Papers should be timed for 30 minutes delivery and 15 minutes
discussion.  Proposals should be no more than a page in length, and
should be sent by Oct. 1, 2004,  via regular mail, air mail (outside
the USA) or email, to the Conference Secretary:

                        William Pratt

Anyone interested, with or without a proposal, should write to the
Conference Secretary.

Having lived in the Middle East for several years, my bet is that there are
more men having anal sex with their girlfriends before marriage - so the
girls will still be "virgin brides" - than there are older men raping
younger boys.  Although, too, there are bands of young men always walking
around arm in arm, kissing on the mouth.  But then, that's love.

Kazim,

I think the main reason no one defended Arab males from Kirby's nastiness is
that everyone sensible deletes Kirby's messages without reading them.
Another reason might be that people (such as myself) with little first-hand
knowledge of Arab culture are not the best people to refute this kind of
thing.  I am pretty certain that Kirby is wrong, but I don't have data to
support my case.

Incidentally, one literary source for what Kirby said might be Andre Gide.
He wrote a book (I forget which) about an older man's "love affair" with boy
in North Africa.  Of course the rapist, or at least statutory rqpist in the
story was a French man, but the bookk did justify such behavior in terms of
Arab culture.  I didn't buy it when I read it years ago, and I still don't
buy it.  It was rather disappointing to read such a thing from Gide, who is
one of my favorite authors (for Les Faux-Mannayeurs and Les Caves du
Vatican).  One would hope that great writers did not share the stupidiuty
and bigotry of the society they live in, but, alas, they do.

I am asking for you to take action against hate and discrimination. I
know everyone of you gives to your local food bank, your favorite
charity, your political organization, you volunteer and you recycle.


but for me it is simple, civil liberties should ever be taken away. and
here is in amerika, this regime is attempting to institute a policy of
hate and bigotry by playing on homophobic fears, by restricting
freedoms; freedom to have partners benefits, freedom to marry, freedom
to adopt, freedom to be out, and most of all freedom to love who you
want without fear of persecution or violence.  know just incase you
missed it since the this regime came into power hate crimes have risen
over 38%...

so I ask for your help in stopping this institutionalized hate against
lesbians, transgender, bisexuals and gays today. take a stand for
action for freedom . . . do not let them fool you in believing a second
class of citizenry is equal.. separate but equal is never equal!


how can you help..?
there are many ways I sure you already know of.. here are some others...

1. the first is call your local, state, county representatives and
demand legal right to marry for all. and demand no rights be taken
about including those of that include the GLBT population as a
protected class... which now I am sure you can see the reason that was
instituted and that is one of the first protections to disappear from
government jobs..


Identify and contact your elected officials.
http://www.congress.org/congressorg/home/

2. donate money... yes money is needed for not only the many legal
battle, and the advertisements lie those form HRC and the Log Cabin
Republicans, but just the day to day run of organizations. every time a
pamphlet is printed, every time a long distance call is made it cost
money; every time an organized protest happens it cost money, money the
petitions to send to congress... it all cost... this place need your
support.. please send what you can to...today

Joe, and everybody -- thanks so much for asking me to continue -- Alexander
Saliby, Larry Sawyer, Harry Nudel, Joseph Thomas, Joe Amato, and Ela K., whose
post didn't exactly ask me to continue to post, but did such wonderfully
brilliant inventive things with the last 24 hours of mayhem that I felt briefly
human again reading her amazing ins and outs.

Because I have decided to keep this post mostly about poetry I wanted to ask if
anybody else could see Ginsberg's Howl as a self-examination, with Moloch as
the negative aspects of himself?

I realize that the poem is largely self-mythologizing, and argues that a band
of nutty people in and out of mental asylums are actually great heroes to be
emulated, but in the Moloch section, if you replace Moloch with Ginsberg, you
almost get an exact readout of what Norman Podhoretz was saying about
Ginsberg.  Most of you probably know Podhoretz -- he went to Columbia with
Ginsberg and became a kind of bete noir for him.  Podhoretz started out with
the left but swung wildly to the right (I enjoy this kind of individual, as I
rather like it when people aren't stuck in one groove their whole life as they
smell less mouldy to me).

Podhoretz said that inside Ginsberg he was actually an extremely angry man,
filled with raw hatred, who took pleasure in tearing down western civilization
but had nothing to replace it with, and was the most violently competitive
person he had ever known.  This drove Ginsberg insane.  Ginsberg went to the
nuthouse after he had scribbled anti-semitic stuff on a dorm wall at Columbia,
and blamed it on the custodian (lovely thing to do).  I can't remember the
details.

I liked Ginsberg's Howl when I was 17.  I thought it was important.  Now that
I'm almost 50 it seems shallow and poorly conceived, and not very
self-questioning. Obvously he's a great writer technically, but I also think he
is letting a generation off the hook, and that's why he is really so
fascinating.   The gnostic vision that he had (the surrealists were quite
similar) is that there is a massive conspiracy against the angel-headed
hipsters who are being locked up and driven crazy by the infernal state.  The
idea is to drive back and forth across America like two-year olds on tricycles
going back and forth and never settling down or being responsible in the
slightest -- never having a family, or if you do want a wife having two or
three, and praising con artists and swindlers like Neal Cassady for having
broken "free."

Free of responsibility.  While that was probably appealing to teenagers like
myself, I don't buy today either the gnostic vision that America has nothing to
offer (if this was true why are so many people trying to get in here?), nor do
I buy the lack of responsibility to wives and children among this gang of
arrested development cases.

There is a fascinating and hilarious series of books by John Updike called the
Rabbit Tetraology which offers a Lutheran critique of the Beat experience.  It
begins with Rabbit, Run.  He is bugged by his wife, gets in his car and drives
west, man, like

To what extent does placing evil elsewhere, on to a system, or on to others,
allow us to be utterly irresponsible to our own families and communities?  If
we posit a good and loving God, on the other hand, we suddenly have
responsibilities.  It's a Copernican switch from love of kicks and thrills to
neighborliness.  It's a drag, true, man, like, but I think Ginsberg's gnostic
God allows him all kinds of license.  And it allows others license.

Ok, I was asked to be brief.  The collective paranoia of locating evil
elsewhere allows us to be irresponsible. I think this is the true source of
Ginsberg's celebrity.  He provided a roadmap to a licentious gnostic
libertinism that was very appealing but that wasn't good for the next
generation.  Nor, I would argue, was it good for the weaker members of their
entourage.  Not William Burroughs' poor wife, but his son -- born with a heroin
addiction.  Kerouac's pitiful alcoholism.

This is why I think a new myth -- not Gnosticism -- but Lutheranism -- has to
be developed to counter this problem.

I think Ginsberg's "Moloch" is definitely
America's monster, NOT Ginsberg's=20
"darkside."  I think the poem demonstrates
that when a society "projects" all its crap
out onto others, onto, for example,=20
"the best minds of a generation,"=20
then that society produces its Moloch(s).

I think that Ginsberg had his darkside, too, as=20
all of us do, to varying degrees, dependent primarily
on how much we engage in effective self-investigation
(something poetry writing and reading does NOT
always or necessarily supply).  Good psychotherapy
is in my firm opinion the truest and most reliable
form of self (and (significant) "other(s)") investigation.

I think that Ginsberg, himself, would have benefitted
far more from really good psychotherapy (only so much=20
of which was actually available at the time, it could be argued)
than he did from meditation.  No, "far more than" does NOT
mean "only by."  His meditation was good, too.  Another thing,
I read once was that he had gone to India and his guru said,=20
"You'd benefit even more by going back to America and interacting with =
people (as opposed to "zoning out into even further reaches of=20
isolation and self-absorption and Superiority,"=20
I suspect); now, that must have been
one wise swami, I'd say.

I love Allan Ginsberg's poetry.  His sexual promiscuity was ALSO,=20
probably, to some extent, a casualty (AND a blessing) of his times
(although I'm sure there were plenty of folks who were at least
"as enlightened as" Ginsberg, but NOT abusive or exploitative.
Also, I think we make a big mistake if we only revere "poets."

Blah blah, Steve

Karen Tei Yamashita is a Japanese American writer
from California. She lived for nine years in
Brazil, the setting for her first two novels,
Through the Arc of the Rain Forest, published in
1990 and awarded the American Book Award and The

Currently, she is Associate Professor of
Literature and Creative Writing at the University
of California, Santa Cruz. See her work at
Coffeehouse Press and the Cafe Creole.



(The following "intro" cribbed from Stephanie
Young's blog:)


[Brent] Cunningham's poetry is in ironic imitation
of the ancient rhetoricians-it is, in short, false
pedantry at its finest-"very well," he says, in
the Platonic accent, "this is the opinion of the
Athenians." Cunningham introduces to us a trope-a
bird in the forest, for example-and explodes its
possibilities as an image-object. He reminds us
that those who would claim that irony is dead are
fools. But-false pedantry aside, even in his
so-called "lectures to undergraduates," or
"explaination of thought for sheep," it is his
sincerity that draws us in.



While they profess a single subject, Cunningham's
poetry exists, as Plato's dialogues did, in
conversation with an accusatory public, an
imaginary audience with whom he argues, but also
in whom he finds himself mirrored: "My dear
Robert, said Robert (for we were both named
 Robert" Robert says to the second Robert, "please
go on, for your position fascinates me." Be
prepared to be addressed as "my friends, noble
listeners, narcissusts, bad businessmen, unsavory
actresses-lovers"

Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening
Breakfast is not where the day begins it’s where the most recent
disasters are served our furnace had a bilious attack last night from too
many excuses this morning’s furnace fricassee is fit for vegetarians
alone I do not smoke a pipe I get my highs from BBC for instance the
pothole in Uncle Demetrius’s brain dropping things on the table that
should have stayed inside perhaps to guide if not to enlighten Rumsfeld
nattering on NPR nevertheless so when I went for the MRI in Uncle Mete’s
stead they did go on about shifting angiomas shaking hands with the right
stabbed in the left I had to agree the left is wounded now for sure blown
veins of spirit I had not expected the political discussion but it seemed
wise to cooperate and they asked are you claustrophobic I thought Have a
nice day I said put me in the tube the wire grate two inches from my nose
no glasses there is nothing I want to see Rumsfeld I do not need to hear
inside his steel tube brain so give me CBC on your rubber earphones lest
you blow my head to smithereens like the furnace last night best of all
no watches here keeping time with thump thump bang no bombs no Rumsfeld
Brandenburg Concerto Number 6 is fine the trumpets tossing high notes at
the magnets thrumming all of them saying listen listen listen so it is
told by the journalist who invented his best interviews Rumsfeld
nattering on I can wait ‘til later the blocks to keep my head in line
quite useless the cringing is political not physical so if you could feed
me time to time six weeks would be fine in here far from silent furnaces
bleeding valves and Uncle Mete who died 80 years ago from a pothole in
his head drip-dropping things like mine

This post will be 75% poetry (not mine) straight from Ginsberg's Howl.  It is to
answer the charges that Morocco was not a pederasty center for the Beats.  I could

Things, and also on EWTN, the Catholic news station.  This isn't so much a
pedophile thing (the boundaries are very unclear) as a gay issue, therefore, is the
way it's being treated.

Someone else was trying to ask about that line.  I realize nobody reads outside of

I'm sorry again to upset those who don't like to deal with Ginsberg's poetry in all
its factuality or to think about the fullness of the legacy he's left.   The reason
that Burroughs was in Tangiers is that there was the possibility of screwing boys
legally.  This did not exist in America at the time.

Dear CAConrad -

Thanks for keeping me posted. Appreciate your concern and wish I could
respond at greater length. I am at the moment proofing Civil Disobediences: Poetics
& Politics in Action, co-edited with Naropa Summer Director Lisa Birman, a
wonderful collection of talks, interviews, documents from Naropa, to be published
by Coffee House Press this summer( Naropa's 30th anniversary) which includes
texts by Hakim Bey, Amiri Baraka, Creeley, Ted Berrigan,  R Duncan, Kyger,
Alice Notley, Barbara Guest, Beverly Dahlen, Samuel R. Delany, Robin Blaser, Alan
Gilbert, Sonia Sanchez, Pierre Joris, Bobbie Hawkins, a brilliant lecture by
Ginsberg entitled "Revolutionary Poetics" on Ackmatova, Neruda, others.  What
to say? Anyone who is at all serious & curious can & will look at the "record"
of the Kerouac school through the antholgies, documents, writings & teachings
of its amazing faculty & graduates over the years...We also have 7000 hours
and more of tape documentation of classes, lectures, panels, readings,
performance where the experiment that is the Kerouac school "speaks for itself". I am
so tired of being in a reactive mode with the neocon hegemonic pathological
dangerous crew that runs this country & dictates its agenda to others causing
lifetimes of suffering on this planet, that it's hard to meet the draw on this.
I was there at Naropa from the start - the point was to create an outrider
zone for the New American Poetics & beyond - with the compassionate backdrop of
meditative awareness & a vision for non-competitive mutually supportive
educational community. Like any human community there's struggle, mishaps,
mistakes, transgression etc...but I think that  it stays the course and does benefit
many creative beings of all ilks - we also have boundaries -like any
responsible university -  in place to protect our students and faculty from predatory
behaviour.

I see the trashing of Allen come and go -I see the demonization of
homosexuality and it makes me sick.  Allen was one of the most open & generous of beings
- his life  -his secret life-is an open book. There are no hidden dark crimes
that I know of.  I am the co-founder of the Kerouac school -I  worked as
assistent Dir & Director  of The Poetry at St Mark's before that -  I have
designed curriculum for 30 years  at Naropa  -There is ample proof of what it's all
about out there...I simply can't go on the defensive

You can pass this message on.  Many thanks & Onward!

Oh god, I swore I wouldn't, but here goes.

I'm sure some people on the list got angry at you because they disagree
with your conclusions. Some of us, myself included, however, got angry
because of the manner in which you reached those conclusions, which made
discussion impossible. For instance, I don't remember anyone arguing that
Allen and Burroughs didn't like teenage boys, and no one would claim that
Burroughs never slept with teenage boys in Morocco. What annoyed people was
your assertion that Arab cultures think that adults sleeping with teenage
boys is perfectly alright. In fact Arab cultures tend to be pretty
puritanical about most sexual practices. So a rather minor truth becomes in
your argument a major cultural statement, but when you're challenged you
retreat to the minor truth as if you'd never put the other forward.

Next. Burroughs went to Morocco for all manner of reasons, not least
because both living and drugs were cheap and because he had a taste for the
exotic. He certainly didn't decamp from the US for all those years just to
get laid by kids.

Note also that at the time he left all homosexual behavior was illegal in
the US, even if between adults. The recent supreme court ruling in the
Texas case was about the arrest of two adults.

Again, it's the manner in which your thought process works, taking you from
the ordinary to the extraordinary as if it were perfectly obvious.

You might note that when you shifted your ground to something like "in
those days professors, among them Ginsberg, felt much freer to sleep with
students than they do now" a lot of people on the list were willing to
engage without acrimony.

In the US homosexual activity between consenting adults has been declared
legal, subject to the definitions in the various states of age of consent.
For males this varies widely, but in most places it's 16 or 18. If the guy
is younger than that and his sexual partner, male or female, is over the
age of consent, he/she has committed statutory rape.

The church statistic you quote indicates only that a relatively small
number of ththose below the age of consent with whom priests have slept are
younger than 12. It doesn't speak to gender.

So the problem is that you generalize wildly from "facts" the boundaries or
applicability of which you haven't thought through or which are
questionable at best. Basically, if the factoid in question supports a
position you wish to expound it gets no further scrutiny--the position has
preceeded the evidence--and anyone who argues from knowledge finds himself
arguing against belief.

Understand that belief is neither knowledge nor thought.

How could you not have learned this?

Mark

I am prob. the only person on the listserv who was a novice and postulant
(For the Franciscans) and someone who worked with Priests and Sisters for
four years in Bolivia as a lay missioner and someone who believes in Gay
rights and also is a practising Catholic.

Many, of the Priests and Sisters that I have known in my life were Gay, and
99% of them never "predated" younger people, and most of them lived either a
celebate life or consentually gay life in secret.  They are great people who
live the Prophetic/Revolutionary religion of God far better than anyone who
writes in First Things. Many of the greatest voices of Catholicism were Gay
and they never hurt anyone and I vigorously deny that being gay makes one a
sexual criminal.

Having said this it takes a special kind of person to be a devoted Religious
and many of those characteristics and people are found in the Gay community.
Anything that appears in EWTN should be dismissed EWTN is a VERY
conservative, homophobic network, they will not air shows on such 'radical
catholics' as Pope John XXIII, Thomas Merton, Jacque Maritian, and Dorothy
Day. But they air stories on Cardinal Stepanic who helped murder Jews and
Serbs in Croatia during World War II. Try reading the assessment of the
Pedophilia report published in the National Catholic Reporter which is much
better and does not scapegoat gay people.

Hence, my Church's sexual problems are the result of a fact that we refuse
as a Church to realize that all people, created ,in God's image have the
right to love and be loved and that within our Church we have not dealt with
these issues. But to blame "homosexuals"for this is an insult to the great
Catholic homosexuals like Michelangelo, St Francesco of Assisi, and many
others.

Also, and this is just my opinion as well, there is plenty of perverse
behaviour by hetero sexual writers, just read a Henry Miller Novel.

I opened today a package sent to me a couple years ago by Tim Gaze to
find a wonderful vispo mag called ASEMIC chockful of curious
letterforms, calligraphy & abstract tracings.  This led me to the net
where I discovered another press I wasn't familar with, Broken Boulder
Press.  The best part about their website is the print these titles
yourself feature, with separate files for cover & insides so you can
print & bind the pamphlets yrself.  Every reader becomes a bookmaker.
Hard to argue against poetry with no middleman.

THOU SHALT NOT KILL
A Memorial for Dylan Thomas

I

They are murdering all the young men.
For half a century now, every day,
They have hunted them down and killed them.
They are killing them now.
At this minute, all over the world,
They are killing the young men.
They know ten thousand ways to kill them.
Every year they invent new ones.
In the jungles of Africa,
In the marshes of Asia,
In the deserts of Asia,
In the slave pens of Siberia,
In the slums of Europe,
In the nightclubs of America,
The murderers are at work.

They are stoning Stephen,
They are casting him forth from every city in the world.
Under the Welcome sign,
Under the Rotary emblem,
On the highway in the suburbs,
His body lies under the hurling stones.
He was full of faith and power.
He did great wonders among the people.
They could not stand against his wisdom.
They could not bear the spirit with which he spoke.
He cried out in the name
Of the tabernacle of witness in the wilderness.
They were cut to the heart.
They gnashed against him with their teeth.
They cried out with a loud voice.
They stopped their ears.
They ran on him with one accord.
They cast him out of the city and stoned him.
The witnesses laid down their clothes
At the feet of a man whose name was your name —
You.

You are the murderer.
You are killing the young men.
You are broiling Lawrence on his gridiron.
When you demanded he divulge
The hidden treasures of the spirit,
He showed you the poor.
You set your heart against him.
You seized him and bound him with rage.
You roasted him on a slow fire.
His fat dripped and spurted in the flame.
The smell was sweet to your nose.
He cried out,
“I am cooked on this side,
Turn me over and eat,
You
Eat of my flesh.”

You are murdering the young men.
You are shooting Sebastian with arrows.
He kept the faithful steadfast under persecution.
First you shot him with arrows.
Then you beat him with rods.
Then you threw him in a sewer.
You fear nothing more than courage.
You who turn away your eyes
At the bravery of the young men.

You,
The hyena with polished face and bow tie,
In the office of a billion dollar
Corporation devoted to service;
The vulture dripping with carrion,
Carefully and carelessly robed in imported tweeds,
Lecturing on the Age of Abundance;
The jackal in double-breasted gabardine,
Barking by remote control,
In the United Nations;
The vampire bat seated at the couch head,
Notebook in hand, toying with his decerebrator;
The autonomous, ambulatory cancer,
The Superego in a thousand uniforms;
You, the finger man of behemoth,
The murderer of the young men.

II
What happened to Robinson,
Who used to stagger down Eighth Street,
Dizzy with solitary gin?
Where is Masters, who crouched in
His law office for ruinous decades?
Where is Leonard who thought he was
A locomotive? And Lindsay,
Wise as a dove, innocent
As a serpent, where is he?
     Timor mortis conturbat me.

What became of Jim Oppenheim?
Lola Ridge alone in an
Icy furnished room? Orrick Johns,
Hopping into the surf on his
One leg? Elinor Wylie
Who leaped like Kierkegaard?
Sara Teasdale, where is she?
     Timor mortis conturbat me.

Where is George Sterling, that tame fawn?
Phelps Putnam who stole away?
Jack Wheelwright who couldn’t cross the bridge?
Donald Evans with his cane and
Monocle, where is he?
     Timor mortis conturbat me.

John Gould Fletcher who could not
Unbreak his powerful heart?
Bodenheim butchered in stinking
Squalor? Edna Millay who took
Her last straight whiskey? Genevieve
Who loved so much; where is she?
     Timor mortis conturbat me.

Harry who didn’t care at all?
Hart who went back to the sea?
     Timor mortis conturbat me.

Where is Sol Funaroff?
What happened to Potamkin?
Isidor Schneider? Claude McKay?
Countee Cullen? Clarence Weinstock?
Who animates their corpses today?
     Timor mortis conturbat me.

Where is Ezra, that noisy man?
Where is Larsson whose poems were prayers?
Where is Charles Snider, that gentle
Bitter boy? Carnevali,
What became of him?
Carol who was so beautiful, where is she?
     Timor mortis conturbat me.

III
Was their end noble and tragic,
Like the mask of a tyrant?
Like Agamemnon’s secret golden face?
Indeed it was not. Up all night
In the fo’c’sle, bemused and beaten,
Bleeding at the rectum, in his
Pocket a review by the one
Colleague he respected, “If he
Really means what these poems
Pretend to say, he has only
One way out —.” Into the
Hot acrid Caribbean sun,
Into the acrid, transparent,
Smoky sea. Or another, lice in his
Armpits and crotch, garbage littered
On the floor, gray greasy rags on
The bed. “I killed them because they
Were dirty, stinking Communists.
I should get a medal.” Again,
Another, Simenon foretold
His end at a glance. “I dare you
To pull the trigger.” She shut her eyes
And spilled gin over her dress.
The pistol wobbled in his hand.
It took them hours to die.
Another threw herself downstairs,
And broke her back. It took her years.
Two put their heads under water
In the bath and filled their lungs.
Another threw himself under
The traffic of a crowded bridge.
Another, drunk, jumped from a
Balcony and broke her neck.
Another soaked herself in
Gasoline and ran blazing
Into the street and lived on
In custody. One made love
Only once with a beggar woman.
He died years later of syphilis
Of the brain and spine. Fifteen
Years of pain and poverty,
While his mind leaked away.
One tried three times in twenty years
To drown himself. The last time
He succeeded. One turned on the gas
When she had no more food, no more
Money, and only half a lung.
One went up to Harlem, took on
Thirty men, came home and
Cut her throat. One sat up all night
Talking to H.L. Mencken and
Drowned himself in the morning.
How many stopped writing at thirty?
How many went to work for Time?
How many died of prefrontal
Lobotomies in the Communist Party?
How many are lost in the back wards
Of provincial madhouses?
How many on the advice of
Their psychoanalysts, decided
A business career was best after all?
How many are hopeless alcoholics?
René Crevel!
Jacques Rigaud!
Antonin Artaud!
Mayakofsky!
Essenin!
Robert Desnos!
Saint Pol Roux!
Max Jacob!
All over the world
The same disembodied hand
Strikes us down.
Here is a mountain of death.
A hill of heads like the Khans piled up.
The first-born of a century
Slaughtered by Herod.
Three generations of infants
Stuffed down the maw of Moloch.

IV
He is dead.
The bird of Rhiannon.
He is dead.
In the winter of the heart.
He is Dead.
In the canyons of death,
They found him dumb at last,
In the blizzard of lies.
He never spoke again.
He died.
He is dead.
In their antiseptic hands,
He is dead.
The little spellbinder of Cader Idris.
He is dead.
The sparrow of Cardiff.
He is dead.
The canary of Swansea.
Who killed him?
Who killed the bright-headed bird?
You did, you son of a bitch.
You drowned him in your cocktail brain.
He fell down and died in your synthetic heart.
You killed him,
Oppenheimer the Million-Killer,
You killed him,
Einstein the Gray Eminence.
You killed him,
Havanahavana, with your Nobel Prize.
You killed him, General,
Through the proper channels.
You strangled him, Le Mouton,
With your mains étendues.
He confessed in open court to a pince-nezed skull.
You shot him in the back of the head
As he stumbled in the last cellar.
You killed him,
Benign Lady on the postage stamp.
He was found dead at a Liberal Weekly luncheon.
He was found dead on the cutting room floor.
He was found dead at a Time policy conference.
Henry Luce killed him with a telegram to the Pope.
Mademoiselle strangled him with a padded brassiere.
Old Possum sprinkled him with a tea ball.
After the wolves were done, the vaticides
Crawled off with his bowels to their classrooms
     and quarterlies.
When the news came over the radio
You personally rose up shouting, “Give us Barabbas!”
In your lonely crowd you swept over him.
Your custom-built brogans and your ballet slippers
Pummeled him to death in the gritty street.
You hit him with an album of Hindemith.
You stabbed him with stainless steel by Isamu Noguchi,
He is dead.
He is Dead.
Like Ignacio the bullfighter,
At four o’clock in the afternoon.
At precisely four o’clock.
I too do not want to hear it.
I too do not want to know it.
I want to run into the street,
Shouting, “Remember Vanzetti!”
I want to pour gasoline down your chimneys.
I want to blow up your galleries.
I want to bum down your editorial offices.
I want to slit the bellies of your frigid women.
I want to sink your sailboats and launches.
I want to strangle your children at their finger paintings.
I want to poison your Afghans and poodles.
He is dead, the little drunken cherub.
He is dead,
The effulgent tub thumper.
He is Dead.
The ever living birds are not singing
To the head of Bran.
The sea birds are still
Over Bardsey of Ten Thousand Saints.
The underground men are not singing
On their way to work.
There is a smell of blood
In the smell of the turf smoke.
They have struck him down,
The son of David ap Gwilym.
They have murdered him,
The Baby of Taliessin.
There he lies dead,
By the Iceberg of the United Nations.
There he lies sandbagged,
At the foot of the Statue of Liberty.
The Gulf Stream smells of blood
As it breaks on the sand of Iona
And the blue rocks of Canarvon.
And all the birds of the deep sea rise up
Over the luxury liners and scream,
“You killed him! You killed him.
In your God damned Brooks Brothers suit,
You son of a bitch.”

I feel uncomfortable about the way certain other folks are feeling right
now, folks I know and folks I don't know but whose opinions I highly
respect, who have posted about what Kirby has said in the past (posts I
missed). Hope it's alright to be an irregular poster and lurker? I actively
participated in the last round of expulsions, years ago, and it was
exhausting; and since then, I've only read the list for announcements (and
when I've read for more than announcements, the reasons have had virtually
nothing to do with the quality of the posts [sorry!], but rather to do with
what-else was/is going-on in my life). I no longer have any expectations of
any kind concerning what this list might do or be (apart from a
dumping-ground of announcements) (once upon a time I did have hopes for
it -- I'm one of those who have been here for a long time). Sorry everybody,
I'm kind of bailing out, but I can't deal with this this time around (not
that I necessarily had much to do with it last time, in any direct way other
than as a list poster - but that seemed enough to wipe me out). Perhaps the
list moderator should step in, as someone suggested? I won't sign-off the
list, but I can't start re-reading old posts, like I did last time there was
a crisis. Best to all, Louis

this is the mating that triggered the war that killed all the people
the silent wings stirring up anguish, no one can take the blame
we are all innocent in our lives, we are all wounded
we will not eat we will live to do as much injury as possible
we will bring everyone to their knees, how dare they
we are the fury of the righteous and the violence of the lord
we are christ's burning, yahweh's drowning, allah's stoning
how dare we speak in the name of the truth
we are the murderers' fire and water and stone
one with annihilation
one with the world

Kirby,

Am I the only one to appreciate your keen sense of irony?

Your letting go half cocked off on Ginsberg is just the medicine you
received when you were doing your Ph.D., right?

You are revealing the hypocrisy in the-cohorts-of-English-Dept.-academia's
letting go half cocked off on the crimes of the whiteman's grave by using
their tactics in your Ginsberg lambast, right?

Do your really think his homosexuality adversely affects his poetry as
Pound's fascism does his? (Great poetry, but the latter was a moron and the
former a fag (a pitiful way of putting the whole thing, so revelatory of
that yellow Puritan streak as Sawyer put it so eloquently).

Matt

PS

Remember your bus driver disguise? When I started that thread about Spicer
in the CyberCafe of Exquisite Corpse? I was some nobody that you had to
condescend to by disguising yourself as a bus driver. But I was the dummy
because I took the bait, not knowing who you were. And who are you anyways?

Isn't the cyberspace so intriguing? Not at all like the C-Span camera that
studies the face of a Powell in the hot seat.

PPS

You are right about the Islamic religion, though. I know, I lived in Saudi
for a year. It struck me in the speech by the Iraqi ambassador to the US the
other night on C-Span who spot on she was. She used a phrase that many
foreigners have used who have experienced the oppressiveness living under
such circumstances, "sensory deprivation." Indeed, as she said, the Iraqis
have come out from under the pall of 35 years of that oppressive regime (and
not exactly of the same nature as the religious oppressiveness of Saudi in
its highly hypocritical aping of the role of the keepers of the Holy Shrines
of Medina and Mecca (the princes have their own private airport when they
return after drunken debauches in the fleshpots of Europe and Asia so the
Wahabbis and the average citizen won't see them)).

Check out the interactive macro/micro unfolding universe in "Secret Worlds:
The Universe Within":

http://micro.magnet.fsu.edu/primer/java/scienceopticsu/powersof10/index.html

"View the Milky Way at 10 million light years from the Earth. Then move
through space towards the Earth in successive orders of magnitude until you
reach a tall oak tree just outside the buildings of the National High
Magnetic Field Laboratory in Tallahassee, Florida. After that, begin to
move from the actual size of a leaf into a microscopic world that reveals
leaf cell walls, the cell nucleus, chromatin, DNA and finally, into the
subatomic universe of electrons and protons."

If you select "manual" you can click from universe to quark in seconds
flat. Puts life's problems in perspective (for a nanosecond, anyway) . . .
& gives fresh significance to Blake's

To see the universe in a grain of sand
And a heaven in a wild flower,
Hold infinity on the palm of your hand
And eternity in an hour.

Enjoy -

Different from or perhaps related to the quote
from Blake, another shortcut to the stars, or,
as today I happened to be reading :

There was an elderly retired
bootlegger in Newport 1955
who used to say, "I feel so
good, I think I cut my sus-
penders & go straight up."

from the a notebooks of Philip Whalen
Kyoto, 1969

Alison Croggon, hi, you wrote-
"  I begin to understand better the full-on reaction
some people have against religion.  I come from a
secular country (Australia)where church leaders of all
stripes mainly confine themselves to public
comments about social justice for the poor, for
refugees, and the inadvisability of pursuing
aggressive wars: and we don't put God on our
money.  (We have our own problems, of course).  So I
guess it's been educational for me, especially
considering our government has now tied us,
economically and culturally, ever closer to the
States."
Alison, Alison, Alison,
Aren't you forgetting your very own Victorian
archbishop Pell who is very vocal against
homosexuality and NSW's very own Reverend Fred Nile
who is lampooned every year in the annual Gay &
Lesbian Mardi Gras in Sydney.
This year Archbishop Pell's lesbian cousin & her
partner were given pride of place 9after dykes on
bikes) and lead the parade.
There are very vocal, public bigots & homophobes in
the churches here in Australia.
All the best,
Pam

Hadn't forgotten Pam - (_Cardinal_ Pell now, and member of a venerable
organisation which used to be called the Inquisition) - but also thinking of
the very Catholic Edmund Rice Centre and its activism say on the fate of
shadily deported asylum seekers - check out http://erc.org.au/

kirby,
I had the displeasure of sitting in a smoke filled cafe ( I think back on it
now and believe we called it a coffee house) in Greenwich village when I was
a youth and being subjected to the pains of having to listen to A.G.
read...though I can hardly call what he did reading.

For my money, I'd take Ted Joans any day of the week over A.G.  Joans had
both melody and drama in his words and in his delivery...A.G. had a kind of
pompous arrogance that overwhelmed his words during delivery.

A.G. was an angry man; what exactly he was angry about, I couldn't really
say, though I dare say, I could speculate, although I'd rather not.

I was a nobody then (ooops still am, for that matter) and in reality, A. G.
ten years or more my senior was too...though he appeared to be driven to
become a somebody.

To that end, I believe he succeeded.  His name is after all known in a great
many academic and artistic circles.  But too, I also believe he was more
concerned with his ultimate recognition and fame than he was with the depth
or quality of is work.  And keep in mind here, those words are my opinion,
undocumented by any of his words, though enriched by my having attended
several readings/performnces at which he delivered a message.

While it is true, Ginsberg has the recognition that makes him a poet of
stature in the country...perhaps even in the world, it is equally true to me
that he was a troubled and driven man and a very poor poet.
Alex

somebody ko/ing ginsberg, nn's occidental motherfuckers

i've wanted to write and quite unsure how to begin
none of us are safe from attack innuendo
there is no persepctive but the present which is always ripped apart

ginsberg's howl freed me then and frees me now
he was an outspoken jew among others and other things
he read with the force of the rav derrida deconstructing abomb america
i read him first at 13 then on and off forever

but the point of the hatred here after the fact and the era
coupled with anne's publicity blurb when something else was needed

and over there on syndicate nn seems self-immolating
whether she's a corporate entity on the run
or someone going through a hard political time
violence inheres to her, she drags the slaughter with her

and it seems to me that the thugs in power have already won
rumsfeld and hamas and israel all tearing everything limb from limb
spam's brought 29% already using email less and less
who wants to read the violence of viagra the violence of fraud

bush and blair thug-script leaks into what was once communality
and when i heard allen read it was that, community around him
the gathering and the chanting which actually worked and overcame
if just for a moment

and nn had her sense of human but now drags skulls
like i said, like i said
my own words and works try to burst their bounds, there's more hatred

there are mother-fuckers everywhere, why not deconstruct those words

for myself, i have to admit indiscretions in the past
psychological violence to other people, self-destruction, whimpering
inability to see people for who or what they really are
i'm more guilty than ginsberg, my soul is ash at best

eleven years or so after auschwitz and he's penning howl
against a smug america which today runs our country to the ground

if we can't learn to listen, we won't die trying, we'll just die

god or someone else help us, or someone else

Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

People really CARE on this list--about ideas, about poetry, about people.
Sometimes that caring leads them to say hurtful, or ridiculous things, but
it's all out of some passionate connection with the subject, with the
moment.
Sure, people should have the freedom to be outraged on this list--and they
do--but I've witnessed some pretty remarkable things in the midst of the
occasional mud-slinging and chaos.  Things that have given me a new
insight, a new angle on the subject I love.

Every time I log on I learn something.

One thing I can attest to is the caring that has been expressed both front
and back-channel over the years for Cid and Shizumi.  Many of you came
through for them and I'm so grateful for that.

The Buffalo list is wonderful--the energy and the intelligence in this
forum has been a great resource, a great aid and a great inspiration.
Esp. for someone far away from the New York Times and a bagel, cream
cheese, and lox lunch!

Jesse

Subject:      Ginsberg "creepiest"  --  Nudel "cool"????
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="US-ASCII"
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

Dear Mr. Nudel,
hoping you can clear up a little something.

so why is it that back on the 17th you had this
to say to reference to Ginsberg's alleged advances
toward his students:

  "tho the regent was far  creepier...
  and Allen G was the creepiest.."

then days later, when all the heat is turned way
up on your choice of words you had this to say:

"someone asked why
i didn't argue with Allen G
when he made  his
'to coin a phrase'
smart ass remark..

he wasn't talking to me..
i overheard it..& more
i was too busy trying
to sleep with my own students
(without much success)"

so when Ginsberg does it it's "creepy" but when
you do it it's what?  cool?  you're just this
cool guy all of a sudden?

why is it that you were judging Ginsberg like you're
some uptight old biddy always looking out the window
to keep an eye on the activity on the street, but as
soon as you get called on it, you're just one of the guys?

can you PLEASE tell us?
does it mean you were also creepy?
or does it mean that Ginsberg was creepy (excuse me,
i believe you actually said that he was the "creepiest")
for exercising his libido because he was what?  because he
was not using deodorant he was creepy?

what was it that made him so
creepy, while with your situation it was so smooth?
(despite the fact you say that you weren't getting any.
which is just more deflection as far as i'm concerned.
all of a sudden you want to appear cool, but not too cool,
oh no, not as cool as Ginsberg.  because this is you now
--in a way-- wanting us to believe that Ginsberg is cooler
because he's actually getting ass.  are you actually trying
to squeeze some weird sympathy after all you've said?)

Forthcoming in April:

PASTORELLES by John Taggart
  0-9746902-1-x $13.95

In Pastorelles, Taggart draws on the local culture of
rural Pennsylvania to consider the permutations of the
human mark. An abandoned one-room schoolhouse, a page
from an accounting ledger, a covered bridge still in use:
each offers a "glance / perhaps all that was ever possible"
into what persists. With wry humor, these poems attend
to the ecology of language in a season of drought.

Robert Creeley writes: "John Taggart has long been master
of accumulating, complexly layered patterns of sound and
sense, and here he uses his formal powers with a perfect,
unobtrusive authority. In these modest 'songs' of quiet
reflection Taggart echoes the world in which he’s lived,
making particular the mind and heart's persistent need.
If poetry has abiding value, and it has, it is because it can
so articulate, as here, all that a life comes to care about -
and all that it, so defined, ever is."

Pop culture has produced a similar trip: the opening
of a recent Simpsons episode featured an unfolding
much like the flordia oakleaf bit, though there's
involved a literal "universe within." Their trip
begins in the Simpsons' living room, pulling out
farther and farther until the universe is just a field
of black, then subatomic particles appear, atoms,
cells, etc. until we emerge out of Homer's head.

hear hear for anne waldman!...

discussing dead (or living) poets' biographies is one thing, but
smear campaigns are another... innuendo and insinuation are bringing
this list to another breakpoint---witness a few folks having already
decided to sign off...

is this what we want?... who we?...

you can't stop a thought, maybe, but we ought at least to hold
ourselves accountable for what we're saying... i.e., for the effect
saying such & such has in a forum such as this one... it's not simply
about hurting others' feelings, if that too... in terms of
communication, it's about proceeding as if one's ejaculations, or
whatever, are ipso facto warranted simply b/c one *can* express
same...

ok:  so i have a real problem, and am having more and more of a
problem, with harry nudel's and kirby olson's posts, not for what
they say, but for what they leave unsaid... they evidence a lack not
simply of restraint, but of care... kirby (if i may):  you are not
going to convert this list into lutheran central, i think you know
that by now... dr. n (if i may):  you need to get out of cryptic
mode, breathe some bright fucking air, and say what's on your mind,
b/c your posts of late are the essence of creepy, and sly creepy at
that...

at the risk of appearing sappy, how bout a little paul simon, which i
ought to apply more often to my undef self:  "honesty/it's such a
waste of energy/no you don't have to lie to me/just give me some
tenderness/beneath your honesty"...

to be candid, i just don't know what you fellas are hoping to
accomplish, and your feints at outsider or provocateur status are
feeling to this listmember not a little self-aggrandizing....

The Writers' Alliance of Newfoundland and Labrador
presents
Paris-based, Canadian poet and essayist Lisa Robertson.

Saturday, March 27
8:00 pm
The Studio (above Auntie Craes)
272 Water Street. Free.

Widely lauded for her inexhaustibly rich, intelligent poetry, Robertson
has published four books of poetry including the 2002 Relit Award for
Poetry winner, The Weather and Debbie: An Epic, a finalist for the 1998
Governor General's Award. Books in Canada calls Robertson, "one of our
most important, and most interesting poets."

'In this so-often-impersonal book (which is no small crime for a female
writer), she lets the landscape narrate, and from this newly constructed
body politic, a collective tells the tale. The writing of the weather
descriptions (which, I must admit, instantly changed mine) is incantatory.
... Dazzling!'
                     -Eileen Myles, The Nation about The Weather

Her most recent book is Occasional Works and Seven Walks from the Office
For Soft Architecture (Clear Cut Press), a linked series of prose walks
and essays on city space, architectural history, and decorative design.
The Office for Soft Architecture, headquartered in Vancouver, B.C.,
constructs propositions and documents for the advancement of a natural
history of civic surface.

Ms. Robertson also contributes a regular decorating horoscope to Nest: A
Quarterly of Interiors, under the pen name Swann.  Her essays on the
visual arts appear frequently in gallery catalogues, and her essays and
reviews on poetry have been published by The Globe and Mail, American Book
Review, Stand, The Poetry Project Newsletter, and The Stranger. In 1999
she was a visiting fellow at Cambridge University and writer-in-residence
at the University of California at San Diego, and at Capilano College in
North Vancouver.

The other day David Kirschenbaum was more than happy to give me a tour of his pad and show me the way around his archives. I am most appreciative of his honesty (he called me bad names but gave me free stuff!) and his character, and want to thank him in PUBLIC for his tour and friendship. There is one thing that appears on his shelf, a mag called THE GERM: JOURNAL OF POETIC RESEARCH.
I'm looking all over for this damn mag because it doesn't appear in any of the bookstores around the area nor do the libraries in the University of Maryland system carry it. Is there anybody out there (sorry, Roger) who can point me in the direction of picking up some copies? Is there a website (there appears to be none)? Someone want to send me a stash of extras?
David, thanks for an amazing time in NYC, you made home feel like HOME (because sometimes home feels like hOmE). And Sarah thinks yr the evil genius.
Grazie e ciao,
Chris

Hi Joe,

May I chop up your message?

> hear hear for anne waldman!...

Seconded. I thought her words beautiful, and while I don't know what her
intended effect was, they have had the effect of causing Harry to
increasingly drop his "think of the children" line and replace it more and
more with "think of that disguisting old queer." So nice to see people speak
what's really on their mind. It means that those of us who are willing to
ignore them can do so with more ease.

May I seriously inquire as to how often this list reaches "another
breakpoint?"

This is one of the basic lessons of adulthood. On the other hand, so is not
allowing children to throw you into a sulk.

Humor rocks.

I can see why you would say that, but to call oneself a poet without being
self-aggrandizing seems roughly like calling oneself a Republican without
taking orders from one's robot masters. The role of poet not only assumes
that one is qualified to discuss life's headiest concepts with more
concision and beauty than the best writer of prose, while using a manner of
dialogue deliberately intended to be divorced from uncreative speech, but
assumes that the poet's pursuit is worthwhile in the face of the utter
apathy of the rest of humanity. The self-aggrandizement required to sign on
to a poetics list beats that implied by excessive iconoclasm, any day.

Kirby has said that his goal is not to sway people, but to clarify his
"Lutheran surrealism" in his own mind, while taking notes on reactions. (If
he's also said the opposite, I've missed it.) The strengthening of a
philosophy is a group goal, even if only one person is focused on it, and so
long as he can handle criticism when his arguments are weak and/or beyond
all social mores, such behavior furthers the goal of a poetic discussion
group. I'm starting to think Harry's genuine goal is to make people unhappy,
but as long as it's on a voluntary basis, he's providing a service, also.
(Please feel free to offer a rebuttal, Harry, which I assure you I will not
take personally.)

No idea if some fellow west-Pennsylvanians lurk on the list, but as I'm
regulary tantalized by notice of events in San Francisco or London, I'll take the
liberty of inviting all ... near or far...John Taggart reading in Indiana, PA
(50 miles east of Pittsburg) next Tuesday.

----------------------------------------
Noted Pennsylvania Poet
Inaugurates Visiting Writers Series

A widely published poet-critic, John Taggart will perform work from his
forthcoming book at 7pm on Tuesday, 30 March 2004, in the University Square
Building, 1176 Grant Street, Indiana, PA.   The first event in the new OffPage
Visiting Writer series, it is free and open to the public.

Taggart's modern poetry incorporates his intimate knowledge of art, music,
and spirituality.  His work has been praised as  "a poetry of remarkable
presence and power."  Another critic notes, "I know of none who in the present can so
flood the soul with melody."

Author of more than a dozen books, including Song of Degrees: Essays on
Contemporary Poetry and Poetics, and the highly-regarded poetry collections Dodeka,
Peace on Earth, and When the Saints, Taggart is also the former director of
the Interdisciplinary Arts Program at Shippensburg University. He often
meditates on composers, singers, painters, or sculptors, and has released several
audio recordings.

OffPage: A Visiting Writer Event is sponsored by the IUP College of
Humanities and Social Sciences, Department of English, and Graduate Studies in
Literature and Criticism, with the Commonplace Coffeehouse.  Kenneth Sherwood, a new
Assistant Professor of English at IUP, organized the event as a complement to
his graduate course in poetry performance and other creative writing
opportunities at IUP.

Subject:      Cid Corman -Zukofsky -Whalen
Mime-version: 1.0
Content-type: text/plain; charset="US-ASCII"
Content-transfer-encoding: 7bit

This morning - rereading Zukofsky's  "A-21" & remembering sitting with Cid
Corman in Kyoto one warm July afternoon (1988) on the patio outside a coffee
shop near the front of the Ryoanji Temple entrance. The way his hands held
an  edition of one of the early sections of "A" - the open pages fully
engaged with penciled notes, wrinkled from years of reading and rereading -
as if, I thought then, in possession of a sacred instrument - and his
expressed commitment to write an exhaustive interpretation.

Did that work ever see the light of "published" day? I do not know.

Also, yesterday, while reading Philip Whalen's Kyoto notebooks (1969 - 1970)
in the Bancroft Library seeing evidence of meetings between the two, not
enough to register the depth of that. One suspects two giants - occasionally
rubbing shoulders and figuring ways to continue to connect with American
literary life - while both lived in enormous social isolation.  Philip's
Kyoto journals - in addition to the daily attentions - are full of
reflections on many political and material aspects of American life -
railing about capitalism, protestantism, etc. - combined with many loving
dream childhood episodes of being with his family in Oregon. Interesting to
also note his interest in Wallace Stevens and Dame Edith Sitwell - a joy in
Dylan Thomas's stories and disinterest in the sound of his "clattering"
verse.  And great drawings - caricatures - with colored inks and often
hilarious commentary on the visual content. But also obviously a psychically
hard, sometimes harrowing time, figuring out where he can ever fit either
into an American life (literary, at least) and/or a full acceptance - the
initiation and commitment -  into a Buddhist religious vocation:

30:VIII:69

           Wasp in the bookshelves rejects
Walt Whitman, Herman Melville, Emily
Dickenson, the Goldiard Poets, A vedic
Reader, Lama Govinda, Medieval French
verses & romances, Long Discourse of the
Buddha and the Principal Upanishads.
The window glass reads more enter-
tainingly, but soon she leaves that for
the fox tail grass the camellia hedge the
dull mid-morning sun.

Philip Whalen, Kyoto Notebook (Bancroft Library, Berkeley, California)


 It is interesting to me now how the journal form renders up - or can - the
geological under-scape of an artist's life - the slow, meandering, the lost
parts, the inner-boilings and sufferings without form, so many vague shadows
on the wall -  all of which precede the formulations found in the well made
poem and/or the release of a sequence. I suspect it's the "successful"
artist/poet's anguish to have his or her life utterly & perpetually read and
confused with the delight and order found in finished works. Such
deceptions!

Recently Mark DuCharme sent out a plug for my online literary magazine of
creative translation, www.CipherJournal.com.

I'd like to reiterate that plug (look at www.CipherJournal.com! It's new and
exciting and great!), and appeal for submissions in honor of Cid Corman. I'm
particularly looking for prose that would send more people into the
libraries in search of Corman's journals, translations, and poems. But of
course the best writing will prevail, and all accounts--in poetry, in prose,
in translation--featuring good writing will find a home on CipherJournal.

As always, the journal is open to all comments, submissions, and questions.

Lucas

Hello,

I'll be going to Korea this Summer to live for a year and I'm looking to
connect with any like-minded poets/artists who may be living there. My
primary job in Korea will be teaching and writing, but I plan to find out as
much as I can about Korean experimental music/film/literature and possible
spark some collaborative projects with artists. If anyone knows of someone
who might be good to contact I'd appreciate any info available. You can
respond to me off list at bonnie@berndtgroup.net.

Thanks for your help!

Candidate Plea Bargains Harassment Calls
by Willard Adolph Hearse



They hang the man and flog the woman
That steal the goose from off the common,
But let the greater villain loose
That steals the common from the goose.

".....at a time when I am speaking to you about the paradox of desire -- in
the
sense that different goods obscure it -- you can hear outside the awful
language
of power.  There's no point in asking whether they are sincere or
hypocritical,
whether they want peace of whether they calculate the risks.  The dominating
impression as such a moment is that something that may pass for a prescribed
good; information addresses and captures impotent crowds to whom it is poured

forth like a liquor that leaves them dazed as they move toward the slaughter
house.
One might even ask if one would allow the cataclysm to occur without first
giving
free reign to this hubbub of voices...."

Hi everyone,

I wanted to just give you all (and particularly subscribers to Combo) an update
on what's going on with the mag and other news.  This is the longest stretch
I've gone without publishing an issue of the magazine, I guess about 5 months
now.  There are good reasons for this which I'll get to in a minute but first
off: COMBO 13 is about to hit the typesetting stage; it includes poetry by Ray
DiPalma, Brandon Downing, Stephanie Young, an excerpt from Araki Yasusada's
Letters in English, and an interview with Jerome Rothenberg, among much else.
So, it'll be out sometime this Spring.

As for my excuses: a 3 yr old and a 5 month old daughter at home have certainly
slowed me down a bit.  But the bigger and better excuse is that, in addition to
continuing the magazine, I am now, on a very small scale, publishing books as
COMBO BOOKS.  (Not accepting unsolicited submissions as of yet.) The first
Combo Book is K. Silem Mohammad's A THOUSAND DEVILS and it will be available on
May 1.  A fine looking trade paperback of 104 pages with a kick ass cover
featuring swarming ants and many many fantastic poems.  Here are the words of
two wonderful poets on Mohammad's book:

*******************
Imagine Olivier portraying Yosemite Sam as a Bedouin, "May a thousand devils
take 'em!", which I'm told is a curse as PG Obsolete as Pantagruel yelling
"Sacre Bleu!"  However, be warned as each of Mr Mohammad's poems provides a
new form of hotfoot for the info-damned at the nostalgia-plex; read for
example "The New South."  Hear within devils pass through a participle
accelerator as the sound of nouns bleeds away the din to reveal Pandemonium.

--Michael Gizzi

If an ancient had an epileptic seizure, he was possessed by a
thousand devils.  When he regained consciousness, the devils were
driven out by a healer. The devils had to go somewhere. In this case
they have gone into the poems. Upon reading this book, my brain
seemed to be scorched with a hissing flame of fire. a million nerves
were open and screaming in agony, curling hooks into my flesh. I went
to bed but could not sleep. The words were like flying birds, the
lines like humming bees. Pandemonium! The poems roar or whisper
balefully from the sand or from the wind, or stir unseen in the
coiling silence; or fall from the heavens like  crushing incubi. They
yawn like a sudden pit before the eye of the reader. I see in the
poems the traces of a simple honest heart; and in his large, deep
eyes, fiery black and bold, there seem tokens of a spirit that would
dare a thousand devils (and the hairy creature clinging to his
throat) to scream with infernal delight at the sound and sight of
these verses' awful agony and hopeless despair. With their dismal
fooleries they transform our worthless days and disentangle a
thousand evils, and they are indeed, incredible.

--Nada Gordon
*************************

So, there you go.  The second Combo book in the series will be ALSO WITH MY
THROAT I SHALL SWALLOW TEN THOUSAND SWORDS: ARAKI YASUSADA'S LETTERS IN
ENGLISH.  This book follows and compliments the controversial and fascinating
DOUBLED FLOWERING: FROM THE NOTEBOOKS OF ARAKI YASUSADA (Roof 1997). I'm
extremely excited to be publishing it.

I may as well tell you as well about a new Combo subscription plan which I'm
calling the "Full Lifetime Subscription."  For $100.00 you will receive all
future issues of the magazine and all future books published by Combo.  If you
are already a Lifetime Subscriber to the magazine you can sign on to this plan
for $50.

If you're feeling extra suacy and have money burning a hole in your pocket you
can also consider becoming one of Combo's Major Supporters for $1000.00.  This
entitles you to a full lifetime subscription for yourself and for 10 other
people of your choice.  You will be thanked specifically on the copyright and
acknowledgements page at the front of each Combo book.

Just letting you know that my "My Angie Dickinson" series now includes 130 poems

I am preparing for a Ph.D. exam (tomorrow!), and one of my texts is Gertrude
Stein's "Bee Time Vine and Other Pieces."  However, I still have not been
able to get ahold of this via library or interlibrary loan.  I've read
"Tender Buttons" and if anyone can fill me in about "Bee Time Vine" I would
be most appreciative. Perhaps you have a few of its poems on your hard drive
you'd be willing to forward?  Or anything especially helpful about Stein, a
short essay, anything at all... that would help me contextualize "Bee Time
Vine" in terms of Stein and modernism.

Talk Series: Rahna Reiko Rizzuto
Rahna Reiko Rizzuto writes, =B3Language creates us=8Bwe use it to define
ourselves, and then to reflect that identity. In my writing and my research
about life during war, I have seen how memory shrinks and warps until it is
no more than the sum of the stories we have told most often, and our =B3true=B2
experience, if there was such a thing, has disappeared. In my talk I would
like to explore the poetics and the rhetoric of war, and the language of
memory, as I experienced them in Japan in September 2001, and as I saw them
shape our notions of ourselves, as individuals, citizens, and members of a

Oregon Supreme Court Declines to Intervene in Gay Marriage
The Oregon State Supreme Court on Wednesday declined to intervene in
the state's debate over same-sex marriage. The move comes in response
to a lawsuit asking the court to stop same-sex marriages in Multnomah
County. The suit was filed by Bruce Broussard, a Republican candidate
for the U.S. Senate. The court stated that Broussard did not have any
legal standing to bring the suit.

yes Harry, you're amusing.  i could almost imagine
you wiggle in your chair writing this post.

and yes yes, it's clear you want all the talk to change into
me being the priss for pissing on your Ginsberg gossip.

but who is confused?

i believe it was you who started all this with a puritanical
tone about the "creepiest" Ginsberg.  the creepiness of
desire, which of course you wanted to shrug off a few
days later with a deeper voice and stuffed crotch, letting
us know how much you had wanted to fuck your own
students, which, by the way, isn't creepy all of a sudden.

(which of course it isn't creepy.  it's not like you and
Ginsberg were teaching first grade!  these students were
young adults who could suck your cocks or not.  i do recall
you saying that in your case it was mostly the "not."
which is okay Harry, nothing to be ashamed of.)

but of course, while what you say of Ginsberg is hearsay,
what you say of yourself is confession.  so maybe you
wanted to come clean to show us how your pious judgment
against Ginsberg was really a projection of how you really
feel about your own actions.

xoxo (for you H) xoxo,

CAConrad
p.s. was the "spit on your grave" for me?
that's so sweet of you Harry.  take some
snapshots and bring them to Hell, where
we'll dine and laugh at old times.

The English Language and Politics

1946


A scrupulous writer, in every sentence that he writes,
will ask himself at least more questions.

[ahem]

At Most, people who bother with it generally assumed
that English language would admit the matter that we
cannot do anything about it by all the conscious
action it is in a way bad, but is. so inevitably Our
argument is the decadent share our general in language
runs the civilization and must collapse -- --. hansom
aeroplanes struggle against electric candles like a
language follows the abuse that It is preferring to
archaism or to any sentimental cabs of light,. an we
lies Underneath belief that the half-conscious
instrument is our own language and not this growth for
which a natural shape purposes.

Now, it is clear that the economic causes of a
political language must ultimately decline and have:
the bad writer of this individual is simply not due to
it or that influence. But an intensified form can
indefinitely become an original cause reinforcing the
producing effect in effect the same cause, and, and a
so on. because because the more man may then take
[in]himself, he feels all drinks to be A drink and he
a failure to fail completely. It is the English
language rather that is happening to the same thing.
to have our thoughts slovenliness becomes the language
and makes It easier for us because our foolish foolish
ugly inaccurate thoughts are,  but of it. is The
process the point that is reversible. imitation is
willing to take written English which can be English
which is, bad, and spread if necessary the especially
Modern trouble avoided by one full of habits. rid of
these necessary political habits one can first step
toward and clearly a generation clearly gets to think
If one is more: rethink. so that fight against the
frivolous English is not professional and is not the
exclusive concern of bad writers. what I will have
said will presently become clearer by the time of this
that I have come back to, meaning here and that. now
is habitually here as Meanwhile I hope written
specimens of the English language are it.

[...]

It is at this political point that the special
debasement, which is that connection of language with
language, and the between becomes clear in a new
languaging. Sincerity? Try, you’ll see. It’s like
Chinese.

Cams is an exhibition and book project by artist Elliot Anderson that
uses personal web cameras as source material. Web cameras are small
video cameras that attach to a personal computer and broadcast live
video images in real-time on the Internet. Anderson watches a number
of these cameras regularly and captures a frame from the video stream
that appeals to him both conceptually and aesthetically. He sees the
work as a form of "street photography" with the Internet being the
"street".

A selection of these images appear in a book entitled CAMS. In this
book Anderson has collaborated with a number of fiction writers and
poets to create this book including Dodie Bellamy, Kevin
Killian,Taylor Brady, Mark Ewert, Sarah Gina Jones, Jan Richman,
Zakary Szymanski, et al. He has given a selection of images to
participating writers asking them to select one or more of them to
use as inspiration to create a written work of fiction.

Orange is one way. Imagine walking on fluoresence
until the soles of your feet are blue. It could even
be warm, provided providence divides. The jets sound
smooth thoroughly of head velour with munificence. A
fat girl with glasses cruising drama is relative.
Talent latent in natal coral. My native thrift of
button onyx used to love poetry for it's own sake;

FREDDY O .COLLAZO: Pasty with corpses glow in sight of
trails of nouns snowing woods.

JOANN REUSE: I don't have any relatives buried there.

FREDDY O. COLLAZO: I believe we should have a standing
army.

JOSHUA LEWIS: Why?

FREDDY O. COLLAZO: Because then we could save on
chairs.

JOANN REUSE: Sunshine butters along black sprite
reflected torrid gray t-shirt or pod cars of mustard
trucks just slut wet where ice fingers dribbled to
hollow rubber falls.

MICHAEL J. KAPALIN: Sunshine butters along.

(Don't take it personally when the day ripens enough
for cars to stop toggled before you, sapping through
steel leaks the  eggshell tranquil lilt of your
morning)

MICHAEL J. KAPALIN: I prefer a perforated silence.

SHARON BRADLEY: With a window cracked. In the deep
pocket of a stout wood pipe. Along the kissable
flames. Beneath us.

JOSHUA LEWIS: You're using us less as icons.

JOANN REUSE: Fingering our faces as braille in order
to situate.

MALINDA BENDER: Swallow.

SHEILA MURPHY: Blue light topography on frames slit
mats aside so wine string growling alto erodes. Doors
upon vent porcelain and silent vestibules boomerang
sing flurry of acclimates foyer. Pissing verbs apple
cat recitation or bit filler axiom ruddy if boat
reverb. Then bool inert. Tunnel broad leaves velvet in

LEWIS LACOOK: Rich cardboard sky, ripped and shuffled
like the blossum of a collage.

JOSHUA LEWIS: Stainless steel sky so tears slide off.

ALAN SONDHEIM: This is the flower of the mysteriously
swollen finger, Nikuko.

SHARON BRADLEY: I want you to stick around because I
need a reason to.

AZURE CARTER: It's wild and talks about nothing but
its mine.

SYD BARRETT: Trees flame off flat beams impossibly
moved out, gorgeous. Not seriously. Tame meat is day
relationship contact, maybe twice a year, other people
gray spiked couple, started this story. On those days
your head crowded with alkali. Checker parquet
crumpled like film tin doors as taped voices coif palm
north like app alias Beirut. The saw of the music
reverberates a sea and mouth throughput the store. In
that mirror I frown with short hair. Eating. Cigarette
birds dawn wishbone topiaries if hard-won smoke
flickers in curling off every motion. A jutting is
tooth pullinge sanguin across a breath. Your mouth

Dear all

     During the month of February I found a free time to write a brief =20=

review on Ana Maria Uribe which was published in the printed Jornal do =20=

Margs (Museu de Arte do Rio Grande do Sul), or, Journal of Museum of =20
Art from Rio de Grande do Sul, South Brazil, in March, and is available =20=

in: www.margs.org.br (click "revista" and, later, "Jornal do Margs" to =20=

download the newspaper in Portuguese). I'm passing an English =20
translation of my review.

     When the edition was available on line, I wrote an email to Ana =20
Maria Uribe exactly on March 5th, 2004. I didn't know it would become a =20=

tribute to her.

Ana Maria Uribe and the Dance of Letters



The poetry of Ana Maria is sprightly, it comes out of the printed =20
pages, it has the versatility of being suited to printed and electronic =20=

media and explores each one in creative intermedia. Reading her printed =20=

book offers us the spatialized words which evoke sounds, movements and =20=

images. The CD-ROM or site bring us enchanted sounds and movements: =20
they are letters and colors that dance, dialogue, enchant, make us =20
laugh and think. On the homepage, the sound made by a ticking clock =20
marks a kind of time of reading: a strong and repeated sound which =20
invites the navigator to go on on his/her way, not to stop, and read =20
more and more: http://amuribe.tripod.com.

The Argentinean Ana Maria Uribe, from Buenos Aires, is author of: =20
Tipoemas (Typoems,1968), typographic poems created by using the =20
typewriter Lettera; Anipoemas (Anipoems,1997), animated poems =20
reinvented for the web; Escaleras y Otros Anipoemas (Ladders and Others =20=

Poems, 2001), a selection of her poems in CD-ROM; Tipoemas y Anipoemas =20=

(Typoems and Anipoems, hand-made book, 2001) and El Circo: El gran =20
desfile (The Circus: The Grand Parade, Russian edition by Eter Panji of =20=

World Visual Poetry collection, 2002).

The site was built with the same concision as her poems: the routes are =20=

clear, easy and agreeable, without heavy images that take long to =20
download. . Sounds, noises and voices accompany all the words in space =20=

which move. The behaviour of the dancing letters indicates daily, =20
seemingly innocuous, automated and constant activities, but the way =20
this situations appears, it makes us laugh or think.  It is what we can =20=

notice in some words and titles such as: Burbujas (Bubbles), Panorama =20=

desde un tren (A view from a train), Gimnasia (Gym), Se larg=F3 (It's =20=

Parm=E9nides a J. P. Sartre (=46rom Parmenides to J.P. Sartre), Bowling, =
=20
Guggenheim Museum, and Hojas Rojas Secas (Dry Red Leaves), among others.

"Poema Cortante" (Cutting Poem) at http://amuribe.tripod.com/sharp.html =20=

is, for me, the limit of the media and the fusion of verbal, visual and =20=

animation languages, one of the most important aspect which =20
characterizes  this poet's work: a group of letters "o" draw the handle =20=

of lamina (knife? dagger? sword? which is formed by a  prolonged trace. =20=

The poem format seems to suggest an "o" of admiration for the discovery =20=

of the fusion of languages.







          The interviews given by Uribe -  =20

Passages like phrases move in and out of hearing. The memory of having
heard them before forms part of the pleasure, as does the afternoon
light on the walls and floors, after the long succession of greys,
cold rains, the cold rain down having rained for days, so why should
my writing this afternoon remember this debate about societies,
spectacles, and how the average person passes their time when they're
not working? Writing should never be work, the work, the temptation to
call the writing, work, my work, to dignify writing, and define for it
a place and usefulness. Writers started writing for the classroom, and
there's a classroom as soon as two or more people are seated in a room,
anywhere. It gets worse. To confer the title of an official on it, and
it becomes verse. People read though, once in a while. Footsteps again
overhead. Intervals, a sound or chord is struck against the thought
there might not be any sound at all, and there is a problem in the
word, unsound. Said of an object not well made; said of an idea,
insupportable; said of a person, their mind. The word has lost its
depth. Sound minds and bodies. Don't make a sound, they said, those who
were hiding--about 200 here, where I am writing, oh, about the first
week of August, 1944. Only three years later Boldereff writes to Olson
to thank him for _Call Me Ishmael_ (New York: Reynal & Hitchcock,
1947). There is not a single "sound" reference to Europe in the 550
pages of their three-year correspondence. "I greet you at the beginning
of a great career," etc., 1950.

Depth enters with reference to a date and documents. All reading is
arbitrary, why apologize for the violence of the juxtaposition? The
correspondence and the chronicle. The one site a reconstructed or
reconstituted "book" designed from an intense personal (private)
exchange over several years, the second site a public record of the
eventual liquidation of a target population over several years,
1941-1944. (The "book" designed from the chronicle is an abbreviated
version, the English translation numbering some 533 pages, pp. 3-536.
The Boldereff-Olson correspondence numbers ten pages more, pp. 1-543.
Therein lies the rub. Call me Ezekiel, call me the Four Zoas, call me
Maximus, call me The Motz. Every interpretive reading constructs its
own frames, at least the ones that it's capable of recognizing and
acknowledging. My insight is that the disappearance (liquidation) of
one site reflects (in the most profound--soundest--form of this term
available, Benjamin's) on the corresponding site, the brassy
trumpeting from the heavens of undying dedication and adoration at the
birth of a poet. Writers create one another, one way or another, as
much as they create themselves. But has it been said enough, that the
scene of writing extending even to the always arbitrary placements of
anyone's writing within the larger culture, even if by culture all
that is meant or intended is the circulation of a body of writing
among its readers and other writers, depends on the liquidation of an
anterior historical site? If what is sought is a glimpse at hegemonic
processes greater than the individuals writing, as great as those
persons may be and as great as they think themselves to be. The
chronicle of the Lodz ghetto enters history in its English translation
in 1984. Fifteen years later, in 1999, the cultural history of
American poetry receives the chronicle of two lives intersecting at
the turning point of the burning question: to write or not, given such
circumstances and conditions as cannot be directly represented, but
which may be given their sharpest contour in contrast to the life
conditions represented in the chronicle of the Lodz ghetto.

Objects throw light. If I bring two to all appearances unlike objects
into proximity and rub them together into commentary, interpretation,
glossalia, reading these textual objects in such a way as they could
not have imagined themselves being read, for one, the Boldereff-Olson
correspondence, as important as it is to draw attention to the 1999
Wesleyan edition as a recomposition, beginning at the beginning but
ending at an artificial timepoint, and so constructing a narrative
where before there were only surviving records of life, around which
there should always remain a strong measure of respect for the
realtime fallibility of being human (which we cannot know without the
chronicle of Lodz ghetto--"thrownness"--being itself as being 'error
prone'--I am not a Jew, why are you throwing me in the Lodz ghetto?)

This question may be imagined for many of the deportees arriving from
Western Europe. Always this endless calling back to a previous and
abandoned designation. Once there was a partitioned sector of a city
that resigned themselves to their fate, a pre-existing manufacturing
culture allowed itself to be organized into military production, at
starvation wages, labor itself became criminalized--partitioned,
contained, marked--the Jew as Worker--then, at that moment, on that
threshold, without a State--so that the self-liquidation of this
specially designated proletariat from within the arbitration of a
religious hierarchy and political-police terror openly collaborating
with the very forces--arrangements, arraignments--that seek to
extinguish them, their society, their culture, their way of life,
arrives towards an approximate image of manageability, administrative
subjects from which all proofs of unruliness stand out and strike an
affinity to fundamental indivisibility. The chronicle itself
represents an effort to project, even to historical memory, the virtue
of public order and the internal disciplining of a none-too-imaginary
community. (We obeyed every protocol, every amendment to the
administrative code, and we were still liquidated!)

It is to the imaginary community of poets that the Poet of the
Boldereff-Olson correspondence migrates, unconstrained by boundaries
or any designation other than the self-projection operating in the
form of the aggrandizing persona, the intimacy of private space lived
as expression, creativity and its historical imagination sexualized,
made mythic, assertively liberated. Both correspondents are well aware
that they are writing in a form of belonging to the same history as
Blake's mythographies and Keats' letters. Historical time itself is at
issue, among forays into the early recesses of civilization--the
history of writing--Mesopotomian, Mesoamerican--one driving at
religion and the other at primordial being, primitiveness,
irrationality, though they write equally with full awareness of the
administration of literature against which the token, the gift, the
talismanic _Call Me Ishmael_, functions as an originating
counterforce. Boldereff writes as an imaginary Russian-passioned
pilgrim to Kiev and the 'fantasy of a third Rome' (Mandelstam).

Or, creative longing counterposed to communal belonging. Poetry has
still not thought enough about the social and its multiple
demarcations. Territories are integral to the definition of an exact
space, map, grid, boundary, area, zone: partitioning and managing a
target population. They must be made into something they are not. They
must be made to appear more the same than they are. Anyone is every
one of 'them.' They must be identified, catalogued, administered.
These are among the first human beings to become data, and becoming
data, excrescence. This is what happened in the Jewish ghetto of Lodz
at mid-century, in advance. The counterweight? "A more architecturally
developed variation of the banded city was proposed by Ivan Leonidov
in his 1930 competition entry for the steel-producing settlement of
Magnitogorsk. Although similar to ['the 1920s Russian theorist N.A.']
Milutin's basic scheme ['parallel zones'] it excludes the industrial
zone from the band and, as a form of linear grid, allows for
programmatic interaction among the remaining functions. In its high
degree of abstraction, its absence of hierarchy, its unique interface
between parallel zones, its access to open landscape, Leonidov's
project continues to be an important theoretical model." (Albert Pope,
_Ladders_. NY: Princeton Architectural Press, 1996, p. 67). By way of
contrast: "The most consistent and didactic body of work on modern
urban closure comes from the German theorist, Ludwig Hilberseimer.
Hilberseimer's projects ... provide an important guide to the
processes of postwar spatial production, specifically spatial
'implosion.' (Pope 57).

Can you see how often I get through my Poetics mail? I'm losing against
the tide... my Poetics box is up to 305 unread messages again, when did
that happen?

RE Scalapino's Defoe -- I don't really know what to say about it. Search
the Poetics archive for what others have said -- I'm a little hesitant
to color your reading with mine... but one could say it's dealing in
novel-form with some similar issues as The Way...? Perspective and lack
there of, writing experience, writing in the present.

It's narrative has a bit of a "road movie" quality to it, but has its
own way of getting down the road?

Source texts influence it all over the place and I swear, one of the
more idiosyncratic sources is A-Ha's video for Take On Me. Or maybe
that's just my idiosyncratic reading...

Sun & Moon put it out a while back; grab it and dive in. Just too
scattered today to give a better "review" -- but if you've found
yourself spinning through Scalapino's work before, or through other
experimental prose outtings then this will do you well I'm sure.

MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="US-ASCII"
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

I don't know if this is helpful or not...but here's a little review of
_Defoe_I wrote years ago for now defunct  _TapRoot Reviews_ :


I think that DEFOE is a work of genius on the scale of FINNEGAN'S WAKE, THE
MAKING OF AMERICANS, THE DISASTERS OF WAR and GUERNICA.  But, while Scalapino's
work deserves comparison to that of Joyce, Stein, Goya and Picasso, it is
Kathy Acker's oeuvre I want to invoke here.  The universe of Acker's
fiction-built-from-fiction is abusive, apocalyptic and "in your face."  The horror
(whore-her) of her narratives derives from the ways in which sexuality and violence
are casually, causally and explicitly intertwined.  Something related but
different is happening in DEFOE.

DEFOE enacts a kind of dull affect, a resolute flattening of language
horizoning perception and consciousness, description and event.  Fantasies,
autobiography, commentary on current events, film and DEFOE itself, merge with dream
narratives to produce a landscape less blatant but more terrifying than anything
to be found in Acker's work.  Scalapino's anger and passion are evident but
mightily restrained.
Her strategy of understatement pays off in a major way with DEFOE's
overrwhelming cumulative effect.

Working out of received fictions, Kathy Acker's writing highlights our
culture's essential disfunctions.  Scalapino's enacts a backdoor move on the
received through a poetic phenomenology of the perceived in which "the fiction is so
transparent and separated that it doesn't exist."

DEFOE  is one of those rare works of art which will not be exhausted of its
meaning.  And Leslie Scalapino is that rarest of writers--one that is utterly
awake.

AWP was a really good event and getting to see so many Buffalo Listers and
putting faces with names was great. I also like the postiveness and the fact
that we all seemed all to be pulling in the same direction which is rare for
poets. I am going to post my AWP on my blog but I think that most important
thing to come out of this is that Poets who are innovative have allot in
common and if we are going to be taken seriously we need to have a critical
mass and positive activist mentality;

I spent time with our great local Chicago poets, like Jesse Seldess, Kerri
Sonnenberg, Chuck Stebelston, and John Tipton and I also spent time with
great national poets like Peter Gizzi, Liz Willis, Catherine Daly, Jen
Hofer,Sina Queyras, Brian Clements, Bob Perlman, Paul Hoover, Maxine
Chernoff,Joe Amato and many others and there were great conversations,
shared interests and a passion for poetry and language among all these
people that is shared.

It was kind of like that great Catholic idea, the Mystical Body except
poetry is what binds and this is positive and important.   I hope that here
on on the buffalo list we can promote that kind of positive and passionate
discorse and leave the petty and small conversations for others.

What do you think?

turn at the punctuation,
you're all the rage I guess but
that tone of sharp grit? that's mine
the lashes are all woven from belly scraps
not all biting creatures are wolves I say but
I'm no scientist I guess, only sea bits come
from my sweating, you could be more
productive they tell me, strangers here are
plucked one by one till they're all gone we're
still here, they're now bits, & the bits? - they're
now in the sea, only sea bits come from my
sweating, that tone of sharp grit turns at
the punctuation, why straw when every drop
entertains? you want to water my brow with
them? you could be more productive they tell me
who comes up missing gets woven into my lashes
I'll pile their air towering for my dessert, for my next
trick, or have I said that before? turn you face up to
the sea bit bosses if you can't look me in the eye
sign on the line, at the punctuation, to give them
an hour's leave, this paid tale is their favorite dream
their lips, scraps spiking the water, were lost in a pile
of bricks, my house creatures are half-built words
what was to be their winding sheets now serve as
doors, walk right in, turn left at the punctuation,
you can join them in watering my brow, happy
families are all alike, we'll peacefully wear locks of
astonishment and shake the water from our hair
you'll wear a belt of straw and ivy buds, with coral
clasps and amber studs, imagine the sun fluttering
in your paws thick five times over, owing to your
rawness it broke and its scraps I wolf: a gentleman
on my father's side was hanged for stealing horses

While I still do not understand the significant difference of the new
flame rules, I will say as an active member of poetix since 95 & a
lurker before that, nearly unsolved flame controversy that has been
created has been about the recently dead.  AG is the third instance that
comes immediately to my mind, (following Said, and Dorn) and as
vitrolically ugly as the previous two. Members leave the list over these
things.

Those who are living appear to defend themselves quite well and every
list removal has happened as a result of an attack on the living.
Shouldn't we be just as concerned with the dead with this flame rule?

Be well

Thanks for highlighting this intriguing new Fletcher book. I first learned
of it as one of a number of source texts informing an ecopoetic
correspondence between Marcella Durand & Tina Darragh. I've heard excerpts
from the ongoing project. Something to look out for.

Robert Wetvak's Haiti after Aristide:
The Bullshit Doesn't Get Any More Transparent Than Wetvak:
The Country That Major General Smedley Butler Made Safe For The National City
Bank Boys Back In The Democratic Administration Of 1915
By Robert Wetvak, Legendary Policy Pimp




They hang the man and flog the woman
That steal the goose from off the common,
But let the greater villain loose
That steals the common from the goose.

".....at a time when I am speaking to you about the paradox of desire -- in
the
sense that different goods obscure it -- you can hear outside the awful
language
of power.  There's no point in asking whether they are sincere or
hypocritical,
whether they want peace of whether they calculate the risks.  The dominating
impression as such a moment is that something that may pass for a prescribed
good; information addresses and captures impotent crowds to whom it is poured

forth like a liquor that leaves them dazed as they move toward the slaughter
house.
One might even ask if one would allow the cataclysm to occur without first
giving
free reign to this hubbub of voices...."

we need to be out there protesting.. we need to be fucking shuting it
down.. no more discrimination... no more hate.. no more two tiered
systems... fucking shut it down now....

I make a public stand to end this discrimination... and I will not enter a
state that legalize discrimination... I will not read my poetry in public
unless it has to do with an action to shut this hate down... enough... if
we continue to stand by and watch we are all guilty of any hate  that
comes from some emboldened fool..  we can no longer stand by... its time
to act or loose more rights...

and I want to know who is next..

who else will lose their rights as the rest of us continue life as ussual...


today...

I wrote a long message about the wonders of Tinfish which was rejected
by poetics.

So now I'm reduced to saying that

after a year and a half of wrangling, the IRS

has given Tinfish Press

non-profit status

so that we can publish a full-range

of Hawai`i and international poetries

Please take a look at our site

http://tinfishpress.com

and, even if you choose not to buy from us,

you can make a donation!



aloha, Susan

discuss Neruda and read from work influenced by Neruda's poetry. Dennis
Maloney, translator of three books of Neruda's poetry, will read from his

John Brandi is an artist and poet, author of thirty-six books of poetry,
including Heartbeat Geography: selected and uncollected poems 1966-1994 and
most recently, In What Disappears, both from White Pine Press. His paintings
and collages are in collections worldwide. In his introduction to John
Brandi's Heartbeat Geography, Scott Nicolay likens Brandi's poems to
footprints: they are at once traces of his travels and evidence of the
slight division between his body and the land. These "footprints" range from
free-form lyrics with simple refrains to the seventeen loaded syllables of
American haiku. He writes of God and gods, lust and love, the dignity of
conch diggers, goatherds, peach pickers, stowaways, believers, breakdancers
and the newly born. His observations reflect his ever-changing surroundings,
his growth and age, the political moment, his affirmation of adventure, and
always, his Whitmanian love of the whole untidy mass of experience.

Downloadable reader's guide is available on the Just Buffalo website under
"World of Voices."

POG

presents

poets Charles Alexander & Karen Falkenstrom

Sunday, April 4, 7pm
Bookman’s
southwest corner of Speedway & Wilmot
free & open to the public

Charles Alexander, author of books of poetry that include Hopeful Buildings,
arc of light / dark matter, Pushing Water 1-6, Four Ninety Eight to Seven,
Etudes: D & D, and the just-released, from Singing Horse Press, Near or
Random Acts. Works at Chax Press (which will be 20 years old in August
2004), which he founded, making books and creating art in book form.
Partnered in life and such art with Cynthia Miller. Teaching includes short
classes and workshops at various universities around the nation, and more
frequently at the University of Arizona Poetry Center, The Learning Curve,
Naropa University, and Pima Community College.

Karen Falkenstrom has been a Tucsonan for 15 years, during which time she
earned an MFA from the UA Creative Writing program and served as
Administrative Director for the Among Other Things... literary arts series,
and, later, as Executive Director of the Tucson Poetry Festival. She joined
the UA Poetry Center staff in 1992 and, in 1993, co-founded Kore Press with
Lisa Bowden. (In 2002, a computer spell check revealed that "Kore" is just
"Korea" without an a, and since Karen is herself a "1.5 generation"
Korean/Norwegian-American, she's sort of embarrassed she hadn't noticed
before.) Currently, she serves as Marketing and Public Relations Director
for the Tucson Pima Arts Council. Her articles have appeared frequently in
the Tucson Weekly and Downtown Tucsonan, and her poems have appeared in such
literary publications as Colorado Review and Prairie Schooner and in her
writing group's 10th anniversary anthology The Daybreak & Willingness Club.
Karen also plays Irish and Japanese drums.

the Arts.  POG also benefits from the continuing support of The University
of Arizona Poetry Center, the Arizona Quarterly, Chax Press, and The
University of Arizona Department of English.  We also thank the following

I've been no-mail for months, and will continue to be so after perusing
recent archives (many thanks to Anselm, Julie, Joe A., etc. for reasoned
defense of poetry and poets) --
but I'm wondering if anyone would send me information on other listservs
where poetry events and publications (in North America and beyond) are
announced regularly? I miss this information.

Please backchannel.

Thanks,
Laura

my mother appears. she's thirty, we're talking she tells me my father is
going to have chemotherapy 'as a preventive measure.' i say this is non-
sense, there's nothing wrong with him, he's 90, he doesn't need anything,
it's too crippling. we're arguing like crazy, i'm crying. he's right
behind you, she says, i turn, he's napping lightly on the couch. i'm
almost hysterical now. it worked for me, she says. she's dead, the phone
rings. the homeopathic chinese herbs for the cat will cost forty cents per
pill, eighty cents a day. i don't believe in homeopathy. i've got enough
trouble. there are nazis after me, mutilated bodies. as jesus christ, i
would give my right hand to save all of mankind. i would give my right
hand as well and my other limbs. i would permit photography of the BLOODY
STUMP. as jesus christ i would absolutely do this. letters may be trans-
posed, substituted, enumerated, shifted, markov-chained, filtered, written
or rewritten according to any function. finite differences welcomed.

our craig has not updated the furniturepress.net site. we have two new pamphlets by Kevin Fitzgerald (Baltimore) and Betsy Andrews (NYC). they are very limited to 50. pretty.

this weekend in baltimore folks at the CHELA gallery put on this amazing show. they started with solicitations: everyone would send 10 copies of a poem or 10 poems that fit into a series. they packaged each poem in a small plastic bag complete with wrapping and put them on a rack. i was pretty much blown away, pretty much.

folks may play into the fact that poetry as commodity is non-existent because there really is no market for poetry; and when poetry is commoditized it has everything to do with best sellers and yr run of the mill generic "I" volumes. but just the playfulness of the idea that you could package poetry, put it on a rack, and sell it to unsuspecting passersby! i fully support the venture, i nearly went bankrupt (you wouldn't believe the steals... m. basinski even participated by contributing ten handwritten poems. thank you, michael). there were also some beautiful prints and mostly conceptual pieces [words on rocks, crumpled bits of paper with 'do not throw away: this is poetry].

really makes you realise that 'there is no money in poetry. but there is no poetry in money.' is that right? it's from [m]emory. scratch the surface.

check out the damn site and buy the pamphlets and the chaps! and ambit damnit! i have no room for this shit anymore!

oh, trades are very welcome: i'll trade my catalogue for yrs.

who's up?!

"The 'unfamiliars' come in a number of kinds of unequal consequence.
One pole of the range is occupied by those who reside in _practically_
remote (that is, rarely visited) lands, and are thereby limited in
their role to the setting of limits of familiar territory (the _ubi
leones_, written down as danger warnings on the outer boundaries of
Roman maps). Exchange with such unfamiliars (if it takes place at all)
is set aside from the daily routine and from the normal web of
interaction--as a function of a _special category_ of people (say,
commercial travellers, diplomats or ethnographers), or a _special
occasion_ for the rest. Both (territorial and functional) means of
instituted separation easily project--indeed, reinforce--the
unfamiliarity of the unfamiliars, together with their daily
irrelevance. They also guard, though obliquely, the secure homeliness
of own territory. Contrary to widespread opinion, the advent of
television, this huge and easily accessible peephole through which the
unfamiliar ways may be routinely glimpsed, has neither eliminated the
institutional separation nor diminished its effectivity. One may say
that McLuhan's 'global village' has failed to materialize. The frame
of a cinema of TV screen staves off the danger of spillage even more
effectively than tourist hotels and fenced-off camping sites; the
one-sidedness of communication firmly locks the unfamiliars on the
screen as, essentially, incommunicado." (Bauman, Modernity and
Ambivalence, 57-58).

"The Ambassador from Greece addressed an audience of 75-100 students
this morning at Tomsk Polytechnic University, reading from a prepared
text in English for the better part of an hour. There was an impromptu
aspect to the meeting, given the absence of ceremony. Among quotations
from Jose Ortega y Gasset and Hugo von Hofmannsthal, a general
European Union policy position, or disposition, was described which
included references to the threat of ethnic nationalisms and internal
security concerns with respect to terrorism in the post 9-11
world. "Meta-modern" and "postmodern" attributes accompanied the
concept of the nation-state as that governing form which finds itself
being redefined in the contemporary global economic space. Fragmented,
Europe is fragmented, it was emphasized, despite the enormous
achievement of monetary stabilization accomplished by the euro which
reflects an unprecedented level of coordination among the European
nations and their recognition that mutually dependent economies, even
when some nations benefit more than others, stand to gain more from
regulated competition than from an unregulated market economy. The end
of the paper turned to the question of culture and identified the
cultural sphere as force for social transformation, reciting a list of
oppositions or polarities belonging to European historical experience
which ended (the list, not the history itself) in the opposition
between capitalism and communism. This last word was spoken very
softly, or reluctantly, enunciated from within the perceptual frame of
asserting a common culture and history. The prospect of a United
States of Europe is far off, it was said, an idea that the European
Union was not yet ready for, but an idea as well which must be
thought. (Doesn't Bronstein use this phrase in the pamphlet, "Europe
and America"?) Que veut le capitale Americain, etc. But that was
another war, after or before. A student asked the question, Are you
saying that it is the fragmentation of Europe and the lack of a common
foreign policy which contributed to the USA's invasion of Iraq? I
didn't mention the United States anywhere in this paper, he said,
diplomatically. In his response, though, the Marshall Plan was
remembered as the rebuilding of Europe necessary for the U.S. as a
market for their exports. Mention was also made to the competition
between France and Germany, then, now? It wasn't clear. What was
clear, to this author, was the statement of need for a united
capability for defending mutually dependent economies and their shared
cultural histories. To draw any broader conclusions would be more
subjective than this brief paraphrase is willing to commit."

Note:
For Trotsky's use of the phrase, "United States of Europe," see:
http://www.marxists.org/archive/trotsky/works/1923/1923-europe.htm

"After all, we are living in 1923, and have learned a little from the
past....  What is perfectly obvious is that the customs barriers must
be thrown down. The peoples of Europe must regard Europe as a field
for a unified and increasingly planned economic life."

Kevin Magee's posts aren't announcements, and they don't utilize slander, so
I think it's ok to go ahead and read them. not to go into blurbspeak but his
work presents a stunningly valid intersection of political and poetic, of
theory and action. for furthermores, I find myself anxious to read the texts
that he cites.

Sorry to move from the poetic to the political, but this message seems =
to me to hit hard at the heart of several organizations interested in =
advancing creative efforts in their communities.=20

Dear MoveOn member,=20
Are you involved in a local or national non-profit or public interest =
organization? As a leader or board director or member? Please read this =
message carefully, because your organization could be facing a serious =
threat.=20

The Republican National Committee is pressing the Federal Election =
Commission ("FEC") to issue new rules that would cripple groups that =
dare to communicate with the public in any way critical of President =
Bush or members of Congress. Incredibly, the FEC has just issued -- for =
public comment -- proposed rules that would do just that. Any kind of =
non-profit -- conservative, progressive, labor, religious, secular, =
social service, charitable, educational, civic participation, =
issue-oriented, large, and small -- could be affected by these rules.=20

By the way, one thing FEC's proposed rules do not affect is the =
donations you may have made in the past or may make now to MoveOn.org or =
to the MoveOn.org Voter Fund. They are aimed at activist non-profit =
groups, not donors.=20

Operatives in Washington are displaying a terrifying disregard for the =
values of free speech and openness which underlie our democracy. =
Essentially, they are willing to pay any price to stop criticism of Bush =
administration policy.=20

We've attached materials below to help you make a public comment to the =
FEC before the comment period ends on APRIL 9th. Your comment could be =
very important, because normally the FEC doesn't get much public =
feedback.=20

Public comments to the FEC are encouraged by email at=20

  =
politicalcommitteestatus@fec.gov<mailto:politicalcommitteestatus@fec.gov>=
=20

Comments should be addressed to Ms. Mai T. Dinh, Acting Assistant =
General Counsel, and must include the full name, electronic mail =
address, and postal service address of the commenter.=20

More details can be found at:=20

  =
http://www.fec.gov/press/press2004/20040312rulemaking.html<http://www.fec=
gov/press/press2004/20040312rulemaking.html>=20

We'd love to see a copy of your public comment. Please email us a copy =
at FECcomment@moveon.org.=20

Whether or not you're with a non-profit, we also suggest you ask your =
representatives to write a letter to the FEC opposing the rule change.=20

Some key points:=20

- Campaign finance reform was not meant to gag public interest =
organizations.
- Political operatives are trying to silence opposition to Bush policy.
- The Federal Election Commission has no legal right to treat non-profit =
interest groups as political committees. Congress and the courts have =
specifically considered and rejected such regulation.=20

You can reach your representatives at:=20

  Senator Patty Murray
  Phone: 202-224-2621


  Senator Maria Cantwell
  Phone: 202-224-3441


  Congressman Doc Hastings
  Phone: 202-225-5816


Please let us know you're calling, at:=20

CgFfrpQ>=20

In a non-election year, this kind of administrative overreach would =
never find support. It goes far beyond any existing law or precedent. It =
is a serious threat to the fundamental checks and balances in our =
system. But because of an unholy alliance between a few campaign reform =
groups and GOP partisans, this rule change could actually happen if we =
don't act now.=20

I've attached more details below, prepared by our attorneys and by the =
FEC Working Group -- a group of more than 500 respected non-profit =
organizations.=20

If you run a non-profit, don't assume this change doesn't apply to you. =
First check out the EXAMPLES OF SPECIFIC CONSEQUENCES FOR NONPROFIT =
GROUPS section below. It's outrageous.=20

Thanks for all you do,=20

Sincerely,
--Wes Boyd

________________


EXAMPLES OF SPECIFIC CONSEQUENCES FOR NONPROFIT GROUPS=20

Under the proposed rules, nonprofit organizations that advocate for =
cancer research, gun and abortion restrictions or rights, fiscal =
discipline, tax reform, poverty issues, immigration reform, the =
environment, or civil rights or liberties - all these organizations =
could be transformed into political committees if they criticize or =
commend members of Congress or the President based on their official =
actions or policy positions.=20

Such changes would cripple the ability of groups to raise and spend =
funds in pursuit of their mission and could be so ruinous that =
organizations would be forced to back away from meaningful conversations =
about public policies that affect millions of Americans.=20

If the proposed rules were adopted, the following organizations would be =
treated as federal political committees and therefore could not receive =
grants from any corporation, even an incorporated nonprofit foundation, =
from any union, or from any individual in excess of $5,000 per year:=20

- A 501(c)(4) gun rights organization that spends $50,000 on ads at any =
time during this election year criticizing any legislator, who also =
happens to be a federal candidate, for his or her position on gun =
control measures.=20

- A "good government" organization [=A7501(c)(3)] that spends more than =
$50,000 to research and publish a report criticizing several members of =
the House of Representatives for taking an all-expense trip to the =
Bahamas as guests of the hotel industry.=20

- A fund [=A7527] created by a tax reform organization to provide =
information to the public regarding federal candidates' voting records =
on budget issues.=20

- A civil rights organization [=A7501(c)(3) or =A7501(c)(4)] that spends =
more than $50,000 to conduct non-partisan voter registration activities =
in Hispanic and African-American communities after July 5, 2004.=20

- An organization devoted to the environment that spends more than =
$50,000 on communications opposing oil drilling in the Arctic and =
identifying specific Members of Congress as supporters of the =
legislation, if those Members are running for re-election.=20

- A civic organization [=A7501(c)(6)] that spends $50,000 during 2004 to =
send letters to all registered voters in the community urging them to =
vote on November 2, 2004 because "it is your civic duty."=20

Other potential ramifications include the following situations:=20

- A religious organization that publishes an election-year legislative =
report card covering all members of Congress on a broad range of issues =
would be unable to accept more than $5,000 from any individual donor if =
the report indicated whether specific votes were good or bad.=20

- A 501(c)(3) organization that primarily encourages voter registration =
and voting among young people will be required to re-create itself as a =
federal PAC.=20

- A 501(c)(4) pro-life group that accepts contributions from local =
businesses would break the law by using its general funds to pay for any =
communications critical of an incumbent Senator's position on abortion =
rights after the Senator had officially declared himself for reelection =
more than a year before the next election.=20

- A 501(c)(3) civil rights group that has been designated as a political =
committee can no longer hold its annual fundraiser at a =
corporate-donated facility, and it must refuse donations or grants from =
donors that have already given $5,000 for that year.=20

BRIEFING ON THE PROPOSED RULE CHANGES=20

Under federal campaign finance laws, federal "political committees" must =
register and file reports with the FEC and can accept contributions only =
from individual persons (and other federal committees), and only up to =
$5,000 per year from any one donor ("hard money"). The FEC is now =
proposing to redefine "political committee" to include any group that:=20

1. Spends more than $1,000 this year on nonpartisan voter registration =
or get out the vote activity or on any ad, mailing or phone bank that =

2. Supposedly has a "major purpose" of election of a federal candidate =
as shown by:=20

(a) Saying anything in its press releases, materials, website, etc. that =
might lead regulators to conclude that the group's "major purpose" is to =
influence the election of any federal candidate; or=20

(b) Spending more than $50,000 this year or in any of the last 4 years =
for any nonpartisan voter registration or get out the vote program, or =
on any public communication that "promotes, supports, attacks or =
opposes" any federal candidate.=20

What's more, any group that gets turned into a federal "political =
committee" under these new rules has to shut down all its communications =
critical of President Bush (or any other federal candidate) until it =
sets up "federal" and "non-federal" accounts; and raises enough hard =
money contributions to "repay" the federal account for the amounts spent =
on all those communications since the beginning of 2003.=20

These proposed rules would apply to all types of groups: 501(c)(3) =
charitable organizations, 501(c)(4) advocacy organizations, labor =
unions, trade associations and non-federal political committees and =
organizations (so-called "527" groups, as well as state PACs, local =
political clubs, etc.).=20

The new rules, including those that apply to voter engagement, cover all =
types of communications -- not just broadcast TV or radio ads -- but =
messages in any form, such as print ads, mailings, phone banks, email =
alerts like this one, websites, leaflets, speeches, posters, tabling, =
even knocking on doors.=20

The FEC will hold a public hearing on April 14 & 15. Written comments =
are due by April 5 if the group wants to testify at that hearing; =
otherwise, by April 9. The FEC plans to make its final decision on these =
proposed rules by mid-May and they could go into effect as early as =
July, right in the middle of the election year, potentially retroactive =
to January 2003.=20

It's clear that these rules would immediately silence thousands of =
groups, of all types, who have raised questions and criticisms of any =
kind about the Bush Administration, its record and its policies.=20

SOME TALKING POINTS=20

- The FEC should not change the rules for nonprofit advocacy in the =
middle of an election year, especially in ways that Congress already =
considered and rejected. Implementing these changes now would go far =
beyond what Congress decided and the Supreme Court upheld.=20

- These rules would shut down the legitimate activities of nonprofit =
organizations of all kinds that the FEC has no authority at all to =
regulate.=20

- Nothing in the McCain-Feingold campaign reform law or the Supreme =
Court's decision upholding it provides any basis for these rules. That =
law is only about banning federal candidates from using unregulated =
contributions ("soft money"), and banning political parties from doing =
so, because of their close relationship to those candidates. It's clear =
that, with one exception relating to running broadcast ads close to an =
election, the new law wasn't supposed to change what independent =
nonprofit interest groups can do, including political organizations =
(527's) that have never before been subject to regulation by the FEC.=20

- The FEC can't fix the problems with these proposed rules just by =
imposing new burdens on section 527 groups. They do important issue =
education and advocacy as well as voter mobilization. And Congress =
clearly decided to require those groups to fully and publicly disclose =
their finances, through the IRS and state agencies, not to restrict =
their independent activities and speech. The FEC has no authority to go =
further.=20

- In the McConnell opinion upholding McCain-Feingold, the U.S. Supreme =
Court clearly stated that the law's limits on unregulated corporate, =
union and large individual contributions apply to political parties and =
not interest groups. Congress specifically considered regulating 527 =
organization three times in the last several years - twice through the =
Internal Revenue Code and once during the BCRA debate - and did not =
subject them to McCain-Feingold.=20

- The FEC should not, in a few weeks, tear up the fabric of tax-exempt =
law that has existed for decades and under which thousands of nonprofit =
groups have structured their activities and their governance. The =
Internal Revenue Code already prohibits 501(c)(3) charities from =
intervening in political candidate campaigns, and IRS rules for other =
501(c) groups prohibit them from ever having a primary purpose to =
influence any candidate elections -- federal, state, or local.=20

- As an example of how seriously the new FEC rules contradict the IRS =
political and lobbying rules for nonprofits, consider this: Under the =
1976 public charity lobbying law, a 501(c)(3) group with a $1.5 million =
annual budget can spend $56,250 on grassroots lobbying, including =
criticism of a federal incumbent candidate in the course of lobbying on =
a specific bill. That same action under the new FEC rules would cause =
the charity to be regulated as a federal political committee, with =
devastating impact on its finances and perhaps even loss of its =
tax-exempt status.=20

- The chilling effect of the proposed rules on free speech cannot be =
overstated. Merely expressing an opinion about an officeholder's =
policies could turn a nonprofit group OVERNIGHT into a federally =
regulated political committee with crippling fund-raising restrictions.=20

- Under the most draconian proposal, the FEC would "look back" at a =
nonprofit group's activities over the past four years - before =
McCain-Feingold was ever passed and the FEC ever proposed these rules - =
to determine whether a group's activities qualify it as a federal =
political committee. If so, the FEC would require a group to raise hard =
money to repay prior expenses that are now subject to the new rules. =
Further work would be halted until debts to the "old" organization were =
repaid. This rule would jeopardize the survival of many groups.=20

- The 4 year "look back" rule would cause a nonprofit group that =
criticized or praised the policies of Bush, Cheney, McCain, or Gore in =
2000, or any Congressional incumbent candidate in 2000 or 2002, to be =
classified as a political committee now, even though the group has not =
done so since then. This severely violates our constitutional guarantees =
of due process.=20

- These changes would impoverish political debate and could act as a de =
facto "gag rule" on public policy advocacy. They would insulate public =
officials from substantive criticism for their positions on policy =
issues. They would actually diminish civic participation in government =
rather than strengthen it. This would be exactly the opposite result =
intended by most supporters of campaign finance reform.=20

- The FEC's proposed rule changes would dramatically impair vigorous =
debate about important national issues. It would hurt nonprofit groups =
across the political spectrum and restrict First Amendment freedoms in =
ways that are unhealthy for our democracy.=20

- Any kind of nonprofit -- conservative, liberal, labor, religious, =
secular, social service, charitable, educational, civic participation, =
issue-oriented, large, and small -- could be affected by these rules. A =
vast number would be essentially silenced on the issues that define =
them, whether they are organized as 501(c)(3), 501(c)(4), or 527 =
organizations.=20

- Already, more than five hundred nonprofit organizations - including =
many that supported McCain-Feingold like ourselves - have voiced their =
opposition to the FEC's efforts to restrict advocacy in the name of =
campaign finance reform.=20

GLOBE EDITORIAL
Poetry in April
3/31/2004

WILLIAM Carlos Williams wrote that "It is difficult / to get the news
from poems / yet men die miserably every day / for lack / of what is
found there."

This news might be summed up as: How and what one feels matters a great
deal. Of course it's almost April, so it's wise to pay taxes on time and
to have earned the money being taxed in order to pay the bills and keep
the children in sandwiches and shoes. But it's also National Poetry
Month, a gimmick with the noble goal of making people stop and smell the
metaphors.

Now that daylight lingers, it's easier to see that objects and moments
have emotional echoes that might suddenly solidify into poetry -- that
great warehouse crowded with wars and love, bird-sung dawns and purple
dusks, subway rides and people eating fruit.

No need to settle for the usual thin televised entertainment. Poetry
Month means heady excess. Today in Amherst at the Emily Dickinson
Museum, revelers will start a marathon reading of all the poet's work,
almost 1,800 poems. The marathon, called "Can I expound the skies" after
a line in one of Dickinson's poems, is a first-ever event that will run
through Saturday.

Tonight the Boston Adult Literacy Fund shows off poetry's
literacy-boosting and unsung fund-raising powers with a benefit reading
featuring three poets: Martin Espada, Mary Oliver, and Kevin Young.
They'll each read some of their own work. Then they'll each read classic
poems -- including W.H. Auden's "Stop All the Clocks" and Langston
Hughes's "The Negro Speaks of Rivers." The classic works will also be
sung by the Jubilee Trio, a local group. The event has convinced
existing donors to give money and attracted new donors. Some 5,000
adults are on literacy class waiting lists.

This weekend is the fourth annual Boston National Poetry Month Festival,
hosted by the Boston Public Library and Northeastern University and
organized by the Kaji Aso Studio, an arts institute, and Tapestry of
Voices, a local organization dedicated to "weaving poetry into the
social fabric at all levels." Second-graders from Saint Margaret's
School in Dorchester will kick off the event, reciting their own and
famous poets' works. Then 56 poets will follow.

So join the party while it's noisy. Go to readings. Buy poetry books.
Replace those chain letters and here's-a-good-joke e-mails with
here's-the-best-poem-I-ever-read e-mails. Because soon May will come,
and poetry will be shuffled off the publicity stage. Fortunately, the
drive to keep the public well fed on verse will remain. The organizers
of these events dream of next year, of new poetry workshops and
contests, of events that run for a week instead of days. This is part of
the news from poems: They leave people wanting more.

Yeah, I was noticing the same thing. Poland, I said, is not host to

slump-shouldered time servers and County weasels;

You struggle with self-righteousness
and you lose.  Like your enemies
you have your hate to keep you warm;
so your wife buys you a little laughing
Buddha down in Chinatown
to pop on our computer.
You are bent over with the pressure
of simply being a moron.  You are shrinking
from the weight of your own gravity.
You are becoming your old man
as the chain-saws in the background noise
start to fan out.  First they will school you in your errors.
Then they will squash you like a bug=85=94

DADADA
by Daly, Catherine
$18.95 / PA / pp.224
Salt Publishing, 2003
ISBN: 1876857951

personal emotion and interest into experimental poetry, and visual and
sonic interest into melodramatic narrative / confessional modes. While
its main appeal is to play and pleasure, this verse may prove
challenging for beginning readers of poetry while it will interest those
who generally do not read poetry but read classics, science &
technology, experimental fiction, criticism / critical theory, and
philosophy.

A VIEW OF BUILDINGS AND WATER
by O'Brien, Geoffrey
$14.95 / PA / pp.108
Salt Publishing, 2002
ISBN: 1876857552
Poetry. This title collects poems from the last half-decade, ranging
from a monologue from an unmade film noir to a sonic sculpture where
sense is driven by sound. The narratives take their form from the
myth-making of ordinary life, partly found and partly invented out of
which we try to forge a connection between what has vanished and what is
yet to come.

the light of Tuscany to a secure unit; `The Still-Piercing Air' is sited

ISBN: 184471019X
Poetry. Edited by Alice Notley. Douglas Oliver's poetry is humorous,
beautiful, often naked. It is served by both light-of-day reasonableness
and a willful subconscious which knows the dark but can't stop playing
with language. The return of his voice in ARRONDISEMENTS will be a
pleasure for both old and new readers.

Dear Friends: I am happy to announce the launch of
Rattapallax Films with two documentaries in
production. Rattapallax Films is committed to
producing poetic films and documentaries with a social
dimension to them. More information at
http://www.rattapallax.com/films.htm

SEPTEMBER 11 (working title) is the story of two
extraordinary and horrific events that changed two
countries on September 11. It is also about the
undocumented victims of both acts. It is also about
Martín Espada, an extraordinary poet and human rights
advocate, who wrote the definitive poem about 9/11 and
his journey to Santiago to participate in the 100th
Anniversary of Chile's greatest poet -- the late Pablo
Neruda.


MAKING HEARD THE BURIED CRY celebrates the power of
the spoken-word to bridge societies as it addresses
and challenges the global pandemic, HIV/AIDS. Three
esteemed and prolific American poets/writers of color;
Yusef Komunyakaa, Willie Perdomo, and Thomas Glave,
set out to witness the growing crisis in Ghana, West
Africa. Their visits with people on the front lines of
the epidemic highlight the social/political and human
implications of the disease. Their reflections and
writings seek to understand a complacency, denial, and
stigma that transcend culture, race, and nations.

Thank You,
Ram Devineni

I am going to try to get them to spring for a case of Brooklyn Lager or something, and ignore the title--so I encourage anyone with an hour or so on Friday night between six and eight to drop by and say hello.. Some of the presses included in the chapbook exhibit are: braincase, burning deck, o-bleck, tuumba, phylum, black sparrow, meow, pressed wafer, situations, the figures, owl, city lights, broadside, skanky possum, and others!

FRIDAY - 6-8 pm - OPENING RECEPTION

Chapbook Exhibit curated by Ryan Murphy

Poets House announces

THE NEW MILLENNIUM CHAPBOOK EXHIBIT

April 2-30, 2004

Opening Reception: Friday, April 2, from 6-8

NEW YORK—Poets House, a nationally recognized literary center and home to

one of the most extensive poetry collections in the country, will host the

New Millennium Chapbook exhibit, curated by Ryan Murphy. The exhibit will be

on display throughout the month of April.

New Millennium Chapbook exhibit: While occupying the margins of the literary

world, the small press and the chapbook are often vehicles for defining

historic poetry communities and shifts in poetics. The exhibit highlights

new works published by contemporary small presses that continue this dynamic

tradition while exploring the possibilities of the chapbook form. Ryan

Murphy, who will curate the exhibit, is the author of On Violet Street, a

chapbook of poems published by the Aldrich Museum of Contemporary Art. With

Patrick Masterson, he operates A Rest Press in New York City.

Opening Celebration: The New Millenium Chapbook Exhibit will open with a

free public reception on Friday, April 2, from 6 to 8.

For more information about the New Millenium Chapbook Exhibit, please

contact Ryan Murphy at ryanmurphy17@yahoo.com, or contact Poets House at 72

Spring Street, Floor 2, New York, NY 10012, (212) 431-7920.

SATURDAY 5-7pm - OPENING RECEPTION

Annual Poets House Showcase... Featuring almost 2,000 poetry titles

published in the US since January, 2003.

NEW YORK— Every April the New York-based literary center and poetry archive

Poets House takes stock of poetry publishing nationally by mounting a

showcase of every single poetry book published in the United States during

the previous year. This year the 12th Annual Poets House Showcase presents

the 2003 harvest — from Pulitzer Prize-winning titles to handmade

chapbooks — beginning Saturday, April 3 (through April 30). "This year,

Poets House will assemble a record-breaking number of poetry books," says

Lee Briccetti, Executive Director. "The final count is not in yet, but we

expect the number of poetry books published in 2003 to exceed 2,000 — more

than double the number published a little over a decade ago, when Poets

House began its annual Showcase."

Poets House actively collects every poetry book published in the United

States. Located on Spring Street in Lower Manhattan, the library is the

largest and most comprehensive repository of American poetry open to the

public. Because all of the volumes gathered in each year’s Showcase are

later incorporated into the collection, the library now holds a virtually

complete collection of American poetry since 1990, along with other

significant holdings. Altogether, the non-profit organization makes

available to the public more than 45,000 volumes of poetry, including books,

chapbooks, literary journals,, as well as audio and video tapes, CDs, and

other forms of electronic media.

This year, Tim Kindseth, Showcase Coordinator, worked with close to 600

publishers, including commercial, university and independent presses — from

the established independents to tiny micro-presses — on the Showcase, which

Poets House launched in 1992 to help poetry readers survey the full range of

poetry published during any given year. "Poets House is the only library

systematically collecting all of the poetry published in the U.S," says Lee

Briccetti. "Our goal is to gather the entire national poetry harvest under

one roof."

The annual event has become the acknowledged barometer of poetry publishing

nationally. In the latest issue of the literary magazine, Fence (Fall/Winter

2003), Rodney Phillips calls the Showcase a "quiet extravaganza," and likens

the effect of the exhibit to that created by the "crowded walls of old

Florentine museums."

This year, concurrent with the Showcase, its pint-sized companion, the

Children’s Poetry Book Show, will exhibit hundreds of new poetry books for

children in the Poets House Children’s Room.

Briccetti says the month-long exhibit impacts the fields of poetry and

publishing in a variety of ways. Librarians visit to develop acquisition

lists; members of prize committees, to take in the field at a glance;

publishers, to scout out new voices; professors, to develop curricula; and

poets, critics, journalists, and, of course, poetry readers of all tastes,

to browse for their own pleasure and edification. "The Showcase has been

tremendously successful in raising awareness about the fantastic abundance

and diversity of poetry produced today, and also as a forum for creating

community," says Briccetti. "Neither poets nor poetry publishers turn much

of a profit," she notes. "So, poetry is always a labor of love, and it is

good to remember that we’re all laboring in the same vineyard."

The Showcase is closely linked to another important Poets House initiative,

the Directory of American Poetry Books. Information about all of the books

exhibited in the Showcase is incorporated into the Directory of American

Poetry Books, the only comprehensive bibliographic resource on American

poetry. It is available on the organization’s web site (www.poetshouse.org),

and includes well over 12,000 annotated entries, each with links to online

booksellers.

The Poets House Showcase, which is funded in part by the National Endowment

for the Arts and the New York State Council on the Arts, will be on view

from April 3 to April 30, 2004 at 72 Spring Street, 2nd Floor, NYC. Hours

are Tuesday through Friday, 11 a.m. to 7 p.m., and Saturday 11 a.m. to 4

p.m. Admission is free. The press and public are also invited to an Opening

Reception, on Saturday April 3 from 5 p.m. to 7 p.m.

For more information about the 2004 Poets House Showcase, please contact Tim

Kindseth at Poets House, 72 Spring Street, 2nd Floor, New York, NY 10012,

(212) 431-7920 x19, tim@poetshouse.org.

* * *

Poets House (www.poetshouse.org) is a 45,000-volume poetry library and a

national literary center, located in Soho. It was founded in 1985 by former

U.S. Poet Laureate Stanley Kunitz and the late Elizabeth Kray to provide

something that they felt was lacking in American cultural life: a place for

poetry — library; meeting place; locus of discussion, research, writing and

inspiration. Poets House is the only library systematically collecting all

of the poetry published in the U.S. (since 1990); maintains the online

Directory of American Poetry Books, the only comprehensive bibliographic

resource for contemporary American poetry; and produces a range of

programming that invites the public to step into the living tradition of

poetry. Poets House is located at 72 Spring Street, 2nd Floor, and is open

to the public, Tuesday thru Friday 11-7 and Saturday 11-4. Admission is

free.

Jonathan,

The First also says it's about the Power (in Buffy the Vampire Slayer, for
those who have forgotten this thread).  I think this statement is made
because, since one assumes the First is simply Evil, than what it wants to
do is about Evil.  But no.  The First has a position in the system, a
system in which good and bad must balance out (cf. Willow's resurrection
of Buffy results in a demon).  The First decides then to break the entente
cordial by trying to destroy the Slayer and the Watcher.  What it is doing
is not because it is Evil (though it is), but because it wants Power.

The system then is bipolar, but each side is shot through with the desire
for power.  You might also recall the many moments of the series where the
power Buffy has creates distance between her and her friends.

New Federal Law Overrides Gay Protections
by Paul Johnson
365Gay.com Newscenter
Washington Bureau Chief

Posted: March 31, 2004 5:01 p.m. ET
(Washington, D.C.) Legislation passed by the House of Representatives
would force universities to suspend civil rights protections or lose
government contracts. The bill denies defense-related funding to any
university which does not provide access to military recruiters and ROTC
programs.
Many universities and colleges across the country have barred recruiters
from their campuses because the ban on gays in military violates the
schools' anti-discrimination policies.

The measure, sponsored by Rep. Mike Rogers (R-Alabama) expands on a 1995
law. Under the legislation, passed 343-81, universities would also have to
give access to the Central Intelligence Agency and the National Nuclear
Security Administration in the Energy Department.It also requires that
colleges with ROTC programs submit an annual report to the Secretary of
Defense confirming they will continue to support those programs.

"[It] might just as well be called the 'Harvard Act' because it squarely
addresses the scandal of Harvard University and other schools banishing
ROTC and military recruiters from campus while turning around and cashing
Uncle Sam's checks for billions of dollars each year," said Rep.
Christopher Cox (R-California) chairman of the House Select Committee on
Homeland Security and a Harvard graduate.
"It's designed to force universities to violate their own policies against
discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation," said Rep. Martin
Meehan (D-Massachusetts).

The bill gives the Secretary of Defense the sole authority to determine if
a college is providing equal access.

"The secretary," said Rep. James McGovern (D-Massachusetts) "serves as
prosecutor, judge and jury without an independent or neutral arbiter."

The bill was also criticized by the Human Rights Campaign.
"Schools should never be forced to allow discrimination," said HRC
President Cheryl Jacques.
The legislation still requires approval in the Senate.

Controlling Interests is distributed by, and also available from, SPD.

TENNEY NATHANSON on Controlling Interests / 2004:
It’s strange to think of Charles Bernstein’s insurrectionary Controlling
Interests as a “classic,” but there (here) it is. Written in & on that
paradigmatic moment when “guacamole has replaced turkey as / the national
dish of most favor” ­ 1980, three years after the oil crisis and the
slippage of fordism toward the modular elusiveness of post-fordist
globalization ­ these texts register and report on the (local & partial)
displacement of the arduous demands of production by the diffuse injunction
to take up a “lifestyle” and consume. But they’re characterized by a
sometimes savage exuberance that hardly fits the Jamesonian mantra of the
pomo lamb lying down complacently with its late-capitalist lion. That’s
evident not only in the sometimes overt accents of critique, but also in
the pervasive madcap pleasures of bizarre one-upsmanship: no mode of
production could be more modular and mobile than this carnival of madly
compressed “turnover time.” Indeed things move fast enough that, if this
were a carousel (why not?), a lot of the fixtures & bric-a-brac of their
historical moment would go zooming off toward some asymptotic limit we
might call a horizon. What we can dimly discern there is surprising, and
makes this hyperbolically comic text also intensely moving: say Benjamin’s
angel of history, struggling to recover blown shards of the wreckage of
history (the sacred) before it’s too late; or some strange avatar of
Thoreau (courtesy of Stanley Cavell) dreaming not that the language might
be made whole ­ and make us whole ­ but that it already is (we are) if we
can hear it. Controlling Interests points us toward the communal space
articulated in those almost audible words. But it won’t let us forget that
all of it ­ junk and junket and critical juggernaut, and the words that
make and remake them­is “us” not “them.” So that: comedy, and empathy, and
hope: arm in arm, neck & neck ­ we’re off!

best explanations are his own -- much clearer than you might expect --
especially esay to follow in the SELECTED Olsen of years ago, but also
available in the more expensive and expansive collected prose ably edited by
Ben Friedlander -- Olsen especially good in his early version of the critique
of traditional humanism --

Interested in a summer in New Haven?

Rent my apartment while I'm in China.

Two-bedroom, fully furnished, including digital cable, high-speed internet,
queen-sized bed, sofa-bed, futon, a separate dining room, huge kitchen, and
lots of books to browse through.

All for the great price of $1000 a month from late May to end of August. Big
enough to hold you & your friends (could conceivably sleep up to seven
without using the floor).

Convenient location near Modern Apizza (one of New Haven's most famous
pizzerias), liquor store, gas station, a Chinese fish market, two gourmet
grocers, a laundromat, video store, and many restaurants!
