--Todd Swift is often referred to as the leading Canadian poet of his generation. His latest release, "Rue Du Regard" (DC Books, 2004), presents poems remarkable for their poignancy, humor, and formal acuity. Swift is a Modern Formalist who rides the balance between mainstream and post-avant. He lives in London and is the editor of the online journal "Nth Position". I conducted a long interview with him and its' now online at www.artrecess.blogspot.com, on the "Adam Fieled" page. Check it out....

All being is contingent,
No being is self-subsistent.
All objects are moved by others.
No object moves itself.
All beings  are caused by others.
No being is its own cause.
There is no perfect  being.
Being has no economy.

The only order of nature
Is the orderly relation

Non-personal  relations
Are by nature chaotic.
Personal relations are
The pattern  through which we see
Nature as systematic.
Homer, and all sensible
Men since, have told us again
And again, the universe -
The  great principles and forces
That move the world - have order
Only as a  reflection
Of the courage, loyalty,
Love, and honesty of men.
By  themselves they are cruel
And utterly frivolous.
The man who yields to  them goes mad,
Kills his child, his wife or friend
And dies in the  bloody dust,
Having destroyed the treasured
Labor of other men's hands.
He who outwits them survives
To grow old in his own home.

Hi everyone, if you're going to be in the Bay Area this week, I'm
writing to invite you to my book launch this Tuesday, October 4, at
City Lights at 7:00 p.m. (San Francisco).

I'll be there, Dodie will too, and Bob Gluck, and the three of us
will read briefly from the new book Suspect Thoughts has just put
out.  Come on down if you possibly can!  The book is beautiful and it
should be a fun event and I would really appreciate seeing you there.

The Wild Creatures: Collected Stories of Sam D'Allesandro, edited by
Kevin Killian

The Wild Creatures brings together all the stories of Sam
D'Allesandro, a young voice whose life was tragically snuffed out at
age 31 at the height of the AIDS epidemic in 1988. This new
collection includes all of D'Allesandro's published stories
(including those first collected in the out-of-print cult classic The
Zombie Pit) as well as unpublished stories found among D'Allesandro's
papers years after his death by his editor, the poet and novelist
Kevin Killian, who worked with the literary estate to create this
extended edition of his writing.

The Wild Creatures explores a strange terrain of urban legend, the
power of sexual obsession, and the thin line where the too-cool
becomes the too-hot. Sam D'Allesandro's focused, vivid writing is the
stuff of legend: writing so powerful it drags the reader in by the
neck.

Sam D'Allesandro, born Richard Anderson in 1956, studied at the
University of California, Santa Cruz, and came to San Francisco as a
youth in the early 1980s. He was handsome and charismatic, the man
who'd turn your head at a hundred yards. He began as a poet and
published a book of elegant lyrics called Slippery Sins. Soon he fell
in with the so-called "New Narrative" writers Robert Gl=FCck, Bruce
Boone, Steve Abbott and others, and his writing took a sharp turn
toward an extreme purity and poise. He reached out to other like
minded writers and contacted Dennis Cooper, Kathy Acker, Benjamin
Weissman, David Trinidad, and Dodie Bellamy, with whom he began an
epistolary collaboration she was later to publish as Real: The
Letters of Mina Harker and Sam D'Allesandro. At the peak of his
powers, he began to feel ill. He died of AIDS in 1988, leaving behind
a brilliant body of work that ranges from stories of one paragraph
only to fully developed novellas.

"For years I've scoured used book stores for copies of Sam
D'Allesandro's work, buying up what I could find and passing it on to
friends with the injunction: Read this. The Wild Creatures is more
than the resuscitation of a brilliant, out-of-print writer. It's that
rarest of things: a true literary event."

Calamari Press is proud to announce the publication of Land of the Snow Men

Land of the Snow Men is a collection of visionary stories and renderings

1910-12.

The journals were recovered by Norman Lock and turned into this handsome
book presented here to you. You can preview it and read some excerpts at:

You can order a copy now, directly from Calamari Press, by following the

Paolo Javier and Lyn Hejinian will read together at Small Press Traffic =
(CCA at the corner of 8th, 16th, & Wisconsin in San Francisco) on =
Friday, October 7th at 7:30 PM. Paolo Javier's new book is 60 lv =
bo(e)mbs published by O Books. Rodrigo Toscano has said about 60 lv =
bo(e)mbs: "Javier deftly develops what critical theorists have only been =
able to talk about: the birth of a non-idealist anticipatory-resilient =
para-national subject. His poetry engenders a polysemic motility that =
gives inner-life to this new state of independence." Lyn Hejinian is the =
author of many books of poetry including Happily (The Post-Apollo =
Press).

NEW FROM SHOEMAKER & HOARD:
A Faithful Existence: Reading, Memory, & Transcendence (essays)
A Faithful Existence is a thrilling, lyrical exploration of what it means to
be faithful-in the act  of translation, in scientific and spiritual inquiry,
in friendship, and in poetry.  Sensual, erudite, and  operatic in scope,
these essays pay homage to the landscape of the American South and well
beyond- to alligator snapping turtles and anti-particles, to iconoclastic
physicists and writers from various countries  and epochs, to visionary
poets and poetic hoaxes.   Forrest Gander pops the hood of the
standard-issue essay and retunes it for the 21st century, hotwiring
associations and vivid bursts of insight into the quality of immediate
experience.  Crisscrossing genres,  his focus is on perception: how do we
see and interpret, what can be compared, how do we understand  what we see,
and most importantly, how might we connect with what we feel?  His precise
and unexpected  observations on place and people allow his experiences to
resonate on a large scale.    A Faithful Existence intensifies the
connections between an ethical vision, a bodily consciousness, and a  mode
of language that might help us to survive the streams of data, the
discombobulating media, and the  predatory march of "information" that
defines our age.  Dialoguing within themselves and among each other,
Gander's essays ultimately give this collection a voice all its own.

NEW FROM NEW DIRECTIONS:
Eye Against Eye (poems)
Certainly his clearest and most accessible, this taut and memorable sixth
outing from Gander  may also be his breakout work.  One of its four
mid-length poems describes ten beautiful photographs  by Sally Mann (also
reproduced here), emphasizing their spiritual resonance as well as their
technical  flair: in a misty picture of a half-destroyed tree, "at the
border between a tangible and an intangible world,  life climbs onto death's
shoulders."  The other three mid-length poems flaunt narrative components:
"Burning  Towers, Standing Wall" (its title an allusion to 9/11 and to W. B.
Yeats) examines Mayan architecture in Mexico,  turning the visible stones,
their "mutilated stelae" and "rubbed out glyphs," into a plea for patience
in the face  of violence, and there are deliberate and ambitious poems on
the North American landscape.  Perhaps the  most powerful parts of this
powerful volume are four prose poems called "Ligatures," reactions to
difficult  moments in the poet's family life, and in the life of his teenage
son: here even the hardest domestic conflicts  finally promise emotional
reward, "as if inside experience, bright with meaning, there were another
experience,  pendant, unnamable."   --Publisher's Weekly

Re the 'response' to Katrina et al, London's Independent seems to have
gotten the scoop on the official report on the disaster inside the disaster
-  read & either weep or get angry or both.

Well, Breaking News is also showing Hammer Delay is now nailed with another
set of money laundering charges.

And we also get another career professional flak for Bush and GOP to be on
the Supreme Court!

"Evening at the Hotel de Sade"
by Brent Cunningham

The fear of death pervades us, I declared, plunging my knife into the table grain.

Don’t make me laugh, Robert replied.  Make you?  Shall we say lead me in that
direction. You jest.  Strangely not.  Then you underestimate me.

My dear Robert, said Robert (for we were both named Robert), you must admit that
within this narrow blink of existence it is common to mark our singularity with
such drama as you just exhibited; in short, for all that, we’re animals.

The very idea turns my stomach, I replied.  Does it?  It does indeed.  Please go
on, for your position fascinates me.

I did not hesitate to go on, but spoke at such extraordinary length I lost my
faith of concluding.  My friend, I concluded, you may wonder how life is for me.

Less and less, said Robert.  In general?  Au contraire.  But I’m an exceedingly
curious case.  My dear Robert!

Does it not interest you, I remarked, that I go from city to city, chased by
dogs, denying the most apparent truths imaginable?

I have specific information, said Robert, that you have never been chased by dogs...

Swelling with confidence and vigour, I rose to respond, only to discover that
twenty Roberts now swam in front of my eyes.  My legs gave out; the roast
overturned.  Dimly I heard Lucy rushing down the stairs, impossibly free of her
ropes...


"Walking around the ruin"
by Tessa Joseph

i.
There are no more movers   No more
filing in and out   Packing in layers of wax

			Start with the housefire

that jerked its leg in your throat   Start with that

saltstained river which was both enough
and not enough to move you   That door

open on a kitchen, burning oil you could smell

Start with the houses you’ve wanted   that you haven’t had

Their smokeshriveled doors   Heatbucking floorboards
Ghosts of windows where windows are gone


ii.
A crowd on a green and dripping barge   We were in procession

Through the buoyed stones   Slate walkway   Blue front door

There was a stone mantel.   We always kept things on the stairs.

Two feet   Slap the water   One instant   Perfect


iii.
There were twenty five windows
We paid for them
Paid for them   Put them there

Not like eyes   Not like anything
but windows
Like quarries, spiked deep   No

There were twenty-five windows
A shelf of little boxes
We filled them   Or not   I saw

it happen   I saw each box hinge
on flame


iv.
Small archaeology, this cellar:   tins of morphine   tool-hung wall
ancient chessgame

And the details, tiny pictures, curving voices map the last of the passages
Tell me how it is there   What it is like

I visit the river every day   and it too is small, too small

A house is the space the size of the word   it is lamp and street and bread and
rooster
and also wider, having

wider arms

As far as I know, Robin Blaser is giving a talk on Poetics tonight (October 4th) at 7PM at Poets' House 72 Spring St. New York City.  The reading of his poetry is tomorrow night by him at The Poetry Project 10th St. & 2nd Ave. at 8 PM.  The entrance fee for tonight's event is (I think) $7.  Tomorrow's event costs $8, if I remember correctly.

Actor Nipsey Russell dies at 80

Tuesday, October 4, 2005; Posted: 9:35 a.m. EDT (13:35 GMT)

NEW YORK (AP) -- Nipsey Russell, the "poet laureate of television,"
died of cancer Sunday afternoon at age 80.

The television, film and stage actor died at Lenox Hill Hospital, his
longtime manager Joseph Rapp said.

Russell was a fixture on popular television game and variety shows,
where he was welcomed for his poetic delivery. He also took his
signature four-line poetry on the road for readings and performances.

He launched his television career as Officer Anderson in the 1961
television series "Car 54, Where are You?" He also appeared in the
1994 film version.

Russell played the Tin Man alongside Diana Ross and Michael Jackson
in the 1978 film "The Wiz."

Russell also appeared in the films "Nemo" in 1984, "Wildcats" in 1986
and "Posse" in 1993.

Born in Atlanta, Georgia, he settled in New York after graduating
from the University of Cincinnati and serving as an Army captain in
Europe during World War II, Rapp said.

Russell never married. "He always said, 'I have trouble living with
myself, how could I live with anyone else,"' Rapp said. "But he was a
wonderful guy, very quiet, never bragged."

Comments: To: spidertangle <spidertangle@yahoogroups.com>
MIME-Version: 1.0

Two threads and the knot that ties them together:

Thread One:

I woke up one morning last week having had a dream of the letter
"H". This is not really noteworthy, I dream of letters all the
time. What is noteworthy, is that this particular "H" that I dreamed
had been printed in bpNichol-colored ink.

Which, of course, is the kind of thing that makes perfect sense in a
dream, but is nearly nonsense in the waking world (reason #937 to be
suspicious of the waking world).

Note the use of the word "nearly" in the preceding paragraph.

A couple of days after having had that dream of the "H" printed in
bpNichol-colored ink, I was making some potato print postcards, and
got to futzing around with pieces and parts and something wonderfuel
happened, and I ended up with something that isn't exactly what I'd
dreamed, but it's a fair enough approximation of the feel of the dream
that I'm happy with it. I made 24 prints of an "H" in bpNichol-colored
ink, and then destroyed the potato.

Thread Two:

I've spent the better part of this year really broadening and
deepening my knowledge of the work of bpNichol. In the course of that
exploration I've had the opportunity to be in contact with some of the
greatest people I've ever known. With zero exceptions, every person
I've dealt with in my searches and researches has been the kind of
helpful that exceeds even the highest expectations. I've really never
encountered, anywhere, so many people that were so helpful in so many
ways. I noticed that aspect first, because it was obvious and
unusual. The second thing I noticed was that everyone who had been so
helpful also had stories to tell. Great stories, crazy stories, funny
stories, private stories, joyful stories, sad stories, but always
there were stories being shared--human stories just given to me in
addition to whatever specific factoids I was originally seeking. Even
people who didn't know him personally had stories about how they were
affected by his work. This leads me to believe there are more stories
out there. A lot more.

The Knot:

I have 24 of these postcard-sized potato prints of an "H" in
bpNichol-colored ink. I would like to barter these postcards for
stories about bpNichol. If you send me your story, or one of your
favorite stories, and your mailing address, I'll send you one of these
postcards (until they run out).

Regards,
Dan

Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=ISO-8859-1
Content-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable

hello All,
  I have recently been reading Witold Gombrowicz's work "Ferdydurke" and =
cannot help but notice certain features of that work which seem to find =
conceptual articulation in works like "Anti-Oedipus" and "A Thousand =
Plateaus."  I wonder if anyone else has noticed this connection between =
Gombrowicz & Deleuze / Guattari, and if so, what published literature =
exists on the subject.  In the Yale University Press edition of "Ferdydurke=
," Susan Sontag mentions in her introduction that this novel appears as =
"Nietzschean" but I suspect that Gombrowicz might take a step further, =
beyond Nietzsche and into the realms of schizophrenia / schizo-analysis.  =
For example:
=20
"...a life that does not evolve in unbroken continuity from one phase to =
another is like a house that is being built from the top down, and must =
inevitably end in a schizophrenic split of the inner self."
=20
"Mankind is accursed because our existence on this earth does not tolerate =
any well-defined and stable hierarchy, everything continually flows, =
spills over, moves on..."
=20
"But it was clearly visible from the outset that the little poems, in =
their convoluted, forced, and useless art, were nothing but a complicated =
code..."
=20
A code which Gombrowicz then proceeds to purposefully scramble...
 =20
  Any guidance would be appreciated *- Thanks!
  -David Applegate.

BELLADONNA*

with

Mairead Byrne
& Stacy Szymaszek

Tuesday, October 11, 7PM
@ Dixon Place (258 Bowery, 2nd Floor—Between Houston & Prince)
Admission is $5 at the Door.

Mairead Byrne immigrated to the United States from Ireland in 1994 for
reasons of poetry. Her collection NELSON & THE HURUBURU BIRD was published
in 2003 by Wild Honey Press. Recent and upcoming publications include two
chapbooks, AN EDUCATED HEART (Palm Press 2005) and VIVAS (Wild Honey Press
2005), and poems in 5 AM, CONDUIT, DENVER QUARTERLY, and VOLT. She is the
author of two plays, two books of interviews with Irish artists, a short
book on James Joyce, and a great deal of journalism in Ireland and the
United States. She earned a PhD in Theory & Cultural Studies from Purdue
University in 2001 and lives with her two daughters in Providence, Rhode
Island, where she teaches poetry at Rhode Island School of Design.

Stacy Szymaszek is the Program Coordinator at the Poetry Project at St.
Mark's Church. Her chapbooks include Some Mariners (EtherDome Press, 2004),
Mutual Aid (gong, 2004), Pasolini Poems (Cy Press, 2005) and There Were
Hostilities (release, 2005). She is a coeditor with Instance Press and
founder and editor of Gam: A Survey of Great Lakes Writing, a project which
will be mutating into something else soon. Her book Emptied of all Ships was
published this year by Litmus Press.

Belladonna* is a feminist/innovative reading and publication series that
promotes the work of women writers who are adventurous, experimental,
politically involved, multi-form, multicultural, multi-gendered,
unpredictable, dangerous with language (to the death machinery). In its five
year history, Belladonna* has featured such writers as Leslie Scalapino,
Alice Notley, Erica Hunt, Fanny Howe, Mei-mei Berssenbrugge, Cecilia Vicuña,
Lisa Jarnot, Camille Roy, Nicole Brossard, Abigail Child, Norma Cole, Lynne
Tillman, Gail Scott and Carla Harryman among many other experimental and
hybrid women writers. Beyond being a platform for women writers, the
curators promote work that is experimental in form, connects with other art
forms, and is socially/politically active in content. Alongside the
readings, Belladonna* supports its artists by publishing commemorative
pamphlets of their work on the night of the event. Please contact us (Erica
Kaufman, Rachel Levitsky et al) at belladonnaseries@yahoo.com to receive a
catalog and be placed on our list.

Dixon Place, a home for performing and literary artists, is dedicated to
supporting the creative process by presenting original works of theater,
dance and literature at various stages of development. An artistic
laboratory with an audience, we serve as a safety net, enabling artists to
present challenging and questioning work that pushes the limits of artistic
expression. With a warm, nurturing atmosphere that encourages and inspires
artists of all stripes and persuasions, we place special emphasis on the
needs of women, people of color, youth, seniors and lesbian/gay artists. The
artist's experience is given top priority through our professional
atmosphere and remuneration, and their process is enhanced through the
reaction of our adventurous audiences. Dixon Place is a local haven for
creativity as well as an international model for the open exploration of the
process of creation. Please visit www.dixonplace.org for more information.

flowers and black berries

Belladonna* readings happen monthly between September and June.
We are grateful for partial funding by Poets and Writers, CLMP, NYSCA, and

The dream story and the potato print story were good; also the story about =
the helpful people. Tell us a bpNichol story someone told you.  Please.

Two threads and the knot that ties them together:

Thread One:

I woke up one morning last week having had a dream of the letter
"H". This is not really noteworthy, I dream of letters all the
time. What is noteworthy, is that this particular "H" that I dreamed
had been printed in bpNichol-colored ink.=20

Which, of course, is the kind of thing that makes perfect sense in a
dream, but is nearly nonsense in the waking world (reason #937 to be
suspicious of the waking world).

Note the use of the word "nearly" in the preceding paragraph.

A couple of days after having had that dream of the "H" printed in
bpNichol-colored ink, I was making some potato print postcards, and
got to futzing around with pieces and parts and something wonderfuel
happened, and I ended up with something that isn't exactly what I'd
dreamed, but it's a fair enough approximation of the feel of the dream
that I'm happy with it. I made 24 prints of an "H" in bpNichol-colored
ink, and then destroyed the potato.

Thread Two:

I've spent the better part of this year really broadening and
deepening my knowledge of the work of bpNichol. In the course of that
exploration I've had the opportunity to be in contact with some of the
greatest people I've ever known. With zero exceptions, every person
I've dealt with in my searches and researches has been the kind of
helpful that exceeds even the highest expectations. I've really never
encountered, anywhere, so many people that were so helpful in so many
ways. I noticed that aspect first, because it was obvious and
unusual. The second thing I noticed was that everyone who had been so
helpful also had stories to tell. Great stories, crazy stories, funny
stories, private stories, joyful stories, sad stories, but always
there were stories being shared--human stories just given to me in
addition to whatever specific factoids I was originally seeking. Even
people who didn't know him personally had stories about how they were
affected by his work. This leads me to believe there are more stories
out there. A lot more.

The Knot:

I have 24 of these postcard-sized potato prints of an "H" in
bpNichol-colored ink. I would like to barter these postcards for
stories about bpNichol. If you send me your story, or one of your
favorite stories, and your mailing address, I'll send you one of these
postcards (until they run out).

Regards,
Dan

Mairead,

Yes, well, hmm. I'm not sure I'm really at liberty to share other
people's stories when many of them were related to me within the
context of private emails. I did, however, cross post this note to the
spidertangle list where several people shared their stories with the
list today.

However, I think I'm safe to pass along one of my favorites, so far,
since even though I originally heard it privately, a version that is
essentially the same is available on Karl Young's (excellent and
highly recommended) Light & Dust site at:

http://www.thing.net/~grist/l&d/bpnichol/bpsh.htm

excerpt written by Karl Young which contains the story follows:

"Most poets go through a phase in which they tinker with
photocopiers. bpNichol and I were fanatics in the pursuit of creative
xerography. This included phoning each other to report on new things
we were doing, and new machines we were working with; trying things
out for each other on machines in different cities, and so
forth. Sharp Facts was his only TTA related book in this mode to see
print.

"Print in this case meant an offset cover, introduction, and title
pages -- the rest was done on photocopiers during two days in February
of 1980. The machines used were in public places, and this created
some confusion among people around us, though, fanatics that we, were,
it was definitely a high for both of us. At one point we were working
on the only photocopier in a building and had a line of maybe half a
dozen people behind us. One fellow in the impatient line behind us
asked "what the hell you guys doing, printing a book?" bp and I turned
at precisely the same time, said "ya" in perfect synchronization, and
turned back to the machine just as mechanically, though both of us
laughing at how much like the machine we were working on we had
become."

Thanks for asking,
Dan

Dear All,

For my BLURBED BOOK PROJECT, I have received, to date, 150 blurbs in eight
days.  You can see them at http://blurbproject.blogspot.com

Thanks to those who have participated and please continue to send blurbs: I
receive all these blurbs and then wiill write a single book that will aptly fit
to all of them.  Though I am always happy to receive your praise (and
disdains), I am equally delighted to receive your efforts to make my writing life
hell, e.g. like an unironic conjoining of war-torn Europe with Antarctica's
penguins, a double-sestina thrown in the middle, per the blurb from Aldon Nielsen.

I'm also writing this because, feeling stunned at everyone's generosity, I
now offer blurbs for sale.  If you are a writer and need a blurb for any of your
upcoming books, those by Jukka-Pekka Kervinen are for sale (simply substitute
your name and book title) for a modest donation for hurricane relief efforts.
 More info on this at my primary blog, http://chatelaine-poet.blogspot.com

Thanks for your time,
Eileen Tabios

wanted to write.

Nada and I will be talking, showing slides (mostly of comics), playing
excerpts of music and film, reading poetry, and having poets read, at a talk
on manifestations of "outrageous otherness" at the Small Press Traffic
Literary Arts Center at CCAC a week from tomorrow, October 14, at 7:30 PM.
SPT/CCAC is in San Francisco, on the corner of 8th and Irwin at Wisconsin
Street.

Here is the draft outline listing some of the artists, singers, poets, and
directors we'll be talking about & providing samples of, which we've broken
down into subsections, to give you an idea of what we'll be presenting:

1. EXAGGERATION
Sakura Maku, Tom Hart, Screamin Jay Hawkins, Natacha Atlas, Pérez Prado,
Rodney Koeneke, Fukasaku Kinji, Cheick Oumar Sissoko, Kathy Acker, Los Bros
Hernandez, Suehiro Maruo

2. MELODRAMA
David Larsen, Raj Kapoor, Najwa Karam, Asala Nasri, Jòj Kastra, Dambudzo
Marechera, r.a. washington, Artistophane Boulon

3. REVERB
Jessica Abel, Manmohan Desai, Shekar Kapur, Alexi Kruchenykh, Gu Cheng,
Michael Magee, Murat Nemet-Nejat

4. PAROXYSMS & CONTORTION
Stacy Doris, V. Shantaram, Adeena Karasick, Chitra Ganesh, Drew Gardner

5. INGENUOUSNESS
bill bissett, Madison Clell, Ernst Herbeck, Puffy, K. Silem Mohammad

Some of the names above may be unfamiliar to you. They include: poets from
China, Haiti, Zimbabwe, Russia, Canada, Germany, Turkey, and the U.S.;
filmmakers from Japan, Mali, and India; cartoonists from the U.S., Japan,
Guadeloupe, and India; and singers from Lebanon, Syria, Cuba, Indonesia,
Japan, the U.S., and Italy.

We may have to cut some for reasons of time, or we may add a few things if
we can squeeze them in without this getting completely out of hand. If
you're in San Francisco on October 14, we hope to see you there!

Landing in my mailbox this week is the new OXFORD ANTHOLOGY OF AFRICAN AMERICAN
POETRY, a lovely book with many wondrous poems, though I will surely not be the
only one to think the editors cast a very small net indeed -- more of a
problem, the words of the editors (Rampersad & Herbold) -

what can I even say about a sentence such as this:

"The Depression saw little poetry, except for the work of Hughes and Sterling
Brown . . . "

guess it all depends on the meaning of "little" --

and then there's the matter of their awarding Baraka a degree he never got, this
more than two decades after Baraka set the record straight rather firmly in his
autobiography.

oh well . . . .

forthcoming from Atelos this year. He lives in San Francisco, works in

providence of paranoia, a series of essays on echoes, and the editorship
of a hypothetical book series exploring rhythmic architecture and land-use
melodrama. He would prefer not to.

Buskeroo Bonsai and the Eighth Dimension are also known as the ukulele duo.

Donna de la Perri=E8re's poems have appeared in Agni, American Letters and
Commentary, Colorado Review, Denver Quarterly, Five Fingers Review, First
Intensity, The New England Review, New American Writing, Talisman, Volt, an=
d

Lease "among the most accomplished and provocative poets of his generation.=
"

elsewhere. Lease is Associate Professor of Writing and Literature at
California College of the Arts.

With Silvertone in hand, San Francisco soloist Julie Napolin sows
the fallow fields of love and longing, singing hummable tales of a lasting
genus.  Her driving rhythms and shimmering tones guide airy vocals that
beckon you near.

Jill Stengel is the editor of a+bend books and the new poetry magazine mem,
which features work from poets mothering young children and a Page Mother.
She is the author of the chapbook Ladies with Babies (Boog Literature).

During Robin Blaser's blissful reading at St. Mark's
in nyc last night he remarked that Robert Creeley (who
was on the phone with him the day before he died,
speaking about the introduction he was writing for the
new Blaser collection to come) had concluded that the
two of them were the last ___________, but I didn't
catch what the word was.  He repeated it again, but
the word still evaded my ears.

was on the phone with him the day before he died,
speaking about the introduction he was writing for the
new Blaser collection to come) had concluded that the
two of them were the last ___________, but I didn't
catch what the word was. He repeated it again, but
the word still evaded my ears.

Bp always conceived his Probable Systems as a particular contributing to
Canadian "Pataphysics which self-inaugurated in the early 80s (if I
remember correctly in Open Letter 4th series nos. 6-7 Winter 1980-81).
I've been working casually on a genealogy of the letter that seeks to
contextualize his own theory.  One of bp's great maxims was that "the word
should be understood as a compound expression of a single letter."  H for
him carried many resonances.  He lived on "H Street" in Winnipeg  and
thought it the ideal ideogram of union.  (It haunts Saussure's diagram of
communication printed in the Course on General Linguistics.)  H, of course
enjoys a maverick singularity, situates between pure vowel and pure
consonant as an aspirant, a fact which Jacob Boehme leaps on in his
Mysterium Magnum. when he   "But that the ancient wise men, skilful in this
tongue, did interpose and H in the name JEOVA, and called it JEHOVA, the
same was done with great understanding, for the H maketh the holy name with
the five vowels ["J" of course is "I" just as "V" is "U"] even manifest in
the outward nature.  It sheweth how the holy name of God doth breath[e]
forth and manifest itself even in the creature."

PYRAMID ATLANTIC SPECIAL PROJECT =E2=80=9CPAGE AS STAGE=E2=80=9D

PYRAMID ATLANTIC ART CENTER, SILVER SPRING, MARYLAND

LECTURE--THE =E2=80=9CVISUAL=E2=80=9D AND THE =E2=80=9CPOETRY=E2=80=9D =
IN VISUAL POETRY

WARD TIETZ Oct. 7, 7:00 p.m.

This lecture will give an overview of ''Visual'' Poetry, its history, =20=

and its more recent manifestations in print and electronic form.  =20
Special emphasis will be given to how a text or poem becomes =20
''visual'' or pictorial while retaining its verbal character.

WORKSHOP--WORD IMAGE DIGITAL PRINTING

BRAD FREEMAN AND WARD TIETZ--Oct. 8 & 9 from 9:30 - 4:00
$220 (members: $205 | $30 materials fee).  In this workshop, we will =20
explore the various =E2=80=9Cpresentational=E2=80=9D strategies that can =
come into =20
play when working artistically with printed words and images.  =20
Generally, the presentation of words and images must respond to =20
standards maintained within the culture at large, standards we find =20
in magazines, newspapers, books, poster, billboards, even television, =20=

film and, now, the Internet, which, through their standardization and =20=

general availability, help define the horizon of our expectations in =20
artistic use.  To work artistically, we must work with and against =20
these tacit standards to make an artistic work that is interesting or =20=

surprising.  To that end, we will look at some examples and =20
experiment with a range of =E2=80=9Cpresentational=E2=80=9D strategies =
in our own =20
compositions of word and image, and as a group, we will try to =20
measure their artistic or poetic potential.  This workshop is a great =20=

opportunity to work with both typographical forms and images of all =20
kinds. We will be especially interested in how the size, placement =20
and color of letter-forms can interact with photographic images and =20
drawings.  While we will work primarily in digital formats, other =20
techniques such a rubber-stamping and collage will also be used.

Brad Freeman is a book artist, photographer and printer with much =20
experience using Photoshop as an art-making and pre-press tool.  He =20
has facilitated the production of numerous artist books since 1985, =20
while working at the Visual Studies Workshop, Pyramid Atlantic and =20
Nexus Press.  He is the founder of JAB - the Journal of Artists' Books.

Working in a variety of media, from sculpture to works on paper, Ward =20=

Tietz has exhibited and performed his work in festivals, art centers, =20=

and museums in the United States and Europe since the late 1980s.  He =20=

presently teaches in the English Department at Georgetown University, =20=

Washington, DC, where he is also Director of the Georgetown Poetry =20
and Seminar Series.

Since the Peace March in San Francisco, my blog has taken a picturesque
turn, which is to say combining pictures - primarily off my local and
downtown streets - and then letting the picture(s) become a way for one kind
of writing or other to push forth - or sometimes no writing at all.
Most recent images include a Rose, a basketball hoop (an oblique memory of
Bob Creeley), an abandoned, cracked up sculpture, a Day of the Dead Door, a
simulated Mondrian "de truck", and a very fresh, dark, car engine fire.

A kind of flaneuring - or is it improving? - where the picture becomes "a
passage."

Feedback, as usual, appreciated.

--------------------------------------------

Above the world-weary horizons
New obstacles for exchange arise
Or unfold,
O ye postmasters!

*
1. About the Poetics List*

With the preceding epigraph, the Poetics Listserv was founded by Charles
Bernstein in late 1993. Now in its fourth incarnation, the list has
about 1200 subscribers worldwide. We also have a substantial number of
nonsubscribing readers, who access the list through our web site (see
archive URL above).

The Poetics List is not a forum for a general discussion of poetry or
for the exchange of poems. Our aim is to support, inform, and extend
those directions in poetry that are committed to innovations,
renovations, and investigations of form and/or/as content, to the
questioning of received forms and styles, and to the creation of the
otherwise unimagined, untried, unexpected, improbable, and impossible.
While we recognize that other lists may sponsor other possibilities for
exchange, we request that those participating in this forum keep in mind
the specialized and focused nature of this project and respect our
decision to operate a moderated list. The Poetics List exists to support
and encourage divergent points of view on innovative forms of modern and
contemporary poetry and poetics, and we are committed to do what is
necessary to preserve this space for such dialog.

Due to the high number of subscribers, we no longer maintain the open
format with which the list began (at under 100 subscribers). The
specific form of moderation that we employ is a relatively fluid one: in
most cases, messages are reviewed after having been posted to the list,
and difficulties resolved on that basis; however, the listserv editorial
board may shift between this and a pre-review mode which calls for all
messages to be read and approved before being forwarded to the list. We
prefer to avoid this option as it hampers the spontaneity of discussion
that we hope to promote. In addition to these options, the editorial
board will unsubscribe individuals if they are not, in our opinion,
productively contributing to the list or following our guidelines. We
remain committed to this editorial function as a defining element of the
Poetics List.

Please also note that this is a private list and information about this
list should not be posted to other lists or directories of lists. The
idea is to keep the list membership to those with specific rather than
general interests, and also to keep the scale of the list relatively
small and the volume manageable. The current limits of the list are
generally 50 messages per day, and one or two messages per subscriber
per day; but these limits are subject to change withouth notice.

In addition to being archived at through the EPC
(http://epc.buffalo.edu) and at
http://listserv.acsu.buffalo.edu/archives/poetics.html, some posts to
Poetics (especially reviews, obituary notices, announcements, etc.) may
also become part of specific EPC subject areas. Brief reviews of poetry
events and publications are always welcome; we also encourage posts that
announce events important to our subscribers. See section 5 for details.

Note also that Roof Books published Joel Kuszai's edited collection of
the Poetics List; this is available from ROOF
<http://www.roofbooks.com/Book/index.cfm?GCOI=93780100631100>and also on
line at the EPC. <http://epc.buffalo.edu/presses/roof/>

*2. Posting to the List*

The Poetics List is a moderated list. All messages are reviewed by the
editors in keeping with the goals of the list as articulated in this
Welcome Message (see section 1).

Please note that while this list is primarily concerned with discussions
of poetry and poetics, messages relating to politics and political
activism, film, art, media, and so forth are also welcome. We strongly
encourage subscribers to post information, including web links, relating
to publications (print and internet), reading series, and blogs that
they have coordinated, edited, published, or in which they appear. Such
announcements constitute a core function of this list. Brief reviews of
poetry events and publications (print or digital) are always welcome.

We do not accept postings of creative work not directed toward a
discussion of poetics issues on the list. The Poetics List is not a
venue for the posting of free-standing, personal poems or journal entries.

Also, please note that the Poetics List is not a "chat" list and we
discourage the posting of  very short messages intended for only a few
subscribers.

Subscribers only may post to the Poetics List. Send messages directly to
the list address: poetics@listserv.buffalo.edu.

*
3. Subscriptions*

*For all subscription requests go to
http://listserv.acsu.buffalo.edu/archives/poetics.html.

*To subscribe for the first time click on "Subscribe (join) a List."
Immediately following your subscription to the poetics listserv we ask
that you email poetics@buffalo.edu, subject-line "registration," with
your full name, street address, email address, and telephone number.
Failure to register at the time of subscription will result in automatic
deletion from the subscription roll.

*To manage your subscription (for descriptions of the different
subscription options please see section 3), click on "Subscriber's Corner."

Subscriptions to the Poetics List are free of charge, but formal
registration is required. All other questions about subscriptions,
whether about an individual subscription or subscription policy, should
be addressed to this same administrative address.

PLEASE NOTE: All subscription-related information and correspondence
remains absolutely confidential.

All posts to the list must provide your full real name, as registered.
If there is any discrepancy between your full name as it appears in the
"from" line of the message header, please sign your post at the bottom.
Subscribers who do not include their full name with each post will be
unsubcribed form the list.

The most frequent problem with subscriptions is bounced messages. If
your system is often down or if you have a low disk quota, Poetics
messages may get bounced, which will result in your subscription being
automatically terminated by the Listserv program and the automatically
generated message telling you that this has occurred will also likely
bounce. If this happens, you may re-subscribe to the list by the same
process described above. One remedy to avoid this happening in the
future: set your list options to "no-mail" and read the list on the web.



*4. Subscription Options*

We encourage you to alter your subscription options via the link on the
right side of the screen at
http://listserv.acsu.buffalo.edu/archives/poetics.html. If you would
prefer not to use the web-interface, you may also email
<listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu> the following commands:

*to subscribe to the Poetics listserv send listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu
this one-line message with no "subject": sub poetics [your Firstname and
Lastname]

*RECOMMENDED: if you wish to read the list on our web interface and not
receive any messages sent directly, while remaining subscribed to the
list and so eligible to send us posts, send this one-line message to
<listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu> with no "subject": set poetics nomail.
Note: this option is also useful for temporary suspension of email service.

*to reactivate Poetics e-mail send <listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu> this
one-line message with no "subject": set poetics mail

* to receive the list in digest form (you will receive the day's
individual posts in one email sent just after midnight EST), send
<listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu> this one-line message with no "subject":
set poetics digest

*to receive posts in the default option (you will receive individual
postings immediately), send <listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu> this one-
line message with no "subject": set poetics nodigest

* to receive the list in index form (you will receive a list, without
the text of the posts, of the subjects discussed each day along with the
author's name and address and the number of lines it comprises; you can
also choose to have the index sent to you in either plain text or in
HTML format with hyperlinks), send <listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu> this
one-line message with no "subject": set poetics nohtml index --or-- set
poetics html index

PLEASE NOTE: do not leave your Poetics subscription in default or digest
mode if you are going to be away for any extended period of time. Your
account may become flooded and you may lose Poetics messages as well as
other important mail. In such cases, switch your subscription to
"nomail" as recommended above.



*5. To Unsubscribe*

To unsubscribe (or change any of your subscription options), again, we
strongly encourage you to go to the right-hand side of the screen at
http://listserv.acsu.buffalo.edu/archives/poetics.html You may also may
unsubscribe by sending a one-line email to
<listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu> with no "subject": unsub poetics

If you are having difficulty unsubscribing, please note: sometimes your
e-mail address may be changed slightly by your system administrator. If
this happens you will not be able to send messages to Poetics or to
unsubscribe, although you will continue to receive mail from the Poetics
List. To avoid this problem, unsub using your old address, then
resubscribe with your new email address.

*6. Cautions*

"Flame" messages will not be tolerated on the Poetics List. We define
'flaming' as any post that resembles a personal attack or personal
insult to anyone--subscriber or not. This of course includes racial
slurs as well as ad hominem arguments in which the person rather than
their work is attacked; in other words while critique of a person's work
is welcome (critical inquiry is one of the main functions of the list),
this critique cannot extend to a critique or criticism of the person.

The listserv is intended to be a productive communal space for
discussion and announcements; as such, subscribers who do not follow
listserv policy on flaming will be removed from the subscription roll.

For reasons of basic security, we do not allow pseudonymous
subscriptions. All messages intended for the Poetics List should be sent
in Text-Only format, without attachments. We do not accept
HTML-formatted messages or attached files. As a general rule, keep
individual posts to 1,000 words or less.

Please do not publish list postings without the express permission of
the author. Posting on the list is a form of publication. Copyright for
all material posted on Poetics remains with the author; material from
this list and its archive may not be reproduced without the author's
permission, beyond the standard rights accorded by "fair use" of
published materials.

All material on the Poetics List remains the property of the authors;
before you reproduce this material, in whole or in part, we ask that you
get permission (by email is fine) from the authors. If they give
permission, then we ask only that you say that the post or posts
appeared originally on the Poetics List
(http://epc.buffalo.edu/poetics/welcome.html) on [give date and say:]
Used by permission of the author.

As an outside maximum, we will accept no more than 2 messages per day
from any one subscriber. Also, given that our goal is a manageable list
(manageable both for moderators and subscribers), the list accepts 50 or
fewer messages per day.

Like all systems, the listserv will sometimes be down: if you feel your
message has been delayed or lost, *please wait at least one day to see
if it shows up*, then check the archive to be sure the message is not
posted there; if you still feel there is a problem, you may wish to
contact the editors at <poetics@acsu.buffalo.edu>.

THE MOSQUITO
By Phan Van Tri

O mosquito, you're blessed with all nice things!
What do you lack? Why buzz and still complain?
You've rested on jade mats and ivory beds.
You've stroke and kissed rouged lips or powdered cheeks.
You've spared no children, pampering your mouth.
You've hurt poor people, glutting up your paunch.
When a good swatter someday comes to hand,
I'll pay you for your crimes without a blink!
(Vietnam)



They hang the man and flog the woman
That steal the goose from off the common,
But let the greater villain loose
That steals the common from the goose.

".....at a time when I am speaking to you about the paradox of desire -- in
the
sense that different goods obscure it -- you can hear outside the awful
language
of power.  There's no point in asking whether they are sincere or
hypocritical,
whether they want peace of whether they calculate the risks.  The dominating
impression as such a moment is that something that may pass for a prescribed
good; information addresses and captures impotent crowds to whom it is poured

forth like a liquor that leaves them dazed as they move toward the slaughter
house.
One might even ask if one would allow the cataclysm to occur without first
giving
free reign to this hubbub of voices...."

the moment patsy cline wraps her voice around your head it's time. you
choose a day to change everything. for the people who have seen you holy.
the great scaffolding. the excellent menace. apples run uphill. how do
paintings start. how do poems start. not that it matters, but if it did.
what begins a beginning. the threads hanging off a simplicity you recall. a
cursive map. up when up comes upper vitalities up then up. an apartment of
trees. the difficulty of where’s next. help writing, helpful writing. you
are inside this. now. suppose the fence is made of paper and there's print
on it and we read and read and it never dawns to step over. how does one go
about disintegrating. the moment before disintegrating. you can walk through
water not on water. applause, a fine way for hands to meet. the future moves
away. from here. be open, but close the windows. part of me is more friendly
than most. their lips move like a pleasure craft. very little of the enemy
remains. what elation these colors, these foods yr fingers run over. a
whisperer says yr name from the other side of the room. no office supply
will adjust to accommodate yr needs. the people meet in a vest - insist you
consist of small piles each more of a nicety than the other - and then
without blinking the void engulfs. they slip into the most main of streams.
think of large concert halls. a man through torture finds the way to
newness. what we control controls us. no other equation relates when you
walk into this mistake. foreheads touch all in the sky. lips quiver for a
second, but nothing disturbs the links. it's all about fucking. a bunny, a
big ass bunny talking about eyebrows. breeze crazy eyebrows. a cylinder
thwacked. graffiti monkey breath stenciled across the forehead of yr new
nutty friend. working the scaffold of getting there. shaky abundance of yr
top. it's such a new book. the demise of units we understand. no bump in
clouds we call mercy among the collapsing fleshier part of our staring. one
embankment for staving off. it's a sheet of doing. amnesia seeped
repetition. no other calamity soaked remains of the counter. some forthright
apostle waits to unfold origami delight. crumpled allegiance dissolves upon
listening. a classic departure wafting through yr fingers. a hair-shaking
event. clinging and wakeful, it inches across the day. a brilliant
misunderstanding dressed in forgotten animal pelts. the portable encryption.
destined obstacles written from speech. flamboyant mythology. a dismal
reincarnation me being here. a diagonal force depletes it. sine wave full of
momentum. clavicle derived moisture. the epaulettes balance across the
shoulders. a swimmable gap. it's been orchestrated and no one rescues you
from oblivion, because it's the good kind. from here i can acquire. as in i
live nearby, so static is minimized to walking. as line drawings seem to
last forever. the ignition key turned. the people who have seen you holy.
beyond belief. the hedge bedazzled. thrown triplicate in the sky aerobics.
drenched in blood paragraphs. hand written strokes meandering in the brain.

having expertise is an absent minded invention.  time has no narrative or
whatever  sadness is peeled back is one of a thousand walls.  the secretion
of information. one diligent slice curtails historical commodities. time is
the reflector, a breath inside the megalopolis. a tinkerer views the palace
in an instant. a jungle of conduits in a troubled geography. the sideways
party suspends time. these are the magnets. a hat you search for. whatever
delirium there is is housed in repetition. time widens. what protrudes is
the dance of night and day. smaller animals are part of the palace. a subtle
tumble and distinct punch in the stomach of a robot’s heart. delicate,
intricate  drawings vaguely replicate  the circumstance that inebriates the
fabric of time. the forgotten peripheral schematic. all we see are
parentheticals. a throbbing between  extremities.  there is no position, no
mapped position that connotes its opposite. a radio dialed askew and middle
minded. a thumbnail of joy and perfect oblivion. voices on the high end. the
megaphone purports miniature permanence. constant textured loops of weather.
  ebullient children in the yard as an aside. facsimiles, tenured
facsimiles. the honed focus of rummaging the palace. the theatre plays the
movie people are accustomed to seeing. a jugular arch and blood painted
occurrence moistened by this situation. a most pleasant alarm. a jewel  in a
box left to shelve. a palace emptied. time according to M.F.

The first winner of the Emily Dickinson First Book Award, a
volume of Landis Everson's new and collected poems,
Everything Preserved: Poems 1955-2005, ed. by Ben Mazer, will
soon be published by Graywolf Press. In addition, Everson
received a cash prize of $10,000.

Everson was a member of the Berkeley Renaissance of the late
1940s, and participated in a weekly writing group with Jack
Spicer and Robin Blaser in San Francisco in 1960. Since his
rediscovery last year in Fulcrum 3 (The Berkeley Renaissance,
edited by Ben Mazer), he has written a great deal of new
poetry, which is now appearing or forthcoming in American
Poetry Review, Chicago Review, Fence, Fulcrum, Harvard
Review, Jacket, LIT, New Republic, PN Review, Poetry, Seneca
Review, Washington Square, and many other journals.

Read more about Everson and the Award at
http://poetryfoundation.org/release_100705.html
and watch the New York Times for more extensive coverage.

Copies of Fulcrum 3 (including Ben Mazer's feature on the
Berkeley Renaissance, where Landis Everson was rediscovered)
are still available to individuals at $15 ($25 abroad).
Fulcrum 4, similarly priced and forthcoming in exactly one
week, contains a special feature on Everson, including his
letters to Jack Spicer and Robert Duncan, a range of new
poems, and an essay by Ben Mazer, "The Landis Everson Story."

In reading Zuk=B9s =B3A=B2 closely, I find this work indispensable. Of course, I
find, any religious kind of absorption in any =B3A=B2 annotation as an exclusiv=
e
=B3key=B2 to the realm (or the =8Crealm=B9 of one line) will fall unilaterally upon
its face when juxtaposed with the next line, but, then again, resonate with
another line, and provoke insight, say 30 lines hence. This guy (Zuk) at hi=
s
best is swifter than Chaplin in a feint, or series of such -
Particularly as his marbles loosen up and fully unleash in A-22 and A-23.
I suspect the world of Z readers divides into two groups =AD the fully
absorbed and the fully oppositional in A-22 & A-23.

Poetics List --

I am forwarding this account (with Jerry Ward's permission).  One of
the more personal, specific accounts of the ongoing post-Katrina
process.  Jerry is a superb poet and scholar; long-time faculty member
at Tougaloo College, now a professor at Dillard.  A long-time friend,
Jerry is also a board member of the Modern and Contemporary Poetics
Series.

I am struck by the loss of books and manuscripts -- and hope to help
Jerry replace some of these books once he has re-settled.

Return to New Orleans: Executive Summary 9/06/05
By way of prelude
You can go home again. It would be my first trip into New Orleans
since I evacuated myself on August 28. I did know what to expect. A
colleague from Dillard University, then in Houston, was almost certain
that my house had water damage. Television had supplied a surplus of
dreadful pictures of the Big Easy as the American Venice and of those
citizens who did not leave as well-to-do and defiant or as poor and
stress-stricken. Newspapers, magazines, and online journals force-fed
me what I should believe. Chakula cha Jua was thoughtful: he sent an
interactive site that allowed me to see aerial views of my house and
neighborhood. Dave Brinks, a brave, purposeful poet, made a site visit
to my house, confirming that I had little damage that he could
see. “Come home , “ he said, “as soon as you can. It is crucial that
we begin rebuilding immediately. “ Raymond Breaux, in a deadpan voice,
stirred all my anxieties when he said New Orleans as we knew it does
not exist. He echoed what Tyrone and Tina Albert said after their
visit a week earlier. I was well prepared to be unprepared.
The Findings for 1928 Gentilly Blvd., New Orleans, LA 70119
1) The roof suffered little damage and the ceilings have no water
stains
2) 3-5 inches of water flooded the house. The carpets were soaked. The
wooden flooring buckled. These must be removed and replaced. The
marble tile must be cleaned and treated. The detached garage and
workshop was flooded; any books in those areas were destroyed.
3) The 24 windows suffered no damage.
4) All rooms in the house must be treated to eradicate as much mold as
possible. Removing mold must take place immediately to prevent further
damage, especially to books.
5) The refrigerator, hot water heater, washer and dryer must be
replaced.
6) Paneling in the kitchen and den areas, the interior and exterior
doors and some furnishings (dressers, beds in the master bedroom and
guest room) must be replaced
7) To ensure that there are no electrical accidents when the house is
inhabited again, it should be completely rewired; the attic, where
most of the wiring is located was not inspected.
8) The room used as an office sustained losses that will cause Mr.
Ward to be in agony for months. He will grieve over the loss of his
two-volume Oxford English Dictionary. Many reference books,
autographed books, papers pertaining to the Richard Wright
Encyclopedia and the Cambridge History of African American Literature,
Ward’s manuscripts for Reading Race Reading America, Hollis Watkins:
An Oral Autobiography, and To Shatter the Iris of Innocence (poetry)
are beyond recovery.
The same is true for some videotapes. The PC and hard drive, 35mm
camera, tape recorder, vacuum cleaner, some photographs and the rare
Black Box tapes are ruined. Manuscript materials from Tom Dent and
Lance Jeffers and Chakula cha Jua were not damaged.
9) Most of Ward’s clothing and shoes have to be replaced; the mold
damage is severe.
10) Ward is luckier by far than 89% of the residents whose homes
suffered wind and water damage.
Tentative conclusion: Yes, Margaret, “A race of men shall rise and
take control”
I am far luckier , thank God, than 89% of my fellow New Orleanians. I
have been blessed by the prayers of my relatives and friends. My
fortunate circumstances strengthen my resolve to return permanently,
to restore my house, to help to restore Dillard University and other
educational institutions, to join Dave Brinks and others in grassroots
efforts to prevent the NEW New Orleans from becoming a “corporate
colony” with a minimal non-white population that is controlled by
wealthy and extreme neo-conservatives. I must encourage more people to
return. The natural disasters that are now elements of a national
tragedy persuade me to fight a repetition of the Reconstruction era
and the nadir of African American experiences, to speak loudly against
a replay of the Great Migration. Commitments must gradually erase the
depression and periods of near-insanity that have afflicted me since
August
29 2005. I must devote myself to the practice of civic virtue in New
Orleans.

Jerry W. Ward, Jr.

Jerry's point below needs to be echoed!
Here's something from THE BAY VIEW

HUD Chief: "New Orleans is not going to be as black as it was for a long
time, if ever again," Housing and Urban Development Secretary Alphonso
Jackson told the Houston Chronicle editorial board....

"I wish the so called Black leadership would stop running around this
country, like Jesse and the rest of them, making this a racial issue," the
HUD chief complained.....

Whereas New orleans' population before Katrina was 67 percent Black,
Alphonso Jackson predicted that only 35 to 40 percent of the post-Katrina
population would be black. "I'm telling you, as Hud secretary and having
been a developer and a planner, that's how it's going to be," he said.

The article, Gentrification through Genocide," is in 10/5 edition of Bayview
www.sfbayview.com

And feel free to check out the Continuous Peasant New Orleans benefit
song--it's called "where were you yesterday?"
at www.myspace.com/continuouspeasant or at www.musicforamerica.org

It's free to listen to, but if you want to download it all monies will go
to the Vanguard People's Hurricane Relief Fund (significantly, NOT the Red
Cross)

stress-stricken. Newspapers, magazines, and online journals force-fed=20
me what I should believe. Chakula cha Jua was thoughtful: he sent an=20
interactive site that allowed me to see aerial views of my house and=20
neighborhood. Dave Brinks, a brave, purposeful poet, made a site visit=20
to my house, confirming that I had little damage that he could=20
see. "Come home , " he said, "as soon as you can. It is crucial that=20
we begin rebuilding immediately. " Raymond Breaux, in a deadpan voice,=20
stirred all my anxieties when he said New Orleans as we knew it does=20
not exist. He echoed what Tyrone and Tina Albert said after their=20
visit a week earlier. I was well prepared to be unprepared.
The Findings for 1928 Gentilly Blvd., New Orleans, LA 70119
1) The roof suffered little damage and the ceilings have no water=20
stains
2) 3-5 inches of water flooded the house. The carpets were soaked. The=20
wooden flooring buckled. These must be removed and replaced. The=20
marble tile must be cleaned and treated. The detached garage and=20
workshop was flooded; any books in those areas were destroyed.
3) The 24 windows suffered no damage.
4) All rooms in the house must be treated to eradicate as much mold as=20
possible. Removing mold must take place immediately to prevent further=20
damage, especially to books.
5) The refrigerator, hot water heater, washer and dryer must be=20
replaced.
6) Paneling in the kitchen and den areas, the interior and exterior=20
doors and some furnishings (dressers, beds in the master bedroom and=20
guest room) must be replaced
7) To ensure that there are no electrical accidents when the house is=20
inhabited again, it should be completely rewired; the attic, where=20
most of the wiring is located was not inspected.
8) The room used as an office sustained losses that will cause Mr.=20
Ward to be in agony for months. He will grieve over the loss of his=20
two-volume Oxford English Dictionary. Many reference books,=20
autographed books, papers pertaining to the Richard Wright=20
Encyclopedia and the Cambridge History of African American Literature,=20
Ward's manuscripts for Reading Race Reading America, Hollis Watkins:=20
An Oral Autobiography, and To Shatter the Iris of Innocence (poetry)=20
are beyond recovery.
The same is true for some videotapes. The PC and hard drive, 35mm=20
camera, tape recorder, vacuum cleaner, some photographs and the rare=20
Black Box tapes are ruined. Manuscript materials from Tom Dent and=20
Lance Jeffers and Chakula cha Jua were not damaged.
9) Most of Ward's clothing and shoes have to be replaced; the mold=20
damage is severe.
10) Ward is luckier by far than 89% of the residents whose homes=20
suffered wind and water damage.
Tentative conclusion: Yes, Margaret, "A race of men shall rise and=20
take control"
I am far luckier , thank God, than 89% of my fellow New Orleanians. I=20
have been blessed by the prayers of my relatives and friends. My=20
fortunate circumstances strengthen my resolve to return permanently,=20
to restore my house, to help to restore Dillard University and other=20
educational institutions, to join Dave Brinks and others in grassroots=20
efforts to prevent the NEW New Orleans from becoming a "corporate=20
colony" with a minimal non-white population that is controlled by=20
wealthy and extreme neo-conservatives. I must encourage more people to=20
return. The natural disasters that are now elements of a national=20
tragedy persuade me to fight a repetition of the Reconstruction era=20
and the nadir of African American experiences, to speak loudly against=20
a replay of the Great Migration. Commitments must gradually erase the=20
depression and periods of near-insanity that have afflicted me since=20
August=20
29 2005. I must devote myself to the practice of civic virtue in New=20
Orleans.

noulipo is the second annual experimental writing event to be held at
REDCAT, the Roy and Edna Disney CalArts Theater in downtown Los Angeles.
It takes place on the weekend of October 28th and 29th, 2005.
[see www.redcat.org or email noulipo@gmail.com]

noulipo puts new and established writers into dialogue about issues in=20=

contemporary writing and its relations to everyday life. This year our=20=

focus is on the legacy of the French literary group Oulipo, with=20
addresses from the President of the group, Paul Fournel and one of its=20=

youngest members, Ian Monk. Our aim is to discuss currents in=20
contemporary writing that combine strategies developed by members of=20
the Oulipo with other techniques, to move beyond an oppositional idea=20
of form and develop new modes of wordwork that challenge structures of=20=

domination by seriously playing with the wor(l)d.

Oulipo was founded in 1960 and has become renowned for exploring the=20
use of constraint. A constraint is a sort of limiting design principle=20=

that a writer assumes to help in the creation of a text. A lot of=20
Oulipo=92s experiments are influenced by math.  N+7 is a constraint that=20=

substitutes all the nouns in a text with the 7th noun below it in the=20
dictionary. We put the n at the beginning of our title to signify both=20=

new and the idea of math or algebra, as in =93x =3D 2n + 1.=94

Organized by Matias Viegener and Christine Wertheim. Speakers include=20
Caroline Bergvall, Christian B=F6k, Johanna Drucker, Paul Fournel, Tan=20=

Lin, Bernadette Mayer, Ian Monk, Harryette Mullen, Doug Nufer, Vanessa=20=

Place, Janet Sarbanes, Juliana Spahr, Rodrigo Toscano, and Rob Wittig.=20=

During the daytimes there will be 5 discussion panels (3 writers each +=20=

moderator) organized around themes related to the overall aim. A final=20=

summary panel will reflect upon the discussions and suggest directions=20=

for further debate. The panel themes and line-ups are:

letters and numbers: Until the invention of =93free verse,=94 poets had=20=

always used highly systematized devices in the construction of their=20
works. While admiring the sonnet=97even taking the form to its ultimate=20=

limit=97the Oulipo also draw on formal mathematics as a source of =
devices=20
for the creation of literature. Is there a limit to this practice? And=20=

where might the future lead?
      Speakers: Brian Kim Stefans, Christine Wertheim.

the politics of constraint: Normally considered under the category of=20
pure poetics, can constrained writing also address a politics? Can this=20=

include an address to issues of class, race and gender? If constrained=20=

writing eschews the =93fiction=94 of the lyrical subject by shattering =
the=20
author-ity of the creative =93I,=94 just whose power is challenged, =
whose=20
norms transgressed?
      Speakers: Christian B=F6k, Juliana Spahr, Rodrigo Toscano.

words at work and words as play: What are the connections between=20
constraint, so often seen as an interdiction (with all its parental=20
overtones), and the playfulness invoked by the kinds of methods the=20
Oulipo uses? (How) can one play at writing while still writing=20
seriously?
      Speakers: Caroline Bergvall, Harryette Mullen, Rob Wittig

science and chance- aleatorics vs automatization: "Experiment," says=20
Deleuze, "never interpret." What is an =93experiment=94 in writing?  And=20=

what is the difference, in effect, between using scientific=20
methodologies to create literature, and playing with chance, non-sense=20=

and unstable meanings?
      Speakers: Bernadette Mayer, Ian Monk, Matias Viegener.

the contents of constraint: Is there an antithetical relationship=20
between constraint and content, process and form, meaning and matter,=20
surface and depth. Are there advantages to not revealing the=20
constraints of one=92s text to the reader? Whose advantage?
      Speakers: Paul Fournel, Doug Nufer, Vanessa Place.

summary panel
      Speakers: Johanna Drucker, Tan Lin, Janet Sarbanes.

The evenings will be devoted to two public performances at which the=20
speakers will read from their work.
Friday Evening Reading Lineup: Johanna Drucker, Tan Lin, Bernadette=20
Mayer, Douglas Nufer, Vanessa Place, Rodrigo Toscano, Christine=20
Wertheim, Rob Wittig

BELLADONNA*

with

Mairead Byrne
& Stacy Szymaszek

Tuesday, October 11, 7PM
@ Dixon Place (258 Bowery, 2nd Floor—Between Houston & Prince)
Admission is $5 at the Door.

Mairead Byrne immigrated to the United States from Ireland in 1994 for
reasons of poetry. Her collection NELSON & THE HURUBURU BIRD was published
in 2003 by Wild Honey Press. Recent and upcoming publications include two
chapbooks, AN EDUCATED HEART (Palm Press 2005) and VIVAS (Wild Honey Press
2005), and poems in 5 AM, CONDUIT, DENVER QUARTERLY, and VOLT. She is the
author of two plays, two books of interviews with Irish artists, a short
book on James Joyce, and a great deal of journalism in Ireland and the
United States. She earned a PhD in Theory & Cultural Studies from Purdue
University in 2001 and lives with her two daughters in Providence, Rhode
Island, where she teaches poetry at Rhode Island School of Design.

Stacy Szymaszek is the Program Coordinator at the Poetry Project at St.
Mark's Church. Her chapbooks include Some Mariners (EtherDome Press, 2004),
Mutual Aid (gong, 2004), Pasolini Poems (Cy Press, 2005) and There Were
Hostilities (release, 2005). She is a coeditor with Instance Press and
founder and editor of Gam: A Survey of Great Lakes Writing, a project which
will be mutating into something else soon. Her book Emptied of all Ships was
published this year by Litmus Press.

Belladonna* is a feminist/innovative reading and publication series that
promotes the work of women writers who are adventurous, experimental,
politically involved, multi-form, multicultural, multi-gendered,
unpredictable, dangerous with language (to the death machinery). In its five
year history, Belladonna* has featured such writers as Leslie Scalapino,
Alice Notley, Erica Hunt, Fanny Howe, Mei-mei Berssenbrugge, Cecilia Vicuña,
Lisa Jarnot, Camille Roy, Nicole Brossard, Abigail Child, Norma Cole, Lynne
Tillman, Gail Scott and Carla Harryman among many other experimental and
hybrid women writers. Beyond being a platform for women writers, the
curators promote work that is experimental in form, connects with other art
forms, and is socially/politically active in content. Alongside the
readings, Belladonna* supports its artists by publishing commemorative
pamphlets of their work on the night of the event. Please contact us (Erica
Kaufman, Rachel Levitsky et al) at belladonnaseries@yahoo.com to receive a
catalog and be placed on our list.

Dixon Place, a home for performing and literary artists, is dedicated to
supporting the creative process by presenting original works of theater,
dance and literature at various stages of development. An artistic
laboratory with an audience, we serve as a safety net, enabling artists to
present challenging and questioning work that pushes the limits of artistic
expression. With a warm, nurturing atmosphere that encourages and inspires
artists of all stripes and persuasions, we place special emphasis on the
needs of women, people of color, youth, seniors and lesbian/gay artists. The
artist's experience is given top priority through our professional
atmosphere and remuneration, and their process is enhanced through the
reaction of our adventurous audiences. Dixon Place is a local haven for
creativity as well as an international model for the open exploration of the
process of creation. Please visit www.dixonplace.org for more information.

*deadly nightshade, a cardiac and respiratory stimulant, having purplish-red
flowers and black berries

Belladonna* readings happen monthly between September and June.

We are grateful for partial funding by Poets and Writers, CLMP, NYSCA, and
Dixon Place.

Dear Colleague:

I am writing you on behalf of the search committee in Women's Studies at
Duke
University to ask for your help in disseminating information about the
position
currently open in our program.  As you might know, we are seeking a director
for the
undergraduate certificate program in sexuality studies.  The position has
been
articulated as a tenured one, and the research specialty within sexuality
and gender
studies has been defined as the African diaspora. (See the official ad
below.)

Dear Colleague:

I am writing you on behalf of the search committee in Women's Studies at Duke
University to ask for your
help in disseminating information about the position
currently open in our program.  As you might know, we are seeking a
director for the
undergraduate certificate program in sexuality studies.  The position has
been
articulated as a tenured one, and the research specialty within sexuality and
gender
studies has been defined as the African diaspora. (See the official ad below.)

We imagine a diverse pool of candidates, including those who work on the
transnational
study of sexuality and diaspora in various world regions, as well as those
whose
research expertise might fall outside of this framework altogether but who have
proven
administrative experience in the institutional development of both sexuality
studies
and Women's Studies in a transnational perspective. We are also prepared to
consider
advanced Assistant Professors with demonstrable research success in the
configuration

The article (below) from the Sacramento Bee is a fascinating account of the
way in which U.S. Rep. Richard Pombo, R-Tracy, the Chair of
the U.S. House Committee on Resources tried to use Eugene O'Neil's home in
Danville, California (in the context of the locally hot real estate market)
as black mail in order to get Congress to pass Arctic Drilling rights on to
the Oil Companies. A Shell oil refinery is located right near O'Neil home
and who knows how much Shell has donated already to his election campaigns.
If Conceptual Mail Art was still alive we would be sending bent nails to the
Hammer (Delay), and paperback copies of O'Neil to Pombo.

DANVILLE, California - Every year, 3,500 visitors make their way to the
protected hillside home where Eugene O'Neill penned - with torturous effort
- the works that would make him the only American playwright to win the
Nobel Prize.

What if a for-sale sign went up out front of the rambling, two-story Spanish
colonial home?

In the heated Bay Area housing market, the 13-acre site with a to-die-for
view of Mount Diablo and the San Ramon Valley and a literary legend in its
past could fetch millions.

OAS_AD('Button20'); In a curious revelation recently from the halls of
Congress, that very scenario seemed to be in the works: put the Eugene
O'Neill National Historic Site on the auction block along with 14 other
national park sites to help balance the national budget.

The O'Neill home, named Tao House, was the only California site on the list.
Loyal supporters in the valley surrounding the Danville house were stunned.

"The e-mails were buzzing back and forth," said Gary DeAtley, a board member
of the Eugene O'Neill Foundation, Tao House.

Low in profile, the homesite is nonetheless worthy of preservation, he said.
"It's not Jefferson's home, and it's not Yosemite, but it is an important
piece of American history."

How the sale idea got onto paper and how it became public is now little more
than a bizarre story, insisted a spokesman for the U.S. House Committee on
Resources, the original source of the notion.

Chaired by U.S. Rep. Richard Pombo, R-Tracy, whose district includes
Danville, the committee is responsible for the nation's natural resources,
including parks.

Like all Congressional committees, Pombo's was charged with taking inventory
and suggesting ways to pinch pennies - $2.4 billion to be exact, said Matt
Streit, the spokesman.

It's part of an annual ritual to shave national debt and balance the budget,
and the $2.4 billion is Pombo's committee's share, Streit said.

According to him, the undisclosed money-saving schemes submitted to the
Congressional Budget Office are not necessarily reality-based. "There are
crazy ideas that are never going to see the light of day," he said.

True, the committee's staff members compiled a list of 15 national park
sites - those with low attendance - for a suggested giant land sale, Streit
said. After the committee's ideas were submitted to the Congressional Budget
Office, someone there apparently leaked the list, he said.

"This document wasn't meant to be circulated," he said.

In a Sept. 23 letter, the Budget Office apologized to Pombo's committee for
the "inadvertently disclosed" document.

Believe it or not, there are politics involved: Pombo is pushing a
controversial proposal to drill for oil in the Arctic National Wildlife
Refuge, which backers claim would produce $2.5 billion annually for at least
five years. The committee's intent in making up the list was a way of
illustrating the possibilities if the drilling option is rejected, Streit
said.

Eventually, the committee will have to decide how to save the $2.4 billion.

"Selling national parks is not the best one," Streit said. "Obviously, the
American public wouldn't see that as a good idea."

And so it would seem.

The National Parks Conservation Association commissioned a poll taken Sept.
30-Oct. 2 that showed that 79 percent of likely voters strongly disagree or
disagree somewhat with the idea of selling national parks to developers or
the oil and gas industry.

The overwhelming opposition is clear, said Craig Obey, vice president of
governmental affairs for the watchdog group.

The possibility is still on the horizon, he insisted.

"The most important thing is that all people make their voices loud and
clear that this kind of proposal is unacceptable," he said. "Next time,
there could be an even more serious threat."

In an effort to quell the uproar, Pombo's office sent a representative to
the recent O'Neill Festival in Danville, said DeAtley, who is pretty
convinced the threat is gone. At least for now.

"I think there should be a discussion of where money could be saved,"
DeAtley said. "Maybe some parks could be turned over to nonprofits. That was
not the environment that I would start that kind of discussion."

O'Neill is responsible for drawing respect to American theater, where
before, European dramatists reigned, said Jon Rossini, an assistant
professor of theater and dance at University of California, Davis.

He explored controversial topics, such as abortion in a 1914 play, and wrote
serious parts for African Americans.

For artists and fans who see his secluded study behind three closed doors -
the dual desks, the typewriter eschewed for pencils, it's like touching
inspiration, Rossini said.

In his second-floor study, O'Neill would swivel back and forth between works
in progress. Inflicted with a nerve disorder brought on by drinking, he
struggled to put pencil to paper, sometimes using his other hand to steady
the tremors in his writing hand. He refused to use a typewriter.

"There's something to be said about seeing where these plays were created,"
Rossini said. "If we start erasing these spaces, you're erasing the
importance of these playwrights."

O'Neill called the 158-acre homesite his "final home and harbor." In 1937,
with Carlotta, his actress third wife, he moved into the home, which was
infused with Chinese philosophy and art. Carlotta O'Neill's 17 Louis Vuitton
steamer trunks were stored in a specially built trunk house.

Inside, the faintly eccentric bright-blue ceilings represent the sky over
darkly stained pine floors or earth-toned tiles. Here, O'Neill's wife
tenaciously guarded her husband's privacy and creative process.

The couple bought an electric refrigerator that made its own ice, a splurge
in those days; they quite literally did not want the iceman to come.

By 1943, the isolation proved too inconvenient. The home was sold, and the
couple moved back East where O'Neill died in 1953.

He stayed put the longest, though, in the Danville home and ended his
writing career there.

In the ensuing years, homes sprang up at the base of the hill, and now
access to Tao House is limited to shuttles. That could be why so few people
visit.

"I don't know if it's wise to measure a site's worth by the number of
visitors it gets," said Rick Smith, the deputy superintendent for several
East Bay national parks. "We have to preserve it, not just for 10 years, but
for our children's children's children.

forth like a liquor that leaves them dazed as they move toward the slaughter
house.
One might even ask if one would allow the cataclysm to occur without first
giving
free reign to this hubbub of voices...."

Nothing hot runs from my crotch.
One route allowed along Hallowe'en lake
collides within these mumbled densities
cleft like a frustrated quietude...

Hey, while we're still on hiatus from live shows (until we find a
replacement guitarist---which is hard coz bob stinson is dead--), it's still
a busy time in Peasant land.
First, here's some of the latest blog entties
(blog.myspace.com/continuouspeasant)

**Recent thoughts on Christine Hill's Volksboutique
**Help WWOZ locate NOLA MUsicians
**"Micah Ballard and Matt Gonzales--ADOPT A POLITICIAN!
***HAIL KPOO 89.5 FM---the first to play...
***Silver Jews V. Continuous Peasant--not an either/or choice

Also, The first limited edition run of the handmade New Orleans Benefit CD
has sold out (THANKS EVERYBODY FOR SUPPORTING THIS)---though there are still
copies at EARWITNESS records & RockPaperScissors Gallery in Oakland and
Aquarius Records in The Mission) and I'm in the process of making more;

and thanks to KPOO-FM (89.5) for playing the new orleans song! (though the
song has fallen into void at KPFA and KALX; more on that later)

Also, wanted to let you know that the song is up FOR FREE on the Music For
America website (www.musicforamerica.org), along with some things I wrote
about the song and the situation in New Orleans and throughout the USA.

And that I'm involved in an event for NYC based BOOG CITY magazine (poetry
reading and musical guest Julie Napolin; I'll play a solo song or two)
Monday evening Oct 10th,  8PM at ADOBE BOOKS 16th and Mission, and another
poetry event this thursday OCT 13th at SFAI for an International Poetry
Festival (if you want to check out some international poets rather than LIT
QUAKE which unfortunately coincides with it)

Finally, here's a update of some of the latest PEASANTBLOG entries
(BLOG.MYSPACE.COM/continuouspeasant)

      As is happening for many experimental poets, my blog is gradually morphing into a blog/journal. To commemorate this "passing", I've given the blo/jo a new moniker: "P.F.S. Post". And, just like that, I'm sending out a call to post-avantists & other freaky stylin' scribes...send me something! Of course, many of us want to see our best stuff in major journals, web or otherwise....nevertheless, if y'have stuff you fear is too "over the edge", it might find a home at "P.F.S. Post". One limitation I must warn of...my blog likes left hand margin stuff. Haven't figured out how to successfully upload more projective verse....certainly a drag when working with post-avant texts, but what the hell. Other than that, the sky's the limit, maybe even further....so, I'm at afieled@yahoo.com. And, although I know this is a bit gauche (anti-Poetics List etiquette?) you can even call me at 6106082094. Let's make some noise!

It depends if purchase or readership determines publication.  If a book is =
published and no editor, designer, publisher, printer, dropper-inner, =
friend, mother, poetry-book swopper, trader, daughter, neighbor, employer, =
reviewer, i.e., no-one at all reads it, not even the author, I don't know =
if it's published: but I have great faith in libraries and if the lonely =
poet sends the book to libraries, future readers are a possibility.  Money =
and poetry books don't seem to have an excellent relationship. =20
The pressure is always to trade.  To send.  To give away.  To show.  =
Someone should invent a velcro for sticking money to books.  I'm the =
champion purchaser of my own books, I know that much.  I deserve a prize!

(from the site of The Walt Whitman House, Camden, N.J.)

I CELEBRATE myself
And what I assume you shall assume
For every atom belonging to me as good belongs
to you
I loafe and invite my soul
I lean and loafe at my ease....observing a spear
of summer grass.

Leaves of Grass
With these lines, a then unknown Walt Whitman introduced himself to the
literary world of his day. In 1855, at his own expense, he published a book
called Leaves of Grass. Of the 795 copies printed, almost none were sold.

Small Press Traffic is pleased to present
New Experiments: Nada Gordon & Gary Sullivan on the Autré
Friday, October 14, 2005 at 7:30 p.m.


Gordon & Sullivan write:
'The Extremely Hot Twins of Peshawar?'
'Rouge State?'
'Harmoronity?'
What to make of these manifestations, in new writing, of the Outrageous Other,
of globalism gone gaga?
In a multimedia spectacle we will explore autré manifestations as melodrama,
Orientalism, pathos, and mistranslation; as the excessive, exotic,
inappropriate, and naïve. We will conjure these djinns by rubbing the lamps of
poetry, film, music, fashion, and comics. 'This is a genuine imitation of a
previously fabricated wilderness.'"


Nada Gordon is the author of Foriegnn Bodie, Are Not Our Lowing Heifers
Sleeker than Night-Swollen Mushrooms?, Swoon (with Gary Sullivan), and most
recently V. Imp. She lived in Japan for 11 years and teaches English as a
foreign language. With Gary Sullivan she co-edited the Poetry Project
Newsletter. Her blog can be found at http://ululate.blogspot.com.


Gary Sullivan is the author of Dead Man, How to Proceed in the Arts, Swoon
(with Nada Gordon), and most recently, Elsewhere. His ongoing comic strip,
'The New Life,' has been serialized in Rain Taxi since 1997. He has edited
Detour Press, Readme, and co-edited the Poetry Project Newsletter with Nada
Gordon. He maintains a blog at http://garysullivan.blogspot.com.

> Subject: If a book is published & nobody buys it...

The only complaint or cliam or piece of pride left for the author whose book
is without an audience is that "the blind are leading the blind."

I suspect this question is in the same of line of 'the tree falling in the
forest and nobody is there, does it still make a sound?'
Well, trees do fall for books, pulp by pulp into those ink awaiting white
sheets. Maybe we can say, in a pre-digital age, books were, at least, read
by trees. OK, branch out on that one, leaf by leaf!

it's painfully easy to at least  sell 100 copies  of your own po book
over a bit of time  but you must be willing  to do the hustle   tho
embarassing  it pays  off
tho i must admit to rarely buying  other folks'  books
tho many are given to me
and i know many  folks  who just prefer to give them away
or never  buy any  from  their publisher to resell at readings
alot  of musicians  do likewise

it's like promoing a gig  most  don''t and then they complain when no one
shows   up

even a case like the outlaw bible of american poetry
i am probably one of the only folks   who over time  bought about
20 from publisher  at wholesale contributor's price
and then resold them at a small profit
but below  retail price
just last wek sold one to a cute blond from scandinavia
now she and it and 4 other books of mine reside over seas  etc

the concept of publication is screwy these days because of the technology.
Print on demand is fine. Mimeo was salvation. Internet is virtual, so who
cares and should! Everyone, event the giant (REAL) publishers use print on
demand so they don't have to wharehouse 1000 books, ten thousand books and
pay tax on monster inventories and wharehousing expenses. It is just the
shield of credibility that they, THE REAL BIG PUBLISHERS have that gives
their use of print on demand a different flavor, CACHE. If a book never
sells and is only handed out to friends that should be enough. IT'S REAL
ENOUGH. It's great to get a book "published", I'd like to have one this very
minute. Yippee! Even to get a book photocopied is a treat. It costs money.
Does that make it more valid?  There aren't many copies of the Gutenberg
Bible and Gutenberg is dead, what happened to his copy? It's all so
precious, and the great libraries and literary reputations of the world are
burned to the ground, under ten feet of Misssissippi river mud, under a
Honduran slide, or where California used to be. One day you might wake up
and wonder where you left yourself. Why write at all?! I say take what you
can and give no less credibility to what you have...

in my neck of the woods, academia, publication is the point, not
readership.  if your book is published, it counts as a "publication"
-no attention is paid to sales figures.

(from the site of The Walt Whitman House, Camden, N.J.)

I CELEBRATE myself
And what I assume you shall assume
For every atom belonging to me as good belongs
to you
I loafe and invite my soul
I lean and loafe at my ease....observing a spear

Leaves of Grass
With these lines, a then unknown Walt Whitman introduced himself to the
literary world of his day. In 1855, at his own expense, he published a book
called Leaves of Grass. Of the 795 copies printed, almost none were sold.

maria, agree with you to some degree, they do love that spine in
academia, just want to caress it, fondle, don't matter who made the
spine as long as it's a spine, an artifact that stands up tall
without (much) support in the department displaycase....  *but*,
prestige of press is a bugbear, bears down especially on
underemployed academics and/or teachers in the lower tiers, and
that's creative or scholarly pubs....  my dean (here in a 3rd-tier
institution) actually made ranked various academic presses on a power
point presentation and showed them to the entire (ie, x-disciplinary)
junior faculty.  in some ways the honesty was refreshing, but still,
the shoe-quaking was felt far and wide.  meanwhile, a gal i know (not
*me*, of course...) looked at a job announcement for a 2nd-tier
institution last week that said "minimum one book," but when she (not
me!) discussed her (not mine!) vita with someone on the faculty
there, she (moi?) was told, "minimum one *trade* book, actually...."
wheeeeeeeeeee.  kass

yes, i totally agree, prestige of press presses heavily --but in

can buy them, but the press's P-factor is huge...

use books like baseball cards only libraries should have keeping potential =
don't be greedy "property is theft" and all that buy a book for the sake of=
 the publishers but trade them often with people that's how you build reade=
rship AKA did you read...?

self publishing too cut out the middle person it's a one human show like pa=
int yr own damn picture who leaves it up to editors is sadly mistaken thoug=
h i am an editor BUT the way sarah and i do things is this we get some kick=
 ass texts and BUILD A BOOK AROUND THE TEXT no cutting tampering except for=
 "we don't like it sorry send it to Greg or David"

what's the use of books treat them like baseball cards trade 'em mark off t=
he checklist and get together and talk about it a symposium or two OK but d=
amn folks share and share alike no fighting no Indigenous Peoples giving

er, that's why they're, er um, er, called TRADE um Paperbacks!!!!!

Are we saying national publication in print is only of limited cultural
value; for academic evidence, for personal recognition, for cudos?

There is still a lot of print activity at the local level, poets selling
their publications are booksellers and duistributors too.

Perhaps google and yahoo are trying to re-define the way we access books =
ie
private libraries of digital texts where you pay for download? Will they
just exploit existing archives or will they start to find ways to =
promote
newly 'published' texts? Will they begin to create celebrity of new =
writers
to 'sell' their digital texts?



Or Print-on-demand publishers with large digital storage and shopfront
production facilities. Will they just be repositories for
out-of-print(paper) books? Will they start to actively promote new =
writers
of new texts?

Is it now up to writers to be their own promotions and public relations
officers as well as publisher, distributor and book-seller, establishing
websites to promote their works that they offer for on-line download or =
in
shipped pod-paper format?

Ok, with lots -- and lots! -- of love:

Flash Vignette

Knew a man who’d grope his
wife from behind a large white sheet
“made antiseptic.” And who’d press
tranny hookers into being force-fed
¼-carat diamonds wrapped in feces.
And whose semen, I was told, somehow’d
congeal like aspic. “Mere alcohol
doesn’t thrill me at all,” he liked
to boast, quoting from Cole Porter
song heard x-times by way of Sinatra.
"When she was young, she was a beautiful woman--"
And as she got older, eyeliner
made her eyes look deep-set and
skin no longer taught,  relaxed itself
along the bones of her face.

Richard Jeffrey Newman has two upcoming readings, each from his translation
of Saadi's Gulistan, a work that people on this list might find interesting
because it is a mixed genre (prose and poetry) text.

Tuesday, November 1, 7  PM

WHY PERSIAN LITERATURE? WHY NOW? SAADI'S 13TH CENTURY ROSE GARDEN IN TODAY'S
WORLD

Saadi of Shiraz, a contemporary of Rumi, is one of the masters of classical
Persian literature. His masterpiece, the Gulistan (Rose Garden), is revered
worldwide both for the literary pleasure it provides and for the wisdom it
contains. In the 1600s, Andre du Ryer's translation of the Gulistan into
French gave the West one of its first sympathetic windows into the world of
Islam. Subsequent translations into Dutch, Latin, German, Russian and
English spread Saadi's name and the humanistic values that are so central to
his work throughout the literary and cultural landscapes of the 18th and
19th centuries, influencing writers like Goethe, Byron, Emerson and Thoreau.
Emerson thought so highly of the Gulistan that he called it "a secular
bible." In the 20th century, a passage from the Gulistan was inscribed in
the lobby of the United Nations. Now, in the 21st century, with Iran
occupying an ever more significant place on the world stage, it is important
that we revisit that country's history and culture, reminding ourselves of
the treasures it has given the world and looking to see what we can learn
from those treasures not only about Iran and its people, but also about
ourselves.

Richard Jeffrey Newman is an essayist, poet and translator who has been
publishing his work since 1988, when the essay "His Sexuality; Her
Reproductive Rights" appeared in Changing Men magazine. Since then, his
essays and poems have appeared in Salon.com, The American Voice, The
Pedestal, Circumference, Prairie Schooner, ACM, Birmingham Poetry Reviewand
other literary journals. He has given talks and led workshops on writing
autobiographically about gender, sex and sexuality. Selections from Saadi's
Gulistan, his first book, was published in 2004 by Global Scholarly
Publications (GSP). He will be translating four more books for GSP: Saadi's
other masterpiece, the Bustan, Ferdowsi's Shahnameh, Nezami's Haft Peykar
and Attar's Elahi Nameh. His own book of poems, The Silence Of Men, is
forthcoming from CavanKerry Press. You can learn more about his work at
www.richardjnewman.com. He is an Associate Professor in the English
Department at Nassau Community College.

this  fking  academic  shit

we'd  all like to be published  by a good publisher


but  what an insult to the work

when m d  states things like

in academia  all that's  important
is to get published
and  without  doubt   the better the publisher the better the credentials
 seem

but it's  bad enough we  get published
by lots of little jerks  and then the books  get lost in the ether
but to try  not  to  get the work seen
at least by a hand full of peers  well that's
just  a new kind of vain stupidity
sell it  keepne in yer pocket
let  a few pitiful poets  at least know
you've got a book
or as stated  earlier if yer benevolent enough
or stupid enough
just give the damned thing away
give it to any one
that homeless guy  on the corner   or
the book seller  who will eventually  turn a profit
on yer sad little life
but  do something with it
oh hallowed   hollowed  halls
do we all just write for ourselves  for the old  onanists  we are
harper  row  here i come  or was that harper's ferry

Of course it is still published as long as the copies of it exist and it's not a books-on-demand book.  The book will be distributed either by the publisher or by you.  Eventually some copies will sell.  If you have to give some away in order to make this happen, why not?  Genuine generosity pays off karmically, too.

When I published my first book in 1967, the publisher got real spicy at not=
 having any sales. My mother, God bless her soul, bought all 500,000 copies=
. Her estate is now worth 79.6 million millions of dollars.

She still has three copies left. I'm auctioning them for 1 million million =
dollars starting bid.

Any takes?

>>KAT RPT: armies of compassion awol
==================================

Dear national arts communities and New Orlenians in exile,

Three weeks ago I managed to escape the chaos of New Orleans on a
pirated/stolen school bus in a scenario that can only be describe as a
Hollywod South version of "Hotel Rwanda." I can only write to explore
the madness that we are still bearing witness to today in the political
aftermath of Katrina. It is my duty as an artist, activist, writer and
cultural critic to present my analysis of an endemic disease in this
society that was exemplified in the inaction of federal support after
the natural storm of
Katrina. Below is the latest piece that I have written. Know that I do
not take things lightly and I am deeply disturbed about the direction
of this Union. No, correction, I am outraged! I offer these words to
you my cyberspace arts communities.

I believe it is a crucial time for action and my pen has always been my
best sword against any injustices I have experienced in this country.
Know that as a Latino immigrant, I have always wanted to believe in
the "American Dream" mythology. It has been at the thematic center of
all my work in the arts, and when I offer such critique of the system,
it is because I care deeply about this "multiracial experiment" called
the United States. Ashe, gracias. ---JTT www.torrestama.com

Â 
The "Armies of Compassion" were AWOL in New Orleans after Katrina
I keep hearing about these "armies of compassion," and while I was
sequestered by the chaos of New Orleans in Katrinaâ€™s aftermath--
trapped in a perverse social experiment that seemed to be engineered by
homeland security sadists--these armies were absent without leave.
AWOL! Where were they while my beloved bayou city descended into an
even greater terror than the physical damage that Hurricane Katrina
spawned
with her category five fury of water and wind? Their absence
exemplified the criminal incompetence of local, state and national FEMA
officials--who actually heightened the social upheaval by preventing
private citizens and organizations from delivering urgent aid without
their "official" bureaucratic "rescue" stamp.

These prevention strategies still continue even now, more than two
weeks after the natural storm, because FEMA can only seem to flex its
ineffectual muscles, which are trained in military practices, and have
transformed a natural disaster into a state of war. Letsâ€™ not forget
that this is a "northern" confederacy of dunces who only know "war" and
breed a "culture of war!" It should come as no surprise that FEMA has
employed a strategy of uniformed military siege on the city of New
Orleans, and the social chaos that was unleashed in their inaction gave
them the best
excuse to take the "perfect storm" and turn it into a war at home. And
be informed that the practices being implemented on evacuees are
turning them into "prisoners" of FEMA, and their "armies of compassion"
when visible seem to lack the sensitivity training to exact a more
humane effort in support of those who are left with nothing. These are
your tax dollars at work.

While we have been privy to TV staged efforts of FEMAâ€™s aid and the
photo opportunities of Bush hugging evacuated African American
children, many current accounts demonstrate that the "armies of
compassion" seem astute in the act of disappearance after the cameras
are gone or are rarely to be found on the fields of the disaster. Such
was the case on the third day after Katrina had passed and the social
storm in New Orleans was increasing in strength. It became more evident
to me that the "armies of compassion,"
still "missing in action," were part of a political strategy to punish
this Southern port city because it recently voted itself the
color "blue" in a "red" state?

It was not a stretch of the imagination to envision this Christian
maniacal executive chief whipping New Orleans into submission like so
many African slaves were whipped by similar bible-toting masters only a
century and half ago? Letâ€™s not forget that previous "armies of
compassion" have been used to protect slave-holding patrons and hold
hostage their booty of dark-skinned property in a disturbing history
that is not too far removed from this post-modern disaster.

In a city of ghosts like New Orleans, the past is always present, and I
do not suffer from the cultural amnesia that often prevails in this
channel-surfing consumer society. I know too well that this nation has
an extensive resume of denying its
citizenry of color due justice and protection under a set of laws--
which have been historically applied with a biased gavel. From one
century to another, I have seen little difference and only forty years
ago similar "armies of compassion" were denying African Americans the
right to assemble in the South and trying to suffocate the civil rights
movement as much as they were denying proper voting rights and humane
working conditions to Mexican American farm workers in California and
engaged in acts of predicated murder to stop the American Indian
movement. Welcome to a brief history of abuse of power in America.

I see a similar indifference in Katrinaâ€™s wake and the inaction by
FEMA and the current heads of state is just as sinister and calculated
as other previous atrocities committed against people of color. Where
do I begin and how do I continue? Well, here are a few more
examples just for the sake of practical argument: the "trail of tears"
against native Americans, the Zoot Zoot riots against Mexicans in Los
Angeles, the internment of Japanese Americans during World War II, the
planned acts of arson against the Latino community in the Hoboken, New
Jersey fires of the 1980â€™s that displaced thousands for real-estate
development condos overlooking the New York skyline? Oh, give me a
decade in this history, and I can point to an atrocity for your
palette. If we are to have any justice for the future of this
multiracial experiment called the United States, then heads should be
rolling in the same bloodbath that these neo-cons have created in the
remaining floodwaters of New Orleans.

And letsâ€™ hear it for the Bush matriarch who aptly deserves
the "Marie Antoinette Award" for calling the displaced evacuees at the
Houston shelter as being better off
because "you know, (they) were underprivileged anyway, so this is
working very well for them." What clearer evidence that this Bush
family is completely without the faintest of clues when face to face
with the poor--the other face of America that they have been shielded
from in their veil of supreme wealth that is stained with more and more
blood on the surface of the oil that feeds them. I imagine that this is
her "compassionate conservatism" on display in polemic black and white?

And what about the "chosen" TV images that sculpted such a believable
profile of a culture in electric short handâ€”images that criminalized
African Americans even further than the norm? Even without Katrina, we
are generally aware of the accepted norms that one is always suspect in
this country just by being black and/or Latino, native and Middle
Eastern. Repeatedly, we were treated to images that
created even greater fear of African Americans in a city with a rich
legacy of civil rights defenders and a black intelligentsia, premiere
Jazz musicians and composers, writers and artists, cultural workers and
educators. But the media trance fixed its hypnotic loops over and over
on images in which black people were either wanton looters or poor
victims. Yes, there was certainly some truths in images of both and
plenty of the cityâ€™s poorest were sequestered and abandoned in public
shelters that never offered the public assistance promised by local and
state officials. But where were Bushâ€™s "armies of compassion" then?

What we certainly did not see on TV were the valiant efforts of African
Americans like the middle-aged woman I met at the edge of Esplanade
Avenue, in the residential end of the Quarter, trying desperately to
secure safe passage out of the chaos for her
eighty-year old mother. In my short exchange with her, she mentioned
how she was being immediately sized-up as a "potential looter" herself,
and it was difficult to get assistance and even check into a Hotel for
some safety. No, you did not see this face of a concerned daughter
trying to do the right thing, and the invisible "armies of compassion"
were not there to usher her and her mother to safety.

Never was any of this looting footage prefaced by a proclamation that
what makes New Orleans attractive to the country and to world over is
owed mostly to its people of colorâ€”its African heritage that has
built this city with the spilling of its enslaved blood and that even
under such abhorrent conditions, these historically oppressed people
transformed their pain into art and music and a culture that is revered
internationally. Of course not, how can we expect such historical
tribute and debt to be paid to people of color on prime time TV and
cable stations that are generally the most effective tools for the
propagation of white supremacy? Yes, I said it!

I can only imagine how it scares you when the legacy of "white
supremacy" is brought to the forefront in the analysis of such an
atrocity. Well, letâ€™s not forget that it is the most evident of the
difficult civil secrets that lies just "under the skin" in this divided
society, and there were no "armies of compassion" that countered this
belief in the aid of the poor and abandoned.

This city that knows its respect for the ancients, this grand Madame of
the South deserved an organized effort of heart and efficiency of
humanity and true compassion. I remain deeply disturbed, perplexed and
outraged as to how this great empire of capital and industry could not
manage to organize its technology to
mount a proper rescue for the most "precious pueblo" in its possession.
By what method of madness and political design did the "armies of
compassion" arrive a working week late when the city was already
festering like an untreated wound in the August heat and people were
dying in the plain view of national TV coverage and angered news
reporters? Only, now, can I say thatâ€”finally--in the face of such
tragedy it looks like the press in this country has regained its
backboneâ€”its cojones--its courage to put a camera on the brutal
truths of a continuing legacy of abandonment!

What do I offer as a modest proposal of retribution or solution to
these crimes? I call for more than FEMAâ€™s Brown and his "calculated"
resignation and put the "blood of these people" on boy Georgeâ€™s hands
and the arrogance of his family privilege. This is not a time for us to
be cowards and hold our
flaccid tongues in silence for fear of sounding unpatriotic, because if
we have any freedoms left in this Union and we are to deserve them as a
free nation, then, we need to exercise these "inalienable rights" today
and hold accountable a government that has played us with its
recklessness and cruel indifference to working people and the poor.

This is a rogue administration whose pomposity is killing more of its
citizenry, and if we remain with our tongues in our hands, then we
deserve the fascist posturing it continues to flaunt while disguising
itself as a "compassionate conservative" regime that calls for a "day
of prayer" in the wake of its murderous bureaucracy. I will exhibit the
same lack of FEMA compassion that dragged across the flooded streets of
New Orleans and managed to turn my city into Baghdad in four days while
it has taken three years to take that sovereign nation
and turn into another "red mess" before the eyes of the world. If only
the armies of compassion could have been that efficient.

One rule I developed is a Good Publisher is someone who publishes books by
people you wouldn't be ashamed to be associated with.

Matters fuck all how many books eventually get published, what matters is
who you don't feel ashamed to be published in the same stable as.

I'm a former academic who went into technology some time ago and recently
decided to leverage my experience in tech by opening a new, noncommercial
poetry venue online called Poetry Circle.

http://www.poetrycircle.com

I'd be honored if you joined, contributed some work, and even offered to
help edit work if you have time or inclination. The bent is toward
contemporary and experimental work.

The site is brand new, but I have quite a bit of experience now in creating
such sites, having created and marketed

http://www.photocamel.com

and other communities, so you can be sure I'll try to make this one worth
your while. I'll be adding features as I find the time.

Anyway, I hope you'll stop by and also spread the word among your colleagues
and students. I'd be happy to create special boards on the site for group or
classroom work.

Folks,

Russian poet Sergey Gandlevsky, along with his translator,
Philip Metres, will be concluding their tour of the U.S. with
two readings on the West Coast.  Gandlevsky was named in a
critics' poll as Russia's most important contemporary poet.

Friday, October 14th, USC, 2pm
Monday, October 17th, Stanford University, 5:15 pm

If you can believe, I still don't know which rooms these will
be held in, but both events are sponsored by the Slavic
Departments, though the USC reading likely is co-sponsored by
the English department through Marjorie Perloff.  If you're
interested, just contact the Slavic departments).

Wow, I had a poetry teacher once who required us to buy her book from her a=
t
five bucks *higher* than the retail price. Now thats chutzpah.

I'm all for hawking your books at readings though-- muscians do it this way=

so why not poets?

We're pleased to announce the availability of two new chapbooks from
Katalanche Press:

 Self Charm: Selected Sonnets & Other Poems
Samuel Greenberg
Edited by Michael Carr & Michael Smith

$5
36 pages, staple bound

About the author:

Samuel Greenberg died of tuberculosis in 1917 at 23 years old. The
contents of this selection date from around 1915 and 1916, during which
he worked on his most concerted poetic effort, the Sonnets of Apology.
Greenberg was an eccentric poet enraptured by language. His works only
began to be noticed well after his death and, while still largely
unknown, they are claimed to anticipate surrealism as well as having
gained the admiration of Hart Crane & John Ashbery. The texts in this
volume, some of which have never appeared in print before, have been
edited to retain the many idiosyncrasies of Greenberg's original
manuscripts.


Essence

The opera singer softly sang
Like the pellucid birds of Australian
thicket, Anatomy's lace wrung
The cells of thousand feelings
And tastes, centigrades power
Told climates revelations
The Psycologist felt the Heart
The poets instinct slumber apart
through the parks, the Forest
Filled the air of insense pure
The paintor bent his brush
through sensations quest
Time weeps in patence duration
through scepters creat imotional risist

From Claire Obscure:

Pill love. Twenty-four hour love feel love dissolve communions. Type O
stream. Feel. Again. A gain. Anon abandoned love a pulse a non factor.
There are anon numbers are contrivances. The letter means and means
nothing.

Make it consumptive means make me make with a feel, make me, feel anon,
make me feel a non loved sequitur. Quit logic failed. Quiet the numbers.
One round white flat pill, inscribed. Pro and prescription. A fill.

All there is here, body. No know God no reference. Love biochemical.
Vital. Viral. To catch, as in a meaning of. Quiet the letters.

So, I detect a general unrest when it comes to printing &
distributing books via POD services. But maybe it only has to do with
using a service such as that to distribute self-published works.  For
instance, if my press chooses to have a pod print a run of 100 copies
but sell & distribute thru my regular channels, the POD really is
only a cost effect printer & nothing more.

&  how do people feel about reprints?  I've been handprinting &
handbinding Xexoxial books since 1977 & I no longer have the time to
do all that printing & binding myself.  (and interns are few & far
between...) It's a mighty attractive option to be able to keep XE in
stock by using a service such as lulu.com

Ben - I like this whole new series of images of fresh and singular
manuscript pages. They have a stark and original immediacy and need about
them which - on one hand - is as familiar as running out of laundry
detergent the night before work and urgently needing a fresh, home ironed
shirt - or, on other hand, as ordinary as a reminder to buy milk and toilet
paper. These are qualities often lost, no matter theoretical precision, in
the making of poetry of a metaphysical variety. I, for one, appreciate the
loving reminder. Indeed. you have turned Manhattan upside down and shaken
out its pockets and rendered one of its major ontological features. A 'love
poem' indeed.

I am sure many will welcome your attention to these manuscript pages and
desire to reproduce them in your "publish or self-perish editions."

It reminds me of what H.H. Bancroft said 150 years - as he collected mss.
Pages and documents for his burgeoning new library:

 " Printed books are social, but there is something like sacred reserve in a
manuscript, particularly if there be no copy of it. ... Among the printed
books in a library there are many faces familiar on other shelves, but
manuscripts have their distinct personality. A printed book has its alter
ego in a hundred or a thousand different places at one time; a manuscript is
like a man, one and indivisible."
(see his Bancroft's Works, vol 38, pg 666) ...

Hello friends, A reminder to come out and see Nada Gordon and Gary Sullivan
tomorrow night on the Autre! In our New Experiments series. 7:30 tomorrow,
Oct. 14.

Also, Sarah Gambito can't make it so Melissa Benham has kindly agreed to read
with Stephanie Young next Friday, Oct. 21. Details below.

Small Press Traffic is pleased to present
Melissa R. Benham & Stephanie Young
Friday, October 21, 2005 at 7:30 p.m.

Melissa R. Benham is the author of codeswitching (Subday Press, 2003), as well
as the chapbooks repronounceable, surrealist object vs. narrated dream, and
recounted.  Currently, she curates the Artifact Reading Series, with Chana
Morgenstern, and is the publisher/editor for Artifact Press.  Her work has
appeared in 3rd Bed, el pobre Mouse, How2, Fourteen Hills, Shampoo Poetry, and
others. Of codeswitching, Bhanu Kapil writes, "The divinatory act, in Melissa
Benham's work, is a movement, as I track it, into the 'dangerous visible'.
These are poems written at a location that is constantly disappearing, or
burning up."

Stephanie Young is the editor of Bay Poetics, forthcoming from Faux Press, and
author of Telling the Future Off, just out from Tougher Disguises Press. She
can be found online at http://stephanieyoung.durationpress.com and in person
in Oakland, where she hosted house readings from 2003-05. K. Silem Mohammad
says of her debut, "in the world reflected by these poems, socio-textual trust
is absolutely essential, under the shadow of mercenary workplace ethics as
well as the ever-compromised politics of the private."

This is an occasional notice about the list of websites I keep for =
Portland State University's English Department. It's mainly for students =
and faculty, but people around the Net are using it too.

If you have a site you'd like listed, and it's not commercial, please =
let me know.
Also, if you think any on-line literary journal should be listed, please =
let me know, and I'll look at it.
I'm also considering listing blogs, if they are relevant to the mission =
of the list.

Sean Finney's book release party and poetry reading for The Obedient
Door will be at Valencia Street Books
569 Valencia between 16th and 17th
Thursday, October 13
7:30

The very next night, Friday, October 14, I read at Litquake,
7 p.m. at the Noe Valley Ministry with former US Laureate Robert Hass
and other luminaries.

You can order The Obedient Door from

The Obedient Door has received the following review from John Ashbery:

Sean Finney's cheerfully slipshod poems recycle urban moments that
don't quite add up to a time, moods that may be part of a
relationship, or not, unclassifiable afternoon afterthoughts and
changes in temperature: "which song bring's stone's rise and water's
fall / into the bending of wrists and ankles / and broken corners for
dust to change light."  These are lines from his poem "What the
Leopards Reject."  We would be wise to reject the leopards' whims and
feast on the scraps he has so eloquently assembled for us, which are
in fact those of life itself.

"Our intention is to disrupt the empire, to incapacitate it, to put
pressure on the cracks, to make it hard to carry out its bloody
functioning against the people of the world, to join the world struggle,
to attack from the inside. Our intention is to engage the enemy, to wear
away at him, to isolate him, to expose every weakness, to pounce, to
reveal his vulnerability. Our intention is to encourage the people, to
provoke leaps in confidence and consciousness, to stir the imagination,
to popularize power, to agitate, to organize, to join in every possible
way the people's day to day struggles." -- w.u. prairie fire

MFA WRITING PROGRAM DIRECTOR

The MFA Writing Program at the California Institute of the Arts seeks
a Director. Now twelve years old and at a stable enrollment of
approximately forty-five students, the program is known for its
unconventional (non-tracking) curriculum that encourages writing
across genres and media and a creative practice informed by critical
perspectives. It is housed in the School of Critical Studies, which is
responsible for the liberal arts education of CalArts undergraduates
pursuing BFAs in Film, Dance, Music, Art and Theater. Core MFA faculty
also teach undergraduate Critical Studies classes and MFA writing
students serve as teaching assistants to the Critical Studies faculty
at large. CalArts is a private, accredited visual  and performing arts
college located in Valencia, California, serving a community of
approximately 1,300 undergraduate and graduate students and is
committed to fostering a diverse artistic/educational environment.

The ideal candidate will have leadership skills, strong teaching and
publication record and a wide range of contacts in a number of
contemporary writing fields. Her or his vision should capitalize upon
the experimental, interdisciplinary nature of the program and its
history of cooperation with other schools within the Institute. In
addition to overseeing the daily operation of the program --
supervising admissions, teaching assistantships, financial aid,
curriculum and hiring decisions -- the Director will teach and act as
a public spokesperson for the program. At this juncture, the program
also seeks strong advocacy and active fundraising for  student
scholarships, faculty development, and other resources.

Send a letter of interest, CV, names of three referees and a short
writing sample (maximum 20 pages) to Dean, School of Critical Studies,
Attn: MFA Writing Director Search, 24700 McBean Parkway, Valencia, CA
91355. Application deadline is November 24, 2005. EOE.

Murat,
Thank you very much for your greetings. And a Happy New Year to you too! A
sweet one.

And also thanks for you kind thoughts on the Whalen work I have been doing.
Philip gave us great gifts and it is a selfish pleasure to return my
appreciation to him for his generous creativity and friendship. Somehow I
figure this is something to do of value. David Meltzer calls it witnessing.
So here we are, as in your anthology, witnessing. That you read the Whalen
work and and value it is a big reward for me. Thanks.

Best to you,
Michael

Michael,

I love your take on what writing poetry and publication and reading each
others' work involve.

I just read the wonderful, stunning poems of Philip Whalen in The New
Review.
You must be thanked over and over again for your labor of love in
propagating
his work.

Happy new year.

Murat

I think POD will become a common practice in the future. When book
distributors charge small and micro presses for storage, many presses
can't break even on sales. I haven't gone POD because I don't know enough
about it, but I stopped dealing with Ingram because they began charging for
storage and my profit margin was so low that the minute I put stamps on the
envelope for a book sold at the mandatory 55% distributor's discount, I lost
money on the sale. If I paid the extra $1000 a year for storage, I wouldn't
have the disposable income to self-publish the books that other publishers
didn't want to risk money on.

POD also solves the storage issue; I've run out of room to put new cartons
Of books until I can unload some of the unsold copies. (Would anybody like
a novel or a short story collection? Let me know.)


Moreover, small publishers seem to be moving to POD as an affordable means
of publishing adventurous literary work. Jukka-Pekka Kervinen has published
some very interesting and exciting poetry through POD at lulu.com and
William Allegrezza has begun his own POD press there, as well. I'm very
pleased with the way Xpress(ed) produced my POD book Avenue Noir last year.

I think reprints are essential. As our lives change, we have to make
adjustments. Sometimes we just don't have the time and energy to do the
things we did when we were younger. I've felt the decline in my own energy
over the years. One of these years I'm not going to be young enough to push
out new books and promote them effectively. Many other writers are in the
same position.

I like to think that what most of us on this List do has literary value.
That value could extend beyond our lifetimes if people commit to reprinting
existing work and reviving out of print work. I'd love to have somebody take
over my publishing efforts and release facsimile editions of my work, via
POD or any other route that might bring more success than my own efforts
have brought.

As I said, at this point I don't know enough about POD to try it myself,
but it looks like an avenue that a lot of us are going to pursue as standard
publishing and distribution become more difficult to obtain.

So, I detect a general unrest when it comes to printing &
distributing books via POD services. But maybe it only has to do with
using a service such as that to distribute self-published works.  For
instance, if my press chooses to have a pod print a run of 100 copies
but sell & distribute thru my regular channels, the POD really is
only a cost effect printer & nothing more.

&  how do people feel about reprints?  I've been handprinting &
handbinding Xexoxial books since 1977 & I no longer have the time to
do all that printing & binding myself.  (and interns are few & far
between...) It's a mighty attractive option to be able to keep XE in
stock by using a service such as lulu.com

Comparative Literature Deparment at City Univeristy's
Graduate Center. This academic conference focuses on poetry
written since 1984, with an emphasis on translation and
border-crossing. Participants in two days of academic
panels include practicing poets along with graduate
students and faculty from the CUNY schools and from
universities as close as Yale and Columbia and as far as
the Sorbonne and Hong Kong.

Thursday night's Opening Roundtable will be moderated by
Steve Evans (University of Maine) with panelists John
Palattella (The Nation), Elizabeth Willis (Wesleyan
University), and Mark McMorris (Georgetown University),
followed by an opening-night reading by CUNY Graduate
Center faculty members Ammiel Alcalay, Marilyn Hacker, and
Wayne Koestenbaum.

The conference will be resplendent with readings of all
kinds, including: a multi-media presentation by Stephanie
Strickland in the Graduate Center's Segal Theater; a
translation session on Friday afternoon; Lunch Readings on
Friday and Saturday with Kate Colby, Brenda Coultas,
Jennifer Hayashida, Kristin Prevallet and Edwin Torres; the
keynote reading with Robert Kelly, Jennifer Moxley, and

The Prison Cell

by Mahmoud Darwish

Translated from Arabic by Ben Bennani



It is possible

It is possible at least sometimes…

It is possible especially now

To ride a horse

Inside a prison cell

And run away……



It is possible for prison walls,

To disappear,

For the cell to become a distant land

Without frontiers:



-What did you do with the walls?

-I gave them back to the rocks.

-And what did you do with the ceiling?

-I turned it into a saddle.

-And your chain?

-I turned it into a pencil.



The prison guard got angry.

He put an end to the dialogue.

He said he didn’t care for poetry,

And bolted the door of my cell.



He came back to see me

In the morning;

He shouted at me:



-Where did all this water come from?

-I brought it from the Nile.

-And the trees?

-From the orchards of Damascus.

-And the music?

-From my heartbeat.



The prison guard got mad:

He put an end to my dialogue.

He said he didn’t like my poetry,

And bolted the door to my cell.



But he returned in the evening:



-Where did this moon come from?

-From the nights of Baghdad.

-And the wine?

-From the vineyards of Algiers.

-And this freedom?

-From the chain you tied me with last night.



The prison guard grew so sad….

He begged me to give him back

His freedom.



Mahmoud Darwish is a Lannan Prize winning poet who was born in the Northern Palestinian village of Birwa- which was later razed by the Israelis in 1948. Exiled from both Israel and Lebanon, Darwish lived in Paris for many years, editing the literary magazine, Al Karmel. For years, as well, Darwish was denied a visa to enter the United States by U.S. state department officials who deemed the poet a "threat".  Though active politically in the Palestinian people's struggle for self- determination, it is documented that Mahmoud Darwish has never even lifted a gun in that struggle, instead using his pen. He now lives in Jordan. A prolific editor and essayist, and recognized as one of the greatest living poets writing in Arabic, his name has never been mentioned as a possibility for the Nobel Prize in Literature, unlike the Syrian poet Adonis, whose career and work, Darwish rivals.  This poem, "The Prison Cell", was published in Naomi Shihab Nye's brilliant anthology, This Same Sky
 (Alladin Paperbacks, 1992).

Linear Arrangements, more Effects from our
Primorial Constraints

by Lanny Quarles

http://xexoxial.org/xerolage/x36.html

I absolutely love these works, which for me fall between my two=20
favorite "concrete" poets, John Furnival and Dom Sylvester Houedard=20
=97both of whom also worked with fundamental lettering. But Quarles' =
code=20
strikes deeper, since it is an effected one; it carries the same=20
archaeology as cuneiform=97strokes, layers, countries, languages,=20
intermingled, interspersed. These pieces could be tablets whose coding=20=

speaks, however troubled, to countries beyond us. I think of our=20
languaging (in relation to Xerolage 36) as imminent, momentary; I think=20=

of these works as simultaneously bound to a particular instance of=20
coding (ascii, Internet), and smeared or parcelled among other frames,=20=

cultures, organisms. I've always admired the baroque, even mannerist,=20
quality of Quarles' style, which comes to fruition here on the printed=20=

page.

=97Alan Sondheim

This looks really interesting, would be even more interesting in print=20=

I'm sure. Printed or etched on silicon. Like a billboard up close its=20
breaking down imagery into fundamental units of on of, squinty pixels.=20=

And I remember the pictures he is talking about at fairs and where not,=20=

where they would "print" your pictures on a dot matrix printer. The=20
influence of his work as a photolithographer shows as well.

=97Derek White

"I think this early exposure to the mutability, and imagistic=20
capability of language has subconsciously effected my entire life, and=20=

my relation to language as a visual component. I have thought about=20
many possible threads of meaning for these pieces, but ended up=20
slightly dissatisfied with their various limitations. One thing I will=20=

ADDITIONAL PROGRAMS OF SHORT FILM

Sat OCT. 22 Anthology Film Archives (5:30 pm)
Love & Music/ LIVE MUSIC short films by J. Reeves
Growing up as a kid with a trumpeter father (Jim Reeves), in a house
full of jazz, I first began putting music and images together in
daydreams. This love of music transferred directly into my filmmaking
practice. Many of my films have been inspired by music and my work
often creates its primary emotional resonances in the collision
between image and sound rhythms. Lately I've been collaborating more
directly with musicians on my soundtracks and in live performances,
which lets me pretend I'm part of the band. This program features a
variety of film shorts that feature music I love, including: The
Girl's nervy, Darling International co-directed with M.M. Serra, He
Walked Away double projection with LIVE MUSIC by Anthony Burr & Erik
Hoversten, and more. *Director in attendance

Sun OCT. 23 Anthology Film Archives (5:30 pm)
Early Film & Video from 1988 to 2001 by J. Reeves
This program of shorts shows the full range of my work from
1988-2005, from hand-painted films, political statements, to queer
erotica and personal narrative. Chronic, a kind of precursor to my
feature The Time We Killed, was funded by the Jerome Foundation and
won prizes at Oberhausen, Ann Arbor, Black Maria and many other
festivals. Showing: Skinny Teeth, Elations in Negative, Fear of
Blushing, Girls daydream about Hollywood, We are going home, Chronic.

From the inside cover:

Part Langston Hughes bebop, part Beat  freestyle, part Midwestern folk=20
banter, the work of David E. Patton spans  generations & weaves together a w=
ealth of=20
styles to create a unique &  deeply personal vein of Americana. A gay,=20
largely self-educated black man who  came of age during the turbulence of th=
e=20
Sixties and Seventies, his voice  reverberates with a humble confidence & lo=
nesome=20
strength which at once  saddens & transfixes. Largely uninfluenced by recent=
=20
movements, Patton=E2=80=99s  material remains simple, insightful, & ultimate=
ly some of=20
the most genuine  to exist in modern poetry.

Three poems from Milk Bowl  Moon...:

Johnny=E2=80=99s vision of being romantic
is staring into my  eyes,
room lit by candlelight while Zappa
and the Mothers=E2=80=99 Flower Punk  plays in the background.
Or sitting out in the garden after taking  mushrooms,
acting out the instruction of Ominous Spinach
playing from  speakers in the doorway.

This gift of God is sweet but  dated.

Several times committed to
Ft. Logan Mental Institution in  Denver.
In Boulder, Johnny collects the morning papers from
front yards  and deliver them on the other side of town.

This man of God stands out in  Boulder during winter.

In summer this gift fits in with transients.
He  is saying to strangers on the Boulder Mall,
I am Gabriel come back from  the dead!
Gabriel knows that the first of the year is 1966.
Johnny is  neat but sedated,
chain smoking and throwing curses.
Strapped in his bed  Johnny is saying,
I am Gabriel come back from the  dead!

To be content
to know  just
what a sparrow knows,
you must be
sparrow in your  bones.

Old Mrs. Reagan told us to just say no
to the snow  white girl,
the rock candy cloud,
the smack boy horsing Mary Jane in the  love boat.
But white powder is so sweet to kids
who get the green back  bucks from the streets.
15 year old can make more money than her Dad,
Dad  out there guarding the homes of rich folks,
more than Mama who has given over  her soul
to an absentee landlord,
more than sister-woman  pushing
chemical infested burgers at the Mc,
more than brother-man whose  poor black ass
is teaching capital addiction.

The disinherit see every  day of their lives
the snow queen riches smiling down from billboards
and  hear on the TV screams: buy me, buy me, buy me!

We ain=E2=80=99t shit  without hair care,
without car style,
without bony thin looks in size  six.

We ain=E2=80=99t clean without Tide freshness,
without sunlight in a  bottle,
without lemon cleaning formula,
without cloud soft toiler paper  for your ass.

We ain=E2=80=99t healthy without low calories,
without low  salt,
without low fat.
We ain=E2=80=99t men without Brut Super Dry Extra  Strength,
(buy 2, get 1 free and every woman=E2=80=99ll be at your feet!).
We  ain=E2=80=99t popular without the brand of beer,
without breath smellin of Scope  Original Mint.

Well, scope this=E2=80=94
capitalism thrives on  addiction
and addiction thrives in capitalism.

iDear iList, [the following blurb is from the office of Dr Keston =20
Sutherland]

Not rumour, not barbershop weasel screams in the simulacrum with the =20
candlestick, but FACT:


      _The Unconditional_ by Simon Jarvis


      1-903488-43-5. September 2005. 242 pp. Hardback.
      GBP =A315.00 / USD $35.00

      http://www.barquepress.com/unconditional.html


Extracts from a letter to that author, by this author, previous to =20
the farther vent here advertised of that author's text, all traduced =20
merrily into a blurb:

"...this is a unique poem that I believe no-one else could ever have =20
written. With the word "unique" I risk resembling a mere blurbist, =20
let me try to qualify it, first of all in a rather general way.  It =20
is a poem not only unique in its accomplishment of thinking, into =20
which it earns its way with the most strenuous imaginable commitment, =20=

truly a philosophic song like no other; it is unique also and perhaps =20=

more profoundly in its immense, anannihilative fidelity to the living =20=

need for uniqueness, for the one particularity of uniqueness itself =20
not to be shaded off somewhere into the pastel reserves of a =20
generalisable concepthood but to be here and now, if that's the only =20
place and time where heaven is though not itself at least myself...
     [...] Can a life be so possessed of its own defeat, knowing the =20
full, terrible intimacy of that defeat right up to the least press of =20=

its foot against the earth, that it knows finally how to realise the =20
conceivability of indefeasible life, precisely through the perpetual =20
affliction of owning defeat itself?  Would this be dialele again, a =20
mere dalliance with the toggle key? The second question has to be =20
admitted but only as a condition of rendering the first question =20
capable of getting a positive answer--which of course is never yet to =20=

say that it gets one. But could it get one.  And, or rather, but, is =20
this the only way for life to know the absolute other than by a =20
negative vinculum: to become through ownership of defeat, finally =20
indefeasible?  What could that mean anyhow, to be indefeasible surely =20=

would never mean never to be defeated, unless some part of life =20
laurelised as a "core" is claimed to stand beyond the "accidents" =20
which Aesthetics from Schiller to O'Hara and everywhere else too =20
delegates to something which life does but which it isn't, a Jobless =20
in the wing of himself; and you will not have that, and you uniquely =20
will not, there is no exit from defeat for the ankles and throat =20
unless the thumb and the cock and the clitoris have it too.  This is =20
the problem of immanence, or at least to me it is a problem since I =20
find it increasingly difficult to trust in the hermeneutica sacra of =20
my life that would tell me how much more I need to be wholly in it =20
than even partly out of it, as if any extrusion of myself from the =20
dignity of self-knowledge amounted instantly to an abrogation of the =20
whole crux.  Might the concept of immanence not itself be the deepest =20=

abrogation? Might it not even be this concept (and not the myriad =20
rebukes to its pure conceivability and liveability) which is at root =20
the psycho-historical both-Quell-and-Zwang of the conditionality of =20
all thinking?  I take it that you would not go along with this =20
question; certainly you are fore-armed against it.
     [...] It does all this to me, it works all this thinking into =20
life. But I want to talk also in a more technical or obviously =20
literary way, before I'm carried off nowhere into myself once and for =20=

all.  One great argument of the poem is with the steady obliviation =20
of prosody, by which I mean both the loss of technical and intuitive =20
understanding of verse forms manifest in the mass of current poetry =20
and criticism, and also--a more difficult but crucial idea--the =20
desuetude of the full agility of prosodic thinking manifest not only =20
in literature and culture of all kinds, but also in the lives of =20
millions of people reduced to counting off their workdays like the =20
predictable thuds they most certainly are.  I think I understand =20
this, though I'm sure that your book on prosody will tell me a great =20
deal I don't know, and I'm with you 100%.  I may even harbour a =20
little more millenarianism in my venules, in this regard, than I =20
think you do, since I go on thinking that a thorough storm in the =20
prosodic capillaries might jerk people into something like socialist =20
animation, maybe even what Marx thought of as intellectual self-=20
proletarianisation, if other conditions are favourable; though =20
perhaps despite a few withering passages in your poem (especially pp.=20
197-198) you're not all that far from thinking something similar.  =20
The extremely difficult question I had to face over and over again =20
throughout The Unconditional is whether your genuinely masterful =20
reownership of the "pentameter," for want of a better name, could be =20
the right means to achieve this.  I use the word "means" without =20
really meaning it, again for the sake of keeping the argument moving; =20=

obviously the versification is not simply a "means" to do anything.  =20
I see that there's a compelling lateral argument about tradition in =20
your commitment to that reownership, and if I'm hesitant to agree =20
immediately with your choice of the pentameter I suspect it may be =20
because I'm hesitant to accept that even the "tradition" I think =20
you're interested in is something which we truly need to imagine that =20=

we can remain connected with or even immersed in.  I guess you would =20
say that we are either immersed in it or we opt by default to be =20
alienated from it; and I feel the strength of that objection, but I'm =20=

not yet sure that immersion and alienation are genuine contraries, =20
let alone opposites. Or perhaps I feel, to put it more clearly, that =20
our relation to that tradition need not be defined by the idea that =20
we are still in it but that we might or sometimes do fall out of it.  =20=

My issue with immanence again: I really need to get that cleared up.  =20=

In practical terms that would mean that we don't need to keep writing =20=

pentameters in order to know them.  I do write them in my own work, =20
but always with the intention that they should be conspicuous and =20
somehow interruptive.  Your commitment is far more strenuous here, I =20
admire how you don't want to accept that a verse form "is archaic" =20
merely because some people we call Modernists have declared that it =20
is, and how you force back into the line a tremendous suppleness and =20
detailed power of articulation.  Still, the part of the poem that had =20=

me shuddering, and even crying (I wonder if this will be strange to =20
you), is the late passage, pp.219-226.  And it is what I felt to be =20
the intensity of frustration that overwhelmed me, the sense of an =20
almost catastrophic because almost irreversible loss of constraint =20
after so much effort decisively to abnegate that possibility through =20
relegating all its means of expression to a subordinate mock-status--=20
but in this passage I don't see a subordinated mock (e.g. of the =20
putative freedoms of free verse) but a terrible and beautiful =20
pressure, a rip through the heart of the poem's fabric of self-=20
dissociation.  It seemed to be the most unstable part of the poem, =20
perhaps in one sense the most seriously risky. And the difficult =20
question about the pentameter ends for me, so far, in this form: is =20
the pressure of that late passage possible only because it comes =20
after the great tract of pentameters, or could an even more intense =20
pressure be sustained in another passage of the same kind but more =20
punishingly extended and standing alone, stuck just with itself and =20
where it is, without the counterimbalance of relative prosodic =20
regularity to act as its imprecation?"

I'm sure by now everyone's heard of the new 1957
recording of Coltrane and Monk that's just been
released by Blue Note. It's really fine, and, as a
bonus, a mid-sized essay (dated July 13th, 2005) by
Amiri Baraka opens the collection's liner notes.

The essay's entertaining and the recording's amazing.
Check it out if you haven't.

Best,
Joseph

"Santayana on the Senses of Beauty:  A Poet=E2=80=99s Philosopher=E2=80=99s=20=
Poetics"
Given the principal focus of the earliest  phase of his literary career,=20
George Santayana was even as late as the threshold  of the twentieth century=
=20
better known as a poet than as a philosopher. His first  philosophical publi=
cation,=20
A Sense of Beauty: Being an Outline of Aesthetic  Theory, was a significant=20
contribution to philosophical aesthetics, though a  contribution deeply=20
informed by a unique artistic sensibility. In Reason in Art  (volume four of=
 The Life=20
of Reason), Interpretations of Poetry & Religion,  and Three Philosophical=20
Poets: Lucretius, Dante, & Goethe, Santayana  developed and deepened his nua=
nced=20
account of poetic discourse. In addition to  the finely crafted poems=20
composed in his youth, there is a narratively  compelling novel written in h=
is=20
maturity, The Last Puritan: A Memoir in the Form  of a Novel (a work in whic=
h the=20
genres of memoir and novel, of a distinctive  form of autobiography and the=20
uniquely modern form of fictional narrative, are  self-consciously fused=20
together). The letters of Wallace Stevens as well as the  recently published=
 ones of=20
Robert Lowell reveal that Santayana was, early and  late, a poet=E2=80=99s p=
hilosopher,=20
a philosophical author to whom working poets  consistently turned for=20
inspiration as much as insight, for poetic ideas as much  as philosophical g=
uidance.=20
Why such important poets as Stevens and Lowell were  so drawn to the figure=20=
and=20
writings of Santayana is a question worthy of  careful, focused=20
consideration. In addressing just this question in my  presentation, I hope=20=
to illuminate=20
Santayana=E2=80=99s poetics, on the one side, and  facets of Stevens=E2=80=
=99 and Lowell=E2=80=99s=20
poetry otherwise left obscure, on the other. The  subtle interplay between t=
he=20
poetic and the philosophical is nowhere more  manifest and indeed legible th=
an=20
in the complex relationship between this poetic  philosopher and these=20
philosophical poets. The senses of beauty, the irreducible  multiplicity of=20=
arresting=20
forms (ones having the power to seize and hold that  unique species of human=
=20
attentiveness identifiable as aesthetic engagement), are  celebrated in vari=

ways in George Santayana=E2=80=99s philosophical texts and in  effect exempl=

Presentation: "Three Faces of Form: Classical, Buddhist, and  Ecological"
The western concern with aesthetic form derives from the Greeks,  though it=20
is often misunderstood as a static formalism. I will begin by trying  to=20
retrieve the Greek understanding of form as "self-limiting or controlled  po=
wer=20
achieving an end," using examples from Homer, Sappho, and Plato. I will  the=
n turn=20
to a very different approach found in the Buddhist teaching: "form is =20
emptiness; emptiness is form." Here, form becomes the "suchness" of an =20
interconnected and transitory world, which in aesthetics comes to be express=
ed  in the=20
Japanese ideas of wabi and sabi. I will use examples from Chinese and  Japan=
ese=20
poetry to illustrate. Finally, I will propose an "ecological"  conception of=
=20
form as a dynamic pattern of creative growth that is connected  with the=20
environing world. In particular I will urge that recovering an  aesthetic ex=
perience=20
grounded in the natural world is a necessary condition of  developing our=20
capacity to care for it. I will use examples from Mary Oliver's  poetry to c=
larify=20
this idea.

=20
some short  comments. The title of his reading is =E2=80=9CBeyond beyond=E2=
=80=9D (part of a=20
Shakespeare  line), and the main theme both of the poetry and of the comment=

will be the  relationship between poetry and the sacred. Valesio will be=20
accompanied by his  principal translator, Graziella Sidoli, who will be read=
ing her=20
English  translations of his work.


Graziella Sidoli is the founder and editor of PolyText (a journal featuring=20=

"Sound Scraps, Vision Scraps": Interpreting and  Overinterpreting Paul Celan=
"
From Heidegger, who attended Celan's 1967  reading at Freiburg and invited=20
him to visit his H=C3=BCtte, to Gadamer, Derrida,  Lacoue-Labarthe, and late=
r=20
American theorists, Celan has become an icon for  post-structuralist philoso=
phers,=20
the poet whose lyric embodies post-World War II  doctrines of speech, silenc=
e,=20
and the nature of writing. But in thus treating  Celan's lyric hermeneutical=
ly,=20
its poeticity is curiously underplayed. The what  of Celan (allegorical=20
readings of individual words and phrases have been  endless) is well underst=
ood,=20
but the how remains a mystery. It is that how I  wish to discuss here.
(Note: I will probably bring in Wittgenstein as a  counter-philosopher who=20
can help us contra Derrida's "Shibboleth" and related  treatments of Celan).

"Henri Bergson: the superabundance of the real"
A central aspect of  Bergson=E2=80=99s work is the critique of our tendency=20=
to=20
confuse our conceptual  representations of the world with the lived experien=
ce that=20
they are used to  simplify. The result is a world-view that minimizes the=20
importance of human  life.
=20
Among the characteristics of our experience are: 1) The presence of =20
qualitative features that could not be reduced to quantity. 2) The  =E2=80=
=9Cinterpenetration=E2=80=9D
 of the various aspects of experience, namely their lack of  definite=20
boundaries and their tendency to connect with one another in ways that  cann=
ot be=20
described as simply mixing or merging. 3) The inescapable temporality  of ou=
r=20
experience. Conceiving time on the model of space is useful for many  purpos=
es,=20
but when that is done the result is an abstraction, not an experienced =20
reality. 4)    The =E2=80=9Csuperabundance=E2=80=9D of the real, as being  i=
ncapable of being=20
captured in any conceptual system.
=20
One of the most important results of Bergson=E2=80=99s reconstruction of phi=
losophy =20
is that it shows that esthetic experience has a vital role in human  life.

=20
Make a Wish: The Effect of Language in St=C3=A9phane Mallarm=C3=A9's and Jam=

Merrill's Poems.
The combination of absolute control and maximum effect  (l'effet) in an idea=
l=20
poetic form provided the leader of the French symbolist  movement, St=C3=A9p=
hane=20
Mallarm=C3=A9, with the key to what he called pure notions, pure  language,=20=
a way to=20
express the otherwise ineffable. Yet in order to reach the  effect he sought=
,=20
he had to let language speak beyond its signified, and how to  liberate=20
language while keeping complete control over it?
Almost a century  later, James Merrill, an American poet fond of Mallarm=C3=
=A9's=20
work, used many of  Mallarm=C3=A9's techniques, so that their works display=20
sometimes uncanny  similarities. Yet one thing Merrill did not keep: the wis=
h for=20
perfection. In  fact, for Merrill imperfection was the key to pure symbolist=
=20
poems, and this  presentation will show how Merrill may have more easily ach=
ieved=20
the symbolism  Mallarm=C3=A9 sought, thanks to a touch of imperfection.

 In a wonderful, understated and refreshing evening of international poets
at the S.F. State Poetry Center last Friday featured Eleni Stecipoulos (USA
- with a fascinating, historic based poem rooted in Buffalo past and present
with a bow to Artaud on plague and illness), Kai Nieminen (Finland - in dry
witful translations by Anselm Hollo - in fact, Kai looks - fully bearded -
like Anselm),_Nora Gomringer (German - wonderful "slam" performer and
daughter of the great German-Bolivian concrete poet) and Dunya Mikell
(Iraq/USA). Mikell's poems of the war could cut ice - informed, smart, and
satiric to the core. I hope her work is getting around. It's great to hear
well writ stuff from inside, from the subjects of the suffering from the
condition, the war.

She who writes Baghdad Burning is now back more frequently and interestingly
so on giving the account of the run up to this weekends' vote. I continue to
find her voice refreshingly sanguine in relationship to the continuous Bush
Ad fiction spin. (Since both Karl Rove and Scooter Libby are on notice via
the NY Times' Judith Miller's suck up et al, and it's probably
professionally highly embarrassing for apparently a whole group of reporters
to have been their 'privileged' Iraq spinners - it will be curious to now
see which reporters for which Admin intermediaries now line up to report Con
Rice's and Bush's Iraq accounts as 'truth.') Fortunately I think much of the
American public - via the polls - are poking through the veil. When and if
Rove and Scooter get nailed by Fitzgerald in the Plame/Flame case, it will
be curious to see if Cheney and Bush get named as "unindicted
co-conspirators."

Subject:      New York Times on Landis Everson
MIME-Version: 1.0

I was waiting for Ron S. to post this, but I'll do it
myself.  This New York Times piece seemed to me
curiously inoffensive, considering the sins of the New
York Times, though of course listing "mythological and
Biblical references" as something *separating* the
Berkeley Renaissance from "East Coast formalism" is
utterly wrong.

I'm glad at least one good thing--this Emily Dickinson
award--is developing from the Lilly bequest.


Poet, 79, Wins Prize and New Audience

             By DINITIA SMITH

Published: October 17, 2005

CHICAGO - Why did Landis Everson stop writing poetry
for 43 years?

The question arose last week, after the Poetry
Foundation awarded Mr. Everson its newly created prize
for a writer over 50 who has never published a book.

The poet Landis Everson at the poetry awards ceremony.


Mr. Everson, 79, quiet, pixieish and a little frail
after a cataract operation, answered, smiling,
"Imagine, if you had written a letter to a friend in
Chicago and you never had an answer, and you kept
writing and writing and not getting any answer back,
would you keep writing?" No matter. Mr. Everson will
now receive the Emily Dickinson First Book Award of
$10,000, with publication of his book underwritten by
the foundation.

It was not that Mr. Landis's poetry had been rejected,
but rather that, for him, poetry is a communication
between friends, not a commercial enterprise. "I
wasn't seeing my friends," he said simply.

Those friends were among the poets who became known as
the Berkeley Renaissance writers: Robert Duncan, Jack
Spicer, Robin Blaser. Although each poet's work was
different, they were rebelling against East Coast
formalism - their writing was full of symbolist
imagery, colloquialisms, mythological and Biblical
references; it was sometimes obscene, sometimes
homoerotic. (Mr. Everson is the boy in Duncan's
"Venice Poem": "his eye/ is fixt upon the boy's eye -
/ as if he saw all love was frozen there").

Born in Coronado, Calif., where his father was a naval
officer, Mr. Everson attended the University of
California, Berkeley, and earned a master's degree at
Columbia University. He played a hoax on the English
department by writing a thesis on an imaginary
17th-century poet, Sir William Bargoth. (The joke was
discovered, but the department accepted his thesis
anyway. ) Mr. Everson published poetry in some very
good magazines: The Hudson Review, The Kenyon Review,
Poetry. After moving to San Francisco, he met weekly
with his poet friends who began experimenting with
dictated or "serial poetry," unmediated language
directly from the poet's mind. But there were romantic
squabbles and quarrels over style.

In 1961, the group disbanded. Without his friends for
an audience, Mr. Everson stopped writing. He taught,
painted, bought old houses and renovated them. He
moved to San Luis Obispo, "because I didn't know
anyone there," he said.

Around 1994, he ceased renovating houses. He was too
old. So he did crossword puzzles, gardened and played
with two blue jays that he had tamed. "They eat out of
my hand," he said. "I was waiting to die, very
patiently, very agreeably, when the phone rang."

It was Ben Mazer, a young Boston poet and editor
writing an essay on the Berkeley Renaissance for the
poetry annual, Fulcrum. Mr. Mazer had traced Mr.
Everson and asked if he had any unpublished poems. He
did, and Mr. Mazer published them in Fulcrum. With Mr.
Mazer's encouragement, Mr. Everson began writing
again. Mr. Mazer sent his work to journals, and it was
accepted, including by The New Republic, which
published "Coronado Poet."

In "Coronado Poet," which Mr. Everson read at the
prize ceremony, he might have been describing himself:
"I stay upright," Mr. Everson wrote, "Nothing makes me
go down dusty roads to change my style./ I don't
believe in love anymore, the foghorn/ blasted it out
of me."

Unbeknownst to Mr. Everson, Mr. Mazer submitted his
poems for the Poetry Foundation prize. He won, and Mr.
Mazer will edit the book to be published by Graywolf
Press.

When Mr. Everson heard about the prize, he became
depressed, he said. He didn't sleep, didn't eat. "I
realized all the fun and games had gone out of poetry;
it was becoming professional," he said. But his
spirits have lifted. "Without Ben, I wouldn't be
writing," Mr. Everson said. "I have an audience."

The Dickinson prize is particularly apt because it
comes from the donation to the foundation by the Eli
Lilly pharmaceutical heiress Ruth Lilly, 90, who has
also written poetry. Her donation was announced in
2002, and it will eventually amount to about $175
million.

Ms. Lilly, who was institutionalized for depression,
sent poems to Poetry magazine for years, but they had
been rejected.

No one at the foundation had met Ms. Lilly, who has
recovered from her illness with the aid of Prozac, a
drug developed by her family's company. For her
birthday in August, however, the foundation printed a
private edition of her poems and drawings, and she
distributed the collection, "A Little Book," to
friends and family at her birthday party. After years
of rejection, her work was in book form at last.

Mr. Landis and Ms. Lilly were not the only ones
receiving gifts from the foundation. On Oct. 6, at the
glittering awards ceremony on the glass-enclosed stage
of the Jay Pritzker Pavilion in Millennium Park, a new
$10,000 award for criticism went to the poet and
critic William Logan. "What were they thinking?" Mr.
Logan asked. "Critics are insects, as everyone knows,
one of the plagues that poets have to bear."

The Mark Twain award for humor went to Tony Hoagland.
He also mentioned insects, in a love poem. "If she
were a female walkingstick bug she might," he read,
"insert her hypodermic proboscis delicately into my
neck."

Before the prize ceremony, Mr. Barr gave a rundown of
some of the Lilly money expenditures.

He said the foundation, with the National Opinion
Research Center at the University of Chicago, is
conducting one of the largest surveys ever of
attitudes toward poetry. The findings will be
published in early 2006.

The foundation is building an immense online poetry
archive. Together with the National Endowment for the
Arts, it sponsored a recitation contest this year for
high school students in Chicago and Washington, D.C.
Winners received $1,000 each, and the contest is going
national.

The foundation also sponsors Garrison Keillor's poetry
radio program, "Writer's Almanac." John Barr, a poet
and the foundation's president, said the show "is
syndicated to 300 stations and reaches two million
listeners weekly." In addition, the foundation,
together with the Library of Congress, has an
"American Life in Poetry" program that gives
newspapers poems and commentary by the nation's poet
laureate, Ted Kooser. Finally, it has also
underwritten a direct-mail campaign and a redesign for
Poetry magazine, doubling circulation to 21,000 since
2003.

J. D. McClatchy, a poet and editor of the Yale Review,
said he applauded many of the foundation's
initiatives, especially the new essays in Poetry,
which contain "a serious dialogue about poetry."

But as for having a humor prize in general, he said,
"they seem to be aiming low." "They want their
initiatives to be popular and populist," Mr. McClatchy
said. "The trouble with money is, it can't make good
poetry."

we wanted to let you know, in case you didn’t, that
How2 has recently moved to a new site, having
collected its archives for both HOW(ever) (yes! it’s
true. all online almost precisely as the paper copies
looked) and How2 all under one roof, so to speak.  our
thanks to John Sparrow in England, who did an
incredible job creating the site.

it's true, women don't find themselves today in the
same space they found themselves in when HOW(ever)
first launched.  but reason still stands that not same
does not equal everything's fine. it's warm today and
Lauren Shufran and Alli Warren want to say spur --
let's breathe some attention and excitement back into
How2's postcard section.

if you look at the current issue, you’ll note the
section is really very much lacking at present.
postcard was originally created to serve as an open
space for women to contribute and to dialogue,
regardless of how much or little uninterrupted time
they had…but recent posts show it’s become more a
bulletin board for announcements, and so really hasn’t
been utilized in a way that’s productive, per se, in
quite awhile.

of course now the archives are at a site which makes
them much easier to access, and we’re hoping to revive
this section once again.  it's our hope that our
collective attentive care will make this space a
productive one for sharing insights and questions in a
not-too-hard-to-submit postcard form. as in 'Greetings
From Here,' this is what we’re thinking about.  the
archives at http://www.how2journal.com/archive/,
especially those in HOW(ever) embody the gist of its
original energies, conversations, etc.  what are you
reading and how is it particularly significant for
women or, how might it rotate about a female axis?
what kinds of questions should we be asking and what
manner of answers are we seeking?

as of now, the last editor’s address is still up on
the site, so until the next issue arrives, you can
send your thoughts to laurenshufran@yahoo.com or to
Alli at alliwarren@hotmail.com.  also please spread
the word to anyone who seems like a potential
postcard-writer, which generally is obvious from one’s
gait as well as from purchases made at the
supermarket.  so keep your eyes open.


thanks.  we’re both very much looking forward to being
part of this revival,

love,
Your New Editors in Solidarity,
Lauren & Alli

".....at a time when I am speaking to you about the paradox of desire -- in
the
sense that different goods obscure it -- you can hear outside the awful
language
of power.  There's no point in asking whether they are sincere or
hypocritical,
whether they want peace of whether they calculate the risks.  The dominating
impression as such a moment is that something that may pass for a prescribed
good; information addresses and captures impotent crowds to whom it is poured

forth like a liquor that leaves them dazed as they move toward the slaughter
house.
One might even ask if one would allow the cataclysm to occur without first
giving
free reign to this hubbub of voices...."

FREE THE P! PALESTINE TAKES NYC'S EAST VILLAGE BY STORM
Remi Kanazi, The Electronic Intifada, 17 October 2005

As I walk down the darkened staircase into a muggy
basement in this lower eastside dive bar, a scruffily
bearded supporter smiles and waves a four-foot wide
Palestinian flag. The chatter begins as the room fills
with anxious people awaiting the show. The young crowd
came out to support Free the P, the new CD compilation of
"hip-hop and spoken word, dedicated to the youth of
Palestine." The proceeds will go to Slingshot Hip-hop, "a
documentary film that focuses on the daily life of
Palestinian rappers living in Gaza, the West Bank and
inside Israel." Within moments, our hostess, Arab-American
comedienne Maysoon Zayid, takes the ground level,
makeshift stage and gets the crowd going with her dry,
political humor....

"Beautiful Duchess"
by Randall Williams

Beautiful duchess, you are memorabilia and a pair of crow eyes. Red and black
flecks cover my tilted leaves. Two black squares joke a rain of sorcery and
wood. I have disassembled the tanning bed, the silver hamper and put them into a
box. Two blue Recycling bins mediate my view of the Republicans across the
street. My viewfinder yields sound: a river of needles, an ocean of birds, I-40
outside Amarillo. Meager, meager, North Carolina, our hands are what we have.
Awkward temples, coasts in migration, verbs bellowing in sentiment and sediment.
Can we be fed by the familiar? Can we chart below the temporary? Invisible
closings, stationary and snaking, encircle me like crushed jacks. Young
Southerners are not smiling, but gritting their teeth. And yet. My sleeping
turns the rooster’s crow into a guitar riff. Airwaves fearlessly stretch into
silence and obliterate logjams of sonicity. Beautiful duchess, entry without
aftermath, I throw woven bottomless baskets into the street before your house.

I suspect the trap-door is opening and what was an attempt at stealth is
kaput.=20

In the Washington Post:
Posted at 11:03 AM ET, 10/18/2005

Miers Backed Abortion Ban
Jesse J. Holland of AP reports:

Supreme Court nominee Harriet Miers pledged support in 1989 for a
constitutional amendment banning abortions except when necessary to save th=
e
life of the mother, according to material given to the Senate on Tuesday.
=B3If Congress passes a Human Life Amendment to the Constitution that would
prohibit abortion except when it was necessary to prevent the death of the
mother, would you actively support its ratification by the Texas
Legislature,=B2 asked an April 1989 questionnaire sent out by the Texans
United for Life group.
Miers checked =B3yes=B2 to that question, and all of the group=B9s questions,
including whether she would oppose the use of public moneys for abortions
and whether she would use her influence to keep
=B3pro-abortion=B2 people off city health boards and commissions...
***

& now off to another circus, one in which the Right will declare its right
to own the court. This new nomination should get really weird taking place,
will, in the media brou-haha and felony shake outs of Libby and Rove in the
upcoming indictments in the Valerie Plame announcements.

Ever the optimist here!

This is great Murat, very enjoyable.  I agree with lots & disagree with =
lots.  I have a hard time thinking of poetry as work.  I'd like to go =
around talking about "the work" because I used to love hearing my painter =
and sculptor friends do that, and be sort of in awe.  But it's not "the =
work" to me.  It's a sort of practice: maybe somewhere between a musical =
instrument, a religion, & a game.  I disagree with you (or your former =
self) about audience too.  Writing is a must & a lot of fun but there's =
more once it's done (I don't know where those rhymes are coming from).  =
You say:=20

"The poem is its writing * the poet writes to feel good, to experience the =
sense of discovery and power by converting a mental sound into physical =
sound. The moment that occurs the poem dies for the poet * as a climax =
dies * then to the next one. What happens to the poem afterwards is, =
essentially, meaningless."

I think the writing is only Act 1.  I'm not interested in the ideal =
audience for whom the language of my poetry is "transparent, blindingly =
clear."  The language of my poetry is already blindingly clear to just =
about anyone.  I want the actual audience.  When I write a poem I go out =
in the street and stop people.  I'm a smash-and-grab hold-up kind of poet. =
 There's only so far I can go with my own delight.

I agree with you about money, though poems can be interestingly-shaped =
money, and there is a thriving barter & trade economy where poems =
translate into couches & dinners & apartments & chapbooks & books, =
letters, emails, more poems: friendships.

I think your phrase "The Gash Money's Absence" or even "The Gash Money's =
Absence Digs" would be an interesting title for (something!).

I like how you refer to the poet as "it":  "The obsessive theme of every =
American poet worth its salt ...!

I like your Post Script on the Sufism of the American Poem.  It reminds me =
of Bob Marley.  "Hit me with music .... Brutalize me!!"  There's no way I =
can do justice to that in print.  All the vowels are diphthongs, all the =
consonants bitter-sweet.

i enjoyed the (paraphrased) american poems are the landscape of the spirit.
i think the bit about addicts is a bit grandiose as junkies don't think
their product can change the world (in my experience, it just wrecks their
own and ripples out from there)

all in all, a sound essay tho

hey, but it sounds like someone is speaking with
cotton in their mouth.  spelling/grammar are not
"important", but they are a part of "manners" as it
were.  and this isn't exactly an innocent example.
the passage refers to the itself.  we take all manner
of shortcuts as readers (really good readers on this
list), not just at the level of letter.

the "importance" of spelling isn't
semantic--particularly in a language which doesn't
have spelling rules so much as guidelines and
convention--it's about "manners" or style as it were.
it's also about audience.  if I write "tho" in email,
i know it won't be must understood.  but in other
contexts, I am not so sure.  and what about a passage
that has no familiarity to it?  in any case, the real
boundary in language is grammar.  and this passage,
badly spelled as it is, is entirely conventional on
that score.

At Theatre Notes this week: the continuing adventures of Little Alison at
the Melbourne Festival.

Le Dernier Caravans=E9rail (Odyss=E9es), devised by the company, directed by
Ariane Mnouchkine.  Th=E9=E2tre de Soleil, Royal Exhibition Building, Carlton
Gardens.=20

17th October 2005=20

Dear Ariane=20

I hope you will forgive me for addressing you so familiarly, since I have
never met you.  Writing a letter seems, perhaps not so strangely, the only
fit way to address Le Dernier Caravans=E9rail (Odyss=E9es) .  I saw both parts
in one long and dizzying Sunday and it makes me want to say many things tha=
t
you must already know.  Principally, I wish to say that I witnessed
something beautiful, a work of theatre that left me moved and shaken.

But this is already inadequate.  Beauty is so often taken to mean the
anodyne, the conventional; to be moved suggests a surfeit of sentiment.  Th=
e
work of your company is so far from the anodyne and sentimental, the
deadliness of the worthy, that in writing about it I fear misrepresenting
the breathtaking honesty and directness of its aesthetic.

well,

i guess i've been drifting further and further away from poetry as such,
but there still may be something of interest to "poetics" on my blog:

William T. Vollmann
Tuesday, October 25
5:30-7:00
Mills College, Oakland
Directions: http://www.mills.edu/maps/index.php

**Note: reading will be in the Chapel, not Mills Hall Living Room**

William T. Vollmann is the famously prolific author of eight novels,
three collections of stories, a memoir, and Rising Up and Rising Down
(McSweeney’s Books, 2003), a seven-volume treatise on human violence.
(Ecco Press published the 752-page abridged version in 2004.) A project
twenty years in the making, Rising Up and Rising Down was a finalist for
the 2003 National Book Critics Circle Award. Stephen Moore of the
Washington Post names it “a monumental achievement on several levels: as
a hair-rising survey of mankind's propensity for violence, as a one-man
attempt to construct a system of ethics…and as a demonstration of the
importance of empathy, whether in writing a book like this or simply
dealing with fellow human beings.” Vollmann's writing has been published
in The New Yorker,  Spin,  Harpers, Esquire, The Paris Review,
Conjunctions, Granta, and many other magazines.  He lives in Sacramento,
California.

Tony Rudolf's Wine from two Glasses contains a quote of Oppen's. I'm having trouble locating the source.  Any idea where this came from?  I've checked the Selected Letters and the various daybooks/working papers published in Ironwood, Conjunction, Sulfur, Iowa Review, etc. No help from the Rudolf's bibliography:

 (p. 13): "I broke off the book and the writing of poetry for that search once more on the actual ground, and returned to poetry only when we knew we had failed."

Dear Ross--i wouldn't at all say you are drfiting further and further away
from poetry

Dear friends:

A poet friend of mine asked me to locate the following line from
Berryman's Dream Songs:



      Those lady poets must not marry....

That's an approximation.....   could be " should not marry"

Your help in locating the poem and hopefully a full quote of the poem
would be much appreciated.

Thank you.

Benjamin

Hey, Benjamin, I found it right in the index of first lines:

187
Them lady poets must not marry, pal.
Miss Dickinson--fancy in Amherst bedding her.
Fancy a lark with Sappho,
a tumble in the bushes with Miss Moore,
a spoon with Emily, while Charlotte glare.
Miss Bishop's too noble-O.

That was the lot. And two of them are here
as yet, and--and: Sylvia Plath is not.
She--she her credentials
has handed in, leaving alone two tots
and widower to what he makes of it--
surviving guy, &

when Tolstoy's pathetic widow doing her whung
(after them decades of marriage) & kids, she decided he was queer
& loving his agent.
Wherefore he rush off, leaving two journals, and die.
It is a true error to marry with poets
or to be by them.



Best,

Tod

Forgive me if someone has already forwarded this information, but I hope
folks know about the fine work Jason Dewinitz is doing over at
Greenboathouse Books. Admittedly I may be a bit biased as I've just had
the pleasure of recieving author copies of my own book, but really, I'm
just awed by the physical beauty of the book itself--of all the books
they've published:Jason Rhodes, Meredith Quartermain. If you aren't
familiar with Greenboathouse do check out their website:

Christophe,

E. Dickinson's lines, ""I play at Riches - to appease/ The Clamoring for Gold
-" express best what writing poetry means to me -a play- a positive counter
assertion of the mind against the "realities" of the world. For that instant -a
poem as an instantaneous act- the poem is all there is.

I am aware this is so far from the concepts of tradition, good or bad poem,
significance, etc.; but it represents I think what writing poetry involves,
particularly in communities where poetry has no currency, no clear social
function. That function has to be "imagined" -as a gesture of potential- instead of
creating "real" poetic communities, such as language, post language, first
generation New York School, second generation New York schools, etc. These
classifications, in my opinion, obfuscate rather than clarifying the reality of what
the poets are doing.

In our culture -perhaps in all global culture- a poem is really read by
another person by accident -tangentially- when one sees in another's text something
which he or she can injest, often, by misreading it. In fact, the more
drastic and irrevocable the misreading, the more powerful the reading, the greater
the opening up of the original poem beyond itself.

An American poem -which basically has a sealed identity- or the poem of
another culture which is sealed to the Americans- can only be opened up, socialized
through misreadings.

Wystan Curnow's MODERN COLOURS  was launched recently at Parsons
Bookshop in Auckland.
Besides poetry and prose there are images (in colour) on its 48
french-folded pages.
It's publisher is Jack Books (www.jackbooks.com) and it can be purchased

Wystan Curnow is one of New Zealand's best loved poets. Well anyway he
feels this way at the moment.
'Mondriian's Restaurant' , the longest piece in the book,  appeared in
Landfall  last year. It  was selected
by the National Insitute of Arts & Letters, as one of the ten best New
Zealand poems of 2004, which was
nice for it, although when I was younger this was calling skitting and
frowned upon. =20

The Immersion of New Orleans

Nicholas Ruiz III



Sometimes a city must be sacrificed, so that people can exhale.  The omnilateral
spreading of our species can only be furthered as hope floats away from the city
of New Orleans. Like the recent New Orleans displacee said in the television
news, "Now I can leave this town! I've never had such an
opportunity!"--that and on his way to Houston to get some pants.  Courage or
recklessness?  Perhaps the only difference is in winning and losing.  If those
on the inside can see us, those of us on the outside of New Orleans, on the
outside of the world?s latest sacrificial offering, can attempt to see past
the context of media obliteration, past the screening of the immersion of New
Orleans.
        Of course, every smile of the media clown has its sinister lining, and
for us non-participants, a sign of the real hidden joy borne by the hosts of
the new victims manifests itself in baleful anticipation, as the gun sales rise
in the cities that receive our American refugees, an ironic greeting for the
displacees of New Orleans.  In the midst of the mediated screen of Texan
empathy lies the factual fear of absorption.  Not to be outdone, back in the
disaster zone, the Gulf coast reveals its own ironies; casinos (Mississippi
claims 10% of its state budget reflects casino taxation) highlighting the
simulation of southern values in the Bible belt.  Especially the holiest of His
states fill their state coffers with the excesses of extracurricular Sunday
evening slot machines and paper-bagged beer.  Another reminder of the
supplementary speculation we call the just economy.
        Too much goodness in our hearts, minds and screens--but little to be
found on the freshly looted streets filling with the muscle and hate of that
ultra-postmodern Venice.  Unlike Venice, which took years to flood, New Orleans
was flooded in a few hours.  The city of New Orleans itself is a speculation
gone bad, wedged as it was between two gargantuan sources of water, below sea
level, damned and leveed for the always spreading masses.  Speculations hold
that development contracts will explode all over the city map, as the bidding
wars begin and a "new" New Orleans is sure to rise as quickly as they can
pump the water out of the old one.  I liked New Orleans, for what it's worth.
        How to imbibe this event?  What is its meaning? What is our new
ontological location, now that that another "world-changing" cataclysmic event
has occurred.  A chance for the do-gooders to do good; the finger-pointers to
point fingers; Bush isn't responsible for the severity of our complacency, and
the aristocrats merely capitalize upon it?despite the editorial pieces and
listserv diatribes of the free-thinkers; a chance for the speculators to place
new bets, build bigger casinos, build them inland and get it right this time,
so the Good News poker hands will never have to fold?  I say forget about New
Orleans and build a new city, in a new American place, maybe in Iraq, where at
least the imbecility is out in the open and not hidden in the barrio waiting
for a hurricane to uncover it. Now that would be honest.  Infinite casinos in
the desert?we specialize in that, no?
          We began and continue our new millennium with the entire prowess of
flies, taking off and landing, repeatedly wherever we can, leaving our urine
and feces behind.  The dissolution of New Orleans reminds us of our shit, we
still refuse to take care of.
           Cash for the victims is a sign of the metaphysics of Capital, where
suffering is always bought and paid for.  New Orleans signifies the lightness
of our new locations, new Capital, new identities, all tokens that we are,
unbeknownst to ourselves, still alive and reprogrammable--all we can hope for
is a hurricane to remind us.  Perhaps then, we can start again.  In the eye of
the ruin lies our hope and our souvenir of where we have been and where we are
going. But the survivors of the storm will instead be turned into the
sacrificial bread to be broken at the mediated dinner table of the world,
reminding us all of how "good" we've got it.
        If the ambiguity of New Orleans as an event leaves us feeling a little
light, a bit nauseated; there is always the laceration of Capital to wake us
from our sympathetic malaise.  Positions have already been taken--go long the
builders, developers, clean-up outfits and architectural face-lifters and short
the casinos, retail setups and insurance companies with heavy exposure in the
Gulf. Just another day on the trading floor of our lives.  What New Orleans
offers us is a bit of exposure--another crack in the surface of the screen; 9/11
made a similar offering.  New Orleans shows us that humanity prefers its
empathetic compassion to be best delivered from the barrel of a gun--or at
least, best dispensed when the police are on duty.  Chaos does not envelop us
during tragedy, rather chaos saves us from the banal machinations of our undead
lives.
     For those of us that are eternally watching the events unfold, the screens
of New Orleans show us all that nothing can save us from ourselves--like so
many of the police that never showed when called for duty during those irregular
days of our latest pandemonium. One might be tempted to say that the great
white American underbelly lies exposed and fully parched in the full heat of
the still-burning spotlights of that late, great city of New Orleans.

phenomena of interference
steven dalachinsky (words)
with Matthew Shipp (piano)
cover art by yuko otomo
recorded at Tonic - July 23, 2005
mastered & produced by assif tsahar
available from hopscotch records

Ever since I discovered Steve's work I've been curious to know if he
really
understands what he's talking about. His poetry seemed to me more  like
my
hypnogogic-hypnopompic dream language. You know the place, where color
and sound
and word interchange to make non-sense? But now I know differently.
Dalachinsky is a poet, himself a medium where all these conspire to
produce  singular
works of art. He makes a coherently perceptible phenomenon from the
chaos
commonly called knowledge. This earth is a colorful cacophonous place
where the
music of the spheres and "blood and piss and shit" combine to make
something
worth remembering, though we probably won't. Perhaps the feelings can
remain
for awhile via the technology we so easily dismiss. Did you know  that
the
iridescence of a CD is caused by the interference of light waves?

Matthew Shipp's music and Yuko Otomo's cover art elegantly interfere with

Steve's words to produce what I believe is his best work so far. Color?
He's
always spoken passionately about it like someone who's suddenly rendered

color-blind, someone shredded by their desire to see it again. The color
of fruit,
the blue of the sky, all of it unmasked from  its grayscale disguise.
With
this album he has found the physics of his poetry.  Steve typically
expresses a
Zen comprehension of the something that emerges  from nothing, and the
music
that arises from silence; but he now reveals a  recognition of the
principles of
physics, the (un)predictability of a quantum  universe. He serves up a
delicious platter or palette of sound and shadow, a  digestible meal with
all senses
commingling. One word suggests others and a  sound suggests a word or a
color
or traffic sign. "Doors" are always closing but  a window is sometimes a
way
out.

It's the raucous NYC microcosm with schizoid shamans playing "Blackjack",

and where "Gal I Leo" stargazes but plays us a no-frill evening, selling
us the
myth of meaning in the "Subway Systems."

chill   reflect the myriad
of hopefuls & the din's aswirlin here
like the way reason flames this season . . .

But my words don't do his words justice. You have to  hear him interject
"copyright", "click", "imprint", "omit", "emit",  "money", "honest", and
"flush"
repeatedly throughout the pome to appreciate  his juxtaposition of a
night sky
with consumerism.

How can I describe "3 orchids for niblock"? Chthonic, erotic, primal?
Uttering glossolalia, he speaks a ménage à trois straining to give birth
to
something, but what? The impossible, the inexpressible.

"trust fund babies" of both kinds, the "other-colors America and the Ezra

Pounds.

The directness of "embracement"

      if I travel with You
      further than this Spot
      beyond my discontent
         to embracement
         to silence
      & springtime

You could read the entire lyrics booklet from this beautifully  packaged
CD
and never come close to what you will taste and experience when you  hear
him
bust a sound wave. Dalachinsky has never performed with more intensity.
He
finds it all by losing it. Nostalgia is a promise of what never remains.
We'll
have to do this again some day. "Letters can form more than words . . .
do  you
ever dot your eyes before you look?"

French folding is when the page edge is a fold rather than a cut. It's
the term my designer applied to it.
You get fewer pages of text, but you can used thinner paper and get no
see-through, also it gives the 'slim tome' =20

Those of you who are subscribers to The World know that the Poetry Project
has a new poetry mag called The Recluse. We are going back to our DIY roots=
,
though Santo at The Source has replaced the mimeo machine. The gloss cover,

features a cover image by Jane Hammond and work by Renee Gladman, John Yau,
Lisa Robertson, Chris Carnevale, Ted Greenwald, Marcella Durand, Macgregor
Card, Rebecca Kosick and Jean Day. This premiere issue was edited by the
Poetry Project team of Anselm Berrigan, Miles Champion and Corina Copp.
Someday, Issue #2 will be brought to you by Anselm Berrigan, Stacy Szymasze=
k
and Corrine Fitzpatrick. The editors regret that they are not reading
unsolicited work at this time, but if you would like to order an issue
please email us at info@poetryproject.com.

*** The editorial staff of The Recluse is planning for issue no. 2 to appea=
r
in late winter/early spring. While we aren't accepting work for issue no. 2=
,
beginning with issue no. 3 we will be encouraging and welcoming submissions=

dear Poetics & denizens thereof,

this is to note, I've liately entered the blogosphere,
namely & to wit, here:
http://kirwani.blogspot.com/

Those hastening, slowing, or stumbling by
are apt to find a mix of poetry (typically
formalish), glimpses of some oilpainting,
and smatterings of "reflective prose" --
perhaps a tad of fiction in future.
Also some attention to an eclectic links
sidebar, cold bar, or oyster bar.
Not to mention the blogo-graffiti.

-----------

Michael Coffey is the author of the recent CMYK (O Books, 2004), which Stev=
e
McCaffery describes as =B3a linguistic world in which the intertextual and th=
e
programmatic commingle in paralogical yet over-determined neighborhoods,
along streets or boulevards where the Mojave Blancheur is made to rule as
much as spaghetti is from a mussel shell=8Aread it then ruminate on the
vertiginous remainder Language was, is and can be.=B2

E. Tracey Grinnell is the author of the forthcoming Some Clear Souvenir (O
Books, 2005), is the editor of Litmus Press, and edits the journal Aufgabe.

Brenda Iijima is the author of Around Sea (O Books, 2004). Her book Animate
& Inanimate Aims is forthcoming from Litmus Press. Some of her work can be
viewed on-line at Call Review and Fauxpress. She lives in Brooklyn, New Yor=
k
where she edits Portable Press at Yo-Yo Labs.

Paolo Javier is the author of 60 lv bo(e)mbs (O Books, 2005) and the time a=
t
the end of this writing (Ahadada Books). He lives in New York.

Susan Landers debut collection is 248 mgs., a panic picnic (O Books, 2003).
Kevin Killian says she "has turned Pan on his head to spell out NAP, a nap
in which she sees and writes through the creepy children's modernism of
Rossetti, Stein, Sandburg, Harryman, and Freud. This 'panic picnic' is a
fresh, engaging look at the anxiety of a restricted vocabulary --roll over,
Esperanto, and tell Basic English the news." She is a coeditor of the
literary journal Pom2.

Leslie Scalapino is a poet whose books challenge the boundaries of poetry,
prose, and visual art. She is the author of 18 books of poetry, plays, pros=
e
and essays. Her work is characterized by an interest in extreme emotional
states, depictions of human behavior in animalistic terms, outrage at socia=
l
injustice, and an artfully disjointed style in which dashes interrupt
unfinished thoughts. Recent books include Defoe (1995), a novel, and two
collections of writing, Objects in the Terrifying Tense (1993) and Green an=
d
Black / Selected Writings (1996). Books of poems include The Woman Who Coul=
d
Read the Minds of Dogs (1976), Considering how exaggerated music is (1982),
way (1988), which received the American Book Award, and crowd and not
evening light (1992). She is the editor and publisher of O Books.

Anne Tardos is a poet and visual artist. She is the author of the
multilingual performance work Among Men, which was produced by the (WDR)
West German Radio, in Cologne. She has lectured and performed her works
widely in the United States and Europe. Her books of multilingual poems and
graphics are The Dik-dik's Solitude: New and Selected Works (New York:
Granary Books, 2003); A Noisy Nightingale Understands the Tiger's Camouflag=
e
Totally (New York: Belladonna Books, 2003); Uxudo (Berkeley/Oakland: Tuumba
Press/O Books, 1999); Mayg-shem Fish (Elmwood, CT: Potes & Poets Press,
1995); and Cat Licked the Garlic (Vancouver, B.C.: Tsunami Editions, 1992).
Examples of her visual texts were exhibited at the Museum of Modern Art, Ne=
w
York, 1993; the Venice Biennale (Fluxus Pavillion), 1990; Museo d'Arte
Moderna, Bolzano, 1991; the New Museum, New York, 1992; and the Neuberger
Museum of Art, New York, 1999. Examples of her recordings can be heard on
the CDs A Chance Operation: The John Cage Tribute, collaboratively composed
and performed with Jackson Mac Low (New York: Koch International, 1992), an=
d
Open Secrets (New York: Experimental Intermedia XI 110, 1993) and on the
cassettes Songs and Simultaneities, with Mac Low (New York: Tarmac-1, 1981)=
,
and Gatherings (New York: New Wilderness Audiographics 8137A, 1981). She me=
t
Jackson Mac Low in 1975; the two lived and worked together from 1978 until
his death in 2004.

Since Amy Hills moved to Manhattan in June of 2002, (after taking a leave o=
f
absence from an MFA program at Yale), this feisty young southern songwriter
has released three CD=B9s, =B3Things To Say=B2, =B3Amy Hills LIVE=B2, and her most
recent full length studio album =B3Heroine=B2 (June 15 2004). In August of 2004
she was one of the headlining acts at the 20th Anniversary Antifolk Festiva=
l
with shows in Central Park, Tompkins Square Park and the Sidewalk Caf=E9. Fro=
m
January through August 2004 she held the prestigious job of host for the
=B3Antihootennany=B2 at the Sidewalk Caf=E9=8AManhattan=B9s largest and longest
running Open Mic with over 80 acts every Monday night. In March of 2003 she
founded an open mic for songwriters where continues to serve as host to a
standing room only crowd and over 30 performers every Wednesday at DTUT
(Downtown Uptown Caf=E9 Lounge, Upper West Side, Manhattan www.dtut.com). She
is currently in the studio, working with producer Mark Christensen, to
record a new EP featuring both new and previously recorded songs. She is
also performing regularly as a member of the band Hearth, featuring members
of the Moldy Peaches, the Larval Organs, and The Babyskins.
Hailing from the friendly town of Charleston, South Carolina, Amy=B9s music
brings just a touch of her southern charm. Her writing has been compared to
Patty Griffin and Bonnie Raitt, although she would say that her musical
influences are more rock than folk or country. Most live performances
feature her power ballads and a healthy mix of subtle protest songs and
songs about her love life, or lack thereof depending on the month. She is
regarded for ability to play requests on cue including songs on piano and
her rarely seen children=B9s accordian. Her musical comrades and cohorts are
among the best in the business so don=B9t be too surprised if you recognize
faces in the crowd.

The next time you are in Columpital I can show you how to french fold a
book. Being French helps. My French fingers are more adept at folding
parallel to the grain. We invented it you know. We should have never
loaned it to the Aussies. Or the Canadians. If someone says "accordion
like" it should be obvious that this is not very close to the actual.
Accordions are, in time related order, German then Italian then San
Franciscan. I am quite good at it. I play a mean folding tune. French
folds are, in time related orders (although these two are opposing
theorems), South American Indian then French. I do not know why. It
helps tho.

Be well

Hello there, let's REALLY  celebrate the 250th anniversary on November 11th!
! ! !

November 11th, 2005 is the 250th anniversary of Benjamin  Franklin's
statement:

"Those who would give up essential liberty to purchase a little temporary
safety deserve neither liberty nor safety."

Let's remind everyone we know about these words, and let's talk with
strangers at the bus stop, waiting in line for the bathroom at concerts,
restaurants, ball games, traffic court and every other place we find  ourselves.

When talking about this statement, let's also talk about such things as the
Patriot Act, and how they measure against Franklin's words  for preserving
liberty first and foremost.  And please, let's not fool  ourselves about who was
behind the Patriot Act. Here's a reminder of the  role call for Patriot Act
votes:
_http://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?
congress=107&session=1&vote=00313_
(http://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=107&session=1&vote=00313)

When I woke this morning, thinking about the approaching 250th anniversary,
I was thinking about what the United States was like for the 200th
anniversary.

Although Senator Joseph McCarthy was still in office, his powers and his
reign of terror had all but been shut down the year before, and this is of
course a positive celebration for that year.  The end of McCarthy took a  fight,
but it was fought, and won, and best summed up by Edward R. Murrow in  March of
1954 when he stated, "This is no time for men who oppose Senator  McCarthy's
methods to keep silent, or for those who approve."

Let the 250th anniversary of Franklin's statement have as much belt  behind
it!  What do Franklin's words mean to you, today, right  now?

The Foreign Policy Research Institute's 2005 First Annual Benjamin  Franklin
Public Service Award is being given to Henry Kissinger.   HENRY KISSINGER!?
Send a telegram to Cambodia, pronto!  Never mind  the telegram, let's march
over to Franklin's grave (a dozen blocks from my  apartment down here in
Philadelphia)!  We need to TALK ABOUT THIS  with Mr. Franklin himself!

Henry Kissinger is distinguished now with Franklin's name, in the same
breath, at a gold-plated dinner inside Philadelphia's Westin Hotel.   Wow!

Well, frankly, I believe the Ben Franklin Award given recently to Paul
Joannides for his book GUIDE TO GETTING IT ON! is far more appropriate.   Franklin
would more readily approve of a healthy appetite for sexual exploration  than
he would bombing sovereign nations who posed no threat to America.

C'mon, this book is great!  Cosmopolitan Magazine says, "In our vast  library
of sex books, this is by far and away the most human, enlightening and
entertaining read of the lot.  I'll be recommending it until my keyboard  wears
out."  You can easily imagine Franklin sitting in a chair,  nodding along to such
chapters as "Brief History of Sex," "The Importance of  Getting Naked," "The
Glands Down Under," and the lascivious "Nipples,  Nipples, Nipples."  Ooo my,
Mr. Franklin, we know you loved your  life!

Yes, and so did the countless victims of Kissinger love their lives.   Henry
Kissinger is getting an award in Benjamin Franklin's name!  This is
outrageous!  And with the approach of Franklin's 300th birthday every snake  from the
Bush tree will be in town, getting their photographs taken next to  Franklin
statues and printing presses.  While the Patriot Act seeps into  the machinery
our free speech has enjoyed as our right, these bastards who would  deny us our
rights continue to feign themselves the great liberators.

Let's get the celebration of our liberties started, everywhere,  everyway!

I'm forwarding this announcement to the list from poet Paul Nelson:

AmericanSentences.com, a website dedicated to the haiku-esque form created
by Allen Ginsberg, has been launched. A relatively unknown form, Paul Nelson
has taken it upon himself to write at least one of these every day since
2001.

An essay about the form, created for the recent Haiku North America
conference, an excerpt of an interview with Anne Waldman and Andrew
Schelling about the form and samples from the 5 years of practice is
available on the site.

Nessen’s primavera (What he said about Nixon.) and
bottle of Great Wall wine, and thinking Jackson
Pollock and Cool Hand Luke folly juxtaposed against.
And he says, he says to all those folk who mistook
freedom for peace, Palm Sunday cross in hand, he says,
let breath be our license.  And then, his girl tucked
under chin, and he rubs from the arch of her nose to
her eyebrows, occasionally curling the index finger
and pinching gentle its tip. “Am I your sweetness,” he
says, “Am I your sweetness?”

it's  not really a form  don't be fooled i spoke to ginsberg about this
he switched  from calling them american haiku
to american sentences when he felt that what he was writing did not
completely qualify as haiku
 a form kerouac embraced
and hence ginsy followed suit
but hey call em what you like i don't think it was his purpose to
create a new genre
tho he did once say it was good practice to write one haiku a day
i'm all for the short form
tho i rarely  practice it

The Subject Supposed to Loot and Rape
Reality and fantasy in New Orleans
By Slavoj Zizek October 20, 2005

According to a well-known anecdote, anthropologists
studying "primitives" who supposedly held certain superstitious
beliefs (that they descend from a fish or from a bird, for example)
asked them directly whether they "really" believed such things. They
answered: "Of course not--we 're not stupid! But I was told that
some of our ancestors actually did believe that." In short, they
transferred their belief onto another.

We do the same thing with our children by going through the ritual
of Santa Claus. Since our children (are supposed to) believe in him
and we do not want to disappoint them, they pretend to believe so as
not to disappoint us by puncturing our belief in their naivety (and
to get the presents, of course). Isn't this also the usual excuse of
the mythical crooked politician who turns honest? "I cannot
disappoint the ordinary people who believe in me." Furthermore, this
need to find another who "really believes" is also what propels us
to stigmatize the Other as a (religious or ethnic) "fundamentalist."
In an uncanny way, some beliefs always seem to function "at a
distance." In order for the belief to function, there has to be some
ultimate guarantor of it, and yet this guarantor is always deferred,
displaced, never present in persona. The point, of course, is that
this other subject who directly believes does not need to actually
exist for the belief to be operative: It is enough precisely to
presuppose his existence, i.e. to believe in it, either in the guise
of the primitive Other or in the guise of the impersonal "one" ("one
believes...").

The events in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina struck the city
provide a new addition to this series of "subjects supposed to..."--
the subject supposed to loot and rape. We all remember the reports
on the disintegration of public order, the explosion of black
violence, rape and looting. However, later inquiries demonstrated
that, in the large majority of cases, these alleged orgies of
violence did not occur: Non-verified rumors were simply reported as
facts by the media. For example, on September 3, the Superintendent
of the New Orleans Police Department told the New York Times about
conditions at the Convention Center: "The tourists are walking
around there, and as soon as these individuals see them, they 're
being preyed upon. They are beating, they are raping them in the
streets." In an interview just weeks later, he conceded that some of
his most shocking statements turned out to be untrue: "We have no
official reports to document any murder. Not one official report of
rape or sexual assault."

The reality of poor blacks, abandoned and left without means to
survive, was thus transformed into the specter of blacks exploding
violently, of tourists robbed and killed on streets that had slid
into anarchy, of the Superdome ruled by gangs that were raping women
and children. These reports were not merely words, they were words
that had precise material effects: They generated fears that caused
some police officers to quit and led the authorities to change troop
deployments, delay medical evacuations and ground helicopters.
Acadian Ambulance Company, for example, locked down its cars after
word came that armed robbers had looted all of the water from a
firehouse in Covington--a report that proved totally untrue.

Of course, the sense of menace had been ignited by genuine disorder
and violence: Looting, ranging from base thievery to foraging for
the necessities of life, did occur after the storm passed over New
Orleans. However, the (limited) reality of crimes in no way
exonerates "reports" on the total breakdown of law and order--not
because these reports were "exaggerated," but for a much more
radical reason. Jacques Lacan claimed that, even if the patient's
wife is really sleeping around with other men, the patient 's
jealousy is still to be treated as a pathological condition. In a
homologous way, even if rich Jews in early 1930s Germany "really"
had exploited German workers, seduced their daughters and dominated
the popular press, the Nazis ' anti-Semitism would still have been
an emphatically "untrue," pathological ideological condition. Why?
Because the causes of all social antagonisms were projected onto
the "Jew"--an object of perverted love-hatred, a spectral figure of
mixed fascination and disgust.

And exactly the same goes for the looting in New Orleans: Even if
all the reports on violence and rapes had proven to be factually
true, the stories circulating about them would still
be "pathological" and racist, since what motivated these stories
were not facts, but racist prejudices, the satisfaction felt by
those who would be able to say: "You see, Blacks really are like
that, violent barbarians under the thin layer of civilization!" In
other words, we would be dealing with what could be called lying in
the guise of truth: Even if what I am saying is factually true, the
motives that make me say it are false.

Of course, we never openly admit these motives. But from time to
time, they nonetheless pop up in our public space in a censored
form, in the guise of denegation: Once evoked as an option, they are
then immediately discarded. Recall the recent comments by William
Bennett, the compulsive gambler and author of The Book of Virtues,
on his call-in program "Morning in America": "But I do know that
it 's true that if you wanted to reduce crime, you could, if that
were your sole purpose, you could abort every black baby in this
country, and your crime rate would go down. That would be an
impossibly ridiculous and morally reprehensible thing to do, but
your crime rate would go down." The White House spokesman
immediately reacted: "The president believes the comments were not
appropriate." Two days later, Bennett qualified his statement: "I
was putting a hypothetical proposition ... and then said about it,
it was morally reprehensible to recommend abortion of an entire
group of people. But this is what happens when you argue that ends
can justify the means." This is exactly what Freud meant when he
wrote that the Unconscious knows no negation: The official
(Christian, democratic ... ) discourse is accompanied and sustained
by a whole nest of obscene, brutal racist and sexist fantasies,
which can only be admitted in a censored form.

But we are not dealing here only with good old racism. Something
more is at stake, a fundamental feature of the emerging "global"
society. On September 11, 2001, the Twin Towers were hit. Twelve
years earlier, on November 9, 1989, the Berlin Wall fell. November 9
announced the "happy '90s," the Francis Fukuyama dream of the "end
of history": the belief that liberal democracy had, in principle,
won, that the search is over, that the advent of a global, liberal
world community lurks just around the corner, that the obstacles to
this ultra-Hollywood happy ending are merely empirical and
contingent (local pockets of resistance where the leaders did not
yet grasp that their time is over). In contrast, 9/11 is the main
symbol of the end of the Clintonite happy '90s, of the forthcoming
era in which new walls are emerging everywhere, between Israel and
the West Bank, around the European Union, on the U.S.-Mexico border.
The rise of the populist New Right is just the most prominent
example of the urge to raise new walls.

A couple of years ago, an ominous decision of the European Union
passed almost unnoticed: a plan to establish an all-European border
police force to secure the isolation of the Union territory, so as
to prevent the influx of the immigrants. This is the truth of
globalization: the construction of new walls safeguarding the
prosperous Europe from a flood of immigrants. One is tempted to
resuscitate here the old Marxist "humanist" opposition of "relations
between things" and "relations between persons": In the much
celebrated free circulation opened up by the global capitalism, it
is "things" (commodities) which freely circulate, while the
circulation of "persons" is more and more controlled. We are thus
not dealing with "globalization as an unfinished project," but with
a true "dialectics of globalization." The segregation of the people
is the reality of economic globalization. This new racism of the
developed world is in a way much more brutal than the previous one:
Its implicit legitimization is neither naturalist (the "natural"
superiority of the developed West) nor culturalist (we in the West
also want to preserve our cultural identity). Rather, it 's an
unabashed economic egotism--the fundamental divide is the one
between those included into the sphere of (relative) economic
prosperity and those excluded from it.

In the beginning of October 2005, the Spanish police, who have dealt
with the problem of desperate African migrants trying to penetrate
the small Spanish territory across Gibraltar with lethal force,
displayed their plans to build a wall between the Spanish and
Moroccan border. The images presented--a complex structure with all
the latest electronic equipment--bore an uncanny resemblance to
those of the Berlin Wall, only with the opposite motive, designed to
prevent people from coming in, not getting out. The cruel irony is
that it is the government of Zapatero, arguably the most anti-racist
and tolerant in Europe, that is forced to adopt these measures of
segregation--a clear sign of the limits of the
multiculturalist "tolerant" approach which preaches open borders and
acceptance of Others. It is thus becoming clear that the solution is
not "tear down the walls and let them all in," the easy, empty
demand often put forth by soft-hearted liberal "radicals." Rather,
the real solution is to tear down the true wall, not the police one,
but the social-economic one: To change society so that people will
no longer desperately try to escape their own world.

This brings us back to rumours and "reports" about "subjects
supposed to loot and rape:" New Orleans is one of those cities
within the United States most heavily marked by the internal wall
that separates the affluent from ghettoized blacks. And it is about
those on the other side of the wall that we fantasize: More and
more, they live in another world, in a blank zone that offers itself
as a screen for the projection of our fears, anxieties and secret
desires. The "subject supposed to loot and rape" is on the other
side of the Wall--this is the subject about whom Bennett can afford
to make his slips of the tongue and confess in a censored mode his
murderous dreams. More than anything else, the rumors and fake
reports from the aftermath of Katrina bear witness to the deep class
division of American society.

Well, not exactly, or maybe . . . Here's a few things written about French=

is the name for a printing technique used on a broadside folded piece. True=

commonly used for invitations.

2. french-fold: Pages joined at the fore-edge and printed on the outer side=

only, also accordion fold.

3. A sheet of paper printed on one side only and folded over from left and=

4. French fold =96 A press sheet in which all of the pages are printed on=

page signature. The blank side is folded inward before the other folds are=

MFA WRITING PROGRAM DIRECTOR

The MFA Writing Program at the California Institute of the Arts seeks a
Director. Now twelve years old and at a stable enrollment of
approximately forty-five students, the program is known for its
unconventional (non-tracking) curriculum that encourages writing across
genres and media and a creative practice informed by critical
perspectives. It is housed in the School of Critical Studies, which is
responsible for the liberal arts education of CalArts undergraduates
pursuing BFAs in Film, Dance, Music, Art and Theater. Core MFA faculty
also teach undergraduate Critical Studies classes and MFA writing
students serve as teaching assistants to the Critical Studies faculty at
large. CalArts is a private, accredited visual and performing arts
college located in Valencia, California, serving a community of
approximately 1,300 undergraduate and graduate students and is committed
to fostering a diverse artistic/educational environment.

The ideal candidate will have leadership skills, strong teaching and
publication record and a wide range of contacts in a number of
contemporary writing fields. Her or his vision should capitalize upon
the experimental, interdisciplinary nature of the program and its
history of cooperation with other schools within the Institute. In
addition to overseeing the daily operation of the program -- supervising
admissions, teaching assistantships, financial aid, curriculum and
hiring decisions -- the Director will teach and act as a public
spokesperson for the program. At this juncture, the program also seeks
strong advocacy and active fundraising for student scholarships, faculty
development, and other resources.

Send a letter of interest, CV, names of three referees and a short
writing sample (maximum 20 pages) to Dean, School of Critical Studies,
Attn: MFA Writing Director Search, 24700 McBean Parkway, Valencia, CA
91355. Application deadline is November 24, 2005. EOE.

Here is a non-technical anecdote in relation to French folds. Individual=20
poetry books in Turkey, traditionally, are published in French folds. About=20=
thirty=20
years ago, I was in he Turkish poet Edip Sansever's house, which overlooked=20
the Bosphorus. His wall was covered with books. As I was looking through the=
m,=20
he told me that years ago a poet friend of his had given him a copy of one o=
f=20
his books. About a year after, when the same friend was at his home looking=20
through the shelves, he noticed that his book was there with its pages uncut=
.=20
Since then, Edip Cansever told me, he makes sure that the pages of the books=
 his=20
friends give him are cut before he puts them on the shelf.

Ciao,

Murat

I am doing research on how people identify and differentiate the art (or
aesthetic) communities of which they are a member.  I was hoping that
members of the list could aid in this research by answering a few questions.
  I am a poet and a philosophy graduate student at Temple University.  Thank
you in advance for your answers.  (Also, if you want, feel free to answer
the questions that most apply to you or that you find most interesting.)

(1) How would you define the term ‘arts community’?
(2) Do you see yourself as a member of a particular arts community (or
communities)?  If so, which community (or communities)?
(3) Do you think that it is possible to belong to more than one arts
community?  Why?
(4) What positive benefits do you think an arts community provides?
(5) Where do you go to figure out what sort of art (broadly construed) you
should see?  (For example, when I want to know what movie I should see next
I ask my mom; when I want to know what art show I should see in New York I
first look at the websites of the major museums, then the New York Times,
then blogs, etc.)

Thank you so much for your help,
My research would not be possible without it,
I look forward to hearing from you,

Francis

Miekal, I don't know if it is "ornamental", or if that would be the word I
would use (or if Charles did?). I always find the air, and not fully visible
blankness of the non-printed side to be disconcerting (a "concertina" that
cannot be opened??!!). The instability of the ventilated folds - the way the
paper slightly balloons out - makes me pay closer attention to the text, as
if its very body may slip down and off the the slope of the paper!

But, excuse me if I don't back up to Charles' great sense of definition,
isn't a "French fold" when applied to a conventional book binding, also
called a "virgin binding" - once so typical when you bought a book from a
French publishing house. I remember spending lots of time - knife or
envelope opener - slicing what often seemed an endless series of folds in
order to read both sides of the pages in a novel or book of poems. Done
well, the slicing creates a decaled edge. Done badly a bad tear into the
margins! I remember getting an Henri Michaux title on his experiments with
mescaline, madly slicing the folds, while approaching tendonitis of the
wrist - all in order to get to the full dope, or account of the dope!

Remembering actual, tangible books! Thank goodness, Charles keeps his hand
in there!

Thanks for the vote of confidence, Stephen. And for the initial questions,
Miekal.

What Stephen describes as a "virgin binding" has probably been called a
French fold, too, and I have no problem with that, although it's not quite
what I think of when I hear "French fold."

I have not used the traditional French fold in a book, with blankness on
the never-to-be-cut inside paper. I can imagine it done so that the
aesthetics match or complement the content, a kind of graceful size
(thickness) of book created, that might be called for, for the appropriate
text, otherwise impossible with printing on every side of every sheet & all
page panels visible. In other words, I can imagine it used where it seems
appropriate, of an aesthetic (or poetic) piece with the whole, so not
"ornamental" in the sense of "merely ornamental." I think I've seen it done
that way, but I don't have specific memories of such, from years ago when I
worked in a rare book library.

The one time I remember using such a fold, I did rather the opposite of
"printing only on the outside of the sheet," printing on one sheet that was
sewn into paper covers, in a way so that it was possible to unfold that
sheet and only the inside had the printed poems -- hoping to achieve a kind
of participatory act on the part of the reader, unfolding to the desired
end (which was a sheet where all the written work was visible at once), in
a way that was revelatory, and not "ornamental." We did, in that case, end
up printing a drawing on the "outside" of the sheet, though, so it was not
left completely blank. Such acts of course complicate definitions such as
"French fold" as I think a lot of contemporary book artists or book makers
take traditional techniques but turn them in some way toward their own use.

Alison's Festival Diary #6

Good Samaritans, written and directed by Richard Maxwell, New York City
Players at the Malthouse. Berggasse 19 - The Apartments of Sigmund Freud ,
written and designed by Brian Lipson, directed by Susie Dee,  Grant Street
Theatre.

Over the past three weeks, Melbourne's self-designation as Australia's
"cultural capital" has felt like more than an advertising slogan.  It's had
the air of a mini-metropolis: interesting things have been going on, and
people have been discussing them with passion and vim and, sometimes,
vehement disagreement.

Hey, something was happening here.  And Melburnians were interested: all the
theatres were packed, the queues outside the Art Centre stretched past the
gallery, and the Arts Centre forecourt spilled over with people eating and
drinking.  Even the drab environs of the Flinders St Station concourse was
infested with culture vultures.

More than a few people I've spoken to have dubbed this festival the best
yet.  I'm with them on that.  Bouquets to MIAF Artistic Director Kristy
Edmunds for putting together a program of such depth and range.  Now I'm
wondering if the excitement the festival generated will have knock-on
effects.  There is already a sense that Melbourne's theatre scene is
shifting, with a lively, less parochial and increasingly confident
independent theatre scene underlined by the massive changes at the
Malthouse, which are attracting a younger and bigger audiences.  It could be
that Dame Culture is emerging from her long and disenchanted sleep.  Fingers
crossed.

But to the report on my final week of MIAF, which gave me two experiences
which were at opposite ends of the theatrical spectrum: they couldn't have
been more different in aesthetic, philosophy or performance. And yet both of
them left me with that indefinable lightness of being that I associate with
excellent theatre: a sense that I have been prickled alive.

First person accounts of personal experience are often the most difficult p=
ieces for a
writer to create and an editor to evaluate. But like any other piece of wri=
ting, they can
be evaluated by certain standards of craft as well as by what audiences mig=
ht find
them compelling. This course will focus on both the craft of writing effect=
ive essays and
the practice of identifying likely markets and tailoring content for an aud=
ience. The
instructor will use examples of effective essays and share some of his expe=
riences in
writing and publishing.

Paul Beston is a contributor to The American Spectator whose writing has ap=
peared in
The Wall Street Journal, The Christian Science Monitor, The New York Sun, a=
nd The
Washington Times, and in the anthology Da Capo Best Music Writing 2003 . He=

Dear poetics list friends:

I'm very pleased to announce this year's Fellow in Poetics & Poetic
Practice at the Center for Programs in Contemporary Writing, University of
Pennsylvania. She is ERICA HUNT.

Erica is a widely-admired poet, based in New York, where she is also
President of the Twenty-First Century Foundation, which gives grants to
organizations that address root causes of social injustice affecting the
Black community. We are very lucky to have her join Penn's writing
community next semester. She will teach a seminar called ""Words into
Sound: an Exploration of Poetry and Jazz/New Music."

For more about CPCW's Fellows in Poetics & Poetic Practice, see
	
	http://writing.upenn.edu/poeticsfellow.html

Best wishes,

Al Filreis
Kelly Professor of English
Faculty Director, the Kelly Writers House
Director, the Center for Programs in Contemporary Writing
University of Pennsylvania
writing.upenn.edu


PROFILE OF ERICA HUNT
---------------------
Erica Hunt works at the forefront of experimental poetry and poetics,
critical race theory, and feminist aesthetics. She has written three books
of poetry: Arcade, with artist Alison Saar, Piece Logic, and Local History
(Roof Books, 1993). Her published and forthcoming essays include "Notes for
an Oppositional Poetics" (The Politics of Poetic Form,, ed. Charles
Bernstein), "Parabolay" (Boundary 2), and "Roots of the Black Avant Garde"
(Tripwire, forthcoming). Hunt's poems can be found in Moving Borders: Three
Decades of Innovative Writing by Women (ed. Mary Margaret Sloan), Iowa
Poetry Review, and the Virago Anthology of Women's Love Poetry. Hunt has
also worked as a housing organizer, radio producer, poetry teacher, and
program officer for a social justice campaign.

DESCRIPTION OF THE WRITING COURSE ERICA HUNT WILL TEACH:
--------------------------------------------------------
"Words into Sound: an Exploration of Poetry and Jazz/New Music" examines
poetic composition and collaboration through several lens:  historical,
cultural and structural frames.  Music, often thought too abstract for
words, escapes the lyric trap to meet words as elements of composition,
inseparable from the form.  Class will listen and write/score, using words
to chisel, count time, pattern and give texture, not as accompaniment, but
as a voicing of the moment of performance.  The historical range--from the
post war Bebops and Beats to the Black Arts movement to the
performance/spoken word pulse of today.  We'll look/listen to Langston
Hughes, Babs Gonzalez, Tom Waits, Lord Buckley, Amiri Baraka, George Lewis,
Nate Mackey, Ann Waldman, Tracie Morris and Sekous Sundiata and others who
have collaborated to create poetry/music compositions that explore language
terrain with complexity and insight.

WHAT IS THE CPCW FELLOW IN POETICS & POETIC PRACTICE?
-----------------------------------------------------
The Center for Programs in Contemporary Writing Fellow in Poetics & Poetic
Practice is appointed for the fall semester of each academic year. He or
she will teach an undergraduate seminar that integrates creative writing
and poetics, and will serve as a mentor for the students in this class. He
or she will join the community of writers, critics and friends of
contemporary writing that forms around the Kelly Writers House and Center
for Programs in Contemporary Writing, participating in workshops, giving
readings, talks and presentations. The purpose of the Fellows in Poetics &
Poetic Practice project is to deepen connections young writers at Penn can
make with writers of richly heterodox poetic practice whose work tends not
to fit neatly into academic categories. It is expected that the Fellow will
make lasting connections with the faculty and students in the Penn writing
communities.
	The Fellow in Poetics & Poetic Practice will receive a modest
stipend and will have access to funds for creating programs and projects.
Insofar as CPCW is an innovation factory or skunk works for new ideas and
venturesome projects in contemporary writing, the Fellows in Poetics will
help further this enterprise.

Granary Books announces the publication of The Purification of Fagus
sylvatica var penula by Paul Etienne Lincoln.

The Purification of Fagus sylvatica var pendula is emblematic of
Lincoln's inquiry into the origin and production of memory - and our
ethereal relationship to that intangible evidence of our consciousness.
In this pursuit Lincoln has employed diverse forms and themes, ranging
from examination of historical figures to detailing anything from New
York City infrastructure to "household" machines that dispense
gin-and-tonics (mixed at varying strengths). Comprised of photographs,
diagrams, and text, The Purification records the series of experiments
and performance which detail the afterlife of a specimen of local
vegetation. The book begins, "Situated at the perimeter of Weeping
Beach Tree Park in Queens, New York, was a small pavilion looking on to
a stump of the oldest Weeping Beach in America. In 1847 Samuel Bowne
Parsons, a Quaker and a nurseryman purchased a shoot of Weeping Beach,
Fagus sylvatica var pendula, in Belgium while traveling in search of
unusual plants. On his return to the United States he planted the shoot
at the site of the stump, then part of Parson's Nurseries. Every
Weeping Beach in America is descended from this one tree. Regrettably,
the stump is all that remains, as shortly after this venerable tree's
150th anniversary in 1997 it died and was cut down. The tree had,
however spawned seven progeny, which still grow in a circle around the
original beech."

Over the past two decades, Lincoln has committed himself to creating
complex installations, recordings, and documentation on a wide range of
subject matter. The Purification follows Lincoln's investigation of the
Weeping Beech as a way of detailing and process of examination and
history writing which is ever shifting and defining the world around
us.

Is this serious?

"unique tribal representation of poetry of the Western Hemisphere"

The people who lived in the Western Hemisphere before contact with Europeans
were not anymore "tribal" than the Franks, Germans, Lombards, Romans or
Chinese were in 1492.

The Incas were not tribal, the Aztecs were not 'Tribal' the Mound Builders
were not 'Tribal' and the Guarani were not 'tribal' they were fully formed
advanced societies. Whoever wrote this has turned the many cultures of this
hemisphere into objects not people.

What makes America, all of it from Alaska to Argentina America is that we
are all mixed race...

Wait, Mr. Bianchi, if Eric Dickey, presumably a Native
American, wants to speak of the "tribal" peoples of
the Americas, why not just let him use the word?  This
sounds like a curious Reverse Political Correctness,
wherein you're telling a representative of a
beleagured group of people not to use the word he
finds appropriate (as opposed to the usual thing, of
the representative or advocate of the beleagured group
saying, how dare you use such, such, such a word or
metaphor, or appropriate our culture in your writings,
which censoriousness indeed sometimes or fairly often
goes too far, but makes more sense than the reverse
thing you're doing).

What's so wrong with the "tribal" label, though it may
not apply so well to certain groups like the Aztecs or
Incas?  I don't think it confines a group to
"objecthood".

And as to the reply of Dalachinsky, c'mon, man, you
know that you (and I) cannot call ourselves indigenous
in the same way as members of the tribal peoples!

This whole argument about indigenous is fallacious no group has been in once
place for their entire history
Groups move- groups grow and change and to place a time limit on who is
beleaguered and who is 'tribal' is the kind of
weak thinking that substitutes real questioning and real art for political
correctness.

Why are Cherokees indigenous and Arabs or Greeks or Dravidians not?

I want someone to tell me what the Inuit have in common with the Aymara or
Quechua except for the fact that they both live on the American continent?
Can you imagine an anthology of poetry that calls for indigenous writers
from the Eurasian continent?

Imagine if the post said this...

"Aboriginal Eurasian and surrounding island poets are welcome to submit work
to be included in this unique tribal representation of poetry of the Eastern
Hemisphere."

It does except for changing one word-

Mr Baraban don't use "how dare you" with me I have put my money where my
mouth is in the quest for social justice and I have dear friends who are
Aymara, Quechua and Guarani in Brazil, Bolivia and Peru and they are members
of Nations not tribes.

Wait, Mr. Bianchi, if Eric Dickey, presumably a Native American, wants to
speak of the "tribal" peoples of the Americas, why not just let him use the
word?  This sounds like a curious Reverse Political Correctness, wherein
you're telling a representative of a beleagured group of people not to use
the word he finds appropriate (as opposed to the usual thing, of the
representative or advocate of the beleagured group saying, how dare you use
such, such, such a word or metaphor, or appropriate our culture in your
writings, which censoriousness indeed sometimes or fairly often goes too
far, but makes more sense than the reverse thing you're doing).

What's so wrong with the "tribal" label, though it may not apply so well to
certain groups like the Aztecs or Incas?  I don't think it confines a group
to "objecthood".

And as to the reply of Dalachinsky, c'mon, man, you know that you (and I)
cannot call ourselves indigenous
in the same way as members of the tribal peoples!

The term "tribe" as used for Native American people
is a USA holdover. It has not been used in Canada for
a long time.

Haas Bianchi,

The tone I was trying to maintain in my comment was
that of my opening: "...why not just let him use the
word?"  If I strayed from that, and I imagine I did, I
am sorry.  I wasn't trying to say "how dare you" TO
you, though I used the phrase in a discussion about
how they discussions tend to go. But. wow, it's hard
not to sound harsh in these discussions.

I just didn't hear anything so wrong in the enterprise
of "resistance,  reclamation, and renaissance" the
announcement speaks of, nor, again, in the word
"tribe"--no reason in my opinion to say "is this
serious?" as you did. I'd like to read this issue when
it comes out, and I wish Allison Adelle Hedge Coke
every success in putting it together.

pc poetry, huh?

One word, more than any other, further defines  indigenous, native, tribal:

EXTINCTION

or near extinction, the attempt to extinct . . .

An online & print journal dedicated to innovation & collaboration,
Sidebrow provides a forum for exploring the collective & the singular in
the literary arts. By taking an open-ended approach to its construction,
Sidebrow expands on the traditional literary journal model, showcasing
communally derived literary pieces alongside individual works.

Sidebrow evaluates submissions both as stand-alone set pieces & as
points of departure for collaboration with editors & fellow
contributors. Writers whose submissions resonate with other pieces under
evaluation will be contacted to participate in communal constructions
based on their work. To open the assembly of each issue of Sidebrow ,
editors will post pieces periodically in hopes of stirring creative
response. Submissions that reimagine, depart from, or explore the
interstices between posted pieces are highly encouraged. As a way of
stimulating such submissions, editors will annotate potential fodder for
response for most posted pieces. And, as each issue evolves, editors
will also post calls for submissions based on predefined constraints.
Check back periodically for potential parameters to incorporate in your
work, or send your email address to constraint (at) sidebrow (dot) net
to receive updates.

Sidebrow seeks fiction, poetry, art, essay, ephemera, found text,
academic inquiries into mathematics, economics, & the sciences,
political analysis, and literary, cultural, & art critique. In short,
engaging material regardless of ilk. Given its desire to unlock what is
common to disparate literary, artistic, & cultural pursuits, Sidebrow
encourages the submission of both partial excerpts and fully formed works.

Queries and all other correspondence should be sent to sidebrow (at)
sidebrow (dot) net.

I think this was a tone issue.. please I hope that you were not offended by my tone and I dont wish to be negative I support what they are doing it is just that during the three years that I worked with people from the Andes I heard at length about how much they hated the word Tribe and insisted that there cities were bigger than Europe's cities and I guess their concern became mine- so no harm no foul

Everybody moves on eventually
African Writers Abroad are currently accepting memoir submissions from
women of African descent for our forthcoming anthology on the theme of
moving.
Moving is something that most of us have had to do at some time. Whether
changing countries, cities or even streets the experience can be an
emotional one. Fear, excitement, joy, hope are just some of the
sensations that you may have felt when you had to move. African Writers
Abroad are looking for poignant memoir pieces about moving.
Why did you move? How far did you go? How did moving make you feel? What
did you leave behind? What did you hope to find - and did you find it?
This anthology will reflect a broad range of voices, viewpoints and
experiences. Whether you have moved once, twice or several times we want
to read your stories of real life experiences and journal /diary entries
Guidelines for submissions:
- 2,000 words maximum 3,500 words double-spaced.
- Please submit by email attachment in Microsoft Word, Arial, 12 point font.
- Deadline for submissions: 30 November 2005
Please send submissions as an attachment to
africanwritersabroad @yahoo.com
Please c.c. your submission to Andrea Enisuoh on enisuoh@aol.com
Andrea Enisuoh is a writer and journalist. She writes the Arts page for
New Nation newspaper and is editor of Artvibes.org

if no "real money" was spent in the creation, production, and  distribution
of art, and if no one  was an artist by profession, this would  be a fine idea,
i suppose.

No one is ever going to pay the bills by doing what we do (or don't, as som=
e might argue). Breaking even is the best we can hope for. Those brilliant =
enough to score free money via grants and prizes, good for them, but it's a=
 slim chance.

So we can either all become great at what we do or do it for each other, fo=
r the people, without consequence of being taxed.

Say all you want about the toil, the work, the hardships of composing. In m=
y opinion I see it nothing more than a lifestyle. Not a career. Career writ=
ers are paid to follow formulas, sell books. Lifestyle writers do it becaus=
e it's just.=20

Are we going to argue? Let's then. In my opinion work pays for itself. Work=
 done should be enough to get other works. Trades are important. Before the=
re was money there were goods.

Take Furniture Press for example, we do make money but it all goes back to =
making more books. More money=3Dmore books=3DChris still in the poorhouse. =
Am I going to give up the gig because it's not making me cash? Take a wild =
friggin' guess.=20

I hope to break the bank, no, I hope that Furniture Press will go the way o=
f the traders, I demand it, and I will soon let it be a trade only market.=
=20

By next spring look for Furniture Press books to be 'by trade only' book fo=
r book. Or cash, whatever you want to send us.

Oh gosh, then we have a problem: Is your trade fair? Is your trade worth my=
 trade? We have a real dilemma here!

Give Me Shelter!

Due to Wilma, Michael is stranded in Hollywood, Florida, with no electricity.
Among other inconviniences (and he has had his share this year), he will not
be able to access his e-mail for the next few weeks. He would like the Poetics
List to suspend all the posts to his e-mail address until further notice.

Dear friends:

I would like to invite you to examine, evaluate and hopefully join The
New Poetry Review (NPR), an online poetry workshop, located at:

http://www.newpoetryreview.com <http://www.newpoetryreview.com/>

The centerpiece of the site is our forum, which can be accessed by
clicking on Forum in the top menu or else indirectly by clicking on:

http://www.newpoetryreview.com/forum

While membership is free, it is not automatic. Of course, we hope that
you will consider applying for membership in NPR. This is done by
clicking on Register at the top of our forum home page. We would
appreciate it if you could send us a sample of your work, either as a
poet or critic (5 poems max and/or one critical essay). Or send us a URL
to any publications online. If you qualify (and we expect that you will
be), your registration will be activated. Of course, before you take
this step, we do urge you to explore the site, especially the forum, to
be sure that NPR is right for you.

New Poetry Review is a little over a year old. We have road-tested it
during this preliminary, probational period. We currently have under 15
members but we hope to reach out to the poetic community and add many
more qualified members.

The main focus of our workshop is a discussion of each poem in depth, as
captured in our subheading: "One Poem at a Time". While we strongly
favor New Criticism, which would seem rather understandable for a site
that concentrates on "one poem at a time", other critical approaches are
welcome. Essentially, we tend to assume that any other approach, e.g.
historical, biographical, psychological, socio-political, archetypal,
etc. be based on an understanding of the poem as a poem. Thus, while
poetic technique is central to an understanding of a poem, it may be
only a springboard for a larger appreciation. However, we would like
every discussion to focus on the poem in question as its centerpiece.

In view of the serious problem of copyright, we have added special
"Private" forums for each of the forum's main sections, e.g. NPR Poems
-- Public and NPR Poem -- Private. These private forums are NOT visible
to any outsider. You will see them only after you become a members.
These private forums will allow you to post poems that you wish to see
critiqued without actual publication.

For full details about NPR, please see the Guide to Newcomers under
Administrator's Corner on the forum home page.

Below is a brief summary of what NPR is and what our objectives are.


What is NPR?

Reading poetry is like digging a tunnel. The reader and the writer both

share the responsibility of meeting each other half way. The writer must

write greatly, and the reader must read greatly. Otherwise, there is no

true communication.


In my opinion, the most important and most valuable service those who

are experienced in the reading of poetry can do for others is to help them

appreciate poetry as a unique art form, that is, as something more than

mere linguistic proficiency and cultural significance. All of that is a

foundation for poetry, and no poem can come into being, consciously or

otherwise, without being nurtured by it. Yet, poetry makes special

technical as well as intellectual and emotional demands that are unique to

it. Without the language, there can be no craft, and without the craft,
there

can be no art. I would like to see NPR as a forum where poets give and

receive in a spirit of mutual respect and appreciation.


In my role as Administrator, I try to insure that only qualified people
join the

forum. Everyone, from beginners to experienced poets, is welcome. All that

is required is some proof of a poetic sensibility and a desire to learn and

share, Like any forum, NPR cannot survive without DIVERSITY. Poets and
critics

of every stripe and color, of every style and point of view, are
welcome. There

is room for every kind of discussion and every kind of literary style
from the

analytical to the impressionistic to the dramatic to the aphoristic to the

lyrical or whatever is right for you. On the other hand, in my role as a
member

of NPR, I am just another member and carry no more nor less weight than any

other member. You will notice that I personally tend towards the analytical

approach, but this need not be so for others. Let each discuss poetry in
their

own style. Let each member gain what they can from everyone else. If
there is

no diversity, we will gain nothing but an echo of ourselves, and nobody
wants

that. I certainly do not.


Yet, in the final analysis, all that really matters are the poems and our

experience and appreciative understanding of them. Hopefully this forum

will help us share this understanding among discerning poets, readers and

critics. And we will engage with each poem on its own merits, one poem at

a time.


As the founder of this forum, I see my own role as a kind of matchmaker,

if you will, helping to bring together poets and critics of quality in an

atmosphere of high expectations and fruitful interaction.

THROES


The crack of a whip sublimated to echo

offers no oasis or solace,
no relief from a smolder that scorches the charred,
living under master-slave despotism,
the innards of an abdomen public property,

town square pulled off-center by a cadaver
left unburied, died twice for the crime of
bringing comfort to corpses died threefold,

a flock of birds detonated by a scowl.
Frenzied gestures frozen to a tableau,
a dog starved into a fanged carnivore,
plaintive lamentation memorized,—

lesser developed countries on the map
feed tributaries into the green ocean,

marcescent, withering but not falling off.
The conversion rate between currencies
balances maelstrom against undertow.
A hieroglyph of limbs made to express
turmoil, dilated as still as a lake in hell,
famished to the point of devouring star light,—

pallbearers rehearsed woeful threnodies
by imitating a slight gasp.

You know how sometimes you open a book of poetry at random and the poem you
open to is the one you need at that moment? I did this twice today, and each
time the poem was right on. I just wanted to share them:


To Enter That Rhythm Where The Self Is Lost

To enter that rhythm where the self is lost,
where breathing : heartbeat : and the subtle music
of their relation make our dance, and hasten
us to the moment when all things become
magic, another possibility.
That blind moment, midnight, when all sight
begins, and the dance itself is all our breath,
and we ourselves the moment of life and death.
Blinded;     but given now another saving,
the self as vision, at all times perceiving,
all arts all senses being languages,
delivered of will, being transformed in truth -
for life's sake surrendering moment and images,
writing the poem;     in love making;     bringing to birth.

-Muriel Ruykeiser

///

All That Time

I saw two trees embracing.
One leaned on the other
as if to throw her down.
But she was the upright one.
Since their twin youth, maybe she
had been pulling him toward her
all that time,

and finally almost uprooted him.
He was the thin, dry, insecure one,
the most wind-warped, you could see.
And where their tops tangled
it looked like he was crying
on her shoulder.
On the other hand, maybe he

had been trying to weaken her,
break her, or at least
make her bend
over backwards for him
just a little bit.
And all that time
she was standing up to him

the best she could.
She was the most stubborn,
the straightest one, that's a fact.
But he had been willing
to change himself-
even if it was for the worse-
all that time.

At the top they looked like one
tree, where they were embracing.
It was plain they'd be
always together.
Too late now to part.
When the wind blew, you could hear
them rubbing on each other.

Jeffrey - thank you!
I've just completed teaching Rukeyser for a course - and I taught
Swenson last semester!  Those two are poets I can almost always just
open at random to find, as you say, just what I need.
Best,
Charlotte

All That Time

I saw two trees embracing.
One leaned on the other
as if to throw her down.
But she was the upright one.
Since their twin youth, maybe she
had been pulling him toward her
all that time,

and finally almost uprooted him.
He was the thin, dry, insecure one,
the most wind-warped, you could see.
And where their tops tangled
it looked like he was crying
on her shoulder.
On the other hand, maybe he

had been trying to weaken her,
break her, or at least
make her bend
over backwards for him
just a little bit.
And all that time
she was standing up to him

the best she could.
She was the most stubborn,
the straightest one, that's a fact.
But he had been willing
to change himself-
even if it was for the worse-
all that time.

At the top they looked like one
tree, where they were embracing.
It was plain they'd be
always together.
Too late now to part.
When the wind blew, you could hear
them rubbing on each other.

Dear Friends:

Rattapallax magazine is shifting from CDs to DVDs for
the spring 2006 issue (April 2006). We are including
short films based on poetic and literary content with
the magazine.

Cinema has become the people's art. With the advent of
digital technology, filmmaking has become accessible
to everyone. In this year's Tribeca Film Festival,
over 50% of the films were made with digital cameras
and 85% were edited on a computer. By merging poetry &
literature with cinema, we can greatly advance the art
form.

http://www.rattapallax.com/dvds.htm

Some of the film-makers included in the DVD are Abbas
Kiarostami (won the Palme d’Or at Cannes Film Festival
for Taste of Cherry); Daniel Mitelpunkt; Rob Epstein
and Jeffrey Friedman (received two Academy Awards);
Tonya Hurley; and films on Joyce Carol Oates, Yusef
Komunyakaa, Martín Espada and selections from the 2004
Zebra Film Awards.

Cheers
Ram Devineni

MAD SCIENCE IN IMPERIAL CITY
by Shanxing Wang

(selected for publication by Edwin Torres, Kristin Prevallet, Heather=20
Ramsdell & Dan Machlin)


Thursday, November 3, 2005
7:00 P.M., FREE

Teachers & Writers Collaborative
5 Union Square West, 7th Floor
(between 14th and 15th Streets)
212-691-6590

with readings by Shanxing Wang and Special Guests
& Wine and cheese reception.

Directions: 4,5,6,L,N,R to Union Square, F to 14th Street.

Shanxing Wang=92s Mad Science in Imperial City is a work of genius. It =
is=20
intended to be so, and it is saturated with the melancholy and exhibits=20=

something of the fear that genius in its machinations may produce. The=20=

book is also comic, sometimes desperately and more often happily so;=20
the forces of genius are multiple. Comprised of four interrelated=20
works=97which might also be termed chapters or perhaps sections of a=20
serial poem=97this book escapes characterization; escape, in fact, is =
one=20
of its motifs. But it is an escape carried out paradoxically through=20
invasion=97it finds ways out by finding ways in. The work lays out for=20=

itself multiple trajectories, including some provided by math,=20
mechanics, phantasy, music, film, and above all by dreams (or are they=20=

nightmares?) of life in and out of a plan. Culture shapes itself to=20
grids; or, perhaps, gridding and cultural production are the same=20
thing. Shanxing Wang=92s Mad Science in Imperial City proceeds through=20=

involutions and across equations to create an astonishingly original=20
counter to the catastrophe of the contemporary world. This is a=20
brilliant book.
=97Lyn Hejinian

Mad Science in Imperial City is humbling, beautifully mapped and=20
calibrated, wild with imagination, wit, irony. I think it is one of the=20=

most naturally brilliant books I have read of late. Shanxing Wang=20
brings his engineering genius to his genius for a new magical/radical=20
language. Many bows in my old mandarin robe to this impressive debut=20
collection.
=97Anne Waldman

Mad Science in Imperial City is propelled by the personal loss and=20
trauma Shanxing Wang experienced during the political turbulence of the=20=

1980s which culminated in the 1989 tragedy at Tiananmen Square. =46rom=20=

this personal experience, Wang has created a work of art-in-language=20
which breaks new territories of poetic form. The central urgency of=20
Wang's work is a fractured personal and ideological loss; mirroring=20
this, the work manufactures its own form on the page as a broken=20
narrative. Like Dictee by Theresa Hak Kyung Cha, Wang's work=20
materializes the shattered effects of cultural history on the mind of=20
the poet who is trying to piece his life together in its devastating=20
and unresolved wake.
=97Kristin Prevallet


Shanxing Wang was born in Jinzhong, Shanxi Province, China, and studied=20=

Mechanical Engineering at Xi'an Jiaotong University. In 1991, at the=20
age of 26, he moved to the U.S. to pursue a PhD in Mechanical=20

The Non-Profit & The Autonomous Grassroots
by Eric Tang
from Left Turn Magazine

Once upon a time, being labeled an affiliate of the state was a nasty
indictment
in radical movements. Today some of the movement's best and brightest
openly and
proudly claim membership in organizations whose link to the
state-either through
direct public funding or mere tax-reporting-are unambiguous and
well-documented.
I am speaking of the impressive number of radical-minded grassroots
groups that,
while continuing to sincerely abide by the ethos of "our movement,"
have assumed
the form of a Non-Profit (NP) entity.

Non-profits, also known as non-governmental organizations (NGO), are
often
stripped down to their barest and most essential nature as an IRS tax
category:
the 501(c)3. This official registration with the government grants the
accreditation needed to receive government funding and funds through
private
philanthropic foundations. In exchange, the grassroots non-profit must
adopt
legally binding by-laws, elect a board of directors modeled after
corporations,
and open board minutes and fiscal accounting to the public. Previously
considered anathema to the grassroots Left, these practices are accepted
governing principles of many community organizations. While we have yet
to
precisely assess the effects of incorporating an autonomous movement,
experience
suggests the non-profit poses as many challenges to organizing as it
solves.

Fractured Left

"We, the Left, have been described as being, weak, fractured,
disorganized. I
attribute that to three things-COINTELPRO. 501(c)3. Capitalism,"
deadpans
Suzanne Pharr at a conference, entitled "The Revolution Will Not Be
Funded:
Beyond the Non-Profit Industrial Complex" in May 2004. Few grassroots
organizers
can claim a tour of duty more impressive than Suzanne Pharr, whose work
traverses the past thirty years. She is an author, founding member and
director
of the Arkansas Women's Project for nineteen years, and former director
of the
Highlander Research and Education Center. During her days in Arkansas
she
participated in the internal struggles that eventually led her
anti-domestic
violence organization to adopt the non-profit model.

After years of effectively organizing a grassroots core, Pharr had
reached an
impasse. She struggled with the need to have a greater impact in the
movement to
end violence against women, which required working with the array of
political
forces outside the grassroots. Becoming a non-profit represented one
major step
in that direction, facilitating the political goals of
"credibility...the
approval of churches, clubs, and even law enforcement." Yet, she
debated if
registering as a non-profit would deliver these goals or take them
away. Time
would tell. "I've seen the loss of political force and movement
building," says
Pharr, reflecting on the over-saturation of non-profit models within
today's New
Left struggles. The most troubling aspect of these losses, she says, is
that
they were not so much based on sharp difference on key political
issues, but
rather "the dreadful competition among organizations for little pots of
money."

Years ago the Left made a decision to go down a certain road towards
non-profit
incorporation. There were some victories but also a good number of
political
casualties, according to those who took part in that turn. Yet open
dialogue on
the complex challenges posed by the non-profit has often taken a back
seat to
the immediate need of getting important work done. Resultantly, a new
generation
of leaders inherit the unresolved dilemmas.

Heavy legacies

New activists in community, labor, and justice struggles are soon made
aware
that they bear heavy burdens. They must carry forth movements that
ended Jim
Crow, created environmental justice, and inspired mass anti-war
protests. The
young organizer can take a course that covers Cesar Chavez, Dolores
Huerta, and
the United Farm Workers and learn that all union members, even the
lowest paid,
contributed regular membership dues. Chavez insisted, "this is the only
way the
workers will 'own' the organization." Young activists will inevitably
take a
hard look at grassroots organizing that lives on foundation grants,
hires a
development director to raise funds to free others to do the real work,
and
adopts management systems which are foreign, if not alienating, to the
values
and skills-set of the grassroots base. Contradictions will be analyzed:

Why do we apply for a police permit to protest the police?
.Because if we break the law, our board is liable.

Why can't we lobby?
.Because that would violate our 501(c)3 status and the conditions of
our grant.

Why not just take the streets?
.Because insurance doesn't cover it.

The non-profit is cast as the straw man against a multitude of political
frustrations. With the severe limitations (shackles) placed on the Left
today,
defense against right-wing attack must be accompanied by the exorcising
of
'untidy' internal contradictions.

Nonprofit blues

Indeed, the majority of organizational leaders I've sat down with over
the past
year and a half-whose work ranges from defeating the onset of neoliberal
policies in public schools, to the ongoing struggle against police
violence, to
defending the rights of immigrant communities-have experienced, to
varying
degrees, an onset of the NP blues. They are concerned about the ways in
which
the priorities of philanthropy tamper with the organizing work, or how
NP
governance makes impossible the principle of unity which calls for
youth and
working class people at the center. Worse still is how hiring and
promotion
policies have led to competition and individualism among the ranks.

Still, despite the seeming ubiquity of the dilemma, a broad and
consistent
public discussion is absent. Each finds his or her own way to manage the
contradictions. In my conversations with participants who attended the
"Revolution Will Not Be Funded," many lefties talked of participating
in the NP
as a tactic on the "down low," a temporary ride toward a more radical
end. Yet
candid discussions on just how long we ride this Trojan horse, or how
far we've
actually traveled, are few and far between. For those who have
steadfastly
refused to go NP, they too maintain silence-for the most part.

Perhaps it would be beneficial to return to the historical moment in
question.
The origin point can be found at the dawn of the Reagan era, somewhere
in the
early to mid 1980s. This was the juncture at which significant strands
of the
New Left decided to turn down the NP road. What were the internal
conditions
that led to that turn? There are three interrelated factors that
standout- the
deconsolidation of the party-builders and the proliferation of New
Social
Movements, Baby-boomers with loot, and the question of legitimacy. What
ensues
is a very rough sketch of each.

New movements

Throughout much of the 1970s, there was a strong current within the New
Left
that sought to harness and consolidate the political energies of the
late 1960s
into the revolutionary party. The years 1965-1969 were those mercurial
years,
which saw the rise of numerous liberation struggles led by groups such
as the
Black Panther Party (and the ensuing "Panther effect:" Young Lords, I
Wor Kuen,
Brown Berets), the Women's Liberation Movements (some led by white
women, others
by Third World sistas), Lesbian and Gay Liberation struggles and the
meteoric
rise of the anti-war movement. Max Elbaum describes the period as
"Revolution in
Air"-it was a feeling, a texture, of multiple resistances, each with
its own
brilliance and complexity.

By the 1970s many of the self-identified revolutionary forces within
this New
Left turned their attention to party building efforts aimed at
consolidating the
many movements in an effort to strike a unified revolutionary blow
against the
establishment. But for some, party-building came at the cost of
extracting
valuable time and attention from community-based struggles. For others,
it meant
erasing or subordinating the particular character of race, gender,
sexual, and
class oppression for the sake of a "higher degree" of unity. And for
others
still, party building would mark the beginning of deep sectarian
fighting
between different cadres, not to mention the abuses of power within
parties and
revolutionary organizations.

The troubled efforts of the party-builders paralleled the rise and
proliferation
of "New Social Movements" (NSMs)-led by those who had either departed
from,
resisted, or simply ignored the push to consolidate the revolutionary
party. By
the early 80s, with many party building efforts in decline, the NSMs
continued
to grow and proliferate, codifying their struggles under semi-new
banners such
as: Environmental Justice, Racial Justice, No Nukes, Housing
Organizing, Youth
Development, Community Development and Anti-poverty. These would
provide for the
new social justice categories that would eventually be adapted by the
philanthropic foundations.

Baby boomers

Yet who are the people behind these mysterious foundations who donate a
portion
of their excesses to the grassroots? And since when do the wealthy give
generously to progressive, even radical, causes? The New Left described
above
was one part of a broader countercultural movement whose core consisted
largely
of middle-class youth with an occasional sprinkling of the children of
the
wealthy. By the 80s, many of the baby boomers born to wealth were
inheriting
portions of their families' estate. And those still partially faithful
to
movement values became reliable individual donors to NSM struggles
close to
their hearts.

Yet those with serious loot established "family foundations"-non profit
institutions that do the work of finding and funding worthy projects.
The vast
majority of these foundations can only give grants to groups with NP
status.
Between 1975 and 1988, the total number of philanthropic foundations
jumped from
21,887 to 30,338. By 2000, that number would reach 56,582. Many of
these were
small family foundations, signaling a new, albeit small and selective,
funding
source for the grassroots. This was much needed respite for community
based
struggles weathering the cutbacks to federally funded anti poverty
programs that
were originally designed under the Kennedy-Johnson "Great Society" era
and
narrowly resuscitated under Carter, before being cut down by Reagan.

Institutional power

During this same period, it got in the heads of some on the left that
in order
to have impact, the movement needed to take on the sharper image. It
needed to
get with the times (or the Times) and make an impression on
institutional power
as opposed to being its incessant pain in the ass. Instead of
"mau-mauing" the
suits for big promises that amounted mere bread crumbs, it was
suggested that
the left try donning a suit and grabbing a seat at the table to win big.

The penultimate examples of this are the former new lefties who ran for
political office during the 80s and 90s, deciding to work with instead
of
against the Democratic Party. For those with slightly smaller egos but
no less
ambition, the mission became to start influential non-profit
organizations that
could press for the incremental gains that would perhaps lead, finally,
to those
Marxian qualitative leaps.

Of course, there were those who pleaded in vein with their erstwhile
comrades to
not go the route of legitimacy-to hold out just a little longer. For
many of
them the story abruptly ends here. Their generation simply "sold out,"
as the
crabby expression goes, forever abandoning the good idea of revolution.
But sell
out talk-which is absolutist in both its form and intent-does little to
guide us
through our present-day dilemmas.

Alternative Spaces

The "whole sell out theory crowds out the discussion of burn-out,"
remarks
Makani Themba-Nixon, director of the Washington D.C.-based Praxis
Project,
referring to those who were exhausted by the internal political
processes and
abuses of institutional authority in various revolutionary parties and
collectives. Many people sought alternative spaces to carry out their
work.
According to Themba-Nixon, "women in particular needed a way to get
away from
the sexism, the exploitation, the rough stuff" found within
revolutionary
organizations. Internal problems were "more the issue behind people
leaving than
the external politics," she says. The emergence of the non-profit, Pharr
explains, provided the opportunity to continue to "do smart work,
practical
work, in a way that allowed you to survive. This was especially
important after
witnessing those who did not survive."

Themba-Nixon's observations would caution against sweeping calls for
the New
Left's full retreat from non-profits. Autonomous movements are not
inoculated
from sharp power imbalances (typified by middle-class leadership),
competitiveness, and internal exploitation. In fact, the New Left's
failure to
implement and sustain anti-hierarchal principles, to care for the
long-term
development of all members, and to promote a diverse movement culture of
participation led many to create non-profits as alternative spaces for
effective
organizing.

Civil society

These days, there's a small movement storm brewing in Atlanta, Georgia.
In the
summer of 2006, the city will play host to the first United States
Social Forum
(USSF), a gathering projected at 20,000 participants from a wide cross
section
of the grassroots including labor, environmental justice, immigrant
rights,
racial justice, anti-war, youth and student, women, LGBT, international
solidarity. Although the USSF will not take up resolving the NP dilemma
as a
stated objective or "thematic area" it may provide a space to shed some
much-needed light on the matter.

The USSF is an official regional forum of the World Social Forum (WSF)
which,
for the past six years, has coalesced social movements from around the
world to
discuss an array of locally derived "global strategies" to defeat the
agendas of
world trade, war, and the new imperialism. The groups that comprise
this new
global movement are not political parties or government representatives
of left
leaning nation states. Rather they consider themselves part of a new
"civil
society"-an array of locally based struggles and supporting NGOs.

On January 1, 1994, the world caught a glimpse of this new civil
society in
action, as a relatively small band of indigenous Mayan freedom fighters
from the
Southwest state of Chiapas known as the Zapatistas led the once
improbable
people's uprising against globalization. The Zapatistas would advance
the idea
that those who were to defend the people in this "Fourth World War"
were not the
national liberation armies of old but rather a new Mexican civil society
comprised of indigenous social movements completely independent of the
public
and private sectors.

This concept of civil society included non-indigenous Mexican civilian
groups
who saw their own futures inextricably linked to that of the indigenous
struggle
against neoliberalism including NGOs. Under the auspices of Mexican
civil
society, the autonomous social movement and the institutionalized NGO
strive for
balance-each understands the specific and complementary role it plays in
articulating the new social formation.

Complementary role

The NGO is not the subject of the social movement, but rather the
political and
technical support for the struggle. The NGO leverages funds to the
autonomous
grassroots groups, helps the movement build connection to those beyond
the
borders of the nation-state, provides training, education, and
infrastructural
support (the development of health clinics, schools, alternative media
centers,
etc.), and serves as a liaison between government officials and
autonomous
movements.

Yet, before we take heart that the new paradigm of civil society and
its WSF
provide a solution for our generation, it is worth noting that, here
too,
contradictions abound. The WSF has been criticized for its heavy
presence of
NGOs-most of whom can afford to send large delegations by plane-while
the
members of their nation's autonomous movements have less access, often
arriving
to the forum after weeks of traveling over rough terrain.

There are indeed NGOs throughout Latin America, Asia, and Africa that
have come
under fire for at times tipping the balance, eclipsing the autonomous
movements.
Writer/activist Arundhati Roy, for example, has been a particularly
harsh critic
of NGOs operating in India, noting the ways is which they can often
serve the
neoliberal "developing nation" agenda.

US context

But for the US left, the concept of civil society may still prove
valuable to
those attempting to navigate their way through today's NP dilemmas.

"We never had it from the beginning," says Jerome Scott of his
organization's
501c3 status, as he reflects on its twenty year history. The
organization is
Project South based in Atlanta, and it will play the role of an anchor
organization for the USSF. An autoworker and shop floor organizer from
Detroit,
Scott once participated in the famous "wild cat" strikes of 1973, led
in part by
the League of Revolutionary Black Workers. In the late-1970s, he
relocated to
the Southeast, where things were a bit "more raw."

By the early 80s, the Southeast was experiencing major political
backlash
against the gains of the Civil Rights movement. Scott along with several
comrades from Detroit, who had also surreptitiously made their way down
South,
began organizing campaigns to bring attention to the profound poverty,
unemployment, and racism that characterized the post-Civil Rights era.
The
founding of Project South can be viewed as the continuation on the part
of Scott
and his comrades to build the independent movements that characterized
their
days back in Detroit.

During the first ten years of its existence, Project South was not a
NP, nor did
it receive significant grants from foundations or individual donors.
The work
was carried-out through a collective of volunteer activists,
organizers, and
visionaries. It was only in 1995, long after the organization had been
on the
radar of many progressive philanthropy eager to fund it, that Project
South
decided to incorporate as an NP.

Today, with approximately a half dozen staff members, a large office
within a
community-space, and the support of several foundations, Project South
continues
to be guided by the principles upon which it was founded. From salary
parity, to
an uncompromising people-centered mission, to engaging in a range of
tactics
(including lobbying), to anchoring the USSF conference, Project South
is a
successful example of an autonomous movement's successful transition to
non-profit status.

Perhaps some activists who, unlike Project South, consciously and
deliberately
founded NPs two decades ago, did so with the confidence that other
forms of
autonomous struggle would continue to grow and push forward. The role
of their
NP institutions would therefore be only complementary, supplemental, or
supportive to it-one of many means of tilting the broader political
spectrum
toward liberation politics.

Today however, US based non-profits find themselves awkwardly at the
movement's
center. We must address the imbalance between autonomous movements and
non-profits. This is an ontological question: can a non-profit give
life to that
which is a precondition of its own existence? The non-profit can clear
the path
for revolution by dismantling its own policies and practices that
prevent
grassroots movements from truly impacting political institutions-from
the
electoral college, to the denial of proportional representation, to the
collapse
of the social welfare state, to the roll-back on civil rights.

No, the revolution will not be funded. We would need to find it first.

just thought you might be interested in the upshot of the craig's list =
LA
poets for pay posting; it is, I suppose, a good idea, although his =
"friend"
Chenoa Smith's business is very scary indeed.

the idea --writing poems akin to commissioned corridos -- is I suppose a
good enough one, tho here perhaps more like getting a caricature done at =
a
carnival -- commissioning corridos is pretty popular here in LA

all best,
Catherine Daly

My name is Ingo Janetschek. I was born in Vienna, Austria were I also
grew up for most part of my life. My body age is 36 years and my spirit
is eternal. I am living now in Los Angeles since November 1997 and since
almost 2 years I am married to a beautiful Panamanian spirit.

As you might have guessed already I am an artist at heart. Basically I
am a musician but I love all forms of expression and I have found a
great outlet for them at the Caf=E9 Rockotitlan on Wilton and Fountain =
in
Hollywood at Expression Mondays.
http://www.newearthlife.org/Expression_Mondays.html and have always
aspired to finding a way to get not only out of the 9-5 trap myself but
help other artists as well walking this new path with me. =20

[this is a local caf=E9 with a generous open mike policy -- a friend who
doesn't drink anymore is in a band that plays at this coffeehouse fairly
frequently]

Finding a way, that would not only be enhancing to them but also to the
customers, while the artist would actually do what he/she loves to do
and get plenty of monetary exchange and still would have plenty of time
at hand to just create or kick back or how ever he or she wishes to be
in life.

As our society is changing in a very fast pace and so also our cultural
values and the market place I knew I had to find a new way on how to
make it workable and worthwhile to make a living as an artist.

I came up with one idea in regards to personalized poetry. But once I
did some research on it I found out this I idea wasn=92t so new after =
all.
Some other people had that one already before me. Nevertheless, looking
at the popularity of poetry on the internet, the =93competition=94 (I do =
not
consider my fellow artists competitors) is so little and in fact most
individuals one talks to on the street have never heard about such a
product.

Also knowing that art is the soul food for the people I know there is a
huge market out there. How much do you like to get touched by a poem or
any kind of art when you are down? When your day wasn=92t that good? I
know you know how such a piece of art can change your mood in an instant
and put you back in touch with what is important in life, isn=92t it?

Looking at the state of our current society, how many people are truly
happy?

I do see a chance that we can remind them of true values, of things
they=92ve always longed for and with giving the gift of a poem, in a =
very
personalized way, we can connect them back to what they hold dear and
know that they are not alone.

So, yes, I am an idealist and the path I am walking is a new one. Nobody
has walked it yet the way I want to do it. Just know, don=92t quit your
job yet. But I hope you will soon. That is my wish for you and all of =
us.

I have partnered up with a very good friend of mine. Chenoa Smith. You
can check her out under www.livingtheories.com She will oversee the
distribution of our products while I run, organize and direct the =
company.

Once it is running and we know how to work it, we will expand this
concept not only into new stores, cities and countries but also start
new product lines as ideas I have plenty.

Most of the proceeds and profits coming out of this business will go to
a way higher purpose since it is my life goal to host a village where
artists get rehabilitated in their expressions and learn how to market
themselves effectively so they are independent and don=92t need to
compromise their own art and form of expression.

So, if you are interested in pioneering this area, I would like to meet
with you in person so we can get to know each other better. Let me know
when that is possible. Evenings and weekends work best for me. Starting
this weekend.

Sincerely,

Ingo Janetschek

ANDREAS MÜLLER (LONDON)
http://hahakid.net/forallseasons/forallseasons.html

"For All Seasons" is an unusual piece of digital poetry. It is 3D,
programmed in C++, available for Windows and Mac, quite deluxe in its
interface (see the Readme for details) and very responsive. Also, the
environments are well-realized both in several literary senses and as
literary machines. "For All Seasons" consists of four
movements/worlds/cantos/whatever--one for each season.

The poems are linked in various ways. They all are concerned with memories
of youth. With memories of dandelions and fishing with a little net (as for
butterflies), with the whirlwinds of autumn and snow in trees in winter.
Very much poems of innocence and wonder. Poems of innocence and wonder can
be very tiresome indeed--for their lack, really, of either. The digital
aspects of these poems, however, are exceptionally strong in their
wonderment, and somewhat brilliantly realized in contrast with the page that
opens each poem.

"Spring", like the rest, opens with a brief text. The white page/black type
then transforms into a 3D space and textual dandelions begin to grow from
the page. Letters that form words are attached to stalks like dandelion
parachute seeds are attached to stems. You use the left and right mouse
buttons and the scroll wheel to move through the 3D world and blow the
lettristic seeds through the 'air'. It is wonderful to move into this space
and look up at them as trees.

"Summer" opens with a text of fishing with a net as a child. When you then
click the text, the words are transformed in such a way that they behave
very like fishes in their swimming. Again, you use the mouse buttons and
wheel to swim through the schools of wordly fishes. The behaviors, once
again, are eloquently realized. That is an odd word in this context,
'eloquently', but I think it is apt. Muller's work is, in part, expressive
computation. He is a very fine programmer and is never so happy as when he
can create art with it.

"Fall"'s opening text is tranformed into the sort of whirlwind we see in the
fall that sweeps fallen leaves into the air. This is a gentle whirlwind,
gentle vortex, gentle whirlwind.

"For All Seasons" is exceptionally expressive in highly unusual ways. In
many ways it is also quite 'concrete' in its mimeticism. Some see the
mimeticism of much concrete as a bit of a failure of imagination. Others
point out the fundamental thrust of concrete, its universalist committment
to understandable communication across language and educational barriers and
say that the mimeticism of concrete is not a failure of the imagination but
reflects a committment to grounded and universal communication. Certainly
the texts of "For All Seasons" can communicate before they are understood.

Altogether, I would have to say it's a remarkable piece of work in both its
affective dimensions and as a literary machine.

Small Press Traffic is pleased to present
a reading by
Steven Farmer & Diane Ward
Friday, November 4, 2005 at 7:30 p.m.


Steven Farmer is the author of five collections of poetry, the most recent of
which is Medieval (Krupskaya, 1999). Robert Fitterman writes "when the lyric
poem rings the bottom of its community well, it sounds like the moving and
relevant poems in Steve Farmer's Medieval." Trained/untrained in literature at
UCSD, Farmer has been a Bay Area transplant ever since. After many years in
the restaurant business, he now works in the information technology industry.
He will be reading from his new manuscript, Autopsia.


Diane Ward joins us from Los Angeles to read from new work. A.L. Nielsen
describes her as "among those rare poets who have found new ways to address
the political in lyric forms...there is in all Ward's works the type of formal
diversity we have come to expect from the walking wonders who comprise our
most interesting poets." Her books include Relation (Roof Books, 1989),
Imaginary Movie (Potes & Poets, 1992), Human Ceiling (Roof Books, 1995), and
Maps & Portraits (ML & NLF, 2002). Ward co-edits Primary Writing.



& upcoming: 11/18--Brandon Brown & Brent Cunningham; 12/2--Del Ray Cross &
Graham Foust



Unless otherwise noted, events are $5-10, sliding scale, free to current SPT

Unless otherwise noted, our events are presented in

CANADIAN BELLADONNA* (part two)

with

Nathalie Stephens
& Rachel Zolf

Tuesday, November 8, 7PM
@ Dixon Place
(258 Bowery, 2nd Floor—Between Houston & Prince)
Admission is $5 at the Door.

Nathalie Stephens writes in English and French, and sometimes neither.
Writing l’entre-genre, she is the author of several published works, most
recently L’Injure (l’Hexagone, 2004), Paper City (Coach House, 2003), and Je
Nathanaël (l’Hexagone, 2003). L’Injure was a finalist for the 2005 Prix
Trillium; Underground (TROIS, 1999) was short listed in 2000 for the Grand
Prix du Salon du livre de Toronto. Stephens’s writing appears in various
anthologies, including Shift & Switch: New Canadian Poetry (2005), Biting
the Error: Writers Explore Narrative (Coach House, 2004), Breathing Fire II
(Nightwood, 2004), Portfolio Milieu (Milieu Press, 2004), The Common Sky :
Canadian Writers Against the War (Three Squares, 2003), La Cendre des mots
(l’Harmattan, 2002), side/lines: A New Canadian Poetics (Insomniac Press,
2002), Mondialisation et Identité (GREF, 2001) and Carnal Nation : Brave New
Sex Fictions (Arsenal Pulp, 2000). Stephens has presented her work
internationally, notably in Barcelona, Chicago, Norwich, Ljubljana and New
York. She is the recipient of a 2002 Chalmers Arts Fellowship and a 2003
British Centre for Literary Translation Residential Bursary. Some of
Stephens’s work has been translated into Basque, Bulgarian, Slovene and
Spanish. She has translated Catherine Mavrikakis and François Turcot into
English and R. M. Vaughan into French. On occasion, she translates herself.
She lives between.

Toronto poet Rachel Zolf’s practice is situated near the limits of language
and the page. She creates polyvocal assemblages from found fragments, long
poems that work by accretion with montage shock effects. Themes that include
subjectivity, cultural identity, sexuality and trauma stew in wry
anti-aesthetic language/lyric explorations of the modern familiar. Her
second book, Masque (The Mercury Press, 2004), was nominated for the 2005
Trillium Book Award for Poetry, and the title long poem from her first book,
Her absence, this wanderer (BuschekBooks, 1999), was a finalist in the CBC
Literary Competition. She serves as poetry editor for The Walrus magazine.

Belladonna* is a feminist/innovative reading and publication series that
promotes the work of women writers who are adventurous, experimental,
politically involved, multi-form, multicultural, multi-gendered,
unpredictable, dangerous with language (to the death machinery). In its five
year history, Belladonna* has featured such writers as Leslie Scalapino,
Alice Notley, Erica Hunt, Fanny Howe, Mei-mei Berssenbrugge, Cecilia Vicuña,
Lisa Jarnot, Camille Roy, Nicole Brossard, Abigail Child, Norma Cole, Lynne
Tillman, Gail Scott and Carla Harryman among many other experimental and
hybrid women writers. Beyond being a platform for women writers, the
curators promote work that is experimental in form, connects with other art
forms, and is socially/politically active in content. Alongside the
readings, Belladonna* supports its artists by publishing commemorative
pamphlets of their work on the night of the event. Please contact us (Erica
Kaufman, Rachel Levitsky et al) at belladonnaseries@yahoo.com to receive a
catalog and be placed on our list.

Dixon Place, a home for performing and literary artists, is dedicated to
supporting the creative process by presenting original works of theater,
dance and literature at various stages of development. An artistic
laboratory with an audience, we serve as a safety net, enabling artists to
present challenging and questioning work that pushes the limits of artistic
expression. With a warm, nurturing atmosphere that encourages and inspires
artists of all stripes and persuasions, we place special emphasis on the
needs of women, people of color, youth, seniors and lesbian/gay artists. The
artist's experience is given top priority through our professional
atmosphere and remuneration, and their process is enhanced through the
reaction of our adventurous audiences. Dixon Place is a local haven for
creativity as well as an international model for the open exploration of the
process of creation.  Please visit www.dixonplace.org for more information
*deadly nightshade, a cardiac and respiratory stimulant, having purplish-red
flowers and black berries

Belladonna* readings happen monthly between September and June. We are
grateful for partial funding by Poets and Writers, CLMP, NYSCA, and Dixon
Place.

Granary Books is pleased to announce that ARCANA: MUSICIANS ON MUSIC
edited by John Zorn is back in stock after a two year hiatus.

Answering a need for critical attention towards experimental and
avant-garde music, ARCANA is a ground-breaking work -- as far-ranging
and dynamic as the current generation of musicians. Through
manifestoes, scores, interviews, notes, and critical papers,
performer/composers address composing, playing, improvising, teaching,
and thinking through music. Rather than an attempt to distill or define
musicians' work, ARCANA illuminates with personal vision and
experience. ARCANA is a remarkable book -- challenging and original --
essential for composers, musicians, theorists, and fans alike.

"ARCANA is vibrant testimony to the continuing vitality of new music.
These exciting young composers are as idiosyncratic and eloquent with
words as they are with music." -- Meredith Monk

Hi...

I sometimes wonder where my life disappeared to, as I slave away in the
Jacket salt mines night and day.

...then something nice happens, and I think it's worth it after all.

Today the visits counter on Jacket's homepage clicked over the half million
mark.

	http://jacketmagazine.com/

Now is that one obsessive fan, coming back time after time in the vain hope
of seeing his poem published, or is it half a million eager visitors who
take one look at Jacket and run away, never to return!?

The minimalist concrete poetry site at:

http://www.logolalia.com/minimalistconcretepoetry/

has been updated with 12 pieces by Irving Weiss. Because these are all
studies in the poem as print object, they're being presented in .pdf
form, and while it is certainly possible to enjoy these pieces within
the .pdf reader of your choice, I would like to take this opportunity
to encourage you to print these poems out and hold them in your
hands. It is how they were intended to be seen, and I believe you will
find that they both invite and reward closer inspection.

Enjoy,
Dan

PLAN B – REMOVE AND DISPERSE INDIGENOUS PEOPLE
- the Keshachewan Experiment

Kahentinetha Horn - MNN Mohawk Nation News

MNN.mohawknationnews@gmail.com

MNN. Oct. 30, 2005. Kashechewan, a remote northern Ontario Cree
community of almost 2000 people has become an international scandal over
reports of contaminated water. It’s called a “fly-in” community because
there is no road in. One thousand people have been evacuated because of
sicknesses created by contaminated water.

Ten years ago Indian Affairs designed a water treatment system where
Hollow Creek joins the Albany River which drains into James Bay. James
Bay is the southern part of Hudson’s Bay. This is where Keshachewan is
located. The two are fresh water rivers flowing into the salt water bay.
Fort Albany is a little way up the Albany River.

As they have done in so many other communities, Indian Affairs forgot
about little details like health, safety and clean water. The Indian
Affairs engineer built the water plant 135 meters downstream from a
sewage lagoon. It flows right past the water intake pipe and sewage goes
into the drinking water. He forgot about the tide that comes in and
backs up the sewage into the drinking water. As a result the water pipe
delivers deadly E-coli right into everybody’s kitchen tap.

Health Canada’s solution? Based on their expertise and experience, they
told the people to just put more and more chlorine in the water, boil it
and then drink it. Almost all have come down with severe skin infections
and unknown sicknesses. Was this one of their weird twisted experiments,
or what? You don’t need to be an Einstein to know what happened. It’s a
disaster!

Last year Indian Affairs, which has never hesitated to throw good money
after bad, paid $500,000 for an upgrade. But they forgot to move the
intake pipe! In the last six months Indians Affairs has sent in $250,000
worth of bottled water. To try to fix the system the people tied a rope
and a wood plank to hold the water plant together.

Lately they have been going to the Albany River and lugging back buckets
of water to drink. Even this water is contaminated.

The young people want to revive the ancient custom of taking drinking
water upstream before the sewage. They want to move further inland to
higher ground. Keshachewan is built on a flood plain with a dike all the
way around the community to stop the floods that come with the tides. It
was Indian Affairs’ idea that Indians should spend the whole year at a
seasonal camp on a flood plain. I wonder if they used the engineers that
built New Orleans as consultants! The older people want to stay because
they’ve become attached to the location.

Canada’s been sending aid all over the world. Now it’s revealed that the
water in 70% of Indian communities is a health risk. It would cost
Indian Affairs $1.4 billion to fix all their mistakes. Has Indian
Affairs ever sued an engineering firm for incompetence? Or is this Plan
B of the old genocide project? Dying race and all that! Tsk! Tsk! Or
maybe it’s just a question of giving contracts to political hacks to pay
off a few seedy debts, eh! Everybody is in the habit of blaming the
“Injuns” for draining the public purse anyway. The whole mess is pretty
damn shocking!!

“Kopy Kat Kanada”. Indian Affairs sent in the army and put up some
tents. (I’m sure they’d rather go up there than to the Middle East.) In
the meantime, Ontario shuffled 1000 to Cochrane, Sudbury and parts
unknown. The elders are very upset about letting them leave as they may
never come back. They’re getting residential school flashbacks. Everyone
is haunted by horror stories about our youth adrift in the south. Indian
Affairs works constantly at dissolving distinct Indigenous communities.

They think they can shove us into a non-native community and we can live
like everybody else. This relocation strategy will dissolve the
community. Relocation has been a disaster every time it’s been tried.
Chief, council and everyone are trying to keep the community together.
They feel it’s urgent to do something now.

Kashechewan is inundated with media. Almost everyone is getting cameras,
microphones and reporters in their faces. It’s the news of the moment.
They’ll all leave and no one will hear about Kashechewan again.

It’s another experiment. Move the Indians away from their original
constitutional territory onto another Indigenous nation’s land. This
separates them from their spiritual ties. Skylnick in her book “A Poison
Stronger than Love” proved removals are a big “make work” project for
Indian Affairs, who always say, “We’ll make the decisions for them”. The
1960’s experiment on relocating Indians all had to be reversed in the
end. Some were relocated to Elliot Lake, the Menominees were terminated,
the Innu were relocated to Davis Inlet. The common thread is that by
such removals they lost their land and had to be reintegrated later.
Indian Affairs never lets the people decide. They don’t intend to do
what’s decent and good for the Indians.

Here’s another slant. What’s really going on here?

The North American Free Trade Agreement NAFTA was the crowning glory of
former Prime Minister Brian Mulroney and his negotiator, Simon Riesman.
They gave away Canadian water to the U.S.

In NAFTA Canada cannot withhold its water from the United States.
Americans are depleting their fresh water resources and are demanding
the right to get Canadian water. One idea was to divert all the rivers
that flow into James Bay into the Great Lakes. Then send it to the
Midwestern U.S. to irrigate land Americans have turned into a parched
“dust bowl”.

Another plan was to build a dike separating James Bay and Hudson’s Bay.
Then James Bay would be drained into the Hudson’s Bay. This would be
filled up with fresh water from the rivers that flow north from the
Canadian Shield. A huge reservoir would cover the whole area. This would
be rerouted south to the U.S., or pumped into the Great Lakes and piped out.

The main U.S. concern is that the Mississippi is no longer viable. The
population in California is over 40 million and it’s dry. They
desperately need water. Canada has the most fresh water in the world.
The U.S. wants it. The Indians are in the way.

To carry out this plan, all Indian communities on Hudson’s Bay and James
Bay will have to be removed before the area is flooded. The Indians are
basically in the way. They live on the mouths of all the rivers draining
into James Bay. They want the northern indigenous communities to pay for
the U.S. environmental catastrophe.

On top of all this, the U.S. is going to get Canada to build the
structure which has been designed to make sure the U.S. gets all the
benefits. In fact, they already probably have signed documents making it
look the Indians consented. What they’ve forgotten is Sections 109 and
132 of the Canadian Constitution stipulates that the Indians have prior
interests that supercede that of Canada and its provinces. They have to
deal with us first. Hee haw!

There are 100 reserves that they say have contaminated waters. The
Indians will all have to be removed. This experiment with the
Kashechewan community is only the beginning.

Edith Arnstein Jenkins, a noted Bay Area poet and longtime professor
of English at Laney and Merritt colleges in Oakland, died Oct. 20 at
her home in San Francisco. She was 92.

Mrs. Jenkins was devoted throughout her life to progressive political
activism and also, as an educator, to helping her students appreciate
poetry, particularly the lyricism and humor of Shakespeare's plays,
as well as his deep insights into war and peace.

Her own volume of memoirs and stories, entitled "Against a Field
Sinister," was published by City Lights Press in 1991 and was praised
by critics for its elegiac tone. The book also became a valued source
of information for the authors of the recently published "American
Prometheus," a definitive biography of physicist J. Robert
Oppenheimer whom Mrs. Jenkins knew well, along with his circle of
politically radical Berkeley and San Francisco friends.

An earlier book of poetry by Mrs. Jenkins, "Invisions on a Ground,"
was nominated for an award by the Bay Area Book Reviewers
Association, and a poetry chapbook, "The Width of a Vibrato," was
published in 1990. A final collection, "Selected Poems," was
published in 2001, and San Francisco writer and critic Tillie Olson
called her work "distinguished by luminous intellect, wit and
passionately controlled depth."

Mrs. Jenkins was born in San Francisco, and graduated from UC
Berkeley with honors in English in 1935. After graduate studies at
Columbia University, she began studying law at UC Berkeley's Boalt
Hall, then switched to English, and earned her master's degree at San
Francisco State College (now University) in 1959.

As a college teacher, Mrs. Jenkins was widely known -- particularly
at Merritt College -- for inspiring her students to read and
understand the deepest works of Shakespeare.

Her continuing output of poetry was widely published over the years
by journals and magazines such as the Threepenny Review, the
Massachusetts Review, the Five Fingers Review, Mother Jones and
Feminist Studies. She was often asked to read her poems at Bay Area
bookstores, the Fresno Art Museum and the Poetry Center at San
Francisco State University.

Mrs. Jenkins was an active board member of the Poetry Center and also
of Small Press Traffic, an eclectic San Francisco literary arts
center at California College of the Arts that is home to experimental
writing and to poetry in many languages and from many cultures. She
also served on the focus committee for the Master of Arts Writing
Program at the University of San Francisco.

In 1992, Mrs. Jenkins received the Maggie Kuhn Literary Arts award,
named for the militant founder of the Gray Panthers, an advocacy
organization focusing on the health and independence of older women.

Mrs. Jenkins's husband, David, died in 1993.

She is survived by three daughters, Becky, [choreographer "Margy"]
Margaret Jenkins Wax and Rachel Jenkins; a son, David; and seven
grandchildren.

The family suggests contributions to Amnesty International, the Labor
Archive at San Francisco State University or Small Press Traffic.

A memorial service will be held at 3 p.m on Saturday, Jan. 7, at the
Unitarian Center, 1187 Franklin St., San Francisco.

Thanks, Ron, for posting Edith's obituary from today's San Francisco
Chronicle. Edith, as a writer and historian of the local - was a good friend
to many younger poets in the City - and, definitely, of a fearless seeming
generation of the 30's progressives.
In addition to being mom to Margaret Jenkins - the choreographer and
frequent collaborator with Michael Palmer among others - Edith's husband
David was Harry Bridges right hand man in the Longshoremen's Union.
I think all of the Jenkins family members have been variously "forces of
nature" in the Bay Area social, political and cultural fabric.

Such a gift and example.

Malok is a one-man mailart machine hiding away in the village of
Waukau, Wisconsin. Resigned to a lifetime of cutting and pasting
little bits of text, found media & female genitalia from his
extensive porn collection, he has manufactured an extensive heap of
work, most of it distributed to hundreds of international contacts
via the mailart network.  For years he has resisted going online but
the lure of fame & money has finally convinced him to leap over the
digital divide.  The result is the definitive MALOK website, complete
with a database of his whollytexts, glyphucks and collages.  Diehard
Malok fans will want to check back for the release of "The Perfect
Malokian Dogma", an upclose & personal documentary by filmmaker
CamillE BacoS, to be released on Malok's birthday, December 10, 2005.

Xerox Sutra Editions has released as a full-color downloadable pdf
the 80s anthem of the insane, Malok's FUCK DIRGE.

Due to the graphic content of Malok's collages this site is not

Richard Jeffrey Newman will be reading from his translation of Saadi's
Gulistan on Tuesday November 1 at Alwan for the Arts, www.alwan.org,
starting at 7 PM. Details are below:

WHY PERSIAN LITERATURE? WHY NOW?

SAADI'S 13TH CENTURY ROSE GARDEN IN TODAY'S WORLD



Saadi of Shiraz, a contemporary of Rumi, is one of the masters of classical
Persian literature. His masterpiece, the Gulistan (Rose Garden), is revered
worldwide both for the literary pleasure it provides and for the wisdom it
contains. In the 1600s, Andre du Ryer's translation of the Gulistan into
French gave the West one of its first sympathetic windows into the world of
Islam. Subsequent translations into Dutch, Latin, German, Russian and
English spread Saadi's name and the humanistic values that are so central to
his work throughout the literary and cultural landscapes of the 18th and
19th centuries, influencing writers like Goethe, Byron, Emerson and Thoreau.
Emerson thought so highly of the Gulistan that he called it "a secular
bible." In the 20th century, a passage from the Gulistan was inscribed in
the lobby of the United Nations. Now, in the 21st century, with Iran
occupying an ever more significant place on the world stage, it is important
that we revisit that country's history and culture, reminding ourselves of
the treasures it has given the world and looking to see what we can learn
from those treasures not only about Iran and its people, but also about
ourselves.



Richard Jeffrey Newman is an essayist, poet and translator who has been
publishing his work since 1988, when the essay "His Sexuality; Her
Reproductive Rights" appeared in Changing Men magazine. Since then, his
essays and poems have appeared in Salon.com, The American Voice, The
Pedestal, Circumference, Prairie Schooner, ACM, Birmingham Poetry Reviewand
other literary journals. He has given talks and led workshops on writing
autobiographically about gender, sex and sexuality. Selections from Saadi's
Gulistan, his first book, was published in 2004 by Global Scholarly
Publications (GSP). He will be translating four more books for GSP: Saadi's
other masterpiece, the Bustan, Ferdowsi's Shahnameh, Nezami's Haft Peykar
and Attar's Elahi Nameh. His own book of poems, The Silence Of Men, is
forthcoming from CavanKerry Press. You can learn more about his work at
www.richardjnewman.com. He is an Associate Professor in the English
Department at Nassau Community College.

Yes thank you Ron for posting the obituary for Edith Jenkins! I only had one
chance to meet her, when she read at SPT a few years ago (and I thank Robert
Gluck for helping arrange this) but as a third or fourth generation
Berkeleyan (depending on how you count it) as well as simply a human, a
USAmerican, and a writer, her writing, especially _Against A Field Sinister_
is and I am quite confident will remain very valuable to me in many
dimensions. I was touched to see her family suggesting donations to SPT as
well.
Very best, Elizabeth
