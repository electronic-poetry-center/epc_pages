Kenning Editions is pleased to announce the publication of */Insomnia
and the Aunt/, by Tan Lin.*

*/Insomnia and the Aunt/, by Tan Lin.* Fiction. Literary Nonfiction.
Cross-Genre. Art. Asian American Studies. Tan Lin's INSOMNIA AND THE
AUNT is an ambient novel composed of black and white photographs,
postcards, Google reverse searches, letters, appendices, an index to an
imaginary novel, reruns, and footnotes. The aunt in question can't
sleep. She runs a motel in the Pacific Northwest. She likes watching
Conan O'Brien late at night. She may be the narrator's aunt or she may
be an emanation of a TV set. Structured like everybody's scrapbook, and
blending fiction with nonfictional events, INSOMNIA AND THE AUNT is
about identities taken and given up, and about the passions of an
immigrant life, rebroadcast as furniture. Ostensibly about a young man's
disintegrating memory of his most fascinating relative, or potentially a
conceptualist take on immigrant literature, it is probably just a
treatment for a prime-time event that, because no one sleeps in motels,
lasts into the late night and daytime slots.

Tan Lin <http://epc.buffalo.edu/authors/lin/> is the author of /Lotion
Bullwhip Giraffe/, /BlipSoak01/,/ Ambience is a Novel with a Logo/,
/Heath (Plagiarism/Outsource)/ and /7 Controlled Vocabularies and
Obituary 2004. The Joy of Cooking (2010)/. His work has appeared in
numerous journals including /Conjunctions/, /Artforum/, /Cabinet/, /New
York Times Book Review/, /Art in America/, and /Purple/. His video,
theatrical and LCD work have been shown at the Marianne Boesky Gallery,
Yale Art Museum, Sophienholm Museum (Copenhagen), Ontological Hysterical
Theatre, and as part of the Whitney Museum of American Art's Soundcheck
Series. Lin is the recipient of a Getty Distinguished Scholar Grant for
2004-2005 and a Warhol Foundation/Creative Capital Arts Writing Grant to
complete a book-length study of the writings of Andy Warhol. He has
taught at the University of Virginia and Cal Arts, and currently teaches
creative writing at New Jersey City University. He has just completed a
sampled novel, entitled /Our Feelings Were Made by Hand/.

Following on last month's _Say Throne_, by No`u Revilla, this month
brings Adam Aitken's _Tonto's Revenge_.  It's 33 pages long and yours
for $3.  Less than a gallon of gas, but travels much much further.
Better yet, send Tinfish $36 and get 12 chapbooks over the
course of a single year.

there's no money left in the budget to appropriately acknowledge the fact

as elegantly as ever.

Hey Sports Fans,

I want to break Kayfabe here and just ask how many of you guys and gals
have ever dressed up in a--you know--kind of a suit and cape on the
forums and lists--and--you know--made a (how can i say it?)--done a kind
of a--you know--performance to get a--you know--a kinda--you know--point
across and even engineered a--you know--a persona or some shit to a--you
know--that old thesis antithesis sorta--Hegelian you know than kinda
thing?

I gotta fess up, I'm not really sometimes--you know--I mean I don't
break Kayfabe usually on Poetics unless I'm--well--you know.  And then
I...well, ya know what I'm saying?  Right?

(Spitting the gum out, popping some more in),

And it's all fake blood ya know.  Or sometimes a razor blade under the
tongue.

Disembodied I

A review of "Outside Voices: An Email Correspondence" by Jake Berry and Jef=
frey Side, published by Otoliths. Reviewed by Carey Scott Wilkerson.

Extract:
"Berry and Side [...] are engaged in the most advanced and responsible disc=
ourse about writing that two people could have at a distance. Indeed, what =
begins as an old-fashioned epistolary encounter quickly becomes an extraord=
inary excavation of the big issues in contemporary writing, philosophy of l=
anguage, and meaning itself. Moreover, it almost seems that it is precisely=
 because they are writing e-mails=E2=80=94and not speaking in a seminar roo=
m=E2=80=94they find such striking Truths and alarming implications."

"Fresh, marvelously exuberant lyric wildness, picking up a bit on the sprun=
g prosody of Ceravolo's Fits of Dawn and perhaps also from Coolidge's Sound=
 as Thought. Of special interest: a set of 'Yinglish' poems that bring the =
syntax of the Yiddish into the American lyric."- Charles Bernstein




Marsh Hawk Press books often highlight the affinity of poetry and the visua=
l arts. Each book is produced with particular care to visual style, often i=
ncluding reproductions of artwork alongside poems. Marsh Hawk Press also sp=
onsors readings and exhibits, and hosts a web site with a rotating exhibiti=

Subject:      Performance/ Interview for SPECS Magazine: Addresses puppets,
              absurdity, the radioactive day and visionary poetry
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

The up-coming issue of SPECS includes my absurdist/lang piece from 1973
titled "Hands".  In this video you'll see my million dollar bike, an
irradiated, rainy sky, a sweeping view of J-kids playing b-ball in the
park, a landscape up-ended by the great earthquake but now being tucked
back in place by multiple drills and hammers to an army cot blanket's
tautness, some of the puppets from my production of Faust at the nearby
uni, an unshaven friend, my masked family, and a story that may mean
that I've been mad as a hatter since my misspent youth--or not.  Please
enjoy! Click here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kR89dwBWHNU

Who loves ya, baby?

Subject:      What good is great literature,
              etc. in Geo-Political Terms?  My Proposal for A MARCH FOR MUTATION
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

Just had a stirring encounter on this topic with our favorite
multi-translator Sam Hamil.  We like Sam, and find his translations to
be ok--though we spent a good part of a year with an absolutely
brilliant, 70 year old grad student, who is a Tokyo patent attorney--a
native speaker--and linguist, taking a good look at his version of Oku
No Hosomichi and finding it somewhat inaccurate--even in the very
beginning passage.

I lack Sam's spiritual pedigree too: I don't spout great wisdom from
the East that sounds suspiciously like bromides, I haven't guessed my
way in and around a Zen koan, or any of that stuff.  He likes to do
that, and I don't mind.

But here's the point: I love great literature and I love Sam Hamil's
work, but I see no connection between great literature, great art, great
music, and the end to violence, fascism, genocide, human suffering of
all stripes, hunger, etc.; neither do I see it as the beginning of the
fight for equality of any sort, contentment among the masses of workers,
and a torch for those toiling on in darkness, etc.

Reasonable people enjoy great literature because it presents at most
moments of clarity for them, manners of being, surprises in content and
style--memorable tropes.

I would say that tyrants and despots are not the people who march in the
streets with reasonable people demanding social equality, change, the
end to all violence and universal peace.  I would say that even if
tyrants and despots read Jack Kerouac it would still not keep them from
being tyrants and despots. In addition, I believe that even if the
leaders of the free world end their day of leading the free-est of the
free worlds by reading Jack Kerouac, Byron's Don Juan, Erica Jong's
Fear of Flying, the Great Books from Chicago, etc. those leaders, and
those tyrants and despots would still reach for the nearest telephone to
call their soldiers, their police, or their operatives when it was time
for them to deal with their sense of the "real" world and its problems.

My opinion, which I spelled out to Sam, but which he really didn't look
so closely at since he was busy telling me that one step is the
beginning of the journey of a thousand miles and that great literature
does make a difference in the world because he just knew that the Bible
and Jack Kerouac made a difference.  (He listed a few more.)

But my point was that, yes, great literature makes a difference to
reasonable people like you--reading this posting right now--and Sam, and
me--Jess--but that marching, stomping and singing "All We Are Saying is
Give Peace A Chance" and Dostoevsky and Baudelaire, etc., doesn't make
a difference to anyone but people like us.  It tends to make us feel
better.  But if you look back over history you will see that culture and
great literature has always been worthless in the face of great violence
and great despair and great suffering.  We know that Hitler read Goethe
and Grabbe and listened to Beethoven, and that other evil Idiots like
Sadam of Iraq was well up on Gilgamesh and fancied himself a poet.  Yet
he still put men in wood chippers and watched them yell until they
couldn't any more.

My thinking is that marching everywhere a million or a trillion strong is
good for us, and writing protest poetry, etc., is wonderful because
we're on the side of right.  We represent the apex of all things good,
so we should continue to make those feel-good gestures, but, honestly
folks, there's a logical disconnect here.  Great literature has been
with us for a long while and the powers that be are still violent.
We're still killing each other, still suffering in all kinds of ways.
I think Art and Culture and Literature have had a tremendous number of
chances to make a change.

In addition, it seems that tyrants and despots and even leaders of the
free world are getting better at ignoring great literature, cultural
accomplishments, marches and protests--which they are developing the
technology to control, police, manage, and delete.

What I said to Sam was that perhaps the only way to really "stop the
violence" was to change--not our ideas--but our fundamental natures so
that the old violent Homo Sapiens whose ancestors came out of Africa
with a yen for cooked meat and an ability to fashion stone tools of
ambiguous use--that Homo Sapiens that we now are--should be remade into
something other than ourselves.  The most efficient way to do it is
through science.  Prayer doesn't work.  We can't pray tyrants to
death. Singing doesn't work.  Woody Guthrie tried that and maybe Dylan
too. And anyway, tyrants and despots don't listen much to songs like
that.  Writing great books doesn't do it.  they'll just be remaindered
unless they're made into a movie with the latest heart throbs in it.  I
have no idea what forcing a Mugabi or a Khadaffi to read On the Road
would result in--but even though I'm guessing here--you hear me Sam,
I'm just guessing--I don't think it would help them help us achieve
the world peace that we sincerely seek.

Only a mutation effected through genetic means--a little radiation beamed
at the old chromosomes at the right time--would maybe zap that violent
nature of ours in the most efficient manner.  Then all those potential
wielders of power in the future would not be violent.

Then we could enjoy great literature and art without the illusion that
any of those activities that make us feel good about ourselves actually
does anything in this awful world of ours.

My suggestion is that we have a grand March for Mutation--1000 bodies
strong or more.  Like the war on cancer--but even more so--let's
declare a war on our selves and demand the right kind of change.  We
need to demand funding for genetic change, for DNA management, so that
our children will live in a better, peaceful world, where they can enjoy
great literature and recognize it for what it truly is.  I'd march for
that kind of REAL CHANGE.  How about you?  Jess

    from the book:

    How do our retinal experiences alter what we think we know about
alphabet? From minimal to maximal, the alphabet is explored and expanded on=
.
From the contextual aggregates and combinations of letters to the visual
elements that form a single letter. The visual poetry of alphabet insists
that writing is the drawing of what and how we think, and within that
writing, images accrue, the letters themselves, drawn, or otherwise printed=
,
are illustrating or reproducing our thought.



Nico Vassilakis appears before us a master of visual poetry, one of the few=
,
someone who understands the arrangement of letters into stareable sense, an
unsense of the breathing heart, and he appears before us speaking of visual
poetry as an act of making and seeing, speaking to us, speaking of himself,
showing through the pages of this vast but tiny poetics just what his
preaching practices, and the words are beautiful and teach of visual poetry
as a poetry as told to us through a poetic poetics, and the images of
letters, these dark and suppurating visual poems scattered through the text=
,
haunt us back into sleep, back into dreaming of the humped and crooked and
gracefully curving shapes of letters that have become an essential element
of our blood=97it is all here, where everything is of a piece and shattered
into pieces.

=97Geof Huth

Nico Vassilakis has created the perfect volume to delight and inspire the
full spectrum of a visual poetry audience, ranging from someone unaware of
the art, to the fully engaged, addicted practitioner of vispo. He delves
into the progressively crystalline elements of visual poetry: the word, the
letter, the fraction of a letter. The writing is brilliant; the visual
poetry, stunning. Staring is replete with pure discovery, rendered in
textual and visio-textual dimensions. Vassilakis recalls, reveals, and
spawns pure visual poetry, inspiring full attunement to an inventively
distilled magic.

=97Sheila E. Murphy

Wow! I attended the Avant Writing conference where Nico Vassilakis composed
staring@poetics and marvel how he is able to perform the formidable
multitasking of writing this long poem and illustrating it with stunningly
beautiful, computer generated, visual letter poems as his take on their
emotional, visual impact while remaining attentive to the many oral
presentations at this conference. But I shouldn=92t be surprised =96 I have
followed his poetic career for many years and found him to be one of the
most challenging, cutting-edge, American poets today. The long poem or the
visual poems are each worth the price of the book. This book deserves a
place in any library of contemporary poetry.

As the 150th birth anniversary of world poet Rabindranath Thakur (Tagore) is
celebrated around the world, especially in India and his hometown Kolkata,
Rabi is remembered as as artist who continues to cast a humongous shadow on
an entire people's social, cultural, musical, intellectual and artisitic
orientations. Few who know Tagore as a poet are also aware that his
contribution to Indian music was Mozartian, that a flourishing range of
songs based on his verse and music called "Rabindrasangeet" have been sung
in virtually every Bengali home for more than a century now; an equally
brilliant painter, a septuagenarian Tagore became great friends with the
German expressionists; that he was a virtuoso playwright, prolific essayist,
novelist, dramatist, educationist, philanthropist, talented singer,
stage-actor, specialized in doodlist art, the first short-story writer in an
Indian language, the first non-European to win the Nobel Prize for
Literature, collaborator of M. K. Gandhi as a messanger of world peace etc.
etc. The list goes on.


Here are some priceless resources to share today in his remembrance -

Subject:      Two Interesting Uses of the Term "Haptic Poetry"
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

Since I wrote the definition of Haptic poetry on Wikipedia in 2007, I've
been following the spread of its use among poets, artists and
technologists. I'm particularly happy to see it used in classes at
Stanford University and Eckard College.

I thought I'd share two of the most recent and most interesting projects.

Here's a link to "Final Wisdom I"--a Haptic Poetry Installation by the
intermedia artist John Filiwak and Donald Kuspit, a poet and art critic
from NYU Stony Brook.  http://idialab.org/projects/36

I'm most tickled by the New York based Louisiana artist Margaret
Evangeline's use of the term to describe her "Love Poems for Wet
Paint"--which she says is a continuation of her gunshot wounds in
stainless steel panel mode of creating art.  In the words of the artist
these works are "haptic poetry...odes to the savage sensation of
painting."

Here's the link to see Margaret Evangeline's interesting work:

THE CURSE OF THE 'CODE BLUE' MOTTO
http://netartery.vispo.com/?p=765
by Jim Andrews
The motto of the Canadian national junior hockey team in 2011 was "Code
Blue". Who knew that their motto would prove ironic? After the final  game,
did whoever thought up the motto for the Canadian juniors glimpse,  in a
kind of literary horror, the final meaning the motto would have in  history?

Hey,

My roommate is traveling in June, July and August.  We share a roomy, sunny
apartment in a great neighborhood (Kensington, Brooklyn) and we're looking
for someone who might be interested in subletting her half of the apartment
over the summer.  Our apartment is laid out in such a way that both of us
can have our privacy with my two rooms in the back of the apartment and a
large shared kitchen and full bath between us.  My roommate's very large,
sunny living/work space and a small bedroom in the front of the apartment is
available, from June 7th to August 20th, for only $700 a month. We are
looking for someone who is cat friendly because we have a friendly cat named
Hephaestus.  We are only two blocks from the F and G trains.  We are close
to the laundromat, supermarket, post office, the shopping district along
Church Avenue and only three subway stops from Park Slope.  I am a writer,
my roommate is a puppeteer, and we are looking for a mature, clean, quiet
woman to sublet her half of the apartment over the summer months. If you any
have questions or want to discuss this further please contact my roommate by
phone 718-853-7350 or email me at phipps.wanda@gmail.com.  If you know
someone who might be interested please feel free to pass along this info.

Best,
Wanda

Amsterdam's Versal launches its ninth edition
http://www.versaljournal.org

On April 28th, the ninth edition of Versal, the international literary and
art annual, was launched at SMART Project Space in Amsterdam in conjunction
with Literary Death Match. Described by Time Out Amsterdam as "beautifully
manicured", Versal 9 is the biggest, boldest, and most stunning issue to
date.

Antoinette Nausika=E4's striking art piece "I am happy" opens the 140-page
issue. Versal 9 also includes a special section dedicated to an as-yet
unseen work by Alice Notley, our first-ever insert (an art piece by
Paris-based UK artist Francene), and new writing from a myriad of today=B9s
most exciting voices, including Tony Mancus (USA), Maya Sarishvili
(Georgia), Heather Hartley (USA), Louis Armand (Australia), Yago Cura
(Argentina-USA), Lizzi Thistlethwayte (UK), and Stacy Kidd (USA).

Like its predecessors, Versal 9 is a calmly crafted yet filled-to-the-brim
journal that redefines the literary in print. It is now available at select
bookshops and online at www.versaljournal.org.



About Versal

Versal is published annually by the Amsterdam-based wordsinhere group, a
non-profit, volunteer-run organization for international writers living and
working in the Netherlands. Its editors hail from Canada, Russia, the UK,
the USA and the Netherlands, and are led by American poet Megan M. Garr.

A publication celebrating translocal intersections and cross-cultural
dialogue, Versal is internationally renowned for the quality of work
published by up-and-coming as well as established writers, and for its
strong attention to design and production values.

I like the part about mutation. But didn't Allen Tate and john Crowe Ransom=
 say the rest of this stuff in the 30s? Seems like a lot of folks at the mo=
ment are re-hashing these arguments from 80 (or 180) years ago. Maybe it's =

Subject: What good is great literature, etc. in Geo-Political Terms?  My Pr=
oposal for A MARCH FOR MUTATION=0A=
=0A=
Just had a stirring encounter on this topic with our favorite=0A=
multi-translator Sam Hamil.  We like Sam, and find his translations to=0A=
be ok--though we spent a good part of a year with an absolutely=0A=
brilliant, 70 year old grad student, who is a Tokyo patent attorney--a=0A=
native speaker--and linguist, taking a good look at his version of Oku=0A=
No Hosomichi and finding it somewhat inaccurate--even in the very=0A=
beginning passage.=0A=
=0A=
I lack Sam's spiritual pedigree too: I don't spout great wisdom from=0A=
the East that sounds suspiciously like bromides, I haven't guessed my=0A=
way in and around a Zen koan, or any of that stuff.  He likes to do=0A=
that, and I don't mind.=0A=
=0A=
But here's the point: I love great literature and I love Sam Hamil's=0A=
work, but I see no connection between great literature, great art, great=0A=
music, and the end to violence, fascism, genocide, human suffering of=0A=
all stripes, hunger, etc.; neither do I see it as the beginning of the=0A=
fight for equality of any sort, contentment among the masses of workers,=0A=
and a torch for those toiling on in darkness, etc.=0A=
=0A=
Reasonable people enjoy great literature because it presents at most=0A=
moments of clarity for them, manners of being, surprises in content and=0A=
style--memorable tropes.=0A=
=0A=
I would say that tyrants and despots are not the people who march in the=0A=
streets with reasonable people demanding social equality, change, the=0A=
end to all violence and universal peace.  I would say that even if=0A=
tyrants and despots read Jack Kerouac it would still not keep them from=0A=
being tyrants and despots. In addition, I believe that even if the=0A=
leaders of the free world end their day of leading the free-est of the=0A=
free worlds by reading Jack Kerouac, Byron's Don Juan, Erica Jong's=0A=
Fear of Flying, the Great Books from Chicago, etc. those leaders, and=0A=
those tyrants and despots would still reach for the nearest telephone to=0A=
call their soldiers, their police, or their operatives when it was time=0A=
for them to deal with their sense of the "real" world and its problems.=0A=
=0A=
My opinion, which I spelled out to Sam, but which he really didn't look=0A=
so closely at since he was busy telling me that one step is the=0A=
beginning of the journey of a thousand miles and that great literature=0A=
does make a difference in the world because he just knew that the Bible=0A=
and Jack Kerouac made a difference.  (He listed a few more.)=0A=
=0A=
But my point was that, yes, great literature makes a difference to=0A=
reasonable people like you--reading this posting right now--and Sam, and=0A=
me--Jess--but that marching, stomping and singing "All We Are Saying is=0A=
Give Peace A Chance" and Dostoevsky and Baudelaire, etc., doesn't make=0A=
a difference to anyone but people like us.  It tends to make us feel=0A=
better.  But if you look back over history you will see that culture and=0A=
great literature has always been worthless in the face of great violence=0A=
and great despair and great suffering.  We know that Hitler read Goethe=0A=
and Grabbe and listened to Beethoven, and that other evil Idiots like=0A=
Sadam of Iraq was well up on Gilgamesh and fancied himself a poet.  Yet=0A=
he still put men in wood chippers and watched them yell until they=0A=
couldn't any more.=0A=
=0A=
My thinking is that marching everywhere a million or a trillion strong is=
=0A=
good for us, and writing protest poetry, etc., is wonderful because=0A=
we're on the side of right.  We represent the apex of all things good,=0A=
so we should continue to make those feel-good gestures, but, honestly=0A=
folks, there's a logical disconnect here.  Great literature has been=0A=
with us for a long while and the powers that be are still violent.=0A=
We're still killing each other, still suffering in all kinds of ways.=0A=
I think Art and Culture and Literature have had a tremendous number of=0A=
chances to make a change.=0A=
=0A=
In addition, it seems that tyrants and despots and even leaders of the=0A=
free world are getting better at ignoring great literature, cultural=0A=
accomplishments, marches and protests--which they are developing the=0A=
technology to control, police, manage, and delete.=0A=
=0A=
What I said to Sam was that perhaps the only way to really "stop the=0A=
violence" was to change--not our ideas--but our fundamental natures so=0A=
that the old violent Homo Sapiens whose ancestors came out of Africa=0A=
with a yen for cooked meat and an ability to fashion stone tools of=0A=
ambiguous use--that Homo Sapiens that we now are--should be remade into=0A=
something other than ourselves.  The most efficient way to do it is=0A=
through science.  Prayer doesn't work.  We can't pray tyrants to=0A=
death. Singing doesn't work.  Woody Guthrie tried that and maybe Dylan=0A=
too. And anyway, tyrants and despots don't listen much to songs like=0A=
that.  Writing great books doesn't do it.  they'll just be remaindered=0A=
unless they're made into a movie with the latest heart throbs in it.  I=0A=
have no idea what forcing a Mugabi or a Khadaffi to read On the Road=0A=
would result in--but even though I'm guessing here--you hear me Sam,=0A=
I'm just guessing--I don't think it would help them help us achieve=0A=
the world peace that we sincerely seek.=0A=
=0A=
Only a mutation effected through genetic means--a little radiation beamed=
=0A=
at the old chromosomes at the right time--would maybe zap that violent=0A=
nature of ours in the most efficient manner.  Then all those potential=0A=
wielders of power in the future would not be violent.=0A=
=0A=
Then we could enjoy great literature and art without the illusion that=0A=
any of those activities that make us feel good about ourselves actually=0A=
does anything in this awful world of ours.=0A=
=0A=
My suggestion is that we have a grand March for Mutation--1000 bodies=0A=
strong or more.  Like the war on cancer--but even more so--let's=0A=
declare a war on our selves and demand the right kind of change.  We=0A=
need to demand funding for genetic change, for DNA management, so that=0A=
our children will live in a better, peaceful world, where they can enjoy=0A=
great literature and recognize it for what it truly is.  I'd march for=0A=
that kind of REAL CHANGE.  How about you?  Jess=0A=

Special Effects: Advances in Neurology by Neil Marcus

More than a document of the early days of the disability rights
movement, Neil Marcus' collection Special Effects: Advances in
Neurology is also a window into California zine culture of the 1980s.
Art in revolution: social justice, the human growth movement, art in
the everyday. From flourishing dystopia to speech storms, Neil
documents living artfully in Berkeley, California, and in Disability
Country.

Subject:      fwd; Phyllis Webb documentary by Robert McTavish on CBC Radio's
              IDEAS

A profile of Canada's great poet and the co-creator of the program IDEAS!
Phyllis Webb: The Art of Ideas on IDEAS on CBC Radio, 9pm Thursday, May
12th.

She has spent a lifetime asking questions. Her body of work was never
satisfied with the answers. Poet, anarchist, intellectual, former radio
producer, and co-creator of the program IDEAS, we honour Phyllis Webb in
this documentary by Robert McTavish.

Robert McTavish has done a number of radio and film documentaries,
including What to Make of it All? The life and poetry of John Newlove
(2006). He later edited the collection A Long Continual Argument: The
Selected Poems of John Newlove (Chaudiere Books 2007 with an afterword by
Jeff Derksen) which critic Steve Noyes described as "probably the best
summation of John Newlove's inimitable poems that we are likely to get"
and is currently producing and directing his fourth film, The Line Has
Shattered, on the 1963 Vancouver Poetry Conference.

The quadrivium comprised the four subjects, or arts, taught in medieval
universities after the trivium. The word is Latin, meaning "the four =
ways"
or "the four roads". Together, the trivium and the quadrivium comprised =
the
seven liberal arts.[1] The quadrivium consisted of arithmetic, geometry,
music, and astronomy. These followed the preparatory work of the trivium
made up of grammar, logic, and rhetoric. In turn, the quadrivium was
considered preparatory work for the serious study of philosophy and
theology. (Wikipedia)

*VLAK 2 will be launched on 15 May during the Prague Microfestival (
www.vlakmagazine.com). Copies can be ordered direct from the publisher at
www.litterariapragensia.com (under 'journals').


VLAK is an international curatorial project with a broad focus on
contemporary poetics, art, film, philosophy, music, science, design,
politics, performance, ecology, and new media.

Our global-local environment is defined by intersections, hybrids,
transversals: realities that are contested, interactual and always in the
process of taking new forms.

VLAK invites contributions that extend our understanding about what is
possible; which pose questions about the prevailing attitude of norms; whic=
h
explore the ramifications of contemporary culture and attempt new critical
and creative methods.

VLAK stands for the drive to experiment, to synthesise, to extend=E2=80=94h=
olding to
the principle that a vital culture is always experimental and thus always

Not that I know of. The person to talk to about this would probably be Jamie
Townsend. He did a Jacket feature on Samperi a couple years back and I
believe his thesis at Naropa was on Samperi as well. I know he's done
extensive research regardless.

Philosophy included the natural sciences.

The split dates to the professionalization of science and mathematics, in t=
he 19th century, but an educated person was expected to0 have studied mathe=
matics and the hard sciences until at least the mid-20th century, which is =
why they were required at almost all universities and colleges.

Station Hill (I think) did a selected a few years ago & the bigger books
that Grossman did in the 60s usually show up with book dealers. There is
now a website set up by family, so maybe there is a move to getting
unpublished manuscripts out and the like.

THE WILLOW'S WHISPER :
A Transatlantic Compilation of
Poetry from Ireland & Native America

"This thought provoking and imaginative anthology brings poems and
poets from diverse sociolinguistic and cultural traditions together
into dialogue.  Central yet marginalized within their respective
discourses, the genus of this anthology is to change the dominant
focus.  By pairing these =91non-canonical=92 texts, this anthology opens
new vistas, and makes new connections amplifying human and cultural
concerns all too often lost in the official Anglo-American literary
and cultural canon."

THE WILLOW'S WHISPER
(Cambridge Scholars Publishing)
edited by Jill O=92Mahony &

launched on Friday 13 May 2011
at 7:00 p.m. in
The Book Centre,
25 Barronstrand Street,
Waterford, Ireland.

THE WILLOW'S WHISPER brings the voices of 35 poets from the Irish and
Native American communities together in one compilation.  This
collection of poems provides an aesthetic commentary on the potential
which is beyond and within the everyday.  From Gabriel Rosenstock and
Biddy Jenkinson to N. Scott Momaday and Karenne Wood, and from Joy
Harjo to Paddy Bushe and Biddy Jenkinson, this compilation showcases
poetry from the finest poets in both communities.

Native America and Ireland : you might ask ...

What are the commonalities?

Furthermore : why bring them together through poetry?

Instead of replacing retirees with new tenure-eligible hires=

EXCERPTS:=0A=0AInstead of replacing retirees with new tenure-eligible hires=
, =0Adepartments gradually shifted the teaching load to part-timers: =0Aadj=
uncts, postdocs, graduate students. From 1991 to 2003, the number of =0Aful=
l-time faculty members increased by 18 percent. The number of =0Apart-timer=
s increased by 87 percent=E2=80=94to almost half the entire faculty. =0A=0A=
=0ABut as Jack Schuster and Martin Finkelstein point out in their comprehen=
sive study The American Faculty (2006), the move to part-time labor is alre=
ady an old story. Less =0Avisible but equally important has been the advent=
 and rapid expansion of full-time positions that are not tenure-eligible. N=
o one talks about this transformation=E2=80=94the creation of yet another a=
cademic =0Aunderclass=E2=80=94and yet as far back as 1993, such positions a=
lready =0Aconstituted the majority of new appointees. As of 2003, more than=
 a =0Athird of full-time faculty were working off the tenure track. By the =
=0Asame year, tenure-track professors=E2=80=94the =E2=80=9Cnormal=E2=80=9D =
kind of academic =0Aappointment=E2=80=94represented no more than 35 percent=
 of the American faculty.=0A=0AThe reasons for these trends can be expresse=
d in a single word, or =0Abuzzword: efficiency. Contingent academic labor, =
as non-tenure-track =0Afaculty, part-time and full-time, are formally known=
, is cheaper to hire and easier to fire. It saves departments money and giv=
es them greater =0Aflexibility in staffing courses. Over the past twenty ye=
ars, in other =0Awords=E2=80=94or really, over the past forty=E2=80=94what =
has happened in academia is =0Awhat has happened throughout the American ec=
onomy. Good, secure, =0Awell-paid positions=E2=80=94tenured appointments in=
 the academy, union jobs on =0Athe factory floor=E2=80=94are being replaced=
 by temporary, low-wage employment.=0A=0A* * *=0A=0AThey=E2=80=99re doing e=
xactly what we always complain our brightest students =0Adon=E2=80=99t do: =
eschewing the easy bucks of Wall Street, consulting or =0Acorporate law to =
pursue their ideals and be of service to society. =0AAcademia may once have=
 been a cushy gig, but now we=E2=80=99re talking about =0Ahighly talented y=
oung people who are willing to spend their 20s living =0Aon subsistence wag=
es when they could be getting rich (and their friends are getting rich), si=
mply because they believe in knowledge, ideas, inquiry; in =0Ateaching, in =
following their passion. To leave more than half of them =0Aholding the bag=
 at the end of it all, over 30 and having to scrounge for a new career, is =
a human tragedy. =0A=0A=0ASure, lots of people have it worse. But here=E2=
=80=99s another reason to =0Acare: it=E2=80=99s also a social tragedy, and =
not just because it represents a =0Acolossal waste of human capital. If we =
don=E2=80=99t make things better for the =0Apeople entering academia, no on=
e=E2=80=99s going to want to do it anymore. And =0Athen it won=E2=80=99t ju=
st be the students who are suffering. Scholarship will =0Asuffer, which mea=
ns the whole country will. Knowledge, as we=E2=80=99re =0Aconstantly told, =
is a nation=E2=80=99s most important resource, and the great =0Amajority of=
 knowledge is created in the academy=E2=80=94now more than ever, in =0Afact=
, since industry is increasingly outsourcing research to =0Auniversities wh=
ere, precisely because graduate students cost less than =0Asomeone who gets=
 a real salary, it can be conducted on the cheap. (Bell =0ALabs, once the f=
lagship of industrial science, is a shell of its former =0Aself, having suf=
fered years of cutbacks before giving up on fundamental =0Aresearch altoget=
her.)=0A=0AIt isn=E2=80=99t just the sciences that matter; it is also the s=
ocial =0Asciences and the humanities. And it isn=E2=80=99t just the latter =
that are =0Asuffering. Basic physics in this country is all but dead. From =
1971 to =0A2001, the number of bachelor=E2=80=99s degrees awarded in Englis=
h declined by 20 percent, but the number awarded in math and statistics dec=
lined by 55 =0Apercent. The only areas of the liberal arts that saw an incr=
ease in BAs =0Aawarded were biology and psychology=E2=80=94and this at a ti=
me when aggregate =0Aenrollment expanded by something like 75 percent. On t=
he work that is =0Adone in the academy depends the strength of our economy,=
 our public =0Apolicy and our culture. We need our best young minds going i=
nto =0Aatmospheric research and international affairs and religious studies=
, =0Achemistry and ethnography and art history. By pursuing their individua=
l =0Ainterests, narrowly understood, departments are betraying both the =0A=
values they are pledged to uphold=E2=80=94the pursuit of knowledge, the spi=
rit =0Aof critical inquiry, the extension of the humanistic tradition=E2=80=
=94and the =0Anation they exist to serve.=0A=0A=0A* * *=0A=0AWhat we have s=
een instead over the past forty years, in addition to the =0Araising of a r=
eserve army of contingent labor, is a kind of =0Aadministrative elephantias=
is, an explosion in the number of people =0Aworking at colleges and univers=
ities who aren=E2=80=99t faculty, full-time or =0Apart-time, of any kind. F=
rom 1976 to 2001, the number of nonfaculty =0Aprofessionals ballooned nearl=
y 240 percent, growing more than three =0Atimes as fast as the faculty. Coa=
ching staffs and salaries have grown =0Awithout limit; athletic departments=
 are virtually separate colleges =0Awithin universities now, competing (suc=
cessfully) with academics. The =0Asize of presidential salaries=E2=80=94mor=
e than $1 million in several dozen =0Acases=E2=80=94has become notorious. N=
or is it only the presidents; the next six =0Amost highly paid administrati=
ve officers at Yale averaged over $430,000 =0Ain 2007. As Gaye Tuchman expl=
ains in Wannabe U (2009), a case =0Astudy in the sorrows of academic corpor=
atization, deans, provosts and =0Apresidents are no longer professors who c=
ycle through administrative =0Aduties and then return to teaching and resea=
rch. Instead, they have =0Abecome a separate stratum of managerial careeris=
ts, jumping from job to =0Ajob and organization to organization like any ot=
her executive: isolated =0Afrom the faculty and its values, loyal to an eth=
os of short-term =0Aexpansion, and trading in the business blather of measu=
rability, revenue streams, mission statements and the like. They do not hav=
e the =0Along-term health of their institutions at heart. They want to pump=
 up =0Athe stock price (i.e., U.S. News and World Report ranking) and move =
on to the next fat post.=0A=0A* * *=0A=0AWhat we have in academia, in other=
 words, is a microcosm of the =0AAmerican economy as a whole: a self-enrich=
ing aristocracy, a swelling =0Aand increasingly immiserated proletariat, an=
d a shrinking middle class. =0AThe same devil=E2=80=99s bargain stabilizes =
the system: the middle, or at least =0Athe upper middle, the tenured profes=
soriate, is allowed to retain its =0Aprerogatives=E2=80=94its comfortable c=
ompensation packages, its workplace =0Aautonomy and its job security=E2=80=
=94in return for acquiescing to the =0Aexploitation of the bottom by the to=
p, and indirectly, the betrayal of =0Athe future of the entire enterprise.=
=0A=0A* * *=0A=0ABut the tenure system, which is already being eroded by th=
e growth of =0Acontingent labor, is not the only thing that is under assaul=
t in the =0Atop-down, corporatized academy. As Cary Nelson explains in No U=
niversity Is an Island (2010), shared governance=E2=80=94the principle that=
 universities should be =0Acontrolled by their faculties, which protects ac=
ademic values against =0Athe encroachments of the spreadsheet brigade=E2=80=
=94is also threatened by the =0Achanging structure of academic work. Contin=
gent labor undermines it both directly=E2=80=94no one asks an adjunct what =
he thinks of how things run=E2=80=94and =0Aindirectly. More people chasing =
fewer jobs means that everyone is =0Asqueezed for extra productivity, just =
like at Wal-Mart. As of 1998, =0Afaculty at four-year schools worked an ave=
rage of about seven hours more per week than they had in 1972 (for a total =
of more than forty-nine =0Ahours a week; the stereotype of the lazy academi=
c is, like that of the =0Awelfare queen, a politically useful myth). Not su=
rprisingly, they also =0Areported a shrinking sense of influence over campu=
s affairs. Who=E2=80=99s got =0Athe time? Academic labor is becoming like e=
very other part of the =0AAmerican workforce: cowed, harried, docile, disem=
powered.=0A=0AIn macropolitical terms, the erosion of tenure and shared gov=
ernance =0Aundermines the power of a large body of liberal professionals. I=
n this =0Ait resembles the campaign against teachers unions. Tenure, in fac=
t, is a lot like unionization: imperfect, open to corruption and abuse, but=
 =0Aincomparably better than the alternative. Indeed, tenure is what =0Apro=
fessors have instead of unions (at least at private universities, =0Awhere =
they=E2=80=99re banned by law from organizing). As for shared governance, =
=0Ait is nothing other than one of the longest-standing goals of the left: =
=0Aemployee control of the workplace. Yes, professors have it better than a=
 lot of other workers, including a lot of others in the academy. But the an=
swer, for the less advantaged, is to organize against the employers =0Awho=
=E2=80=99ve created the situation, not drag down the relatively privileged =
=0Aworkers who aren=E2=80=99t yet suffering as badly: to level up, in other=
 words, =0Anot down.=0A=0A=0A=0AHere we come to the most important issue fa=
cing American higher =0Aeducation. Public institutions enroll about three-q=
uarters of the =0Anation=E2=80=99s college students, and public institution=
s are everywhere under =0Afinancial attack. As Nancy Folbre explains in Sav=
ing State U (2010), a short, sharp, lucid account, spending on higher educa=
tion has =0Abeen falling as a percentage of state budgets for more than twe=
nty =0Ayears, to about two-thirds of what it was in 1980. The average six-y=
ear =0Agraduation rate at state schools is now a dismal 60 percent, a funct=
ion =0Aof class size and availability, faculty accessibility, the use of =
=0Acontingent instructors and other budget-related issues. Private =0Aunive=
rsities actually lobby against public funding for state schools, =0Awhich t=
hey see as competitors. In any case, a large portion of state =0Ascholarshi=
p aid goes to students at private colleges (in some cases, =0Amore than hal=
f)=E2=80=94a kind of voucher system for higher education.=0A=0AMeanwhile, p=
ublic universities have been shifting their financial aid criteria from nee=
d to merit to attract applicants with higher scores =0A(good old U.S. News =
again), who tend to come from wealthier =0Afamilies. Per-family costs at st=
ate schools have soared in recent years, from 18 percent of income for thos=
e in the middle of the income =0Adistribution in 1999 to 25 percent in 2007=
. Estimates are that over the =0Apast decade, between 1.4 million and 2.4 m=
illion students have been =0Aprevented from going to college for financial =
reasons=E2=80=94about 50 percent =0Amore than during the 1990s. And of cour=
se, in the present climate of =0Auniversal fiscal crisis, it is all about t=
o get a lot worse.=0A=0A* * *=0A=0AMy state of Oregon, a chronic economic u=
nderperformer, has difficulty =0Aattracting investment, not because its cor=
porate taxes are high=E2=80=94they=E2=80=99re =0Aamong the lowest=E2=80=94b=
ut because its workforce is poorly educated. So it =0Awill be for the natio=
n as a whole. Our college-completion rate has =0Afallen from second to eigh=
th. And we are not just defunding instruction; we are defunding research, t=
he creation of knowledge itself.=0A=0A* * *=0A=0AYet the liberal arts, as w=
e know, are dying. All the political and =0Aparental pressure is pushing in=
 the other direction, toward the =0A=E2=80=9Cpractical,=E2=80=9D narrowly c=
onceived: the instrumental, the utilitarian, the =0Aimmediately negotiable.=
 Colleges and universities are moving away from =0Athe liberal arts toward =
professional, technical and vocational training. Last year, the State Unive=
rsity of New York at Albany announced plans =0Ato close its departments of =
French, Italian, Russian, classics and =0Atheater=E2=80=94a wholesale slaug=
hter of the humanities. When Garland enumerates the fields a state legislat=
ure might want to encourage its young people to enter, he lists =E2=80=9Cen=
gineering, agriculture, nursing, math and science education, or any other a=
rea of state importance.=E2=80=9D Apparently political science, philosophy,=
 history and anthropology, among others, are not =0Aareas of state importan=
ce. Zemsky wants to consider reducing college to =0Athree years=E2=80=94mea=
ning less time for young people to figure out what to =0Astudy, to take cou=
rses in a wide range of disciplines, to explore, to =0Amature, to think.=0A=
=0AWhen politicians, from Barack Obama all the way down, talk about higher =
=0Aeducation, they talk almost exclusively about math and science. Indeed, =
=0Atechnology creates the future. But it is not enough to create the =0Afut=
ure. We also need to organize it, as the social sciences enable us to do. W=
e need to make sense of it, as the humanities enable us to do. A =0Asystem =
of higher education that ignores the liberal arts, as Jonathan =0ACole poin=
ts out in The Great American University (2009), is =0Awhat they have in Chi=
na, where they don=E2=80=99t want people to think about =0Aother ways to ar=
range society or other meanings than the authorized =0Aones. A scientific e=
ducation creates technologists. A liberal arts =0Aeducation creates citizen=
s: people who can think broadly and critically =0Aabout themselves and the =
world.=0A=0ABut leadership will have to come from somewhere else, as well. =
Just as =0Ain society as a whole, the academic upper middle class needs to =
rethink =0Aits alliances. Its dignity will not survive forever if it doesn=
=E2=80=99t fight =0Afor that of everyone below it in the academic hierarchy=
. (=E2=80=9CFirst they =0Acame for the graduate students, and I didn=E2=80=
=99t speak out because I wasn=E2=80=99t a graduate student=E2=80=A6=E2=80=
=9D) For all its pretensions to public importance (every professor secretly=
 thinks he=E2=80=99s a public intellectual), the =0Aprofessoriate is awfull=
y quiet, essentially nonexistent as a collective =0Avoice. If academia is g=
oing to once again become a decent place to work, if our best young minds a=
re going to be attracted back to the =0Aprofession, if higher education is =
going to be reclaimed as part of the =0AAmerican promise, if teaching and r=
esearch are going to make the country strong again, then professors need to=
 get off their backsides and =0Aorganize: department by department, institu=
tion to institution, state by state and across the nation as a whole. Tenur=

Alex Danchev's _100 Artists' Manifestos From the Futurists to the
Stuckists_ (London: Penguin, 2011) hasn't yet been published in the
United States, so far as I'm aware, but I was able to order it without
any difficulty from one of Amazon.com's associates. It constitutes a
useful history of modernism -- one written in primary documents and
Oulipian exclamation marks. For an example of what might be done with
it, see my expanded quotation at

http://theartpart.jonathanmorse.net/?p=169

On a different subject, I also expand a quotation from Susan Schultz's

PUSH is thrilled to announce

the Second Volume of Kevin Killian's Amazon Reviews is now available

http://push-press.blogspot.com/2011/05/kevin-killians-selected-amazon-revie=
ws_09.html



Following a sold out "Volume One," Kevin Killian brings forth "Volume Two o=
f
Selected Amazon Reviews," featuring a higher percentage of =93serious=94 re=
views
than "Volume One," which showcased the surreal and carnivalesque. Killian
understood that on Amazon, everything=92s for sale, and everyone=92s an unp=
aid
content provider. However, as he discovered, you can also say almost exactl=
y
what you want, chip away at the machine, and maybe do it some harm.

8" x 8", 45 pages of reviews (including reviews of Eileen Myles, the
photography of Jonathan Williams, Copper Fire Bowls, Barthes, Bourdieu,
Advil, and an Italian Charm Bracelet), with cover art by Ryan Coffey.
Edition of 200


eight bucks includes shipping

"Inside the Skull-House" is a project of Digital Literary Art  that was =
made from 1998 to 2002, here newly revised to give it a more cohesive =
presence as the medium develops larger, and smaller, formats.
In a journal of 223 pages, or screens, with links to paratexts that =
offer neuroscientific, and other, references, it addresses eleven major =
areas of the brain that serve to make a mind.=20
There is also my trope of "invagination" (interruptions to the flow of =
the text with deeper voices), along with still images and animations:

FRIDAY NIGHT

  by Mary Eliza Crane

=20

With a flash of light

an eagle splits

the seamless gray

of sky

and river in the rain.

=20

At your house

I find the key on a dusty beam

and put on tea.

Coals in the stove stirred,

I feed them white grain alder

uprooted from another winter

and dried to perfection

in a blazing summer sun.

Quiet taps of heat expanding glowing flames

against the dark red walls

and deep into the blackness of the night.

Clothes peeled,

I add two more blankets to my side

and burrow down with steaming mug and book

into the soft gold light.

=20

I dissolve into the echo of the rain upon the roof.

=20

By what unlikely stroke of grace

did this become my life?

Sisters by Liz Dolan

Liz Dolan's first poetry collection, They Abide, was recently published by
March Street Press. Her second poetry manuscript, A Secret of Long Life,
is ready to go and in need of a publisher. She has been published in On
the Mason-Dixon Line: An Anthology of Contemporary Delaware Writers and
has also won a $6,000 established artist fellowship from the Delaware
Division of the Arts, 2009. Liz is most proud of the offsite school she
ran in The Bronx and her nine grandchildren who live on the next block in
Rehoboth. "They pepper my life," she says.

Spread the word. Far and wide,

William Slaughter

Dear All,


Apologies for cross-posting.


I'm delighted to announce a reading and paper by Keston Sutherland in
Sheffield. I hope you'll  feel free to come along.


I'm not yet fully in the know about lines of communication in Sheffield and
Yorkshire and, etc., so if anyone knows of good email lists/online forums t=
o
post news of readings, I'd appreciate it if they could let me know.


Yours truly,

*Sutherland=92s poetry is =93wired to every possible source and sink of
information in a world where truth equals shit at the very moment when the
elastic snaps, leaving us with a face full of spare ribs and throat
gristle.  It's one of the most astonishing collaborations of mind and
material I've ever known.  And so is Keston.=94 *

About Keston Sutherland:



Keston Sutherland is one of the few best poets. He has now qualified as a
Reader at the University of Sussex. He is the editor of avant-garde journal
*Quid* and, with Andrea Brady, the astonishing Barque Press (
www.barquepress.com). *Sutherland=92s poetry collections include **The Stat=
s
on Infinity**, **Stress Position, Hot White Andy, Neocosis, Neutrality**, *=
*The
Rictus Flag**,** **and **Antifreeze**. His work has been translated into
French, German, and Chinese. Scholars continue to work on the English. He
gets invited all over the world to read poems, which is nice. *Sutherland=
=92s
forthcoming critical work is *Stupefaction: A Radical Anatomy of
Phantoms *(Seagull/University
of Chicago).



=93From Shakespeare to Beckett, the contradictory figure of the fool who
possesses unexpected wisdom has been a popular and effective literary trope
and rhetorical figure for centuries. Philosophy needs idiots too, argues
Keston Sutherland in Stupefaction. This is a book about how idiots are
created, how they are used, and the types of truth that depend on them.

             Sutherland examines how speculative and satirical descriptions
of stupidity function in art and in argument. His examples include Alexande=
r
Pope=92s dunce, Adorno=92s philistine, Wordsworth=92s mechanical adopter of=
 poetic
diction, and phenomenologist Michel Henry=92s drunkard who rides an escalat=
or
to nothingness. Sutherland also provides an important new account of the
figure of the bourgeois in Marx and a powerfully original interpretation of
commodity fetishism as a satire against bourgeois objectivity. This unusual
analysis of the trope of the idiot will appeal to scholars of literature an=
d
philosophy alike.=94



Some of the highlights of his critical writings include:

Performance selections Now Online!
Six performance Videos of the ribald dramatic monologues of
"The story God & Mel Gibson don't want you to hear!!"

http://www.flashpointmag.com/carloparcelli.htm

Poet Vaudevillian Carlo Parcelli performs selections in costume from
The
Canaanite Gospel: A Meditation on Empire

In the classical argots of Petronius, Rabelais, Chaucer, Shakespeare,
Lenny Bruce, Guy Ritchie, James Joyce, David Jones, Cockney and the
world's myriad cryptolects, The Canaanite Gospel strips bare the New
Testament canard of the Resurrection of Yeshu of Nazareth and pokes a
stick in the eye of the Synoptic Gospels. Culled from First Century
Texts and drawn from dozens of biblical and secular sources, these
monologues tell a revisionist tale of what transpired in Judea, Easter

Week/Passover 33 AD and beyond during the reign of the Roman Emperor
Tiberius.

That's a pretty extraordinary oversight. Maybe the younguns are trying to convince us that they know how to read?

A reasobnable complaint. There are a whole lot of folks in the immediate area who could supply the lived context. Must be more fun to piece it together from the internet.

The 60s have become a field of study, usually by folks who weren't there. Strange how quickly the very recent becomes irretrievably historic.

Best,

Mark

Walasse Ting the painter died a year ago today (17 May). Apart from =
being a painter, he was also a poet. His poetry is hard to find because =
its all hidden away in art books. There does not seem to be a collection =
available in English, although there is a translated collection into =
Dutch.

Here are a few of his poems, to celebrate his life / death. I find him =
inspiring in the way that Nanao Sakaki and Franco Beltrametti are =
inspiring. Their writing genuinely free form.

These poems are taken from two books:=20
Red Mouth (Toppan printing Hong Kong, 1977) and=20
A Very Hot Day (Shanghai Art Museum, 1997)



A very hot day


I bought a piece of floral fabric
I dry my sweat with the fabric
And so many butterflies jump out of the cloth
They fly away into the blue sky
They don=92t even say goodbye




Spring=20

Spring arrives
The angels come down from the sky
They turn into bunches of roses, tulips, peonies, cherry blossoms,
Camelias and chrysanthemums
In the valley, fresh flowers are everywhere
Angels come here to have a party
Next time you are on the street, go buy a dozen roses
Bring them home, and don=92t forget you have 12 angels with you,
to watch t.v. with you

Hello beautiful readers,

First off, /Unlikely Stories of the Third Kind/ is being, once again,
printed. If you are waiting on a copy, now is a good time to write to me
at jonathan@unlikelystories.org and tell me.

Second, we've got a sweet new mini-issue up at www.UnlikelyStories.org!
Check out:
Seven Drawings and Paintings by Simon Coates
and Part One of a two-month series of the Mixed-Media Visual Art of Don
Cato!

And hey! Are you reading the Unlikely Blog at
http://www.unlikelystories.org/blog/ ? Gabriel Ricard has been tearing
that up, with new reviews of Lawrence Barrett, Wayne Crawford, Vernon
Frazer, Jonathan Hayes, Gene Keller, Pat Nolan, Logan Phillips, Marthe
Reed, and F. Richard Thomas!

Now, we'd like to thank and congratulate Dustin Luke Nelson, our Music
Editor, who's new InDigest Press is really taking off. An outgrowth of
www.InDigestMag.com, it's an exciting, ambitious new press for serious
lovers of literature. Unfortunately, it has put him in a time crunch,
and he's having to step down as our Music Editor. So we're now looking
for someone new to fill that spot -- please just drop me a line!

THE AISLING PROJECT

presented by IMRAM in association

The aisling - or vision poem =96 is a poetic form that developed during
the late 17th and 18th centuries.  In an aisling, Ireland appears to
the poet in a vision or dream in the form of a woman, sometimes young
and beautiful, sometimes aged and haggard.  This figure is referred to
in the poems as a sp=E9irbhean.  She laments the state of the Irish
people and predicts an imminent renewal of their fortunes, frequently
linked to the return of a Stuart pretender to the English throne.  The
first and greatest of the aisling poets was Aodhag=E1n =D3 Rathaille -
athair na haislinge (father of the aisling). In his hands, the aisling
was a powerful mode of political writing.


On Tuesday 24 May 2011, at 8:00 p.m., IMRAM with the Dublin Writers'
Festival will stage a major reading in which leading Irish language
poets Paddy Bushe, Gear=F3id Mac Lochlainn and Dairena N=ED Chinn=E9ide
perform newly composed poems in the aisling form addressing the
current state of Ireland.  These poems will be performed with
specially composed live music by acclaimed composer and
multi-instrumentalist Se=E1n =D3g McErlane, and on-screen projections by
artist Margaret Lonergan.

This event is curated by Liam Carson, director of the IMRAM Irish
Language Literature Festival.

In vision,

Hi,

In a little over two months, to mark our 20th anniversary, we'll be
putting on our fifth annual Welcome to Boog City poetry and music
festival, featuring poets, musicians, and playwrights performing at
four venues, in two boroughs, over five days, from Fri. Aug. 5-Tues.
Aug. 9. Among the over 50 performers taking part are poets Cara
Benson, Charles Borkhuis, Lee Ann Brown, Bruce Covey, Alan Gilbert,
Brenda Iijima, Ish Klein, Mark Lamoureux, Tanya Larkin, Douglas
Piccininni, Kimberly Ann Southwick, Mary Austin Speaker, and Jill
Stengel.

Ten days before the event, we'll be putting out the festival issue of
Boog City. This issue will feature pieces on some of the performers
and a full schedule, illustrated with images of each of the performers.

Advertising in the festival issue of Boog City means you will reach
more than 3,000 readers, poetry lovers, and small press aficionados
throughout the East Village, other targeted areas of lower Manhattan;
Williamsburg and Greenpoint, Brooklyn; as well as bonus distribution
at Boog City events. That's an increase of 33.3% over our regular
issues for no additional cost. And, since this issue is also a program
for the festival, readers will give it a closer read as they check to
see who's up later on that day and throughout the festival.

Boog City continues to offer our special Small Press Ad Rates. That
means when you advertise with us you will save 50% off of our regular
display ad rates.

      * Full Page        $250
      * Half-Page       $130
      * Quarter-Page   $70
      * Eighth-Page     $40

Here is a link to our full rate card:

http://boogcity.com/ad-rates.pdf

As I mentioned in previous emails to you, Boog City focuses on getting
the word out about lesser-known artists, be they poets, prose writers,
musicians, painters, photographers, or cartoonists. Each month we
publish poetry from the likes of Anselm Berrigan, Renee Gladman, Lisa
Jarnot, Eileen Myles, Kristin Prevallet, and Edwin Torres, alongside
our Urban Folk music section, small press book reviews, political
commentary, art, comics, and photographs.

We look forward to working with you to bring your message to the local
arts community to increase awareness and sales of your publications in
the New York area.

as ever,
David

*To receive a PDF of Uncertainties for review consideration, please email

Here is Robert Kelly's condensed yet vastly applicable and available poetic
statement on *Uncertainties*:

"Call and response.  The breathing body of poetry from the beginning. The
psalms of David, the wave of them, rise and fall of plainchant, verse and
response.  The constantly shifting pause between the half-lines of Old
English poetry and the poems of the Edda, the half-lines of the Kalevala
swayed out four-handed on the saga bench.  So I thought towards the two-lin=
e
stanza as experiments in duration, in complex syntactic and melodic
demands.  The melody of the first line necessitates the melody of the next.
Shape shaping shape.  Formally, the poem engages with one constraint:  each
line wants to be semantically intact=97ideally, any line could stand alone,=
 be
my Last Words, my epitaph.  Yet it also must link syntactically or
narratively with the line that follows.  And each stanza must stand in like
relation with the stanzas before and after.  This requirement extends to
line structure something that I=92ve worked with for years (usually
furtively): hypersyntax, where phrases link with what comes before or after=
,
or plausibly stand alone.  Uncertainties tries to use these strategies in
'mental strife,' to solicit the dissolving of certainties=97in between the
inbreath and the outbreath, where nothing is fixed, and freedom begins."

Poet and fiction writer,* Robert Kelly* was born in 1935 in Brooklyn, and
educated at CCNY and Columbia, where he studied mediaeval literature and
linguistics.  His first book, *Armed Descent*, was published in 1961; since
then he has published over sixty more,  most recently the novel *The Book
from the Sky*, the long poem *Fire Exit,* and his fifth collection of short
stories*, The Logic of the World*.  He has been especially interested in
collaborations with artists (*The Garden of Distances, Shame*) and other
poets (*Mont Blanc, Unquell the Dawn Now*).  He was a founder of *Chelsea *
and* Trobar, *and an editor of* Caterpillar, Alcheringa, *and *Conjunctions=
*
.  He is the Asher B. Edelman Professor of Literature at Bard College, wher=
e
he started the writing program in the Milton Avery Graduate School.  He
co-directs the Program in Written Arts.  He lives in the Hudson Valley with
his wife, the translator Charlotte Mandell.

POET AS RADIO is a new, weekly program on KUSF In Exile, airing Saturdays f=
rom 9am to 10am at http://www.savekusf.org. Jack Spicer said that the poet =
is not a creator, but a conduit, getting messages from an undefinable sourc=
e to form the poem. He thought of a poet as a radio, broadcasting words. We=
 like to think of POET AS RADIO as an opportunity for writers to broadcast =
their words as well.=20

I  am currently compiling information for an article on improvisation in co=
ntemporary poetry, and would be interested in the names of people currently=
 using improvisatory strategies in poetry performance, either by improvisin=
g with words or with the voice or both. I co-wrote a book in the nineties a=
bout improvisation in the arts  in which I discussed  poets  like Antin, Be=
nson, Cobbing, Paula Claire and cris cheek, and other poets  and musicians =
involved in the text-sound movement,  but what I am mainly enquiring about =
here is  a new generation of people  who may be involved with improvisation=
 in poetry now (or have been recently) and whose work and outlook may be ve=
ry different.

 I am interested in people using computer-based text generation too, but I =
already have quite a stack of information about that, and the practitioners=
 and their practices are easier to locate.

If you have ideas about people who are engaging  in improvised poetry perfo=
rmance I'd be interested to hear about them either through the list or back=
channel (and if you are such a person maybe you can declare yourself to me!=
) My focus is international.
Thanks!

"The Silence of Sasquatch" continues my redesiging of past projects in =
order to better anticipate future electronic displays. I've also tried =
to simplfy the work, appreciating more the dynamics of reading on a =
screen as opposed to on paper.
Originally made during 2003-2004, "The Silence of Sasquatch" elaborates =
the creature, "part-animal, part-human who can hypnotize, ventriloquise, =
make himself invisible," who has been recorded, mythically or not, in =
many places of the world.

American?  Which "way"  -- in U.S., Zen and Tibetan are most common?  Though
I think a lot of Theravadan flies under the radar, at least in the U.S.

Practicing Buddhist writers or those influenced by, among other things,
Buddhism, in its many flavors?

Also, pls. *front channel* these --

All best,

Morgan Gibson's translations of Kukai's poetry fit the bill.  If you
can't find a copy I'd be happy to send.

Translations of the greats by Burton Watson.

I suppose Sam Hamil's work.

Philip Whalen.

There's an old Penguin Anthology of Zen Poetry, and another book out
there of Zen Death poems.  (If you think Buddhism=Zen)

I think Shakespeare is a great Buddhist poet--one of the absolute
non-dualists.  Why don't you give him a try?  He was a

Hey, everyone,

I'm tempted to ask publishers, as well as writers, how they go about
promoting and marketing their books, what resources they use, if the weight
of promotions rests on the writer or the publishers. This is in regard to
promotions across the country.

I'm having a difficult time getting people to review furniture press books,
and I have a feeling I'm not looking in the right places. This doesn't
necessarily hinder our sales. But I'd like to see more buzz around my
writers' books. I think they deserve more than just the wesbite and SPD. I'm
very interesting, even, in hearing from people who have read the books and
have had a good response, and who are not necessarily reviewers.

Does anyone want to input on this? Advice, resources, etc?

To Cheryl, for her class:

E ma!
This extraordinary wilderness!
Here, where so many learned and
accomplished lamas have stayed,
The gathering-place of dakinis and dharmapalas,
Is the place where I stay in solitude.

Tseshung, this secluded mountain place
Above--a slow, soft rain drizzles down.
Flocks of eagles flying--north, south--
Beaked mothers and their young
Trying their wings--Rainbows vividly appear.

Below me--the curved necks of geese,
Glancing, and the Tsechu River flowing
on,
Sinuous.  Behind them, deer dance on the
slope
Of a mountain whose peak penetrates
space.

On both sides, meadows blaze with wild
flowers;
Myriad bees whirls above them.
In front, rocks ornament the mountain meadows;
A cuckoo's cry fills me with sadness.

Up and down the valley, cattle and sheep
Owned by the faithful
Dot the land.  The young girls
Watching over them are busy,
Making up songs and plays and dances.

Today I climbed behind
This excellent retreat place,
Looking down on such charming scenes
From the mountain's summit.

I raised my head, looking up,
And saw the cloudless sky.

I thought of absolute space, free from
limits,
The view of dharmadhatu.
I then experienced a freedom
Without center, without end--
All biased views
Completely abandoned.

I lowered my head to look in front of me,
And saw the sun of this world.

I thought of meditation--
Luminous and unobscured.
I then experienced a nondual empty
clarity.
All meditations that focus the mind
I completely abandoned.

I turned my head, looking south,
And saw a pattern of rainbows.

I thought of all phenomena--
At once both apparent and empty.
I then experienced a natural clarity beyond
duality.
All nihilist and eternalist viewpoints
Completely abandoned.

Looking above, looking below,
Looking in all directions,
I saw the world and the beings in it--
All reliant on space.

I thought of fruition that is inherent and
naturally present.
I experienced a state beyond accepting or
rejecting--
Hope of results and fear of failure
I completely abandoned.

Many smaller publishers no longer produce or distribute hard copy galleys
for reviews in advance of publication; that automatically eliminates most
titles from consideration for reviews at most of the highest visibility
reviews.

All best,
Catherine

hi christopher

i like to have my own books reviewed - so i feel the onus is on me as write=
r - to ask journals=2C reviewers ..

if i get a positive response from someone i might ask if theyd like to revi=
ew it - its not so much about the positivity you understand as the engageme=
nt - so far noones ever emailed me to say how they hate my books - tho some=
 surely do -

it felt more of an issue with my anthology (ie as an editor) as i wanted at=
tention for the other writers - & for gay /lesbian to be acknowledged as a =
framework -=20

yr writers are prob the best judge of their best reviewers - tho of course =
youd know this

is a buzz possible where u r?

it seems not here - tho it is relative - we want visibility at least - ?

perhaps tho a greater issue is the problem - the supporting infrastructure =
etc (lack of) for reviewers? thats def a problem in australia

Cid Corman was a pioneer in this form.  He told me his experiments took
place before an audience--some were taped--but they always resulted in
highly emotional responses.  Artaud also improvised--and Cid was
probably thinking of Artaud when he tried improv.  He told me he saw
Artaud from a distance in Paris, but never up close.  Jess of Japan

[Free Poetry For], formerly, PO25=C2=A2EM is an ongoing series of tiny chap=
books
(4.25=E2=80=B3 by 5.5=E2=80=B3) that are printed in a limited edition of 10=
0 copies.

We started publishing these chapbooks in 2004, and they can be found up and
down the east coast of the USA, primarily, but have been spotted as far awa=
y
as Helsinki, London and Amsterdam. There are currently 85 writers in the
series, with a total pressing of 8500 chapbooks.

Each chapbook features between 8 and 16 pages of poetry by one author.

When the chapbooks are printed, they are disseminated throughout public
space (cafes, airports, buses and bus shelters, trains, waiting rooms, etc.
etc. etc.)

The purpose of the series is to heighten the awareness of poetry by putting
it in odd and unusual places and spaces, where poetry isn=E2=80=99t traditi=
onally
understood to belong.

By reclaiming poetry as a non-permanent, non-referential, non-propriety
action (rather than an object to be relegated to the classrooms and
academia), we give back poetry to the people, regardless of class, race,
gender.

If you would like to be part of this ongoing series, please send 8-16 pages
of poems (and by pages we mean size 4.25=E2=80=B3 by 5.5=E2=80=B3) to
freepoetryfor@gmail.com. Please use this format for the subject line:
Submission/(name)/(title)/freepoetryfor.

The poems have appeared in Milk Magazine, Mipoesias and elsewhere.

Hope you like them.

per Catherine's request that responses to the request for Buddhist
poetry be front-channeled, I'm posting my previously back-channeled
response in case it's helpful/interesting to anyone:

--

Leslie Scalapino's "Autobiography" (in Zither and Autobiography) is
the product of trying to write mindfully, in-the-moment, and
struggling to reconcile/integrate the dualness inherent in the writing
process, especially the writing-autobiography process. She makes some
explicit references to Zen.

John Cage was of course a Zen Buddhist; the best place to go might be
his "Lecture on Nothing."

Gabe Gudding is also a Buddhist, and the later sections of his Rhode
Island Notebook deal with this explicitly.

I assume Gary Snyder & the Beats are on your radar. There's a
collection called Big Sky Mind edited by Carole Tonkinson which deals
specifically with the influence of Buddhism on the Beats.

--

I guess this might be my first posting to this list. I've been lurking
for ages-- so, hello everyone! I'm finishing up a Ph.D. at UC Irvine
with a dissertation on states of attention in 20th-C American poetry--
Buddhism is very much on my radar.

Be well,
Erin

Junction Press lies a lot. For the very few places that still care I produce a few galley copies at the same time as the larger run and misidentify pub date so the biggies think they're getting it 3 or 4 months early. The books usually don't get reviewed anyway, but it's worth a try. And not actionable.

Best,

Mark

This is something I've been doing for years, so maybe it's not new, but I t=
hink I do it very differently to the sound guys.  The performance *is* the =
generation and composition of "text", and is different to performance of mi=
ne where the text is written and then performed.  I did an 8-hour improvisa=
tion about 10 years ago in New York, and will be doing a series of 6 more t=
his June and July in London.  The results will be available.  They're long =
because they include silence, ie not just expenditure till you stop, perhap=
s less male that way!  I once wrote an article about kinds of improvisation=
 for the Poetry Project.   Could forward if you're interested.

Cid Corman was a pioneer in this form.  He told me his experiments took
place before an audience--some were taped--but they always resulted in
highly emotional responses.  Artaud also improvised--and Cid was
probably thinking of Artaud when he tried improv.  He told me he saw
Artaud from a distance in Paris, but never up close.  Jess of Japan

I've had a  huge response (mainly backchannel) to my request for informatio=
n about people involved in improvised poetry. It's very exciting and inform=
ative, I look forward very much to getting to grips with it all. I have tri=
ed to thank most people individually, but many thanks again, especially if =
I have unintentionally left you out!  For those interested in the topic, my=
 previous book on the subject, co-written  with Roger Dean, was Improvisati=
on in the Arts since 1945, Taylor and Francis, 1997. The book I am writing =
the essay for is The Oxford Handbook of Improvisation (two volumes and exte=
nding over many different areas ) . George Lewis and Ben Piekut are editors=
.
Thanks again
Hazel

per Catherine's request that responses to the request for Buddhist =20

  response in case it's helpful/interesting to anyone:
 =20
  --
 =20
  Leslie Scalapino's "Autobiography" (in Zither and Autobiography) is =
=20
  the product of trying to write mindfully, in-the-moment, and =20
  struggling to reconcile/integrate the dualness inherent in the writing=
 =20
  process, especially the writing-autobiography process. She makes some =
=20
  explicit references to Zen.
 =20
  John Cage was of course a Zen Buddhist; the best place to go might be =
=20
  his "Lecture on Nothing."
 =20
  Gabe Gudding is also a Buddhist, and the later sections of his Rhode =
=20
  Island Notebook deal with this explicitly.
 =20
  I assume Gary Snyder & the Beats are on your radar. There's a =20
  collection called Big Sky Mind edited by Carole Tonkinson which deals =
=20
  specifically with the influence of Buddhism on the Beats.

  I guess this might be my first posting to this list. I've been lurking=

  for ages-- so, hello everyone! I'm finishing up a Ph.D. at UC Irvine =

  Buddhism is very much on my radar.

I was visiting a temple in Nara years ago, and an old woman was there
praying to a statue of a famous Buddha of medicine--the statue held a
pot in one hand containing "universal" medicine--and she was saying
the Han Ya Shin gyo--the Lotus sutra--form is emptiness and emptiness is
form, and she was saying it as she told her beads and spreading a kind
of ointment on the book in front of her as she prayed.  She looked very
old and close to death and her prayer was so sincere, and so heart-felt
that it really moved me.  But here's the thing--there were about 20
others in this unheated temple snuffing snot as they do here as it is
impolite to blow one's nose.  And they were all praying to this ancient
statue to be healed.  I felt thousands more in this place: the echo of
hundreds of thousands more gazing at this golden statue down the
generations, daubbing at their noses and praying to feel better with a
sincerity born of living in near poverty in a place where the self is
not valued, where learning went only to the elite.  Those shadows were
all there, all making moan to this same statue in this same dimly lit,
draughty place--but there was a message in this muttering and this
barely audible sound of beads--it was the message of humility and simple
heartedness. These people have lived and live without making their
belief their pedigree--they wouldn't give speeches about it--they
wouldn't wrap it around their shoulders like a superman--or super woman
cape--and blast off on stage in front of a hundred cocktail
sippers--it's simply, it's merely, it's only-- their life.  But sure,
Jane Hirshfield and all the other "enlightened ones" you want to list.

The new ebook from Argotist Ebooks is =E2=80=9CPeriods=E2=80=9D by Joel Cha=
ce.
Description:
=E2=80=9CPeriods=E2=80=9D by Joel Chace was inspired by an insight he had i=
n 2010 that, as he says, =E2=80=98Periods complete sentences, which are com=
plete periods=E2=80=99. Of this he says, =E2=80=98this sentence seemed to e=
xpress two different ideas about periods (and about sentences). Once I real=
ized what this statement suggested, I was intrigued to begin finding and cr=
eating more sentences, more ideas about periods=E2=80=94a collection that h=
as grown into this sequence=E2=80=99.

Subject:      new from chaudiere books: Joe Blades' Casemate Poems (Collected)

Casemate Poems (Collected)
by Joe Blades

published by Chaudiere Books

An earlier, much smaller edition of casemate poems appeared as a
limited-edition book produced by Waterloo, Ontario publisher Widows and
orphans in 2004 as casemate poems, later translated and published in
Belgrade. As Blades himself wrote of that original edition:

	The two suites of casemate poems were written during two one-week
	artist-in-residence stints in 2003 in Fredericton, New Brunswick. These
	were public, interactive, residencies with visitors passing though the
	casemate workspace with two concurrent artists-in-residence scheduled
	for any given week.

	During his residency, Blades had a typewriter set up on a table facing
	the open doorway of the casemate. It was always primed with a sheet of
	paper. In the tradition of writers in storefronts, as Blades finished
	composing each poem, it was attached to the casemate wall. Blades also
	took photographs inside and from within the casemate looking outward:
	images of the casemate itself, of his art in progress, photographs of
	the weaving looms, of the potter and pottery turned.

	In this volume, Blades poems and photographs are combined to produce a
	work that reflects the immediacy of their composition while enabling
	the  reader to experience Blades' writing at their own pace.


From: Pesme iz kazamata (Beograd: Rad, 2005)

	To read Canadian poet and artist Joe Blades book of poetry casemate
	poems means to get knowledge about one very specific way of
	understanding poetry today. [] Blades poetry is written by activating
	different layers of human knowledge and by articulation of this knowledge,
	for example, in narrations of history and geography. He moves in time
	(historical perspective) and in space (for example, actual events in the
	world at the time, such as the attack on the World Trade Center, or
	pointing to the contemporary racist attitudes of specific
	countercultures.

Jared, do yourself a favor and spend some time in Asia.  Live in a
country where everyone you meet is or was a Buddhist, from the bus
driver to the street people to the trembling old man sitting across from
you on the train who still wishes to kill you because of WWII., and who
is nevertheless a buddhist.  It takes some of the wow factor away.
Every poem they would write would be a buddhist poem, I guess, and every
breath they take is a buddhist breath, and they see life the way a
buddhist sees life.

Are these people enlightened?  I sit down to dinner with them, and
they're average people trying to live their lives and pay their bills.

Most "buddhist poems" I've read from American buddhists have a tiny
drum beating inside of them saying 1) look at me, look at me, look at me
and 2) I'm a buddhist writing buddhist poems therefore 1) look at me,
look at me, look at me.  I'm "different" I'm "better" I'm "not
one of them"--which is all essentially--and paradoxically--not asian.

What wisdom they spout is borrowed from the hard-won insights of the real
geniuses of Asian culture.

They go on giving foot-notes or using terminology they picked up
somewhere to convince the innocent reader that somehow they know
something that everybody else doesn't.  That somehow their lives are
perhaps more intense, more beautiful, more "correct" more forgiving,
more (name your spiritual flavor of the day)--and it's all because of
that special look-at-me thing, and not because of any talent, or lack
of, that they might have in their native language--which is what poetry
is really all about.

It's a way of getting ahead of the game in America.  Of asserting
yourself, grabbing what's rightfully yours, and playing others for
whatever it is po-biz can give you.  It's a way you can build a career.
 Jared, if you'd come over here, you'd see just how Amerikan most
"buddhist poetry" is.

There's a kind of comparable excitement among the Japanese when someone
declares him or her self a christian.  There's a sense of mystery and
romance and all of that stuff, dating back to the days of the Nagasaki
martyrs and the Shimabara riots and the Dutch on dejima, etc. etc.  My
students do it sometimes and it's a "look at me" moment, which would
soon fade away if they visited a town full of Sarah Palin supporters in
Iowa.

Unenlightened, Jess of Japan. (Now 20 years here.)
