Two reviews in for !Cyclones in High Northern Latitudes":

Depicting a waking, lucid dreamscape, the shifting interior cinema of lost love sets itself against the gathered debris of a recalled former life. Echoes of Hamsun's HUNGER congeal with Patchen's JOURNAL OF ALBION MOONLIGHT in a rich interior monologue, traipsing through the surreal landscape of memory ...
"I learned long ago
to distinguish between
strong memories and
whatever the world is ..."
Blurring the subjective/reality boundary, this is a phenomenological in-look freighted with the memories of a non-named woman, a love gone sour after a time of many kisses. Now the narrator, an outlaw on the run, hiding in cloisters, in a strange town with assumed name and face, remains sustained by these images of HER, even as the warnings indicate he is still being followed. His days reside in the "dilemma/of the broken hearted"; he begins to lose temporal perspective, a living exile from his past. He falls back to studying the indecipherable clouds ...
The collaborative narration weaves us through a shifting time-flux, a moving floor between memory-past and perception-present ... here, the outlaw is looking through a dirty Bowery window, perhaps after a day spent as an insurance clerk poring over columns of actuary tables in some vague city location ... there, we see him drinking the nepenthe of the village locals, full of his thoughts of yet a previous exiled life ... then a shifting retreat back to the actuary tables, which may hold the "traces ... of cyclones/in high northern latitudes ...
By the residue of high hope, the narrator prays that "one day you will/experience my love" - by which the shadow of longing transcends the mundanity of being a data entry clerk ...
The bold ink drawings by Rich Curtis round out this joint effort by two exemplary poets. Highly recommended reading ...

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Matt Hill

This is a modern book. A current collaboration. Jake Berry and Jeffrey Side have come together, along with the artist Rich Curtis to lead us through a journey of the stratosphere that include algorithms, the dogs of cognizance, actuary tables and a glimpse of 50 worlds passing.
 The poets write, "I have difficulty believing that I, in another time and form, created them myself." Then a few pages later write, "...and I can see the clouds forming now and a storm brewing."
 These storms are cyclones like the title suggests. Whirling from the marshes and up into the adrenaline of the clouds. The reader gets caught up in the earth, immigrants in an orchard shrouded by dunes.
 Cyclones In High Northern Latitudes delivers on the titles suggestion of flight. As John Steinbeck wrote, "The very air here is miraculous."

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Chris Mansel

A recent review of Sonnets by rob mclennan:
There are so few that seem to know how to bring something new to an often-u=
sed form that when it happens, it=92s worth noting, and such is the case wi=
th Toronto poet Camille Martin in her second trade poetry collection, Sonne=
ts (Exeter England: Shearsman Books, 2010). Martin, an American relocated n=
orth after Hurricane Katrina, writes with the most wonderful sense of clari=
ty, thought and play in these poems . . .

Dear poetics list - have any of you publishers ever produced an audio book?
Know anyone who has? I'm looking for lots of general information about
recording, etc.

Many thanks!

Dear All,
Apologies for cross-posting. Here's notice of another notable
Cambridge event, this time courtesy of John Kerrigan.
Best,
Sam



CAMBRIDGE GROUP FOR IRISH STUDIES

TREVOR JOYCE: POETRY READING AND DISCUSSION

Tuesday, 4 May, 8.45 p.m.
The Parlour, Magdalene College

All welcome
Wine and whiskey served

Trevor Joyce will read from his own poetry, and that of his
contemporaries, then answer questions about his work and the poetry
scene in Ireland.

Joyce is one of Ireland's leading poets. Associated with modernist
traditions that go back to Beckett and the other Joyce, and with poetry
in the Irish language (from which he has translated extensively) back to
/Buile Suibhne/, he has produced a body of work which is challengingly
distinct from the mainstream but which has significant points of contact
with poetry across Europe and with experimentalists in Ireland who are
now attracting international attention. He has lived and worked in Cork
for twenty-five years, for the last twelve of which he has been a
director of SoundEye. His books include /with the first dream of fire
they hunt the cold/ (New Writers' Press/Shearsman, 2001 & 2003) and
/What's in Store/ (NWP/The Gig, 2008). /Courts of Air and Earth/
(Shearsman, 2009) gathers all his workings from middle and early-modern
Irish. He has been a Fulbright Scholar, is a member of Aosd=E1na, and is
the Judith E. Wilson Visiting Poetry Fellow in Cambridge for 2009-10.

The session will be chaired by Sinead Garrigan-Mattar, an authority on
Irish literature and a Fellow of Girton College.

Any questions to jk10023

Dear Lisa,
I'm also very interested.
Since most of my work is performance poetry, I would love to find a
publishing house which would want to publish my poetry both on CD or DVD and
in a printed form.

There are of course several online audio databases and magazines, textsound,
toxic poetry, lyrikline, ubuweb,...

So looking forward to reading more on that topic too.

Philip

"The Theory of the Avant-Garde and Practice" by Libbie Rifkin at The Argoti=
st Online:
http://www.argotistonline.co.uk/Rifkin%20essay.htm
Excerpt:
"Enzensberger traces the military roots of the term "avant-garde," breaking=
 it down into its component parts and pushing each to its aporetic limit. T=
he first aporia emerges when the avant-garde moves from the synchrony of th=
e battle field to the diachrony of historical progress. Confronting the ene=
my up ahead, the "en avant of the avant-garde would, as it were, realize th=
e future in the present, anticipate the course of history". In spite of tre=
mendous advances in prognostication by the "consciousness industry," this i=
s, of course, impossible. And yet the whole system depends on this impossib=
ility; the avant-garde is the engine of advancement for the main body of ar=
tistic works, but the scene of its reception is, by definition, always just=
 out of reach.  The avant-garde=E2=80=99s value, in fact its very identity,=
 can only be determined by the future generations for whom it is already pa=
ss=C3=A9."

Jack Kimball is a self-described after-language poet based in Boston but
often identified with New York. A number of his books are published by Potes
and Poets Press (Witness Protection, 1997; Quite Vacation, 1998; Frosted,
2001). Terrence Diggory suggests "identification of that press with Language
poetry has established a context for the reception of Kimball's work. For
instance, in a blurb for Frosted, Tony Towle noted 'mysterious ironies and
enjambments, lines that are stunningly odd, and various kinds of oblique
narrative that may owe something to "language" influences, but are often
also resonant of Jimmy Schuyler.'" Resonating with another New York poet,
Kimball set one complex goal, later modified, in recent work, Post~Twyla
(published 2006, republished 2010): to keep a sardonic diary, compressing
reactions to every page of John Ashbery's masterpiece Flow Chart by way of
fake haiku and renga-like short verse and prose commentary. Publisher of
Faux Press, Kimball blogs at pantaloons.blogspot.com. He does not twitter.

Stacy Szymaszek was born and raised in Milwaukee, WI. From 1999 to 2005, she
was the Literary Program Manager for the nonprofit literary organization
Woodland Pattern Book Center. In 2005 she moved to New York to serve as
Program Coordinator at the Poetry Project at St. Mark's Church. In 2006-07,
she served as Monday Night Reading Coordinator. She became Artistic Director
in 2007. She is the author of the chapbooks Mutual Aid (gong press, 2004),
Some Mariners (Etherdome, 2004), There Were Hostilities (repair, 2005),
Pasolini Poems (Cy Press, 2005), from Hyperglossia (Belladonna Books, 2005),
Stacy S: Autoportraits (OMG! Press, 2008), Orizaba: A Voyage with Hart Crane
(Faux Chaps, 2008), from Hyperglossia(Hot Whiskey Press, 2008) and from Hart
Island (Albion Books, 2009). Her first full-length book, Emptied of All
Ships, was published in 2005 and her second book Hyperglossia in 2009, both
with Litmus Press. http://www.litmuspress.org/szymaszek.html (photo by John
Sarsgard).

CAConrad is the recipient of The Gil Ott Book Award for The Book of Frank
(Chax Press, 2009). He is also the author of Advanced Elvis Course (Soft
Skull Press, 2009), (Soma)tic Midge(Faux Press, 2008), Deviant Propulsion
(Soft Skull Press, 2006), and a collaboration with poet Frank Sherlock
titled The City Real & Imagined(Factory School, 2010). The son of white
trash asphyxiation, his childhood included selling cut flowers along the
highway for his mother and helping her shoplift. Visit him online at

Some recording from Jazz Lounge gig tonight -

Well for one thing the other group didn't show and for another, the
recording - which I did - turned out largely unusable except for the
following excerpts which give a fairly good idea of what went on, with the
exception of Azure's songs - these didn't come out at all. What I think
happened was that subsonic stage and other floor movements resonated with
the corner we played in - a kind of wolf-note effect below the range of
human hearing, but not below the range of recorder compression. The result
was literally impossible to listen to - lots of thumps and things unheard
but sensed, taking out the music. After using graphic equalization, hard
limiting, normalization, hiss reduction and editing, the following is what
resulted - on it you'll hear Myk Freedman, guitar, and myself, oud and
cura cumbus in some fairly weird combinations. Everything else had to be
scrapped. But this stuff's good -

INTERRUPTURE DOCUMENT #6: Performance Videos from 4/20 performance.


INTERRUPTURE is a group of experimental poets that performs text compositions structured as a game.

Each piece follows a set of rules that determines who, what, where, when, and how a poet will read their verse as the play of the game unfolds.

These rules might encourage silence, polyphony, erasure, repetition, modulation, and so on, making each game a unique event.

Team Interrupture lineup for Document #6:  Daniel Comiskey, Kreg Hasegawa, Bryant Mason, Annalisa Pesek, and C.E. Putnam.

Performance Date / Location:  Canoe Social Club, Seattle, Wa - April 20, 2010

How Modern are we speaking? Do you want to focus on contemporary writers or
are you also looking to include "less-token" modernists/Beats/langpo/san
fran rennaissance poets etc?

I've found that the Elective Affinities blog is a very useful resource for
more contemporary/younger writers.

http://electiveaffinitiesusa.blogspot.com/

It's a cooperative anthology of US Poetry run by a friend of mine, Carlos
Soto Roman.

By "American," do you mean U.S.?

gb

Or do you include, say, Cuban, Chileno, Mexican poetry?

how is your institution framing "modern"?  what are pre-req, what is
post-req?  or, this being an area of interest, what course is it
replacing -- either on the schedule or for your students?

Subject:      A Community Writing Itself is out from Dalkey
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=utf-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable

My collection of interviews is out from Dalkey Archive. It's called A Commu=
nity Writing Itself: Conversations with Vanguard Writers or the Bay Area an=
d features interviews with Kathleen Fraser, Michael Palmer, Nathaniel Macke=
y, Brenda Hillman, Camille Roy, Juliana Spahr, Truong Tran, Barbara Guest, =
Stephen Ratcliffe, Robert Gluck, Elizabeth Robinson, and Leslie Scalapino, =
as well as an introduction that places the writing within a historical cont=
ext of experimentation in Bay Area writing. =0A=0AAvailable at: =0Ahttp://w=
ww.dalkeyarchive.com/book/?GCOI=3D15647100098560 =0A(and Amazon)=0A=0ABlurb=
s:=0ASarah Rosenthal's interviews with some of the most engaging and import=
ant American poets of the time, all working in the Bay Area, provide vivid =
commentary on the state of the art and some of the most useful commentary a=
vailable on the work of each individual writer. =E2=80=93 Charles Bernstein=
=0A=C2=A0 =0AAn extraordinary compendium of close engagement with the writi=
ng, ethos, and practice of a number of poets who are in situ in the Bay Are=
a, one of the most historically fertile grounds for experimental poetry for=
 a great number of decades. It=E2=80=99s where the Beat literary movement b=
urst upon the Culture at large, and the New American Poetry and its legacie=
s became a cohesive literary =E2=80=9Coutrider=E2=80=9D force. The current =
poetics community is just as radically potent and individually active, forg=
ing new syntaxes and a =E2=80=9Cnew company of voices,=E2=80=9D as Michael =
Palmer puts it. Considerations of history, politics, psychology, spirituali=
ty, identity, gender, media, chance operation, performance, and community k=
eep the discourse lively and relevant. This is an invaluable resource of =
=E2=80=9Cdeep talk=E2=80=9D for writers, scholars, and fans alike. Hats off=
 to Sarah Rosenthal who has kept track and asked the provocative questions.=
 =E2=80=93 Anne Waldman =0A=C2=A0 =0ASarah Rosenthal's teleological study o=
f Bay Area poetics, in the form of a liquid, prickly conversation, manages =
to delight its reader at the same time that it generates a new set of obses=
sions. A poetry "expressed in color." The moment when "what seemed impossib=
ly strange becomes less so =E2=80=93 sometimes anyway." How an alphabet mig=
ht "unbraid" itself, which isn't "metatext." It's sudden and overwhelming k=
nowledge about what "the end of the poem" might bring. See: Agamben via Hoo=
doo via a "secret autobiography." In its exploration of intersections of ex=
perimental writing community, feminine monstrosity and "horny" form =E2=80=
=93 at least, that's where my reading ran a series of red lights =E2=80=93 =
Rosenthal's book is a delicious graft of thinking and writing, performed ju=
st outside the safety zone of transcription. You can't go wrong with the mo=
st intense form of banter: "turning about with," from the Latin root conver=
sationem, "others." =E2=80=93 Bhanu Kapil =0A=C2=A0 =0AWhat Steve Abbott an=
d Bruce Boone achieved with the Left/Write Unity Conference in early eighti=
es San Francisco, bringing together differing groups of poets, Sarah Rosent=
hal thankfully reenacts in her collection of interviews with Bay Area write=
rs. In A Community Writing Itself twelve poets serving various poetics, fro=
m Language writing to New Narrative, are allowed to break consensus regardi=
ng the notion of a singular development of shared ambitions. As approaches =
to the politics of writing are individually charted, connections and commun=
ities unfold. If one is interested in the evolution of American poetry sinc=
e 1950, it is necessary to engage these conversations. =E2=80=93 Claudia Ra=

You are invited to participate in the first World Listening Day, which
happens on Sunday, July 18, 2010. The purposes of World Listening Day =
are:=20

=B7         to celebrate the practice of listening as it relates to the =
world
around us, environmental awareness, and acoustic ecology

=B7         to raise awareness about issues related to the World =
Soundscape
Project, World Listening Project, World Forum for Acoustic Ecology, and
individual and group efforts to creatively explore phonography

=B7         to design and implement educational initiatives which =
explore
these concepts and practices

=20

July 18 was chosen as the date for World Listening Day because it is the
birthday of the Canadian composer R. Murray Schafer. Schafer is one of =
the
founders of the Acoustic Ecology movement. The World Soundscape Project,
which he directed, is an important organization which has inspired a lot =
of
activity in this field, and his book Soundscape: The Tuning of the World
helped to define many of the terms and background behind the acoustic
ecology movement.=20

Ekphrastic Nexus: Visual Art and Creative Writing



Friday, June 25 (6 p.m.) at Chicago Urban Art Society



You are invited to attend "Ekphrastic Nexus: Visual Art and Creative
Writing," which includes a panel discussion, followed by performances. This
event is part of the "Studio Chicago" calendar of events. There is a
suggested donation, and refreshments will be provided.



The panel involves writers and visual artists about text-image
collaborations, as well as writers who have gotten inspiration from visual
art, and it explores ways writers make connections with art and the visual
artistic process, furthering the continuum of the artist's studio as school,
gallery, political stance, sanctuary, and muse.



Contemporary writers and artists need a clean, well lit room of their own to
create. Whether physical as a cabin in the woods or ubiquitous as online
presence, the studio matters to Chicago culture makers because of the many
out-of-time or out-of-ethics rituals it suggests. Making art doesn't have to
be political: this freedom is what makes art radically political.



We will discuss details about the spaces in which we work, whether those
spaces are separate industrial studio space, home offices, or other kinds of
spaces. Also, the nature of the work that happen in those studio spaces
relates to how the spaces themselves are set up, whether the work involves
what is done in solitude, or with collaborations (in physical and virtual
spaces). We will consider how Chicago institutions and colloquia
opportunities might support Chicago artists and writers.



Participants include Annie Heckman (Owner + Director, StepSister Press),
Eric Elshtain (Editor of Beard of Bees), Krista Franklin (writer, artist,
and educator, Kathryn Born (editor of Chicago Art Magazine), Valerie Wallace
(writer and educator), and Gene Tanta (writer, visual artist, and educator),
moderated by Dan Godston (writer, musician, and educator).

for immigrant communities. For this event=2C she will attempt to speak on=20
the role of trance and hallucination in the healing of war-time=20

 The Island=2C published by Second Story Books=2C  Laynie Brown wrote=2C "A=

poetic healer=2C Murray is adept at the Doolittle-esque notion of=20
conversing with animals and elements." When Beth got her masters in=20
performance art in the early 90's=2C her pieces examined the intersections
 of animal and human consciousness. As a homeopath=2C she has continued=20
this focus. In her practice with humans=2C she utilizes a fascinating new=20
method pioneered by Rajan Sankaran that taps the capacity of language=20
and gesture to reveal the "non-human song" of each person's state. Her=20
life work is to develop a method to hear the specific "song" of=20

I'm happy to say that a thoughtful, appreciative review of Infinite
Difference: Other Poetries by UK Women Poets appears in Stride Magazine,
written by Steve Spence:
http://www.stridemagazine.co.uk/Stride%20mag2010/april%202010/Women.spence.htm
 .

Perhaps this will persuade those of you who haven't yet bought the anthology
to do so? It's available at SPD here:
http://www.spdbooks.org/Producte/9781848610996/infinite-difference-other-poetries-by-uk-women-poets.aspx
 .

By the way, regarding the note at the end of the review about Helen
Macdonald, she was repeatedly solicited, but never sent any work.

My collection of interviews is out from Dalkey Archive. It's called A Commu=
nity Writing Itself: Conversations with Vanguard Writers or the Bay Area an=
d features interviews with Kathleen Fraser, Michael Palmer, Nathaniel Macke=
y, Brenda Hillman, Camille Roy, Juliana Spahr, Truong Tran, Barbara Guest, =
Stephen Ratcliffe, Robert Gluck, Elizabeth Robinson, and Leslie Scalapino, =
as well as an introduction that places the writing within a historical cont=
ext of experimentation in Bay Area writing.=20

Available at dalkeyarchive.com and amazon.com

Blurbs:
Sarah Rosenthal's interviews with some of the most engaging and important A=
merican poets of the time, all working in the Bay Area, provide vivid comme=
ntary on the state of the art and some of the most useful commentary availa=
ble on the work of each individual writer. =E2=80=93 Charles Bernstein
 =20
An extraordinary compendium of close engagement with the writing, ethos, an=
d practice of a number of poets who are in situ in the Bay Area, one of the=
 most historically fertile grounds for experimental poetry for a great numb=
er of decades. It=E2=80=99s where the Beat literary movement burst upon the=
 Culture at large, and the New American Poetry and its legacies became a co=
hesive literary =E2=80=9Coutrider=E2=80=9D force. The current poetics commu=
nity is just as radically potent and individually active, forging new synta=
xes and a =E2=80=9Cnew company of voices,=E2=80=9D as Michael Palmer puts i=
t. Considerations of history, politics, psychology, spirituality, identity,=
 gender, media, chance operation, performance, and community keep the disco=
urse lively and relevant. This is an invaluable resource of =E2=80=9Cdeep t=
alk=E2=80=9D for writers, scholars, and fans alike. Hats off to Sarah Rosen=
thal who has kept track and asked the provocative questions. =E2=80=93 Anne=
 Waldman=20
 =20
Sarah Rosenthal's teleological study of Bay Area poetics, in the form of a =
liquid, prickly conversation, manages to delight its reader at the same tim=
e that it generates a new set of obsessions. A poetry "expressed in color."=
 The moment when "what seemed impossibly strange becomes less so =E2=80=93 =
sometimes anyway." How an alphabet might "unbraid" itself, which isn't "met=
atext." It's sudden and overwhelming knowledge about what "the end of the p=
oem" might bring. See: Agamben via Hoodoo via a "secret autobiography." In =
its exploration of intersections of experimental writing community, feminin=
e monstrosity and "horny" form =E2=80=93 at least, that's where my reading =
ran a series of red lights =E2=80=93 Rosenthal's book is a delicious graft =
of thinking and writing, performed just outside the safety zone of transcri=
ption. You can't go wrong with the most intense form of banter: "turning ab=
out with," from the Latin root conversationem, "others." =E2=80=93 Bhanu Ka=
pil=20
 =20
What Steve Abbott and Bruce Boone achieved with the Left/Write Unity Confer=
ence in early eighties San Francisco, bringing together differing groups of=
 poets, Sarah Rosenthal thankfully reenacts in her collection of interviews=
 with Bay Area writers. In A Community Writing Itself twelve poets serving =
various poetics, from Language writing to New Narrative, are allowed to bre=
ak consensus regarding the notion of a singular development of shared ambit=
ions. As approaches to the politics of writing are individually charted, co=
nnections and communities unfold. If one is interested in the evolution of =
American poetry since 1950, it is necessary to engage these conversations. =

Jim, I sent a back list query more on interaction. If you wish to
discuss openly, okay be me. You have identified something I can't yet be
confident about.... best wishes, Chris Jones.

Hi all,

I'm looking for an intern who could assist with two big festivals Boog
is a part of in the coming months, a Boston-area poetry marathon from
Fri. July 30-Sun. Aug. 1, organized by Jim Behrle, John Mulrooney, and
myself, and the fourth annual Welcome to Boog City poetry and music
festival, from Fri. Sept. 24-Tues. Sept. 28.

If any of you profs might have a student who they think would be game
to help with some key organizational duties, please lemme know.

thanks!
david

Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII; format=flowed

* I know the outline's vague - working this into a paper of sorts -
please comment if it makes any sense at all to you - thanks, Alan -



(thinking about SL, not in terms of RL or extrapolation -if such be
possible - a crude, close to useless, outline below)


deliberately mistaken ontologies of life-worlds


"The SL space is almost always treated as a simulacrum of real life - by
the creators as well! But as an abstracted mathematical topology, it's far
more than that; others will take it farther in the future, already are. I
also want to discuss being-in-mathesis, beyond the SL 'standard' represen-
tation."

SL: [describe] = 2 [split choice]
0:
RL: [explain] = 1 [given]

---------------------------------------

0: neutral
1: obdurate, there is, idiotic real
2: choice / intentionality

0: neitherness, not both A and B, neither A nor B (a priori mathesis)
1: fragility of the good: computer program error, intrinsic
2: error extrinsic, deferment

0: null set
1: universal set
2: split tending towards as-if

1-2: leakages between them
problematic metaphor [0/1/2]: numbers as markers of inscriptions,
  multiplicities, neutralities (the idiotic)

RL: 1: immersive, fundamentally dynamic (potential stases)
  - internal: operated _in_
SL: 2: definable, fundamentally static (real mobility)
  - external operators: operated _on_

Attacking the metaphor: misplaced quantification and ordering among
'plexa,' misplaced mathesis (plexus, from plico, plicatum, to fold,
to knit - Lynd's Class-Book of Etymology, 1861)

Intentionality:
suturing in RL: cohering subjectivity, harmonic continuity, incoherent
  and dynamic inscribing
suturing in SL: coherent physics, discordant continuity, coherent
  inscribing (it's inscription that holds it together)

Problematic ontology of SL: mathesis/inscription = what is; the world
  is a world only by virtue of its (visible, sensed) manifestation,
  information clarified and lost, backup of SL
Problematic ontology of RL: virtual particles, information entanglement
  and conservation, no backup

Off the map i -

Nagarjuna and Madhyamaka - emptiness and dependent origination /
dependent arising

Off the map ii -

SL: Think of root originations in server farms, permissions and
  specificies of address
RL: Think of fundamental ontologies under erasure, feynman diagram
  probabilities: what constitutes dependency under probability
  distributions -

Off the map iii -

Physical ontology is always abstracted, as-if
  (SL and anti-conventionalist argument)
There is no _fundamental_ physical ontology

Off the map iv -

Mathesis and Badiou's position - relation to surreal numbers

On the map -

Thinking of SL as abstracted, split, chosen, programmed: anything that is
programmable is possible. Thinking of RL as given, born-into: thought as
conceiving. Consider SL _not_ as subset of RL - as fulcrum; consider SL
as the visual counterpart of the space of Mathematica.

Psychology, psychoanalytics of SL in this case: matrix, borromean knot,
  meta-level jumping (collocation of constructing, dwelling-in)
The body as entangled projections/introjections (jectivity) independent
  of traditional physical constraint or representation
The locus of the body in the physical body (SL as perceptual organ)

The traditional/narratological function of SL = equivalent to cinematic
  diegesis
The non-traditional functioning of SL (above) = processes of dynamic
  suturing

"Imagining a Bauhaus Poetics" workshop

at tonight's Next Objectivists meeting

7 p.m. at the Mess Hall in Chicago

We meet to consider the possibility of a Bauhaus Poetics. The Bauhaus, which
existed in Germany between the wars, is primarily noted for its influence on
modern art, architecture, and design. The participation by Anni and Josef
Albers, both associated with the school, in Black Mountain College during
Olson's term suggests the possibility of a direct influence on U.S. poets of
that school. Less direct influences will also be considered when we gather
to ask, "What would a poetry of the Bauhaus be like"?

WHAT TO US (press) is looking for a new species relationship, ie MUTUALISM.

Like a cow and celluose-digesting microbes. (Just like that, actually.)

MEANING: WHAT TO US is seeking a new book to make.

In this instance, here are the pieces that would make it a whole:

WHAT TO US is looking for work...

by a WOMAN;
by a writer without a significant number of chapbook publications or
without a larger book publication;
and looking for a smaller work, 10 pages or less.

The work can be POETRY, FICTION, or any happy IN BETWEEN you think is
worth me working hours to make into a tiny book.

Work can be sent in hard copy to Hailey Higdon @ 2205 E Boston Street,
Philadelphia, PA 19125. Also, I like little cards. Can you send me a
little card telling me something about you? It can be anything you
want really, just something.

Deadline for submissions is June 1, 2010. Tell your friends, tell your
family, tell the celluose-digesting microbes that the cow is eating
grass now!

                                                    This book is about=
 Susan Howe's poetry from the perspective of space. Howe reshapes cultural=
 configurations of space through her drive to infiltrate interstitial areas=
 of "third" spaces: the silences of history, the margins of the page, the=
 placeless migrants, and the uncharted lands. Nuances, frontiers,=
 thresholds, edges, fuzzinesses, ambiguities, pauses, singularities,=
 margins: these are the spaces where her poetry occurs, places that lie=
 between two states. Rather than absences, therefore, the space of this=
 poetry is a place of being, of what Gilles Deleuze and F=E9lix Guattari=
 refer to as becoming. Third space is contested because it must also call=
 itself into question in reimagining itself; in questioning its condition=
 and rethinking itself, it contradicts itself repeatedly, setting up the=
 form of an ever-present yet ever-shifting paradox of self-presencing. This=
 site is also, however, the place of no frames or boundaries, a place that=
 is all margins and singularities, that site of displacement, where=
 migration is eternal and violence is perennial. Nomadism becomes an emblem=
 in Howe's poetry for the twentieth-century condition as it represents the=
 continual movement through space of the body, that never-ending,=
 always-perpetuated sense of loss of place, but that equally charged coming=
 into being regardless of the space within which that loss/becoming occurs.

Jim, I wonder if yould care to compare quiddities? How does Lopes'
understanding of programmability compare with that of Lev Manevich's
ideas about database narrative? The one seems to repeat out ideas of
language being a game of radical designation (Lopes) while the other
seems based in the idea that language is inherently gnomic (Manevich).
(Kripke vs. Frege 2.0?)

Hi There

We hope this finds you well.


We'd like to invite you to the premier event of
P||R||O||J||E||C||T||I||O||N||S, our new live film narration series at the
Bowery Poetry Club (308 Bowery and Bleecker st). This performance series
presents an active intersection of moving text and moving image:



* 1. text moving sonically through space*

* 2. image moving on the surface of a screen*



The fundamental scenario presents one or more present persons utilizing
words &/or sounds &/or movement to mediate both spatially and conceptually
between images on a screen and a live audience. (We have in mind, of course,
the Japanese, Korean, Polish, and former USSR
traditions<http://autotypist.blogspot.com/2008/03/movietelling-for-more-practical-avant.html>
as
models in spirit.)



If you have a Facebook account, please do join our page for updated
information, as well as a full description of the series:
http://www.facebook.com/group...php?v=info&gid=110234529005546<http://www.msplinks.com/MDFodHRwOi8vd3d3LmZhY2Vib29rLmNvbS9ncm91cC5waHA/dj1pbmZvJmdpZD0xMTAyMzQ1MjkwMDU1NDY=>.
The premier will feature:
*
Stephanie Gray
Lisa Jarnot
Alejandro Crawford *

*on Sunday, May 16*

*Bowery Poetry Club <http://www.bowerypoetry.com/#Home>*

*6 pm*

*
*$6 at the door.
Full bar available.

You'll find the bios of the performers below. Hope to see you on Sunday!

- Paolo Javier & Jeremy James Thompson

*Stephanie Gray* will perform 15 minutes from a current super 8 film/poetry
project: *You know they want to disappear Hell's Kitchen as Clinton.*  In
mysterious silent insistent shots, she films an inspired letter of sorts to
writer E.B. White, author of the mid-century little book *Here is New York*.
Stephanie is a poet and experimental filmmaker. Her first collection of
poems, *Heart Stoner Bingo*, was published by Straw Gate Books in 2007. In
support of her films, she has received a New York Foundation for the Arts
Fellowship and a New York State Council on the Arts grant. Her films have
screened internationally, including at the Ann Arbor, Oberhausen, Viennale,
Chicago Underground, and Madcat film festivals.

*Lisa Jarnot* starred in the film *The Time We
Killed*<http://www.cinema-scope.com/cs20/ar_kite_reeves.htm>by
Jennifer Todd Reeves. She is the author of
*Night Scenes* (2008), *Iliad XXII: The Death of Hector* (2006), *Black Dog
Songs *(2003), *Ring of Fire* (2001), and *Some Other Kind of
Mission*(1996), among other books. She is a past editor of the Poetry
Project
Newsletter, edited *An Anthology of New (American) Poetry* (2007), and lives
and works in New York as a freelance horticulturalist.

*Alejandro Miguel Justino Crawford* is co-inventor of The Benshi
Organ<http://sites.google.com/site/benshiorgan/>,
a two-octave midi keyboard that allows the player to compose genre-specific
movie dialogue by simply "playing" the instrument. He is an artist,
performer, and writer currently studying at NYU's Interactive
Telecommunications Program (ITP). He is a former Fulbright Scholar to
Portugal, the author of Morpheus (BlazeVOX 2009), and his work can be found

Subject:      The Edge of the Underworld
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"
Content-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable

BlazeVOX [books] has just published THE EDGE OF THE UNDERWORLD, my fourth b=
ook of poetry, based on a homophonic translation of Virgil (for more, see b=
elow).



For review-copy PDFs, write:

Michael.ruby@wsj.com<mailto:Michael.ruby@wsj.com>



Here are a book description of THE EDGE OF THE UNDERWORLD, blurbs, order in=
formation and my bio:



After studying Louis Zukofsky's Rudens in graduate school, I always wanted =
to write a homophonic translation.  A decade later, I settled on the long o=
pening of Book VI of Virgil's Aeneid, the famous Underworld book, and wrote=
 "Sic Fatur Lacrimans."  Soon afterward, sensing the translation itself nee=
ded translation, I decided to derive other poems from the words and phrases=
 of "Sic Fatur Lacrimans"-poems that would be connected to the long poem an=
d to each other, in a sort of literary Rayonism.  I saw the book as the ver=
bal equivalent of St. Sebastian pierced by arrows, with "Sic Fatur Lacriman=
s" as St. Sebastian and the shorter poems as the arrows, crisscrossing each=
 other.



-Michael Ruby



"Call it immersion": take Michael Ruby's sibilant heterographic tour of the=
 underworld's underwords and rediscover in these homophonic burrows that so=
nic intersection is ear + imagination.  At once "tenebrous children" and a =
"jangling ring of skeleton keys," these poems ghost-grasp their father (or =
was it patrimony's patter?), then intrafiliate to interlock in lines that h=
aunt: we watch these "seals kiss" as "bus urn," to "out vain era...// air a=
 care...//none inferior" and "still soak to a purpose somewhere."  Ruby, ta=
ke a golden bow-this work's "[to elicit] a response from littoral folk" and=
 figural ones, too.



-Judith Goldman



 "Ghostly cooing fills the moist dark places," and the reader and dreamer r=
eturns to the Underworld, together, already there, "Circling in an eddy for=
 the time being."



-Christophe Casamassima



THE EDGE OF THE UNDERWORLD is available through BlazeVOX's website:

http://www.blazevox.org/bk-mruby2.htm



Michael Ruby is the author of AT AN INTERSECTION (Alef Books, 2002), WINDOW=
 ON THE CITY (BlazeVOX [books], 2006), FLEETING MEMORIES (ebook at www.ugly=
ducklingpresse.org/WEBBOOK-RUBY/index.html<http://www.uglyducklingpresse.or=
g/WEBBOOK-RUBY/index.html>, 2008) and the forthcoming COMPULSIVE WORDS (Bla=
zeVOX, 2010). A graduate of Harvard College and Brown University's writing =
program, he lives in Brooklyn and works as an editor at The Wall Street Jou=
rnal.

Recently Published Poems:

=C2=A0ON SHAVU=E2=80=99OT

My grandchild asks what Jewish people believe in.
Her parents giving me that wide-eye look that=0A signals
=E2=80=9CHELP,=E2=80=9D I jump in and bumble my way through
Sunday School platitudes: love, kindness, respect, etc.
Each one elicits a jaded silence from the kid.

I suspect I=E2=80=99m losing ground but can only think of
Pain, prejudice, persecution =E2=80=94
Not what I want to tell a five-year-old who still finds
Scary moments in Winnie-The-Pooh.
=E2=80=9CC=E2=80=99mon,=E2=80=9D she says. =E2=80=9CLike in the scroll, the=
 Torah.=E2=80=9D

Now that I=E2=80=99ve led her to the place where my roots
Lie tangled within a borrowed name,
Can I confess I don=E2=80=99t remember,
Maybe never even knew? Undone,
I tell my son to look for an answer on the Web.

{The Mom Egg =E2=80=9CLessons=E2=80=9D Anthology (Vol. 8, 2010) and read at=
 the Cornelia Street Cafe book launch April 25, 2010}


MY NEW FRIEND

Both of us American, born in 1938,
our stories are filled with similarities =E2=80=93
marriage, children, divorce,
erasures too painful to discuss =E2=80=93

but we=0A sense a stronger link.
Her photo album sets the landscape
to compare notes on foreign countries,
other places we have been.

In the midst of Germany
she flips a batch of pictures all at once,
says they came from someone else.
Out of curiosity, I turn the pages back.

DACHAU . . . blinding in black and white.
As I shut my eyes to blot the image out,
she gently takes the book and closes it,
for neither one of us was there.

{Poetica Publishing Co. "L'Mizmor L=E2=80=99David" Anthology, Volume I: "Th=
e Shoah", 2010} =C2=A0


THE DRY CLEANER'S WIFE

A snappy dresser, I thought
the first time I saw her,
straight and stiff as a soldier
behind the counter.
German, maybe Austrian,
descended from aristocracy,
she took with aplomb
the soiled clothes
I handed over for cleaning.

Her husband, making it clear
that he was not to be disturbed,
sat at a separate table
stooped=0A over an account book
like a scholar reading the Talmud
in a room without enough light,
his identity still revealed
by the tattooed=C2=A0 numbers
visible below his rolled-up shirt sleeve.

As the stolid wife
gathered up my bundle
and carried it to the back of the store,
my attention was drawn
to the way she hobbled.
Sheathed in nylons,
the wooden pegs she wore
in place of legs fit perfectly
into her unmarred shoes.

I cannot imagine him in the camp,
but I envision her
in a bomb shelter,
ten at most back then,
blonde hair done up in braids,
shoulders squared beneath a school uniform,
exhorting her playmates to stay calm
each time another blast
blew out the lights.

{Jewish Currents (Spring 2010)}


The following poems appear in 4 by Rosalie Calabrese, a Marymark Press Broa=
dside shared with 4 poems by Mark Sonnenfeld:

AT THE CROSSROADS

Waving her=0A pamphlets with the zeal of a sergeant,
a Watchtower woman in the Times Square station
roars above the break dancers=E2=80=99 din
at the troops geared for rush-hour battle.
=E2=80=9CFighting and killing among all nationalities!=E2=80=9D
=E2=80=9CRight here in the U. S.,=E2=80=9D she warns.
But the ear-plugged army
in its mad dash to the front lines
heeds only the call of an oncoming train.


GET THE MESSAGE

Sunday morning set aside
for newspaper and contemplation,
invaded by ghetto-blaster bulletins,
the rapper=E2=80=99s unintelligible words
thumping like jungle drums
telling me there is danger afoot,
telling me to read The Times
through his eyes and get the message.


WAITING FOR A CURE

More than anything right now
what I want is laughter,
the doubled-over-with-a-bellyache
jiggle-the-insides kind, a curative
with no destructive side effects,

but how to find such medicine
or, once found, to=0A think that it will work
when the whole world =E2=80=93
riddled with greed and fear
resulting from hubris of a high order =E2=80=93
seems incurably ill?

=E2=80=9CPooh,=E2=80=9D you say, while popping the latest pill
prescribed with the government=E2=80=99s blessing,
but I say pay attention to the exorbitant price:
even a deficiency of irony can be fatal.


ON THURSDAY

Tomorrow will be Friday
No matter what:
Even if the world
Comes to an end
It will be Friday =E2=80=94=C2=A0 =C2=A0
That's my guess.
If I should say
No more, that's it, finis,
It will be Friday
Nonetheless;
Like it or not,
Friday will be tomorrow
No matter what.

If you're thinking of attending the Paws for Poetry reading on June 4,
 please note:

June 4th falls on a Friday, not Sunday as
previously reported.

Also, the Host for the program will be Jason
 Bogdan.

Sorry about that.

usually I might make some flux-art from such an odd
discovery but no one (except for Janice, and I hate her),)
ended-up being very interested in my earlier offer of the
20-yr-old collected seashore pebbles rolling back and forth
on my car's dashboard (that I offered to exchange for a US$2
bill),, so I'm thinking the little discarded orange pencils
that I inexplicably discover pretty much in the same
sidewalk location nearly every day wouldn't be of much
interest either... (not really) sorry to have troubled
anyone at all: just check the a-for-animosity box on your
artworld-ballot (I'll still send you a pencil), and let's
finally dispense with all these horrid art-hostage-museums,
alright?...

I'm thinking back at what Chax Press & POG, either separately or =20
together, have presented to the Tucson community over the last 24 =20
years, and it's nothing short of remarkable. Readings by Robin Blaser, =20=

Robert Creeley, Bernadette Mayer, Harryette Mullen, Tom Raworth, Ron =20
Silliman, Alice Notley, Tracie Morris, Charles Bernstein, Eileen =20
Myles, Barbara Henning, Frank Parker, Dan Featherston, Tenney =20
Nathanson, Laynie Browne, Barbara Cully, and oh so many more. =20
Performance of plays by Leslie Scalapino, presentations of video by =20
Victor Masayesva, Paul Metcalf reading from the loft of the old Cafe =20
Magritte, Kit Robinson and Lyn Hejinian in residence together with =20
readings and workshops, Jackson Mac Low reading and giving an =20
inspiring small group workshop, and yes, oh so much more!

All of this, yet at this moment I can think of no event that means =20
more than one coming up. It's always the next reading that is your =20
next opportunity to be moved, to hear transformative language, to =20
glimpse possibilities that add to one's sense of the wonder of life =20
and of these arts.

I really hope you come to this reading. You will be glad you did. =20
Also, there will be food and drink, so please come a bit early, stay a =20=

bit late, talk with us. There will also be question and answer with =20
the poets, a chance to get to know how and why they do what they do, =20
and where it's taking us all.

This is one I want to share with all my friends, so please come!

BEVERLY DAHLEN & MARYROSE LARKIN
A POETRY READING presented by Chax Press

at The Drawing Studio
33 S 6th Ave, Tucson (on 6th Ave downtown, between Broadway & Congress)
7pm Saturday, May 22, 2010
FREE ADMISSION ( a donation will be requested )
Selected books available for purchase
Refreshment provided
Question & Answer Session following the reading
Call 520-620-1626 for more information

Chax Press events are funded in part by the Tucson Pima Arts Council =20
and by the Arizona Commission on the Arts, with funding from the State =20=

of Arizona and the National Endowment for the Arts. This event is also =20=

supported by Poets & Writers, Inc.

BEVERLY DAHLEN was born in Portland in November, 1934, attended public =20=

schools there, and after the end of World War II, moved with her =20
family to Eureka, California. In 1956, she resettled in San Francisco. =20=

Her first collection of poetry, Out of the Third, was published by =20
Momo's Press in 1974. Two chapbooks, A Letter at Easter (Effie's =20
Press) and The Egyptian Poems (Hipparchia Press) were followed in 1985 =20=

by the publication of A Reading 1-7 (Momo's Press). Since then, three =20=

more volumes of A Reading have appeared (including A Reading 8-10 from =20=

Chax Press), as well as the chapbook A-reading Spicer & Eighteen =20
Sonnets (Chax Press). Her essay "Beauty: Another Reading" recently =20
appeared in Crayon 5. Ms. Dahlen was a cofounder, with Kathleen Fraser =20=

and Frances Jaffer, of the influential avant feminist poetics =20
newsletter (HOW)ever ; in December of 2008 her work was honored by =20
Small Press Traffic with their annual Lifetime Achievement Award.

Beverly Dahlen is one of the major reasons I have been a poet, one of =20=

the great pleasures I have as a reader, one of the lights that keeps =20
me going as a publisher and human being. Her investigation is into the =20=

relation of language and language creation to being human. She is =20
funny, political, deeply psychological. She explores the vast =20
nothingness that exists in the universe, the unending dimensions of =20
time and space. She makes me laugh and cry, she makes me think about =20
what it is to think, what it is to be. She challenges me, and she =20
rewards that challenge immensely. Her readings are an invitation to =20
truly exist, i.e. to be there, listening and thinking, with all that =20
one has to give. That is what she does, and that is what she allows us =20=

to do.


MARYROSE LARKIN lives in Portland, Oregon, where she works as a =20
freelance researcher. She is the author of Inverse (nine muses books,=20
2006), Whimsy Daybook 2007 (FLASH+CARD, 2006), The Book of Ocean (i.e. =20=

press,2007) and DARC (FLASH+CARD, 2009). Larkin is one of the =20
organizers of Spare Room, a Portland-based writing collective, and is =20=

co-editor, with Sarah Mangold, of FLASH+CARD, a chapbook and ephemera =20=

poetry press. Her new book, The Name of This Intersection is Frost, is =20=

forthcoming from Shearsman Books.

Over the last decade, one of the poets who has most grasped my =20
attention, and who has given me delight and depth that is too often =20
missing, is undoubtedly Portland=92s Maryrose Larkin. She shapes =20
language into a universe that parallels and questions our own, in a =20
way that makes use of humor, open-endedness, and bold ideas. Mark =20
Wallace says that her latest book, The Book of Ocean, =93is one of the =20=

most significant books of poetry this year. Socially insightful and =20
emotionally resonant, The Book of Ocean develops a sophisticated =20
intellectual framework that shows Larkin to be a genuinely =20
philosophical poet. Central to the book is a sense of the world and =20
human experience in it as a kind of layering, almost a palimpsest like =20=

in the work of H.D., in which the peeling away of each layer reveals a =20=

further layer of significance. Sharply etched rhythms provide an edgy =20=

energy that makes the book=92s intellectual ambitions an aesthetic =20
pleasure as well. . . .
What The Book of Ocean finally shows is that writing poems can be a =20
way of engaging the interactive condition of the changeling. The =20
book=92s finely honed rhythms, alternately clipped and wave-like, never =20=

let either the repetitions of the ocean or the disconnection of the =20
fragment become dominant modes. The result is a book which enacts =20
processes of change on multiple levels and becomes itself a =20
significant example of its own theories.=94

and then I quit writing, says the old man

with the rentable typewriter. I was a tree obscuring the lake


He happily twitters his immense joy; his eyes leak.



                        Something

                        is kind of changing.


            When I blow on it, it moves.


            Surrounds cars

            as they move toward

            the completion of chores.


            It smells like dog food;

            a kind of meat with white

            fat and a bone in it; a keyboard.


            Like a thing

            waiting to lap-land.



When a Viking woman wanted a man and he died

she could throw her body on his pyre and be his wife in Valhalla.

Subject:      New Video Release: Okukin (please pass on)
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII; format=flowed

New Video Release:

Okukin

Okukin is a short, 9'23" video created from my recent work in Second Life.
There is a narrative among objects, slabs, planets, voices, bodies, and
images, some old, many new. The objects themselves have been created for
Okukin, which is filmed using the Beta 2 Second Life viewer release, in
order to take advantage of a number of new features.

The video opens on a scenic pouring-forth which changes in a few seconds
to planet surfaces and constructions which defy the laws of gravity,
opening on occasion to untoward vistas. The rest of the video develops
these vistas through symbolism and spoken or sung narrative that tends
towards a future anterior. The second video is a short test of emissions
that wasn't used in the final production, but is of great interest itself.
Perhaps I am becoming too literal; perhaps I am disappearing in these
works, which always seem on the verge of emergence, but never quite
coalesce into Being.

I hope to show this work at the June ELO conference in Providence, and
elsewhere of course. Participants, witting and unwitting, include Foofwa
d'Imobilite, Blue Carter, Kira Sedlock, and myself. Thanks to Fau
Ferdinand as well, for the use of the land in East Odyssey, as well as
Lizsolo and a number of people who helped with scripting.

The Tolerance Project: A Collaborative MFA

Rachel Zolf is working with 84 writers and artists on what could be the
first collaborative MFA ever. Reactions to this conceptual writing project
have ranged from lauding it as a long overdue Institutional Critique to
deriding it as an arrogant violation of the MFA workshop=B9s privacy and
sanctity. Zolf will talk about the origins of the project and its
challenges, describe how the collaborative poems emerge each week, and
reveal some of the traces of poetic DNA collected in The Tolerance Project
Archive.

Rachel Zolf=B9s fourth full-length book of poetry, Neighbour Procedure, was
recently released by Coach House Books. The Tolerance Project lives at

revived by the Cherry Lane Theatre in January 2007 and has been reproduced
around the world. He has been prolific across four decades, most recently,
his book of short stories, Tales of the Out & The Gone (Akashic Books) was
published in late 2007, Home, his book of social essays, was re-released by

Readers, writers, friends,

Hola, amigos! In addition to saying thank you for hanging with us
last month at AWP, we have a few new goodies to tell you about:
1) new titles; 2) forthcoming titles; 3) a ridiculously huge
sale (up to $9 cheaper than Amazon) on every one of our backlist
paperbacks; and 4) an update on submissions to Tarpaulin Sky
Literary Journal, as well as a reminder as to where to follow
TSky news/blogs, etc.

First, we have not one but  four new titles
[http://www.tarpaulinsky.com/Press/catalog.html] available:

Traci O Connor's Recipes for Endangered Species
[http://www.tarpaulinsky.com/Press/Connor/index.html], a
collection of short fictions (along with photos and cocktail
recipes) that are populated by infanticidal mothers and sentient
amputated limbs, but that manage also to be "tender, aching love
stories" (Publishers Weekly);

Joanna Ruocco's Man's Companions
[http://www.tarpaulinsky.com/Press/Ruocco/index.html], short
fictions with a "playful, experimental appeal" (Publishers
Weekly), combining "the obsessive music of Lydia Davis and the
stripped precision of Muriel Spark" (Brian Evenson)--ultrasmart
and rather hilarious meditations on everything from the best
iconic buildings from which to hurl oneself, to the myriad
penises wandering the isles of a minimart;

Kim Gek Lin Short's The Bugging Watch & Other Exhibits
[http://www.tarpaulinsky.com/Press/Short/index.html], a "catacomb
valentine" (Selah Saterstrom), a surreal and darkly gorgeous
necromance--a "twisted" (Joyelle McSweeney) "perverse fairy-tale
" (Bhanu Kapil) in the form of a prose-poem-novella that combines
"the exactitude of obsessive compulsion" with " the imagery and
dimness of an opiate trip sponsored by Lewis Caroll" (New Pages)
, and that is quite literally crawling with bugs, thanks to
artist Daniel Rhodes;

and  Shelly Taylor's Black-Eyed Heifer
[http://www.tarpaulinsky.com/Press/Taylor/index.html], a "a
mighty anthem to down home local culture" (Brenda Iijima) and a
"radically innovative use of language" (Jim Harrison), an avant
-Southern hybrid hailing from syntactic hinterlands where the
farm meets the backlot of the Piggly Wiggly.

All of these titles are available via  Amazon
[http://www.amazon.com]
and other major booksellers, but you'll save a bundle (shipping
is always included) by  ordering directly from TSky Press

Thanks to our chapbook and full-length manuscript reading periods
, 2010 and 2011 will see the publication of books and chapbooks
by Lara Glenum, Johannes G=C3=B6ransson, Sarah Goldstein, and James
Haug . (We are still hoping to add another full-length title as
well, as we have a couple dozen manuscripts which we can neither
publish nor bring ourselves to relinquish just yet.) Emily
Toder's chapbook is still scheduled for 2010, and 2011 will also
see the publication of our second book from Jenny Boully, not
merely because of the unknown that was stalking toward them.

And, now, the part you've all been waiting for, the Almost-Summer

And last but not least, we'd like to say thank you for your
February submissions to  Tarpaulin Sky
[http://www.tarpaulinsky.com]. Wow! We reduced our reading period
to one month only, just to cut down on numbers, and we still
received 2,481 submissions! It's going to take our editors a
little while to make their way through all of these, but rest
assured, they're on the case.

S/N: NewWorldPoetics
http://www.snnewworldpoetics.com/

is a quarterly journal dedicated to the poetries of the Americas and to
South/North [S/N] dialog. In each issue we will publish poetry and
poetics in English or Spanish translation, introducing North American
readers to Latin American poetry and vice versa. Our commitment is to a
poetics of invention and exploration. This also defines our approach to
translation, which we see not as an expedient but as an art form in
itself. S/N will present work that challenges received conventions about
poetry and poetics – but not necessarily in the predictable ways of the
avant-garde, bohemian, or dissident. The poetry and poetics we present
is meant to open up new understandings of poetic invention and formal
exploration, in works that are as wild and unpredictable as Our Americas.

América la poesía de América Latina, y viceversa. Nuestro compromiso es
con las poéticas de invención y exploración. Esto también define nuestra
concepción de la traducción, a la cual no vemos como una simple
mediadora sino como una forma de arte por sí misma. S/N presentará obras
que desafían las convenciones pre-existentes sobre la poesía, aunque no
necesariamente a la manera predecible de las vanguardias, la bohemia, o
la disidencia. La poesía y poéticas que publicaremos están pensadas y
concebidas para inaugurar nuevos entendimientos de la invención poética
y de la exploración formal, en obras que son tan salvajes e
impredecibles como Nuestras Américas.

ASIMINA CHREMOS was born in 1966 in Toronto, Canada and is a naturalized US=
 citizen. Her mother was raised in the state of Virginia in the USA and her=
 father is a native of Central Greece. Since childhood, Chremos has brought=
 playful curiosity and incisive intelligence to her exploration of dance as=
 a creative practice, lifestyle, career and evolving philosophy. Approachin=
g dance as art, she creates abstractions, narratives and kinetic sculptural=
 forms across stages, studios and spaces of all types and sizes. Recent pro=
jects include daily dance vlog CircadianDancer; site specific performances =
as microgig with cellist Fred Lonberg-Holm; and Echo Den, a sound-and-movem=
ent duo with vocalist Carol Genetti. In July 2010 Chremos will leave Chicag=
o and travel around the country and beyond to create, perform and teach.

JOSEPH RAVENS creates time-based art works that encompass text, movement, i=
nstallation, technology, costume, and object. Touching on subjects such as =
materialism, insatiability, conformity, and alienation, his performances re=
flect a struggle to find pattern and purpose within an imposing and random =
universe. A graduate of The School of the Art Institute of Chicago with an =
MFA in Performance, Ravens has a BFA in Theater and studied audio/visuals a=
t Gerrit Reitvelt Acadamie in Amsterdam, Holland. Joseph is committed to pr=
esenting his work globally. To learn more, please visit http://www.josephra=

ALYCIA SCOTT has performed around the globe in spaces ranging from theaters=
 in Russia to balconies in Guatemala, a graveyard in Mexico and art galleri=

vement to understand and engage kinesics to connect people, and instigate c=
hange. She continually studies ritual movement, from West African Dance and=
 Butoh, to yoga and daily routines of both the ancient and modern world. As=
 a curator and arts administrator, she has developed projects and exhibitio=
ns that engage communities, both local and global, in addressing socio-poli=
tical issues from women=E2=80=99s rights to food production, the state of w=

Red Rover Series is curated by Laura Goldstein and Jennifer Karmin. Each ev=

Versal 8 is now available

On May 8th, the eighth edition of Versal, the Netherlands' only
international literary journal, was launched at the Sugar Factory club in
Amsterdam. This is the largest issue of Versal so far, and arguably the most
visually gorgeous, with cover art by renowned American artist Kerri
Rosenstein, and, inside its pages, more color artwork than ever before, from
artists including Michael Genovese and Kim Holleman.

The work of widely celebrated writers, including Laura Mullen, Maureen
Seaton, and Selah Saterstrom, sits alongside writing by exciting emerging
names such as Karen An-hwei Lee, Brandon Shimoda and Colleen Hollister. As
in previous editions, Versal 8's contributor list is resolutely
international; writers appearing here in English translation, some for the
first time, include renowned poets Carlos Barbarito (Argentina), Chung
Ho-Seung (South Korea) and Carlos Pardo (Spain). This issue once again
breaks linguistic, national, and cultural borders to bring together the wide
range of artistry happening in our contemporary milieu.

About *Ozalid*:

"Biswamit=92s poems arrive and depart simultaneously, or at least give an
impression of being both a trail ahead and a trail behind a moving
figure. This seems to me to be a cosmic figure, in the spirit of Jesus,
because of its gleam and disappearance. What is thrown, like wheat or gold,
flies, falls, vanishes but leaves marks. The marks are all we have to judge
the figure by. I guess that is called a sleight of hand? This is the way I
understand them, in any case, and feel their pain as being a suffusion of
which there is no more or less than what is written."

***************************

POSIE RIDER: I started writing poems as soon as I could write ... I began
writing songs, plays, and novels around age 10, and still have many of thos=
e
things. Although I continued writing novels until I was 15 or so, and I
still dabble in prose fiction, I decided at the ripe old age of 12 that I
had conquered all forms of writing except poetry and that my major energies
would focus on that genre. Find me at ladiesalone.blogspot.com xxx

Home & Away is a 2010 trans-Tasman poetic interchange conducted by Pam
Brown, Martin Edmond, Brian Flaherty and Michele Leggott, with real
time meetings in Auckland (April) and Sydney (September), and the
Digital Bridge has many fine vehicles on it.

For the Tomorrowland CD, I am using voice, musical instruments, and
noise chance to form soundscapes that accompany the reading aloud of
the book. My thanks to Tim Page for his sound recording, mixing, and
editing expertise.

Live Landscape by Andrey Gritsman

Andrey Gritsman is a poet and essayist, born and raised in Russia. He lives=
 in New York City and works as a physician. He has been widely published in=
 Russia, including five collections of poetry. Poems, essays and translatio=
ns in English have appeared in Manhattan Review, New Orleans Review, Denver=
 Quarterly, Notre Dame Review, Poet Lore, South Carolina Review and many ot=
hers and were anthologized in Modern Poetry in Translation (UK), in Crossin=
g Centuries (New Generation in Russian Poetry), The Breath of Parted Lips: =
Voices from the Robert Frost Place and in Stranger at Home: American Poetry=
 with an Accent . Collections of poetry and essays Long Fall was published =
by Spuyten Duyvil in 2004 and recent poetry collection PISCES by Numina Pre=
ss. Andrey=E2=80=99s work was nominated for the Pushcart Prize in 2005, 200=
6 and 2007 and was on the short list for the Joyce Osterweil/PEN American C=
enter Prize in Poetry in 2005. He runs the Intercultural Poetry Series in a=
 popular literary club Cornelia Street Caf=C3=A9 and edits international po=
etry magazine INTERPOEZIA .=20

Andrey Gritsman is quite literally a groundbreaking poet. From Moscow to Ne=
w York is a steep distance but Gritsman makes us aware of the threads that =
link seemingly disparate occasions. Fresh perceptions create new styles and=
 Gritsman=E2=80=99s is more than a synthesis of two cultures: it is an art =
that probes delusions and pleasures by a poet who has been around some daun=
ting blocks.=20
=E2=80=94Baron Wormser, author of Good Trembling and many other collections=
 of poetry.=20

Andrey Gritsman=E2=80=99s poems are unwavering in their honesty, relentless=
 in their assessment of contemporary life, and clear-eyed in their approach=
 to human love and mortality. We instantly recognize the terrain he is nego=
tiating. Perhaps only Gritsman, with his unprejudiced immigrant=E2=80=99s e=
ye, can describe the empty, arid landscape of the American West. These are =
poems that peer into the abyss behind the official public happiness of Amer=
ican life, the compulsion to be always hopeful, positive and bubbling over =
with good spirits. That is to say: they are real poems, and make no accommo=
dation with fanciful dreams. Read =E2=80=98em, and weep.=20
=E2=80=94Kurt Brown, poet, editor of several anthologies, founder, Aspen Wr=
iters=E2=80=99 Seminar=20

Gritsman=E2=80=99s poems are tenderness in transit. They fully inhabit thei=
r evoked circumstances so that their significance keeps expanding and reson=
ating before the quality of attention given over to them. He so quickly is =
able to penetrate to the depths in the poems, it is as though working with =
a large, oiled, sharp shovel while the rest of us are working with miniatur=
e dull and rusty spoons. The use of brevity in some of these poems remind m=
e of my beloved Denise Levertov. His poems are =E2=80=9Ctime-flooded=E2=80=
=9D and remind me that whether we look backward or forward in time always t=
he beloved figures are diminishing, disappearing, and the shadow growing fr=
om our own foot soles moves among the company of many other shadows. =E2=80=
=9CConstant departure,=E2=80=9D as he says it, is our state, and all we can=
 do is stand for our count, make our song, and salute each other.=20
=E2=80=94Jeanne Marie Beaumont, author of Curious Conduct (BOA Editions)=20

FOR MY FATHER=20

After you've been gone,=20
I've been flying alone back and forth=20
above the waters and the continents.=20
Both of us: me here and you there=20
know too well that this is a waste of time=20
and space.=20
I may be flying, looking for you=20
for the rest of my life=20
or death, and still never see you.=20

Nothing can be undone,=20
and I can't take it.=20
Nor I can take the fact=20
that every time I see my close ones, I know,=20
it may be the last time I see them.=20

Don't worry about me. While I fly,=20
an angel in uniform attends me,=20
gives me some water and bread,=20
and smiles to me.=20
She takes care of me=20
until it's time to get out,=20
get in line for the luggage=20
and then to disappear into crowd=20
which lives on the exhaust,=20
cyclic persistence=20
and canned expectations.=20

The latter is something=20
I live on myself, expectation=20
melting slowly into waiting=20
as I keep on flying=20
in the space given=20
for the time being.=20

Dear Friends of Big Bridge,=20

We are pleased to announce the final Supplement of Big Bridge's Epic =
Tribute to New Orleans. When we set out to offer this tribute to the =
magical and great City of New Orleans we had no idea it would take two =
years and three installments. Gratitude to Jack Krick and Mary Sands =
Woodbury for webmastering us through this enormity. And thank you for =
your patience in allowing this tribute to evolve. There is no shortage =
of wonders to be found within!

Love to you all! And LONG LIVE NEW ORLEANS!!!

2009 SUPPLEMENT



CHAPBOOK:=20
A Time in Fragments
Poem by Clark Coolidge; Drawings by Nancy Victoria Davis

FEATURES



Big Bridge New Orleans Sturm und Drang Anthology. Edited by Dave Brinks =
and Bill Lavender. Introductory notes for work by 30 artists and 90 =
writers.



Slow Poetry Edited by Dale Smith . One of the most refreshing and =
promising developments in poetry in recent years, Slow Poetry does not =
propose another sectarian or clique position, but rather methods of =
reading and attitudes toward production which could apply to most genres =
in the current scene or likely to emerge in the near future. The =
approach has a strong base in concepts and needs made more apparent than =
ever by current ecological and economic concerns.


Beauty Came Groveling Forward: Selected South African Poems and Stories. =
Edited by Gary Cummiskey. This collection was meant to show the =
diversity and spirited character of current South African writing. It =
contains work by some celebrated writers, and some whose work has not =
received wide circulation even in its home country. Without the problems =
caused by canon formation or trying to be totally comprehensive, this =
group of poems and stories is free to work outside the stereotypes and =
preconceptions of South Africa and allow the participants to show what =
they can do as individuals.=20



All This Strangeness: A Garland for George Oppen. Edited by Eric =
Hoffman. Commentary on Oppen has grown slowly, unobtrusively, and =
steadily, until it now forms a major body in itself. This collection of =
essays evaluates that body of criticism in less partisan terms than many =
of its predecessors, seeking to focus on individual poems and prosody in =
a broad historical context, going beyond the dichotomies that dominated =
the 20th Century and making room for further types of relevance in =
current literary and social dispensations.



Sephardic Proverbs. Collected and translated by Michael Castro. Proverbs =
act on many of the same principles as other miniatures, such as haiku. =
Like stand-alone couplets and quatrains used in everything from toasts =
to insults, they also include a strong element of collaboration and =
evolution. As a look at a tradition or a type of poem, this collection =
can stay with a reader a long time.



Post-Beat Anthology. Reprint from the Chinese anthology, with brief =
intro. Edited by Vernon Frazer. How would you edit a collection of poems =
with that title for a Chinese audience? Probably not the same way Frazer =
has. That's one of the things that makes it interesting and refreshing.=20



as per Le Roman de la Rose, for example. An Anthology of Middle East =
Genocide Edited by Arpine Konyalian Grenier How does the cruel and =
unusual work for you through art, whether it comes from direct =
experience or direct/indirect memory. Be Genet, for example; lemon to =
lemonade, for example. How does one turn to Le Roman de la Rose (a =
Middle Ages Poem) when one is mired in or sorting out or faced with what =
happened or what is happening that is cruel and unusual due to human =
intolerance: racial religious cultural gender related and other.=20



Charles Olson and the Nature of Destructive Humanism by Craig Stormont=20



One Man Blues: Remembering Thomas Chapin. Reminiscence by Vernon Frazer=20



Excerpt from Autobiography by David Bromige=20

The India Journals by John Brandi=20



Genius and Heroin: by Michael Largo. In this essay, the author reviews =
his own book. The themes of psycho-chemistry may stretch back to =
pristine civilizations in China, Egypt, and Mexico, but they seem =
inexhaustible. Perhaps associate chemicals with genius is because our =
brains produce such sophisticated bases to start with, and self-review =
also finds a base in that phenomenon.=20



WAR PAPERS (3)
Poems and essays against war. Sub-features by John Bradley, Joel Lewis, =
Philip Metres, Vincent Katz, Francesco Levato, and Louise Landes Levi, =
plus reflections from around the world on the election of Barack Obama, =
and, of course, Halvard Johnson's continuing anthology of anti-war =
poems.=20


A Retrospective of the Publication Work of Karl Young



ART

Enigmas paintings by Jim Spitzer. As a regular contributor to Big =
Bridge, these paintings, variations on an enigmatic theme, show =
Spitzer's continuing evolution, as well as being koan-like meditations =
in their own right.


The Kingdom of Madison: Photographs from Madison County, North Carolina
by Rob Amberg. Selections from three sets of photos, exploring a still =
relatively isolated place, where landscape still has functional meaning. =
When Amberg arrived, not as a tourist, but as one seeking community =
"Planting was still done by the signs of the moon. Water came from =
springs and heat from forests" and traditional music still part of daily =
life. These photos add to the tradition begun in the WPA projects of the =
Great Depression, but decidedly retain an identity of their own.


These Are My Angels by Tasha Robbins. Small paintings done in Brooklyn =
on found cardboard by one of the Post-Katrina diaspora. Celebrating the =
C-Train stop at Franklin + Fulton Avenues, as the artist writes, they =
"kept my heart, eye + hand moving with a spirit of life close to the =
timbre and vibration of the Crescent City, still healing. . .


Lectura en Tr=E1nsito. Project Created and Directed by Carmen Gloria =
Berr=EDos. Set based on combination of public art and poetry from =
Santiago de Chile. Poems translated by Terri Carrion and Carmen Gloria =
Berr=EDos.=20


Animal Night Photography by Felicia Murray; notes by Louise Landes Levi. =
New techniques in photography allow us to make photographic images of =
phenomena we could only imagine in previous eras. We might debate =
whether the nature of cameras and software brings us any closer to the =
spiritual world, but these haunting images of animals should make us =
feel less alone, and more in touch with the continuum of life.


12 Collages by John Brandi. These colages can be read as a non-verbal =
counterpart and extension of his India Journal and related work.



FICTION

Fiction by Mel Freilicher, Eric Beeny, Stefani Christova, Lynda Schor, =
David Madgalene, Stephen-Paul Martin, Mark Wallace, Susan Smith Nash, =
Richard Martin, Peter Conners, Ann Bogle, Jeffrey Hansen, Carol Novack=20

ROCKPILE. ROCKPILE is a collaboration between David Meltzer =97 poet, =
musician, essayist, and more =97 and Michael Rothenberg of Big Bridge =
Press. David and Michael will journey through eight cities in the U.S. =
to perform poetry and prose, composed while on the road, with local =
musicians and artists in each city. ROCKPILE will serve to educate and =
preserve as well as to create a history of collaboration. It will help =
to reinforce the tradition of the troubadour of all generations, central =
to the cultural upheaval and identity politics that reawakened poets, =
artists, musicians, and songwriters in the mid-1960s through the 1970s. =
The project will end with a final multimedia performance in San =
Francisco. Check out the ROCKPILE Blog for calendar and discussion!

usually I might make some flux-art from such an odd
discovery but no one (except for Janice, and I hate her),)
ended-up being very interested in my earlier offer of the
20-yr-old collected seashore pebbles rolling back and forth
on my car's dashboard (that I offered to exchange for a US$2
bill),, so I'm thinking the little discarded orange pencils
that I inexplicably discover pretty much in the same
sidewalk location nearly every day wouldn't be of much
interest either... (not really) sorry to have troubled
anyone at all: just check the a-for-animosity box on your
artworld-ballot (I'll still send you a pencil), and let's
finally dispense with all these horrid art-hostage-museums,
alright?...

Hello

In publishing this poem before, I encountered several production =
problems. On a previous revision the text I prepared turned fuzzy whenI =
published it to YouTube. I've redone the piece and reformatted the text =
so that you can read it clearly during the performance. I apologize for =
the frequent posts on this matter and hope you'll enjoy what I hope is =
the final take.

Edoardo Sanguineti, Italian Poet, 79, Dies
By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
Filed at 4:36 p.m. ET=20

ROME (AP) -- Edoardo Sanguineti, a poet, critic and intellectual whose =
playful use of language made him an important neo-avant-garde figure on =
Italy's 1960s literary scene, died on Tuesday in a Genoa hospital.=20

Doctors at Villa Scassi hospital said Sanguineti, 79, died there =
following emergency surgery for an abdominal aneurysm.=20

In the early 1960s, Sanguineti helped found and influence the so-called =
''Gruppo 63,'' in which experimental poetry explored what he considered =
the ''dissolution'' of daily language.=20

In a tribute, President Giorgio Napolitano recalled how he came to know =
and appreciate Sanguineti when the two were Communist lawmakers in =
Parliament from 1979-1983. State TV said Sanguineti liked to call =
himself ''the last Marxist.''=20

Feltrinelli, which published much of his work, hailed him as a =
''stubborn and intelligent critical conscience of our time, a craftsman =
of language and formidable poet of provocation and play.''=20

Sanguineti, who was born in Genoa in 1930, was an expert on Dante, =
taught literature at several Italian universities, wrote plays and =
essays as well as poems.=20

His first book of poetry, ''Laborintus,'' was published in 1956, and he =
went on to publish several more volumes, as well as two novels.=20

Culture Minister Sandro Bondi hailed Sanguineti as a ''fundamental voice =
of Italian literature in the latter half of the 20th century.'' =
Sanguineti often imbued his poetry ''with civil and political =
commitment, as in the best 20th century tradition,'' Bondi said.=20

In a recent interview, Sanguineti said the role of the poet is, in some =
way, to help explain the world. He was particularly passionate about =
class struggle, recently lamenting that ''the political situation is =
disastrous, with a mass of proletarians and underclass proletarians in =
extreme difficulty, and who no longer are aware that they are.''=20

Barbara Godard, 1942 =AD 2010

On Sunday evening, literary critic, cultural theorist and translator Dr.
Barbara Godard passed away in Toronto. The author of over 200 articles (som=
e
reprinted in her 2008 book, Canadian Literature at the Crossroads of
Language and Culture) and editor of several edited collections, Barbara
played a major role in creating new critical approaches to Canadian and
Quebecois writing, especially innovative women=B9s writing. Barbara was deepl=
y
committed to working in collaboration with colleagues and students as well
as writers, artists and activists. In 1984, she founded the journal Tessera
with Daphne Marlatt, Gail Scott and Kathy Mezei. For many years, she served
on the editorial board of Open Letter. In addition to her research and
writing, Barbara supervised several generations of Canadian literary critic=
s
and cultural studies scholars. She will continue to have a tremendous impac=
t
on Canadian literature and culture, both terrains she helped to write.

Many many thanks Vernon! it's a revelation to hear/see you perform vocally
and with the bass the pieces--s it opens up to one the true sense of your
notations--which when rading them on my own--i would always wonder in what
ways you heard them, and how you saw the relationship between the
arrangements of the words and the arrangements-of the msuciality of them, as
in all your works music is always so vidily present--
truly, my deepest thanks--

We're playing at Linger Cafe in Brooklyn this Sunday - Come if you can!

- Alan, Azure, Myk -

The AMA group - Myk Freedman, Alan Sondheim, and Azure Carter - will
perform at Linger, May 23rd, at 5 pm. Their music is improvised, drawing
on a number of traditions, but emphasizing pushing the instruments to the
limit.  Carter sings (her own pieces) against a backdrop of free music;
Freedman plays lap steel and steel-string guitar, and Sondheim plays
electric oud and saz, cura cumbus, hegelung and guitar.

This trio is really something, and more unlike anything you've heard before than all that.  Carter's uncanny and beautiful vocals (including, i think, some of Alan's writing you may have seen here, hyper digital text turned uncannily slow and vocal) linger over a first-rate string band -- Sondheim has the fastest hand/mind in the city, and Freedman's studied melodic sense sculpts it all into some kind of perverted song-forms.  I've seen them play together now 3 times, and each time I was astonished.

Poets for Living Waters is a poetry action in response to the Gulf Oil Disa=
ster of April 20, 2010, one of the most profound man-made ecological catast=
rophes in history. Former US poet laureate Robert Pinsky describes the popu=
larity of poetry after 9/11 as a turn away from the disaster=E2=80=99s over=
whelming enormity to a more manageable individual scale. As we confront the=
 magnitude of this recent tragedy, such a return may well aid us.The first =
law of ecology states that everything is connected to everything else.  An =
appreciation of this systemic connectivity suggests a wide range of poetry =
will offer a meaningful response to the current crisis, including work that=
 harkens back to Hurricane Katrina and the ongoing regional effects. This o=
nline periodical is the first in a planned series of actions.  Further acti=
ons will include a print anthology and a public reading in Washington DC. I=

Implicitly comparing a book to a deck of cards, and that deck of cards in
turn to the world of social violence we=92re dealt, Crag Hill stakes his an=
te
on the power of poetry to witness and document the multiply-layered,
self-inflicted insanity of US daily life in the Bush years. As readers we
become participants and are thus empowered to say no to the game of death. =
=97
*Maria Damon*



One of the most important things I look for in poetry is something I can
believe=97something without posturing or postmodern cynicism or post-anythi=
ng
for that matter: something that stands outside of facile labels, something
(disorientingly/ seemingly) simple that makes me *see* and *hear *and
*feel*=97and
more importantly, makes me believe=97in the world, in poetry, in the proces=
s
of* poesis. *Crag Hill=92s poems make me believe and listen=97and more
importantly=97make me *want *to listen. And best of all, they are far from
simple and believe in a chance-laden process. They *make *our world*.  *The=
se
are poems fiercely engaged with/in our current and tragic socio/
political/ecological moment and I am deeply grateful for them, because
gratitude is the beginning of understanding. These poems remind me that rag=
e
and discontent is the genesis of change, that "death is death"=97such a
necessary reminder in times of such alienation from it. Let us now go make
and change, listening to this poet=92s example. =97*Christopher Arigo*



"Scattered parts/now lie about what happened."  *7 X 7* parses the dizzying
bomb crater sized duplicities of the thoroughly mediated, mediatized and
militarized zeitgeist which we have collectively dealt ourselves into. Crag
Hill is looking to see where the proverbial chips are falling. And he's
playing with a full deck. =97*Tom Beckett*

Many, many thanks to you in return for your kind words.

In 1985, when I heard Ted Enslin read, I realized that hearing poets reci=
te their work,=20
their rhythms and inflections, enabled me to understand it more quickly.

I've often felt that my own work needed a mixed-media presentation--recit=
ation, music=20
and a readable text-- to enable the reader to relate to my work in the fu=
llest way=20
possible. The Poetry Band I had about 20 years ago covered some of that g=
round. After=20
the Poetry Band ended, my poetry started to incorporate the contrapuntal =
and polytonal=20
melodies I used to hear around me when I performed with the band, only in=
 the form of=20
language. So I started writing what I've called "orchestrated text."

In IMPROVISATIONS I mentioned the late Julius Hemphill's Coon Bidness bec=
ause many of=20
the multi-voiced lines in teh book seem to come togeher in the way the sa=
xophones did=20
on his recording.=20

I'm very pleased that the performance helped you see how my work fits tog=
ether.=20
Sometimes I think I'm a musician in a writer's body. When Ottone M. Ricci=
o did a spin on=20
Pound by saying, in effect, poetry is music made with language, I began t=
o write from=20
that sensibility and poetry came much more easily to me than it had befor=
e.

So, when you (or anybody, I guess) look at my work, knowing that music of=
 some kind is=20
always at its core would (I hope) help "explain" the text.=20

Again, I thank you for your praise of my work and for posting this. You'v=
e certainly made=20
my day.

Best,

Vernon

The Center for the Humanities

abozicevic@gc.cuny.edu
April 28, 2010
For Immediate release:
Printed in elegant, stapled editions, the inaugural chapbook series of
Lost & Found: The CUNY Poetics Document Initiative activates and puts
into wider circulation important but little known texts drawn from
personal and institutional archives.
An ongoing publication project emerging from archival and textual
scholarship done by students, faculty and guest fellows at the Graduate
Center, the primary focus of Lost & Found is on writers who fall under
the rubric of the New American Poetry. Since enhanced accessibility to a
broad spectrum of archival material helps create alternative, divergent
and enriched versions of literary and cultural history, the Lost & Found
initiative takes the “New American” rubric writ large, including the
affiliated and unaffiliated, precursors and followers. The first set
includes correspondence, essays, and journal selections:
Amiri Baraka & Edward Dorn: Selections from the Collected Letters
1959-1960, ed. Claudia Moreno Pisano, includes letters written between
1959 and 1960 and covers a wide-range of discussions, “from quotidian
observations of being snowbound without enough heat...to the hashing out
of experiences, fears, and anxieties directly related to the
socio-political culture of the early 1960s”.
The Correspondence of Kenneth Koch & Frank O’Hara 1955-1956, Part I and
II, ed. Josh Schneiderman, includes “letters [...] written over an
eighteen-month period from1955 to 1956 [that] provide an account of the
poets’ important, if often overlooked, friendship. Full of poems,
literary gossip, and nods to artistic influences, Koch and O’Hara’s
correspondence also chronicles a key moment in what would come to be
known as the New York School of poets”.
Darwin & The Writers, Muriel Rukeyser, ed. Stefania Heim, is an
unpublished essay about Darwin (rejected by The Nation in 1959). “The
piece is an exercise in the discovery, collection, and exposition of
“meeting-places” between scientific and literary imaginations, extending
the intellectual work Rukeyser started in works like Willard Gibbs and
The Life of Poetry.”
1957-1977 Selections from the Journals Part I and II, Philip Whalen, ed.
Brian Unger, is comprised of entries from Whalen’s Journals from two key
periods in his life: the mid to late 1950s following the public
recognition of the Beats, and the early 1970s, after his return from
Japan and his decision to live in a Zen monastery.
The 1963 Vancouver Poetry Conference / Robert Creeley’s Contexts of
Poetry, with Daphne Marlatt’s Journal Entries, ed. Ammiel Alcalay, is a
Creeley lecture and conversation with Allen Ginsberg. Contexts of Poetry
is from the landmark 1963 Vancouver Poetry Conference, with excerpts from
the journals of the prominent Canadian poet Daphne Marlatt, chronicling
her attendance as a student.
Together, the set marks an auspicious beginning to a project that brings
the finest traditions of small press publication and textual scholarship
to a broader reading public.
We are delighted to announce that the chapbooks are available at
bookstores across the nation, from St. Marks Books to City Lights.
Books may be ordered online at
www.centerforthehumanitiesgc.org/lostandfound where they are on sale for
$10 per issue, $35 per set, and $25 per subscription. On Monday and
Tuesday, May 3rd and 4th, 10 a.m.—8 p.m., the set of chapbooks will also
be available for purchase at the Center for Humanities’ Annual Chapbook
Festival. Look for the Lost & Found table. More information and a
schedule for the festival are available at www.chapbookfestival.org.

=97Greenpoint, Brooklyn's Nellie Bridge
with "Sticky"

Leaves that fall on New York sidewalks stick there

The light green-gray confetti grows denser

You say you want to be a conquistador, but what about microbial lag? =20
On the other hand,
how will we learn of caramelization or chiaroscuro if we don=92t venture =

"Introduction to Diplomacy"

Authenticity is beside the point, unless judiciously employed as an =20

impulses must be properly restrained.


=97Bedford Stuyvesant, Brooklyn's Austin LaGrone
with "Lunchbreak Yodel for Elkhorn Sanitation"

Someone=92s put chicken fingers
inside my work gloves
as if the jaws of a garbage truck
could translate for the hunger of kings.


"Epiphany"
I=92ve worked these street for years,
lingered over blue plates chatting up
waitresses, spruced-up three Chevy=92s
with dice and chrome ladies, and never,
not once, fallen in love. My God,
your toe ring with its moonstones
and blisters, your lip gloss
moving beyond the reasonable
borders of mouth, the burn marks
around the bathtub where you fall
asleep dreaming. It=92s so sexy.


"Overtime"
That evening the late shift was even later,
paid time and a half, kept him upright
another three hours sweeping up the plant.
With the shimmy of the line silenced,
there was only the percussion of his pushbroom
and the steady moan of fluorescents
for company. =93Times like these,=94 he said
aloud, =93a man might start talking to himself.=94

(my apologies if you're receiving this multiple times...)

The Gig has just published *Buber's Bag Man, *a new chapbook by Frederick
Farryl Goodwin, author of *Virgil's Cow *(Miami University Press, 2009).
It's 32pp of ecstatic high lyric leaking out of the holes left by
typographical damage and Shakespearean/familial psychodrama: a concentrated
dose of the ragged sublime. I'll post one poem below; you can find a second
one on the website at http://www.ndorward.com/poetry/books/goodwin_bbm.htm.

MIME-Version: 1.0

Dear Vernon:

thank you so much for your response!
reading it i thought of Mallarme, who i have spent some time studying on my
own of late, in part to find out how he arrived at the composition of Un
Coup de des (A throw of the Dice), which is often cited as being the "first
modern visual poem."

When i first came across some of your Improvisations a few years ago, i was
immediately aware of the interrelationships of the visual layouts of the
words, phrases, lines to the rhythms and sounds of the words. The sense of
the pieces I read reminded me a lot of the improvisations in Free Jazz,
among other forms of improvisatory music, as there is a recurring "theme"
expressed sonically, or visually or as a recurring idea--or al three at
once--around and in and out of on top and below of--are played the
improvisations which seize upon a particular note or thought or sensation
and expand it, adding color to it, dancing with it, expanding or trimming
it--and tossing it back to the source, which brings about another
improvisation which may go on back and forth for quite some time, or be
played with for just a brief passage as passage of both time and of a text,
a notation, since improvisations are often built up with layers of
allusions, quotations, references, to works outside the piece itself as well
to particulars within the work as it is developing. This density which can
be achieved by layerings of quotations and then puns upon them which open
them out into wholly new series of sounds and visual layouts, of new
thoughts which challenge the old which have been quoted, perhaps--this
density can be increased or all of a sudden completely dispensed with in a
flight of pure lyricism--

Often American performed/improvised poetry with music since the Beats say,
has been very influenced by Jazz--but often the notations themselves of the
words read do not look anything different from a conventionally printed poem
which could just as well be read in a non-musical setting. One often finds,
post the Beats, poems with visual layouts which seem arbitrary, disconnected
from the actual sounds of the words, as though tacked on to generate some
"sideshow" interest or suggestion of a "look" meant to be "experimental."
What seems to be something very simple actually is quite a bit more
complex--a good way to study the notations of sound as visual pieces is to
study the notations and scores employed by Sound Poets, as well as in some
cases, Visual Poets who use the Visuals to be sounded out as Sound Poetry.
Notations in these senses need n0ot even by written as words or even in
letters, but using some other system or some completely arbitrary method.
Bob Cobbing for example would perform poems by simply feeling a rock in his
hands, exploring the textures and shapes and expressing sonically what the
fingers, the touch, experienced and found.  Walking with Bob, we would use
side walk cracks and shadows of trees on the sidewalk as the notations for
performance. There being an underlying structure in the pale cement at the
same distances of the lines in a sidewalk, not counting the cracks, one has
already the basis for a theme around which to improvise--

The experience of your work and of some others led me to wanting to find out
more about the origins of this interrelationship of the Visual layout of
words and punctuation marks on the page with the sounds not only of words as
words having meanings, but of words themselves as simply sounds, working and
flowing together like music--

This is what led me to Mallarme, a poet who i knew someday i would
encounter, so had not previously made  conscious effort to study him other
than reading his poetry until the right time found me and i found it--and
this was it--

I thought to share with you some of the things I found in my rummaging about
in my little collection of the poet's works in French and English
editions--perhpas it may be of interest and use--

Mallarme, like a great many French poets beginning with Baudelaire, was very
much impressed by the conceptions of Wagner, (and wrote a very fascinating
essay on the composer's work), not only with the idea of the
"gesamtkunstwerke" (total art work or total work of art; in which many have
found also the  example of a "totalitarian" work of art--)-but also
examples, materials, which coincided at various levels with the poet's own
ideas regarding music and poetry. The first expression of these ideas is to
be found in the "poeme critique" "The Book as Spiritual Instrument." "Poem
critique" was a new form invented by Mallarme in which the essay and the
prose poem meet, thus announcing not only a new style of writing, but of
thinking as well, so that style and thought interact with each other in
opening up new ways to think and write simultaneously "critically" and
poetically. Mallarme's essays and poetry, reviews and occasional pieces,
already mocked and attacked by the critics and public of the day, were seen
as going beyond all previous outrage with this new form thus marking to this
day Mallarme as a deliberately "obscure," "perversely difficult and
decadent" and "both vague & hermetic" writer. Emerson noted that "Perhaps
the blank and ruin we see within Nature in is in our eye;" similarly, one
might propose that the obscurity, difficult and perversity which the readers
of the time--and many today--find in Mallarme may have been--and be--in
their own eyes, for, read on the terms which they set forth, Mallarme's
poemes critiques and poetry are actually very limpid, acutely lucid, and, in
the best French tradition, quite logical.

For example, the poeme critique "The Book as Spiritual Instrument" (also
translated as "The Book as Intellectual Tool") may be thought of as
referring to the book both as a tool, a device of instrumentality, and as a
musical instrument.  It is in the musical context which Mallarme here first
envisions the layout of the composition of the musical score which is to be
"Un Coup de des." Mallarme, like Verlaine, aspired to a sense of language
that would attain the heights of "music above all things."  However this
sense of Music, in Mallarme, has two facets: one is a system of sounds which
"plays" so to speak, on the emotions; the other is Music thought of as a
system of  "pure" relations among the notations and the intervals, (the
white spaces of the page in a poem), thus creating a structural system in
the work, which exists without referentiality. Given what seems the
contradiction between a non-referential structure and one that provokes,
elicits, emotional responses which have their own referentialities, the
"resolving" achievement of this mini-gesamtkunstwerke is  then achieved
through the harmonious balance of all the elements within the poem, though
in such a way as to leave them open, provisional, rather than being a total
enclosure without issue for the elements involved. "A throw of the dice will
never abolish chance" as the poem says--

(The structural aspect is part of the huge sea change in the interest in,
study and reputation of, Mallarme beginning in the early 1970's as many of
Mallarme's ideas and poetics acts, works, anticipate structuralist and post
structuralist literary thought in France.  It was at this time that Mallarme
ascended to his position as THE great experimenter, innovator, poet-thinker
of the poem critique of his times, knocking Rimbaud off the throne.)

(This relates, I think, with your sense of improvisations, in which there is
always an opening, a series of possibilities, of choices that are actively
present and there to be ignited at any moment by the poet--it also means
that the poet and the poem in itself can be seen/heard/felt/thought with as
being two players, improvising back and forth, rather than the poem being a
static set of notations on which the poet improvises--for the real challenge
and meaning of improvisation is that two or more poets/players are
exchanging ideas, references, allusions, rhythms, notes, back and forth,
each one encouraging and pushing the other to continually be expanding the
bursts of improvisations playing off of the central theme which runs through
out the poem/music, pushing each other to ever greater and more exhilarating
experiments, realizations, spontaneous illuminations or sudden expressions
of the extreme tension which exists when the balance begins to stray and the
theme is on the verge of being lost beneath too much
"bric-a-brac"--signalling one or the other of poets/players to get a grip on
it and steer the improvisations back towards the "center of gravity" so to
speak.  By this I mean that in your poems, what I find is that the "other"
poet/player is the poem itself, as when you are improvising--it is with the
challenges presented by the poem as it exists at that very moment--the poem
is at once "a part of you" and "apart from you" --it has its own
independence, so to speak, as it is playing, improvising with you. In other
words, it is a manifestation of the uncanny of which Emerson said:  "It is
new to me yet not unknown."

In "The Book as Spiritual Instrument/Intellectual Tool," which appeared in
the June 1895 issue of La Revue blanche, 18 months before "Un Coup de des"
appeared in the journal Cosmopolis (which employed an English typesetter
whose work impressed Mallarme), the poet writes:

"Poetry, close to the idea, is Music par excellence--doesn't admit
inferiority . . . Why couldn't a line--a spurt of grandeur, a considerable
thought or emotion, a sentence in bold type that continues for pages, one
line per page in graduated placement--keep the reader breathless, calling
upon his powers of enthusiasm, for the length of the boo; along with little
groups of secondary importance, explanatory or derivative--a sowing of
frills."

Composing the "Editor's Note" himself for the issue of Cosmopolis in which
"Un Coup des des" first appeared, Mallarme expands and clarifies this idea:

"In this work which is of an entirely new kind, the poet has attempted to
create music using words.  A sort of general leitmotif running throughout
the poem provides it with unity.  Accessory themes are grouped around it.
The nature of the letters employed and the position of the blank spaces are
designed to replace notes and intervals."

You note your thinking of your work in the context of multi-media--here one
finds the dream of French poets of the 19th century when first discovering
Wagner and his works, his gesamtkunstwerke.  Verlaine and Mallarme's
aspiration to "Music above al else" are close to your own sensibility.
While Verlaine--who in French is absolutely breathtaking in the sheer music
of many of his best poems--stayed with the conventional forms of the French
poetry of his day, Mallarme saw the way to the Visual layout, like a
musician composing a score, as a means of emphasizing the multi-vocal
aspects and passages of the poem.  The uses of space as an interval, in a
sense "fills" what seems to be "blank" with the interval of silence,
anticipating Cage's use of silence, among others--silence plays a role, is a
sonic/visual element and event all its own, rather than simply being a
bystander at the "action" of the letters and words as is so often the case.
Silence, then, enters in also as duration--a new way of "keeping time"
within the rhythms of the poem--attending to the silence sharpens the ear to
the entrance of the sounds, themselves also as visual events, forms--the
entire page becomes a site/sight/cite of activation, the prompter of a
performance which, beginning with the mouth, extends to the whole body as an
expressive instrument being played by the poet--thus the desire for a multi
media performance, in which dance, gestures, acting, music, backdrops etc
etc become a part of this activated poem--

The interrelationships among the Visual and the Sonic being performed leads
to this activation of the body--and to the desire for a kind of multi media
theatrical space--or simply a performance outdoors, improvising with
sidewalk cracks, tree shadows moving in the wind--

It is not simply a question of the gesamtkunstwerke as a total work of art,
but of the entire body of the poet/performer as the site/sight/cite of a
multi-media of performance score/visual poem/poem, of sound making, of
gesture, dance, the body itself as a "written character" come to life as a
form of "character"--the body itself becoming the gesamtkunstwerke--

In your works one feels and hears and sees in the minds eye and in the
visual layouts on the page the presence of the body of poet/performer in
action, alive and improvising with the poem itself as an other body, an
other entity, "at once new to me,and yet not unknown."

This to me was the great excitement in seeing your videos, as they present
in action al that the poem is performing on the page, the video presents the
realization, the activation of al the elements so that one can experience
fully what is the confirmation of al that the visual layouts on the page so
vividly represent that it is but a step from the page to the performance,
even before one has seen the performance--so that seeing the performance is
a confirmation of al that one has found made possible on the page--

many many thanks again Vernon!

Dear David,

I will have to return to your detailed post, but at this moment I would like
to make two points:

"one is a system of sounds which
"plays" so to speak, on the emotions; the other is Music thought of as a
system of  "pure" relations among the notations and the intervals, (the
white spaces of the page in a poem), thus creating a structural system in
the work, which exists without referentiality."

It is exactly these "white spaces of the page" which create the visual poem
as a spiritual instrument. It is without referentially because, *at the
moment of its emergence*,this white space does not yet belong to a system;
it is emergent.

I disagree with another point you are making. The double possibility you are
referring does not lead to "two" performers each doing one. It happens in
the reader/performer himself/herself. Therefore it leads to hesitation, to a
crisis in reading, to silence.

Ciao,

Murat

more work on language embodiment, this time with machinery, amazing sound,

everything churning within limited bandwidths controlling both sound and

Subject:      Compulsive Words
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"
Content-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable

BlazeVOX [books] has just published COMPULSIVE WORDS, my fifth book of poet=
ry, based on words that forced themselves on me during composition.



Here are a book description of COMPULSIVE WORDS, blurbs and my bio:



On January 29, 1999, my older brother was near death in a Boston hospital a=
fter emergency surgery for a blood clot in the abdomen.  As I sat near the =
phone in Brooklyn that morning, trying to type up an old manuscript, it sud=
denly occurred to me that I was experiencing an extreme emotion, dread, and=
 that I should see which words this extreme emotion displaced in my mind.  =
While writing the poem "Dread," I perceived certain words repeatedly appear=
ing, forcing themselves on me, taking over the poem.  From then on, during =
composition, I noticed the appearance of these "compulsive words," which I =
first collected in the poem "Compulsive Words" in 2000, and whose number ha=
s continued to grow ever since.

-Michael Ruby



Reading the poems in Compulsive Words is like taking a hard drug.

-Aaron Kiely



Michael Ruby's new book is experienced as a kind of sotto voce diction, an =
unrelenting mumbling in the back of the mind, which takes two very differen=
t forms: as a graphic representation of voices (words presented in diagramm=

A collaborative student project in one of the classes I teach...
A large scale public projection project.
(please forward)

Let me tell you a secret
http://letmetellyouasecret.se/


Let me tell you a secret is a social experiment that will explore an aspect
of the sharing-culture in our contemporary media society. Today it is common
to use online social media such as Facebook, Twitter and blogs to display
details of one?s private life for anyone to see. Our need to share seems
insatiable, people write about anything from breakfast-habits to intimate
relationship problems. Why is that? Is it perhaps a popularity contest ?
competing for who gets the most readers or comments? Is it self-therapy or a
quest for fame and recognition?

We want to call attention to the generous openness and sometimes bordering
on exhibitionistic tendencies of recent generations - the paradoxical
phenomenon that is our public, private lives.

For this project, we will gather secrets from the public. It will result in
a public event in May where these secrets will be displayed anonymously.

This project is carried out by the students as part of a course called
Special Project in the LCDM program (Literature, Culture and Digital Media)
at Blekinge Institute of Technology.


You can send in your secrets through the website, or via SMS. Just type your
secret in a text-message and send it to +46709685070 (your secret can not be
more than 90 characters, including spaces and punctuation). The cost is like
a regular text-message.



The event will take place on 26 May between 9PM-2AM
North side of Fredrikskyrkan in Stortorget, Karlskrona

World Ocean Day is coming up on June 8th. Heidi Lynn Staples
and I are putting out feelers for poets who might be willing to
organize a last-minute reading on their shores as part of a Poets for
Living Waters Action. We're asking poets to serve as Poets for
Living Waters Activists--organizing and publicizing the reading in their
community. If you could also document via photos, video or audio - any or
all, that would be especially welcome.

Ideally the event would take place by a body of
water--stream, river, pond, lake, or sea. The poems read by the featured poets
would be either from the Poets for Living Waters site ( http://poetsgulfcoast.wordpress.com ), well known published relevant works (say E.
Bishop or something), or relevant works by professional published writers. The PLW
Activist (you) would be welcome to read.  An open mike opportunity would conclude the event.

If interested, please backchannel at
poetsforlivingwaters@yahoo.com

Best,
Amy

p.s.  Today's poems are by FRANZ WRIGHT, EVIE SHOCKLEY, KATE SCHAPIRA and BILL MARSH

Sheila Black and Jennifer Bartlett are putting together an anthology of poe=
ts with physical disabilities. =0A=0AWe are ideally looking for poets with =
physical disabilities, although we are not excluding submissions from abled=
-poets writing about a poet with a physical disability. The format will be =
3-5 poems and a short open-ended essay  (750- 1000 words). The essay should=
 address how disability manifests itself (or doesn't) in your work. The ess=
ay can also discuss identity or anti-identity poetics. =0A=0APlease send 7-=
10 poems, a short publishing biography (include your book titles) and an on=
e paragraph description of an essay you would like to write to rejennifer@g=
mail.com AND sheilablack@hotmail.com.=0A=0ADeadline July 1st. Also, email w=
ith any questions.=0A=0APlease see the request and description below:=0A=0A=
Yet our  goal is not to produce a book that is strictly polemical but rathe=
r one that looks at poetry first.  The spectrum of poets writing on the top=
ic, especially today, articulate disability in specific and surprising ways=
. While the poets who make up this proposed anthology are poets whose aesth=
etic lens has been torqued or shaped by their bodies, the group is eclectic=
 as fits the topic=E2=80=94for not only is each disability unique, but even=
 within a single person the experience of disability is a dynamic one. Some=
 poets we plan to include, while forethinkers in the poetry world, are not =
known as =E2=80=9Cdisability poets.=E2=80=9D Rather, they came to have bodi=
ly differences later in life. Some are activists and heavily entrenched in =
Disability Studies. Others, while not activists, write about their singular=
 experience, in ways that are formally and philosophically challenging. In =
addition, the poets included represent many different modes and movements i=
n modern
 poetry.   Part of what is so energizing about considering the current land=
scape of  disability poetry is the degree to which thinking about disabilit=
y enlists or engages viscerally many of the core concerns  animating other =
poetry movements from the New Formalists to the New Sincerity to the Gurles=
que.  The mediations on the body and commodification, and on the very natur=
e and being of beauty, that drive many of the poets in this collection are =
concerns that are not only universal, but also acutely urgent in our times.=

(this post is also up at PhillySound with photos and links:
http://PhillySound.blogspot.com)


Sometime in the 1980's my friend Maria Fama invited me over to her
South Philly home for dinner.  We spent most of our time talking about
poetry, but at one point she brought out a record album and said, "I
really want you to hear this.  Listen to this with me."  It was Umm
Kulthum.  I still remember sitting there with her, exchanging bursts
of surprise with her.  The recording PIERCED, it had no other solution
in mind but to grab you by the neck and force its blade into your gut.
 As though music is a SOLUTION to the human condition, music and
poetry, Umm and her band of poets PIERCING US ONE AT A TIME!  It's
impossible to find one word to express the love for this experience.

Maria made a cassette tape of the album for me.  And while that was
being made she told me of visiting friends in Cairo back in the
1970's.  They said, "Maria we have a surprise, we want to take you to
hear Umm Kulthum sing!"  Maria like 90 percent of western culture
didn't know who Umm Kulthum was.  She expected to go to a nightclub,
but no, it was an enormous stadium.  There were thousands of people.
Umm was frail and old by then, but she still had power in her voice.
The crowd would jump from their seats and scream at the end of a line
of music.

All the poets of Egypt and the rest of the Arab world wanted to write
for Umm.  She remains one of the most celebrated singers in the world.
 She remains one of the most recorded voices in history.  She still
remains virtually unknown in America.  But the day after seeing Maria
I went into a small falafel shop in Philly called BITARS, and I asked
the man behind the counter if he had ever heard of Umm Kulthum.  "UMM
KULTHUM?  YES YES OF COURSE I KNOW UMM KULTHUM!"  It caused so much
excitement!  The other man working with him telling him GET THE BAG
GET THE BAG!  He pulled an enormous, clear plastic bag out of a large
drawer FILLED with Umm Kulthum cassette tapes.

All through the early 1990's my friends and I would pour over Umm's
cassette's, share new ones.  Then one day Maria Fama called me to tell
me of a documentary coming to Philadelphia about Umm Kulthum.  We
went.  It was so amazing.  It remains one of my favorite movie going
experiences.  The director was there to present a Q&A, a marvelous
woman who was Israeli-American who said that she made the film for
many reasons, but one of them being to build a bridge between Israel
and the Arab world.

Last night, 14 years later, I saw it again at my friend Mary Kalyna's
house with friend Debrah Morkun.  It struck me in the very same way.
Goose bumps.  Umm CHILLS with excitement and longing, her powerful use
of her voice taking you OUT OF THIS WORLD whether you intended to go
or not.  It's bliss.  It's ecstasy, Umm is better than any drug I've
ever taken.

I'm a HUGE Umm Kulthum fan all over again today!

Ekphrastic Nexus



Friday, June 25 (6 p.m.) at Chicago Urban Art Society



"Ekphrastic Nexus: Visual Art and Creative Writing" includes a panel
discussion, followed by performances. This event is part of the "Studio
Chicago" calendar of events. There is a suggested donation, and refreshments
will be provided.



The panel involves writers and visual artists about text-image
collaborations, as well as writers who have gotten inspiration from visual
art, and it explores ways writers make connections with art and the visual
artistic process, furthering the continuum of the artist's studio as school,
gallery, political stance, sanctuary, and muse.



Contemporary writers and artists need a clean, well lit room of their own to
create. Whether physical as a cabin in the woods, or ubiquitous as online
presence, the studio matters to Chicago culture makers because of the many
out-of-time or out-of-ethics rituals it suggests. Making art doesn't have to
be political; this freedom is what makes art radically political.



We will discuss details about the spaces in which we work, whether those
spaces are separate industrial studio space, home offices, or other kinds of
spaces. Also, the nature of the work that happen in those studio spaces
relates to how the spaces themselves are set up, whether the work involves
what is done in solitude, or with collaborations (in physical and virtual
spaces). We will also consider how Chicago institutions and colloquia
opportunities might support Chicago artists and writers.



Participants include Annie Heckman (Owner + Director, StepSister Press),
Krista Franklin (writer, artist, and educator, Kathryn Born (editor of
Chicago Art Magazine), Valerie Wallace (writer and educator), Irina Botea
(visual artist), and Gene Tanta (writer, visual artist, and educator),
moderated by Dan Godston (writer, musician, and educator).



Studio Chicago is a yearlong collaborative project that focuses on the
artist's studio. Through exhibitions, talks, publications, tours, and
research, participating organizations will celebrate the working artist and
reveal their sites of creative production from historical and contemporary
perspectives. With concepts ranging from the "studio as muse," "virtual
studios," "street as studio," and "gallery as studio," Studio Chicago
invites participation from artists and the art-curious.

Global Islands Project -- ongoing series of multi-media pdf-ebooks/field-recordings

intensive examination of small islands and their paradigmatic solutions to
globalism.

Your (Art)world is based on mutual relief at your common corruption. Maybe some
cultures are based on even worse. But that wouldn't change the bad faith of it and as
years go by, you wake at night in terror of your whole life being an act of bad faith,
where everything is self-interest and nothing more, where every human interaction is
driven by a silent, even subconscious calculation of some ulterior motive, to the point
that a sea of bad faith has taken over your whole life, there's no small island left
from which you can even try to build a bridge of good faith, because even that effort
becomes suspect, even good faith is nothing but self-interested, even altruism is
nothing but solipsistic, even your professed agonizing right here right now is nothing
but a gesture, made to the conscience in order to assure it that it exists.

“Scalapino makes everything take place in real time, in the light and
air and night where all of us live, everything happening at once.”
— Philip Whalen


Leslie Scalapino passed away on May 28, 2010 in Berkeley, California.
She was born in Santa Barbara in 1944 and raised in Berkeley,
California. After Berkeley High School, she attended Reed College in
Portland, Oregon and received her B.A. in Literature in 1966. She
received her M.A. in English from the University of California at
Berkeley in 1969, after which she began to focus on writing poetry.
Leslie Scalapino lived with Tom White, her husband and friend of 35
years, in Oakland, California.

In childhood, she traveled with her father Robert Scalapino, founder of
UC Berkeley’s Institute for Asian Studies, her mother Dee Scalapino,
known for her love of music, and her two sisters, Diane and Lynne,
throughout Asia, Africa and Europe. She and Tom continued these travels
including trips to Tibet, Bhutan, Japan, India, Yemen, Mongolia, Libya
and elsewhere. Her writing was intensely influenced by these travels.
She published her first book O and Other Poems in 1976, and since then
has published thirty books of poetry, prose, inter-genre fiction, plays,
essays, and collaborations. Scalapino’s most recent publications include
a collaboration with artist Kiki Smith, The Animal is in the World like
Water in Water (Granary Books), and  Floats Horse-Floats or Horse-Flows
(Starcherone Books), and her selected poems It’s go in horizontal /
Selected Poems 1974-2006 (UC Press) was published in 2008. In 1988, her
long poem way received the Poetry Center Award,  the Lawrence Lipton
Prize, and the American Book Award from the Before Columbus Foundation.
Her plays have been performed in San Francisco at New Langton Arts, The
Lab, Venue 9, and Forum; in New York by The Eye and Ear Theater and at
Barnard College; and in Los Angeles at Beyond Baroque.

In 1986, Scalapino founded O Books as a publishing outlet for young and
emerging poets, as well as prominent, innovative writers, and the list
of nearly 100 titles includes authors such as Ted Berrigan, Robert
Grenier, Fanny Howe, Tom Raworth, Norma Cole, Will Alexander, Alice
Notley, Norman Fischer, Laura Moriarty, Michael McClure, Judith Goldman
and many others. Scalapino is also the editor of four editions of O
anthologies, as well as the periodicals Enough (with Rick London) and
War and Peace (with Judith Goldman).

Scalapino taught writing at various institutions, including 16 years in
the MFA program at Bard College, Mills College, the San Francisco Art
Institute, California College of the Arts in San Francisco, San
Francisco State University, UC San Diego, and the Naropa Institute.

Of her own writing, Scalapino says “my sense of a practice of writing
and of action, the apprehension itself that ‘one is not oneself for even
an instant’ – should not be,’ is to be participation in/is a social act.
That is, the nature of this practice that’s to be ‘social act’ is it is
without formation or custom.” Her writing, unbound by a single format,
her collaborations with artists and other writers, her teaching, and
publishing are evidence of this sense of her own practice, social acts
that were her practice. Her generosity and fiercely engaged intelligence
were everywhere evident to those who had the fortune to know her.

Scalapino has three books forthcoming in 2010. A book of two plays
published in one volume, Flow-Winged Crocodile and A Pair / Actions Are
Erased / Appear will come out in June 2010 from Chax Press; a new prose
work, The Dihedrons Gazelle-Dihredals Zoom will be released this summer
by Post-Apollo Press; and a revised and expanded collection of her
essays and plays, How Phenomena Appear to Unfold (originally published
by Potes & Poets) will be published in the fall by Litmus Press.

Her play Flow-Winged Crocodile will be performed in New York at Poets
House on June 19th at 2pm and June 20th at 7pm by the performance group
The Relationship, directed by Fiona Templeton and with Katie Brown,
Stephanie Silver, and Julie Troost. Dance by Molissa Fenley, music by
Joan Jeanrenaud, and projected drawings by Eve Biddle. This production
is co-sponsored by Belladonna* and the Poetry Project.

There will be a memorial event for Scalapino at St. Mark’s Poetry
Project on Monday, June 21st.

A Zen Buddhist funeral ceremony will be conducted by Abbott Norman
Fisher in about a month with the arrangements in a subsequent
announcement. Tom requests that in lieu of flowers, Leslie's friends
consider a charitable donation in her memory to: Poets in Need, PO Box

             to make my mind be actions outside only. which they are.
that collapses in

grey-red bars. actions are life per se only without it.

          (so) events are minute — even (voluptuous)

                         ––Leslie Scalapino
